1
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:46,339
Panelstory

2
00:00:57,743 --> 00:00:59,944
Or the genesis of a community

3
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,088
What are you doing, you idiot?

4
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:31,084
Listen, where's No. 2786?

5
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,280
Haven't a clue.

6
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:41,879
We'll be late for school.

7
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:48,075
Madame, where's No. 2786?

8
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,685
That could be block D.

9
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:57,882
Rubbish! 27 must be E.

10
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,165
Where's Block E?

11
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,284
Over there.

12
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,358
No it's not.

13
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:08,037
Try the orientation panel.

14
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,403
If you can read it.

15
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:18,523
Hey! I can’t find 2786.

16
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:21,159
It's near the self-service.

17
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:24,438
There's a laundry on the balconies.

18
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:27,406
There's a laundry on the balconies.

19
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:34,558
She's crazy!
There's a laundry everywhere.

20
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,677
Do they ever do anything else?

21
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,719
It's those automatic machines

22
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,247
Quite good fun, really.

23
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:02,279
I would have thought
you know Prague.

24
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:08,004
Today it's child's play for a woman...

25
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,078
the washing...
not like old times...

26
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:21,763
You'll drive me crazy today.
Get up!

27
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,807
Are you going to the nursery?
I can take him.

28
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,941
Don't leave me, mummy!

29
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:31,041
I won't leave you either.

30
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:35,276
Block 2786, please...

31
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,399
That's near your place.

32
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:43,481
I can guide you there.

33
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,643
I'll be sad mummy.

34
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,159
Daddy's going to be sad when
he finds out.

35
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:51,863
I'll run away.

36
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:54,081
The police will pick you up.

37
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,884
Look out! He's going to fall over.

38
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:19,159
Watch out for that weirdy

39
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,643
What would he do to me?

40
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,879
If he's the devil he'll chop you into sausages.

41
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:29,085
Why are you terrifying that child?

42
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:33,684
Why don't you ensure law
and order?

43
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,555
What do you mean?

44
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,816
Have you got SPARTA's?

45
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:00,729
There's only twenty a packet.

46
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:03,531
Is that some kind of joke?

47
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:06,800
You said it!

48
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:16,396
Look what everyone throws away.

49
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,444
They probably aren't very hungry.

50
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,723
Maybe today
but what about tomorrow?

51
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:28,125
Why don't they use their brains?

52
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,538
If only my rabbits
could see all that bread!

53
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:33,485
Can I come and see your rabbits?

54
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,674
I would love to give daddy
a rabbit.

55
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,012
That's very sweet of you.

56
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,164
I need a present for dad in a hurry.

57
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,198
In a hurry!

58
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:47,846
You always want

59
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:51,403
everything in a hurry.

60
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:55,125
Everyone's in a hurry...

61
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:59,479
What a beautiful pair of antiers!

62
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:03,117
They should make somebody happy.

63
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:31,041
What a dreadful path!

64
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:33,530
It'll be ship-shape in a week.

65
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:48,239
I'm booked for 11 o'clock.
Do you think you I'll make it?

66
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:54,959
We're not interested
comrades in holding up proceedings

67
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,639
What happened to the door?

68
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,803
Broke this morning

69
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,558
The kitchen.

70
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:34,723
Is it the same everywhere?

71
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:37,199
Of course.

72
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:38,264
The quality of the painting

73
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:41,739
You won't find the like anywhere today

74
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,797
It turned out better
than I expected.

75
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,227
Shall we go down to the basement?

76
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:54,407
Let's look at all the
flats first.

77
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,607
We'll be here till midnight.

78
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,932
It's really wonderful.

79
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,827
According to the regulations,
something's missing here.

80
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:03,922
Cutlery drawers.
Ready for the house-warming.

81
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:09,447
We're wasting time.

82
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:12,527
You won't find flats
of this quality

83
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:16,207
anywhere else in the vicinity.

84
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:19,005
There's no stove!

85
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:24,167
Damn... Oh yes...it's
been reported...undergoing repairs.

86
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,572
Isn't that the gas-pipe?

87
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,372
You could at least have it painted.

88
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:33,561
Sir...excuse me, Comrade,
has the construction actually been finished?

89
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:38,127
Just a few minor details...

90
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,004
But this is horrible

91
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,442
It was designed that way.

92
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,251
Was it like this in the other flat?

93
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,196
Of course.

94
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:51,320
Listen why isn't that a little further away?

95
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,684
You can't even fit a table in here.

96
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:58,132
Some architects!

97
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:02,167
I bet there wasn't
a single woman among them.

98
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:03,892
Come on, lay off!

99
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,646
You’ll be re-sealing
this of course.

100
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,315
The water's been cut off.

101
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,685
Come and have a look.

102
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,561
The lino is full of bubbles.

103
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:20,127
Watch it! That's my hand!

104
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:23,802
Shit! Let me go!

105
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,843
The basement is all right,
just sign the dotted line...

106
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,447
I can't afford to waste my time

107
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:51,412
When will it be repaired?

108
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:54,309
Where a I supposed
to find labourers?

109
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:56,492
It would upset our plan.

110
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:59,167
That would take at least two months.

111
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,670
He’ll never make it

112
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,507
I'm going to be living here too.

113
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,247
I want my flat to be perfect.

114
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:18,564
This is the boiler-room.

115
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:23,248
That's rather colourful!

116
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,531
There's paint missing here.

117
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,628
They must have run out.

118
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,353
The insulation is defective.

119
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,652
Who closed the door?

120
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:44,073
Me.

121
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,238
Why?

122
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,968
It was draughty.

123
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,336
We're in the shits.

124
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,167
Why what's the matter?

125
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:57,645
The door handle's on the
other side.

126
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:08,004
Mummy! Help!

127
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,767
You ought to do the door-bashing.

128
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,652
It's your bloody shambles!

129
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:18,364
Always me! You
keep putting pressure on us,

130
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,042
and we end up
in impossible situations.

131
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,126
I'm going to tell on you
for stealing.

132
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:27,811
I don't believe
in impossible situations.

133
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:28,605
Things could be much worse.

134
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:39,282
Are you normal?

135
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:43,196
I've just washed that.

136
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:46,565
Why shout at us? We didn't do it.

137
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm meant to have a child in this?

138
00:16:57,487 --> 00:16:58,886
Who started the fire?

139
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:03,083
What a mess!

140
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,997
You still haven't got any mail?

141
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,327
Ever seen him without his pyjama.

142
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:14,767
Yes, on T.V. In a series.

143
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,205
"The Driver".

144
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:17,640
Have you seen it?

145
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,700
I'm dead beat in the evenings.

146
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,806
I can't laze around
bed all day

147
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,758
and show myself off
in the evenings.

148
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,490
Well? Any letters?

149
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,719
Hang on a minute.

150
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:35,800
Haven't I got a right
to do my own shopping?

151
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,378
They've just got in some
sausages.

152
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,725
Hello!

153
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,860
What a lovely little boy!

154
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:52,697
It's a girl!

155
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:56,444
No kidding? How sweet!

156
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,165
I bet she is a good girl!

157
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:07,085
Good morning, madam.

158
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,478
What’s wrong with the old lady?

159
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,959
Nothing.

160
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:16,083
You don't know her?

161
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:17,319
I mind my own business.

162
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,124
But you live in the same building.

163
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:42,852
Let me go!
You're not my mother.

164
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,927
Stop arguing.
We're going to your mother's.

165
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,157
I know my own way.

166
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,012
Just look at my hair!

167
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,447
You should have come earlier.

168
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,797
I can't take you now.

169
00:18:58,967 --> 00:18:59,553
My God! Where's that boy?

170
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,236
There he is.

171
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,997
Where can I get a pedicure?

172
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,807
You have to have an appointment.

173
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:11,519
For a pedicure? What do I do?

174
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,760
My God!

175
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:19,196
Someone must have used a razor.

176
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,102
It was you, wasn't it?

177
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:22,053
No.

178
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,727
How come you're not in
the nursery?

179
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:26,479
A pedicure, please.

180
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:28,565
Hand me the razor.

181
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:35,396
You've had it, haven't you?

182
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:38,269
Coming home from work?

183
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,861
No from a dance.

184
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:43,517
Do you know what's wrong

185
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:45,998
with the old woman up there?

186
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:49,478
Nothing, she's always like that.

187
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:56,322
Doesn't she go out at all?
Doesn't she need anything?

188
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:59,372
Why don't you mind
your own business?

189
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:03,366
If only I could sleep
as much as she does.

190
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,325
Hello.

191
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:37,842
Hello.
What are you doing here?

192
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,171
Come to watch you work.

193
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,896
Aren't you pleased?

194
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:44,623
Of course.
How come you're not at school?

195
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,609
Does it make any difference?

196
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:47,406
What happened?

197
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:48,964
I want a bread-roll.

198
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,515
Go and take one.

199
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,317
A lot.

200
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:01,329
Is that what you’d like?

201
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:02,803
Certainly not!

202
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,639
That's pretty hopeless then.

203
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:11,077
What's going on here?

204
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:13,602
Trust you to go
tidying up shelves!

205
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:20,739
Sonia! You looking for me?

206
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,806
No.

207
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,903
How come you aren't at school?

208
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,837
What do you mean?

209
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,412
You're not going to start
wagging school?

210
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:35,524
First sick, then the doctor's.
Did you really see the doctor?

211
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,172
Yes.

212
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,404
What sort of check up was it?
You didn't just make up?

213
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,603
You can be quite sure of that mum.

214
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,367
What's wrong with you then?

215
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,847
You never told me anything.

216
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:49,572
You never asked.

217
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:52,327
When was I meant to?
You're always sleeping.

218
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:54,732
I was tired.

219
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,883
How do you expect

220
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:59,301
to get through med school?

221
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,556
You've got the brains for it.

222
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,445
Do you know what it means

223
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:05,972
to be independent

224
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:10,845
to be in a good position?

225
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,118
I don't want be independent.

226
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,999
Would you prefer to be
a maid or a cook

227
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:18,995
slaving away
for a good to nothing?

228
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:22,407
Could be quite fun.

229
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:26,932
If you are not independent

230
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:29,083
you are worthless
in the eyes of men.

231
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,557
I don't get you.

232
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:35,278
Are you soft in the head?
What’s on your mind?

233
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:36,644
Marriage for example.

234
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:41,566
Just drop the idea!
I won't have such nonsense.

235
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,546
But you'll just have to,
mother.

236
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:47,365
The doctor told me I'm pregnant.

237
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,835
Do you realize
what you are saying?

238
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,395
Of course.
Please, don't make a scene.

239
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,750
One lot comes today,
repairs something...

240
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,485
tomorrow another lot comes
and digs it up.

241
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:40,767
If they'd only plant
vegetables instead

242
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:43,017
we'd have something to eat.

243
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:45,232
Something for our health, eh?

244
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:48,396
Carrots, celery...

245
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:50,977
They wouldn't last long.

246
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,498
Stolen overnight, I'd say.

247
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:03,611
Just don't start getting
in their way.

248
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,339
Getting in whose way?

249
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,595
I'll do the shopping...

250
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:17,111
and the pub' not far.

251
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:22,762
The main thing's the lift.

252
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:31,606
But it's calling for trouble,
to mix the young with the old.

253
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:33,852
You think so?

254
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:37,807
If I was you,
I'd mind my own business.

255
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,092
And if I fall ill?

256
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,823
Who's going to bother about me?

257
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,520
You think those young ones will?

258
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:09,487
If they start quarrelling
I'll just move out and make room.

259
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:12,320
I'll go and join my friends
in the pub.

260
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:15,566
You've got some friends here?

261
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,760
Of course.
Today one has friends everywhere.

262
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,917
Good God! Wait a minute!

263
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:29,685
I've been looking for you
for over an hour.

264
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:32,207
Impossible.
We've only just arrived.

265
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,180
Gentlemen,
that was quite an achievement!

266
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:36,693
What do you mean?

267
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:43,247
No 305.
A first-class balls-up!

268
00:25:43,282 --> 00:25:45,184
A work of art!

269
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:47,052
Impossible!

270
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:47,587
You've got one week to fix it up.

271
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:48,871
That's ridiculous.

272
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:53,119
Pay the bill
and don't forget to smile.

273
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,759
We didn't balls it up.

274
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:03,003
No back-chat, thank you!

275
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:05,482
Who forced us into building
these mock Potemkin villages?

276
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:17,355
You knew all along we'd never make it
if we're to build it properly.

277
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:20,001
How come the others managed?

278
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,078
Probably by not haunting the pubs.

279
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:25,996
We're always left
to fend of for ourselves.

280
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,283
You're just interested
in the bonuses.

281
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,559
We're not soft in the head.

282
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:35,972
Just don't push me, gentlemen
- Wait a minute!

283
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:39,910
You keep your hands off our income
and we'll keep our hands off yours.

284
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,927
I've heard that one before.

285
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,963
The bill's on me.

286
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:48,921
Now you're talking!

287
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,237
Good morning.

288
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:53,677
Bottoms up!

289
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,804
I'm sure we can reach
an agreement.

290
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:03,281
You don't expect
all hours accredited?

291
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,284
I'm not soft in the head either.
- That's a dirty trick.

292
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:11,167
Last time you gave us
only rotten ones.

293
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:15,315
We sell what we get.

294
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:19,240
We had to throw half of them away.

295
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:24,252
What difference does it make?

296
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:27,487
Your children use them
as ammunition.

297
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,159
That's a good excuse.

298
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,562
I saw them with my own eyes.

299
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:42,638
Get a move on!

300
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:47,398
What's going on here?

301
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:50,727
You're still not finished?

302
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:53,844
Go on, hurry up!

303
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:00,767
You copped a beauty!

304
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:02,500
Still hurting?

305
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:04,376
Mind your own business!

306
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:09,685
I'll probably cop one today, too.

307
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:15,439
For stealing.

308
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:18,602
I have to find a present for daddy.

309
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:20,223
You're kidding?

310
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:31,005
We haven't got a single space free.

311
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:37,558
I don't want it for nothing.

312
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:43,283
I'm not an idiot.

313
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:46,764
I know it's going to cost something

314
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,645
I don't quite follow.

315
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:55,959
You think I don't know the ropes?

316
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:59,279
That you can make an exception.

317
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:04,667
Out of question.

318
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:11,438
How come you took
Sarah K. immediately?

319
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:13,707
As soon as they moved in?

320
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:21,322
Her mother greased 500 crowns,
didn't she?

321
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:27,163
That's got nothing to do with me.

322
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:35,444
Of course
we do have a few reserved,

323
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:40,402
but that's for
extremely urgent cases.

324
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,844
I'm one of them.

325
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:01,796
You want to earn yourself a crown?
-Just one?

326
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,478
O.k. Two.

327
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:09,726
What do I tell him?

328
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,398
That I'm waiting for him.

329
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:16,204
Three now and one later!

330
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:32,836
Hey!
You trying to steal something?

331
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,316
I've gone and lost my crowns.

332
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,959
Just look at that kid!

333
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,802
I know him. Quite a character.
From our block.

334
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:03,763
Do you want that paper?

335
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:07,755
You can sell it as waste-paper.

336
00:32:08,207 --> 00:32:13,122
Look, fill up that carton.

337
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:24,040
You sure know how to pass
the buck.

338
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:26,881
You got to use your brains.
It's good training for him.

339
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:31,381
God knows what's
in store for him.

340
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:45,086
Sonia?

341
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:47,245
Is that you?

342
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:52,399
Fancy, meeting you here.

343
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:57,723
Don't tell me!
A little boy?

344
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:02,332
No. It's a girl.

345
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:05,247
It's just that she's a bit bald.

346
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:07,158
She's a darling.

347
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:15,232
So you married John?

348
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,524
No. Frank.

349
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,507
How are things?

350
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:22,719
Fabulous.

351
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:26,845
Take my advice - do what I did.

352
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,163
Like what?

353
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,916
Forget all the brain-washing.

354
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,117
You dropped out of secondary?

355
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:40,082
What the hell's good about school?

356
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,603
I've got a flat,

357
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:45,124
a fridge,

358
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,878
an automatic washing machine,

359
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,285
tons of time in the morning.

360
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:54,925
And Frank's fantastic!

361
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:01,203
What if he turns
out like my father

362
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:04,600
and you end up like me and my mum?

363
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,003
Can I help you, mummy?

364
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,398
Quiet!

365
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,960
I've got to concentrate.

366
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:21,278
They want me to be systematic.
It's driving me up the wall.

367
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,845
A system in this shambles?

368
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:27,810
I'd love to know how.

369
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:28,755
Ouch!

370
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,722
I burnt myself.

371
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,681
That's their stupid system for you.

372
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:39,999
The old bag's bound to gossip.

373
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:43,081
How the hell are you meant to cope?

374
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:54,904
If the milk's gone sour
I'm in the shits.

375
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,684
Jesus Christ!

376
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:08,082
I'll murder you!

377
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:16,617
Who mucked up my laundry?

378
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:19,378
Not you again!

379
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,780
Don't know if I'm coming or going.

380
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:32,480
You might at least answer.

381
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:37,956
Look, I need some sleep, understand?

382
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:42,802
This racket's driving me
up the wall.

383
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:48,166
Nothing could drive you
up the wall.

384
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:51,406
Mummy's going to see it

385
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:54,878
that her little boy's all right.

386
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:59,839
She never burns anything like me.

387
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,685
Her cakes are better than mine

388
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:08,365
She'll be happy - I'll be happy.

389
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:12,401
It's what she always wanted.

390
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:16,123
Just look what your daughter
has gone and done to me.

391
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:19,285
All she can do is cry.

392
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,966
I've had a gut's full.

393
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:28,951
Aren't you feeling well?

394
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,655
Mummy's going to die.

395
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:37,452
Isn't that normal?

396
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,717
She's telling the truth.

397
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,498
I can feel it.

398
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:43,258
Where?

399
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,238
Here!

400
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:48,447
For all you care!

401
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:53,400
Our poor children!

402
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:59,645
It'll be better that way.

403
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:00,448
At least we'll have some peace.

404
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:04,030
The splitting image of her father.

405
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:05,714
Couldn't care less either.

406
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:07,121
But I do care.

407
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,258
Stop lying!

408
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:14,718
Promise me when you re-marry

409
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:18,563
you'll marry a good woman.

410
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:22,277
Don't talk like that.

411
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,236
But I'm so scared!

412
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:27,450
You weren't the first time.

413
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:32,081
I wasn't so alone then.

414
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:35,364
There's someone at the door.

415
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,798
I don't want to see anyone.

416
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:43,567
I'm from the insurance agency.

417
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:45,132
How did you get in?

418
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,247
You just can't imagine
what can happen to you.

419
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:51,412
Do you have a life insurance
policy?

420
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:56,007
Just imagine this wee girl
at the mercy of social welfare!

421
00:37:56,042 --> 00:38:00,942
Or perhaps Madame...
since your son refuses...

422
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:01,813
Get out!

423
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:05,724
Mummy are you dying?

424
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:25,835
Did you tell him?

425
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,103
And?

426
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,719
He hasn't got any time.

427
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,634
He'll never see me again.

428
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:37,320
Come on! I'll miss the doctor.

429
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,643
You promised me one more crown!

430
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,639
That's just too bad.

431
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:45,798
Stupid cow!

432
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:55,669
Where is she?

433
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:56,936
At the doctor's.

434
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,999
You'll never see her again.

435
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:13,087
I'd like the line 10cm

436
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:16,847
from the ceiling.

437
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:24,201
Where would we come to

438
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:28,480
if we had to paint stupid lines?

439
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:31,880
My God!

440
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:39,326
Come on, wait your turn.

441
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:42,086
I only need a certificate.

442
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:46,077
Get ready, Peter, we're next.

443
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:50,686
Anyone could say that.

444
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:55,275
I've got a child with fever.
Just try and push in!

445
00:39:55,847 --> 00:40:00,807
The lady with the baby.
-Just a certificate for the creche.

446
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:04,452
Can't you see the queue!

447
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,706
I can see how long you take
for coffee.

448
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:08,707
Don't we deserve a break?

449
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:13,827
Do you have to make such a racket?

450
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,212
Just look at our working conditions.

451
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,807
Come and watch us cleaning up
after the painters have finished.

452
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:22,372
When will that be?

453
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:26,116
They didn't show up today.

454
00:40:26,687 --> 00:40:30,236
What's he so good at to keep such
a pretty woman to himself?

455
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:35,647
Wouldn't you like to know!

456
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:40,222
May I correct your opinion?

457
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,237
Would you fetch us that beer?

458
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:50,003
You're crazy!

459
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:52,118
Go fetch it yourself.

460
00:40:53,728 --> 00:40:55,625
Would you happen to jug?

461
00:40:57,784 --> 00:41:00,207
Take a bite while
you're down there.

462
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:06,119
I'd like to be done today,
gentlemen.

463
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:08,562
Your wish is our command.

464
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:16,838
This way please...

465
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,685
Karel!

466
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,764
Where's Vilda?

467
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,326
Why doesn't he fetch his own beer?

468
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:39,360
Vilda's quite a guy!

469
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,334
You guys working for the other side?

470
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:46,477
Don't forget your buddies.

471
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:49,644
Shit. I fixed his heap for him.

472
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:55,478
You know something about cars?

473
00:41:57,662 --> 00:41:58,673
I'm in a bit of a jam.

474
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:00,750
You see, this morning
I was meant to see a mechanic,

475
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:05,247
we're doing Macbeth tonight
and I over-slept.

476
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:06,903
You've got a Saab, haven't you?

477
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:09,599
A yellow 99 but it's not running.

478
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:14,342
Can I count on you?

479
00:42:14,343 --> 00:42:14,966
Sure thing.

480
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,422
What do you do actually?

481
00:42:16,423 --> 00:42:17,901
I'm a plasterer.

482
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,411
I thought you were a mechanic.

483
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,200
Jack of all trades.

484
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:29,355
Is that it?

485
00:42:29,356 --> 00:42:30,356
I've seen better.

486
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:37,839
Start the motor.

487
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,212
You crazy!

488
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:46,887
You'll ruin the battery!

489
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:50,367
I said start it not demolish it.

490
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,088
It's hopeless.

491
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,449
What are we going to do?

492
00:42:55,402 --> 00:43:03,642
Did you have to muck around
with it?

493
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:08,579
I never touched it.
I can't bear getting dirty.

494
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:13,910
Perhaps it's just the ignition?

495
00:43:16,145 --> 00:43:17,127
Got any alcohol?

496
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:19,692
What for?

497
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:23,227
Do you realize the responsibilities

498
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:26,727
I have on this construction site?

499
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:30,481
Take it easy.

500
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:33,971
Soviet or Polish?

501
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:35,368
Makes no difference.

502
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,757
Both.

503
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:42,637
Can't get it to start?

504
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:47,194
That's right, Grandpa.

505
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:48,884
If I was you I'd fix it.

506
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:55,084
Watch it, Grandpa.

507
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:58,717
I know quite a bit about cars.

508
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:03,355
It's dry!

509
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:10,400
I'll go get some distilled water.

510
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:17,519
Jesus, my magazines have gone!
They were in big parcels.

511
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:22,280
Didn't anyone see them?

512
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:24,916
Do I have to look after you as well?

513
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:27,686
Don't keep dawdling off shopping

514
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:29,611
and no one will steal your magazines.

515
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:34,042
Here’s the key.
You're to wait for him.

516
00:46:36,887 --> 00:46:39,526
I'll take you there.

517
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:44,322
Why always us?
Why don't they do it?

518
00:46:44,527 --> 00:46:47,218
Stop arguing!

519
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:48,747
Why not Jarda and Joey?

520
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:50,769
Last time they repaired your mess,

521
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:52,095
this time you repair theirs.

522
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:54,235
For the last bloody time.

523
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:00,796
Law and order!

524
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:03,565
Magazines stolen
and not a single clue.

525
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,955
At least no one stole
the policeman.

526
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:10,802
Leave my waste-paper alone!

527
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:14,716
I know where you got it.

528
00:47:15,007 --> 00:47:17,043
Catch them!

529
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:20,837
It was just lying around!

530
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,471
Who on earth threw it out?

531
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:28,093
It stinks!

532
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:30,161
You stink!

533
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:33,001
Is that your pram, lady?

534
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:36,604
Sweetheart,
look what they have done!

535
00:47:39,847 --> 00:47:42,122
You stole it from me!
Arrest him!

536
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,801
The pram was just lying around.

537
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:47,861
In front of the dispensary!

538
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:50,636
My sweety had her vaccination

539
00:47:50,653 --> 00:47:56,082
look, it hurty hurts here...

540
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:59,442
and they just flog your pram,

541
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:02,558
the naughty naughty people.

542
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:04,604
The little boy yours?

543
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:06,155
Let's take it back.

544
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,848
You're just going to let them go?

545
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:09,597
I'll lodge a complaint.

546
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,678
Damn it,

547
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:19,647
the lock's broken.

548
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:25,602
Someone's gone and janned it...

549
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:32,565
The key’s inside!

550
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:41,770
Some idiot's
slammed the door shut.

551
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:48,478
But there's someone inside!

552
00:48:55,087 --> 00:48:58,124
One of the boys.

553
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,756
Trust us to come
at the right moment.

554
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:03,364
Who could it be?

555
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,523
Leta's give them a fright.

556
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:07,918
Pass us the hammer!

557
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:11,466
Break down the door.

558
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,125
Break down the door.

559
00:49:15,807 --> 00:49:17,206
No!

560
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:20,807
She's already been done!

561
00:49:20,842 --> 00:49:23,928
It's my flat.

562
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:26,765
What do you mean?

563
00:49:26,927 --> 00:49:29,338
No one's moved in yet.

564
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:33,479
I've done my own moving in.

565
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:38,081
How did you get the key?

566
00:49:38,287 --> 00:49:39,803
Just try and move me!

567
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:41,080
That's out of the question.

568
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:47,085
In socialism one simply doesn't

569
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,427
throw people out on the street.

570
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:53,252
No one said anything like that.

571
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:56,279
We don't give a stuff
when people move in.

572
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:59,052
You don't, but we do.

573
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:03,239
We've been waiting five years for this flat.

574
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:06,484
Take it easy!

575
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:09,865
We just dropped in to see...

576
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:10,642
I said No!

577
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:16,476
We won't bite.

578
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:18,678
So you'd like a bite, would you?

579
00:50:19,774 --> 00:50:21,157
What else?

580
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:22,695
Just have a look.

581
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:26,199
At the taps.

582
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:30,732
Dirty pigs! Shame on you!

583
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:34,567
You won't be seeing any taps here

584
00:50:34,602 --> 00:50:36,292
least of all mine!

585
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:39,922
Everything’s O.k. then?

586
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:44,817
I'll give it to you in writing.

587
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:47,850
Home and hosed!

588
00:50:47,851 --> 00:50:48,888
I'd submit that

589
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,589
for an innovation bonus.

590
00:50:51,464 --> 00:50:57,047
Just let everyone move in
who hasn't got anywhere to stay.

591
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:03,010
Save ourselves this stupid work.

592
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:04,805
Sure, no more complaints,

593
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:09,161
they'd be only to happy

594
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:13,485
to do the finishing themselves.

595
00:51:14,727 --> 00:51:16,683
They won't pass that.

596
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,837
Sorry.

597
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,283
Not at all, Maestro...

598
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:42,136
You recognized me?

599
00:51:42,137 --> 00:51:46,269
Everybody knows you.

600
00:51:47,527 --> 00:51:49,833
My private angel from heaven...

601
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,282
Beg your pardon?

602
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:55,439
My guiding light...

603
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,032
I hardly deserve such...

604
00:52:00,488 --> 00:52:02,212
Have you seen the old hag?

605
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:07,235
The postwoman...the old witch?

606
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:18,797
Without you life is a black desert.

607
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:20,905
Could you lend me 300 crowns?

608
00:52:21,658 --> 00:52:24,122
Like a nut-house here!

609
00:52:24,527 --> 00:52:26,438
Like sleeping under the bridge!

610
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,147
Tony! Come back to bed!

611
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:30,943
Shit! What a life!

612
00:52:30,978 --> 00:52:33,163
If you don't

613
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,683
I won't let you back in.

614
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:40,163
I just love getting bossed about.

615
00:52:40,652 --> 00:52:41,959
You bastard!

616
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,437
Christ! What a life!

617
00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:45,783
Has the postwoman been...?

618
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:46,589
Haven't a clue.

619
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:56,495
Bloody woman!

620
00:53:01,287 --> 00:53:04,327
Doesn’t what’s his-name
live here?

621
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:06,248
"The Driver"?

622
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:08,214
You some sort of wise guy?

623
00:53:08,215 --> 00:53:10,819
I mean the guy from the series.

624
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,779
Go jump in the lake!

625
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:45,206
You’ll burn a hole in the carpet.

626
00:53:47,487 --> 00:53:48,875
You’re Misa, right?

627
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:52,477
What Misa?

628
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:54,797
What are you doing here?

629
00:53:55,927 --> 00:53:57,963
Cleaning up.

630
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:03,885
O.K. Clean up and I’ll watch.

631
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:08,839
I didn't believe you at first

632
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:14,085
but considering your clumsiness
I guess you must be a charlady.

633
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:16,801
What else could I be?

634
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:19,800
You might have been Peter's girl!

635
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:24,035
Only she's more clever.

636
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,919
Your Peter's a bit thick, is he?

637
00:54:30,622 --> 00:54:35,046
No, just a little lazy.

638
00:54:35,196 --> 00:54:35,988
How come?

639
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,082
Because he can afford to be.

640
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:46,727
I thought he gave you the keys.

641
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:50,940
We already had a similar affair.

642
00:54:52,007 --> 00:54:54,061
What sort of affair?
-An accident.

643
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:02,241
That sort of accident men have.

644
00:55:02,487 --> 00:55:05,600
Why don't you stick
to your cleaning?

645
00:55:25,847 --> 00:55:28,680
Does that idiot live here?

646
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:30,645
The actor, that is.

647
00:55:30,887 --> 00:55:32,525
I don't know.

648
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:34,743
Stupid cow, knows fuck all.

649
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:46,676
Hello.

650
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,578
I live on the third.
Which floor, Madame?

651
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:49,948
The sixth.

652
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:51,448
What a pity!

653
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:07,722
That's a great perfume.

654
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:24,367
Really fantastic!
What brand?

655
00:56:24,402 --> 00:56:26,610
"Je reviens".

656
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:28,818
You speak French?

657
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,590
Is that so surprising?

658
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:34,843
Just imagine where I could be

659
00:56:35,487 --> 00:56:39,116
if I could speak French!

660
00:56:41,127 --> 00:56:45,287
I got a letter from Paris
a couple of weeks ago.

661
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:48,279
I still don't know what's in it.

662
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:50,523
The lift has stopped.

663
00:56:52,007 --> 00:56:56,080
What a pity.
The shape of your lips...

664
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:58,538
Using a letter as bait?

665
00:56:58,869 --> 00:56:59,542
I wouldn't dare.

666
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:02,497
But could I invite you for a cup of tea?

667
00:57:02,847 --> 00:57:06,683
Just a couple of steps from here.
We could take the lift.

668
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:10,520
That's very kind of you
but I can't spare the time Mr.

669
00:57:12,487 --> 00:57:14,003
Jiri Kodes.

670
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:17,243
We’ve met before?

671
00:57:17,352 --> 00:57:19,967
You've probably seen me playing.

672
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:23,723
Oh, you're the tennis champion!

673
00:57:24,807 --> 00:57:26,321
Where's the lift?

674
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:27,076
The mail’s here!

675
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,324
My Money!

676
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:32,917
My humblest respects, Madam.

677
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:38,282
Don't forget, the third floor.

678
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:55,197
Hello. What do you want?

679
00:57:55,232 --> 00:57:57,628
Could I speak to Mr. Novak?

680
00:57:58,172 --> 00:57:59,614
He's not in.

681
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:01,506
Where is he?

682
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:02,670
I don't know.

683
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,732
When will he be back?

684
00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:05,972
I don't know.

685
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:16,772
Who's that?

686
00:58:17,064 --> 00:58:17,977
I don't know.

687
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:25,600
If it's Peter, I'm not in.

688
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:33,846
Stuffy old bitch you got a letter!

689
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:36,124
Did you ring?

690
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:39,319
Here's a letter for Mrs. Kudlackova.

691
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:42,564
That old lady downstairs?

692
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,603
But she's home.

693
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,029
I saw her through the window.

694
00:58:50,067 --> 00:58:53,067
She didn't open when I rang.

695
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,880
Perhaps she's sick.

696
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,934
I don't like the look of that.

697
00:59:07,087 --> 00:59:09,442
...there are still a few men left

698
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:14,441
with whom you can spend
an evening

699
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:25,237
without regretting later...

700
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:27,852
How old can she be?

701
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:30,799
I'd say 15...perhaps 50?

702
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:34,597
A talent destroying illusions!

703
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:38,083
Are you taking
this letter seriously?

704
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:40,238
Why not?

705
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:44,917
It's flattering for you.

706
00:59:48,807 --> 00:59:51,799
Don't you tolerate emotions?

707
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,878
Like you, huh?

708
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:06,807
Why does such a charming woman

709
01:00:06,842 --> 01:00:09,480
have to keep pretences?

710
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:14,277
What do you mean?

711
01:00:16,287 --> 01:00:18,243
You don't even know me.

712
01:00:18,487 --> 01:00:20,637
Down-to-earth...

713
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:25,715
ironic...

714
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,003
redheaded...cold-blooded...

715
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:33,797
That's me!

716
01:00:35,447 --> 01:00:37,722
Don't you like it?

717
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,719
On the contrary.

718
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:44,207
It's precisely what a woman needs
to remain independent.

719
01:00:44,242 --> 01:00:46,004
Pleasant things don't count

720
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:50,200
just the useful, right?

721
01:00:56,527 --> 01:01:00,122
I don't quite get the picture.

722
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:04,115
That's precisely the point.
People lack imagination.

723
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:11,236
See all those right angles?

724
01:01:12,487 --> 01:01:14,876
Those straight lines?

725
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:21,002
Not a single redundancy.

726
01:01:23,007 --> 01:01:30,577
Architects adore economy.

727
01:01:34,396 --> 01:01:38,566
Man mirrors his surroundings.

728
01:01:38,607 --> 01:01:42,441
I'd never thought of that.

729
01:01:42,727 --> 01:01:45,480
See that patch on the lawn?

730
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,522
Someone does some planting

731
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:53,158
everyone else's taking a short-cut.

732
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:57,880
In other words,
the quickest way to your goal.

733
01:01:58,287 --> 01:02:01,687
Haven't personal relations
also begun

734
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:04,121
to take vulgar short-cuts?

735
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:06,787
People like to know

736
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:10,374
what they can expect.

737
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:13,892
When they do get there

738
01:02:13,927 --> 01:02:15,532
it doesn't give them any pleasure.

739
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:18,798
Without harmony and beauty
life would be meaningless for me.

740
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:24,803
And tomorrow?

741
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:29,678
Don't spoil this moment

742
01:02:30,887 --> 01:02:33,606
pussy cat.

743
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,669
Open up!

744
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,056
Don't knock so hard.

745
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:45,332
Break the door down!

746
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:47,573
She's scared of me.

747
01:02:48,073 --> 01:02:49,735
Because you are black?

748
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:50,923
No... No...

749
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:23,923
Did you ring?

750
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:27,603
Yes, Maestro, me...

751
01:03:28,047 --> 01:03:30,163
What do you want?

752
01:03:30,447 --> 01:03:32,881
The little girl...

753
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,559
What actually did you want?

754
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:39,796
Mummy's terrible sick.

755
01:03:40,047 --> 01:03:42,117
She's dying. Please help.

756
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:46,036
Me? Maestro, couldn't you...

757
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:48,676
What happened?
- No idea.

758
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,078
What's your name?

759
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:54,120
Helena Vondrackova.

760
01:03:54,687 --> 01:03:57,599
Where do you live?

761
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:03,163
Upstairs.

762
01:04:03,487 --> 01:04:05,637
Mummy. Please don't die!
Please help.

763
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:15,967
What was that?
-I don't know.

764
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,023
Let's have a look.

765
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:24,404
Listen, you live here, not me!

766
01:04:24,847 --> 01:04:27,077
It's nothing to do with me.

767
01:04:32,527 --> 01:04:35,247
Tony, what have you done to me?

768
01:04:35,282 --> 01:04:37,238
Mummy. Please don't die!

769
01:04:46,407 --> 01:04:49,080
How frequent are the pains?

770
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,557
They don't stop!

771
01:04:55,727 --> 01:04:58,241
Stop that!

772
01:04:58,447 --> 01:05:01,325
Get that child out there!

773
01:05:05,727 --> 01:05:09,242
Is there a phone?
I've got to call an ambulance.

774
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,278
You expect me to wait here?

775
01:05:11,527 --> 01:05:14,405
-One day it'll be your turn.
-Me? Never!

776
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:19,202
Is there a phone somewhere?

777
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:21,253
A telephone? Here?

778
01:05:21,967 --> 01:05:23,011
That's terrible.

779
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:28,360
It's me, Peter... open up!

780
01:05:28,567 --> 01:05:30,558
What's going on?

781
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:35,158
Not a single phone anywhere!

782
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:37,043
I know you're in there!

783
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:44,367
It’s me, Peter

784
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:46,329
...quit fooling!

785
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,871
What happened?

786
01:05:48,767 --> 01:05:51,297
The young woman's in labour.
Run!

787
01:05:51,872 --> 01:05:53,206
Good God! No!

788
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:56,277
That's you men all over.

789
01:05:56,777 --> 01:05:57,956
What could I do to help?

790
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:01,287
I've got to phone an ambulance.

791
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:03,683
Jesus! But I'm an actor!

792
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:05,538
I mustn’t get injured!

793
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:09,400
We're doing Macbeth tonight.

794
01:06:13,127 --> 01:06:18,360
Ah, Sonia!
I didn't think you'd make it.

795
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:24,119
I'd say she's kicked the bucket.

796
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:28,147
I'd say she's kicked the bucket.

797
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:28,971
Who?

798
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:31,777
The old bag, that's who.

799
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,032
Your wife?

800
01:06:33,515 --> 01:06:34,949
No. I didn't even know her.

801
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,309
Then it isn't your flat

802
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,497
we're going to break into,
Grandpa?

803
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:41,111
No but.

804
01:06:41,143 --> 01:06:41,779
Whose is it then?

805
01:06:42,057 --> 01:06:44,199
She just keeps sitting
by the window.

806
01:06:44,552 --> 01:06:45,686
And you don't know her?

807
01:06:46,186 --> 01:06:48,444
I've just moved in.

808
01:06:48,944 --> 01:06:51,137
You could mind your own business!

809
01:06:51,448 --> 01:06:52,725
Come back!

810
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:55,566
I don't want to go to court!

811
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:58,061
I'll take full responsibility.

812
01:06:58,259 --> 01:07:00,607
Just go right ahead.

813
01:07:01,107 --> 01:07:03,964
You're pensioned off,
I'm still employed.

814
01:07:04,464 --> 01:07:08,529
You're not getting me into the shits.

815
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,121
Who's going to open the door?

816
01:07:10,621 --> 01:07:12,733
Call in the authorities.

817
01:07:13,172 --> 01:07:15,819
I know where it is, Grandpa.

818
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,168
It's so cosy here.

819
01:07:25,169 --> 01:07:27,111
But it's still not finished.

820
01:07:29,781 --> 01:07:31,476
Want coffee?

821
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:35,597
It's like a castle.

822
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:38,073
Don't you feel like a princess?

823
01:07:39,607 --> 01:07:42,147
When it rains I spend days

824
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:43,759
looking out of the window.

825
01:07:43,794 --> 01:07:45,336
Don't you have anything to do?

826
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:47,890
I don't do out much.

827
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:48,996
And your husband?

828
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:52,117
They've turned off the water!

829
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:55,798
Just in time for dinner! Damn!

830
01:07:56,727 --> 01:08:00,800
Frank will be furious.

831
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:05,808
What are you doing?

832
01:08:06,308 --> 01:08:09,349
I have to now and then.

833
01:08:10,088 --> 01:08:11,738
They say it's the pressure.

834
01:08:17,047 --> 01:08:19,038
Yvetta's woken up

835
01:08:19,287 --> 01:08:22,006
I'll do it!

836
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:25,166
Hi, honey!
I could eat a horse.

837
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:27,642
Of course, what else?

838
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:30,356
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

839
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:34,247
I've had enough.
You're out every night.

840
01:08:34,282 --> 01:08:35,932
What about your shoes?

841
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:39,198
Stop pinching my backside
and clean up the mess.

842
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:43,159
Welcome home bread-winner!

843
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:45,682
Keep your hands off!

844
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:53,442
No bloody food. No affection.

845
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,922
How come you're wearing
stockings?

846
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:02,839
You know I can't stand them.
I'm going to have a bath.

847
01:09:04,157 --> 01:09:05,351
There's no water.

848
01:09:07,807 --> 01:09:10,666
So the outsiders won again.

849
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,974
Shift!

850
01:09:12,687 --> 01:09:15,247
You gone crazy!

851
01:09:17,264 --> 01:09:20,479
I'm going to find a job.

852
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:23,349
I've heard that one before!

853
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,916
I'm not a maid

854
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:31,916
always tidying up, shopping,

855
01:09:33,687 --> 01:09:37,219
cooking, washing...

856
01:09:38,527 --> 01:09:41,166
and getting screwed by His Lordship!

857
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:44,922
I get the message!
Just as well you told me.

858
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:50,036
But you'll never make good
what I'll lose on the deal.

859
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,046
Couldn't give a stuff.

860
01:09:51,783 --> 01:09:52,795
The bank loan, the car,

861
01:09:52,796 --> 01:09:55,057
the country house you dreamed
up for me to build?

862
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:58,575
You want to stuff the lot?

863
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:06,732
You're nuts!

864
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:10,476
How you going to cope, baby?

865
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,724
Like a charlady?

866
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:19,877
How dare you, you bastard!

867
01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:25,444
Without you I could have...

868
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:28,958
I could have done

869
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:33,359
my school cert!

870
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:36,843
Only you didn't

871
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:42,172
so stop bragging

872
01:10:42,207 --> 01:10:45,290
and let me eat in peace.

873
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:47,276
You're inhuman!

874
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:48,820
I hate you!

875
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,317
I hate these four walls!

876
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:41,165
It's useless.

877
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:43,114
But they're inside.

878
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:45,823
It's outside office hours.

879
01:11:46,323 --> 01:11:47,683
Why are they there then?

880
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,579
Only Wednesdays 2 p.m.

881
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:56,622
Stop! You can't do that!

882
01:11:56,623 --> 01:11:59,793
Imagine if everyone did!

883
01:12:04,452 --> 01:12:05,514
Come on get a move on!

884
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:10,439
But I need an ambulance...

885
01:12:17,487 --> 01:12:19,238
Why did you do that?

886
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:22,123
Everybody would have done
the same.

887
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:24,816
But that's incredible!

888
01:12:24,817 --> 01:12:28,354
Such a gigantic community
and not a single doctor?

889
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:36,647
The old lady in the window...

890
01:12:36,927 --> 01:12:39,282
Perhaps there's a doctor there.

891
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:50,645
Wait for me here.

892
01:12:54,607 --> 01:12:56,647
Didn't you break the window?

893
01:12:59,127 --> 01:13:03,894
Name and address...

894
01:13:03,895 --> 01:13:04,529
Leave me alone!

895
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:09,284
I'll scream you're a kidnapper.

896
01:13:14,967 --> 01:13:18,456
This isn't a barnyard, Grandpa.

897
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:21,525
But it's an emergency!

898
01:13:21,767 --> 01:13:25,077
We only take appointments.

899
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:27,801
Where is it?

900
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:30,722
No. 2756.

901
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:31,820
Floor?

902
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:33,007
First Floor.

903
01:13:33,444 --> 01:13:34,440
Fever?

904
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:35,918
I don't know.

905
01:13:36,418 --> 01:13:37,384
Name?

906
01:13:37,884 --> 01:13:38,858
Koblizkova.

907
01:13:39,194 --> 01:13:39,996
How old's the child?

908
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:42,982
It's an old woman!

909
01:13:48,496 --> 01:13:54,568
But this is an infant centre.

910
01:13:55,107 --> 01:13:58,448
Where am I meant to go then?

911
01:13:59,866 --> 01:14:01,554
No one cares about old people.

912
01:14:02,511 --> 01:14:04,325
Just let them perish!

913
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:09,101
Take it easy, Grandpa.

914
01:14:10,102 --> 01:14:13,253
We'll send an ambulance

915
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,681
Where've you been?

916
01:14:28,367 --> 01:14:30,164
You know she's in labour!

917
01:14:30,487 --> 01:14:35,291
Take it easy! Careful!

918
01:14:40,454 --> 01:14:41,519
I've had it!

919
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:49,919
Thank God!

920
01:14:55,127 --> 01:14:57,721
Mummy! I'm coming with you!

921
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,838
Do something!

922
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:05,796
You are a woman, aren't you?

923
01:15:21,807 --> 01:15:25,083
I haven't got any time.
Something happened?

924
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:28,228
I've brought your kid.

925
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:30,605
He'll tell you
what he's up to!

926
01:15:30,885 --> 01:15:32,075
Where'd you find him?

927
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,156
Come on, out with it!

928
01:15:34,358 --> 01:15:35,795
Daddy doesn't want me.

929
01:15:35,977 --> 01:15:36,675
You won't believe

930
01:15:37,656 --> 01:15:39,191
how much trouble it took me

931
01:15:40,046 --> 01:15:41,813
to find out the address.

932
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:46,579
Daddy doesn't know about me!

933
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:47,656
All because of a present for Daddy!

934
01:15:47,794 --> 01:15:49,147
Is Mr. Novak at home?

935
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:51,136
Daddy hasn't seen me
for a long time.

936
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:55,047
Hey, you lying again?

937
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:58,167
But you know this lady?

938
01:15:58,202 --> 01:16:00,949
This old rat-bag?

939
01:16:00,984 --> 01:16:03,697
Delightful manners.

940
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:05,567
Just wait till he grows up.

941
01:16:05,568 --> 01:16:08,454
You're in for a shock.

942
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,201
You'll have to pay for the window.

943
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:13,177
What window?

944
01:16:13,677 --> 01:16:15,508
I'd stuff the window if I was you!

945
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:19,119
Just try and you'll see.

946
01:16:20,259 --> 01:16:21,876
I'll have your husband summoned.

947
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,243
You want to do something?

948
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:40,445
Wait!

949
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,043
Stop that!

950
01:16:51,447 --> 01:16:55,087
They just can't stand still!

951
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:09,558
I can't get through.

952
01:17:09,618 --> 01:17:10,412
We've got to get a car.

953
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:13,484
They've already taken her.

954
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,795
Is that your car?

955
01:17:16,863 --> 01:17:17,471
Sure.

956
01:17:18,793 --> 01:17:23,060
Why didn't you offer to drive her?

957
01:17:23,728 --> 01:17:25,344
But she could have given birth...

958
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:29,881
Aha, you've got new covers.

959
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:35,202
I forgot your love of beauty.

960
01:17:36,847 --> 01:18:20,831
The painters have finished.

961
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:23,302
Something wrong?

962
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,003
You liar!

963
01:18:32,807 --> 01:18:36,163
It's him or me. Choose yourself.

964
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:42,686
I don't understand.

965
01:18:42,887 --> 01:18:44,605
What happened?

966
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:47,242
So that's the accident

967
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,436
you've had to pay off. Alimony!

968
01:18:59,287 --> 01:19:02,597
I should have told you earlier.

969
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:08,768
Let me explain.

970
01:19:09,064 --> 01:19:11,477
I'd love to know how.

971
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:16,885
Sinking my cash into this flat...

972
01:19:17,047 --> 01:19:17,994
What cash?

973
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:22,762
The painters for example.

974
01:19:24,007 --> 01:19:28,826
Wore myself ragged for your sake.

975
01:19:43,407 --> 01:19:45,967
Pepicek's here?

976
01:19:47,007 --> 01:19:49,237
You want to see him?!

977
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:56,407
I'm to mother a criminal?

978
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:58,363
What do you mean?

979
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:11,398
The cops ran him in for you.

980
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:15,879
Daddy I'm so happy to see you.

981
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:17,719
But that's not my son!

982
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,919
The old cow locked me up.

983
01:20:21,902 --> 01:20:23,244
Please, let me explain.

984
01:20:23,407 --> 01:20:25,318
Get out! Both of you!

985
01:20:33,527 --> 01:20:34,811
Where've you been?

986
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:36,600
I've been looking for you.

987
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:38,423
Keep him out of my sight!

988
01:20:42,447 --> 01:20:44,627
What happened?

989
01:20:44,628 --> 01:20:46,532
Got to speak to you about the flat.

990
01:20:47,032 --> 01:20:49,873
No one's shifting me!

991
01:20:50,127 --> 01:20:51,868
Come on scram!

992
01:20:51,869 --> 01:20:54,725
Where did you find Joey?

993
01:20:57,647 --> 01:21:00,446
Get that bastard out of here!

994
01:21:01,367 --> 01:21:03,130
I've had the guts full of him.

995
01:21:08,548 --> 01:21:09,482
What's on her mind?

996
01:21:09,927 --> 01:21:12,043
She hasn't got a mind.

997
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:19,551
My sweety!
You gave us such a scare!

998
01:21:19,927 --> 01:21:22,293
I've found a daddy for you.

999
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,941
Say that again?

1000
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:26,719
Let him finish.

1001
01:21:26,927 --> 01:21:29,282
Daddy, give Mummy a kiss!

1002
01:21:31,647 --> 01:21:34,923
You're Mr. Novak?

1003
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:38,683
You seem more like a Novek to me.

1004
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:40,243
Sure, sure, I'm Mr. Novak...

1005
01:21:40,743 --> 01:21:43,951
That's not very nice of you...

1006
01:21:43,952 --> 01:21:45,292
I honestly don't know

1007
01:21:45,293 --> 01:21:49,807
what I did to get this boy...

1008
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:52,816
I quite believe you don't.

1009
01:21:53,318 --> 01:21:54,800
I don't know how long

1010
01:21:54,801 --> 01:21:58,364
you've been away from home.

1011
01:21:58,365 --> 01:22:00,401
The kid's five, isn't he?

1012
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:04,357
Stop confusing matters.

1013
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:08,560
Our block has been standing
for two years.

1014
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:15,445
I don't even know him!

1015
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:17,922
Never seen you in all my life!

1016
01:22:18,087 --> 01:22:21,682
What! I'm the caretaker here!

1017
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,522
You ought to be ashamed!

1018
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:26,417
Which one's my father Mummy?

1019
01:22:27,082 --> 01:22:29,936
I've brought him a present.

1020
01:22:35,807 --> 01:22:38,526
Boy, have I had it!

1021
01:22:43,607 --> 01:22:45,677
Look, she's still there!

1022
01:22:46,607 --> 01:22:50,077
Wasn't the ambulance here?

1023
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:55,717
Ambulance?
Sure, they took Memi and Bebi.

1024
01:22:56,567 --> 01:22:59,162
Someone made a mistake.

1025
01:22:59,163 --> 01:23:01,872
No mistake, it's too true.

1026
01:23:02,007 --> 01:23:05,602
Go and have a look.
See if she's still breathing.

1027
01:23:16,487 --> 01:23:19,718
The window's open.
Climb in.

1028
01:23:23,087 --> 01:23:26,762
Mummy, stop writing you're alone.

1029
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:29,558
I am alone as well.

1030
01:23:29,807 --> 01:23:34,403
Don't worry.

1031
01:23:34,967 --> 01:23:37,640
I'm getting on fabulously.

1032
01:23:38,047 --> 01:23:41,722
What does one need in life?
A roof over your head...

1033
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:48,412
We sleep two in a room.

1034
01:23:48,447 --> 01:23:52,102
It's an excellent district...

1035
01:23:52,137 --> 01:23:55,758
that's very important over here.

1036
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:59,317
Please don't think I lied before

1037
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:03,685
but the other district
wasn't quite as good.

1038
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:07,565
There were blacks living there.

1039
01:24:07,767 --> 01:24:08,848
Leave me alone.

1040
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:14,530
People think you belong to them.

1041
01:24:14,565 --> 01:24:17,875
But they have fabulous music.

1042
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:21,124
Don't hurt me. Go away.

1043
01:24:22,207 --> 01:24:24,236
Not be frightened. Me doctor.

1044
01:24:24,271 --> 01:24:26,266
I don't want to see anybody.

1045
01:24:26,766 --> 01:24:28,491
I want to be alone.

1046
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:31,260
I'm afraid of you.

1047
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:37,163
I have nothing to give you.

1048
01:24:38,087 --> 01:24:40,840
Not be frightened.
You too much lone.

1049
01:24:41,687 --> 01:24:44,433
I don't need anyone.

1050
01:24:44,889 --> 01:24:46,424
But you needing peoples.

1051
01:24:46,425 --> 01:24:47,527
I don't need anybody.

1052
01:24:47,887 --> 01:24:51,880
South Africa is a paradise.

1053
01:24:52,727 --> 01:24:56,163
If your skin' the right colour.

1054
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:58,801
Your son?

1055
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:00,838
Me too from Africa.

1056
01:25:03,585 --> 01:25:05,239
C'est vrai, from Mozambique.

1057
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:07,598
This is Mozambique.

1058
01:25:07,887 --> 01:25:10,003
He lives here.

1059
01:25:10,327 --> 01:25:13,125
Quite close really.

1060
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:15,796
His name is Jiri Kudlacek.

1061
01:25:17,927 --> 01:25:21,158
Do you know my little Jiri?

1062
01:26:16,382 --> 01:26:16,965
You mad at me?

1063
01:26:17,207 --> 01:26:21,485
Have I done something to you?

1064
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:28,917
No, not to me.

1065
01:26:30,287 --> 01:26:32,755
To the little boy then?

1066
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,523
Forget it, will you?

1067
01:26:42,807 --> 01:26:45,002
Look at me, Joey.

1068
01:26:49,647 --> 01:26:52,445
As long as we're together

1069
01:27:04,607 --> 01:27:07,075
Lay off.

1070
01:27:08,247 --> 01:27:12,479
That kid got me thinking.

1071
01:27:17,727 --> 01:27:21,003
Let's get married then.

1072
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:25,797
I have already got a son.

1073
01:27:31,647 --> 01:27:34,320
Not another word about that!

1074
01:27:35,007 --> 01:27:37,567
You'll just have to listen.

1075
01:27:41,767 --> 01:27:44,645
Either him or me.

1076
01:27:48,327 --> 01:27:50,238
Farewell.

1077
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,645
You can't do that to me!

1078
01:27:58,755 --> 01:28:00,476
You know what you once said?

1079
01:28:01,807 --> 01:28:04,086
You only have to slam the door.

1080
01:28:24,367 --> 01:28:28,121
Where've you been all day?

1081
01:28:28,407 --> 01:28:30,661
What's wrong?

1082
01:28:30,662 --> 01:28:31,410
I'm not going to tell you.

1083
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,837
Just look at yourself!

1084
01:28:35,838 --> 01:28:37,453
Leave me alone, Mummy.

1085
01:28:38,407 --> 01:28:42,366
What happened?

1086
01:28:44,047 --> 01:28:46,356
Just leave me be.

1087
01:28:46,647 --> 01:28:50,640
How dare you speak like that?

1088
01:28:52,487 --> 01:28:56,761
So what? Something happened

1089
01:28:57,261 --> 01:28:59,167
that shouldn't have happened.

1090
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:02,035
I'm worried about you.

1091
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:05,680
You must understand.

1092
01:29:08,087 --> 01:29:11,284
You're my everything.

1093
01:29:12,527 --> 01:29:13,904
That's just too bad then.

1094
01:29:13,905 --> 01:29:15,207
I'm not yours anymore.

1095
01:29:17,127 --> 01:29:21,086
But you'll find a substitute.

1096
01:29:21,447 --> 01:29:23,119
What do you mean by that?

1097
01:29:23,607 --> 01:29:27,043
I don't meddle in your affairs

1098
01:29:27,247 --> 01:29:29,202
so stop meddling in mine.

1099
01:29:29,443 --> 01:29:32,827
Is that what you want?

1100
01:29:33,327 --> 01:29:37,807
Quit school, have a child
and get married?

1101
01:29:37,842 --> 01:29:39,527
I'm not getting married.

1102
01:29:39,562 --> 01:29:41,572
Brilliant!

1103
01:29:41,607 --> 01:29:42,997
So you'll get rid of the child?

1104
01:29:42,998 --> 01:29:44,396
I don't know yet.

1105
01:29:44,927 --> 01:29:46,812
What?

1106
01:29:46,847 --> 01:29:47,946
I've got to think it over.

1107
01:29:48,147 --> 01:29:50,818
Think what over?

1108
01:29:51,073 --> 01:29:52,584
Do you think it was fun

1109
01:29:53,084 --> 01:29:54,505
bringing you up all myself?

1110
01:30:04,647 --> 01:30:06,721
Bugger my leg!

1111
01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:09,027
Everything's close at hand

1112
01:30:09,527 --> 01:30:11,582
including the pub.

1113
01:30:11,583 --> 01:30:12,801
I know.

1114
01:30:14,167 --> 01:30:15,418
Main thing - you're not alone.

1115
01:30:15,419 --> 01:30:18,629
Damn my leg!

1116
01:30:19,127 --> 01:30:22,452
Look, there's a lift.

1117
01:30:22,487 --> 01:30:24,663
Nothing but peace and quite!

1118
01:30:24,698 --> 01:30:26,839
You don't have to shout.

1119
01:30:27,447 --> 01:30:29,319
Will you turn it off?

1120
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:30,641
What's all this racket?

1121
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:33,932
None of your business.

1122
01:30:33,967 --> 01:30:35,647
Don't be rude, Grandpa's here.

1123
01:30:35,682 --> 01:30:39,083
He's deaf anyway.

1124
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:41,877
What a shambles.

1125
01:30:44,327 --> 01:30:47,080
You still haven't unpacked?

1126
01:30:47,767 --> 01:30:49,254
Hardly worth the trouble.

1127
01:30:49,688 --> 01:30:53,482
Saturday we'll shift your things.

1128
01:30:53,727 --> 01:30:55,797
I'll make room in the wardrobe.

1129
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:58,475
Listen, someone's knocking.

1130
01:30:58,927 --> 01:31:02,840
Another idiot caught in the lift!

1131
01:31:04,407 --> 01:31:07,365
What do you mean - another?

1132
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:17,779
You're late again.

1133
01:31:18,279 --> 01:31:20,245
You know you have visitors.

1134
01:31:20,676 --> 01:31:22,713
Do something!

1135
01:31:22,714 --> 01:31:24,236
Calm down and get out!

1136
01:31:24,736 --> 01:31:25,954
Hands up!

1137
01:31:25,955 --> 01:31:27,915
I'll murder that child!

1138
01:31:29,487 --> 01:31:32,202
Stop shouting! Poor Helen's...

1139
01:31:32,379 --> 01:31:33,888
damn it... she's fallen asleep.

1140
01:31:34,607 --> 01:31:40,319
Who left the bloody lift open?

1141
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:48,235
Where are you?

1142
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,203
Here!

1143
01:31:56,167 --> 01:32:00,080
Helping strangers as usual
and totally useless at home.

1144
01:32:00,327 --> 01:32:02,602
Shout your mouth. And the door.

1145
01:32:06,247 --> 01:32:09,239
Frank for example.

1146
01:32:09,527 --> 01:32:14,123
There's a smart guy for you.

1147
01:32:14,281 --> 01:32:17,279
And don't be rude.

1148
01:32:17,527 --> 01:32:21,042
Stop it! At least for tonight.

1149
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:23,278
Grandpa...

1150
01:32:24,127 --> 01:32:29,326
Without me he'd be on a shovel.

1151
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:31,444
What's wrong with that?

1152
01:32:31,607 --> 01:32:34,041
The stupid supermarket
wasn't my idea.

1153
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:34,817
I can walk out tomorrow.

1154
01:32:34,969 --> 01:32:38,316
And what will you do?

1155
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:43,123
Easy! You'll have a stroke.

1156
01:32:43,407 --> 01:32:47,286
No trade, never lasts anywhere.

1157
01:32:47,447 --> 01:32:50,598
Such a shortage of people
in vegetables!

1158
01:32:50,807 --> 01:32:52,690
If you use your brains properly-

1159
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:54,351
I'll stay in vegetables!

1160
01:32:55,047 --> 01:32:57,630
Isn't it for him to decide?

1161
01:32:57,665 --> 01:33:00,213
What do you mean - for him?

1162
01:33:00,935 --> 01:33:02,454
He's old enough to marry.

1163
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,837
He's just a child, aren't you?

1164
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,950
There's a child somewhere else.

1165
01:33:12,127 --> 01:33:13,430
I refuse to listen!

1166
01:33:13,431 --> 01:33:16,614
I'll murder him!

1167
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:19,202
He can be sure of that.

1168
01:33:19,447 --> 01:33:21,597
Where are you, Peter?

1169
01:33:21,887 --> 01:33:24,276
Leave me alone!

1170
01:33:25,047 --> 01:33:29,837
Grandpa, don't you think

1171
01:33:31,727 --> 01:33:35,356
Doubt if I'll stay on, daughter.

1172
01:33:35,647 --> 01:33:40,402
But you promised.

1173
01:33:41,807 --> 01:33:44,276
I don't feel at home here.

1174
01:33:44,567 --> 01:33:45,670
That's not surprising.

1175
01:33:45,671 --> 01:33:47,934
Shut up! I'm warning you!

1176
01:33:47,967 --> 01:33:51,755
Grandpa's going to think
that we don't want him here.

1177
01:33:51,927 --> 01:33:52,691
Grandpa's O.K.

1178
01:33:52,692 --> 01:33:54,109
It's you I can't stand.

1179
01:33:54,344 --> 01:33:55,109
Keep quiet!

1180
01:33:55,687 --> 01:33:57,152
And you shut up!

1181
01:33:57,153 --> 01:33:59,200
It's the truth!

1182
01:34:00,182 --> 01:34:00,678
Grandpa ought to know,

1183
01:34:00,847 --> 01:34:03,725
you want to swap his house
for a new car!

1184
01:34:03,967 --> 01:34:06,638
You bastard! Get out!

1185
01:34:06,687 --> 01:34:08,518
Grandpa!

1186
01:34:50,647 --> 01:34:53,669
I've been looking for you.

1187
01:34:54,967 --> 01:34:56,074
I was at home.

1188
01:34:56,075 --> 01:34:58,416
I thought you knew.

1189
01:34:58,767 --> 01:35:02,965
I thought I don't have to hurry
if I don't want to.

1190
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:06,967
You don't have to do anything

1191
01:35:07,002 --> 01:35:08,878
if you don't want to.

1192
01:35:09,847 --> 01:35:12,202
Why are you crying?

1193
01:35:12,447 --> 01:35:15,564
I don't have to have the child
if you don't want to.

1194
01:35:16,687 --> 01:35:18,678
I was beginning to look
forward to it.

1195
01:35:31,807 --> 01:35:34,685
Wouldn't you prefer to fly
to the moon?

1196
01:35:34,967 --> 01:35:36,384
Like hell!

1197
01:35:37,561 --> 01:35:39,200
I'm not budging from here.

1198
01:35:47,357 --> 01:35:50,069
The End
