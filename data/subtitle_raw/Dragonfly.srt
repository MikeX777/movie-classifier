1
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,440
<i>I had hit rock bottom.</i>

2
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,995
<i>My friends were gone.
I was sick.</i>

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,950
<i>Then someone appeared
in front of me. A girI.</i>

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,075
<i>I was afraid.</i>

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,437
<i>But she was more afraid than i.</i>

6
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,997
<i>Someone had mistreated her.</i>

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,310
<i>She picked me up from the bottom.</i>

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,031
<i>She heIped me.
And then i helped her.</i>

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,593
<i>So here we are.</i>

10
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,240
Eddie?

11
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,473
Never mind.

12
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,952
OK. l'm cutting the last
of your long hair now. Ready?

13
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,954
There.

14
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,713
Do you think l'm getting old?

15
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,232
-No.
-Are you sure?

16
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,798
l was invisible to you, to begin with.

17
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,874
Have you forgotten that?

18
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,999
No.
l haven't.

19
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,430
You were so sweet.

20
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,076
That is something one never forgets.

21
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,995
What do you want?

22
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,790
-l don't know.
-Figure it out. lt's coming up.

23
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,997
-l don't want to say it.
-But l want to get you something.

24
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,874
All l want is you.

25
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
And l want you.

26
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Now.

27
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,832
-How is it going at the farm, Eddie?
-Fine.

28
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,195
l caught 15 perch yesterday.

29
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,878
-But l'm still no good at casting.
-No, that's difficult.

30
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,198
Here y ou go.

31
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,189
Hi.

32
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
Eddie isn't here.

33
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,118
l think l'm pregnant.

34
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,956
Strange, huh?

35
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,476
l'll let Eddie know you were here.

36
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,830
Eddie?

37
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,235
ls that you, Eddie?

38
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,559
l don't know what to say.

39
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,078
l didn't recognize you.

40
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,514
You've grown a beard.

41
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,112
-lt look s good.
-Thanks.

42
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,350
And you've gained ...

-l am doing well.

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,438
How are you doing?

45
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,188
lt's been a while.

46
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,754
Five years and forty days.

47
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,629
What are you doing here?

48
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,234
Just driving around.

49
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,274
l'm a salesman.

50
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,797
l'm heading to UmeÃ¥.

51
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,635
This is the wrong road.

52
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,991
l can drive where ever i want.

53
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,799
Want to get a beer?

54
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,958
l've stopped drinking.

55
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,714
Just one.

56
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,233
-Two.
-Three!

57
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,433
lt's great to see you.

58
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,194
-What kind of car is that?
-lt's a Chevy.

59
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,598
You look strong.

60
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,518
Go in and pay.

61
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,233
-What's in the box?
-What?

62
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,957
-What's in the box?
-Nothing.

63
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,470
Nothing?
Can i have a peek?

64
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,353
No.

65
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,272
-Do you like my car?
-Your car?

66
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,034
Maria?

67
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,388
-Do you have a Maria?
-l have a Maria.

68
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,355
Eddie ...

69
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,035
Shit!
You've made it.

70
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,033
l think so.

71
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,589
lt's her 25 th birthday today.

72
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,868
25 th?

73
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,309
25 th!

74
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,995
You have to come out
to the farm, meet Maria.

75
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,559
l'll come some other time,
when it's more appropriate.

76
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,757
-Don't you have time?
-No.

77
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,759
Two more beers!

78
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,112
She's afraid of the dark.

79
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,154
Afraid of being alone.

80
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,348
Maria?

81
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,549
Happy birthday to you ...

82
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,200
No, no ...

83
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,631
This isn't working.

84
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,037
Happy birthday to you ...

85
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,637
l can't believe this. l thought
you were bragging about this place.

86
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,633
lt's fantastic!

87
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,155
My uncle lived here. He died
a few years ago. He was a minister.

88
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,239
This was good, Eddie.

89
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,033
Ready for your present?

90
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,238
Warmer, warmer ... colder.

91
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,592
Did you really go to school together?

92
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,229
Warmer ...

93
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,914
Eddie!

94
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,029
What is that?
A hockeystick?

95
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,556
For catching butterflies.
There are so many butterflies here.

96
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,069
Thank you.

97
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,314
l like it.

98
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,469
-Thanks for inviting me.
-Don't mention it.

99
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,632
You have a good life.

100
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,631
Why did i never hear from you?

101
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,837
Why did you never come visit?

102
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,798
Five years.

103
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,313
That's a long time.

104
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,513
Especially in there.

105
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,078
l can understand why
you didn't want to think about me.

106
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,951
l don't want to talk about it.
Not here at the table.

107
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,792
lt's Maria's birthday.

108
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,750
Of course.

109
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,549
Cheers, Maria.
Happy birthday.

110
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,149
Eddie and i have known each other
a long time. We are best friends.

111
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,075
Want to play a game?

112
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,073
You have to close your eyes.

113
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,515
Sit like this.

114
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,280
Arms like this.

115
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,118
Both of you.

116
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,752
Draw a deep breath.

117
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,995
-l knew it.
-That's what makes it so horrible.

118
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,314
You know something terrible
is going to happen.

119
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,795
And then it does.

120
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,113
-Your turn, Maria.
-l don't want to play.

121
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,635
l love your hair.

122
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,838
What are you staring at?

123
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,193
Are you pregnant, Maria?

124
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,715
What?

125
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,348
Are you?

126
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,114
Sit down.

127
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,114
That's great.

128
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,995
Really great.

129
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,592
-He look s like a little boy.
-l don't think so.

130
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,353
Like a little boy.

131
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,996
Bullshit.
He isn't even asleep.

132
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,628
What do you mean?

133
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,194
You're strong.

134
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,316
Everything is going your way.

135
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,913
-Are you proud?
-Yes, l am proud.

136
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,553
And Maria.

137
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,990
Maria della rossa.

138
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,111
-Are you asleep?
-l'm sorry.

139
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,595
l'm the one that should apologize.

140
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,159
l was going to tell you.

141
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,868
lt's OK.

142
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,635
lt's OK.

143
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,678
l can't have a baby.

144
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,908
What?

145
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,238
We can't.

146
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,718
Come here.

147
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,920
Of course you can.

148
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,229
You are going to, and you can.

149
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,798
-You think so?
-Yes.

150
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,958
Thank you.
You are kind.

151
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,156
Can't you make him go away?

152
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,873
He did me a favor once,
now i have to help him.

153
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,234
-The lake is full of perch and pike.
-You eat pike?

154
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,316
-ls it any good?
-lt's excellent.

155
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,031
l put my finger here, let go ...

156
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,559
Up like this, and ...

157
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,878
l know where he lives.

158
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,318
l know where he lives.

159
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,548
Who?

160
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,269
The bastard who double-crossed us.

161
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,758
Not far from here.

162
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,751
He's lived a good life with our money.

163
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,672
That's all
l've been able to think about:

164
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,038
When i get out, l'm going to visit him.

165
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,952
l have nothing, Eddie.

166
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,279
Eddie, i need you to come with me.

167
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,352
l can't do it on my own.

168
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,872
You know the rules, Kullmann.

169
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,312
You'll get over it.
lt just takes time.

170
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,393
That's just the way it is.

171
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,910
You'll get over it.

172
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,676
-lt's been five years.
-You need more time.

173
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,196
-You can't ask me now.
-l just thought ...

174
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,999
You can't ask me now!

175
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,314
Reel it in.

176
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,238
l said reel it in.

177
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,035
-l caught one!
-A real fighter.

178
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,789
Reel it in slowly.

179
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,269
Slowly!

180
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,670
Take the hook out and release it.
lt's too small.

181
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,397
What's with your roof, Eddie?

182
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,960
lt needs fixing.

183
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,319
l know a guy who sells roofing tile.

184
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,559
lt's going to rain into your bedroom.

185
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,278
You have to get that fixed.

186
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,759
l'm holding you.
Don't be afraid.

187
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,989
OK, come on.

188
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,312
l'm holding you.
Come on.

189
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,670
Come on.

190
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,955
Don't forget to breathe.

191
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,189
Keep your head above water!
You're swimming!

192
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,712
Breathe out.

193
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,399
You're swimming!

194
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,514
How is your back?

195
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,600
Stiff.

196
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,510
My dad had the same back problem,
but he never made it out of bed.

197
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,398
You get used to it.

198
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,153
-How is Maria doing?
-Fine.

199
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,798
This is prime topsoil.

200
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,038
Poor things like this
need all the help they can get.

201
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,034
Guess l'll head home now ...

202
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,119
What's this?

203
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,908
Roofing tile.

204
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,708
Where did you get it?

205
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,394
We ...

206
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,677
-We talked about this earlier.
-l didn't ask you to get tiles.

207
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,993
No, but we did talk about it.

208
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,672
-Where did you get this?
-l told you. My friend sells it.

209
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,191
Are you accusing me of ...
Do you think ...

210
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,519
-Do you think i have stolen it?
-No, that's not it.

211
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,275
l just don't know where you got it.

212
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,349
-That's all i'm saying.
-Do you think i stole it?

213
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,308
Have i said that?
Have i used those words?

214
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,076
-Then what are you saying?
-l don't know where you got this.

215
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,074
-So you think i stole it.
-That's not what i'm saying!

216
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,233
-What are you saying?
-That i don't know!

217
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,359
You are wearing my shoes and jacket.

218
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,431
-The shoes were in the hall ...
-Don't you have your own clothes?

219
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,558
-l was wet.
-l know.

220
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,230
These shoes were in the hall!

221
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,873
Shit!

222
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,432
l got you some roofing tile.

223
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,791
You have a leak over the kitchen.

224
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,430
-Aren't you leaving soon?
-What?

225
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,918
Aren't you leaving?

226
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,756
l won't bother you anymore.

227
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,949
Eddie?

228
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,554
Eddie!

229
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,269
Hello?

230
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,838
lt's just a little scratch.

231
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,469
Maria?

232
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,190
Can you help me into the house?

233
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,400
Let's see.

234
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,473
-You have to help.
-One, two, three!

235
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,790
Thank you.

236
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,994
-Can you walk?
-Sure. Let's go inside.

237
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,272
Maria, do you have
a needle and thread?

238
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,509
l cut my self a little,
trimming that spruce.

239
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,273
She's too good for you.

240
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,750
You'll have to help me, Eddie.

241
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,673
-How long is he staying?
-l don't know.

242
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,077
He can't leave now.

243
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,118
He did it on purpose.

244
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,319
Cut his leg?

245
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,951
He knew what he was doing.

246
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,708
No.

247
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,398
l was watching him.

248
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,311
l knew he would cut himself.

249
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,917
-You're saying he did it on purpose?
-lt looked like it.

250
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,471
That's not the same
as actually doing it.

251
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,197
He'll leave when he is ready.

252
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,838
lt's my dog.

253
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,908
You have a dog?

254
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,390
l have a dog.
Tito.

255
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,670
-What's he doing in your trunk?
-He's dead.

256
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,795
Aren't you planning on burying him?

257
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,671
Sure, but l didn't want to
trouble you with that my first night.

258
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,753
l should have told you.
l'm sorry.

259
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,758
Where did you get him?

260
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,070
l didn't know you had a dog.

261
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:33,236
-You know nothing about me.
-l know there's a dog in your trunk!

262
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,632
-l was going to bury him.
-Now. Today.

263
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,357
How did he die?

264
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,873
l backed up over him.

265
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,513
You ran over him?

266
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,876
l backed up over him.
He never used to sit behind the car.

267
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,557
-lt was a tragedy.
-You can say that again.

268
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,796
l'll go bury him now.
You can visit the grave tomorrow.

269
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,590
l've seen you somewhere before.

270
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,834
l don't think so.

271
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,638
Have a seat.

272
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,998
What do you want?

273
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,275
l've seen you before.

274
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,398
-Haven't i?
-l wouldn't know.

275
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,110
You were ... out of it.

276
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,316
You didn't seem to care.

277
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,311
l am also out of it.

278
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,678
Maria?

279
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,399
Are you Eddie's buddy?

280
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,033
Don't want to talk?

281
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,517
Can't you talk?

282
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,030
Eddie ...

283
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,510
l am also Eddie's buddy.

284
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,352
lnto the jungle.

285
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,429
l have used one of these many times.

286
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,670
Mostly Eddie, though ...

287
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,674
That's what happens
when people owe money.

288
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,314
You have to ...

289
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:56,036
You have to use it sometimes.
Even if you don't want to.

290
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,028
Understand?

291
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,834
They didn't understand either.

292
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,199
Until afterward.
Then they understood very well.

293
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,834
Very well.

294
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,994
You be careful with this.

295
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,039
Can a barn just self-ignite?

296
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,470
l've been looking for Bamse.

297
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,437
-Bamse?
-My dog.

298
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,355
He didn't come home.

299
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:42,430
He usually comes home at night
to sleep under his favorite chair.

300
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,036
You haven't seen him, have you?

301
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,193
No, i didn't think so.

302
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,910
Let me know if you do.

303
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,113
<i>Bamse!</i>

304
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,760
Dammit!

305
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,555
What color is your dog?

306
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,871
-Brown.
-Stand up! What color is he?

307
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,715
-Brown.
-Brown? ls your dog brown?

308
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,678
-ls he really brown?
-What's with you? Yes, he's brown.

309
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,590
Did you burn down the barn, too?

310
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,878
l don't know what to say, Sven.

311
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,793
This is horrible.

312
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,549
-He told me everything.
-What?

313
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,318
What's done is done.

314
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,996
Maybe we should leave.

315
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,273
Bye, Sven.

316
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,879
What did you tell Sven?

317
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,991
-l told him we did it.
-What?

318
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,277
l said we ran over his dog.

319
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,193
l told him you backed up over his dog.

320
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:13,234
-Why did you tell him that?
-lt was spur of the moment.

321
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:20,755
l couldn't get my self to say
that i did it, because he was so ...

322
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,749
He was sad.

323
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,232
So you told him that i killed his dog?

324
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,950
lt was hard for me to admit it,
so i said it was you.

325
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,154
He's my neighbor.

326
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,070
He does everything for me.
For me, Kullmann!

327
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,034
Here, where i live.

328
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,232
Let's go back.

329
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,353
We'll go back and tell him the truth.

330
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:17,032
Kullmann had something else
to tell you.

331
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,599
lt wasn't ...

332
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,549
Eddie didn't run over your dog.

333
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,350
l did.

334
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,151
l came around the corner,
and there he was.

335
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,596
He's a big dog, Sven.

336
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,439
He jumped up on the car
and started barking.

337
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,910
He was a good dog.

338
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,958
l think you should leave now.

339
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,559
l mean, what happened ...

340
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,434
You did hard time.

341
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,636
But you know the rules.

342
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,669
You took your punishment.
Took it for both of us.

343
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,674
Say no more, Eddie.

344
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,959
l can't play your game anymore.
l can't.

345
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,794
l am going to leave,
and y ou'll never have to see me again.

346
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,710
Eddie?

347
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,917
l am telling you that i will leave, -

348
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:12,871
- as soon as you help me
with this one tiny favor.

349
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,992
Then i will leave.

350
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,189
What are you doing?

351
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,920
Thinking.

352
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,072
Good thoughts?

353
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,558
lt moved.

354
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,390
-The baby?
-Yes, it moved.

355
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,269
That's good.

356
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,558
-Can i feel?
-No.

357
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,755
-Why not?
-l don't want you to.

358
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,639
lt's perfectly normal.

359
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,354
They kick.

360
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,033
They grow.
