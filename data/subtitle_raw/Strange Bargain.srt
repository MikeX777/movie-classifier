Commitment of Honor

2
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,996
I'm going!

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,274
Haven't you heard
"ladies first"?

4
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,710
Are you in a hurry this morning, son?

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,229
Yes! Today's game
against the Beavers.

6
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,510
- They have a good scout.
- Do they?

7
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,718
Mom, have you seen my baseball cap?

8
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,309
No, dear.
You're not wearing it?

9
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,675
Mom!

10
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,269
I don't see him anywhere!

11
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,435
Oh!

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,712
Not again!
It can't be the first of the month already!

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,638
Bills, bills...

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,754
Dad, I wondered...

15
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,798
don't you think you could...

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,956
- No, I don't think so.
- No what?

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,594
I thought that if I had
a bicycle...

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,718
I want a
bike!

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,832
You can't ride yet!
Wait for your time!

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,874
Roddy, I told you not to
bother your father with this!

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,115
I know, Mom!

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,993
But I can't do without it!

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,077
I've seen a second-hand one.

24
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,475
It's beautiful!

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,315
It looks new!

26
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,480
- I could get it cheap!
- How much?

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,635
Well...

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,918
...28 sticks and 5 cents
for the license.

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,198
It might be enough for the license,
Roddy.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,719
If I buy a girl,
we can put them both together!

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,875
A girl?

32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,913
Not that one!

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,158
Forget everything!

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,589
Hey!

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,394
- I've got to go!
- You haven't finished your coffee!

36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,479
I know, but I don't have time!
I have to train for the game!

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,196
- See you later, Dad. See you, Mom!
- See you, darling.

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,272
-See you, Mom!
- See you.

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,868
Where are you going?

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,991
- I'm going to train too.
- Yes?

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,553
I'll take care of the water!

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,876
I wish we could buy
the bike. You're out of your mind!

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,432
- Georgia, do you believe that...
- I don't believe it, that's what I know.

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,194
We can only face
basic expenses,

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,790
...pay for the house and the car,
and let's not talk about saving money.

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,439
We can't go on like this.
We have to do something.

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,595
But what?

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,392
Why don't you ask for more money?

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,478
It's worth much more than
they pay you!

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,477
I'm just an assistant accountant!

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,798
Yes, but even the auxiliaries and
their families have to live!

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,468
How do you expect us to live
with what you earn?

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,713
They are not responsible for
me having children.

54
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,559
Why don't you talk
with Mr. Jarvis?

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,718
Sam, why don't you ask
today?

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,475
- Okay, I'll see what I can do.
- Good!

57
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,432
Now I'm going or I'll be late.

JARVIS & HEARNE
INVESTMENT SECURITIES

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,757
Good morning, Mr. Austin.
-Good morning, Sam.

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,474
- Good morning, Ms. Vantay.
- Good morning.

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,197
- Ms. Vantay.
- Miss Vantay: Yes?

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,635
I'd like to...

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,153
I was wondering if I could see
Mr. Jarvis today.

64
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,192
I think you can see him now,
wait a moment.

65
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,590
Mr. Wilson wants to see you.
Can we do it now?

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,075
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,278
- Come in, Mr. Wilson.
- Oh, thank you.

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,039
I'm still a member.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,958
Don't you want to discuss it reasonably?
There are other ways, I assure you!

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,115
Come in, Sam.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,956
You've chosen a good day,
you're in an excellent mood!

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,635
Hello, Sam!

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,674
I wanted to see you because...

74
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,598
...I had to do that.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,755
You see, I...

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,634
...my family can't cope
with my salary.

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,398
I'm sorry to bother you,

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,036
...but I think my work is worth more,
the cost of living has gone up,

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,515
...and many salaries with it.

80
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,837
Every month we are at zero.

81
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,392
I was hoping you'd
to give me...

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,194
...at least a moderate increase.

83
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,268
I didn't know you wanted to see me.

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,916
I told Ms. Vantay to
to come in and talk to you.

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,157
- Do you want to talk to me?
- Yes. Sit down.

86
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,557
I'm sorry to tell you that, Sam.

87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,275
By the beginning of next month
we won't need your services.

88
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,235
Am I fired?

89
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,276
Yes.

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,199
Sir, if it's for the increase...

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,152
I'm sorry, you already know
the financial situation.

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,352
We can't go on like this,
we must cut spending.

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,511
I've been with the company for 12 years!

94
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
I was hoping to spend
the rest of my life here.

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,118
We didn't save much.

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,309
I know it's going to be difficult for you,

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,910
...but the company can't take it.

98
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,510
The company will recover!
It's just a matter of hanging in there!

99
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,633
- I could put money in your pocket!
- Money from my pocket?

100
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,795
How funny!

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,673
Do you know how much I have in the bank?
Zero!

102
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,080
- Maybe less!
- Mr. Hearne can do it!

103
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,714
We don't get along,
you know!

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,196
He'll put up money on the condition that I leave
without paying me anything!

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,198
He says the company
has no funds and is worthless!

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,515
And you're right.

107
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,595
He wants the name.
I told him not to talk about it!

108
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,673
I'm sorry, sir.

109
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,469
- I thought you were rich.
- Yes, everyone thinks so.

110
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,592
Just because I have a big house
and cars,

111
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,360
...but the fact is, we're ruined.

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,195
Hey, Sam!

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,516
Shall I drive you?
I'll stop by your house.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,869
Thank you, sir!

115
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,548
And I want to talk to you.
I invite you for a drink!

116
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,715
Great!

117
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,078
I've been thinking.

118
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,268
Maybe there's a way out for both of us.

119
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,954
Let me tell you something
in confidence,

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,720
...something
that could benefit you greatly.

121
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,833
He loves his wife and children,
don't you, Sam?

122
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,195
Of course!

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,595
Enough to die for them,
no?

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,917
I feel that way about
my wife...

125
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,877
...and my son Sidney.
I would die for them.

126
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,394
Sam, I'm going to kill myself.

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,675
The...

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,037
No, you're kidding, Mr. Jarvis!

129
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,119
- You're...
- I'm not drunk. I'm not joking.

130
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,478
I'm planning to commit suicide.
I need your help.

131
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,596
Mr. Jarvis,
think about it twice!

132
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,755
Sam,

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,597
...I inherited 500,000 dollars
from my father.

134
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,069
There's not a penny left.

135
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,239
- But how?
- I'll get to that in a minute.

136
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,472
I can't walk away and leave
my family bankrupt.

137
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,716
I plan to leave them
as much as they left me.

138
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,277
I've been paying for life insurance
for years.

139
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,399
Three months ago
increased by another 200 thousand dollars.

140
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,953
But it's suicide!

141
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,628
- The insurance company wouldn't pay!
- That's it, Sam.

142
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,909
Then you enter.

143
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,388
I want you to make it
look like a murder.

144
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,515
Murder!

145
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,668
I planned everything.

146
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,075
I have a 38, nobody knows that.

147
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,750
I want you to come later...

148
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,439
and take it away.

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,792
Mr. Jarvis, I couldn't
do that!

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,436
I'll be in the library.
I'll leave the safe open.

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,552
With papers on the floor, like
it looks like a robbery.

152
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,389
Take the gun, get out and shoot
into the air once or twice.

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,272
I'll do my part in
my office.

154
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,638
I suggest you throw the gun into the sea.

155
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,593
You will be
completely out of danger...

156
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,268
...and I'll pay you 10 thousand dollars.

157
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,754
10,000 dollars?

158
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,110
Why don't you get your
business with it?

159
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,871
Sam, when you need half a million,
10,000 dollars is a trifle!

160
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,718
But that would be a lot of money for you.

161
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,114
No, Mr. Jarvis.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,035
That money...

163
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,235
... it wouldn't do me any good.

164
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,591
You have to help me!
I can't trust anyone else!

165
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,231
I'll call you when
time.

166
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,113
I'll ask you for a report
of the ransom account.

167
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,276
The rescue account,
this will be the password.

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,835
When you hear that,
come and take care of everything.

169
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,674
I can't do that!

170
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,669
You shouldn't think about something like that.

171
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,314
Suicide is bad.
It doesn't solve anything!

172
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,158
I won't take part in it.

173
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,914
Okay, Sam.

174
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,199
I know that's your attitude,
I understand. Forget it!

175
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,915
Is that you, Sam?

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,075
Yes, dear.

177
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,953
Tonight is the
meeting at the church.

178
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,151
The girls will be here soon.

179
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,673
Sam, did you drink?

180
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,349
It's just that Mr. Jarvis...

181
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,109
Drinks with the boss!
You celebrated!

182
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,113
You got the raise!

183
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,954
Not exactly.

184
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,391
But he said there would be changes
that would affect.

185
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,875
A promotion! Even better!

186
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,231
You see? I was sure that
would be valued!

187
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,113
I wish I could stay
with you and celebrate!

188
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,311
Tell me all about it when I get back!

189
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,595
They're already there.

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,598
Your dinner's on the table.
You don't mind, dear?

191
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,835
Of course not.

192
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,952
I'll take these flowers to the altar,
are they pretty?

193
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,275
Did the kids have dinner?

194
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,436
They're with Freddy, watching
television.

195
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,553
George the Great,
fights El Monstro.

196
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,593
Don't worry, I'll be back as soon as I can,
I'll be back as soon as I can.

197
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,189
Goodbye, darling.

198
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,355
Goodbye, darling.

199
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,395
Hello?

200
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,035
Yes, I'm Sam.

201
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,435
Yes, Sam.

202
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,192
It's sooner than I thought,
but that's it.

203
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,992
Everything is ready here.

204
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,840
"I want a report
of the haggling account".

205
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,112
- But...
- From the ransom account, you know?

206
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,151
You mustn't, I told you!

207
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,475
"To the rescue, Sam."

208
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,352
Mr. Jarvis, don't do this!

209
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,515
Please wait!

210
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,994
I'll go and we'll talk!

211
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,836
Wait for it to arrive!

212
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,755
Hello?

213
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,915
Hello!

214
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,075
Hello!

215
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,635
the happiness of my loved ones
IS IN YOUR HANDS. DON'T LET ME DOWN

216
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,590
SPORTS PORT
SPORT FISHING BOATS

217
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,399
BEERS
DANCE

218
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,515
Georgia?

219
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,675
Roddy!

220
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,153
- Good night, Sam!
- Good night, Bill!

221
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,672
- Is it still up?
- Yes.

222
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,711
- Have the kids arrived yet?
- Not yet.

223
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,718
- Did everything go well?
- Yes, it was great!

224
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,356
It was Mrs. Beamish and Sally.
I hadn't seen them for ages!

225
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,072
The bad thing is that I always
feel guilty!

226
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,235
Guilty?

227
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,555
And ashamed.

228
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,038
Of complaining about our little problems
when I hear real problems.

229
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,800
Tonight we're talking about the Parker family.

230
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,276
Sam, this woman keeps
two children at school...

231
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,268
...and her husband in the sanatorium with the
he earns cleaning!

232
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,675
Yes?

233
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,269
Yes, things could go
worse for us.

234
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,313
We have so much
to be grateful for...

235
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,873
A beautiful home...

236
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,594
...our children and us!

237
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,194
People like us should
give thanks every day.

238
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,315
Are you happy?

239
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,559
- Of course, he's very happy!
- But you're tired. Go to bed!

240
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,195
I'll go where Freddy is
to see the children.

241
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,958
All right, darling!

242
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,398
Mom, the newspaper!
I'm coming!

243
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,989
Go soon or you'll be late!

244
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,839
-Sam!
-Yes?

245
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,031
- Sam, come here!
- Good morning, darling.

246
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,195
I slept a lot!

247
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,755
And terrible, Sam!
They murdered Mr. Jarvis!

248
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,234
- Shot?
- Last night!

249
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,274
He was found in the library
and the police were called!

250
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,712
"Malcolm Jarvis was gunned down
in his Beverly Hills home...

251
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,036
by an unknown gunman".

252
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,437
"The motive is theft,
because there were papers all over the floor...

253
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,995
...and they had opened the safe".

254
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,192
Mrs. Jarvis was in her
beach house.

255
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,755
How awful!

256
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,915
And Sidney!

257
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,355
It's terrible.

258
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,435
Terrible.

259
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,835
Sam,

260
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,954
...we should go and see
Mrs. Jarvis.

261
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,435
Going to see her?

262
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,797
Georgia, I only worked for him!

263
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,069
We're not friends.

264
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,669
But you worked for him for 12 years!

265
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,792
And it's possible that we can
do something for her!

266
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,518
I suppose we could go,

267
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,951
...but I wouldn't feel comfortable
showing up at a time like this!

268
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,118
Jarvis was an important man.
We would be late for church.

269
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,470
There must be something we can
do.

270
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,716
I'll get dressed.
Drink your coffee.

271
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,997
- There will be police everywhere.
- We can offer them help!

272
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,155
That...

273
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,555
...what can I do to help them?

274
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,036
They will question everyone who
knew Mr. Jarvis,

275
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,596
...friends and work colleagues.
Don't they always?

276
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,673
Ask if anyone knows
enemies of the murdered man...

277
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,758
...or if someone was reprimanded
by him, things like that.

278
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,791
It's a case of theft, period.

279
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,672
At least the newspapers said
that.

280
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,952
They'll still ask questions.
That's for sure.

281
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,319
Did you want to see someone?

282
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,833
Yes, officer. My name is
is Wilson, Sam Wilson.

283
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,713
He was one of
of Mr. Jarvis.

284
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,593
My wife and I wanted to see
Mrs. Jarvis

285
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,074
...and see if we can help her.

286
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,079
I'll ask Lieutenant Webb.

287
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,840
He's in charge of the case,
according to the newspapers.

288
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,793
- You have a good reputation!
- Yes, I heard that.

289
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,831
Since Mr. Jarvis
so important,

290
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,669
...will leave no stone unturned until
they find the killer.

291
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,394
Lieutenant Webb said
that you can see Mrs. Jarvis.

292
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,989
And he wants to talk to you,
Mr. Wilson.

293
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,158
Hello, Mrs. Wilson, Mr. Wilson.
Would you like to come in?

294
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,635
Sidney,

295
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,993
...we're sorry about your father.

296
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,558
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.

297
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,551
My mother sent the
to the beach house yesterday.

298
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,274
She also went last night.

299
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,596
Yes, we read that in the paper.

300
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,435
Are you here?

301
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,757
I'll tell her you're here.

302
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,157
- Mr. Hearne!
- How are you, Mr. Wilson?

303
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,433
- How's it going? Have you discovered anything?
- I'm afraid not yet.

304
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,595
It's terrible.

305
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,995
Mrs. Jarvis
is doing very well.

306
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,155
I'm glad!

307
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,319
I was telling the lieutenant that
we weren't very good friends.

308
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,988
He'll think I killed him,
I don't know why.

309
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,430
If it were for control of the
company,

310
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,119
... you already know how little you're worth.

311
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,796
The case is that you have to
find the killer.

312
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,115
It's your job.

313
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,799
Suspect you?
It's incredible!

314
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,069
Of course not.

315
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,351
He gave me a good reprimand.

316
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,790
I'm off.
See you tomorrow, Sam.

317
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,470
I told Mrs. Jarvis
that I'll be running the office at the moment.

318
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,875
I'm glad to see you, ma'am.
Goodbye, ma'am.

319
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,117
Now go downstairs.
Do you want to wait in the living room?

320
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,518
- Good morning, sir.
- Mrs. Jarvis.

321
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,995
- How are you, Mrs. Wilson?
- How are you, Mrs. Wilson?

322
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,392
Thank you so much for coming.

323
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,832
Mrs. Jarvis, we know that no one
can know what you feel,

324
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,429
...but if there's anything we can
do...

325
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,914
Thanks, but...

326
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,350
...I think everything is under control.

327
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,515
Sit down.

328
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,517
Is there anything
with business arrangements?

329
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,755
Thank you, Sam.

330
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,996
We can't plan anything.

331
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,196
They should do an investigation,

332
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,550
...but someone has to
take the office forward.

333
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,275
Mr. Hearne offered to
temporarily.

334
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,597
Frankly, I'd feel better
if you took care of it.

335
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,236
I would be happy to do whatever
was in my hands.

336
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,556
I have complete confidence
in Mr. Hearne.

337
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,676
I wish I could believe it,
but I don't.

338
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,635
Yes?

339
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,230
Lieutenant Webb wants to see
Mr. Wilson in the library.

340
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,555
I'm off. Excuse me.

341
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,508
Sam, I'll wait for you in the car.

342
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,675
Another thing:

343
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,996
could you get me a
financial report of the company?

344
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,430
Of course. I'll bring it tomorrow.

345
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,595
Thank you.

346
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,073
Come in, Mr. Wilson.

347
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,030
- I'm Lieutenant Webb.
- How do you do?

348
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,834
My assistant, Sergeant Cord.
Have a seat.

349
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,398
I understand you're an employee
of Mr. Jarvis.

350
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,556
Yes, sir.
Assistant accountant.

351
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,832
- I worked for him for 12 years.
- 12 years!

352
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,429
You must have known the murdered man
very well!

353
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,512
You know if he had enemies,

354
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,954
...already outside your company
or through personal relationships?

355
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,715
I don't believe it.

356
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,759
- I don't think I had any enemies.
- Didn't I?

357
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,996
And Timothy Hearne, his partner?

358
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,668
I couldn't call him an enemy.

359
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,598
They didn't always agree.

360
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,360
Mr. Wilson, be frank
with Jarvis and Hearne.

361
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,312
We'll find out eventually...

362
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,875
...and nobody goes to the
chamber.

363
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,559
I questioned Hearne.

364
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,433
It's not that there was much love
between them.

365
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,757
Mr. Hearne couldn't kill
Mr. Jarvis. He wouldn't kill anyone!

366
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,350
- No one is accusing him of murder yet!
- What did you discuss?

367
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,830
I believe that Mr. Hearne
wanted to run the company,

368
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,600
...make it more efficient,
profitable.

369
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,473
- The company was making losses.
- Losses?

370
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,997
That's not what Mrs. Jarvis
told me!

371
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,509
He said the business was very
profitable.

372
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,319
The company has lost 50,000 dollars
a year for the last four and a half years.

373
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,639
50,000 dollars,
these are major losses!

374
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,788
About 225,000 dollars,
today.

375
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,598
I'm sure that Mr. Hearne
is not a murderer!

376
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,597
That's great, you're sure!

377
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,955
Not me.

378
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,159
Hearne was alone at
last night.

379
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,715
He could have come and shot
Jarvis.

380
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,595
He admits to having a .38 revolver.
I sent a man after him.

381
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,590
I hadn't...

382
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,793
The autopsy report
reveals that he was shot with a 38...

383
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,118
...and we recovered two projectiles
in the bedroom wall.

384
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,398
Oh, yes, Mr. Wilson.

385
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,915
Right there.

386
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,270
What's up, Mr. Wilson?
that you knew exactly where to aim?

387
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,511
The newspapers said that
thrown out of the window.

388
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,359
Look for the holes in the
on the opposite wall!

389
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,909
Do you think there's something
tell us and help us?

390
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,759
Anything, not the press.

391
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,234
No, sir. Not a thing.

392
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,396
That's all, Mr. Wilson.

393
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,794
For now.

394
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,519
I'd like you to give us your
fingerprints, if you don't mind.

395
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,755
The fingerprints?

396
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,111
Yes. It won't hurt you.
They'll take it at the entrance!

397
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,353
Well, buddy.
Don't be shy, come with that hand.

398
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,348
Why would he be so nervous?

399
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,674
I wonder how I knew
the bullets were in that wall!

400
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,835
I don't know!

401
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,749
You won't believe that this
bunny killed anyone, do you?

402
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,995
Let them follow him.

403
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,152
Follow him? Are you kidding?

404
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,839
I said follow him.

405
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,955
Okay.

406
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,875
The phone is on the table.

407
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,594
Hey, Mom, Dad!

408
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,792
Do you know about Mr. Jarvis?
Have you read the papers? Have you been to church?

409
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,912
We didn't go to church,
we went to see Mrs. Jarvis.

410
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,075
Oh!

411
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,239
- It must be tough for her and Sidney!
- Yes, dear.

412
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,829
- Were there police?
- Yes, they were there.

413
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,159
- I spoke to Lieutenant Webb.
- Lieutenant Webb!

414
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,190
How exciting!

415
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,593
Do you know you were in the war?

416
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,837
He was behind the German lines.
He was wounded in the leg too.

417
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,871
Yes, he's certainly
a good man.

418
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,072
Look! It's like a modern
policeman!

419
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,352
Always get the bad guy!
He was also in T2.

420
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,312
Military intelligence, Dad.

421
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,272
Hey, get back to your soccer!

422
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,676
Mom, do you prefer Dick Powell
or Cary Grant?

423
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,909
Ask your father.
He wouldn't let me have any!

424
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,390
I swapped Cary Grant
for Dick Powell...

425
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,272
...at a wedding with Jane Greer.

426
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,038
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

427
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,992
I prefer Donald Duck.

428
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,235
Wait, Dad.

429
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,354
Oh. I'll give you the
section.

430
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,393
I don't care!
I'm reading about the murder.

431
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,797
Roddy, don't read that stuff!
It's morbid!

432
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,115
It's sensational!

433
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,517
I'm going to be a detective,
like Lieutenant Webb.

434
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,269
They say the police are after
the criminal's trail!

435
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,309
They know that, but he doesn't!

436
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,558
He knows
what they want you to know.

437
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,832
Sometimes they put lies
in the newspapers...

438
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,349
...to give him false clues.
- Roddy!

439
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,313
Surely Lieutenant Webb
has enough...

440
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,080
...to send him to the gas chamber!

441
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,915
Roddy!

442
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,917
I didn't know you were an expert
on police and crime!

443
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,475
It's because he reads detective stories.

444
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,513
If they let him,
he would catch the killer immediately,

445
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,119
...isn't that right, Roddy?

446
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,235
I'm going!

447
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,195
Hello, Sidney.

448
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,356
- Hello, is your father there?
-Yes!

449
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,039
It's Sidney Jarvis!

450
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,075
Sidney.

451
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,035
Tell him to come in!

452
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,075
Come in!

453
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,193
Sidney,
we're sorry about your father!

454
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,755
- Thank you, Roddy.
- Hello, Sidney.

455
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,952
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Wilson.
- Good afternoon, Sidney. Have a seat.

456
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,434
- Take this chair.
- Thank you.

457
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,475
Mr. Wilson, I want to talk to you...

458
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,638
in private,
to ask his advice.

459
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,235
Roddy, Hilda, upstairs!

460
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,112
Get ready for bed.

461
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,799
See you later, Sidney.

462
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,515
I...

463
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,551
You can talk to Mrs. Wilson.
She'll understand.

464
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,030
What is it, Sidney?

465
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,916
Mr. Wilson, my father loved
of you. That's why I'm here.

466
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,395
Thank you.

467
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,235
Also because you know
Mr. Hearne.

468
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,512
Dad didn't like him
and Mom thinks he's a thief...

469
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,110
...but I believe I know him and I don't
agree. What do you think?

470
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,753
I like him.

471
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,350
He didn't get on well with his father, but
I'm sure he's honest.

472
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,875
Me too!

473
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,032
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

474
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,753
You see, I saw Mr. Hearne
at our house last night.

475
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,394
Did you see Mr. Hearne
house last night?

476
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,398
He doesn't know I saw him,
but I did.

477
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,116
I had a date with Joan Martin.

478
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,880
When I left his house, I saw that I had
forgotten my wallet...

479
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,354
...and I went back to get it.

480
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,075
I didn't go to the entrance.
I left the car to one side and went upstairs.

481
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,318
When I came back, I saw Dad
and Mr. Hearne in the library.

482
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,192
Are you sure it was him?

483
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,836
Yes! I had a good look!
They were arguing and didn't see me.

484
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,473
What time was it, Sidney?

485
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,394
It should be half past eight,
not earlier.

486
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,477
Then we went to Joan's house.

487
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,912
Dad and Mr. Hearne
were home alone.

488
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,955
I went to dinner with Joan...

489
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,878
...and when I came back,

490
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,872
...I found him on the ground and called the
the police.

491
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,400
Did you tell them that
Hearne had been there?

492
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,273
They didn't ask, so
I didn't say.

493
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,314
I want them to catch Dad's killer
and I want to help the police,

494
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,115
...but I don't want to get an
in trouble.

495
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,799
I agree with you, Sidney.
It wouldn't look good...

496
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,594
...implicate an innocent man.
- Sam!

497
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,755
No, Sidney.

498
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,916
Don't say anything to Webb.

499
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,110
That's what I felt I had to do.
I'm glad you agree.

500
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,038
That's what Dad would have said,

501
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,959
...even if he and Hearne
didn't get along.

502
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,029
Thank you very much,
I'll take your advice.

503
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,352
I think I should go home,
I shouldn't leave my mother alone.

504
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,391
- Good evening and thank you very much.
- Good night, Sidney.

505
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,353
Sidney, I'm sure
you're doing the right thing.

506
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,190
- Good evening, Mr. Wilson.
- Good night, Mr. Wilson.

507
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,591
He's a good kid, isn't he?

508
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,836
Sam, I don't understand your attitude.

509
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,629
Darling, we usually agree
on almost everything,

510
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,070
...but I think you're
wrong about this!

511
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,193
The police must have
all possible information about the case...

512
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,951
...and that Mr. Hearne had gone last
night is very important.

513
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,798
And I don't think so,

514
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,436
...so I'm going to insist, Georgia,
forget about it.

515
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,798
It's not a question of implicating
Mr. Hearne.

516
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,468
Isn't it possible that you killed
Mr. Jarvis?

517
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,035
No, it's not possible,
I'm sure of it.

518
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,719
Sam, what's wrong with you?

519
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,674
It doesn't behave normally.
How can you be so sure?

520
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,110
Well, I know Mr. Hearne.

521
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,271
He behaves as if he knew
who it was. Do you?

522
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,877
What a silly question!
How can anyone know?

523
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,113
- Well... - Georgia, I don't want to
discuss this any further!

524
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,917
- What's your address?
- I don't know it.

525
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,235
Ms. Vantay!

526
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,195
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

527
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,358
Here it is.
I didn't know if you were coming today!

528
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,630
Mr. Hearne
called a meeting.

529
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,795
They're waiting for you.

530
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,518
We'll talk about that in a moment.

531
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,596
- Oh, good morning, Sam.
- Good morning, sir.

532
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,916
- They're all there, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

533
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,236
I suppose many
wondering what's going to happen.

534
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,956
As for the immediate future,

535
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,720
...they can continue working,
that is, if they want to.

536
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,551
The company has no funds,

537
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,833
...but I personally will keep it
out of my pocket for three months,

538
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,032
...so don't be afraid,
they won't be on the street.

539
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,549
A delegation of
from the police.

540
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,637
It should be here soon.

541
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,115
They want to ask questions...

542
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,436
...and, of course, we must help them.

543
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,198
Well, that's all.

544
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,514
Just a minute, Sam.

545
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,915
Sit down!

546
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,274
Sam, I plan to put my
hands in the company.

547
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,109
That is, if you can make a
reasonable deal with Mrs. Jarvis.

548
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,874
That's great!
I'm sure you can do it, sir.

549
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,035
Thank you.

550
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,037
Where am I going with this?

551
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,515
Austin was fired
as head of accounts.

552
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,199
It takes months of discontent.

553
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,198
He knows about our situation and
another job.

554
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,958
He just told me.

555
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,994
- If you want his seat, it's yours.
- Austin's seat?

556
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,155
That's right.

557
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,513
I can't guarantee that it will be
permanent.

558
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,070
You pay 500 dollars a month...

559
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,794
...and I'd like you to stay.

560
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,115
Work hard.

561
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,274
What's most important:
he's honest and loyal.

562
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,833
Well, what do you say?

563
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,156
Mr. Hearne, you're very kind.

564
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,838
Yes, of course I will.

565
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,396
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- From now on you're the chief accountant.

566
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,160
I asked him to leave soon,
so he could start.

567
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,954
We'll meet when
the investigation is finished...

568
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,993
...and we'll discuss it in more detail.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,397
Roddy, what the hell are you looking for?

570
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,956
My baseball cap!
It's got to be somewhere!

571
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,277
Don't clutter up the closet
any more than it already is!

572
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,994
It seems to me that he's always
looking for him!

573
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,794
I'm looking because I can't find it!

574
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,036
Once I find him,
I'll stop looking for him!

575
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,151
Nobody uses it but you!

576
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,396
I'm not so sure about that!

577
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,592
It's funny how easy it is to
to lose a baseball cap!

578
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,553
I have a very important game today!

579
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,957
I can't...
Wow! I've found it!

580
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,753
Roddy, what have you done?

581
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,475
Did you hurt yourself?

582
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,954
No, I don't think so.

583
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,230
I'll take that.

584
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,317
No, no. Go on, get out!

585
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,394
I had to clean it anyway.

586
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,556
- Let's get to it.
- Be careful when you go down into the archives.

587
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,392
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mr. Hearne.

588
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,910
Sorry to disturb you, we won't make
more noise than necessary.

589
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,075
Thank you.

590
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,395
Lieutenant Webb, from the police.

591
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,558
You are in charge of the investigation
into the death of Mr. Jarvis.

592
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,352
I know they'll help you
you can.

593
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,949
To begin with, we want
your fingerprints.

594
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,958
Don't be alarmed,
it's a routine procedure.

595
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,709
We want to search
Jarvis' office and his files.

596
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,875
This way.

597
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,715
Well, friends.

598
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,914
I already have your fingerprints from yesterday.
Miss, if you want to come this way...

599
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,637
I had nothing to do
with Mr. Jarvis' death!

600
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,389
The police don't think
We just want your fingerprints.

601
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,313
If you don't mind.

602
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,074
Yes, I argued with Jarvis,
several times.

603
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,271
I didn't like him
personally...

604
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,913
...but that doesn't mean
that I killed him.

605
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,477
You wouldn't see Mr. Jarvis at his
Saturday night, would you?

606
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,030
Why, when I can see him
whenever I want at the office?

607
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,518
So the lieutenant
asks him why.

608
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,109
And I tell you
you had no reason to!

609
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,629
- Is that the last thing you have to say?
- Yes, it is.

610
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,400
- That's all right. That's all for now.
- Thank you very much.

611
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,357
I wonder what he's hiding.

612
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,596
That's the question of the million!

613
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,952
- And Jarvis' secretary?
- Miss Altanera?

614
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,156
I checked her out.
She was the boss's fiancée.

615
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,591
For Saturday night
you seem to have a good alibi.

616
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,268
She would be the first secretary
to get involved with a boss...

617
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,550
...whose devotion was so firm.

618
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,879
Hello? Yes!

619
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,118
Hello, Mac. I'm Webb.

620
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,555
Anything else?

621
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,878
Intriguing. Thank you, sir.

622
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,152
The bullet that killed Jarvis...

623
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,035
...it wasn't the same gun
that hit the wall.

624
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,675
That means they used
two weapons.

625
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,033
Maybe the secretary had
two revolvers.

626
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,310
Yes, or maybe there was a duel.

627
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,559
I only have one thing clear:

628
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,275
the murder was not
of a common thief.

629
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,475
Jarvis could have killed himself.

630
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,148
And get rid of both
weapons afterwards?

631
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,790
It's a good trick.
You can do it.

632
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,038
Frank, have you found anything?

633
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,312
They were right about the
financial situation.

634
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,715
They were on their last legs.

635
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,275
Debts of at least
250,000 dollars.

636
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,118
What about Jarvis' personal fortune?

637
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,595
None of that, it was broken.

638
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,837
Even his house
was mortgaged.

639
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,154
It looks like the typical
of suicide.

640
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,315
Yes.

641
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,636
Just a moment, Frank.
Tell Ms. Vantay to come here.

642
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,555
Ms. Vantay!

643
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,958
Close the door, will you?

644
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,114
Ms. Vantay, you know
that Mr. Jarvis had insurance.

645
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,355
Well...

646
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,073
...yes, I think I did!

647
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,433
Do you think so or did you?
Wasn't she your personal secretary?

648
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,435
Yes.

649
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,234
- Yes, I had insurance.
- With which company?

650
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,078
With Standard Life.

651
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,953
- I see, for how much?
- I don't know.

652
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,314
Why does the company know
not how much?

653
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,514
He only handled correspondence
relating to the policy,

654
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,039
not the policy itself.

655
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,435
Oh. Would Mr. Wilson know?

656
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,835
I doubt it.

657
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,191
You don't have that much responsibility!

658
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,475
I see.

659
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,112
And as for Mr. Wilson,

660
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,995
...they said they fired him
on the morning of the murder?

661
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,715
No.

662
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,239
Nobody mentioned it.

663
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,754
Thank you very much.

664
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,350
Ms. Vantay,
can you give me the phone number?

665
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,995
The insurance company.

666
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,155
Yes, sir.

667
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,317
Now we're getting
somewhere.

668
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,996
I thought you were going to ask
love life!

669
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,595
Yes!

670
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,519
Oh, I'm Lieutenant Webb,
from the police department.

671
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,840
I want information about a policy
in the name of Malcolm Jarvis.

672
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,115
Thank you.

673
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,437
She also thought he would ask
about her love life.

674
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,076
I'll do it, but I want to give you time
to come up with the answers.

675
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,235
Yes?

676
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,113
Malcolm Jarvis, that's it.

677
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,715
How much?

678
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,275
When?

679
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,595
Yes!

680
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,032
That's exactly
what you wanted to know.

681
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,514
Thank you very much!

682
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,595
What's next?

683
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,997
We're going to the house
and Wilson will come with us.

684
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,673
For a walk!

685
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,716
Sergeant,
I'm trying to shed some light on this case.

686
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,315
That's funny.

687
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,192
It's like a
defective...

688
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,790
...where the image inside
is not like the one on the box.

689
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,274
What do you mean, boss?

690
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,358
- To begin with, it wasn't theft.
- You don't believe me...

691
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,994
That Jarvis prepared
death?

692
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,795
That he hired someone to settle it
and so your family would collect?

693
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,435
Possibly.

694
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,598
There was very recently
a case in Kansas...

695
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,189
...in which one man paid another
to kill him...

696
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,551
...because his business was going very badly.
- Oh yes!

697
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,957
Of course, it's still
murder,

698
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,995
...and even if he did commit suicide
who would help him prepare for it...

699
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,158
would be an accomplice to crime:
hiding evidence.

700
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,315
That's right!

701
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,677
Are you coming with me, Mr. Wilson?

702
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,679
Wait here, Sergeant.

703
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,076
Oh, excuse me a moment.

704
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,835
Look at him.

705
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,073
I want to make him a little
nervous.

706
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,630
I'm sure there's something on his mind,
but I don't know what it is.

707
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,955
Peter Rabbit?

708
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,355
He's worried about getting home
with Mrs. Rabbit.

709
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,073
No, it's more than that.

710
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,874
If you get even more nervous
I might let something out.

711
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,957
If you get any more nervous, you'll explode!

712
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,513
Don't take your eye off him.

713
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,793
Well, Mr. Wilson.

714
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,994
Come in, Lieutenant.

715
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,875
Hello, sir.

716
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,356
Mrs. Jarvis, I'm sorry to disturb you
at a time like this,

717
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,120
...but something new happened
this morning.

718
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,878
Sit down, Lieutenant.

719
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,830
Mrs. Jarvis, what about the insurance?

720
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,029
Life insurance.

721
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,310
Do you know how much your husband
was insured for?

722
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,951
For about 50,000 dollars.

723
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,959
50,000 dollars? Is that all?

724
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,115
Yes.

725
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,994
Yes, as far as I know!

726
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,997
- Why?
- Do you know when you took out the insurance?

727
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,108
A long time ago.

728
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,754
Several years, I think.

729
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,476
Mrs. Jarvis, her husband
was insured for 250,000 dollars.

730
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,594
250.000?

731
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,436
Yes, 200,000 three months ago.

732
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,995
Lieutenant,

733
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,556
...if you mean that my father
killed himself for the insurance,

734
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,193
...bark on the wrong tree.

735
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,233
It's the insurance company that barks, not me!

736
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,150
If he was murdered, they will have to pay.

737
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,876
But if it was suicide, no.

738
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,355
They would save a few
thousands.

739
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,118
Dad wouldn't kill himself!

740
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,755
No?

741
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,672
I don't believe it either.

742
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,191
Finally, we're going.

743
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,075
Oh, another thing, Mrs. Jarvis.
Has Mr. Hearne been here?

744
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,159
Mr. Hearne hasn't
house for six months.

745
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,271
Six months? I see.

746
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,915
Well, thank you.

747
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,358
Goodbye, Mrs. Jarvis.

748
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,712
And now we're going to see Mr. Hearne
again.

749
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,070
- Mr. Hearne?
- He'll have left the office.

750
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,714
I forgot to tell you that:
he left the office.

751
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,036
I had him taken to the police station.

752
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,676
Now bring in Mr. Hearne.
Have a seat.

753
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,476
The Dawson case is closed.

754
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,636
- How much did you get?
- Twenty years.

755
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,470
- Lieutenant, do you think it's necessary
here when you question Hearne?

756
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,830
I told him what I know about the case.

757
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,077
I just want you to be here,
Mr. Wilson.

758
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,796
On the subject of investigations...

759
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,591
...the point is to contrast.

760
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,918
Contrasting one statement
with another, that's what it's all about.

761
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,395
Yes, and when something doesn't fit,

762
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,749
...someone is lying.

763
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,635
Then it would seem that Mr. Wilson
is not telling the truth.

764
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,752
Is it possible to have a pen
that writes?

765
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,915
Yes, boss.

766
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,513
Here, use mine.

767
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,638
The sergeant says...

768
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,673
...that when we meet someone
who has lied,

769
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,156
...the next step is to find out
why he lies!

770
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,113
So we got very close
to our man.

771
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,918
I want to know what this means!

772
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,236
If I'm under arrest,
I want to call my lawyer!

773
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,399
Arrested? He's no more trapped than
Mr. Wilson here.

774
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,830
I just told Hogan
to ask him to come.

775
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,915
It's a very persistent invitation.

776
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,236
Now that you've come, sit down.

777
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,992
He said to Mr. Wilson.

778
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,714
...that when we catch
someone lying...

779
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,152
...and we found out why,
you get very close to the solution.

780
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,832
Why do you think I'm lying?

781
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,112
He said he wasn't at Jarvis' house
on the night of his death.

782
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,755
He said he had no reason to go,
I could see him in the office.

783
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,030
But you were there, Mr. Hearne.

784
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,710
He left his fingerprints on the door
among other places.

785
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,558
Yes, yes, I was there.

786
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,878
- What unites you with Mrs. Jarvis?
- Mrs. Jarvis?

787
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,559
I didn't ask you!

788
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,797
What you suggest is crazy.
He hated me like poison!

789
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,878
But if it wasn't for Mr. Jarvis,
well, as I said,

790
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,640
...I could see him in the office,
it would be for his wife!

791
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,995
Okay.

792
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,959
I was there that night.

793
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,789
Do you want to sign a declaration or
want to call your lawyer?

794
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,035
Statement?

795
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,555
I didn't kill him!

796
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,676
- I was alive when I left.
- Why were you there?

797
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,429
I made another effort to convince him
to sell.

798
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,555
Why didn't you tell me
that you were there?

799
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,835
I don't know,

800
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,749
...but under the circumstances,
what would you have said?

801
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,915
Maybe not.

802
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,554
Did you ever hear Hearne
threaten to kill Jarvis?

803
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,034
Threaten?
Of course not!

804
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,117
Don't answer without thinking.

805
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,038
Did you know they argued?

806
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,759
Yes, of course, but...

807
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,995
...for business!

808
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,679
Have you heard?

809
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,629
I think so.

810
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,878
When?
The last time, for example!

811
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,876
Well...

812
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,240
...it was last Saturday
morning.

813
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,759
I came in to ask for a raise.

814
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,838
- And they fired him!
- We'll talk about that later.

815
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,670
I want to know what you heard
between Hearne and Jarvis that morning!

816
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,075
I didn't hear anything.

817
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,875
Nothing at all!

818
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,868
Mr. Hearne was leaving
when I heard him say...

819
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,993
...that if Mr. Jarvis didn't want to
reasonably discuss, there was...

820
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,395
Well?

821
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,395
Go ahead, Sam.

822
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,715
He said.

823
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,394
...there were other ways.

824
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,236
- But I'm sure it's not...
- That's enough, Mr. Wilson.

825
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,237
I want to talk to
Mr. Hearne alone.

826
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,675
You can go now.

827
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,475
It's Dad!

828
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,795
Dad!

829
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,029
Hi, Dad!
I wanted to see you!

830
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,196
- So what?
- What happened in the office?

831
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,437
- Have they found the killer?
- I don't think so.

832
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,234
- It was certainly full of policemen!
-Yes.

833
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,395
Hello, darling.

834
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,915
Dinner's ready.
Have a seat.

835
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,280
Lt. Webb
was with us all day.

836
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,153
Lieutenant Webb?
What a guy!

837
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,597
Now that I remember, can you
get me your autograph?

838
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,472
Dick Tracy is the best cop!

839
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,717
- I have your photo and your autograph.
- Movie cops!

840
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,912
Webb is for real!
Have you discovered anything, Dad?

841
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,599
I don't know, I don't think so.

842
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,554
The police think there is a
element in the case.

843
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,753
- It could be a good murder.
- There is no such thing as a good murder, Roddy.

844
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,029
I'm sorry, Dad.

845
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,595
I didn't mean good,
just exciting.

846
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,031
In any case, the newspapers say
that Webb already knows who he is...

847
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,391
...and he's going to throw down the gauntlet
at any moment.

848
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,989
You're giving him rope to
to hang himself.

849
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,236
Roddy, will you shut up?

850
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,996
Lord, we give thanks for the
food that we are going to consume...

851
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,795
...and for the blessings you shower
on our lives.

852
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,955
Amen.

853
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,476
How about some good news
for a change?

854
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,636
Austin left. They gave me his
as Head of Accounts.

855
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,035
Head of Accounts?
Is he the boss?

856
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,118
Yes. Mr. Hearne
plans to continue with the company...

857
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,835
...if you reach an agreement with
Mrs. Jarvis. I think I'll stay.

858
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,112
I wish I had
a Chief Accountant!

859
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,437
You'll see when I tell my friends
that my father is the boss!

860
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,675
I'm proud of you!

861
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,834
- I think your mother does too.
- Yes, Sam, it's wonderful!

862
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,757
In any case,
it will make things easier.

863
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,314
Yes, it's true!

864
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,557
And you did it as if nothing
happened!

865
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,038
Dad, you're very lucky!

866
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,557
Yes, very lucky!

867
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,919
What's the matter, darling?

868
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,439
I'm tired, I guess.

869
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,594
A difficult day.

870
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,752
I have the report prepared
for Mrs. Jarvis.

871
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,992
You should take him.

872
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,715
I'll drive.

873
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,515
Okay.

874
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,038
I'll put on my cape.

875
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,438
Sam, you know how much I love you.

876
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,110
I love you more than anything in the world,
no matter what I do...

877
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,709
...or have done!
You know that, don't you?

878
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,555
Yes, I know.

879
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,876
Why don't you tell me?

880
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,029
- It's an ugly story, Georgia.
- You'd better tell me.

881
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,509
You're afraid they'll arrest Mr. Hearne
for murder, aren't you?

882
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,631
Yes. Maybe they already have.

883
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,718
All that's missing is one word from me
to absolve him.

884
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,399
When I do...

885
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,357
...they're going to arrest me.

886
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,516
No, Sam, not you!

887
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,233
No, dear. He killed himself!

888
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,039
But I knew
and I got rid of the gun.

889
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,798
He paid me 10,000 dollars...

890
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,719
...so that his suicide
look like murder.

891
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,719
I know, I met them this morning.

892
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,117
I didn't want to stay with them.

893
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,756
I know you were going to give them back.

894
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,359
Tell me everything,
just like it happened!

895
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,035
Well...

896
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,159
...Saturday morning,
when I went to ask for a raise...

897
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,793
Go on, darling.

898
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,153
I'll wait here.

899
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,155
Come in, Sam.

900
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,475
Good evening.

901
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,318
I was waiting for you.

902
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,357
I made the report.

903
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,357
Let's go to the library.

904
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,075
- Sit down, Sam.
- No, thank you.

905
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,033
Mrs. Jarvis,
this report may surprise you.

906
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,754
The company has been losing money
for a long time.

907
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,155
I thought it was in that envelope.

908
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,191
This is something else, it's different.

909
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,630
I'm not sure that
wanted to know that.

910
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,796
I'd love to know.

911
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,034
I have something to tell you.

912
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,708
Something that will be a huge blow
for you.

913
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,115
Her husband was not murdered.

914
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,874
I don't understand!

915
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,752
- You didn't murder him?
- No, they didn't.

916
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,879
- He killed himself.
- Killed himself?

917
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,638
That's right, he committed suicide.

918
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,239
Why are you telling me now?

919
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,193
You have the right to know
how much I loved them.

920
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,358
To the point of taking
life.

921
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,518
I planned to give them these
10,000 dollars.

922
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,188
They belong to them.

923
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,877
- Have you told anyone about this?
- Not yet.

924
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,911
I'm going to the police to turn myself in.

925
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,916
I know how hard it is to lose
insurance money,

926
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,429
...but it's the only thing
I can do.

927
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,110
Sam, you're a coward.
A miserable coward!

928
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,796
The police have nothing.

929
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,994
If he'd kept quiet.
I would have won 10,000 dollars.

930
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,599
I knew your business!

931
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,360
Do you think you needed a report
to know it was ruined?

932
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,312
- Did you know?
- Of course you did!

933
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,954
I knew what I was planning
and I was proud!

934
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,434
I wanted to help him.

935
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,837
We sent the staff
to the beach house...

936
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,951
...and I told him I'd come later.

937
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,748
Sidney went out on Saturday nights.
Malcolm would be alone.

938
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,918
- Everything was perfect.
- Did you let him kill himself?

939
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,994
Not exactly.

940
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,194
I said goodbye...

941
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,630
at ten past eight.

942
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,315
At that moment I was convinced,
I saw it in his eyes.

943
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,313
But I knew him well.

944
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,958
As he left, he doubted that
Malcolm was going to kill himself.

945
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,837
That night or any other.

946
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:33,030
And with that doubt in my head,
I couldn't leave. Don't you see?

947
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,276
Everything depended on Malcolm!

948
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,516
And Malcolm was weak!

949
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,157
I couldn't risk it,
I had to be sure.

950
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,589
I heard him talking to you on the phone...

951
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,750
...and waited to hear the shot,

952
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,556
...but there was no shot.

953
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,877
I'd lost my nerve
again.

954
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,710
I had to do what he
didn't have the courage to do.

955
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,158
I think I knew...

956
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:24,239
...when he saw me standing there,
I was going to kill him!

957
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,592
And I remembered to change
the cartridge...

958
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,950
...so that they would think
it was suicide.

959
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,156
It had been suicide,
in a way!

960
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,397
He needed someone
to pull the trigger!

961
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,635
You killed him!

962
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,235
Yes.

963
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,595
Yes, I killed him!

964
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,715
So...

965
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,918
...I can't let you go
to the police.

966
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:16,076
He thinks that, having killed Malcolm
for 250,000 dollars,

967
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,238
...Can I let you ruin everything?
No!

968
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,995
The police won't listen to your story!

969
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,270
You will hear mine and that will be it:

970
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,638
came to my house and confessed
that she killed my husband...

971
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,229
...and stole 10,000 dollars
from his safe,

972
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,512
...and killed him with the same gun
you shot him with!

973
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,675
She's mad!

974
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,074
I'm not crazy!

975
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,437
I'm just a coward like
you and Malcolm!

976
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,792
I've always had money,
rich friends, position!

977
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,594
I can't face the future
without it!

978
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,230
That's why the police will find you
dead, with the gun in your hands!

979
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,835
I'm going to shoot, Sam!

980
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,519
What's in your story?

981
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,915
A man doesn't commit suicide
by shooting himself in the back!

982
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,829
You'll have to manage!

983
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,830
Do you think the police will believe
that I shot myself twice?

984
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,395
He had a shot and he used it!

985
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,797
I'll take care of it, Mrs. Jarvis.

986
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,629
Take her to the car.

987
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,633
It took me a while to get in,
Mr. Wilson.

988
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,958
-She was a bad shot!
- Yes.

989
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,513
Oh, you got it!

990
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,916
- He's lucky, just a scratch.
- Thanks to you, Lieutenant.

991
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,111
- It's part of the job.
- Sam!

992
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,392
Sam! I heard gunshots,
are you okay?

993
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,114
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You'd better see a doctor!

994
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,198
- A doctor? Sam, are you hurt?
- It's nothing.

995
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,676
- Nothing? How do you know?
- Take off your jacket!

996
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,835
Let me see.

997
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,917
Mrs. Jarvis is on her way.

998
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,075
Oh!

999
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,840
And you let me lose
all the blood!

1000
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,828
Why did you have to shoot him?
Don't tell me he was trying to escape!

1001
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,555
I know my husband better than you do.
I was going to face the facts...

1002
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,398
Will you let me talk?

1003
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,068
The lieutenant didn't shoot me.
It was Mrs. Jarvis.

1004
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,714
- She killed Mr. Jarvis.
- Mrs. Jarvis!

1005
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:15,875
That's right!

1006
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,356
We suspected her, but Hearne
wouldn't admit it!

1007
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,956
I can't believe it!
I don't understand,

1008
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,073
...but I have to take you to a doctor.
- You forgot the police.

1009
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,633
Are you under arrest?

1010
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,353
How did they know you were coming?

1011
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,949
We've been following you
since Sunday

1012
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,513
You didn't know that, did you?

1013
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,439
I'm glad that Mr. Hearne
is also acquitted.

1014
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,474
And as for Jarvis' insurance,
they'll pay because it wasn't suicide.

1015
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,070
Mrs. Jarvis won't see anything, of course.

1016
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,078
The law does not allow a criminal to
profit from a crime.

1017
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,157
Everything will go to your child.

1018
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,634
I'm happy about that.

1019
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,308
He said that Mr. Hearne
is also acquitted.

1020
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,999
- You mean Sam...
- Yes!

1021
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,714
- Take him away, Mrs. Wilson.
- Aren't you going to arrest me?

1022
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,875
Why?

1023
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,116
If Jarvis had killed himself,
he would have been implicated.

1024
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,675
But it wasn't like that.
So much so that he's innocent!

1025
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,995
But I got involved...

1026
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,873
You won't be accused of anything,
Mr. Wilson.

1027
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,277
And I think it's been
bad enough.

1028
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,153
Take care of this, Sergeant.

01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,957

1031
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,559

01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,595
