1
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:34,155
How am I going to hold this pose
if you make cracks like that?

2
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,633
You ought to see the
crack I've made in you.

3
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:39,636
Then how about my taking a look?
- Nothing doing.

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,629
You can admire yourself later.

5
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,085
I wanted to see if you had
carved your initials in me.

6
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:46,538
I should have given you
a general anaesthetic.

7
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,490
I didn't think you'd mind a little
thing like an appendectomy ..

8
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,378
After all the crack-ups
you've been through.

9
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,498
What do you mean "all the crack-ups"?

10
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:59,137
I haven't had a crack-up since you froze
the controls as I taught you how to fly.

11
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:02,065
How do you want this,
hem-stitched or buttonholed?

12
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:03,938
No zippers?

13
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,326
What kind of a hospital is this?

14
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:07,650
You know.

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,988
I had a yen once to become a doctor.

16
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:13,039
All I can repair is an aeroplane motor.

17
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,457
You can repair people.

18
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,500
You've built up a great name, Jim.

19
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,897
I think the patient
is getting delirious.

20
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:22,622
I guess I am.

21
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,837
Well, that is a neat piece of
embroidery if I do say so myself.

22
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:30,215
Now take good care
of this guy, will you.

23
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,363
No matter how much he hollers.

24
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:33,767
Don't feed him steaks.

25
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:35,402
Yes, Dr Stanton.

26
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,264
[ Door knocks ]

27
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:47,264
Come in.

28
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:51,782
Barbara!

29
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:54,987
Well, it is about time you gave
your lord and master a break.

30
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,514
Hey.

31
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:58,298
Wait a minute.

32
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,274
I am your bride-to-be.

33
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,427
But don't forget there
is still a "to be".

34
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:03,399
Overwhelmed.

35
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,495
Not bad for an overworked doctor.

36
00:03:06,078 --> 00:03:07,179
Time out for repairs.

37
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,798
Beautiful.
- Of course.

38
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:11,903
What are you doing in the big city?
- Shopping.

39
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,210
Getting a trousseau for our benefit.

40
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:15,666
Say, I'm a wreck.

41
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,943
If you're ready to leave
I'll drive you home.

42
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:20,476
Oh, I'm sorry. I've got too much
work to do here. I can't make it.

43
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,072
Well, I guess if I'm going to be a
doctor's wife I must get used to it.

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,033
Don't rush off.
We've got time for a cigarette.

45
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,265
I got a surprise for you.

46
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:32,830
I was talking to the contractor today.

47
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:36,625
And he tells me we can move
into the new house by the 1st.

48
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,533
That is if we can make up our
mind about that dining room.

49
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,617
Come in.

50
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,492
There is a Mr Grey
to see you, Dr Stanton.

51
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:45,566
Grey?

52
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:47,318
Well, show him in.

53
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:48,874
Out, wench.

54
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,489
He might be a spy from
the Junior League.

55
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:03,383
Dr Stanton?
- Yes.

56
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,771
I'm inspector Grey from the
Department of Commerce.

57
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:06,734
Oh yes?

58
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,517
A complaint has been made
against you for reckless flying.

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,261
Reckless flying?

60
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:14,073
Haven't you made some mistake?
- No chance of that.

61
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:16,829
The complaining party gave
us the number of your plane.

62
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:19,405
You've been charged with
diving at a residence.

63
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:20,822
Why that is absurd.

64
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,901
I fly a lot but I've never
dived at any houses.

65
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,559
I value my neck too much for that.

66
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:28,986
Who made the charge?

67
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:29,979
Well.

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,162
The complaint was made by
your father, Dr Stanton Senior.

69
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:34,758
Ah.

70
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:37,240
So father is playing tattle-tail again.

71
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,750
If there's any more of this stunting ..

72
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:41,830
Your transport licence
will be cancelled.

73
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:45,148
Hello?

74
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:47,684
See if you can get me my father.

75
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,094
Yeah. I think he is in Ward B.

76
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:51,879
Thanks.

77
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:56,869
Alright, Barbara. He has gone.

78
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,800
What is the matter with you?

79
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,873
You look as if your inkwell bit you.
- It's worse than that.

80
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,802
Dad has turned informer.

81
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:08,015
He called the Department of
Commerce to stop me from flying.

82
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:09,981
I think that is a swell idea.

83
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:14,667
I'm doing my work here. Why would anyone
care what I do outside the hospital?

84
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:17,194
You can't seem to realize who you are.

85
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:18,908
You are a Stanton.

86
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,414
The fifth in a long line
of illustrious doctors.

87
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:22,428
Yeah.

88
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:25,958
If you keep on flying you are liable to
break your neck and your father's heart.

89
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:29,603
Should I travel on a horse just
because the first Dr Stanton did?

90
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,045
Don't take it so seriously, darling.
- It is serious.

91
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:35,037
And I won't stand for interference.

92
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:38,103
If I don't get started I'll
be caught in the traffic jam.

93
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:41,373
Hello, Dr Stanton.

94
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,320
Don't let me drive you away, my dear.

95
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:44,671
I really must be going.

96
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,589
Remember your best
bedside manners, dear.

97
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:48,880
Alright, darling.

98
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,747
Dad, a Department of Commerce
inspector was just here.

99
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,547
Did he beat any sense into your head?

100
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,270
Don't you think it is just about time
you let me handle my own affairs?

101
00:05:57,676 --> 00:05:59,798
I'm out of rompers you know.
- Mentally, you are not.

102
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:02,455
We've been through this before.

103
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,629
Yes, and we are going into
it again. Once and for all.

104
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,014
I like to fly and I am going to fly.

105
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:08,773
Flying is only a part of it, Jim.

106
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:10,628
You are running around too much.

107
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:13,216
It's time you got over
this youthful exuberance.

108
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:14,666
You are a doctor now.

109
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,078
Besides, you have got
Barbara to think about.

110
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:20,616
I know it, Dad. I love Barbara. I'd not
do anything in the world to hurt her.

111
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,275
Dad, I am trying to make myself
as great a surgeon as you and ..

112
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,490
Grandfather, great grandfather and
all the rest of the Stantons but if I ..

113
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,522
Jim.

114
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:32,536
I am going to keep after you and
the Department of Commerce.

115
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,369
Until you learn to
<i>behave</i> like a Stanton.

116
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,927
If I want to have a
little fun on the side.

117
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,417
Or relaxation it's nobody's
business but my own.

118
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,120
I've got an appointment
tonight in Philadelphia.

119
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,130
I am flying there whether
you like it or not.

120
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:53,574
But I must get to Philadelphia tonight.
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I've told you.

121
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:56,769
All transport planes are grounded
because of the weather.

122
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:00,640
Jim Stanton.

123
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:02,479
Helen.

124
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,898
What are you doing out
on a night like this?

125
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,007
Jim. I have got to get
to Philadelphia tonight.

126
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:08,776
You know everybody around here.

127
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:10,904
Couldn't you prevail on
somebody here to take me?

128
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,410
I fly to Philadelphia in a few minutes
but I won't take you in this weather.

129
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,901
Not without written permission
from your husband.

130
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,210
Tom knows all about it.

131
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm going to visit mother.
She hasn't been well.

132
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:21,735
That's funny.

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,401
I examined her a couple of days ago
and she seemed in perfect health.

134
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,674
Jim Stanton, are you trying
to tell me I am lying?

135
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:28,758
No, but ..

136
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:31,967
Even at the pigtail age Helen
you had a good imagination.

137
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:36,060
Had another fight with Tom?
- Don't be silly. I said mother is sick.

138
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:37,560
I must get there, Jim.

139
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,849
I don't know whether you
are telling the truth or not.

140
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:42,502
But I guess it is your business.
Come along.

141
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:43,584
Thanks.

142
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,844
Doctor James Stanton Junior.

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,171
Well, gentlemen. I am all ready to
go through this dirty mess again.

144
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:11,476
Get your microscopes adjusted
and watch me squirm.

145
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,161
Dr Stanton.

146
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,222
This board has been convened
for the purpose of ..

147
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,675
The purpose of helping the newspapers
make a sensational story out of nothing.

148
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:23,076
Running off with another man's
wife can hardly be called nothing.

149
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:25,831
I was flying to Philadelphia.

150
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,375
And by accident a woman was killed.

151
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,760
You know how much I regret that.

152
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:32,771
You know all my testimony.

153
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,952
We know the medical profession has been
dragged into a very distasteful scandal.

154
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:38,311
Jim, I warned you.

155
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,031
When you became a physician.

156
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,981
Did you understand the
meaning of the oath you took?

157
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,971
The oath of Hippocrates which says ..

158
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,502
"Guiltless and hallowed I will
keep my life and mine art."

159
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,150
I understand that oath
very well, gentlemen.

160
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,566
And I also remember a part
of it which most of you ..

161
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,485
Particularly Dr Smythe,
seem to have forgotten.

162
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:03,427
It requires a man to be honorable and
just in dealings with his fellow men.

163
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:04,788
Jim.

164
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:06,967
You are taking the wrong attitude, boy.

165
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,317
This whole matter
isn't important enough.

166
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,391
It is important.

167
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,627
It is important to me to find
out that my .. colleagues.

168
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:15,471
My brothers in medicine.

169
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,617
Have so little faith in me as to refuse
to believe my sworn testimony.

170
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:22,935
For years all I have heard from
my family is how honorable ..

171
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,789
Understanding and loyal to one another
are the men in the medical profession.

172
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:28,353
I believed it.

173
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,338
I put men like you up on a pedestal.

174
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,113
I was proud to be one of you.

175
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,047
Well gentlemen, you have
been vastly overrated.

176
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,152
Dr Stanton.

177
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:37,954
Your attitude is unpardonable.

178
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:39,800
That is exactly what I think of yours.

179
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:41,820
We could ask for your
resignation, Dr Stanton.

180
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,696
However for your father's sake.

181
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:46,953
We'll ignore your actions and abide
by the original verdict of this board.

182
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:49,814
You are hereby adjudged guilty
of unprofessional conduct.

183
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,978
And you are placed on probation in
this hospital until further notice.

184
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,136
Jim.

185
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:05,825
You made a fool of yourself.

186
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,515
If that is being a fool then I
was born wearing a dunce-cap.

187
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,620
You are disgracing our
name in the profession.

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,096
As far as I am concerned the
profession is disgracing our name.

189
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:15,174
You should have known
before asking that woman ..

190
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,634
Helen Richards was my friend.

191
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:18,782
And I thought Tom was too.

192
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:22,665
Perhaps his definition of friendship
didn't include giving you his wife.

193
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:25,662
Dad.

194
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,374
I was sure you would believe me.

195
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:33,156
But no. You wouldn't take a chance of
losing a bit of the reputation of yours.

196
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:34,863
A man in the medical profession ..

197
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:37,379
Must be a proud, respected,
high-handed hypocrite.

198
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:41,417
If that is the way you feel about it.

199
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,543
Why don't you get out of here?

200
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,435
That's just exactly what I Intend to do.

201
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,955
Good evening, Dr Stanton.
- Good evening, Mary.

202
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,232
Is Miss Reed home?

203
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,109
Yes, she is. Come right in.
I'll call her.

204
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,156
Thank you.

205
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:46,332
Barbara.

206
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:47,906
Why, Jim.

207
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:50,697
You look as if you just came
from murdering somebody.

208
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,230
Was it anyone I know?

209
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,998
I've just come from the medical board.

210
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,047
Oh? How are all the longbeards?

211
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,110
Be serious, Barbara. This is important.

212
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,453
They have put me on probation and I ..
- Jim ..

213
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,870
You cannot expect to get
involved in these scandals.

214
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:06,519
And come out untouched.

215
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,883
You should have thought about me.

216
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:10,615
And about your name.

217
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:13,096
You still think I was trying to
run away with Helen Richards?

218
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,218
Well, do you?

219
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,505
We aren't children, Jim.

220
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:28,074
Barbara, I know the whole town hovers
over me like a bunch of vultures but ..

221
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,294
I was sure I could count on you.

222
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:32,000
Of course you can, Jim.

223
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:34,482
Although I can't say
I like the publicity.

224
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,568
But those things soon blow over.

225
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:37,750
But they don't.

226
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,682
Barbara, I am leaving town
and I'm taking you with me.

227
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:43,935
You can't walk out on your
practice and on your father.

228
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,203
I already have.

229
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,015
Where are you going?

230
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,081
Some small town.

231
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:51,550
Erase the blackboard clean and ..

232
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:53,719
Start all over again?
- That's right.

233
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:57,872
I'm going to pick out some place where I
can hang my shingle on a frame house.

234
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,138
And do the things I like.

235
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:01,638
Build up a practice.

236
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,399
And forget that I am Doctor
James Stanton, society doctor.

237
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,094
It will be tough at first because
I haven't much money left but ..

238
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:12,241
But I know we could
make a go of it together.

239
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,463
We get married and take a train tonight.

240
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,254
Jim.

241
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,708
It sounds great.

242
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,865
But it wouldn't work.

243
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,549
You're thinking about struggling
upward side by side.

244
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:27,949
And dashing off heroically in the mid of
night to save lives of little children.

245
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,744
It may be wonderful.

246
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,225
But I just can't see it.

247
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,126
I am thinking about doing our washing.

248
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:36,072
Wearing cotton stockings.

249
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,948
Eating cheap food.

250
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,557
What if it were that way at first?

251
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:42,630
If we love each other.

252
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,035
I am sorry, Jim.

253
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,500
I can't do it.

254
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,658
I promised to marry Dr James
Stanton of Park Avenue.

255
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,581
I am not interested in country doctors.

256
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,824
I was counting on you, Barbara.

257
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,807
I suppose I should have known better.

258
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,287
"<i>All aboard</i>."

259
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:20,127
"<i>Pittsburgh, Cleveland
Chicago, Kansas City</i>."

260
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,290
Hey. Could you give me a lift, mister?

261
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,673
Hop in young fellow.

262
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,775
You look pretty tired.

263
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:23,735
I guess I am.

264
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:25,165
Where you heading for?

265
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:27,209
I don't know. California, I guess.

266
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,775
California.

267
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:32,182
I've been wanting to go to
California for forty years.

268
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:33,807
What's holding you?

269
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:35,794
Too many people depending on me.

270
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,007
Getting sick and having babies.

271
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:39,575
And dying.

272
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,499
I am a doctor, you know.

273
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,697
Yes, I've been practising
around here for forty years.

274
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:46,856
Forty years.

275
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:49,644
Yes. Forty full, fine years.

276
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:53,738
That I wouldn't change for a trip
to California or around the world.

277
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,304
You wouldn't understand, young man.

278
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,052
But there is something about the
medical profession that pays dividends.

279
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:01,977
Spiritual dividends.

280
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:06,400
There is something inside that makes
up for all the worry and lack of money.

281
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:11,996
They certainly did a good job when they
pumped you full of high-sounding ideals.

282
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,334
And you are still not wise to them.

283
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,029
Well, you can have my share.

284
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:18,827
I'll take California.

285
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:26,188
Well, young man.
I have got to turn off here.

286
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,128
Thanks for the ride, doctor.

287
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,078
Give my regards to Hippocrates.

288
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:44,313
I don't know.

289
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,341
This cold weather irks me.

290
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:49,214
I'm for hopping the
next freight out of here.

291
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:50,635
No. That's the gypsy in you.

292
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:51,693
Where you going?

293
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,168
Hey, I've been thinking that out too.

294
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,218
California.

295
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,392
Palm Springs looks good to me.

296
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,495
There is too many fleas.

297
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:03,373
At them desert layouts.

298
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,711
It looks like you don't
have to make the trip.

299
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,855
Here. Pick out your own resort.

300
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:11,028
There is Santa Barbara,
Catalina. Coronado.

301
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,601
Palm Springs.

302
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:16,355
The resort of the elite.

303
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,353
Beautiful women.

304
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,571
Tennis.

305
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,091
Badminton.

306
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:23,730
There is nothing so good like ..

307
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:24,966
Badminton.

308
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,920
Oh .. meals included.

309
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,571
Sounds swell. Let's go.

310
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:30,870
Deal me out.

311
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:33,886
Don't you want to improve
your social standing?

312
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:35,385
Positively.

313
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:38,681
But when I get to California,
no Palm Springs for mine.

314
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm going to Lake Arrowhead
where they have snow.

315
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:44,080
I spent last winter in a boxcar
at Lake Placid, New York.

316
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:46,144
Summer sports for summer.

317
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:47,646
Winter for winter.

318
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:50,967
What you trying to do?
Break up a beautiful friendship?

319
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:53,170
I'll leave it to Close-mouth.

320
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:55,273
If you was us, where would you go?

321
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:57,263
To the mountains or the desert?

322
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,296
Why not compromise
and go to Los Angeles?

323
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:02,495
A lot of our best people go there.

324
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:04,016
That's an idea.

325
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:05,866
I got an uncle that lives there.

326
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:07,401
Under a bridge.

327
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:09,567
Well, your uncle is going
to have company.

328
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:11,118
Coming along, Close-mouth?

329
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:12,357
Sure. Why not?

330
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:16,126
Well, they tell me there is no welcome
there for our fraternity in Los Angeles.

331
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,693
They can't jug you just for
crossing the state line.

332
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,178
Why no. It's an infringement
of your civil rights.

333
00:19:21,614 --> 00:19:22,477
He is right.

334
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,809
They can't toss us in jail ..

335
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,280
Just because we think
working is unethical.

336
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:29,743
On to California!

337
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:30,670
Right.

338
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:43,114
Welcome to Los Angeles, vagrants.

339
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:47,658
Guests in our fair city always have
a variety of things to choose from.

340
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:49,014
Winter sports.

341
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:51,344
Boating, bathing and badminton.

342
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,445
Quiet. Or I will have you
put out of this courtroom.

343
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,335
I mean it. Shut up.

344
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,469
I am going to treat you all as guests.

345
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:03,140
To give you the privilege of
choosing 60 days in jail ..

346
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,962
Or 30 days on the city projects.

347
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:06,768
Sign up with the clerk.

348
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,302
There is a bit of rat in that guy.

349
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,545
Who said California?

350
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:28,048
How come I got to dangle on the
end of one of these muck sticks?

351
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:32,205
When all that tramp has to do is
wave a pretty little red flag.

352
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:35,320
Why didn't you hold
out for winter sports?

353
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,237
Ain't you got the courage
of your own convictions?

354
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:48,303
Hey!

355
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,863
What are you trying to do?
Attack the barricade?

356
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:54,916
Jim.

357
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:58,764
Go on, start moving.
You are blocking the highway.

358
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,420
Jim Stanton, what are you doing here?

359
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,852
Working. And minding my own business.

360
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,061
Gee, it's great to see you again.

361
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:12,098
I guess this meeting is a
sort of a shock to both of us.

362
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,328
I won't ask you any
more questions but ..

363
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:17,009
How much time do you
expect to spend here?

364
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:18,887
Oh, thirty days.

365
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,300
Then I got a reservation
on a freight train.

366
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:24,569
I'm going to do something
about those thirty days ..

367
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,912
And change the train reservation.
- I don't want you to.

368
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:29,152
We'll talk about it later.

369
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,139
Well, there you are.

370
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,354
The story of my misspent life.

371
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,358
What about Barbara Reed?
I thought you were engaged to her.

372
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:11,076
We postponed it.

373
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:13,838
You got a bad case of
chipmunks on your roof.

374
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:18,123
Dick, when I heaved my medical
books out of the window ..

375
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:19,839
I heaved out everything else with them.

376
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:21,898
All that bunk about tradition.

377
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:25,981
All father's highfalutin notions
about how I should run my life.

378
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:28,772
Dick, I'm fed up.

379
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:31,668
Yeah, but you can't stay on with
the pick-and-shovel brigade.

380
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,515
Why not?
- Because you can't.

381
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:35,821
I'm a transport pilot.

382
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,622
And I stand in pretty good with
the boss. Roberts is his name.

383
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,697
He is a good guy and he'll
take you on if I say so.

384
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:42,978
Doing what?

385
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,265
Doc, we got a hospital unit.

386
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,787
A flying ambulance fully equipped
for any kind of an emergency.

387
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:50,726
Now just a minute, Dick.

388
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:52,983
I've told you I was
through with medicine.

389
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:54,332
That's too bad.

390
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:56,528
You'd have been in a swell spot.

391
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,606
Well doc, I'll find you
some sort of a job.

392
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:03,454
Alright. I guess it would be
better than manicuring roads.

393
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:07,816
But I don't want anybody to know
that I have ever been a doctor.

394
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:09,656
So don't call me "Doc".

395
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,758
And don't call me "Stanton."

396
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:13,612
The name is ..

397
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,425
Jones, from here in.

398
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,710
Whatever you say.
Come on, we'll visit Roberts.

399
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,001
Only, we'll detour by
way of the locker room.

400
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,060
Hiya, Alice.
- Hello, Dick.

401
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,569
I don't want him to think
I'm bringing in King Kong.

402
00:23:28,264 --> 00:23:30,050
Well, I don't know. We ..

403
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:32,331
We haven't any openings right now.

404
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,495
But Jones here can tune a motor
until it sings a symphony.

405
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:37,883
And besides, he's a good friend of mine.

406
00:23:38,057 --> 00:23:39,529
Well, that is no recommendation.

407
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:43,186
But if this fellow's half as good as you
say I may be able to find work for him.

408
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,517
As a mechanic. Is that alright with you?

409
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:46,502
Sure.

410
00:23:47,023 --> 00:23:47,781
Yes, sir.

411
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:50,338
Well, you report to Williams.
He has charge of the hangar.

412
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,143
Thank you, Mr Roberts.

413
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,384
Thank you, sir.

414
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:55,541
Now get out of here. I'm busy.

415
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,477
Now you've got a job, such as it is.
- Yeah.

416
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,767
Anyhow, it is better than
doing what you were.

417
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,590
Thanks for the sales talk, Dick.
- I was selling a good commodity.

418
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,522
Hello Dick.

419
00:24:10,622 --> 00:24:12,289
Hiya Doris. How is my little girl today?

420
00:24:12,547 --> 00:24:14,369
I am not your little girl.

421
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,598
Now that we've had our morning greeting.

422
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:18,085
I'd like you to meet Jim Jones.

423
00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:19,069
Hello.

424
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,650
How do you do.

425
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,042
This is Doris King.

426
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,191
The pride and joy of the ambulance unit.

427
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:26,256
But we love her just the same.

428
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:28,816
And Dick is our lying, flying fool.

429
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:30,786
I'll see you later.
- Alright.

430
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,626
Who is the high hat and monocle?

431
00:24:33,946 --> 00:24:35,963
He's a friend of mine.
Just signed on as a mechanic.

432
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,280
I thought he at least owned the
company. What's eating him?

433
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,339
Nothing. He just isn't
interested in women.

434
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:42,603
I think he saves stamps.

435
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,495
Now, don't flutter our eyelashes at him.

436
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:48,065
It is wasted motion.

437
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:50,024
I shall flutter them into a dither.

438
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,617
Alright. If you wear him out
don't say I didn't warn you.

439
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,057
I can always buy more.

440
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:09,364
Hey, mystery man.

441
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,325
What's the matter with you?

442
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:15,181
I've been staying awake nights
trying to figure out if you are ..

443
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:19,069
An escaped criminal, an international
spy or a prince in disguise.

444
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,740
Try counting sheep.
That will put you to sleep.

445
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:25,746
I did and made a tidy little fortune.
Catching them and selling their wool.

446
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,704
I'm not commercial minded.

447
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,164
Just the same, I am on your trail.

448
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:33,172
Let's say goodbye here.
It's a crossroads.

449
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:42,322
Anyway, I warn you.

450
00:25:52,713 --> 00:25:54,572
You got caught in the
downdraught, didn't you.

451
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,068
The dogfight has just begun.

452
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:59,654
That big nut-and-bolt man
intrigues my analytical mind.

453
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:02,006
Listen. If you are tired of
minding your own business.

454
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:03,538
Try minding mine.

455
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,023
And leave him alone.

456
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:07,196
This Jones man is fresh material.

457
00:26:07,595 --> 00:26:09,562
He is the strong, silent type.

458
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,224
Maybe he just hasn't anything to say.

459
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,420
A smart girl could make the Sphinx
propose a weekend in the mountains.

460
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:30,370
Hello.
- Hello.

461
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:31,953
Coffee and doughnuts please.

462
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,661
You are Jones the new man, aren't you?

463
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:35,760
Yeah. Why?

464
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:38,244
I'm Watson. A reporter. On the news.

465
00:26:39,717 --> 00:26:41,019
The boys all call me "Nosy".

466
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:46,405
Where are you from?
- The east.

467
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,868
Always been a mechanic?

468
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:52,284
Maybe.

469
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:57,431
Thanks, chatterbox.

470
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,669
Hello, Nosy.

471
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,471
Hello Doris. How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

472
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:07,527
Hello Doris. Sit down here?

473
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:09,421
No thanks.

474
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,924
Is this seat taken?

475
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:15,538
Yes.

476
00:27:21,368 --> 00:27:23,894
Dick tells me you've done lot of flying.
- Does he?

477
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,989
Ah, you talk your head off, don't you.

478
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:28,515
No.

479
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:32,544
You know, I've been wondering about
you. You aren't the mechanic type.

480
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:36,093
You don't act like one, you don't
talk like one. And your hands are ..

481
00:27:36,193 --> 00:27:38,375
Did you come in here to eat
or to keep me from eating?

482
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,454
I came in just to keep you company.
You looked lonesome.

483
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:43,388
A cup of coffee.

484
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,651
And two doughnuts for the lady.
- I don't want doughnuts.

485
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:47,242
Doughnuts.
- Why doughnuts?

486
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:50,167
When you mouth is full
you won't be able to talk.

487
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:05,113
Hello Dick.
- HI, Eddie.

488
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:06,681
Hiya, Mack.

489
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:09,554
Hello Dick. You want a seat?
- No thanks. I'm looking for Jones.

490
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:11,235
Well, he is not looking for you.

491
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,794
Well, the dirty bachelor.

492
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,946
Pardon me, is this woman annoying you?

493
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:21,628
Why, not at all. She is a
charming conversationalist.

494
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:23,967
And her table manners are superb.

495
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,484
Wait a minute. Your cap.

496
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:28,092
Thank you.

497
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,315
Coffee please.

498
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,039
So how goes the battle?

499
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,306
The enemy is weakening.
I made him laugh.

500
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,111
He is a nice guy underneath.
Way underneath.

501
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:42,772
Where did you meet him?

502
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,672
I taught him to fly.

503
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:46,736
What has been doing since then?

504
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:47,835
What?

505
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:50,457
Say, is this the third degree?

506
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:52,866
How about minding your own business?

507
00:28:57,732 --> 00:29:00,150
I am going into town for a while.
You know where you can reach me.

508
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:01,960
Give her my love.
- What?

509
00:29:12,442 --> 00:29:15,470
Coffee and doughnuts. 15 cents.
- Mr Jones left his check for you.

510
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:17,766
He said you owed it to
him for entertaining you.

511
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,868
"<i>Attention. Emergency</i>."

512
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,066
"<i>Castle, Miller. Doris King</i>."

513
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,550
"<i>Report to Mr Roberts</i>."

514
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:30,885
"<i>Ground crews</i>."

515
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,260
"<i>Get ambulance plane
ready for immediate take-off</i>."

516
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:38,483
"<i>Emergency</i>."

517
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:41,469
"<i>Castle, Miller. Doris King</i>."

518
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,241
"<i>Report immediately</i>."

519
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,711
Have you seen Castle and Miller?
- No.

520
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:49,429
If you see them tell them to report
to the old man. He is primed.

521
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,565
Doris, you are to pick
up a very sick man.

522
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,781
If I can find one of my pilots.
- Yes, sir.

523
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,171
Hello?

524
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:02,285
What?

525
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,188
Alright .. alright.

526
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:08,185
That was Castle.
He's in home in bed with the flu.

527
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:10,657
Where is Dick Miller?
- Dick is off duty.

528
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,279
I know it. I've looked
high and low for him.

529
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,072
Doris, he is the only man available.

530
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,161
Say. You know all of his hangouts.

531
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:18,310
Find him.

532
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,391
By the time I find Dick, our patient
will able to walk here.

533
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:24,095
You will bring Miller here if you
have to drag the rivers for him.

534
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:26,904
He doesn't take off on his
usual run until 9 o'clock.

535
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:28,734
It gives him time to
make this hop for me.

536
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:30,708
Here is a report on the
case and your orders.

537
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:31,861
Get busy.

538
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,679
I'll find a pilot for you.

539
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:41,698
Jones.

540
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:44,494
Get ready. We're taking the
ship and picking up a patient.

541
00:30:44,691 --> 00:30:45,868
What do you mean, "we"?

542
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:48,105
Just what I said. Castle is
sick and we can't find Dick.

543
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,860
Where do I come in? I'm a mechanic.
- You are also a pilot, aren't you?

544
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:52,225
Sure, but ..
- No buts.

545
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,307
It's an emergency case.
We've got to get to him.

546
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:55,761
That's your job, not mine.

547
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:57,939
It is your job to take
orders from Roberts.

548
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,717
Well, how does he know
I can handle the ship?

549
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:03,734
Dick told him. Said that he taught you.

550
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:06,241
You are wasting time.
Come on, Jim. Hurry.

551
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:09,001
Alright. What are we standing
around arguing for?

552
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:26,014
He's been in terrific pain.

553
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,607
I gave him a hypodermic.

554
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:29,635
That should keep him quiet on the trip.

555
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:40,040
Well, goodbye, Dr Farrell.
- Goodbye, Miss King.

556
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,158
All set?
- All set.

557
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,210
I can't stand it.

558
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:09,101
It's alright. Get back down ..
- Let me go!

559
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:14,140
I want to get out that door.
- Get back.

560
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:15,934
Jim!
- Let me go.

561
00:33:20,054 --> 00:33:21,423
Jim!
- Let me go!

562
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,279
Easy does it.

563
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:42,864
Are you hurt?

564
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:45,044
I'm alright. I've got to
do something for him.

565
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:46,831
Give him a quarter grain of morphine.

566
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:50,478
Hurry.

567
00:33:58,018 --> 00:34:00,207
You'd better let me do that.
You are shaking pretty badly.

568
00:34:11,837 --> 00:34:13,621
I'm alright now. I'll take care of him.

569
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:40,025
A nice quiet trip, wasn't it.

570
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:42,959
How do you like piloting?
- I enjoyed it. A great feeling.

571
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,369
I'm glad you liked it.

572
00:34:44,677 --> 00:34:47,764
Maybe you won't like it so well
after Roberts gets through with you.

573
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,773
So, while Doris was battling
with him I was flying the plane.

574
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:04,751
The first I knew of the whole business
was when she opened the cabin door.

575
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:08,016
You are saying that little girl put that
guy out of the way without your help?

576
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,707
Sure she did. She's dynamite.

577
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,928
Sounds kinda screwy to me.

578
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:13,751
Haven't you ever heard of Ju-jutsu?

579
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,213
Japanese wrestling.

580
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:16,707
And how.

581
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,027
A little bit of a guy threw
me out of a bar once.

582
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:21,295
Yeah, well that's what she used.
- Ju-jutsu?

583
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:22,894
What a story.

584
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:25,778
I'll spread that all over the
front pages before noon.

585
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:28,275
See you later. I'm going
to grab pictures of the ship.

586
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,122
And the kid herself.
- Hey, Nosy.

587
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:32,987
Doris may try to give you another
story but don't believe her.

588
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:34,239
She's just modest.

589
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,395
Don't worry. Nobody ever
fooled Nosy Watson.

590
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:37,216
Yeah.

591
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,907
Alright, Jim. That's for the newspapers.

592
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:42,367
Now what really happened?
- Just what I told Nosy.

593
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,625
That Doris is a handful
of angry crazy wildcat.

594
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,038
I get it. She did it
with her little hands.

595
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:51,045
What I am wondering is, why did
Roberts send you on that hop at all?

596
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:52,587
Doris knew where to reach me.

597
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,566
She did?

598
00:35:57,736 --> 00:36:00,164
Well I might have known our
little politician cooked it up.

599
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:07,852
[ Door knocks ]

600
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,110
Come in.

601
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:12,155
Well Doris.

602
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,901
You seem to have taken the management
of this airport into your own hands.

603
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:18,717
Why did you disobey my orders and let a
mechanic fly a plane in this emergency?

604
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:20,941
Who is running this airport, you or me?

605
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,076
You are, sir.

606
00:36:22,622 --> 00:36:24,746
Didn't I tell you to find
Dick Miller last night?

607
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:26,764
Well, you said that
it was an emergency ..

608
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:29,333
And I knew that Dick was
pretty far away out on a date ..

609
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:31,368
Doris, you didn't even look for Dick.

610
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:33,082
I know it, Mr Roberts.

611
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:34,814
Well, why didn't you?

612
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:36,962
I ought to fire you right on the spot.

613
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,870
You can do it but you will be sorry.

614
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,443
Jim Jones is the kind
of man we need here.

615
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:43,874
He is meant for something
better than a mechanic's job.

616
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:45,708
I watched him day after day.

617
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,619
I've tried to get him to open
up without much success but ..

618
00:36:48,926 --> 00:36:51,163
I do know this.
You couldn't find a better pilot.

619
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,404
You should have seen
him handle that plane ..

620
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:55,566
And take care of my patient
when he got out of hand.

621
00:36:55,768 --> 00:36:58,266
Mr Roberts, you have got
to make Jim Jones a pilot.

622
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:01,821
Young lady, I had you come in
here to give you a good talking to.

623
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:05,001
And I can't have you turn discipline
sessions into your own triumphs.

624
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:07,764
What are you trying to do,
wind me around your finger?

625
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:09,977
That wouldn't be a bad idea either.

626
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:11,555
If I hadn't met Jim.

627
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:16,652
Get out of here before you try to talk
me into resigning in favor of Mr Jones.

628
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,421
Does he stay on as a pilot?
- That is none of your business.

629
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:21,477
Get Jim Jones.

630
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:23,351
I'll get him. I know just where he is.

631
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:24,905
Don't get Jones.

632
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,086
Morning, boys.

633
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:34,516
The mighty, mighty.

634
00:37:34,914 --> 00:37:36,108
With her mighty rags.

635
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:37,402
Where is Jones?

636
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:38,829
Oh, he is hiding.

637
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:41,584
He is afraid you will
pop him on the smeller.

638
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:49,493
Good morning.

639
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,104
Not with you around.

640
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,496
Thanks for putting me in
newspaper headlines.

641
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,650
That's alright.

642
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,072
I bought two copies
for wrapping packages.

643
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,777
Jones, for a man who
doesn't talk much ..

644
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:02,130
You certainly delivered
a long lecture to Nosy.

645
00:38:02,535 --> 00:38:04,094
Just wanted to beat you to the punch.

646
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:06,239
Everybody around here
knows what really happened.

647
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:08,470
Why don't you take
credit when it's yours?

648
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:10,889
I'm not interested.
- You ought to be.

649
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,018
Or is it your ambition to stay
a grease-monkey forever?

650
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,398
Never mind my ambitions.
- Don't be an idiot.

651
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:19,299
I'm not trying to inspire you.

652
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:21,614
I'm just trying to talk a little sense.

653
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:23,843
Why do you always fight me off?

654
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:25,908
I haven't any designs on you.

655
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:28,528
I don't know why I
even bother about you.

656
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,357
Well, I wish you wouldn't
bother about me.

657
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:34,041
Alright, Jones.
If that's the way you want it.

658
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:36,461
Try and get it.

659
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,624
I almost forgot.
Roberts wants to see you right away.

660
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:43,615
I guess you fixed that too?

661
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:46,263
A little more help from you
and I'll be out altogether.

662
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,665
Yes, Mr Roberts.
We're looking for Mr Jones.

663
00:38:59,106 --> 00:38:59,723
Oh.

664
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:08,158
That guy sure handles
himself like he was somebody.

665
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:10,883
Say. Who is he, anyway?

666
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,193
I mean .. really.
- Him?

667
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:14,873
Why that is Jim Jones.

668
00:39:15,423 --> 00:39:16,324
From the east.

669
00:39:17,798 --> 00:39:19,260
Thanks. We'll get out and extra.

670
00:39:21,287 --> 00:39:22,875
You weren't supposed to fly that ship.

671
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:25,093
You and Doris endangered
the life of her patient.

672
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,724
Yes. And you took a chance on wrecking
the reputation of this company.

673
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:30,136
I might have known it was
one of her bright ideas.

674
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:32,460
You think I'd have flown
the ship if I knew that?

675
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,790
You didn't use your head.

676
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,688
If anything had gone wrong we'd
have had a nice lawsuit on our hands.

677
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,665
And this company wouldn't get
another nickel's worth of business.

678
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,416
If that's the way you feel about it.

679
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:43,297
Oh no. You don't get a chance to quit.

680
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:44,660
You are fired.

681
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:46,787
It's alright with me.
- Now wait a minute.

682
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:47,765
Take it easy.

683
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:52,429
If anything had gone wrong you and
Doris would have been responsible.

684
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:55,631
But since her judgement was vindicated.

685
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,871
I am going to take full advantage of it.

686
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:00,351
Jones, I am firing you as a mechanic.

687
00:40:00,824 --> 00:40:02,125
And hiring you as a pilot.

688
00:40:03,895 --> 00:40:05,111
Is your license in order?

689
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:06,876
I haven't renewed it yet.

690
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,712
So, you'd better over to the Department
of Commerce and take care of it.

691
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,394
But I .. I don't want the job, sir.

692
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:14,828
You are not letting King down, are you?

693
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:16,186
King?
- Sure.

694
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:19,043
She has been bullying me
for days to give you a chance.

695
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:22,227
Jones, that girl has got a
lot of confidence in you.

696
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,682
To have Doris like you is the biggest
break a man can get at this airport.

697
00:40:28,055 --> 00:40:29,872
Well, I guess that includes
all the airports.

698
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:32,208
I'll take the job, sir. Thanks a lot.

699
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,055
Good luck.
- Thank you.

700
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:39,042
If you want to know more about
Jones, why don't you ask Jones?

701
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,609
Call Mr Evans at the
Department of Commerce.

702
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:49,183
Tell him one of our boys is coming
over to have his license renewed.

703
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:51,206
Ask him to take care
of it for me, will you.

704
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,144
Yes, sir.

705
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:57,572
So Roberts is making a pilot
of Jim Jones from the east.

706
00:40:57,986 --> 00:41:00,509
Sure. Doris King was in here
all day raving about him.

707
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:03,532
Jim Jones from the east.

708
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,103
It sounds to me like a phony
name for a hotel register.

709
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:08,671
It couldn't be a phony.

710
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:11,310
Not if he has a license from
the Department of Commerce.

711
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:13,873
That is just what I was thinking.

712
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:18,069
You are going to get your nose caught
in a lawnmower one of these days.

713
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:20,256
When I do you will read
about it in my paper.

714
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:21,414
Exclusive.

715
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:23,292
And with pictures.

716
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,096
How are you going to get your license
renewed under the name of Jim Jones?

717
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:34,105
I'm not. I am renewing
it as James Stanton.

718
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,015
Nobody else has to know that.

719
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:39,053
It seems to me you are
jumping feet first into a bear trap.

720
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,327
If the Flying Board inspectors check up.

721
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,099
Roberts will find out all about you.

722
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:45,890
Sure he will, but by that time I
hope to have the job sewn up.

723
00:41:46,224 --> 00:41:47,383
I can't let Doris down.

724
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,274
I am with you, Doc.

725
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:54,731
Oh. So Doris took care of the
patient but you get the promotion.

726
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:57,352
What are you trying to do,
confuse the press?

727
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,403
How about giving me a story?

728
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:00,862
Sure, Nosy.

729
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:03,212
Once upon a time there
was three bears ..

730
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:17,418
There you are, Stanton.

731
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:19,207
You are all set for another six months.

732
00:42:19,557 --> 00:42:20,573
Thanks again, sir.

733
00:42:20,812 --> 00:42:22,343
See you around, Inspector.
- Right.

734
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:33,441
Hiya, Nosy.

735
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:36,262
How is the peeping-tom business?
- It strains my eyes.

736
00:42:37,669 --> 00:42:40,408
I just saw a guy outside I
haven't seen in a long while.

737
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:43,020
He just came out of
here with Dick Miller.

738
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:46,408
I don't remember his last name but
I think we used to call him "Doc".

739
00:42:46,656 --> 00:42:47,528
Doc?
- Yeah.

740
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:48,715
Was it Dr Stanton?

741
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:50,152
Yeah.

742
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:51,787
Dr Stanton, that's it.

743
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,720
He just had his license renewed.

744
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,730
He is from Boston, isn't he?

745
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:57,044
No. New York.

746
00:42:58,224 --> 00:42:59,863
Oh .. I remember.

747
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,105
He is the Dr Stanton who
was in that society scandal.

748
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:04,692
He cracked up his plane.

749
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:06,089
Yeah. He is the one.

750
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:08,692
The Department investigated
the crash. It wasn't his fault.

751
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,177
Too bad the woman was killed.

752
00:43:14,116 --> 00:43:14,851
Doris.

753
00:43:15,466 --> 00:43:16,138
Doris.

754
00:43:16,404 --> 00:43:18,192
I have a story that
will knock your hat off.

755
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:19,978
Where is Jim Jones? I've got to see him.

756
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:22,803
I don't know. What's all the excitement?
- Do you know who Jones really is?

757
00:43:23,086 --> 00:43:23,930
Santa Claus.

758
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:25,471
No .. seriously.

759
00:43:25,922 --> 00:43:27,751
It will drop you through a trap door.

760
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:29,794
Now let me see. Peter Pan?

761
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:33,917
Did you ever hear of Doctor
James Stanton, senior or junior?

762
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,296
Of course. Who hasn't?

763
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,980
Jim Jones is Dr James Stanton junior.

764
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:40,676
The one who was engaged to Barbara Reed.

765
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,174
That high-society dame.

766
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:45,681
But why all the secrecy?
What is he doing as Jim Jones?

767
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:47,291
That's what I am going to find out.

768
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,717
I will squeeze every bit of story out of
him if I have to use a meat grinder.

769
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:52,230
Nosy, you can't print that.

770
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,831
The biggest story of the year.

771
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,470
And you say I can't print it?

772
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:56,837
Why?
- Because ..

773
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:59,503
There is some reason why he
is Jim Jones and a mechanic.

774
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:02,093
I've got a hunch if we find
out what is behind all this.

775
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,363
It will be the biggest scoop
you have ever come across.

776
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:06,857
If you print that story now,
he will run away.

777
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,094
But I had my yarn practically written.

778
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:11,293
But with him gone it will
only make a ripple.

779
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:14,079
I know you will get a smash story.
One that will make you famous.

780
00:44:14,294 --> 00:44:15,918
If you just give me a chance with him.

781
00:44:16,018 --> 00:44:18,167
I promise you I will find out
what is behind all this.

782
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,965
And you will be the first to know.
Just give me a few days.

783
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:22,159
Alright, Doris.

784
00:44:22,345 --> 00:44:24,195
If you say so, I'll hold the story back.

785
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:27,484
You always did have
the Indian sign on me.

786
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:30,037
That's what I get for mixing
women and business.

787
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:40,574
Mr Roberts.

788
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:42,354
Have you any confidence in me?

789
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:44,000
Why .. of course.

790
00:44:44,272 --> 00:44:46,507
Then assign Jim Jones to
pilot the ambulance ship.

791
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:50,604
Haven't you enough to do as a nurse
without running the whole airport?

792
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:53,027
Please, Mr Roberts.
It means a lot to me.

793
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:55,096
I ..

794
00:44:56,012 --> 00:44:58,201
I'd like to have you look over
the list of our executives.

795
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,762
There might be another position
you'd rather have for Mr Jones.

796
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,535
Mr Roberts, you need a regular
an on the ambulance ship.

797
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,516
Look what happened when Castle was sick.

798
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,471
Dick Miller is kept busy on his
transport run and so is McClintock.

799
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,441
You know you can use another pilot.

800
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:13,015
And Jim Jones is the
one to fly the ambulance.

801
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:15,956
You seem to know
more about it than I do.

802
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:18,812
You may be right at that.

803
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:21,193
You are making history.

804
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:35,475
Hey, watch for air parking.

805
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:37,225
We're taking you home to wash your face.

806
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:39,600
And to put on your best bib and
tucker. We're celebrating.

807
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:42,867
Jim's probationary period is over.
Roberts is going to let him fly.

808
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:45,470
Gee, that's swell. Let me down.

809
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:47,492
Jim, you get a kiss for this.

810
00:45:49,924 --> 00:45:50,623
Hey.

811
00:45:51,013 --> 00:45:53,717
Don't forget that stuff
about a woman scorned.

812
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:09,683
Are you becoming acutely conscious
of a wheezing concertina?

813
00:46:09,995 --> 00:46:12,102
I like it. It is so romantic.

814
00:46:12,585 --> 00:46:14,030
Splendid. I will have it removed.

815
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,939
Say, Officer. Would you send this
wandering minstrel on his way.

816
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:19,934
Kick him back into the 15th Century.

817
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:21,792
Isn't he a friend of yours?

818
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:23,582
Never saw before in our lives.

819
00:46:24,856 --> 00:46:25,952
Hey, wait a minute.

820
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:28,437
On our way or I'll run you in.

821
00:46:28,642 --> 00:46:30,061
You can't arrest me.

822
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,270
Can't you leave these folks be?

823
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:34,787
Anybody could see they want to be alone.

824
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,799
Do we?
- What?

825
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:43,678
Want to be alone.

826
00:46:44,564 --> 00:46:45,208
Uhuh.

827
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:48,712
You know, Jim. You are lucky.

828
00:46:49,637 --> 00:46:52,594
Being a flyer is just about the
finest job a man can have.

829
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:54,420
Except one.

830
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:55,856
And what is that?

831
00:46:57,505 --> 00:46:58,435
Being a doctor.

832
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:03,980
Well, I wouldn't touch the medical
profession with a banana stalk.

833
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,458
It is full of stuffed shirts.

834
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:08,638
My father was a doctor.

835
00:47:09,504 --> 00:47:10,663
I wanted to be one too.

836
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:13,654
You are doing alright as a nurse.

837
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:17,518
Sometimes I want to be a lion
tamer or something else.

838
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:18,916
And then ..

839
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,696
Along comes an interesting
case and I am a nurse again.

840
00:47:23,532 --> 00:47:24,734
Let's talk about you.

841
00:47:25,115 --> 00:47:26,760
You know, you'd have made a fine doctor.

842
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,317
What makes you say that?

843
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:32,415
I don't know. I guess
it's just because ..

844
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:35,188
You always seem to me as though
you were diagnosing my case.

845
00:47:36,546 --> 00:47:38,506
You're letting your imagination
run away with you.

846
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,563
Flying is good enough for me.

847
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,561
I am glad you are satisfied.

848
00:47:46,403 --> 00:47:47,583
When I first met you ..

849
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:50,818
You reminded me of a little
Scottie I had once seen.

850
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:52,839
He'd just been run over.

851
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:55,471
He didn't bark or whine but ..

852
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:58,034
I could see the hurt in his eyes.

853
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,886
Just as I could in yours.

854
00:48:00,893 --> 00:48:03,282
When I tried to draw you out you
said it was none of my business.

855
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:04,806
It wasn't.

856
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:06,499
But I wanted to help you.

857
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:09,280
I just think I went about
it in the wrong way.

858
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:11,918
You talk too much.

859
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:21,618
Did you know it was raining?

860
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:44,963
Seen Jim yet?
- No.

861
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:48,512
But according to the bulletin board he
has been assigned to the hospital unit.

862
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:50,304
I wonder how he is going to take it.

863
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,278
Why shouldn't it be alright?

864
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:01,672
Why did you frame me into that ambulance
job? I told you I didn't want it.

865
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,817
Now wait a minute.
- I talked Roberts into it.

866
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:07,324
Why? Why should you take it
on yourself to change my job?

867
00:49:07,515 --> 00:49:08,582
Because I love you.

868
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:11,061
I did it for your sake.
To snap you out of your shell.

869
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,415
Maybe I like that shell.

870
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:13,875
I'm seeing Roberts about this.

871
00:49:13,975 --> 00:49:15,977
Jim, you can't back out now.
This is your chance.

872
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,103
Now try to get this into
your head, will you.

873
00:49:18,203 --> 00:49:20,751
I am not flying any ambulance ship.
And I don't want you meddling.

874
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:22,322
You ran from the medical board.

875
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:24,732
You ran out of town and you've
been running away ever since.

876
00:49:24,976 --> 00:49:26,363
Yes. I know you are Dr Stanton.

877
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,754
I know all about you.
But get this into your head.

878
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:32,469
Every time you run away, you're bound
to run right smack up against yourself.

879
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:35,473
And the next time you do, take
a good look. You won't like it.

880
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:37,551
Are you through?

881
00:49:37,651 --> 00:49:39,206
Certainly I'm through. In every way.

882
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:41,606
So pick up your marbles
and run home little boy.

883
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:43,324
The game is too tough for you.

884
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:45,030
Thanks.

885
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:53,392
You certainly handed it to him.
- I had to, Dick.

886
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:56,774
I had to make him realize that
he is hurting himself and me.

887
00:49:58,615 --> 00:50:00,383
I guess you are all
washed up with him now?

888
00:50:00,586 --> 00:50:03,460
Oh, no I'm not. I've got an
idea and I need your help.

889
00:50:15,602 --> 00:50:16,982
Doris King.
- Seat 12.

890
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:28,940
Hiya, Jim.

891
00:50:34,296 --> 00:50:35,415
Dick, I am sorry I ..

892
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,689
Skip it.

893
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:38,726
Alright.

894
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:41,611
Going somewhere?
- Yeah.

895
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:44,771
I'm going to lift my anchor.

896
00:50:45,024 --> 00:50:45,667
Fine.

897
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:47,483
Sad to see you go.

898
00:50:51,512 --> 00:50:53,012
Now that you and Doris are gone.

899
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:55,392
I have time to mend my socks.

900
00:50:55,888 --> 00:50:57,652
But I am going to miss old Doris.

901
00:50:57,934 --> 00:50:59,550
Miss Doris? What are you talking about?

902
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:01,039
She has gone.

903
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,809
She put her freight on
the afternoon plane.

904
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:07,748
But there is no sense in her leaving.

905
00:51:07,912 --> 00:51:11,236
I guess she got tired
of you sneering at her.

906
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:15,616
Well, she'll come back as soon
as she hears I'm out of her way.

907
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:16,847
Sure, sure.

908
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,313
As soon as she has a chance to
figure out what a mouse you are.

909
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:24,495
She was only in love with the
guy she used to <i>think</i> you were.

910
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,086
Maybe you are right.

911
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:30,481
Listen.

912
00:51:32,742 --> 00:51:36,228
I am having my appendicitis
scar painted over.

913
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:39,523
Because it reminds me of you.

914
00:51:46,314 --> 00:51:47,892
And where do you think you are going?

915
00:51:48,286 --> 00:51:50,010
I'm going to make my run to El Paso.

916
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:52,424
I want to get plastered down there.

917
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:54,048
You can't fly in that condition.

918
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:56,435
I can't, can't I?
Who is going to stop me?

919
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:57,922
I am.

920
00:52:15,459 --> 00:52:17,161
Hello. Get me the
Roberts Airline please.

921
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,030
Hello. I want to speak to Mr Roberts.

922
00:52:23,986 --> 00:52:25,002
Jim Jones calling.

923
00:52:28,175 --> 00:52:29,261
Hello, Mr Roberts?

924
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:32,957
Well Dick Miller is over here
and he is .. he is pretty sick.

925
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:35,519
Ptomaine poisoning I think.

926
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:38,594
He can't make that trip to El Paso.

927
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:41,074
But I'll take it if you
are short of pilots.

928
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:45,401
Alright, sir. I'll be right over.

929
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,947
Hello? General Hospital?

930
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,336
Dr Stanton please.

931
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,368
Hello, Dr Stanton?

932
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,280
This is Doris King, a nurse.

933
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:16,024
I've just came from your son.

934
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:18,254
You came from Jim? Is he alright?

935
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:22,362
What is he up to?
Is he practising medicine?

936
00:53:22,715 --> 00:53:23,669
No, he isn't.

937
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:25,201
He is working at our airport.

938
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:26,721
Oh, he is, is he?

939
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:29,314
That's all I wanted to know.

940
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,425
Hello?

941
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:32,762
Dr Stanton?

942
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:51,465
[ Buzzer ]

943
00:53:54,446 --> 00:53:56,561
Is Miss Reed in?
- Who is calling please?

944
00:53:56,806 --> 00:53:59,216
Miss Doris King. Just say it
is about James Stanton.

945
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:01,076
That's alright, Mary.

946
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,441
Did you say you wanted to talk
to me about Jim Stanton?

947
00:54:06,771 --> 00:54:07,729
That's the idea.

948
00:54:07,957 --> 00:54:10,315
I am Doris King, a nurse
at the Los Angeles airport.

949
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,569
Miss King: Mr Howard Dennis, my fiancée.

950
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:20,216
How do you do.
- How do you do.

951
00:54:20,316 --> 00:54:21,274
Please sit down.

952
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,933
Cigarette?
- No thank you.

953
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:25,517
I guess you are wondering
what brings me here.

954
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:26,473
Yes, I am.

955
00:54:26,883 --> 00:54:29,985
You surely aren't Jim's kindly old aunt
come to patch things up between us.

956
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,472
I've come here to ask for help for Jim.

957
00:54:32,878 --> 00:54:35,236
He is in a critical spot
working around the airport.

958
00:54:35,768 --> 00:54:37,556
I've tried to get him
back where he belongs.

959
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,861
He is a doctor at heart
and he has got to be one.

960
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:43,059
Admitting that you love Jim and
he is in some kind of a spot ..

961
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:46,358
Why should he come back into my life
considering that he's already out of it?

962
00:54:46,842 --> 00:54:48,229
I have tried to see his father.

963
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:50,086
I am sure he could influence Jim.

964
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,030
But Dr Stanton is as
bull-headed as his boy.

965
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:54,703
He won't even talk to you.

966
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,499
That is where you come in.
You've got to make him listen to me.

967
00:54:58,646 --> 00:54:59,690
It is very amusing.

968
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:03,013
Don't you know that woman number one
is supposed to hate woman number two?

969
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:04,865
Rather than accompany the other?

970
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:07,809
I am sorry. I knew there wasn't much
chance of you helping me but ..

971
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:11,282
But .. well I was clutching
at any straws in sight.

972
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:13,222
And I guess I end up with no straws.

973
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:15,128
Wait a moment.

974
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:17,300
I love Howard now.

975
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:19,253
Then you will help me?
- Sure.

976
00:55:20,018 --> 00:55:22,421
Can you get my coat, Howard?
I think we had better go now.

977
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:24,654
I tell you something funny, Miss King.

978
00:55:25,342 --> 00:55:27,981
Sometimes, I still catch
myself thinking of Jim.

979
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,629
Don't worry. Jim and I could
never get together again.

980
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:36,022
Maybe if I got him definitely married
to you I could forget him myself.

981
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:37,493
Here you are.

982
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:39,400
Wait for me, Howard. I will be back.

983
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:40,544
The keys.

984
00:55:50,763 --> 00:55:51,777
Hello, Barbara.

985
00:55:52,062 --> 00:55:53,555
Hello doctor. Been waiting long?

986
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,278
When an elderly man accepts a rendezvous
with a beautiful young girl ..

987
00:55:57,481 --> 00:55:59,463
He is prepared to wait
as long as is necessary.

988
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,873
Correction please.
Two beautiful young girls.

989
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:04,036
I want you to meet Miss King.
- How do you do.

990
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,712
How do you do.
- Won't you sit down?

991
00:56:07,173 --> 00:56:08,898
I have ordered two
steak dinners for you.

992
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,618
A typical Stanton gesture.

993
00:56:10,922 --> 00:56:13,573
Everybody has to eat what he orders.
- I know what is best for you.

994
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,266
Waiter.
- Yes, sir?

995
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:16,669
Two steak dinners please.

996
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,879
Now, what is this so-important business
that drags me out of the hospital?

997
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:24,159
It is Jim. Miss King has
just come from him.

998
00:56:25,203 --> 00:56:27,464
Barbara, I'd never have thought that ..
- Sit down, doctor.

999
00:56:27,743 --> 00:56:30,536
It's about time you and I started
listening and hearing about ourselves.

1000
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,741
In doing what we can to bring Jim
out of the muddle we drove him into.

1001
00:56:34,137 --> 00:56:35,762
I have done nothing to be ashamed of.

1002
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:38,301
When Doris starts talking
you may change your mind.

1003
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:39,552
Please, Barbara.

1004
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:41,902
Nothing can change my mind.

1005
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,120
Doris. Tell him what you told me.

1006
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,717
Dr Stanton, I have come
a long way for this.

1007
00:57:04,368 --> 00:57:06,271
Hey, what is the idea?
Have you been dodging me?

1008
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:10,018
I've been looking for you for two days.
Ever since you got back from El Paso.

1009
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:12,770
Jim, I want to thank you.
- Ah, forget it.

1010
00:57:13,753 --> 00:57:16,261
I guess I have been enough to
drive you and Doris both to drink.

1011
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,587
Been checking up on yourself, huh?

1012
00:57:19,009 --> 00:57:21,191
I had plenty of time to
think up in that plane.

1013
00:57:22,435 --> 00:57:25,837
I could hear all the names you and
Doris called me in alphabetical order.

1014
00:57:27,954 --> 00:57:29,141
Did you agree with them?

1015
00:57:29,253 --> 00:57:30,154
And then some.

1016
00:57:31,183 --> 00:57:33,114
But the 'running away' part
doesn't hold anymore.

1017
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:35,163
Then you are going to stick it out, huh?

1018
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:36,011
Sure.

1019
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:39,030
There is always a chance
Doris will come back.

1020
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:42,301
I'll have coffee and doughnuts on that.

1021
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:43,940
Hey, Marie.

1022
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,199
Coffee and ..

1023
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:55,804
You've outsmarted me again, young lady.

1024
00:57:56,082 --> 00:57:57,381
I just called your bluff.

1025
00:57:58,523 --> 00:58:00,082
You know Doris, I have been thinking.

1026
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:02,175
I came away on a sudden wave of emotion.

1027
00:58:02,862 --> 00:58:04,021
Now that it has passed.

1028
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:06,876
I can't help wondering if
this isn't a wild goose chase.

1029
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:10,090
Jim won't listen to me.
- I have tried everything else.

1030
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:20,477
Hello, Ed.

1031
00:58:21,028 --> 00:58:22,915
Dispatcher's office. Joe speaking.

1032
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:25,784
Number 19 just went
through Pine Forks on time.

1033
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,708
Alright, Joe.

1034
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:45,968
Hello.

1035
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:48,438
Got it.

1036
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:50,532
Which number 19?

1037
00:58:51,086 --> 00:58:52,348
Number 19 Express.

1038
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:53,843
Alright.

1039
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:28,623
Give me the office.

1040
00:59:29,494 --> 00:59:32,198
Joe. The mainline switch is stuck.
Can you stop number 19?

1041
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:35,106
But I can't, Joe. It's stuck!

1042
01:00:03,421 --> 01:00:05,622
Number 19 is wrecked.
Send help as fast as you can.

1043
01:00:07,077 --> 01:00:08,134
"<i>Miller. Jones</i>."

1044
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:10,218
"<i>Report to Mr Roberts'
office immediately</i>."

1045
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:11,496
"<i>Emergency!</i>"

1046
01:00:11,836 --> 01:00:15,999
"<i>Ground crews. Get transport
W8 and hospital unit ready</i>."

1047
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,713
Alright. Let me know
if they need anything else.

1048
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:23,495
There's been a bad train wreck in the
mountains. 20 miles west of Pine Forks.

1049
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:26,752
No town near there for us to get doctors
and supplies to them, so it is up to us.

1050
01:00:27,005 --> 01:00:29,099
Dick. The hospital is rushing
some doctors over here.

1051
01:00:29,277 --> 01:00:31,630
When they arrive you must take
them in your plane to the wreck.

1052
01:00:31,818 --> 01:00:34,315
Jones, I depend on you to fly the
ambulance ship with the nurses.

1053
01:00:34,513 --> 01:00:37,156
They are waiting for you.
Now get going just as soon as possible.

1054
01:00:37,974 --> 01:00:38,732
Yes, sir.

1055
01:00:39,383 --> 01:00:41,514
I'll be there before you get
your wheels off the ground.

1056
01:01:15,864 --> 01:01:16,565
Doctor.

1057
01:01:16,808 --> 01:01:18,834
We've found another man.
He is in pretty bad shape.

1058
01:01:19,587 --> 01:01:20,746
I'll be right with you.

1059
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:23,494
I've done all I can.
Keep him well covered.

1060
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:26,536
Come on, Doris.

1061
01:01:37,716 --> 01:01:38,745
Getting close.

1062
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:40,933
We should be able to see the wreck soon.

1063
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:41,161
Doctor. Will you come?

1064
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,947
I am not the doctor. The plane with
the doctors will be here any moment.

1065
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:46,478
Come along anyway.
We need all the help we can get.

1066
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:57,425
Thank goodness you've come.

1067
01:02:57,847 --> 01:02:59,893
I tell you there is nothing
we can do for this child.

1068
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:02,120
0nly an emergency
operation can save him.

1069
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:03,775
We came in ambulance plane.

1070
01:03:04,004 --> 01:03:05,248
It is completely equipped.

1071
01:03:06,934 --> 01:03:08,035
Get everything ready.

1072
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:22,919
The doctor is preparing
for an operation.

1073
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:24,749
You two had better leave.
We'll stay here.

1074
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:28,118
They want you too, pilot.

1075
01:03:29,585 --> 01:03:30,749
I can't help them.

1076
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:34,523
I know how you feel, son.

1077
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,560
How do you feel, John?

1078
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:38,971
Better.

1079
01:03:40,052 --> 01:03:42,005
But if it hadn't been for
that doctor I'd have ..

1080
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,250
He is a great guy.

1081
01:03:43,748 --> 01:03:45,090
I saw him a few minutes ago.

1082
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:47,493
He looked as if he needed
a doctor himself.

1083
01:03:49,444 --> 01:03:51,552
I am sure glad it isn't me
he is going to work on.

1084
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:52,876
You should be.

1085
01:03:53,505 --> 01:03:55,965
The doctor is too far gone
to tackle an operation.

1086
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:58,369
He'd probably fold up
in the middle of it.

1087
01:04:54,479 --> 01:04:55,838
Nurse, get me gown and gloves.

1088
01:04:58,016 --> 01:04:58,737
Jim!

1089
01:04:59,582 --> 01:05:01,049
That's alright, nurse.

1090
01:05:19,725 --> 01:05:20,880
Doris, gloves please.

1091
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:25,713
A crushing injury to the
frontal area of the skull.

1092
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,657
I've stopped the haemorrhage.

1093
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:30,277
But the pressure must
be relived immediately.

1094
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:54,761
The boy is going to be alright.

1095
01:05:56,922 --> 01:05:58,640
How did you two ever get together?

1096
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:01,150
Doris brought me out, Jim.

1097
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:05,667
Doctor, the other plane
hasn't arrived yet.

1098
01:06:05,767 --> 01:06:07,726
And some of those people
need immediate attention.

1099
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:08,989
I'll right with you.

1100
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,511
You take it easy, Dad.

1101
01:06:11,123 --> 01:06:11,881
We'll go.

1102
01:06:13,874 --> 01:06:14,757
Alright.

1103
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:16,529
<i>Doctor </i>Stanton.

1104
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:03,223
