1
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:21,305
They abandoned their homes
and crossed the deserts...

2
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,309
...carrying their children on
their backs...

3
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:30,382
And with their men they made
the Mexican Revolution.

4
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,180
<i>I'm going to sing a song...</i>

5
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:08,185
<i>... that everybody sings...</i>

6
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,189
<i>... about a woman from the</i>
<i>troop...</i>

7
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,262
<i>... who everybody knows.</i>

8
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,857
Who are you?

9
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,970
Villa's people.

10
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,962
Go ahead.

11
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,212
That's Antonio Zeta,
the colonel.

12
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,474
Colonel Zeta?

13
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,218
He had 600 men.
What happened?

14
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,248
<i>And in Conejos town...</i>

15
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,229
<i>... by a very calm street...</i>

16
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:57,234
<i>... comes the brave</i>
<i>Antonio Zeta...</i>

17
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,307
<i>... he's sad and beaten.</i>

18
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,013
What eyes that man has!

19
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,383
How can we live in peace with
so much anger?

20
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,335
<i>Poorpeople's blanket!</i>

21
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,338
<i>Killed for being brave!</i>

22
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,341
<i>He sang to St. Peter!</i>

23
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,344
<i>The soldier in frock coat!</i>

24
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,348
- Where's the quarter?
- Over there.

25
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,354
Hey!
Where are you from?

26
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,288
From the "Sabino".

27
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,359
We're the only left.

28
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,306
Look how's the Revolution here,
Colonel.

29
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,374
Yes.

30
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,479
Where do you go?

31
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,323
I look for Colonel Zuñiga.

32
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,394
Who are you?

33
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,328
- Antonio Zeta.
- Tell him.

34
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,399
Are you Colonel Antonio Zeta?

35
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,595
- Yes, I am.
- Come on in.

36
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,440
- Antonio Zeta?
- Yes.

37
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:27,543
So that guy is Antonio Zeta
with his "North Panthers"!

38
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,487
Colonel...

39
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,389
I waited for you at the "Sabino".

40
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,393
Don't tell me...
I didn't know it.

41
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,394
That's what I have left.

42
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,366
I started the attack thinking
you were coming.

43
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,369
My people died; women,
children...

44
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,301
Mendoza was killed at the
trap.

45
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,406
But you... why you didn't come?

46
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,512
Because I'd end up as Mendoza.

47
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,413
And colonel Villa's orders?

48
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,419
I learned about Mendoza and I
was getting ready for the...

49
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,489
...attack.
- Did you attack?

50
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,426
Well... there are no supplies.
I have few people.

51
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,688
You have few guts!

52
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,434
If I reply that, we'll die.

53
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,436
But my life's for the Revolution.

54
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,303
You're not such a soldier.

55
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,568
Captain... arrest him!

56
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:33,074
- What can I do?
- I won't turn this fight into...

57
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,119
...a vulgar argument.
- At your orders, Colonel.

58
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,257
Disarm him and take him.

59
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,592
We'll see...

60
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,492
We 'll see what
Mr. Carranza thinks about this.

61
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,562
He's my Major.

62
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,536
Look after the wounded.
Search a place to stay.

63
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,470
Let's see the guns, Major.

64
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,475
What guns? There are no
supplies.

65
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,546
I don't want any women here.

66
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,637
Soldier!
Follow the order!

67
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,484
All of you, women, get out
of here!

68
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,485
Take them away, Pascual.

69
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,523
Make them go with all
their stuff!

70
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,558
That one too!

71
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,497
- Don't take that!
- I obey the Colonel.

72
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:25,502
He said women; I'm a soldier of
the Major State. Go!

73
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,572
- OK.
- Hurry up!

74
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,509
I have news: Colonel
Zeta is about to arrive.

75
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,637
He's believed to be the devil.
He fought in Chihuahua and...

76
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,512
..."El Paredóón". He comes to
arrest Zuñiga; Villa ordered it.

77
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,676
Villa ordered it?

78
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,490
- He didn't say so.
- I did, but you didn't listen.

79
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:56,567
Move! Move, people! Here
comes your hurricane!

80
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,539
I know! Your "barrel".

81
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,544
Right. And give me a cognac
bottle. An expensive one.

82
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,547
- I want it here.
- On credit?

83
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,548
- Well...
- Oh, no!

84
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,552
Give it to her and
charge it to me!

85
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,555
This is made of gold, and
she's Mendez's!

86
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,558
- Isn't she?
- Lf you say so...

87
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,561
Don't grow hot. You'll grow
cold later!

88
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,561
That's right!

89
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,600
This gold doesn't buy
"La Cucaracha"!

90
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,635
Thank you!

91
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,640
Charge from here.
It's made of gold, too.

92
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,643
But don't forget the change.

93
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,604
Keep it so you stop being
heretic, so it takes care...

94
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,647
...of you.

95
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,585
Take care of me... I took it
from a dead soldier.

96
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,589
If he was that good and he
died, what do I want it for?

97
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,389
I don't trade with sacred
things...

98
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,529
I'll give you credit.

99
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,664
- "Trumpet"!
- Yes, chief.

100
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,865
At your orders.

101
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,605
Here's the bottle; defend
it with your life.

102
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,608
Let's see how much Colonel
Zeta can stand.

103
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,678
- OK.
- Who invites the drinks now?

104
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,578
That's how you pay for fun?

105
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,876
I'll pay you, Jacobo.

106
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,620
So I won't see you again.

107
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,625
The new colonel is finding
things out.

108
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,628
- So?
- He realized there are not...

109
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,698
...supplies here.
- So what?

110
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,597
So what?

111
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,633
You can't traffic
with the guns.

112
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,704
What's the matter?

113
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,640
What are you talking about?

114
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:47,644
Don't act dumb. You and the
other bastards hid the guns.

115
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,715
You were going to sell them
tonight, right?

116
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,618
Don't shiver; you'd better leave.

117
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,653
You give me the creeps.

118
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,722
Go away!

119
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,623
Mendez...

120
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,696
I want to talk to you.
Come with me.

121
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,638
You were right, Colonel.

122
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,642
The guns are here, but nobody
would say anything.

123
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,713
We may be standing over them.

124
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,647
What about Zuñiga
and the others?

125
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,718
They won't speak a word.

126
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,722
Our effort was in vain.

127
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,193
- The troop?
- It's a small and bad one.

128
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,661
People are fed up with it.

129
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,665
- And the woman?
- Well, let's say it this way:

130
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:47,670
She's a slut, that's why she's
called "The Cockroache".

131
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,671
- I don't understand.
- Yes...

132
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,677
Cockroaches are not fine with
a single male. They manage...

133
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,748
...to take other cockroaches'
males.

134
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,685
- Now what?
- We'll follow Villa's orders.

135
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,756
What if we don't find the guns?

136
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,492
We'll follow his orders!

137
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,707
<i>... give him some help...</i>

138
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,711
<i>... tell that man to come</i>
<i>on in...</i>

139
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
<i>Tell him to come, if he's a</i>
<i>real man!</i>

140
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,715
<i>... I want to know his</i>
<i>betrayals...</i>

141
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,721
<i>... if I have to know his name...</i>

142
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,725
<i>... l'll help him ifyou love him.</i>

143
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,729
"Cucaracha", why do you
take care of that bottle?

144
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,730
Take care of what
is important!

145
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,801
Where's your wife?

146
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,737
Whom is that cognac for?

147
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,707
Don't you know the news?
It's for the what's-his-name...

148
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,742
...of the what's-her-name.

149
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,746
Even the "Trumpet" is
guarding it.

150
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,077
What's-his-name's your dad,
what's-her-name's your mom...

151
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,852
The "Trumpet" is your
godmother!

152
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,545
What kind a person is one
with such relatives!

153
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,760
Chief, I don't think that
guy is coming. Maybe he...

154
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,831
...doesn't drink.
- I didn't say you could rest.

155
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:25,836
A meeting?

156
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,929
What's going on?

157
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,774
He doesn't drink.

158
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:33,977
Really?

159
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,852
I'm not the greatest man,
I don't want to be...

160
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,856
...but I order because I was
sent for that.

161
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,292
To triumph, you have to die.

162
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:54,525
Let's die quickly so others can
come back and work, so they...

163
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,301
...are not lazy.

164
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,806
I want you to understand...

165
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,879
...so we search the same goal,
the same way.

166
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,386
Trinidad...

167
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,455
...bring Zuñiga.

168
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:28,366
Melesio Lopez, Jacobo Mendez...
One step ahead.

169
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:34,304
Ricardo Zuñiga, Melesio Lopez
and Jacobo Mendez will be...

170
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,375
...shot now, for treachery.

171
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,914
You're in charge, Lieutenant.

172
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,350
Follow me.

173
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,856
Let me explain... I don't know
where the guns are.

174
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,857
Let me explain...

175
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,929
It's not fair, Colonel...

176
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,867
I don't understand you.

177
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,939
Maybe you like to lose.

178
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:13,877
Yes, sir. We can't enter by this
way, nor this one, nor that one.

179
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,948
There are no guns nor people.
They are in St. Blas.

180
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,884
If the point is dying, it'll be
easy.

181
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,888
You're right, Major. We'll go
over St. Blas tomorrow.

182
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,891
- The point's dying.
- Dying of laughter.

183
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,963
- With what guns?
- I said no women here.

184
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,905
By now, instead of soldiers
there are people of the town.

185
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,976
Call those who know how to
use a gun.

186
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,980
Walk. Come on, walk!

187
00:15:59,058 --> 00:15:59,990
Colonel!

188
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,222
I'm talking to you!

189
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,999
Why don't you kill me too?

190
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,299
Beacuse I'm not sure.

191
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,938
- Of my being guilty?
- Of your being a woman.

192
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,942
- Really?
- I don't kill women.

193
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,014
Colonel! The horse's ready.
It's the best I could get.

194
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,019
- Did you buy it?
- Well, I gave them a receipt.

195
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,021
A receipt...

196
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,959
- What do you do with women?
- He lectures them as with the...

197
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,962
...soldiers. Zeta knows how to
speak.

198
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,033
The only thing he knows!
He's not for this stuff.

199
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,970
Here, the Revolution isn't about
dying nor sowing the land.

200
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:51,975
Revolution is fighting and
and drinking: That's...

201
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,978
...the best part.
- Neither dying nor sowing.

202
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,982
People don't know about
lectures. They take a gun and...

203
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,985
...kill anyone in exchange
of a drink.

204
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,057
- Lf you don't kill, you die.
- Even worse: You don't eat.

205
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:14,065
The 2 mules I'm talking to are
busy.

206
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,000
Look, "Cucaracha"...

207
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,005
...I'm here to fight, that's what
I do. And you're here for...

208
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,008
...what you do.
- I don't think the colonel...

209
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,012
...likes what you do. Don't dress
like that. Why did you steal...

210
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:33,016
...the gringo's clothes?
Dress like a woman.

211
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,019
Excuse us, Coronel. Don't pay
heed to small things.

212
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,020
You waste your time.

213
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:44,027
Maybe the priest doesn't
know about the guns.

214
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:49,100
I'll take care of him. I'll
be in the church.

215
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,040
Drink some blessed water, not
my cognac!

216
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:01,112
I bought it to share it with you,
but now it's all mine!

217
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:06,049
He's such a "saint"! I can't make
him fall.

218
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,050
Don't you drink my cognac!

219
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,122
Walk! Walk!

220
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,125
For God's sake!

221
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,128
Don't take him away!

222
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:23,066
Calm down, lady. The boy is old
enough to die.

223
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,136
No, please.

224
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,075
Colonel!

225
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:38,081
I refuse to obey your orders.
I've never shot a gun and...

226
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,081
...I never won't.

227
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,083
I'll be a useless victim.

228
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,089
I'm with the Revolution, but not
for killing.

229
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,160
I can be of more use,
with my work. Let me explain.

230
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,098
But they are just children!

231
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,166
Colonel!

232
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,099
Gabriel!

233
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,201
Gabriel!

234
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,203
Gabriel!

235
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,510
Where's Gabriel?

236
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:54,157
Colonel, my husband, Gabriel
Puente... it's a mistake.

237
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:58,229
He's the teacher; he's been
taken with the other men!

238
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,165
Ask anyone. He's the teacher.

239
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,169
He teaches the children. He
can't kill. You're taking all...

240
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,173
...the men. What do you want
Gabriel for?

241
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,176
He can help Revolution in
another way.

242
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,244
I'm talking...

243
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,251
What do you want Gabriel for?

244
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,184
Don't go!

245
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,255
What will you ask God for?

246
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,259
Hypocrite!

247
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,499
You're Antonio Zeta...

248
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,277
I know what you come for.
I don't know about the guns.

249
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,213
Are you taking all men to
St. Blas?

250
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,285
- You need them all.
- I do.

251
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:12,303
Let me go on. My husband was
taken to the quarter. Please!

252
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,314
Gabriel!

253
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,318
Go home, ma'am.

254
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,330
Go! Go!

255
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,337
Bastard!

256
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,368
Come in, boys!

257
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:23,306
St. "Cucaracha" will make a
miracle. Don't go with the priest.

258
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,307
Let's see if he's that good...

259
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,379
There you are to spit on
St. Blas!

260
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,327
Yes...

261
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,398
The point was dying.

262
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,400
Where is he?

263
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,340
What are you waiting for?

264
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,344
What are you making a
bonfire for?

265
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,347
- Put out those bonfires!
- Don't you!

266
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,417
Do you want us to die sooner?

267
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:12,355
Forgive me, Captain, but those
are Colonel Zeta's orders.

268
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,359
- Where is he?
- You know where.

269
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,427
- Where?

270
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,433
Damn! Now we have to obey a
crazy man.

271
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,435
The bonfire!

272
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:04,441
We were supposed to take
St. Blas... where one dies.

273
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,408
Yes...

274
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,413
Only because they didn't
feel like...

275
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,484
...they didn't kill us all.

276
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,456
We knew it was insane to take
St. Blas.

277
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,494
But who understands now?

278
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,498
Sending us to this hole...

279
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,502
...so we are more visible.

280
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,504
And I say:

281
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,440
"Lord...

282
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,445
...send me back to my village.

283
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,448
- Don't be mean."
- Yes...

284
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:50,487
That'd be good. But He is
not here to endure all this.

285
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,524
Have you seen Mr. Gabriel?

286
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,458
Mr. José...

287
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,529
...have you?

288
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,468
Look...

289
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,473
...how gorgeous is that woman.

290
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,477
- She must be cold.
- Get close to her. Her husband...

291
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,477
...must be dead.

292
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:20,517
So, Felipe, you kill Zeta.
Hurry up! He's hard to get.

293
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,555
Take Meco in case Zeta goes
crazy.

294
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,492
No, you'd better not. First,
go for Ventura.

295
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,562
He may not agreed.

296
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,500
Have you seen the "Trumpet"?

297
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:42,505
Bear it, love, bear it.
You'll soon have it.

298
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,508
- You'll see.
- Why did you bring her here?

299
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,512
She's a soldier. She must go
wherever her man goes!

300
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,512
She's not like other women.

301
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,518
She's new. She doesn't know.
But she will endure this.

302
00:25:55,654 --> 00:26:00,523
I'm leaving. I have to watch
over. I'll be right back!

303
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,523
I wish...

304
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,528
- It must be a boy.
- What for? It'd better die.

305
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,529
It's not your baby!

306
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:12,535
Look. They'll fight and won't
know who killed them.

307
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:17,540
Or they'll grow old in misery.
What will life give this child?

308
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,076
Chief!

309
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,614
You were right. The thing will
happen soon; there's much...

310
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,613
...noise up there.

311
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,621
They are so sad, look.

312
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,559
Look, "Trumpet", get all the
drinks you can. Hurry up!

313
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,627
Yes, chief.

314
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,568
Shut up, women!
Instead of being here, go to...

315
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,571
...cheer your men up.
- We won't get it, not even...

316
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,575
...being naked!
- Lf you don't move, the sun...

317
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,645
...will burn you.

318
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,541
Where are you going?

319
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,619
Come heat them up; you have
a pretty face.

320
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,594
Gabriel! Honey!

321
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,665
Honey!

322
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,599
You're not...

323
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,604
...you're not Mr. Gabriel.
- I'm not, but if you want me to...

324
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,607
...that's OK.
- Why do you have his blanket?

325
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,610
- It was a present.
- It's my husband's!

326
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:31,614
A sleepy-eyed fancy man?

327
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,617
- Yes.
- He doesn't need it any more.

328
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:39,622
He remained stiff, looking at
the sky, and for a long time.

329
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,660
- No, no!
- Yes! He got a shot in the head.

330
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,698
Oh, my God!

331
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:54,637
Calm down! Stop your whining!
If you lose your man, find...

332
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,640
...another one. You'd better
find him soon!

333
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,610
- Poor woman!
- Nothing will change here.

334
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,648
- You're right.
- Chief! Here 's the "fury".

335
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,716
Hand it out.

336
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:18,627
We go with the people, and as
soon as hearing the shoots...

337
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:23,632
...raise that rag very high.
I think Zeta is crazy.

338
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,736
- That's it.
- No.

339
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,639
This won't be their hole, as
they've planned.

340
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,711
Zeta didn't fool us; let's be
straight.

341
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,749
If he gets crazy, I'll take
care.

342
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,652
- But you won't betray him.
- Lf you say so.

343
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,656
<i>We pretended to be garbage...</i>

344
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:53,731
<i>... a hurricane came and</i>
<i>lifted us...</i>

345
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,736
<i>... and we were flying high.</i>

346
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,674
<i>I'd like to be a worthy pearl</i>
<i>for your earrings...</i>

347
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:13,683
<i>... to bite your little ear</i>
<i>and kiss your cheeks.</i>

348
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:18,755
<i>Why are you so pretty that</i>
<i>you drive me crazy?</i>

349
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,760
<i>Passion rules my heart...</i>

350
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,765
This was called Demetrio Luna.

351
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,894
He lived far away.

352
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:42,779
Come on. Come and help me;
my back aches.

353
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,782
These deads are a nuisance.

354
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,721
OK, but... who will bury us
tomorrow?

355
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,722
- I can see...
- Shut up.

356
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,794
Hey, guys, here we have fire!

357
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,741
<i>If I drink tequila today...</i>

358
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,969
<i>... l'll drink sherry tomorrow...</i>

359
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,812
Colonel!

360
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:18,814
Colonel!

361
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:23,752
Here they come, Colonel, they
come in a hurry!

362
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:27,824
That's what the fire was for.
We're sorrounded by federals.

363
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:33,762
The "Cucaracha" spoiled the
people, they are very drunk.

364
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:38,767
- I don't know what you can do.
- Go back to your position.

365
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,768
Let's hope God helps us.

366
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:41,837
OK, Colonel.

367
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,841
Colonel Zeta...

368
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:53,782
We agreed not to follow your
orders. We'll be an easy target...

369
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:57,854
...with those bonfires, and
people don't want to fight.

370
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,858
We'll leave as soon as the
enemy attacks.

371
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:09,866
With all respect, Colonel, I'll
take care of your reaction.

372
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,872
You're late.

373
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,809
The people is ready to fight.

374
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:21,877
Listen to them.

375
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:33,890
...biting your ear and
kissing your cheeks.

376
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,894
You are the kind of person...

377
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,830
...who takes the fortress
or dies trying.

378
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,831
But those damned bonfires...

379
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,902
I need your help, Captain.

380
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,903
Help me.

381
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,838
You'll soon know why we die.

382
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,909
Tell me what you think.

383
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,845
I say to myself:

384
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:02,851
"Zeta is a sincere man, and he's
a soldier. He doesn't let...

385
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,922
...his people die without
a reason."

386
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,926
You can count on me, Colonel.

387
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:11,927
Come here.

388
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,865
It's time, guys!

389
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:18,900
They're coming!

390
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,937
The federals are coming!

391
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,874
The federals of St. Blas
are coming!

392
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,875
Where is Colonel Zeta?

393
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,877
Glorify my soul, Lord.

394
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,879
- Has the baby been born?
- No.

395
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:32,880
He won't be born!

396
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:33,881
Why?

397
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:34,916
There are many!

398
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,884
And more keep coming.

399
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,079
He won't be born!

400
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:41,957
Don't worry.

401
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:58,974
Move.

402
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:30,998
Stop it!

403
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,000
Stop it! Stop it!

404
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,071
Don't you kill each other!

405
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,073
No!

406
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,077
No! No!

407
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,174
What time is it?

408
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:53,089
Don't cry, "Chipotle". I'll
give you weed so you sleep...

409
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,093
Come on.

410
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,029
"Trumpet"!

411
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,100
Don't die, "Trumpet"!

412
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,035
There's a lot to do!

413
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,043
- Chief!
- You're screwed.

414
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,043
Kill them!

415
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,047
Kill them! Kill them!

416
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,047
There's no supply!

417
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,051
Tell them some swearwords!
They hurt too!

418
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,121
Federals are sons of!

419
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,135
Gabriel!

420
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,140
Gabriel! Gabriel!

421
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,075
- Stop crying and let's go!
- No!

422
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,077
No! No!

423
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,149
Don't refuse it! Hold her!

424
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,809
Come here! We're here to...

425
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,185
...be killed!

426
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,169
Retiring?

427
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,266
What time is it?

428
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:27,183
Right now we're taking
St. Blas, boys!

429
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,187
General Villa is entering
St. Blas!

430
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,129
That's what we're dying for.

431
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,133
Time! Time!

432
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,134
We should be killed when...

433
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,203
...Villa entered.

434
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,208
You've given me a good
lesson, Colonel!

435
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,211
Come here, Sergeant!

436
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,155
It's time, people! Hurray for
the Revolution...

437
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,258
...let's enjoy it!

438
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:44,760
Ma'am, I...

439
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,765
I'm not important here.

440
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,768
There are better men.

441
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:53,769
I'm a soldier.

442
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,706
I'd like you to allow me...

443
00:37:58,843 --> 00:37:59,775
...to talk to you.

444
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:02,778
You're alone.

445
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,715
You haven't chosen any
men yet...

446
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,785
If you wished...

447
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,726
Sorry for having thought...

448
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,730
That one is gorgeous.
Look at it.

449
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,801
No, no. I like that one.

450
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,734
It's expensive.

451
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,736
Well... you're right.

452
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,738
So you don't want to buy it?

453
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,864
Not at that price.

454
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:32,737
Give me 20.

455
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:33,741
20 pesos?

456
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,743
I wouldn't be here if
I had them.

457
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,815
Take it. I'll buy the shawl.

458
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,751
Take it, ma'am.

459
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:44,752
A present.

460
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,756
Don't think about it, ma'am.
Take it.

461
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,757
Give it to the Colonel...

462
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,828
...for one of his lovers.

463
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,762
I didn't mean to offend you.

464
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,764
No, of course you didn't.

465
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,766
But keep your shawl...

466
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,768
...as I kept my cognac.

467
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,839
This is not enough for me.

468
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,843
You couldn't be my boyfriend.

469
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:09,777
Then what?

470
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,779
Well, I take the cotorina.

471
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,851
The cheapest one.
With my own money.

472
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,351
Don't be mean.

473
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,286
I just want you to like me.

474
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,288
It won't be easy.

475
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,290
You have to give me flowers.

476
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,292
I'll give you flowers.

477
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,294
To my grave, when I die!

478
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,366
You won't ever get
me to like you.

479
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,375
Give it to me.

480
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,353
Who is it?

481
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,424
Who else? It's me.

482
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,358
I brought some presents.

483
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,429
Go away. The door's closed.

484
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,366
I couldn't wait until you die...

485
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,367
I said: "I'd better go now."

486
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,436
Here you are.

487
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,375
And cognac, if you want
to share it.

488
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,445
And the 20-peso shawl.

489
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:52,413
I only ask once.

490
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,381
I ask many times.

491
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,383
I've only asked twice.

492
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,385
I said it wouldn't be easy.

493
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,387
I don't want your flowers...

494
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,422
...nor your bottle...

495
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,389
...nor your shawl.

496
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,391
But you liked the shawl...

497
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,392
...you look nice.

498
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,461
Don't touch me.

499
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,395
Accept it.

500
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:09,396
Let me go!

501
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,465
Accept it.

502
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,446
Don't you ever hit a man.

503
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,514
Never!

504
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,530
Take your clothes off.

505
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,531
You'll be a woman.

506
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,526
Your clothes off!

507
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,027
What's up?

508
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:24,032
I'm fine, Colonel.
We're here, fighting.

509
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,102
St. Blas is nice, right?

510
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,035
Ready?

511
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,106
Wait a minute.

512
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,042
Ready?

513
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,111
Yes.

514
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,113
Don't move.

515
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,048
Very nice!

516
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,117
Thanks.

517
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,052
Enjoy your meal, Captain.

518
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,123
The same for you, Colonel.

519
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:56,064
When I was a kid, I liked
eating flavored ice.

520
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,134
Then buy some ice for me.

521
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:11,703
I like your eyes.

522
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,651
They were dark before.

523
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,654
They looked wild.

524
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,590
They were shining last night.

525
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,591
Now they're calm.

526
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:25,717
They're laughing.

527
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,671
Your eyes never looked
like that.

528
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,678
I'll love you very much.

529
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,614
Do you remember when
I laughted at you?

530
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,682
I did it again.

531
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,614
I wanted you to see me.

532
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,618
But you didn't do it.

533
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,622
That's why I bought the cognac.

534
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,625
I didn't have another way to
express...

535
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,695
...that I wanted to be with you.

536
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,632
You know?

537
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,634
I wished to die...

538
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,638
...so you suffered seeing
me dead.

539
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,708
It's good I didn't die!

540
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,016
Antonio Zeta.
Nobody is called Zeta.

541
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,019
You have a nice name.

542
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,021
You know?

543
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:32,028
Though I've been with many
men, you're the one.

544
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,035
I'm going to love you much.

545
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,038
Yes.

546
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,045
Now take your ice.

547
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:59,022
<i>I'm in love with a woman...</i>

548
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:05,960
<i>... I feel better only</i>
<i>when I'm drunk...</i>

549
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,963
<i>... with much wine...</i>

550
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:13,035
<i>... to wander.</i>

551
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:22,044
<i>And if you were nice to me...</i>

552
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:31,054
<i>... you'd have my protection...</i>

553
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,987
What a pretty woman.

554
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,092
And so reserved.

555
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,062
They call her widow, but
she's a lady.

556
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,063
Yes.

557
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,067
And she's hard to get.

558
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,001
She doesn't pay heel to anyone.

559
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,072
Nobody gets close to her.

560
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,082
Don't hate me.

561
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,087
I don't order. I just follow
orders.

562
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,023
And I have to obey them.

563
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,094
Without knowing faces,
nor names.

564
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,028
I'm sorry for what I did.

565
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,032
If I could give you back what
I took...

566
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,102
...I would so you don't cry.

567
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,198
I was given this.

568
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,043
I was given these cents as...

569
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,115
...a compensation for my
husband's death.

570
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,121
I think he betrayed himself.

571
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,056
He didn't want to kill.

572
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,060
He could have given a great
service.

573
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,060
As a teacher.

574
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,132
But you didn't listen to him.

575
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,133
Where is he?

576
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,070
Among all those unknown...

577
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,072
...dead people.

578
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,074
Don't think about that.

579
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,076
We're not here to listen...

580
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,148
We'll listen to other people
later.

581
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,151
Now, it's all about dying.

582
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,154
That's unfortunately true.

583
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,159
Conejos town was occupied by
federals.

584
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,092
They burnt it.

585
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,094
You can't go there.

586
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,165
We'll leave in 2 weeks.

587
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,102
I'll stay in St. Blas.

588
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,103
Be with us.

589
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,174
We need women like you.

590
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,179
Take care.

591
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,185
If you need something...

592
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,186
...let me know.

593
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,203
<i>The Cockroach...</i>

594
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:07,209
<i>... the Cockroach has died...</i>

595
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:13,215
No. Now she's being born.
She'll be a soldier.

596
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,022
It's the first time I see you as
a woman. How does it feel?

597
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:28,256
Get another husband and you'll
know.

598
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:38,172
Children, don't snoop the
teacher's widow!

599
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,242
Come here!

600
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:05,265
Look, "Cucaracha", hats have
other uses besides protecting!

601
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,276
The lady has good manners,
right, Colonel?

602
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,296
- I was about to go with you.
- I wanted to hurry.

603
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,232
Maybe you don't take your hat
for me.

604
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,235
Don't say so. I love you.

605
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:45,239
- But she... is a lady.
- And what about me?

606
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,311
You're my woman. Why do you
want me to flatter you?

607
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,247
- You're right.
- I'll be out some days.

608
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,250
- I'll receive orders.
- I go with you.

609
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,321
No. You know you have to wait
for me.

610
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,325
OK, Colonel, but don't be away
too long.

611
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,362
- Give me a blasthole, quickly.
- I want a bullet.

612
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,366
Take it. Give me the
blasthole.

613
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,378
Here come the federals!

614
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:02,316
Hey, don't mess with her.
There's no man to protect her.

615
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,956
She must look for one. She has
tricks to find him.

616
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,392
Maybe she doesn't like men,
"Cucaracha".

617
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,757
Why do you insult me?

618
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,328
Why do you care about me?

619
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,330
Don't lecture me!

620
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,401
I do what I want!

621
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,407
Everybody knows that.

622
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,842
You have to be smart to find a
good man...

623
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,851
Look for him. Don't take
what is...

624
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:37,851
...not yours!

625
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,853
You're in the church.

626
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,857
My ass! Go look for a man.

627
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,929
I don't know how. I'm not a
slut.

628
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,866
That's how easy women are
called.

629
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,937
And good-for-nothing women
are called mules!

630
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,872
Here, you have to fight.

631
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,033
Don't be finicky.

632
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,878
- You defend your job.
- You do the same!

633
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,881
Were you crying for your man?
The Revolution...

634
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,882
...gives you a new one!

635
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,884
There are many out there.

636
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,956
Some are more useful than
your guy.

637
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:15,889
No one.

638
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,962
My husband was the worthiest
man.

639
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,896
But I pleased you...

640
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,968
...if the man I like wouldn't
have an owner.

641
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,903
Though his owner is nothing
but a...

642
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,907
Take him away!
Come on, do it!

643
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,908
With whatever you have.

644
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,910
What I have is much for you...

645
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:37,979
...soldier woman.

646
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:03,005
<i>I lost my peace of mind...</i>

647
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:12,015
<i>... because of a mean woman...</i>

648
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:14,441
It was a hard day.

649
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,250
Yes. Go and tell the people.

650
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,321
We have some hours to sleep.

651
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,324
Good night, Colonel.

652
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:32,266
<i>... since she didn't have</i>
<i>feelings...</i>

653
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:37,339
<i>... and she was a bad woman...</i>

654
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:44,278
<i>... she went away with my love...</i>

655
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:49,351
<i>... for ever more.</i>

656
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,989
Give a bottle, Sr. Cosme.

657
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,058
Yes, Colonel.

658
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,064
- Is it him?

659
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,005
Valentín Razo wants to meet
a Antonio Zeta...

660
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,006
...and drink with him.

661
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,041
At your service.

662
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,077
I'd better serve and
you drink.

663
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,013
Why?

664
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,084
Just because I want to.

665
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:30,024
No, don't go. I want to drink
on behalf of coincidences.

666
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,025
Both of us are Villa's
colonels.

667
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,097
Both are famous for being
true men.

668
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,030
And both of us...

669
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,102
...have known the same woman.

670
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,036
She might not remember me...

671
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,037
But I...

672
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,108
...still feel her taste
in my mouth.

673
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,120
Congratulations, Mr. Zeta.

674
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,054
If I didn't respect you...

675
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,126
...I'd ask you to share
her with me.

676
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,130
Your words are not good.

677
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,134
Your words may cause your
death.

678
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,142
He didn't fall in the trap.

679
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,080
That man's dangerous,
Colonel.

680
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,377
Don't mess with him.

681
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,085
I am the dangerous one!

682
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:36,158
He has my woman, and he
doesn't want to fight for her.

683
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,168
How could I love her?

684
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,105
Excuse my anger. Major.

685
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,176
Have some drinks with me.

686
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,181
You know, I'm bewithched.

687
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,115
I came following her.

688
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,184
I dream of her.

689
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,119
I prefer her dead before...

690
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,121
...seeing her with another
man.

691
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,122
And I find her...

692
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:13,195
...engaged with another man!
And look who is it.

693
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,132
I spoke with fury.

694
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,203
I can't regret now.

695
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,140
The truth is that this colonel
seems to be...

696
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,208
...very brave.

697
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,379
And now...

698
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,216
...I'm compromised.

699
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,245
What a nice shawl!

700
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,248
It looks so nice on you!

701
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,193
It's good you're here.

702
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,264
I waited for you forever.

703
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,357
What did you do?

704
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,270
I met a man called
Valentin Razo.

705
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,328
He's a tough man.

706
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,273
Hard talk.

707
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,208
He seems to be dangerous.

708
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,210
I think you know him.

709
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,211
Why?

710
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,283
It looks like you hurt him.

711
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,284
Valentin Razo.

712
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,345
I don't know him.

713
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,297
What happened?

714
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,301
Nothing. I broke a glass.

715
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,313
My cross.

716
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,316
Your cross.

717
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,322
Colonel Zeta...

718
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,326
I've been following that woman.

719
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,331
She promised to come back
with me.

720
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,332
This is the man.

721
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,338
Valentin Razo is apologizing
for what he did.

722
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,275
Don't just keep my words,
Colonel Zeta!

723
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,346
I can't keep the humiliation!

724
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,351
I didn't remember him.

725
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,285
Don't keep that mean woman...

726
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,356
...without sorting things out!

727
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,290
You took her from me...

728
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,361
That's not right.

729
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,296
But now you can face me.

730
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,297
I'm here.

731
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,368
I'm waiting for you,
Colonel!

732
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,302
You're a man.

733
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,138
I'm a man too.

734
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,210
Try to prove you're more
man than me.

735
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,218
You took advantage once.

736
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:24,283
Now come down!

737
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,153
Come down, here!

738
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,225
Let's kill each other!
Come on!

739
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:37,698
Shame on him.

740
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,902
Or shame on me.

741
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:46,607
Yes.

742
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,598
<i>Take this bouquet...</i>

743
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,599
<i>... of fresh flowers...</i>

744
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:58,673
<i>... taken from the field.</i>

745
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,610
<i>Tell me if you have...</i>

746
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,611
<i>... a new love...</i>

747
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:10,685
<i>... so I won't be in your way.</i>

748
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,716
Don't get angry, Colonel.

749
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,719
She doesn't deserve a thought.

750
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,727
Well, I say so.

751
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,735
Keep it, please.

752
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:10,744
A drink?

753
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:14,748
OK.

754
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:23,757
Thank you.

755
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,788
I'm glad you came with us,
ma'am.

756
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,723
My name is Isabel.

757
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,792
Isabel.

758
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:17,744
<i>The three of them walked</i>
<i>in silence...</i>

759
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,749
<i>... they were thinking...</i>

760
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:27,754
<i>... while the blind destiny...</i>

761
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:33,829
<i>... was weaving a new plot.</i>

762
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:25,879
What?

763
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:29,815
I almost died.

764
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:33,888
When that man yelled at you
and you went to kill him.

765
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,226
Then I waited for you.

766
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,327
That man died...

767
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,398
...for loving her.

768
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,333
Don't you say "that man".

769
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,404
You didn't know him.

770
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,338
I don't care if he died!

771
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,340
You don't forgive yourself.

772
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,342
Why do you blame me and...

773
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,344
...treat me like a trash?

774
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,413
I don't.

775
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,348
It's my guilt for not having...

776
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,350
...forgiven Valentin Razo.

777
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:05,454
You should have.

778
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,354
Do you feel that bad?

779
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,356
And the ones you killed before?

780
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,391
I remember them.

781
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,360
But they died for the
Revolution.

782
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,431
And this one died for a woman.

783
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,365
When Valentin Razo died...

784
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,367
...the air uncombed his hair.

785
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:24,371
Then I imaged you the way
I like...

786
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,374
...waiting for me, wrapped
in your shawl.

787
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,444
And I felt ashamed.

788
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:34,448
I love you.

789
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,453
But I feel I must stop
loving you.

790
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:42,456
You can leave.

791
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,487
Pay attention to me.

792
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:17,492
You prepare the food and I
sing for you.

793
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:22,497
And when in war, you can
carry my gun.

794
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,500
And I can shoot.

795
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,436
What the hell! I like you and
you like me.

796
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,437
All of those things...

797
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,439
...are not that easy.

798
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:37,512
Easy? Just looking at you all
is easy.

799
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:04,472
<i>A night and calm night...</i>

800
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:07,842
Thank you for having come.

801
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,776
Sometimes one feels cornered...

802
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,847
...and words are good.

803
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,044
I always remember when you
caressed me...

804
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,785
...there, in the church.

805
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:23,858
...when I most needed someone
to be nice to me.

806
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,861
I felt your hands in my hair.

807
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:29,955
The first caress...

808
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,867
...since that awful battle.

809
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,873
Your hand in my hair.

810
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:46,812
Why do you betray me?

811
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,814
You're not worthy any more.

812
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,819
You leave me alone and
then you treat me bad.

813
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,820
You aren't worth it.

814
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,891
You're not a loyal man.

815
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,825
But you have bad habits!

816
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:02,829
You're not woman enough
for me!

817
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,899
You're a cheap slut.

818
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,914
This pigsty makes me sick!

819
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,854
I lied to you, Colonel.

820
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,856
I don't care about her rage.

821
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:32,858
I don't care if she cries.

822
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,929
I want her away from here.

823
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,932
Away from you.

824
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:54,983
I've been alone...

825
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,952
...among all these men...

826
01:10:59,021 --> 01:10:59,953
...day after day...

827
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,958
...and neverending nights.

828
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,962
I don't want more Ioneliness.

829
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,902
Don't listen to me, Colonel.

830
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,904
I had to say it because I...

831
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,009
...have got used to this way
of living.

832
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:24,978
As you wished.

833
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,982
I beg you not to hear me.

834
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,987
I wish I could be a soldier.

835
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,990
But I'm a strange here...

836
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,993
...even for you, Colonel.

837
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:43,997
Let me go.

838
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,002
I appreciate you allowed
me to stay.

839
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,005
But I can't stay any more.

840
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:55,009
I can't do it.

841
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:05,185
Women!

842
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:13,961
<i>If you love me, I know how</i>
<i>to love...</i>

843
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:21,025
<i>... if you forget me, I know</i>
<i>how to forget.</i>

844
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:26,973
<i>But I have one single pride...</i>

845
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:32,979
<i>... and I don't know how to beg.</i>

846
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,982
<i>Oh!</i>

847
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:41,988
<i>The shoe that I throw away...</i>

848
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:48,996
<i>... I won't everpick up again.</i>

849
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,998
Oh, oh, oh!

850
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:55,069
Give me another bottle,
Martin!

851
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:59,005
Hey, you! Sing with your heart!

852
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:03,077
They are not singing to you,
but to me!

853
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,011
I want you to sing that Zeta...

854
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,013
...is the worst man of all.

855
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,014
The worst...

856
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,018
But I don't know any song with
that topic!

857
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:15,021
He's such a bastard! He doesn't
have a song.

858
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:19,025
Mr. Boni, let's make a toast
against them.

859
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,026
Against who?

860
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,097
Against men, of course.

861
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,031
Or against pigs. It's the same!

862
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,033
But I'm a man too!

863
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,037
Only in your memories, old man!

864
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:32,037
Drink it!

865
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:36,042
Let's see if you get
the insult over!

866
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,043
You too, Lola.

867
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,047
We'll dedicate another song to...

868
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,048
...that treacherous man!

869
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:47,121
OK. Let's hope your Colonel
goes to hell!

870
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:50,123
My Colonel...

871
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:56,130
That bastard is now with
that slut.

872
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,064
I think it's strange.

873
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,065
What?

874
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,067
That you just left him go.

875
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,138
When have I begged?

876
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,072
It hurts you, you can tell.

877
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,076
I've been hurt by his actions.
But him...

878
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,144
I don't care!

879
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,082
To those who don't like
anything at all...

880
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:20,086
Hey, pretty! If you're going
to flirt, start with me!

881
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,087
I'm tired of your talking...

882
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:25,091
...of that Zeta all the time!

883
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,161
I don't like the "Zeta" nor
you!

884
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,097
Let's see, bastards...

885
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,168
Silence me if you dare!

886
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,103
So why do we fight?

887
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,172
No, no.

888
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,206
Was it real or a dream?

889
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,208
Hey, answer!

890
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,211
Was it real?

891
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,213
What?

892
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,149
I said a lot of lies...

893
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,151
...about a man that I love.

894
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,153
It was true, sister.

895
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,224
Don't believe it, Lola.

896
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,227
He's not like I told you.

897
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:36,230
He's a real man.

898
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,233
And I have him here.

899
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,170
I see clear now.

900
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,241
He took me high.

901
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:51,245
He made me forget about
myself.

902
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,180
I didn't appreciate it.

903
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,182
Don't sleep, Lola!

904
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,253
I need you to hear me.

905
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,254
I hear you.

906
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,259
I'm nothing but trash.

907
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,265
Can you see the trash
that I am?

908
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:15,269
There's something good inside
of me.

909
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:20,467
I'm having a child.

910
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,210
A child of Antonio Zeta.

911
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:28,282
No one can take it from me.

912
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,287
He's got nothing from me.

913
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,291
Well, he has a golden cross.

914
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,295
But I have his child.

915
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,299
I want it to be like its dad.

916
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,302
With brave eyes.

917
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:53,273
With a tough voice when
angry.

918
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:56,310
Sometimes smooth.

919
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,315
I'll love it very much.

920
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,318
I'll apologize.

921
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:13,327
I'll dream a while, Lola.

922
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,864
Where are you going,
"soldier"?

923
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,365
I'll fire you!

924
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:55,369
Don't tell me, "Colonel".

925
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,372
My cross!

926
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,378
Did you get my cross?

927
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,312
Laugh now!

928
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:09,314
Like in the church.
Remember?

929
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:10,383
Laugh!

930
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:12,420
Give me my cross!

931
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,316
Keep that bastard!

932
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,391
I'm ashamed of having his
baby.

933
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,324
His?

934
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:20,393
Or the troop's?

935
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:34,339
Colonel.

936
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,341
Why did you come back?

937
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,343
I know Carranza didn't order...

938
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,412
...this march.

939
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:43,349
Let me mention that I follow
Carranza.

940
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,350
I follow orders, given by...

941
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,351
...Pancho Villa.

942
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:49,355
If the chiefs don't get along,
they will.

943
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,425
That's not my business.

944
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,426
Go ahead.

945
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,365
Your women are fighting,
Colonel!

946
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,366
Colonel, you want me to...

947
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,368
Go in front of the column.

948
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:04,437
OK, Colonel!

949
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:40,474
Kill her, "Cucaracha", kill her!

950
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:44,409
Don't be scared. I was...

951
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:45,478
...going to fight.

952
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:51,417
Hey, gossiping women!
They are far. Let's go.

953
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:52,485
Let's go!

954
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,459
Don't be sorry!

955
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:01,391
Finished?

956
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:04,430
Because I'll go with
Antonio Zeta right now.

957
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:05,430
Beat it!

958
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:06,499
Beat it!

959
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,516
Is this yours?

960
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:24,517
A bullet!

961
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,525
Do you cry because you lost?

962
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,533
For you.

963
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:44,538
No, I wanted a bullet!

964
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,444
<i>The dust of the road sounds...</i>

965
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:57,517
<i>... in the horse's caskets.</i>

966
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:02,488
<i>An unfinished love...</i>

967
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:08,529
<i>... goes away crying.</i>

968
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:11,564
Horse!

969
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,547
This is Villa's order.

970
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:34,554
Read it, please.

971
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:47,566
Read it.

972
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,504
"Colonel Antonio Zeta...

973
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:56,509
...march to Zacatecas against
Carranza's will right now.

974
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,512
Gather some loyal people and
reach me there.

975
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:03,584
Regard Carranza's followers as
traitors to the Revolution."

976
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:07,588
Signed by General Francisco
Villa.

977
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:14,594
Antonio!

978
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:19,532
You taught me to shoot, to
fight without fear for the...

979
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:24,537
...Revolution, to understand it.
But this is not a revolution!

980
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:28,541
If you follow that order, there
will be a slaughter here.

981
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,611
Antonio, break that paper!

982
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,616
I'll obey the order.

983
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:01,574
I understand he ordered you to
kill me.

984
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,644
Or I should kill you.

985
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:07,648
- That's what I understood.
- You misunderstood.

986
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,584
I need Villa's orders to be
followed.

987
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,588
If you're with Carranza, go away
with your people.

988
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:18,659
Because this place is mine,
Captain Ventura.

989
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,684
I don't know who's right.

990
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:48,621
But I know that, with
Villa or Carranza...

991
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,691
...we have to take Zacatecas.

992
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,692
I think...

993
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,627
...you're the best Colonel.

994
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,629
Hurray!

995
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,700
Hurray!

996
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:05,706
To Zacatecas!

997
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,652
This is the good one.

998
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,723
May God be with us.

999
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:44,677
<i>The eagle's already flown...</i>

1000
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:49,682
<i>... the nopal is alone.</i>

1001
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:54,687
<i>The fruit ofher love...</i>

1002
01:24:54,823 --> 01:25:00,762
<i>... is now forgotten.</i>

1003
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,435
Please...

1004
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,774
...it must have been born
by now.

1005
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:15,775
Help me.

1006
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:18,778
Come here.

1007
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,806
It comes in a bad position.

1008
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:47,807
It will die.

1009
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,314
What do you want it for?

1010
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:59,820
So it knows the sun...

1011
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:01,821
...the cold.

1012
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:09,762
- So it runs in the plain.
- What'll misery give your child?

1013
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:13,766
It'll live a bad life... if he's
not already dead.

1014
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,767
I don't care if I die.

1015
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:17,838
It must be alive.

1016
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:23,776
- It must be alive.
- There's no remedy.

1017
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:27,848
We must pull it out; otherwise,
you may die too.

1018
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:33,786
I'll give you anything, whatever
you want, but it must be alive.

1019
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:35,856
Endure this!

1020
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:43,863
Shut up!

1021
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,867
Hold something!

1022
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,772
Endure it!

1023
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:58,710
Here comes Pancho Villa!

1024
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,881
Hurray for the Revolution!

1025
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:28,909
- Where's the priest?
- Wait.

1026
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:43,958
What can I say?

1027
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:46,625
I don't know.

1028
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:52,933
I never lit any candle for you.
What for?

1029
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,936
Everything was just a sin.

1030
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:58,870
But I didn't know.

1031
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,941
You know I didn't.

1032
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,945
You know what happened.

1033
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,951
Forgive me, God.

1034
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:12,952
Forgive me.

1035
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,957
I brought my child to you.

1036
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,964
- Good morning, father.
- Good morning.

1037
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:26,057
Baptise my child.

1038
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:27,899
Yes.

1039
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:28,900
Let's see.

1040
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:31,972
He's old. Why didn't you
bring him before?

1041
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:33,905
I was...

1042
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,909
I was ashamed of coming to
the church.

1043
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:41,914
I come from far. His father
will pass by here, and I want...

1044
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,917
...him to know the baby.
He doesn't know him.

1045
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,987
It's good you came.

1046
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:50,789
Father...

1047
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,994
...he comes with another
woman.

1048
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:57,998
I knew about that before,
but now...

1049
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,935
Don't worry. I'll baptise him,
and you'll show him to his...

1050
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:05,005
...father.
What will his name be?

1051
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:08,008
Antonio, I baptise you.

1052
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:20,952
Here he comes, father.

1053
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:23,023
Thank you very much.

1054
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,963
Is this Colonel Zeta's troop?

1055
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,034
Is this Colonel Zeta's troop?

1056
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:38,038
- Is this Colonel Zeta's troop?
- General.

1057
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:40,335
He died at Zacatecas.

1058
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:39,031
<i>Here it ends the song...</i>

1059
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:45,037
<i>... that I sang for the</i>
<i>"Cucaracha".</i>

1060
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,040
AND WITH THEIR MEN AND
THEIR CHILDREN...

1061
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:51,043
...THEY MADE
THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION.
