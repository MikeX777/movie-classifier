Director

26
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:48,174
The film is dedicated
to our well-drillers who,

27
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:53,360
through their heroic work, provide our
homeland with incomparable riches.

28
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,300
Damned be this region!

29
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:25,711
They say elephants go to their
graveyard when they're ready to die.

30
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:27,528
Cars come here, to Ursei.

31
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,860
May this one rest in peace!

32
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:34,718
I'm sorry, you'll have to continue on foot.

33
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,625
But the trust is not that far from here.

34
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,564
About 3 kilometers.

35
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,875
On foot?

36
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:48,303
All alone?

37
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:53,353
I might get a lift.

38
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:56,745
It's useless to wait,
cars seldom pass by here.

39
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:01,485
Go across the hill!
It's shorter.

40
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:20,012
When you get there, tell the center
that we got a flat by the cemetery.

41
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,884
- They know where exactly.
- I will call them.

42
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,432
Good day!

43
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:36,879
<i>A strange creature
appeared in front of me.</i>

44
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,264
<i>A ghost of these abandoned oil wells,</i>

45
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,156
<i>that are decades old.</i>

46
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,862
I've been here for 50 years.

47
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,612
And so's Marioara...

48
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,600
This is Marioara.

49
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,889
But she's almost out of use,
she barely drips.

50
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,795
That one over there is Rodica.

51
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,367
Over here, oil wells have names.

52
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,800
That one there

53
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:06,886
is V. Stoinescu.

54
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:09,216
V...

55
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:14,538
That silent one is number 106.

56
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,600
A rotten well
only has a number.

57
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:25,461
And not a drop of oil, either.
Not even enough to light a lamp.

58
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,271
Haven't they retired you, old man?

59
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,985
You'd think I'd accept retirement?

60
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,966
I'll die along with them.
Very soon.

61
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:43,836
Is the city close?

62
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:47,107
Walk up to the monument,

63
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:49,526
and then go past the train station.

64
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,437
<i>The station looked abandoned.</i>

65
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:59,411
<i>A goat, a lamb and two kids
playing on the rails.</i>

66
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,705
- Why are you playing on the rails?
- Why not?

67
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,014
- The train might hit you!
- It won't, we've never seen one here.

68
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:12,302
- Come on! Play the train game!
- Leave me alone!

69
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:22,586
Look! Just like I told you...

70
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:25,353
Look at them leaving...
in high numbers!

71
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:30,107
- The oil workers?
- Yes. Since there is no more oil...

72
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:39,518
It's the death of this place.
Like in '33.

73
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,464
What happened in '33?

74
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,260
Ursei 1 burned down.

75
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:45,654
It blew up because of the gas.

76
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,269
There's a gas layer here...

77
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,481
The drillers call it "Hell's Gates".

78
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,259
I know it well.
It's a gas layer of 320 atmospheres.

79
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:06,231
<i>Even cities have their own lives.</i>

80
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,894
<i>They're born, they live and die.</i>

81
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,669
<i>This town was dying.</i>

82
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,393
<i>Oil was its blood.</i>

83
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:23,894
<i>But it had been drained of it.</i>

84
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,467
Keep the change!

85
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,129
Goodbye, thief!

86
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:57,182
If we don't show up at Ursei tonight,

87
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,394
they won't reassign us.

88
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:12,135
Any idea where the trust is?

89
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:22,951
- For you, I have an idea.
- Where I should go, then?

90
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,832
Allow me to take you there!

91
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,177
Gore.

92
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:29,953
Gore...

93
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,001
Gore!

94
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:32,952
Just a moment!

95
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,299
Buddy,

96
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,500
please put the bottles on the table.

97
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,919
Thank you, buddy.

98
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,092
Good day, Mrs. Stanila!

99
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,707
From what I see, the city is dead.

100
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,186
If they don't find any oil at Ursei 2,
everything will close down.

101
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,431
Who are you looking for, here?

102
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:16,317
I came for training.

103
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,042
Well, that is a weird idea.

104
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,703
No, thank you.

105
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,883
Wait here, Petrica!

106
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,375
I urge you to stay!

107
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Why? So I can dry up like the oil wells?

108
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:05,095
Can't you see
everything is rotten around here?

109
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:07,552
Why don't you wanna go to your folks?

110
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:10,216
Oltenia is pretty close to here.

111
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,861
- While here..
- There's a lot of oil here too.

112
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:15,613
You're mad, like the engineer at Ursei.

113
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,520
The trust will close down,
I'm telling you.

114
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,701
They don't trust him any longer.

115
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:32,028
Let's go, Petrica!

116
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,875
Careful not to fall!

117
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:00,110
So you're staying for Ursei?

118
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,514
<i>The trust was old and non-functional.</i>

119
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,220
<i>On the road,
my new acquaintance told me:</i>

120
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,620
The second crucial moment
in the life of the trust.

121
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,009
<i>I told him I didn't understand.</i>

122
00:13:27,062 --> 00:13:28,638
<i>And he explained:</i>

123
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,224
A trust has two big moments in its life.
The first is its creation.

124
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,808
- And the second one?
- Its closing down.

125
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,996
Make way for the inspector
coming from Bucharest!

126
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:44,203
Make way, comrades!

127
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:48,113
She's from Bucharest, comrades!

128
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:02,860
I am busy now!

129
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,825
I was assigned to Ursei.

130
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:19,711
Comrade, we've been assigned to Ursei.

131
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:21,163
I don't have time!

132
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:23,971
Be patient!

133
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:35,918
CHIEF ENGINEER

134
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:37,191
Ursei 2

135
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:39,433
is a pointless venture.

136
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,765
It might be,

137
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:45,808
but without oil we cannot survive.

138
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:49,874
We've been drilling in vain
for a year.

139
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:53,663
We confirmed in the report
that in 1933 at Ursei 1

140
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:56,341
there was nothing but
a gas layer which was...

141
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:59,366
exhausted at the moment
of the explosion.

142
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,230
What about you?

143
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:05,774
- What are you doing here?
- I've been assigned to Ursei.

144
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,269
We've been assigned to Ursei.

145
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:16,648
Is this the site of Ursei 1?

146
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,376
The old man...

147
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,313
The explosion catapulted him here.

148
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,055
Are you comrade Anca?

149
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,440
How come you know me?

150
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:15,311
Comrade engineer Emil Oprisan from
General Management told me to wait for you.

151
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,759
I wasn't expecting such a present!

152
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,394
How are you, my little dove?

153
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:31,567
Follow me!

154
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,141
Do you know her?

155
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,763
Tell me about it, buddy!

156
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:15,682
These are for you.

157
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,910
<i>Everything seemed so strange!</i>

158
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:32,941
<i>This day was so different,</i>

159
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,080
<i>compared to yesterday.</i>

160
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,319
<i>It was my last day of vacation.</i>

161
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,472
<i>I was not alone.</i>

162
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:57,417
<i>Emil was really sweet.</i>

163
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,566
<i>But sometimes I disliked his humour.</i>

164
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,103
Anca...

165
00:19:30,155 --> 00:19:32,101
this is your last day of vacation.

166
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,186
How about going dancing tonight?

167
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,674
You know dad will never approve.

168
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:39,065
My life is a bit too sweet, he says.

169
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,776
We'll pass by the General Management.

170
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,103
I'm looking for the General Manager.
I'm his daughter.

171
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:09,869
- Yes. First floor, on the right.
- Thank you.

172
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:38,846
- I don't think we can find seats.
- Let's try anyway.

173
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,118
Emil!

174
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:13,507
A fellow student.

175
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:29,557
My fiancée, Anca Banu.
Engineer Nina Manoliu.

176
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,623
Your fiancée?
I'm happy for you.

177
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,298
Get yourself a chair!

178
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,930
- I shouldn't have...
- He'll manage, don't worry.

179
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,594
I'll see what it's like
when I become a husband.

180
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:48,461
He's not my husband.

181
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:51,321
You don't know anything
about me anymore.

182
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,608
We haven't met for a million years!

183
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:54,813
For 4 years.

184
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:56,576
Actually 5...

185
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,104
Oh, how time flies!

186
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:02,237
What do you do now, Nina?

187
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,567
Nothing.

188
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:07,653
But what did you try to attain
back then at the Institute?

189
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:09,641
An oil engineer diploma?

190
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,020
No, a husband.

191
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,686
I drilled for one, but he didn't
make it through the refining process.

192
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:18,147
Let's just say...
he wasn't good quality.

193
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:26,647
I prefer the smell of Chanel,
rather than gas.

194
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,912
Don't you agree?

195
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:31,290
No. I'm leaving for training tomorrow.

196
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:33,563
At a drilling rig? Where?

197
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:35,746
I'm assigned to Ursei.

198
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:37,932
The Ursei 2 rig?

199
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:40,722
How strange!

200
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,407
- Tonight the ghosts are swarming.
- I don't understand.

201
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:58,029
We even have the perfect music
for ghost stories.

202
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:20,718
My ex-husband is at Ursei.

203
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,698
He stayed there.

204
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:24,518
Engineer Barbu.

205
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,250
Who?

206
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,067
- Barbu Andrei?
- Yeah.

207
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:32,252
The world is so small,
yet we know so little about it.

208
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:35,319
I didn't know
you had been married to him.

209
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:40,105
I made him choose between me
and the rig, and he preferred Ursei.

210
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:42,488
But Ursei surely is not beautiful.

211
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:46,914
But you should go dance!
That's why you came here.

212
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:12,780
If I were in your shoes,
I wouldn't let her leave.

213
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,353
Ursei is an ugly place.

214
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:15,638
Only mud...

215
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:17,078
and men.

216
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,204
Yes, Emil. It's me, Nina.

217
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,298
So Anca eventually left...

218
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:43,726
I'm very sorry.

219
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:47,798
I wouldn't have let her leave.

220
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:53,000
A woman, all alone, among so many men!

221
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:54,252
Anca...

222
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:56,270
Ok, Emil...

223
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:59,354
Call me if you go see her.

224
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,571
I'd like to know how things are there.

225
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:06,320
Good night, Emil!

226
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,157
Showing off...

227
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:15,803
What do you say, lon?

228
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,905
She's quite a pretty girl, isn't she?

229
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:29,798
You're all real chatterboxes!

230
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,116
Careful not to fall.

231
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:03,938
What do you mean by that?

232
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,923
Got some matches, buddy?

233
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:24,055
Go buy yourself some matches... buddy.

234
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:47,278
Is that heavy?

235
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:48,521
It is!

236
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:52,115
No pain, no supper, buddy.

237
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,821
- Who's that?
- Who?

238
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,298
Good day, comrade engineer!

239
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:04,532
Are you on leave?

240
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:08,057
Then you might...

241
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:11,042
Understood, comrade engineer.

242
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,252
Try one here, buddy!

243
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:29,531
I see you'll get some supper.

244
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,891
- Where's the engineer?
- On the rig platform.

245
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,781
Unscrew that!

246
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:06,287
Come in!

247
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,122
Why are you staring at me?

248
00:33:16,424 --> 00:33:18,901
- Have you worked on a rig before?
- No, I haven't.

249
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,075
This is my first one.

250
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:23,875
There are so many rigs in the country.

251
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:25,756
Here's my advice, young lady:

252
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,038
A truck is leaving
for the trust in 15 minutes.

253
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,885
Don't miss this wonderful
opportunity and go home.

254
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:32,257
That's all.

255
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:37,753
What if I don't want to leave?

256
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:01,974
- Still here?
- Yes, comrade engineer.

257
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:04,137
What are you doing there?

258
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,518
Studying the mud.

259
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:10,806
- Don't fall in the tank!
- I won't.

260
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:14,302
- That plank won't stand.
- It will!

261
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:16,965
Fine, then...

262
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:34,458
Won't you give me the blackberries?

263
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,018
I'll give you 20 lei for them.

264
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,085
Take them, I'm full anyway.

265
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:48,028
Where are you going?

266
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,391
To get blackberries.
They sell well. Wanna join?

267
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:55,396
Did I scare you?

268
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:57,501
You again? What do you want?

269
00:34:57,992 --> 00:35:00,880
- I picked some berries for you.
- When did you pick them?

270
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,661
I heard you like them.

271
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,550
I'll trade them for a kiss.

272
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,713
Where were you, buddy?

273
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,899
Want to become a chemist, huh?

274
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,510
Dobre, I got you some blackberries.

275
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,346
The mud tank!

276
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:26,893
Quick! Quick!

277
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:03,306
Wanted to study mud up-close?

278
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:43,369
He's a horrible man.

279
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:46,768
Apart from that, nothing.

280
00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:49,813
Mud,

281
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:51,047
noise...

282
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,623
boredom.

283
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:56,277
I'd like to leave this place.

284
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:00,822
Call me every night, Emil.

285
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,797
Who wants to lose some money?

286
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:10,492
Nobody?

287
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,297
It's worse than jail in here.

288
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:30,976
Found anything?

289
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:33,650
My ass!

290
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:39,744
We will all rot out here.

291
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:45,322
You've been rotting already.

292
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:47,420
They just forgot to bury you.

293
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:56,498
Hello, comrade engineer!

294
00:37:56,702 --> 00:37:58,163
Coming to the shower?

295
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:01,380
After sunbathing.
It's my special pastime.

296
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:15,269
When I set my eyes on one,
I'm determined to get her.

297
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,170
- So you like her too?
- I do. She's a strong woman.

298
00:38:19,224 --> 00:38:20,751
She is beautiful.

299
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:23,931
Playing the innocent
since she got a lab job.

300
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:26,440
Don't worry, I have my tricks.

301
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:27,695
What tricks?

302
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,181
I'll tell you my method.

303
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:40,733
Leave her alone!

304
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,105
Why?

305
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:45,592
She's got enough for all of us.

306
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:47,833
She's like a cigarette butt.

307
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:51,045
If you enjoy smoking butts...

308
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:40,039
What are you doing here?

309
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:43,898
- Looking for the beauty of Ursei.
- Get out!

310
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:47,574
Your hair has grown quite fast.

311
00:39:48,324 --> 00:39:52,324
It suits you better.
I couldn't stand your shorter hair.

312
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,981
I'm a delicate man and...

313
00:39:56,302 --> 00:39:58,447
Leave me alone!
Get out of here!

314
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,527
I don't like it when you scream.

315
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,181
I have a sensitive ear.

316
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:13,456
You might offend me and...

317
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:18,086
it would make the situation worse.

318
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:22,556
I came for the mud analysis.

319
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:26,277
- Am I intruding?
- No, comrade Gore.

320
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:27,403
Please, stay!

321
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:34,083
This room is pretty small.

322
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:36,766
Yeah, pretty small.

323
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:40,130
- So?
- There's no room for 3 people.

324
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:42,764
I think you heard me well.

325
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,079
You said had a sensitive ear.

326
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,773
Get out!

327
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,492
Now you go too!

328
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,726
What happened?

329
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:13,880
The cart wheel broke.

330
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,824
Are you alone?

331
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:18,771
The driver went back
to the city for help.

332
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:21,378
All this because of lon.

333
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:22,702
Who's lon?

334
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:25,324
lon lon, my husband.

335
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:28,155
He stayed in Ursei.

336
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:30,603
An engineer talked him into it.

337
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,896
He knows there isn't a drop of oil,
but he keeps digging.

338
00:42:34,503 --> 00:42:36,500
They're digging like
they're digging their own graves.

339
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,351
Can I be of any help?

340
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:50,719
What are you doing here?

341
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,119
Studying.

342
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,213
I'm completing my notebook.

343
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:56,217
Why don't you go to bed?
It's late.

344
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:57,494
I'm not tired.

345
00:42:58,025 --> 00:42:59,230
You're stubborn.

346
00:42:59,282 --> 00:43:01,335
- Stubborn and...
- And?

347
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:03,451
Nothing.

348
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:06,498
Now I understand
why Nina left this place.

349
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,987
You know Nina?

350
00:43:09,974 --> 00:43:11,784
That's not your business, anyway.

351
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:13,889
You could mind your words.

352
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:19,311
You should be more careful!

353
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:22,500
Listen, young lady:

354
00:43:23,474 --> 00:43:25,148
you should be more careful.

355
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,018
Come in!

356
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,751
Emil!

357
00:43:58,324 --> 00:43:59,382
My dearest!

358
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:03,670
- You've come right on time.
- Unfortunately, I can't stay long.

359
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,615
Let me look at you, Anca! You're the
most beautiful girl-driller in the world.

360
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:10,885
Emil...

361
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:36,983
Why are you so silent?

362
00:44:40,398 --> 00:44:41,757
Want me to sing?

363
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:45,478
You know very well I don't.

364
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,612
We've drilled over 2800 meters and...

365
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:51,876
nothing.

366
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:58,780
Why are you telling me this?

367
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,561
You're right.

368
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:04,204
I'm saying this to myself, not to you.

369
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:07,083
2800 meters...

370
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:16,373
Mr. Dobre, how do you
get a girl to like you?

371
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,606
- Bring here some berries!
- Doesn't work.

372
00:45:22,027 --> 00:45:23,574
I think I know how!

373
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:27,139
I read a novel about a driver

374
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:30,164
who seduced his lover
with some poppy flowers.

375
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:31,536
With flowers!

376
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:32,902
He brought her flowers.

377
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:34,507
Mr. Dobre...

378
00:45:35,614 --> 00:45:37,679
Have you really read that or...?

379
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,478
Comrade Emil Oprisan,

380
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:52,083
the Chief engineer
from the Head Office, is here.

381
00:45:54,407 --> 00:45:55,768
He's awful.

382
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:59,032
- Nina told me.
- You can't imagine how he treats me!

383
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,021
He's just awful.

384
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,987
- Am I interrupting?
- No, not at all.

385
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,871
I haven't seen you in a year.

386
00:46:09,244 --> 00:46:10,869
Since we started drilling here.

387
00:46:11,994 --> 00:46:14,599
- And how's it going?
- !Still drilling.

388
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:20,190
- I have even worse news.
- I thought so.

389
00:46:20,887 --> 00:46:25,079
The General Management is preparing
the order of liquidation for this oil well.

390
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,606
Close it down?

391
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:29,789
There are tons of crude oil
under this gas layer.

392
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,567
- And the idiots want to shut it down.
- Yet, where is that layer?

393
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:36,760
You're almost at 3000 meters.

394
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,233
Where's the layer...?

395
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:40,990
- Right here, under your feet.
- I hope so.

396
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:46,724
The management wants to know how long
it will take you to get to the oil layer.

397
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:50,034
<i>Or it might be better to abandon it.</i>

398
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,677
I need three weeks.

399
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:56,619
Fine, I will inform the management.

400
00:46:57,032 --> 00:46:58,715
- Do you still need me?
- No.

401
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,722
- Why? Got work to do?
- Yes, I do.

402
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:03,143
Good night!

403
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:50,282
What are you looking at?
What do you want?

404
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:52,065
You can stay if you want.

405
00:47:52,117 --> 00:47:54,302
I'm leaving! You hear me?

406
00:47:54,353 --> 00:47:57,347
- Who's gonna' take your place, Panait?
- I don't care.

407
00:47:57,398 --> 00:47:59,981
There's no oil, I tell you.
Only gases.

408
00:48:00,032 --> 00:48:01,782
The inspector said that.

409
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:03,447
The engineer is lying!

410
00:48:03,498 --> 00:48:05,748
We'll all burn, like they did in '33.

411
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,655
There's no oil! There is no oil!

412
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:10,710
Shut up or I'll kill you.

413
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,717
After you finish this training,

414
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:29,577
would you like to...

415
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,262
Actually, I'll ask you some other time.

416
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:35,610
Goodbye!

417
00:48:57,677 --> 00:48:59,262
I forgot to tell you.

418
00:48:59,315 --> 00:49:02,670
There's a crashed cart
at about 43 km from here,

419
00:49:03,378 --> 00:49:06,485
carrying the luggage
of one of your drillers.

420
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:11,045
Is that an allusion to the rats
leaving the sinking ship?

421
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:13,219
The wife of a certain lon lon.

422
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,646
lon lon's wife.

423
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:34,554
- At 43 km.
- Close to the tarmac.

424
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,976
Good morning!

425
00:49:37,831 --> 00:49:41,137
- Get her things in the truck
and bring them back to the city! - Yes.

426
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:45,239
Get her something to eat too!

427
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:47,831
Understood, comrade engineer.

428
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:51,181
And I don't want lon finding out.

429
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:03,202
I trusted you.

430
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:07,010
- Do you know what I did for Ursei?
- I do.

431
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:09,264
You left your family.

432
00:50:09,317 --> 00:50:12,114
I didn't know that this land was so dry.

433
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:15,012
I thought I could bathe in oil.

434
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,364
Without oil...

435
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:18,775
Listen, lon:

436
00:50:20,635 --> 00:50:23,768
I still believe in my calculations.
Understand?

437
00:50:24,534 --> 00:50:25,983
There is oil here.

438
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:27,706
There must be oil.

439
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:29,244
Oil? Here?

440
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:31,967
Like Burca said,

441
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:34,425
"When the pigs fly and hell freezes... "

442
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:35,463
Keep working!

443
00:50:35,514 --> 00:50:38,400
And stop following Burca!
He's a bad lot.

444
00:50:55,894 --> 00:50:58,000
Dinu! Dinu!

445
00:51:07,009 --> 00:51:10,670
See if engineer Oprisan has arrived.

446
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,489
Hello, Emil?

447
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:39,447
Yes, it's Nina.

448
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:41,847
Got any news?

449
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,802
Don't you want to come over?

450
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:06,237
Are they for me?

451
00:52:08,646 --> 00:52:09,791
What do you think?

452
00:52:14,726 --> 00:52:16,282
I think you're an idiot.

453
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:20,282
Take it easy...

454
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:23,230
dude.

455
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:32,173
It's not worth fighting for a whore.

456
00:52:32,226 --> 00:52:34,514
- What did you say?
- What you heard.

457
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,463
Good thing you got rid of the flowers.

458
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:41,184
For her, money is more valuable
than the flowers.

459
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:43,885
- Get it?
- You're lying!

460
00:52:45,086 --> 00:52:46,536
I seldom lie.

461
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,052
Why do you think her hair is so short?

462
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:51,882
Because it's stylish?

463
00:52:52,978 --> 00:52:54,612
No, my friend.

464
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:57,465
It's because her hair hasn't grown yet.

465
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,335
She had been shaved bald recently.

466
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,126
Know what that means?

467
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:13,132
How do you know?

468
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,652
I just know, my friend.

469
00:53:18,878 --> 00:53:20,268
I saw her on the job.

470
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,431
I was on a two-month holiday back then.

471
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:26,096
At Berision.

472
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:30,077
If you're lying...

473
00:53:30,461 --> 00:53:34,405
- Want me to prove it?
- No. I'll find out for myself.

474
00:53:35,994 --> 00:53:38,106
I don't think you'll succeed.

475
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:42,282
I will still visit her tonight.

476
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:08,578
Convicted for PROSTITUTION

477
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:27,429
You're the one bringing me
flowers every day?

478
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:29,271
I used to...

479
00:54:38,552 --> 00:54:40,364
Then why are you here?

480
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:42,302
I want to speak to you.

481
00:54:44,496 --> 00:54:45,778
What's the use?

482
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,766
I want to know the truth.

483
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:49,568
I'm an honest man.

484
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,211
Everybody says that about themselves.

485
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,711
Even myself.

486
00:54:55,356 --> 00:54:56,914
Do you really say that about yourself?

487
00:54:57,177 --> 00:54:59,028
I do. But who believes me?

488
00:54:59,342 --> 00:55:00,125
I do.

489
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:01,280
I do, Bica.

490
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:04,916
I want to believe you.
Do you understand?

491
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,927
Fine.

492
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:14,125
Sit down and hear me out!

493
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:22,092
And don't interrupt me,
since this is our last talk.

494
00:55:22,143 --> 00:55:24,206
- Bica!
- I told you not to interrupt me!

495
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:30,420
I used to be a telephone operator.

496
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,981
I was in love with a student.

497
00:55:33,507 --> 00:55:35,876
He left me when he took his medical degree.

498
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:40,795
I was engaged to a tailor last year.

499
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,418
He had a little workshop.

500
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:49,043
I once asked him why
he was delaying the wedding.

501
00:55:49,376 --> 00:55:50,681
He didn't answer.

502
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:52,911
I asked him again.

503
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,447
We got in a quarrel.

504
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:57,027
I ran from his place immediately.

505
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:18,536
<i>I ran up the street like a lunatic.</i>

506
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:30,371
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

507
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:33,378
<i>It was late.</i>

508
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:38,824
<i>I went to a park</i>

509
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:43,434
<i>and sat on a bench.</i>

510
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,246
<i>After a while,</i>

511
00:56:48,811 --> 00:56:51,057
<i>a man approached me.</i>

512
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:56,311
He asked for my I.D.
I didn't have it on me.

513
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:00,940
<i>The tailor told them
he didn't know me.</i>

514
00:57:00,978 --> 00:57:03,978
<i>I was sent for moral rehabilitation.</i>

515
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:05,514
They shaved my head

516
00:57:07,146 --> 00:57:10,338
and sentenced me
to 6 months for prostitution.

517
00:57:12,112 --> 00:57:14,932
They also sentenced Burca
for theft around that time.

518
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:19,407
That's what you wanted to know.

519
00:57:20,161 --> 00:57:21,728
Are you satisfied now?

520
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,144
Tell me!

521
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:32,764
Go away!

522
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:38,911
Good evening, my little bird.

523
00:57:40,088 --> 00:57:41,369
How are you?

524
00:57:43,034 --> 00:57:45,326
I hope that Gore

525
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,489
hasn't raised the prices.

526
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:52,547
- Be quiet or I'll hit you!
- Don't touch me!

527
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,264
Leave me alone!

528
00:57:54,315 --> 00:57:56,862
- What the hell do you want?
- To kill you.

529
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:58,565
Just try!

530
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:14,181
Listen to me!

531
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:15,360
Bica is mine.

532
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:18,702
If you don't leave the rig now,
I'll kill you like an animal.

533
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:31,943
What happened to you?
Who hit you?

534
00:59:31,996 --> 00:59:32,918
Gore!

535
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,184
For that whore!

536
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:38,463
He killed me, comrade engineer.

537
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:41,510
- What did you want with her?
- She asked for money.

538
00:59:41,563 --> 00:59:44,523
I didn't give her any,
so Gore tried to kill me.

539
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:46,286
He's lying.

540
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:48,835
Shut up!
Tell Bica to come see me tomorrow!

541
01:00:14,847 --> 01:00:16,525
Got something to tell me?

542
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:24,271
There's enough dirt on our boots.
Just leave!

543
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:26,409
There's no place for you here.

544
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:32,902
It's about Bica.

545
01:00:32,954 --> 01:00:35,271
- Bica needs to leave.
- Why?

546
01:00:35,324 --> 01:00:37,193
Thing aren't that simple.

547
01:00:37,525 --> 01:00:39,934
- I know her past.
- I know it too.

548
01:00:40,266 --> 01:00:42,315
Then everything is clear.

549
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:45,884
Do you know what I think of you?

550
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,137
You don't know how people are.
And you don't know Bica.

551
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,376
You're just a broken piece of metal
from this dried-up rig.

552
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:55,161
You've never loved anyone
in your life.

553
01:00:55,213 --> 01:00:58,081
Maybe only these oily rig engines.

554
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:02,987
I hate you, you hear me?

555
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:04,240
I hate you!

556
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:35,407
Bica!

557
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:01,963
He's going to fall!

558
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:19,697
Dobre, activate the hook!

559
01:03:52,085 --> 01:03:53,291
Leave me alone!

560
01:03:53,648 --> 01:03:55,159
Leave me alone!

561
01:04:47,275 --> 01:04:48,735
Stop crying, Bica!

562
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:54,702
You know...
I have a house in the city.

563
01:04:55,945 --> 01:04:58,007
I have no parents,

564
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:00,273
I only have you.

565
01:05:00,695 --> 01:05:02,206
Leave me, Gore!

566
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,536
Leave me alone!

567
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:38,090
- When's the truck coming, uncle Dobre?
- Are you leaving?

568
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:44,161
Because of the engineer?

569
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,498
Yeah.

570
01:05:53,277 --> 01:05:54,969
He's made a mistake about Bica.

571
01:05:56,543 --> 01:05:57,427
But...

572
01:06:09,027 --> 01:06:11,614
He's hard and stiff like a walnut.

573
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:16,088
He works here, in slime and rain.

574
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:20,539
People come and go,
but he remains and drills on.

575
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:23,882
But it's in vain,
there's not a drop of oil here.

576
01:06:25,496 --> 01:06:26,969
You're right.

577
01:06:27,686 --> 01:06:29,389
Then why is he digging?

578
01:06:31,297 --> 01:06:34,038
Because there NEEDS to be oil here.

579
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:37,918
The people are waiting for it
and the ground needs to provide it.

580
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:40,632
Without oil, we are nothing.

581
01:06:41,952 --> 01:06:43,322
And he knows it.

582
01:06:43,744 --> 01:06:45,088
That's why he goes on drilling.

583
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,072
Drilling silently, like a mole.

584
01:08:27,493 --> 01:08:29,069
Hello, comrade Bica!

585
01:08:30,594 --> 01:08:32,988
We're stuck on a crosswords puzzle.

586
01:08:33,935 --> 01:08:36,369
"What turns litmus paper red?"

587
01:08:36,421 --> 01:08:37,457
4 letters.

588
01:08:40,769 --> 01:08:41,832
Acid.

589
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,213
Acid!

590
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,231
Comrade...

591
01:08:57,518 --> 01:08:59,452
I'm waiting for the mud analysis.

592
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:27,327
We planned to talk
on the phone every night at 9.

593
01:09:29,094 --> 01:09:31,054
And it's the third time
she's not answering.

594
01:09:32,051 --> 01:09:33,511
I don't know what to believe.

595
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:35,802
You don't want to believe
what you already know.

596
01:09:36,136 --> 01:09:38,262
I didn't stand a chance
against the rig either.

597
01:09:38,985 --> 01:09:41,418
It's a rival I can't be proud of.

598
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,318
But your current rival is beautiful.

599
01:09:45,073 --> 01:09:46,123
Anca?

600
01:09:47,186 --> 01:09:48,556
You're being mean, Emil.

601
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:50,247
I'm being mean with myself.

602
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:53,532
No, Nina.

603
01:09:56,146 --> 01:09:57,466
Give me a cigarette, please.

604
01:10:06,148 --> 01:10:07,634
And light, please.

605
01:10:12,268 --> 01:10:14,407
Light for two disheartened folks.

606
01:10:18,811 --> 01:10:20,783
I haven't given up yet.

607
01:10:21,244 --> 01:10:22,987
There's nothing you can do, Emil.

608
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:24,984
But there is.

609
01:10:25,523 --> 01:10:27,391
I can shut down the well.

610
01:10:30,282 --> 01:10:33,625
Comrade engineer Andrei Barbu
will have a surprise.

611
01:10:34,265 --> 01:10:38,337
I'm reporting to the Ministry tomorrow
about his futile project.

612
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,796
But you supported it.

613
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:42,179
They'll question your professionalism.

614
01:10:45,304 --> 01:10:47,929
- And that's exactly what they should do.
- Emil, control yourself!

615
01:10:48,564 --> 01:10:49,573
I can't.

616
01:10:51,086 --> 01:10:54,454
I can just see them walking
like two lovers, holding hands.

617
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:58,016
And then I thought of abandoning it,

618
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:00,454
like most people abandoned their houses.

619
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,698
Gore!

620
01:11:10,581 --> 01:11:11,814
How is lon?

621
01:11:38,287 --> 01:11:39,798
This is my house.

622
01:11:59,346 --> 01:12:01,050
If we find oil,

623
01:12:01,345 --> 01:12:03,086
you'll make it beautiful.

624
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:17,890
Follow me!

625
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:21,604
Come on, move it, move it!

626
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:27,086
What are you waiting for?
Come on, move it!

627
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,327
"I didn't want to just drill an oil well. "

628
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,605
"I took responsibility"

629
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:49,448
"in giving life to this region. "

630
01:12:52,382 --> 01:12:53,560
Continue!

631
01:12:56,365 --> 01:12:59,529
"In bringing back to normal
the lives of some people,"

632
01:12:59,582 --> 01:13:01,949
"lives which were full of misfortunes. "

633
01:13:02,895 --> 01:13:06,962
"People whom I know and who
do not deserve these misfortunes. "

634
01:13:07,813 --> 01:13:09,256
"And I acted accordingly. "

635
01:13:09,309 --> 01:13:11,225
"Signed: Andrei Barbu"

636
01:13:25,524 --> 01:13:28,059
- Put me through Ursei 2!
- Can I take those?

637
01:13:28,944 --> 01:13:30,056
Take that too!

638
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:31,479
Come on!

639
01:13:31,645 --> 01:13:32,760
Hello?

640
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:34,180
Ursei 2?

641
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:35,895
Who is this?

642
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:37,036
Yeah.

643
01:13:37,087 --> 01:13:39,738
Please tell comrade Barbu that...

644
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,145
- They're shutting it down!
- Who told you that?

645
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:44,502
- The driver.
- He just came from the trust.

646
01:13:44,784 --> 01:13:47,409
- Just ask him, he's outside.
- Is it true?

647
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:54,947
So you lied to me, comrade engineer.

648
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:02,911
Comrade engineer,
they're coming to shut it down!

649
01:14:48,145 --> 01:14:50,310
So you came to close the rig, lon?

650
01:14:52,506 --> 01:14:54,502
Yes, comrade engineer.

651
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:58,556
Then do it, it's yours anyway.

652
01:15:07,344 --> 01:15:08,523
Let's go!

653
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:26,520
The Chief Engineer informs us
that the trust has been disbanded.

654
01:15:27,992 --> 01:15:29,337
How about the rig?

655
01:15:29,773 --> 01:15:32,654
Informs us to continue working
only on a single shift.

656
01:15:33,622 --> 01:15:35,287
What depth are we at?

657
01:15:35,338 --> 01:15:37,631
3150 meters.

658
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,243
Increase the drilling speed
from 6 to 9.

659
01:15:42,963 --> 01:15:44,835
Understood, comrade engineer.

660
01:15:56,096 --> 01:15:57,135
8, Gore.

661
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:58,518
And with you, 9.

662
01:15:58,978 --> 01:16:00,746
We can manage two shifts.

663
01:16:00,797 --> 01:16:03,242
Gore at the bridge on the first shift.

664
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:05,163
Vasile can take over the night shift.

665
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:07,341
You at the winch, for the night shift.

666
01:16:07,608 --> 01:16:11,220
- And Comrade Anca can take your place
during the day. - She is leaving.

667
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:15,176
Comrade Emil Oprisan said
he'd come to take her tomorrow.

668
01:16:15,842 --> 01:16:17,328
Her training is over.

669
01:16:18,594 --> 01:16:19,862
Comrade Anca?

670
01:16:20,578 --> 01:16:21,514
Yeah...

671
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:22,963
Then...

672
01:16:24,104 --> 01:16:26,140
lon can do the winch day shift.

673
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,148
He's leaving...

674
01:16:29,556 --> 01:16:30,595
lon?

675
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:33,757
Fine, we'll continue working.

676
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:40,851
Consequent to the decision
of the General Management,

677
01:16:40,904 --> 01:16:44,015
after the report-analysis of the
Technical Service Department,

678
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:47,305
the drilling works are suspended
at the Ursei 2, Trust 3 Muntenia.

679
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:09,402
The mud at the tank is rising!

680
01:18:09,453 --> 01:18:11,078
The mud is rising!

681
01:18:13,716 --> 01:18:14,895
The mud is rising!

682
01:18:15,867 --> 01:18:17,417
The mud is rising!

683
01:18:27,095 --> 01:18:28,363
Comrade engineer!

684
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:30,426
Comrade engineer!

685
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:33,140
Where is Comrade engineer?

686
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:35,137
Hey, Mr. Dobre!

687
01:18:37,262 --> 01:18:39,210
To the mud volcanoes!

688
01:18:40,363 --> 01:18:41,988
Comrade engineer!

689
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:46,404
Comrade engineer!

690
01:19:34,851 --> 01:19:36,554
The mud's density is decreasing.

691
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,141
The mud tank is boiling.

692
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,380
Comrade engineer!

693
01:19:47,064 --> 01:19:49,485
Bica, did she say anything before she left?

694
01:19:50,739 --> 01:19:51,765
No, she didn't.

695
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:57,551
- How much has it decreased?
- To 1.6.

696
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:03,532
Mud Density

697
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:08,512
The Gates of Hell.

698
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,262
1000 revs.

699
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,871
Speed up the engines! 1000 revs!

700
01:20:35,234 --> 01:20:37,399
Driller, take care of the tank!

701
01:20:38,436 --> 01:20:41,356
- Anca!
- Going right now, comrade engineer.

702
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,595
Dobre, call the trust!

703
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:48,309
Maybe the truck hasn't left
and our people are still there.

704
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,881
Who the hell could that be?

705
01:22:07,414 --> 01:22:08,644
Wait a minute.

706
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,373
Just wait.

707
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:13,037
Hello? The trust?

708
01:22:13,497 --> 01:22:15,533
- Who's there?
- It's me.

709
01:22:15,585 --> 01:22:17,414
<i>- "Me" who?
- The trust.</i>

710
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:22,988
- Who exactly?
- Now the trust is only me, the guard.

711
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:24,908
<i>This is Ursei 2.</i>

712
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,353
<i>- Hasn't the truck with our drillers
passed by there? - It did.</i>

713
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:31,761
Yes, it has just left for Ploiesti.

714
01:22:36,612 --> 01:22:39,077
The truck has left for Ploiesti.
There's no one there.

715
01:22:39,112 --> 01:22:41,150
- Who did you talk to?
- The guard.

716
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:45,746
We need men and barite supplies
from the General Management.

717
01:22:45,797 --> 01:22:48,858
In three hours they could be here.
We have to talk through the trust.

718
01:22:48,909 --> 01:22:50,573
Tell the guard to connect you!

719
01:22:50,957 --> 01:22:52,917
I'll try, comrade engineer.

720
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,850
I used to be a telephone operator.

721
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:34,341
Nina!

722
01:23:35,751 --> 01:23:37,134
How did you get in?

723
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:40,820
I knew you were coming back alone, Emil.

724
01:24:01,918 --> 01:24:03,327
Emil, don't be a fool!

725
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:07,860
Hello!

726
01:24:07,912 --> 01:24:09,601
Ursei 2 here.

727
01:24:09,654 --> 01:24:10,753
The rig!

728
01:24:10,806 --> 01:24:14,233
We hit the gas layer, we need help!

729
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:16,256
My child...

730
01:24:17,087 --> 01:24:18,650
I'm alone here, but I'm coming.

731
01:24:19,853 --> 01:24:21,722
Listen to me!

732
01:24:21,774 --> 01:24:23,131
You don't need to come.

733
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:25,909
You need to connect me
with the General Management.

734
01:24:25,962 --> 01:24:28,162
We need barite supplies and men.

735
01:24:28,452 --> 01:24:31,564
Do you have the keys
to the telephone exchange?

736
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:33,934
But I don't know how to use it.

737
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:35,297
Go and open it!

738
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:37,368
- I need to get the keys first.
- Hurry up!

739
01:24:44,297 --> 01:24:46,335
Which one is it?

740
01:25:28,431 --> 01:25:29,365
Gas!

741
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,694
Hello?

742
01:25:43,997 --> 01:25:45,431
Come on, uncle!

743
01:25:47,134 --> 01:25:48,034
Hello?

744
01:26:36,326 --> 01:26:37,319
Hello?

745
01:26:37,831 --> 01:26:39,408
Hello? Ursei?

746
01:26:40,372 --> 01:26:41,438
Ursei?

747
01:26:41,886 --> 01:26:43,301
It erupted!

748
01:26:43,354 --> 01:26:44,765
<i>It's an eruption!</i>

749
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:46,242
Eruption?

750
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:48,985
Tell me how to make the connection.

751
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,542
Insert the fifth plug.

752
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,876
Wait...

753
01:26:51,927 --> 01:26:55,061
The fifth plug in the first hole
of the second row.

754
01:26:55,225 --> 01:26:56,771
In the first hole...

755
01:26:57,992 --> 01:26:59,426
of the second row.

756
01:27:01,342 --> 01:27:03,269
And ask for Bucharest.

757
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:05,113
Bucharest!

758
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:06,065
Increase!

759
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,167
- Hello?
- Bucharest!

760
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:08,863
Hello!

761
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:09,755
Increase!

762
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:17,786
Open the second pump!

763
01:27:18,193 --> 01:27:19,884
Open the second pump!

764
01:27:23,612 --> 01:27:25,533
Open the second pump!

765
01:27:25,586 --> 01:27:28,082
Open the second pump...

766
01:27:35,364 --> 01:27:37,324
Close the blowout preventer!

767
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:59,238
It's useless, it's broken.

768
01:27:59,289 --> 01:28:00,850
The hooks won't tighten up.

769
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,655
I don't want to die.

770
01:28:02,873 --> 01:28:04,770
I don't want to die!

771
01:28:07,881 --> 01:28:09,314
I don't want to die!

772
01:28:09,365 --> 01:28:10,903
To comrade engineer!

773
01:28:15,993 --> 01:28:18,195
- The preventer doesn't hold.
- Put the emergency one!

774
01:28:18,271 --> 01:28:20,935
Bucharest! The trust speaking.

775
01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:24,127
Which one?
Wait, let me tell you!

776
01:28:24,162 --> 01:28:26,185
Ursei 2 has erupted.

777
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,480
Erupted!

778
01:28:27,533 --> 01:28:29,927
Send men and barite!

779
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:36,145
Who am I?

780
01:28:36,453 --> 01:28:38,975
I am... the driller...

781
01:28:39,501 --> 01:28:41,050
I mean the guard...

782
01:28:41,485 --> 01:28:42,715
the old man.

783
01:28:45,078 --> 01:28:46,699
What do you need?

784
01:28:46,734 --> 01:28:48,144
It's comrade engineer.

785
01:28:48,195 --> 01:28:50,909
Hello? Don't interrupt me!

786
01:28:50,962 --> 01:28:54,520
Has comrade engineer been
connected to the Minister's office?

787
01:28:54,573 --> 01:28:56,493
The second oil well has erupted.

788
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:58,592
Alarm at the Ursei 2 oil well!

789
01:29:07,751 --> 01:29:09,826
- Don't answer, Emil!
- I have to.

790
01:29:11,836 --> 01:29:12,810
Yes.

791
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:14,770
Engineer Oprisan.

792
01:29:18,087 --> 01:29:18,971
Fine.

793
01:29:19,893 --> 01:29:20,802
Fine.

794
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,880
I'll come right over.

795
01:29:23,904 --> 01:29:25,108
I'll give the order.

796
01:29:25,773 --> 01:29:27,399
I'll do everything necessary.

797
01:29:33,007 --> 01:29:34,019
Nina,

798
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:36,061
I'm a wretched man.

799
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:38,930
Don't use such harsh words, Emil!

800
01:29:40,963 --> 01:29:43,179
I told them to shut the well down.

801
01:29:43,448 --> 01:29:44,358
And?

802
01:29:45,318 --> 01:29:46,893
Ursei has erupted.

803
01:29:53,568 --> 01:29:55,860
You'll be criticized.

804
01:29:57,452 --> 01:29:59,104
I hope they'll be harsh.

805
01:29:59,591 --> 01:30:00,667
We're leaving.

806
01:30:02,037 --> 01:30:03,907
I have to give the order.

807
01:30:05,863 --> 01:30:06,786
Yeah.

808
01:30:22,779 --> 01:30:24,610
I've never felt so...

809
01:30:27,043 --> 01:30:28,210
Let's go!

810
01:31:31,985 --> 01:31:33,625
We're losing pressure.

811
01:31:33,997 --> 01:31:35,917
It's leaking at the flange.

812
01:31:37,634 --> 01:31:39,694
Someone needs to climb and repair it.

813
01:31:47,519 --> 01:31:49,208
Don't! You have your family.

814
01:33:05,416 --> 01:33:07,778
I haven't opened... the valve.

815
01:33:08,355 --> 01:33:09,918
Bring the stretcher!

816
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:13,496
Water!

817
01:33:14,851 --> 01:33:16,081
Comrade...

818
01:33:16,376 --> 01:33:17,515
Anca...

819
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:19,514
Bica...

820
01:33:20,203 --> 01:33:21,550
Don't tell her!

821
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,783
I won't. Don't worry.

822
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:26,363
Water...

823
01:33:30,826 --> 01:33:33,847
Gore needs to be sent to the hospital,
otherwise he'll die in a few hours.

824
01:33:34,457 --> 01:33:35,828
I want to, but how?

825
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:36,847
We don't have men to spare.

826
01:33:36,899 --> 01:33:39,520
There are three at the well rim
and one in the engine room.

827
01:33:39,555 --> 01:33:41,407
We need four men for the stretcher.

828
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,324
- How will we do it?
- We don't have a choice.

829
01:33:43,377 --> 01:33:44,939
We have to shut it down.

830
01:33:46,193 --> 01:33:48,855
Shut the rig down?!
When we're so close to the oil?

831
01:33:48,908 --> 01:33:49,854
Never!

832
01:33:49,905 --> 01:33:51,841
You will shut it down, comrade Barbu.

833
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:54,893
Are you giving me orders,
comrade brigadier?

834
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:55,610
It's not an order.

835
01:33:55,645 --> 01:33:57,008
It's a task from the Party.

836
01:33:57,043 --> 01:33:59,639
A man was born here and
we don't have the right to kill him.

837
01:34:00,095 --> 01:34:01,721
Not even for 1.000 oil wells!

838
01:34:16,335 --> 01:34:17,896
Shut down the well!

839
01:34:37,707 --> 01:34:38,719
Gore!

840
01:34:39,065 --> 01:34:40,140
Andrei!

841
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,047
Gore vanished!

842
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:45,378
He fled.

843
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:50,363
Gore?

844
01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:52,949
Gore!

845
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:33,248
Lower the drill pipe!

846
01:35:54,525 --> 01:35:56,979
Oil! Oil!

847
01:36:18,344 --> 01:36:20,265
God bless you, lon!

848
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:23,989
Come on in!

849
01:36:24,707 --> 01:36:27,421
Come on, watch your step!

850
01:36:28,003 --> 01:36:29,015
Good job!

851
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:34,239
Like it?

852
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:38,158
You can laugh too.

853
01:36:39,322 --> 01:36:40,846
Get in there too!

854
01:36:41,127 --> 01:36:42,153
Come on!

855
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:44,534
- Do it yourself!
- Go on, go on!

856
01:36:44,587 --> 01:36:46,199
Go on!

857
01:37:11,368 --> 01:37:12,546
Buddy...

858
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:21,328
<i>Ursei 2</i>

859
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:23,238
<i>The oil well.</i>

860
01:37:23,738 --> 01:37:26,055
<i>Mud, noise, boredom.</i>

861
01:37:26,594 --> 01:37:28,667
<i>It meant so much more for me!</i>

862
01:37:31,457 --> 01:37:35,412
<i>It means so much for
the people I learnt to know here...</i>

863
01:37:38,427 --> 01:37:40,286
<i>Now we are leaving them.</i>

864
01:37:40,746 --> 01:37:42,436
<i>My husband and I.</i>

865
01:37:51,234 --> 01:37:53,399
<i>Another Ursei is waiting for us.</i>

866
01:38:00,201 --> 01:38:04,427
<i>My life yesterday was so different
compared to my life today</i>

867
01:38:06,176 --> 01:38:08,161
<i>and my life tomorrow.</i>

868
01:38:33,525 --> 01:38:38,636
THE END
