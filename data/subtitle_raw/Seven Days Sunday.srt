1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,082
This is based on a true story

2
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,161
It was like an adrenalin rush.

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,440
I was buzzing and my head was empty.

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,006
I thought I could kill him.

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,965
That's all.

6
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,644
The 14th of January 1996
was a normal day.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,365
The fact that it was Sunday
had nothing to do with it.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,367
Most of us had left school after 8 years

9
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,928
and so we could do what we wanted.

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,123
Every day was a holiday.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,409
SEVEN DAYS SUNDAY

12
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,324
Good morning, young man.

13
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,009
It's about time for church. Get ready.

14
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,167
Wear a warm jacket. Are you listening?

15
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,051
I'd like to come but I'm just too tired.

16
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,089
Yeah.

17
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,483
Make us some tea.

18
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,926
Thanks.

19
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,971
Hi.

20
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,682
Alright?

21
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,247
Yeah, good. How are you doing?

22
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,683
Yeah, me too. I was on my way upstairs.

23
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,885
Yeah, I've got to shake a leg too.
See you.

24
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,966
Maybe we'll see one another again?

25
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,645
Hey, it's about time.

26
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,524
I had to do something.

27
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,484
Did you do that girl finally?

28
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,449
We were in the park yesterday,
at the place where no one goes.

29
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,610
I showed you that.

30
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,008
Whatever. Anyway, we were talking

31
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,011
You chickened out.

32
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,969
Like I was saying.
We were standing there

33
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,680
and suddenly three wankers appeared.

34
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,650
Who were those wankers?

35
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,046
No idea.

36
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,206
Did you at least beat them up?

37
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,569
It all went so quick.

38
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,251
You wouldn't have scored
with Sarah anyway.

39
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,681
She's a bit out of your league.

40
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,490
I've got something here with me.

41
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,884
Take it. It's good.

42
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,291
Do you feel anything?

43
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,965
Don't you want to try that whole thing
some other time?

44
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,048
Now or never.

45
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,689
It was you who said it's so easy.

46
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,043
Somehow this place is holy to me.

47
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,365
Quit the crap. No one'll nail us.

48
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,446
You go in and I'll keep an eye out.

49
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,810
It's riskier for me than you.
No one knows you here.

50
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,407
You're such a wimp.

51
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,886
Get your filthy hands off me!

52
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,960
Do it!

53
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,086
Morning, Adam. Where were you?

54
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,684
Get ready!

55
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,805
<i>We ask God the Father,</i>

56
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,484
for forgiveness for the suffering
that we cause others,

57
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,527
that we neglect and forget others,

58
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,528
that we lack understanding or tolerance
for one another,

59
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:46,487
that we speak evil and
that we are full of hate and bitterness.

60
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,131
Let us pray for forgiveness
from all our sins

61
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,203
that we commit against one another
without our control.

62
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,083
Tommek?

63
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,090
Sarah, just forget about it!

64
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,883
Put that away.
I've got something much cooler.

65
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,610
Keep the needle still and it won't hurt.

66
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,331
Where is Adam then?

67
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,125
The idiot got caught.

68
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,640
You realised it in time?

69
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,091
I tried to warn him.

70
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,082
The wimp didn't get it.

71
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,607
Because of that idiot
I'm standing here empty-handed.

72
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,087
Ouch!

73
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,123
You okay?
- I'm fine.

74
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,161
There you are.

75
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,411
I thought they caught you.

76
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,611
I've got a plan
to get us something to drink.

77
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,241
Not bad, this shit. Try it.

78
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,642
We should have thought of it sooner.

79
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,601
We'll do that tattoo later,
when it's only us two.

80
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,568
Fuck you!

81
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,164
Here, have a swig.
- Forget it, kiddie.

82
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,046
Let him try it.

83
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,164
What does your sister say about it?

84
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,681
Are you stupid? Stop it!

85
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,687
Hey, I didn't steal this shit for that,
it's a waste of good wine!

86
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,406
It's about time you went home, piss off!

87
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,562
Chill out!

88
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,961
I can't be bothered.

89
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,329
Maybe it's better that he goes.

90
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,885
You can have your peace and quiet.
- Always causing trouble!

91
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,168
You don't know what stress is!

92
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,085
In the city it's completely different.

93
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,849
There's always something going on.

94
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,721
Robberies, fights

95
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,970
You see that bike there?

96
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,681
You think the guy had the balls
to say something?

97
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,362
If you wanna be something,
make sure people respect you.

98
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,048
Doesn't matter what you do,
just follow through.

99
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,047
Hey, where are the others?
I'm talking to you!

100
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,289
Where they always are.

101
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,521
Hey, we're having a party tonight.
Tell your sister!

102
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,486
Little wanker!

103
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,202
Got change!

104
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,367
Don't have any.

105
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,406
What should we do?

106
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,328
I'm off.

107
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,442
Wait a second!

108
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,763
Those bitches are boring anyway.

109
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,964
Excuse me please.
Might you have some change

110
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,210
for two needy youngsters
too weak to work?

111
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,240
We're never going to get anywhere
like that.

112
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,330
That never works,
you look like a famine victim.

113
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,684
Pay attention.
I'll show you how it works.

114
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,765
Excuse me, please.
Can you spare a bit of change?

115
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,729
That would be kind of you.

116
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,126
That's just enough for an ice cream.

117
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,324
Haven't you got any more?

118
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,050
Come on, show me!

119
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,521
Hey!

120
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,881
What's this?

121
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,242
You're taking the piss, you wanker!

122
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,409
That's enough for 10 beers
and some fags.

123
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,886
10 beers and fags!

124
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,802
You wanker!

125
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,087
Fooling me!

126
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,248
Come on, Tommek. That's enough.

127
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,801
Look at them carefully

128
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,809
with their furious mugs.

129
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,490
I'm telling you, mate.

130
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,807
What do all those weirdos want!

131
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,486
Hey, Piss off!

132
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,769
Have you got another beer?

133
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,210
Sarah really isn't so bad,
you're right.

134
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,204
Definitely got a nice tight ares,
one you can really get in to.

135
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,003
You didn't find the situation
a bit over the top?

136
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,488
I mean, the guy didn't resist.

137
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,523
We had the money already.

138
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,851
Imagine, if I didn't beat him to a pulp

139
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,046
what do you think would have happened?

140
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,046
Then it would have really kicked off.

141
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,005
He would have run and told someone.

142
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,731
Now he's so scared,
he won't say anything to anybody.

143
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,843
He can be grateful he's still alive.

144
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,050
Now you're exaggerating!

145
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,604
I'll show you something.

146
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,286
Everyone's got a taste for violence.

147
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,846
You're only free,
when you free yourself from pain.

148
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,410
Tell me

149
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,246
What's all this for?

150
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,771
Don't know. It's just tough!

151
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,486
That's complete bullshit.

152
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,287
What's with you?

153
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,051
Yeah, I just want to
You don't understand.

154
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,163
Nothing's going on here.

155
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,607
Piss off. Don't annoy me.

156
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,724
I didn't ask you to crawl up my ares,
now did I?

157
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,088
Why are you getting so wound up?

158
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,567
Piss off, don't annoy me!

159
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,481
Calm down, I didn't say anything.

160
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,328
I've got to check on my granny.

161
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,971
Check on your granny.

162
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,730
Yeah, he's got to check on his granny.

163
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,450
As opposed to you

164
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,651
Come on, I'm going now. Later.

165
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Hello, Sarah.

166
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,282
Hi.

167
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,361
What are you doing here?

168
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,245
Looking for Flo.

169
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't want him to run to Mum
and tell everything about Tommek.

170
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,010
There'd be trouble.

171
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,964
If you want, I can help you
look for him.

172
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,524
Yeah.

173
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,169
I'll just pick up some fags.
Give me a second.

174
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,684
I'm here.

175
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,167
Let's forget it.

176
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,648
Makes no sense.
I'm sure he's already home.

177
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,687
If you say so.

178
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,405
How about a fag?

179
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,763
Right, sorry.

180
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,086
How's your granny, anyway?

181
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,091
Good, great.

182
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,561
The nightshift is turning her
into a zombie.

183
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,361
I can't get why she doesn't pack it in
and put her feet up.

184
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,722
We've all got to live from something.

185
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,368
What else have you got?

186
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,567
What's with you?
- What?

187
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,526
Do you really want to start tomorrow?
- Of course.

188
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,964
And for how long?

189
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,848
Getting up every morning, going home.

190
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,931
For shit money.
That's not something for me.

191
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,088
It's not so badly paid.

192
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,251
Whatever, it's too dumb for me anyway.

193
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,767
Tommek really fucked up earlier.

194
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,248
Why can't he just leave it?

195
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,521
Yeah, but nothing happened.

196
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,211
I thought it sucked.

197
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,807
But that's how it is when you're young.

198
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,321
When I was his age,
I couldn't hang out with the older kids,

199
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,688
and that got on Tommek's tits.

200
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,889
That's not what it's about.

201
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,523
Flo was lucky
that Tommek didn't knock him flat,

202
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,127
the way he was behaving this morning.

203
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,651
Come on, let's check up on the others.

204
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,568
What's up with tonight?

205
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,485
I don't know, tomorrow's my first day.

206
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,724
Oh, it'll be fun.

207
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,446
You can go home and
sleep for a few hours.

208
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,289
We won't miss anything here.

209
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,129
We're going home to crash
for a few hours. Bye.

210
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,242
Good idea.

211
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,410
One of the women, understand?

212
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,446
I'm off. Got some stuff to take care of.

213
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,847
Sarah!

214
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,044
Sarah! Wait a minute!

215
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,848
I'm sorry about all that
with your brother.

216
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,851
Come on, I'll walk with you a bit.

217
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,124
You've got to keep your chin up.

218
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,451
Let's get 9°I"9...

219
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,688
Hello.

220
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,291
Is Sarah there?

221
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,329
No, I'll call again later.

222
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,888
Bye.

223
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,171
You see, I even walk you home
to make sure nothing happens to you.

224
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,330
I'm not as bad as everyone says.

225
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,885
I'll come upstairs if you want.

226
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,043
Your mum's definitely not there.

227
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,528
You really believe you can do
what you like to people, huh?

228
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,006
I don't think so.

229
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,849
You like me.
You just don't know it yet.

230
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,130
You're completely wasted.

231
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,084
I like women who keep me waiting.

232
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,483
The best things come to those who wait.

233
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,530
Here.

234
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,888
You can spin on this.

235
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,051
Yeah, but we haven't got that far.

236
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,966
I thought we'd go to your place first.
I'll make pancakes.

237
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,366
And read you a story.

238
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,602
Come on, don't get mad at me.

239
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,531
Everyone gets a second chance, huh?

240
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,731
Hello, I'm Sarah. I'm new here.

241
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,121
I'm Sarah.

242
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,365
Can you help Florian
with his homework?

243
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,606
Yeah, coming!

244
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,162
Hello.

245
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,129
Got something planned for tonight?

246
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,208
Yep.

247
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,323
I'm going to a cool party.

248
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,203
I'm sure you'd like it.

249
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,202
Hey, just come along.

250
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,011
It'll be cool, I promise.

251
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,366
Gotta go again.

252
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,808
Where do you want to go so late?

253
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,048
Don't stay too long, you hear?

254
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,521
Kiss each other!

255
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,449
I want to see it once.

256
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,211
Peter told me that you did it
in the loo.

257
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,724
Yeah, those two were snogging
No one saw other than Peter.

258
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,923
I really want to see it, just once.

259
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,170
Just start kissing!

260
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,687
So, did you put your granny to bed?

261
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,523
No, he was confessing at church.

262
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,208
Someone's got to do it,
considering all the shit you do.

263
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,361
Sarah, I've got to go. You coming?

264
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,006
You got a lot of catching up.

265
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,731
What shall we drink to?

266
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,085
To all this shit.

267
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,442
To the shit.

268
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,326
Come on, hurry up, I've got to go

269
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,286
That's good, I've drunk a skinful.

270
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,445
Bartek is crazy.

271
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,001
<i>HEY</i>

272
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,522
What?

273
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,722
What then?

274
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,041
To the shit.

275
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,085
Grab Tommek,

276
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,329
he's head over heels about you.

277
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,401
It'll be no problem.

278
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,447
Come on.

279
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,684
Have you got any more cigarettes?

280
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,647
No.

281
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,571
I'll go and get some.

282
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,243
I'll pick up some cigarettes.

283
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,925
I'll do it again, huh?

284
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,684
Thanks.

285
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,720
And to whomever the bottle points

286
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,682
comes with me. Those are the rules.

287
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,244
And we'll get something to drink
with the money.

288
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,045
Cool.

289
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,805
Can you hear that?

290
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,446
What?

291
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,285
You can't hear that?

292
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,207
Close your eyes and concentrate.

293
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,041
Stop that.

294
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,810
Tommek, stop that!

295
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,601
Slut!

296
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,920
Shit!

297
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,126
Where's Sarah?

298
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,446
Forget the cunt.
- What are you talking about?

299
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,649
The bitch has gone touting.

300
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,006
That's not true!

301
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,090
Don't wind me up,
otherwise there'll be bodies

302
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,811
Grow Up!

303
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,289
Where did you leave Sarah?

304
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,001
She was tired.

305
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,888
She's got her first day
at work tomorrow.

306
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,721
Tommek, stop!

307
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,720
Tommek, stop!

308
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,409
I don't want that Tommek.

309
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,723
Go away!

310
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,322
You want to murder someone?

311
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,369
I bet you couldn't do it.

312
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,365
Where were you?

313
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,729
Did you see how they were all staring?

314
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,087
Yeah.

315
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,604
No one said a word.

316
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,807
They all thought it was great.

317
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,131
I need something more to drink.

318
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,450
That shouldn't be
the slightest of problems.

319
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,563
Come on!
- Let's go to work.

320
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,086
Wicked.

321
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,088
It doesn't matter who.

322
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,246
The next one had better believe.

323
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,767
Hey, where are the others?

324
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,487
Hey, I'm talking to you!

325
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,045
Adam and Tommek want to kill someone.

326
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,080
What? Who?

327
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,921
I don't think it matters.

328
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,447
Where's Ella?

329
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,450
No idea. She went after Anna.

330
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,206
Now piss off!

331
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,720
We're closed.

332
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,285
We'll pay well.

333
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,686
Closed!

334
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,441
Can't you make an exception for us?

335
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,321
He's got money.

336
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,762
Thanks.

337
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,168
I'd like a bottle of vodka.

338
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,651
Are you even 18?

339
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,720
Of course.

340
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,687
So cool!

341
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,166
Here's the bottle.

342
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,845
Igor, get some vodka!

343
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,605
Closed!

344
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,085
We're closed!

345
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,764
What do you want?

346
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,931
Great, huh?

347
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,921
We should've done it there and then.

348
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,730
It wouldn't have worked with the stone.

349
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,887
Have a swig.

350
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,524
The others really think
we're going to do it.

351
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,281
This stuff has no effect.

352
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,841
Cool.

353
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,410
Are you crazy?

354
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,607
Hey you!

355
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,770
Got a cigarette?

356
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,123
Have you got one or not?

357
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,048
Come on.

358
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,166
Tommek!

359
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,328
Come on!

360
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,207
Come on, let's go!

361
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,208
Did you see what I did?

362
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,005
We've got to tell the others.

363
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,201
He's not dead.

364
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,124
We'll find another one.

365
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,810
The guy wasn't dead.

366
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,810
We just left him there.

367
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,647
Didn't matter.

368
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,167
200 metres away we met the next one.

369
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,845
Be quiet, you'll wake everyone up!

370
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,329
It was so easy.

371
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,040
21, 22, 23, 24

372
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,402
You got another fag?

373
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,803
I'm not cold at all.

374
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,608
Tommek?

375
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,002
Here you are!

376
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,607
Are you stupid? Where were you?

377
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,727
Don't wind me up!

378
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,686
That's already the second time
you disappeared.

379
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,330
What's wrong with you? Look at you!

380
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,164
Cool huh, blood brothers.

381
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,728
Can't you see what I'm doing?
- No, I'm blind!

382
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,651
You're making it dirty again.
- I am? - Yeah!

383
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,481
What?

384
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,929
I just don't want to get busted.

385
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,248
Why are you worrying?
You didn't do anything.

386
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,485
Look at you, look at me.
Do you notice anything?

387
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,086
You've got no idea.

388
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,481
I'll tell the others.

389
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,565
I already did that ages ago.

390
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,561
What! Let me tell you something, mate!

391
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,731
You just talk shit the whole time,
it makes me crazy.

392
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,920
Hey arseholel I'm talking to you!

393
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,889
Watch out you little wanker.

394
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,680
You little bastard!

395
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,762
Piss off!

396
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,402
Get out, piss off!

397
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,403
Shit!

398
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,563
Shut it!

399
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,284
What then, you or what?

400
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,962
Hey come on, yeah.
Like that? You too?

401
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,367
You, huh?

402
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,602
What then?

403
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,726
You, huh?

404
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,809
Another one?

405
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,690
Get up! Get up!

406
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,924
I was completely calm.

407
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,329
I saw everything clearly.

408
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,010
That was my moment.

409
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,251
You have a second?

410
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,731
Here. Some leftover soup.

411
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,763
Sarah?

412
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,608
Hey, Sarah!

413
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,286
It was me.

414
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,966
I did it.

415
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,481
Alone.

416
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,045
Tommek was just standing there.

417
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,844
Give the bag to me!

418
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,808
There's just shit in the bag!

419
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,200
L_6t'$ QQ!

420
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,162
Come on!

421
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,729
And take your jewellery off

422
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,850
They got Tommek a few hours later.

423
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,726
He was still at the railway station
preparing his getaway.

424
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,083
Tommek.

425
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,442
Hey, Tommek!

426
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,681
Hey, Tommek!

427
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,488
Tommek!

428
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,442
We spent the first few days
in the same prison.

429
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:48,042
Then they said we had a bad influence
on the other prisoners,

430
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,161
we demoralised them.

431
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,610
So they separated us.

432
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,007
I only saw Tommek once again
at the hearing.

433
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,641
Come, please.

434
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,642
Come on.

435
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,406
Who is that?

436
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,850
That's not my Adam!

437
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,084
Look at that, all these drawings.

438
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,125
Why did you do that?

439
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:51,409
Some day it'll all be forgotten,
and what will you do?

440
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,804
When you get out, you'll always carry
your past with you.

441
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,521
Whenever I visited my son,
he always looked clean and tidy.

442
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,285
He didn't look bad.

443
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,768
What were you thinking?

444
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,770
Don't you want to talk to
your granny?

445
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,801
Daily life here?

446
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,362
Well, I get up at half six,

447
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,929
then there's roll call,

448
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,367
then coffee,

449
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,563
then a bit of a stroll,

450
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,360
play cards, we watch TV

451
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,082
and then it's time for lunch.

452
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,442
In the afternoons we work out

453
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,287
and then it's evening already.

454
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,043
Is there no one who takes care of you?

455
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,964
Grew up with his grandmother.

456
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,691
His father is in jail.

457
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:12,961
And his mother?

458
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,251
You can forget her.

459
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,409
How many people do you share
your cell with?

460
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,605
How long do you think you'll stay here?

461
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,482
No idea.

462
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,043
If you could, would you try to
reverse what you did?

463
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:43,207
After months in detention and
a prison for juveniles,

464
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,008
Adam C. and Tommek K. were sentenced
to 25 years in prison.

465
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,442
At the time of their of fence
they were 16.

466
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,924
Because of the particularly gruesome
nature of their crimes,

467
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,409
they were sentenced to adult terms
despite being minors.

468
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:03,287
In the proceedings, both requested
being treated as chief perpetrator.
