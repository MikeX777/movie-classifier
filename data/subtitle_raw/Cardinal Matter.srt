00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,339
Son of a bitch.

00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,706
Mr. Ryan.

11
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,408
Yeah.

I got these guys on videotape...

14
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,783
I only use hard copies.

15
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,187
Okay.

16
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,590
I got a folder. Hold on.

17
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,601
They're local guys.

18
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,902
They have records.

19
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,641
My supplies.

20
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,245
Yeah.

21
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,784
This is it?

22
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,620
That'll be enough.

23
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,624
Will it now?

24
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:42,327
Look.

25
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,530
This is what you get.

26
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,231
All right?

27
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,368

Yes, sir.

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,482

Hunter?

47
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,002
I'm not here to sit anymore.

48
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,704
So, what?

49
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,373
You're just gonna run
off like you always do?

50
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,885
You're just gonna
leave him in jail?

51
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,589
It's not my problem.

52
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,758
He's your boyfriend.
You go get him.

53
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,727
It's because of you
that he bailed.

54
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,428
I'm not gonna get
locked up with him.

55
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,763
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

56
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,498
Please man up and deal
with it, asshole!

57
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,472
- You okay.
- Who the fuck are you?

58
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,940
I'm Austin.

59
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,775
Who the fuck are you?

60
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,377
I forgot you were coming.

61
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,579
- That's hunter's cousin.
- Great.

62
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,813
He can go get him then.

63
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,917
Where's hunter?

64
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,956
- He got himself arrested.
- You got him arrested.

65
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,457
What'd he get locked up for?

66
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,026
A possession with
intent to distribute.

67
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,028
- It's just weed.
- That does not matter.

68
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,798
You guys were dealing.
You go get him.

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,601
Dipshit should've run faster.

70
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,836
Oh, my...

71
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,705
You know what?

72
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:47,706
I'll get him.

73
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,408
Great.

74
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,910
Thanks, bro.

75
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,480
Yeah.

76
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,423
Where's the police station at?

77
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,424
Sheriff's station.

78
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,792
It's right on the street

79
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:11,196
- in the middle of town.
- And what about bail?

80
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,031
I'm running a little
light right now.

81
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,213
This is the last of it.

82
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,915
Tell him that.

83
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,185
Okay.

84
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,189
- You must be Mary.
- Yeah.

85
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,563
So, I'll be gone
whenever you get back.

86
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,997
So, welcome to town.

87
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,586
What can I do for you, sir?

88
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,687
Uh...

89
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,591
I'm here to bail
out hunter blum.

90
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:16,761
What relates you to Mr. Blum?

91
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,163
I'm just here to bail him out.

92
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,771
That don't answer my question.

93
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,874
He's my cousin.

94
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,542
Got a bond?

95
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,747
Cash.

96
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,621
I.d., please.

97
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,900
Austin blum.

98
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,538
License is expired.

99
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,275
Is that a problem?

100
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,810
Only if you want to
collect your cousin.

101
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,933
Go on and get hunter.

102
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,290
- You want me to check
with the sheriff

103
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,669
first... -won't be necessary.

104
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,245
Thank you for your service.

105
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,687
So, what brings you to town?

106
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,356
I'm just looking for a job.

107
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,028
Word is the agriculture
plant is closing.

108
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,638
Be mindful of the folks
you associate with.

109
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,340
Understand?

110
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,644
Hey, cuz.

111
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,213
Hey, man.

112
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,727
Oh, shit.

113
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,231
Where're you goin'?

114
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,833
You know where.

115
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,836
- Just come inside.
- I got nothin' to say.

116
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,704
Look, I'm sorry 'bout
gettin' arrested.

117
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,973
- All right...
- It isn't just about that.

118
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:49,347
Look, you draw too much
attention to yourself.

119
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,216
That stuff it doesn't
just go missing.

120
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,218
Someone is gonna
be looking for it.

121
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
I got it under control.

122
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,725
Just please, just
don't come looking

123
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,227
for me this time.

124
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,362
Please.

125
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,018
Sorry about that.

126
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,454
- You okay?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,990
Guess I ain't that
easy to live with.

128
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,191
You know, uh...

129
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,363
Don't ask me why, man, but
she loves me, you know?

130
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,967
Yeah, she does this.

131
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,103
I piss her off and
she goes camping up

132
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,738
by diamond Ridge.

133
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,710
I'll go find her tomorrow.

134
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,347
Sounded to me like she, uh,

135
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,049
wanted to be left alone.

136
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,317
Nah, she'll cool off.

137
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,286
Always does.

138
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,822
Then we do a lot of makin' up.

139
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,192
So, you'll get the place
to yourself for a day.

140
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,162
We're lookin' kinda dry, though.

141
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,298
You want to, uh... You
wanna hit the bar?

142
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,334
You know what I
really need is a job.

143
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,471
- Yeah? What kinda job?
- Yeah.

144
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,439
Ranch. Garage.

145
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,978
Thing is I need it to pay cash.

146
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,147
What kinda work you
do over in Iraq?

147
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,448
Afghanistan.

148
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,354
Mostly convoy. Guard duty.

149
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,357
You shoot anybody?

150
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,230
You okay with that?

151
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,771
Come on, let's uh, let's
go talk to dusty.

152
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,273
- Dusty?
- Yeah, my business partner.

153
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,810
- Yeah, we met.
- Awesome.

154
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,111
I think we can hook you up.

155
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,282
Great. Let's go meet dusty.

156
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,535
Dusty, you home?

157
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,949
What?

158
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,853
What're you doing?

159
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,154
Shut up!

160
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,366
Holy shit.

161
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,302
- Holy shit, dusty...
- Don't touch him.

162
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,170
Don't fuckin' touch anything.

163
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,111
We walked in on somethin'.

164
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,613
You fuckin' think?

165
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,581
We gotta call the police.

166
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,550
Shit. Shit.

167
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,455
- Holy shit!
- What?

168
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,125
- The case isn't here.
- What case?

169
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,296
Fuck!

170
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,934
We cannot be here.

171
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,440
Come on.

172
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,313
Holy shit.

173
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,919
- I'd have to say cheesecake.
- Cheesecake?

174
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,287
I don't know if I know
how to make that.

175
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,122
- I'm gonna learn.
- Afternoon everyone.

176
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,590
Afternoon, rich.

177
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,592
Ms. Walker here
brought us a pie.

178
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,128
What's the occasion?

179
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,496
Carroll agricultural technology

180
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,198
has officially
closed shop in town.

181
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,068
I'll be sticking around
to tie up loose ends,

182
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,671
but at the end of the week
they're transferring me

183
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,974
to the public relations
department at the home office.

184
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,475
Congratulations.

185
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,313
Gonna be sorry to see you go.

186
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,682
Well, I'm gonna miss you guys.

187
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,150
This town.

188
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,252
Everything.

189
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,254
Something wrong, rich?

190
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:00,058
Just lookin' forward to things
getting back to normal.

191
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,060
Since you people been in town,

192
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,729
we've had more fights,
drugs, and what have you...

193
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,364
Than any year in the past.

194
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,399
We all know the numbers, rich.

195
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,601
Well, I'm sorry if
you've had a little more

196
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,237
on your plate, but the
people around here

197
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,739
- needed jobs.
- Weren't the people

198
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,541
around here getting the jobs?

199
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,078
Why don't you go
ahead and punch out?

200
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,146
You've had a long day.

201
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,337
- Start explaining.
- I don't...

202
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,006
That was a hit.

203
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,344
You saw it. Someone broke in.

204
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,079
- Someone broke in to...
- Noose lying there.

205
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,581
Wire wrapped around his neck.

206
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,117
That's supposed to look
like suicide, hunter.

207
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,386
Oh, my god.

208
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,488
Tell me about that case
you were looking for.

209
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,055
Breathe.

210
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,356
Breathe.

211
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,071
This is why dusty got killed.

212
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,822
It took us a while to
figure out the combination.

213
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,590
What, you knock off a
hospital or somethin'?

214
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,092
Hell no!

215
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,531
You know that company
that got in town?

216
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,700
Karen or whatever?

217
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,836
It's like alternative
energy or something.

218
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,209
Me and dusty hear they
got these trailers

219
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,543
full of chemicals.

220
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,811
Chemicals?

221
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,583
We were lookin' to cook.

222
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,118
Meth?

223
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,419
Mm.

224
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,589
That's pretty smart.

225
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,864
And you were gonna get me
involved in that shit?

226
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,866
Look, you said you
needed the work.

227
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,568
As long as it pays, right?

228
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,504
I figured you being
family and all.

229
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,808
- What is it?
- Man, I have no idea.

230
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,676
Well.

231
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,513
Where exactly did you find it?

232
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,385
So, we hear they
got these trailers

233
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,586
full of chemicals, right?

234
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,321
We go and take us a look.

235
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,539
Who else knows about this?

236
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,344
Shit.

237
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,518
- Who else?
- No one.

238
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,353
- Mm.
- Look!

239
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,355
I swear.

240
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,324
Okay, we didn't know
what to do with it.

241
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,563
So, you're tellin'
me you have no idea

242
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,499
what this shit is.

243
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,702
No. Man, it's... it's like
from outer-fucking-space.

244
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,705
- You tried it?
- Dusty did.

245
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,508
Look, we were buzzed off
the heist and he just...

246
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,376
He just gave it a go.

247
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,645
Look, I don't need this
shit, man, I don't.

248
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,480
Just watch this.

249
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,718
What...

250
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,422
Hunter?

251
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,627
Hunter?

252
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,901
What're you doin'?

253
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,236
What're you... no!

254
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,381
You got another line?

255
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,855
Not gonna get much of
a chance to do this

256
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,990
after I leave.

257
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:07,031
This thing's always been broken.

258
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,532
It's not broke.

259
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,468
You just don't know
how to use it.

260
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,014
When I first got to town i...

261
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,950
I don't know, I thought I'd
be out here more often.

262
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,294
God, I'm gonna miss this place.

263
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,062
Then why are you leavin'?

264
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,434
This isn't my world.

265
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,069
I can't stay here forever.

266
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,006
Besides, I'm in my 30s.

267
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,742
I'm ready for the big leagues.

268
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,545
Isn't 40 like the new
20 or something?

269
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,689
Just...

270
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,628
Take care of yourself.

271
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,034
You, too.

272
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,377
What the fuck?

273
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,346
I know, right?

274
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,850
Seriously, man. What the fuck?

275
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,721
Dusty's hand got
sliced in the heist.

276
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,724
And when he tried this...

277
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,991
Poof.

278
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,126
Just gone.

279
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,730
I decided to try it myself.

280
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,866
I cut myself to ribbons.

281
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,468
I got no scars or nothin'.

282
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,741
You wanna try?

283
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,744
No, I don't think so.

284
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,012
Well, here.

285
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,749
Take a poke.

286
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:08,452
Are you serious?

287
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,589
Yeah, I'm serious.

288
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,524
Come on, before it wears off.

289
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:20,164
Boo. Pussy.

290
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:29,440
It's a nice little buzz
to top it all off, too.

291
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,776
- We gotta go.
- Dusty tried two at once.

292
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,478
- He was trippin' balls.
- We gotta go right now.

293
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,814
- What?
- Now.

294
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,817
Shit. Mary. We gotta go get her.

295
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,819
- You know where she is?
- Yeah, diamond Ridge.

296
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,687
Like I said, that's her place.

297
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,490
All right, fine. Lead the way.

298
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,107
You're fine, man. All
right, stay calm.

299
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,676
Brother, you're fine. How
do you use one of these?

300
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,546
We'll get to her. I
promise, all right?

301
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,749
Eyes on me, man!

302
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,050
Eyes on me, hunter!

303
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,054
Hunter?

304
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,700
There was someone
else with blum.

305
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,971
And...

306
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,243
And he got away.

307
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,011
So, you failed.

308
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,147
I will handle...

309
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:27,084
This should have
already been handled.

310
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,659
How much have you used?

311
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,928
Enough to get the job done.

312
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,864
You're creating an em field.

313
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:44,868
- How much have you used?
- All of it.

314
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,171
That's why I need
to be resupplied.

315
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:50,674
You were given a
three-day supply.

316
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,645
When's the last time you used?

317
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,684
- Last night.
- And you're already sore?

318
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,953
Is, uh...

319
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,254
Is that it?

320
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,060
I don't want you to overdo it.

321
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,868
I expect much better of
you from here on out.

322
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,142
Go make this right.

323
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,891
Have yourself a little party?

324
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,229
Mrs. Kitner called
about a trespasser

325
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,898
sleeping in her shed.

326
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,069
Gonna need you to stand up.

327
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,783
You hurt?

328
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,888
- What?
- I said are you injured?

329
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,064
- Guess not. -You got any
weapons or drugs on you?

330
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,447
You have the right
to remain silent.

331
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,202
Wanna tell me whose
blood that is?

332
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,848
What about what was
in that needle.

333
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,958
Gonna find out anyway, son.

334
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,260
Drug test.

335
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,398
What am I gonna find
when I open that case?

336
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,013
Boy was stoned out of his mind.

337
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,481
Come in, sheriff.

338
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,053
Go ahead, Pete.

339
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,123
We got a hell of a
mess over here.

340
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,130
I can't believe it.

341
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,002
Figure his cousin did it?

342
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,138
I do not know.

343
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,476
Seems likely, if you ask me.

344
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,145
I didn't.

345
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,416
Thoughts, sheriff.

346
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,954
Yeah, I got a few.

347
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,922
Sheriff, come in.

348
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,424
Go ahead.

349
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,092
Got a call about a body.

350
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,996
Already there.

351
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:10,133
No, sheriff, you're not.

352
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,305
Figure they're connected?

353
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,974
Yeah, I do.

354
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,347
What're the odds he
was gonna off himself

355
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:26,516
and someone beat
him to the punch?

356
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,018
Sheriff?

357
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,055
Yeah, go ahead.

358
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,524
You're not gonna
believe this, but...

359
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,400
Think I found the murder weapon.

360
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,068
I reckon you did.

361
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,153
- Sheriff? -You gotta
be fuckin' kiddin' me.

362
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,222
We need you back
at the first one.

363
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,324
What's going on today?
Where is everyone?

364
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:08,558
Well, ma'am,

365
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,093
today's been a bit
of a shitstorm.

366
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,262
- Excuse my language.
- How so?

367
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,264
I don't want to
alarm you, but, uh,

368
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,234
- a few people got murdered.
- Oh, my god.

369
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,568
I know we're supposed to notify

370
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,671
family first and all,
but looks like one

371
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,072
of the bodies was someone

372
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:25,142
- who used to work for you.
- What?

373
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:28,078
Fellow by the name of Ryan.

374
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,648
- Jeremy Ryan.
- Jeremy?

375
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,650
He left town days ago.

376
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,485
I wish that was true, ma'am.

377
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,589
You know what?

378
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:43,327
He looks a little familiar.

379
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,495
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

380
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,998
He might've been one of
my guys at the plant.

381
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,501
You think I could
speak with him?

382
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,403
Ms. Walker, I don't want to get

383
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,538
in any trouble, and, you know,

384
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,639
I don't want to put you

385
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,274
- in harms way.
- Of course not.

386
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,476
I was just thinking that
maybe I could help.

387
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,579
You know, I have his
file and his resume.

388
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,514
That could be useful
information for you.

389
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,055
You make it quick and you
keep this between us, okay?

390
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,658
Our secret.

391
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,672
It's gonna be fine.

392
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,443
It'll be fine.

393
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,146
I'll be right outside
if you need me, ma'am.

394
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,614
Thank you.

395
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,790
Did you use any of it?

396
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:49,159
The syringe, did
you use any of it?

397
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,629
You have. I can tell.

398
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,666
Do you have any idea
what that stuff will do

399
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,402
without proper treatment?

400
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,571
It's ugly.

401
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,473
Who are you?

402
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,808
I'm the person who's
gonna make this

403
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,476
a lot easier on you.

404
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,247
What do you want?

405
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,716
I just want back the
product that was stolen.

406
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,720
You killed my cousin.

407
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,739
Well, you know I didn't.

408
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,442
But you know who did.

409
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:41,144
See now, we're
getting off topic.

410
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,480
Because you need to understand

411
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:47,284
this substance that you've used,

412
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,719
you're not gonna last
long without it.

413
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,688
How's that?

414
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,125
Well, it doesn't last forever.

415
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,794
Whatever hole that
you've plugged,

416
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,764
in a couple days,
it's coming back.

417
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,768
So...

418
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,805
You help me

419
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,474
and I'll help you.

420
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,391
God damn it, boy!

421
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:32,162
Get out! Get out! Go!

422
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,444
Ms. Walker, are you okay, ma'am?

423
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,184
Well, we found this
stored out back.

424
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,719
I figured these boys
were looking to cook up

425
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,621
some crystal,

426
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,756
but we also found this inside.

427
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,504
That is familiar.

428
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,544
A little fancy for some junkies.

429
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,879
Where you figure
they're getting these?

430
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,781
My best guess is the same place

431
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,216
they're getting these chemicals.

432
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,287
Barrel's got carroll
stamps on it.

433
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,394
Yes, sir. I understand.

434
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:39,529
I... I shoulda never
let her in that...

435
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,398
Yes, sir.

436
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,799
Again, I'm... I'm sorry.

437
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,769
I understand.

438
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,270
All right.

439
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,675
God damn.

440
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,770
God damn it, blum!

441
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,410
Don't move.

442
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,611
Don't move, blum!

443
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:35,945
Don't move!

444
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,435
Son of a bitch.

445
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,222
What the hell happened to you?

446
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,860
Where's hunter?

447
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,733
He's, uh...

448
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,868
What did you do to him?

449
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,110
I didn't hurt him.

450
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,779
I swear to god.

451
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:33,283
This guy showed up, he, uh...

452
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:35,318
He just stabbed him.

453
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,689
Look, hunter got into that stuff

454
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,958
you guys took last week.

455
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,793
Someone came for it.

456
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,064
His friend's dead, too.

457
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,066
Dusty?

458
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,270
Yeah, I barely got away.
The cops think I did it.

459
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,609
I'm sorry.

460
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,315
Who do I need to speak with
to get his records released?

461
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:07,951
- Yeah, if I could just get your name.
- No, I spoke to him yesterday.

462
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:12,055
- He forwarded me to you.
- Hannah? Patricia?

463
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:15,792
- Ms. Walker, thank you for coming.
- B-l-u-m.

464
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:19,362
- Ms. Walker?
- But, um...

465
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,863
Of course, I will hold.

466
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,300
Yes, ma'am.

467
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:28,171
I'll have a deputy
look into that.

468
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,839
Want to explain to me

469
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,774
how you can lose an
entire drum of chemicals

470
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,977
and not notice?

471
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:37,347
Well, there was a
break-in last week.

472
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:39,215
Why didn't you report it?

473
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,651
I actually didn't know about
it at the time, rich.

474
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,386
That was the head of
security's responsibility.

475
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,855
The recently deceased Mr. Ryan?

476
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,056
Yes.

477
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,929
What the hell is
she doing in here?

478
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,632
Just asking a few questions.

479
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,635
- Erin, I'm sorry, please.
- It's okay.

480
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:01,304
I wanna know why
someone who spends

481
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,173
so much time at the
local sheriff's office

482
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,976
failed to report a pretty
significant crime.

483
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,144
Deputy, watch what you say.

484
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,079
A crime now linked
to four bodies.

485
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,948
- Shut your mouth.
- It's fine.

486
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,083
No, it ain't.

487
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,219
No, it ain't.

488
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,991
Ms. Walker, if you'll excuse us.

489
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,394
I'll be with you
outside in a minute.

490
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,965
Four bodies in one day.

491
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,933
That's more than all last year.

492
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,870
For god's sakes, sir.

493
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,706
Jed was killed here last night.

494
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:43,112
You don't have to
remind me about jed.

495
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:46,449
I know what's going through
your mind right now.

496
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:47,984
These guys ripped
off her warehouse

497
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:51,120
and she doesn't report it?

498
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,356
Her head of security
was beaten to death

499
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,224
- just outside of town.
- Rich,

500
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,260
we will look into
those connections.

501
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:58,728
I want to know what
you're thinking

502
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,029
bringing her in here.

503
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,898
If she files a lawsuit,

504
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,300
it won't be just your
ass gettin' pissed on.

505
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,075
Do you know if it
was somebody else,

506
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:14,744
- you wouldn't... -i ain't
some heartsick teenager.

507
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,815
I'm doing my job.

508
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,352
Then do it smart.

509
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,787
Find Austin blum.

510
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,326
Yeah.

511
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:31,828
So, what now?

512
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,864
You have a cell phone?

513
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:37,366
- Yeah.
- Take it apart.

514
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:40,970
Sim card, battery.
Throw it in the fire.

515
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,809
How many days are
you supplied for?

516
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:50,046
A week, maybe,

517
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:52,982
- between the two of us.
- Nah, I'm leaving.

518
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:55,451
And you're coming with me.

519
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:58,821
- Hunter would've wanted it that way.
- He did this to himself.

520
00:45:58,823 --> 00:45:59,956
Not me.

521
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,796
That's his blood.

522
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,399
You were involved in this.

523
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,169
And because of
you, I'm involved.

524
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:17,039
Now, we have an
opportunity to leave

525
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:18,508
and we need to take it.

526
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,944
Both of us.

527
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,422
Sorry.

528
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,096
Maybe we turn ourselves
in to the sheriff.

529
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,500
We didn't kill nobody.

530
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:46,869
That woman, she's...

531
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:48,204
She's got some kind
of relationship

532
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:50,473
with the sheriff's department.

533
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,141
You can't trust them.

534
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,183
- Where are we gonna run to?
- Nowhere.

535
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:02,852
If we keep moving
they can't catch us.

536
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,590
You found me.

537
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,601
You know how to use this thing?

538
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,271
Yeah.

539
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,247
Watch over that case.

540
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,619
Where're you going?

541
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,557
Going to talk to
the company lady.

542
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,259
That case is the only thing

543
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:46,195
that's gonna keep us alive.

544
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,464
I'm gonna make a deal.

545
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,366
Are you sure that's a good idea?

546
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,470
Yeah, I'll be convincing.

547
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,958
Going somewhere?

548
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,363
What happened with the cousin?

549
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:23,032
Let's just say he's, um...

550
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,603
Resourceful.

551
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,911
You were hired to
put out this fire.

552
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,348
Well, sometimes you've got
to throw dynamite onto it

553
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,317
to blow it out.

554
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:49,258
I've got everything
under control.

555
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,204
Where're you going?

556
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:03,506
I...

557
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,478
It's the deputy.
He isn't stupid.

558
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,013
He knows carroll's involved.

559
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:14,517
Does he need to be dealt with?

560
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,154
- I don't know if that's...
- You know...

561
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,995
The cleanup list...

562
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:31,233
- Is getting long.
- Well, things come up.

563
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,437
- We need to be...
- Flexible?

564
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,508
Yeah.

565
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,010
That's right.

566
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,220
You...

567
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,659
Will stay in this town

568
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,262
until the job is done.

569
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,398
What about the deputy?

570
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,336
I'm supposed to be transferring

571
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,206
to the home office at
the end of the week.

572
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,510
Well, it will be done by then.

573
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,186
Nobody leaves.

574
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:32,128
Anybody involved

575
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,463
in any way...

576
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,301
They don't leave.

577
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,440
What is this stuff?

578
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,409
Progress.

579
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:47,743
Progress?

580
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,278
Oh, I've heard that before.

581
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,149
Yeah, well, progress
comes with a cost.

582
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,818
What is it?

583
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,155
I can't tell you with
a gun in my chest.

584
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:10,066
It's supposed to
make people better.

585
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,201
At least for a short time.

586
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,306
It's a cocktail.

587
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,809
Hormones, synthetic
nerve conductors,

588
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:21,077
nanotechnology.

589
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,645
Honestly,

590
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:25,147
it's too difficult to explain
to someone like you.

591
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:26,849
Someone like me?

592
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:30,186
Don't get offended. I don't
understand it either.

593
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:31,687
Cell size robots

594
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,390
that can rebuild you after
getting shot to pieces.

595
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,258
Who figures that out, huh?

596
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,393
Why?

597
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,363
It's a military contract.

598
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:44,867
- It's supposed to save lives.
- Are you telling me

599
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:46,635
that my government
killed my cousin?

600
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:48,804
No, I'm telling you
that Cale did.

601
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:52,708
You see that?

602
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,445
That's the electromagnetic field

603
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,847
this stuff creates.

604
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,683
Anything electronic
gets real unreliable.

605
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:03,152
We had a hell of a time
trying to fix that.

606
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,256
Austin.

607
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,826
You're in trouble.

608
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,303
And you're not?

609
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,773
It's a whole different
kind of trouble.

610
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,643
We didn't have enough time to
long-term test this stuff.

611
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,912
And judging by Cale,

612
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:32,448
it seems like there are
some serious side effects

613
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,416
to brain chemistry, huh?

614
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:37,386
This stuff is gonna
put a hole in you.

615
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,423
But it doesn't have to.

616
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,695
Cale is the problem.

617
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:49,899
You said so yourself.
He scares me.

618
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:51,600
And if you're smart,

619
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:54,803
- he should scare you, too.
- I just wanna survive.

620
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,173
- Okay?
- Yeah?

621
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:58,641
Me, too.

622
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,213
Listen, Cale...

623
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:05,881
Cale isn't easy.

624
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:08,417
I like easy.

625
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:10,553
Let's make this easy
for the both of us.

626
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,858
You bring me the
remaining product.

627
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,526
I get you the help you need.

628
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,730
What about Cale?

629
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,201
I'll handle Cale.

630
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,669
Mm-hmm.

631
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,373
I can save you, Austin.

632
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,343
You just have to do the
right thing first.

633
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,419
Diamond Ridge. It's
north of town.

634
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:45,487
You meet me there
tomorrow morning,

635
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,656
and I'll get you the case.

636
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:48,824
Done.

637
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,694
Mm-hmm.

638
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,604
Morning, rich.

639
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:11,440
Pete. Coffee?

640
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:13,976
Nah, I'm good.

641
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,744
How's the office?

642
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,513
Still a shitstorm.

643
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,316
Yeah.

644
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,384
Background check came back
on your perp, though.

645
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,720
Figured you'd wanna
check it out.

646
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:28,357
Austin blum. Corporal U.S.
marine corp.

647
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:29,892
Been awol for six months.

648
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,761
Yeah, he took leave for
his mom's funeral,

649
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:36,365
but just never came back.

650
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,436
Got a couple misdemeanors
from when he was a kid,

651
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,104
but that's about it.

652
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:43,539
Yeah.

653
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,942
How's the sheriff?

654
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:51,914
Still pissed as all hell about Ms.
Walker.

655
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,415
Yeah.

656
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,052
Thanks for bringing this by.

657
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:58,620
Yeah, no problem.

658
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,590
About to cook us some trout.

659
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,759
- Stay for lunch?
- Nah, I gotta get back.

660
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:07,796
- But thank you, though.
- I'll be in this afternoon.

661
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,666
Hey, do me a favor.

662
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:12,968
Grab some wood for my
stove before you leave.

663
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,887
A bomb detonated in
Bagdad has killed 17

664
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,822
and wounded at least 50.

665
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:35,524
Security forces have been...

666
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,662
though no one has
claimed responsibility

667
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:43,432
for the attack, they have leads

668
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,567
and are following
them aggressively.

669
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,409
How did it go?

670
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,810
Where's the case?

671
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,448
What happened?

672
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,784
I met with her and she
wants to make a deal.

673
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,988
And you believe her?

674
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,756
Yes.

675
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,932
Please, I need it.

676
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,102
What kind of deal did you make?

677
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,070
Just give me the case.

678
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,607
No.

679
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:32,080
I am way past fucking
around here right now.

680
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,221
Not until you tell me

681
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:42,224
what the hell is going on.

682
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:43,926
I'm giving it to Erin.

683
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:45,828
Okay, so you're gonna
give it to Erin.

684
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,095
And then just hope

685
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:48,797
that everything's gonna be okay?

686
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,566
Look, you don't get a
vote in this, all right?

687
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:52,000
It's your dumb ass
that got me involved.

688
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,803
If you go down there...

689
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,973
No one is gonna see you again.

690
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,158
What?

691
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,160
I'm in the area.

692
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,895
I'll let you know.

693
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:29,071
I don't wanna die.

694
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:01,236
She told me I have
to keep taking it.

695
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,071
Or I'll die.

696
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,242
And no, I don't fully trust her,

697
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,111
but...

698
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:12,114
I don't know who else
can help me right now.

699
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:27,162
- It's him.
- What?

700
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:30,132
- We have to go.
- How'd he find us?

701
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:32,301
You got to tell me
where that case is.

702
00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:33,969
He can't find it.

703
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,357
I put it right over here.

704
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,725
I put it right down over here,

705
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,293
just below the...

706
00:59:58,295 --> 00:59:59,828
- No!
- What?

707
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,296
No, no! The rope fell in.

708
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:03,632
- Can you slide down there?
- No way.

709
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:06,768
Over there. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,706
Keep trying.

711
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,078
Lower it all the way down there.

712
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,116
Okay.

713
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,784
- Shit!
- Again.

714
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,155
Little right.

715
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:30,826
Yeah, now. Slow.

716
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:32,060
Aah.

717
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,311
- Let's go.
- Did you get it all?

718
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,146
Got enough. Let's move, come on.

719
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,980
- Shh!
- What the hell are you doin'?

720
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:26,448
- Shh.
- You get back in your house.

721
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,050
- You stay quiet.
- No, no.

722
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,187
Hey! Don't answer the
door for nobody.

723
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,165
Sheriff's department.

724
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,933
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,401
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

726
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,741
All right, we'll be right there.

727
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,076
What was that?

728
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:56,745
Austin blum just took
a family hostage.

729
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,958
God damn it.

730
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,426
You think he saw us?

731
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:38,086
Come on.

732
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,222
Rich, where the
hell are you goin'?

733
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,991
Just spotted blum.

734
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:44,493
Why don't you head
toward the junkyard?

735
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:45,994
Head to the front gate.

736
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:03,734
- Did you see a man come through

737
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:05,113
here? -Yeah, they went that way.

738
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,182
- They?
- Man and a woman.

739
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,289
Turn your radios off. You
don't want to spook 'em.

740
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,291
Keep a line of sight
with each other.

741
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,426
No one approaches them alone.

742
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,123
Come on.

743
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,963
- Take the case.
- What about you?

744
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:57,465
- I'll be fine.
- Like hell you will.

745
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,969
If something happens to me you
tell everyone about this.

746
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,287
Rich?

747
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,622
Rich?

748
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,033
Cale.

749
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:31,486
- Rich!
- Go after them.

750
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,588
- Not without backup.
- They're getting away!

751
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,724
You should've waited for me.

752
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,572
There was another man with blum.

753
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:51,639
Did you get a good look?

754
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:55,176
Nah. His face was covered.

755
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,214
What the hell are
we doing, sheriff?

756
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:01,549
Bring Erin Walker
in for questioning.

757
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,518
We can't do that.

758
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,488
You blew that option when you
brought her into the station.

759
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:13,161
When did you turn
into such a coward?

760
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:16,364
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

761
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:22,370
What the hell is going on?

762
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,808
Sheriff?

763
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,493
Be with you in just a minute.

764
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,675
Rich.

765
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,851
I almost got killed today.

766
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,521
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

767
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,358
Are you?

768
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,767
Pete's hurt...

769
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:33,935
but he'll be fine.

770
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,674
Just thought you'd like to know.

771
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,211
Be careful.

772
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:49,417
The suspects are
still on the loose.

773
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,380
You know...

774
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,219
She called me a failure.

775
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,557
Can you believe that?

776
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:42,837
I... I'm good at
what I do, you know?

777
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,912
Thing is,

778
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:54,282
people like her don't
understand how...

779
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:57,252
How you've got to
think on the fly.

780
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,890
Something doesn't go
according to plan,

781
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:06,261
you act like a professional
and you adjust.

782
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,600
With her...

783
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,302
Something goes wrong

784
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:17,438
and she just starts pointing
the fingers, blaming.

785
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:34,022
She just wants to
slash and burn.

786
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,695
But she doesn't know
how to slash and burn.

787
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:51,372
This job is stressful, you know?

788
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,744
Most people couldn't
handle it, mm-mm.

789
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,848
But I can handle it.

790
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:09,390
I show up to the third Mark,
someone else is there,

791
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:10,892
I adjust.

792
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:13,895
Guy tries to get away, I adjust.

793
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:17,565
Last Mark tries to break
me, I will not adjust!

794
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,354
You know...

795
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:45,059
Who had it all figured out?

796
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:46,894
Bruce Lee.

797
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:54,068
He said,

798
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,038
"you've got to be shapeless

799
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,006
like water.

800
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:05,380
When you put water into a cup...

801
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,551
It becomes the cup.

802
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:16,758
When you put it into a...

803
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,926
Into a teapot,

804
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:21,763
it becomes the teapot.

805
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,936
Water can flow.

806
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,039
And it can crash."

807
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,562
Become like water.

808
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,460
I don't see a case.

809
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:27,762
I don't have it.

810
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:30,698
This is done. We're
going to the sheriff.

811
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,700
- Why would we do that?
- Because you fucked up.

812
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:33,702
I...

813
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:37,004
The only way we're
gonna get out of this

814
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:38,573
is together.

815
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:40,208
Even if you run away
with that case,

816
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,577
how many doses do you have left?

817
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:45,213
You're gonna have
to come back here.

818
01:14:45,215 --> 01:14:46,747
And what?

819
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,082
Hmm?

820
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:50,084
Be like him?

821
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:03,598
What is this?

822
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,834
He had it in a file
with the others.

823
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:07,969
No.

824
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:14,008
He was always the only one
leaving this town alive.

825
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,676
But you already knew that.

826
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,889
I'm going to the home office.

827
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:29,524
I'm sorry.

828
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:34,295
Don't. Don't do that.

829
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:35,763
Where're you going?

830
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,901
I don't know.

831
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,143
Come on.

832
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:51,846
We'll go to the sheriff
me and you together.

833
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,548
We'll be protected.

834
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:55,917
How protected were
you last time?

835
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,787
This time we know what's coming.

836
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:04,559
Are you asking me to
turn on the company?

837
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:15,269
The company that wants you dead.

838
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,204
Yeah.

839
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,285
- Whoa!
- No. Wait.

840
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:34,121
- Let her go, son. -She's
coming along peacefully.

841
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:35,656
- Erin, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

842
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:37,992
Just wait a second.

843
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:39,327
All units,

844
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:40,861
Austin blum is at
the carroll office.

845
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:43,064
Erin... she can explain.

846
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,966
He is armed and
holding a hostage.

847
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:47,001
Willis, I'm turning myself in.

848
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,739
- What do you mean?
- Cale.

849
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:53,641
- What do you mean?
- Carroll killed those people.

850
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:55,910
Austin had nothing
to do with it.

851
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:57,345
I'll explain everything,
but right now

852
01:16:57,347 --> 01:16:58,879
we need to go.

853
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:01,182
Listen to her, sir.

854
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:03,117
Looks like I'm gonna owe rich...

855
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:04,979
Shh.

856
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,224
Shut the fuck up.

857
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:08,109
Shit, shit, shit.

858
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:10,010
What're we gonna do?

859
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,380
We need to find an exit.

860
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:15,516
The exits are on the south side.

861
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,431
Shh.

862
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,336
Shh.

863
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,400
No, no, no, no, no!

864
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:44,305
What?

865
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:45,573
What?

866
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,952
I did not do this.

867
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:00,888
Let me see your hands.

868
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,490
Slow, slow!

869
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:05,192
Both hands, blum.

870
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,061
Or else... shit!

871
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:23,010
We need an ambulance at
4239 deer spring road.

872
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:25,379
We got two vics, officer down.

873
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,520
Suspect Austin blum
is fleeing the scene.

874
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,631
Austin blum has killed
a lot of people

875
01:21:43,633 --> 01:21:46,000
over the past few days.

876
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,403
Including sheriff Willis.

877
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:57,044
He has been sighted with
two possible accomplices.

878
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:58,612
A man and a woman.

879
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,651
We got no reports
of stolen vehicles

880
01:22:03,653 --> 01:22:05,519
or missing persons,
so we can assume

881
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:06,987
he's on foot.

882
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,961
I want to thank you folks
for volunteering to help

883
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:16,630
Pete and myself.

884
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:20,267
Sweep the local ranches.

885
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,468
A lot of private property

886
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:24,071
out there for Austin to hide in.

887
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:34,148
This man has killed
friends and family.

888
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:36,617
Do not give him another chance!

889
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:42,489
Head on out to the trucks.

890
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,158
We roll out in five.

891
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,605
Hey, uh...

892
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:00,040
Sorry about the way

893
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:01,508
things ended with
you and Willis.

894
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,514
No matter what happened
these last couple days,

895
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:09,422
-you know he thought that you

896
01:23:09,434 --> 01:23:11,352
were a good guy... -hey.

897
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:13,287
I'll, uh...

898
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,091
Meet you at the o'Connor ranch.

899
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:18,459
Yeah.

900
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,331
See you there, sheriff.

901
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:07,274
I love the place.

902
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:09,543
What now?

903
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,379
That all depends how
many bullets you got.

904
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,755
So, what?

905
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,260
You're gonna kill me? Hmm?

906
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:28,562
Track down Mary, the cops,

907
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,330
kill them, too?

908
01:24:30,332 --> 01:24:32,633
- Mm-hmm.
- What happens next?

909
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:35,502
I don't know.

910
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:37,805
I never know until I get there.

911
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:42,676
Because every job is...

912
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,111
There's no pattern.

913
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,851
You believe in them?

914
01:24:50,853 --> 01:24:53,287
The company, what they do?

915
01:24:56,858 --> 01:25:01,295
- I'm just trying to survive.
- Me, too.

916
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:10,304
How long has it been? Hmm?

917
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:15,776
A couple of days.

918
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:18,612
Looks like you need a
little bit more juice.

919
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:23,717
You wanna dose?

920
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:25,152
Oh.

921
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:27,888
Go on.

922
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,392
Take it.

923
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,671
- I'm clean.
- Tsk. Awe.

924
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,843
There's no such thing
with this stuff.

925
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,349
Because if you're clean,

926
01:25:55,351 --> 01:25:56,583
you're dead.

927
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:12,666
Mary.

928
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,885
What happened?

929
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:33,720
What happened?

930
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:36,790
Nothing. Let's go.

931
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:37,925
Where're we gonna go?

932
01:26:37,927 --> 01:26:39,793
Doesn't matter.

933
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:42,429
Sheriff's dead. Erin's dead.

934
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:44,898
- What else do we have...
- Erin is not dead.

935
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:49,203
- What?
- She's not dead.

936
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:50,871
The ambulance are on
their way to get her

937
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:52,773
to take her to the
hospital, but,

938
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:54,474
they're an hour out.

939
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:56,743
It's not gonna be enough time.

940
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:59,446
Where's the case?

941
01:26:59,448 --> 01:27:00,948
What...

942
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:03,784
What're we gonna do?

943
01:27:03,786 --> 01:27:04,918
Save her life.

944
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:24,538
Hey, uh,

945
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,006
thanks for keeping an eye out.

946
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:27,507
Bro.

947
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,625
Dispatch.

948
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:21,595
We got an eta on that ambulance?

949
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,530
Sheriff Norton requesting eta

950
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:28,035
from ambulance
responding to code 3.

951
01:28:28,037 --> 01:28:29,803
Steve? You there?

952
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:48,021
Drop it.

953
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,396
Make sure it's locked.

954
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,536
Blum!

955
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,707
- Hold your fire!
- Toss your weapon!

956
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:08,842
God damn it, we are
not here to hurt you.

957
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,712
Toss your weapon now!
Show me your hands.

958
01:29:11,714 --> 01:29:14,681
We can save her.

959
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,083
- Give me one.
- All units.

960
01:29:16,085 --> 01:29:17,784
Austin blum is at Dr.
Hamlin's office.

961
01:29:17,786 --> 01:29:20,887
I repeat. Austin... slow!

962
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:22,856
- Slow!
- I'm gonna go in there.

963
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:25,125
No, you're not. Get
on your knees now.

964
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:27,127
She is willing to testify
against carroll,

965
01:29:27,129 --> 01:29:30,430
but she will not be saved
unless I walk in that door.

966
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:32,099
Blum, I will put a hole in you.

967
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:00,093
Shit.

968
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,797
You fucking people!

969
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:08,502
You couldn't make this easy!

970
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:15,842
I'm gonna burn this town
to the fucking ground.

971
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,047
Get out of here!

972
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,487
Help me!

973
01:30:39,735 --> 01:30:41,768
Don't miss...

974
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:57,884
Austin! Drop the weapon now!

975
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,168
Rich! Stop!

976
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:17,804
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

977
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,239
I'm gonna fix this.

978
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:20,607
Yeah.

979
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:30,717
Just drop the weapon!

980
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,887
Hands in the air now!

981
01:31:33,889 --> 01:31:35,188
Austin!

982
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:43,597
Let's see both your hands up!

983
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:45,699
Hands in the air now!

984
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:47,167
Now!

985
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,804
Drop it!

986
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:54,040
Drop it!

987
01:31:54,042 --> 01:31:55,042
Slow!

988
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:58,812
On your knees, hands in the air!

989
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:10,724
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

990
01:32:10,726 --> 01:32:13,026
