86
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,434
IT'S NO GOOD TO
GAMBLE ALL THE TIME.

87
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,100
IT MAKES BUMS.

88
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,534
MY COUSIN WORRY ME.

138
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,767

142
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,834
HIRE HIM
IF YOU WANT.

143
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:10,868
THE TRACTOR
DON'T KNOW

144
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,601

WELL, IF TRACTOR

151
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,033
NO PARTS TO FIX.

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,033
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

153
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,634

OH, THE THING'S
A BEAUTY.

160
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,267
HEY, YOU LIKE GUNS?

161
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,534
NICE TO BE
ON ONE END,

162
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,467
BAD TO BE ON
THE OTHER.

163
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,033
THAT WHAT THE DUCKS
ALL TELL ME.

164
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,067
THAT'S HIS SPECIALTY,
KILLING THINGS.

165
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,133
NOT ALWAYS WITH A GUN,
OF COURSE.

166
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:55,300
WHY DON'T YOU GO
MAKE A BED?

167
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:37,701
HI!

00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:46,534
OH, IF YOU THINK
THIS IS HOT,

172
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:48,167
YOU OUGHT TO BE OUT
HERE IN THE SUMMER.

173
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,934
YOU COULD FRY
IN YOUR OWN FAT.

174
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:55,834
NOT THAT THERE'S AN OUNCE
TOO MUCH OF THAT ON YOU.

175
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,667
OH. I'M HERE
ONLY A MONTH.

176
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,200
A WEEK GONE ALREADY.

00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,334
YOU'RE LUCKY.

178
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,834
YOU ONLY HAVE TO COUNT
THE DAYS ON THIS DUMP.

179
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,767
I HAVE TO COUNT
THE YEARS.

180
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,667
PLACE NOT SO BAD.

181
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,000
I HOPE TO HAVE ONE
AS GOOD SOME DAY.

182
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:13,801
AT 90 A MONTH, YOU
BETTER HOPE REAL HARD.

183
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,367
GOING INTO
TOWN TONIGHT?

184
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,767
SATURDAYS, EVERYBODY
HITS THE BREWERY-

185
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,701
EXCEPT THE AMES
FAMILY, OF COURSE.

186
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,200
MIGHT MAKE THE TRIP.

187
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,701
NOT MUCH MONEY
TO SPEND,

188
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,567
BUT IT COST
NOTHING TO LOOK.

189
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:27,901
STAY THERE!

190
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:30,133
LIE DOWN.
LIE DOWN THERE.

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,234
THAT'S IT.

192
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,033
THE LAST MAN
THAT WAS HERE,

193
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,000
THOSE DOGS ALMOST
CHEWED HIS ARM OFF.

194
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,334
HOW COME THEY
TAKE TO YOU?

195
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,334
GOOD REASON.

196
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,634
THEY KNOW I
TAKE TO THEM.

197
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,734
IF I HAD MY WAY,

198
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,367
I'D BLOW THEIR
HEADS OFF.

199
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:47,501
THEY'RE ALWAYS
AFTER NIKKI.

200
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,033
AREN'T THEY, BABY?

201
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,801
CAT LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO
DEFEND ITSELF IN A FIGHT.

202
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:53,868
WOULD PUT MONEY ON CAT.

203
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:56,501
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO BE, COMIC?

204
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,934
THAT'S WHAT AMES
WOULD LOVE-

205
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,400
TO SEE THOSE DOGS GET
A CHANCE AT THIS CAT!

206
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,300
AND I SUPPOSE
YOU WOULD, TOO.

207
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,868
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
GUYS LIKE BETTER

208
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,334
THAN TO SEE
SOMETHING GET HURT.

209
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,067
STILL PUT MONEY ON CAT.

210
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,767
AND IF NIKKI FEMALE CAT,

211
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,567
WILL GIVE ODDS.

212
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:15,634
SAY, CHU CHU...

213
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,701
I'M SORRY I MADE
THAT REMARK

214
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,567
ABOUT HIRING
FOREIGNERS.

215
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:22,234
WHAT I MEANT WAS,
UH...

216
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,100
I LIKE SOMETHING
HUMAN AROUND,

217
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,701
NOT A DIRTY RAGHEAD
OR A CHINK... OR-

218
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:27,834
OR A GREASER

219
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,100
LIKE CHU CHU RAMIREZ?

220
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,167
NO.

221
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:31,868
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

222
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,300
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

223
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,300
NO DIFFERENCE.

224
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,200
EXACTLY THE SAME.

225
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:38,801
EXACTLY.

226
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:41,701
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU HAVE IN COMMON

227
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,534
WITH ALL MEXICANS:

228
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,901
YOU SURE CAN
LOOK MEAN.

229
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:48,767
ONLY YOU DON'T
SCARE ME.

230
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,501
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

231
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,400
ANOTHER ONE, PLEASE.

232
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,834
I SAID,
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER.

233
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,901
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING
THAT ALL EVENING.

234
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:20,667
I'M ONLY TRYING TO
KEEP UP WITH THE SIGN.

235
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,767
YOU PASSED IT
LONG AGO.

236
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,501
$2.10.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,400
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
FOR A LITTLE VINO.

238
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:32,501
THAT'S A LOT OF VINO
FOR A LITTLE DAME.

239
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,968
WELL, I GUESS
I OWE YOU $2.00.

240
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,467
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE CUTE, AIN'T YOU?

241
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,300
LOOK, I CAME UP
FROM SACRAMENTO

242
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,901
TO GET A JOB,

243
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,000
AND I DIDN'T GET ONE.

244
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,334
HOW CUTE IS THAT?

245
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,534
DROWN YOUR SORROWS
ON SOMEBODY ELSE-

246
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:57,968
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
FOR INSTANCE.

247
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:58,968
NO, PLEASE!

248
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:00,367
NO, NO POLICE.

249
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,667
I PAY FOR THE WINE.

250
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,367
THANK YOU.

251
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,767

AND I THANK YOU.

253
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,767
WHATEVER YOU'RE
PRACTICING TO BE

254
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,267
THERE SHOULD
BE MORE OF.

255
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,634
FOR BEER.

256
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,334
ALSO 5 CENT TIP.

257
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,834
AND THE WINE, AMIGO?

258
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:56,000
IN REGARDS TO THE WINE...

259
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:11,934
YOU...

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,501
YOU GOT A FINE
LITTLE CAR.

261
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:15,934
IT'S MINE
TILL TOMORROW,

262
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,234
THEN THE FINANCE
COMPANY MOVES IN.

263
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,133
ENGINE IS NOW FLOOD.

264
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,267
TAKE SHOE OFF STARTER.

265
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,300
LOOK,

266
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,234
YOU BOUGHT $2.00 WORTH
OF NOTHING IN THERE.

267
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,767
EXACTLY NOTHING.

268
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:32,434
I WANT NOTHING
FROM YOU I CAN BUY.

269
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,767
WHERE'S THE HAT?

270
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,968
I PARTICULARLY
NOTICED THAT HAT.

271
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,901
HAT NOW ON BARTENDER.

272
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,334
SAME SIZE HEAD.

273
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:46,000
JUST EXACTLY WHAT
DO YOU EXPECT

274
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,734
FOR THAT GREAT
SACRIFICE?

275
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:50,367
TO TALK TO YOU FOR ONE
LITTLE MINUTE MAYBE.

276
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,801
STILL FLOOD.

277
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,868
PLENTY OF TIME TO
TELL YOUR NAME YET.

278
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,467
NANCY.

279
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:01,701

NOW WE KNOW EACH
OTHER WELL ENOUGH

283
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,634
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

284
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:08,601
GOOD-BYE.

285
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:12,367
BAD TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE
WHEN YOU HAVE TROUBLE.

286
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,033
TROUBLE?
DON'T BE FOOLISH.

287
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,067
I'M FORTUNE'S
DARLING.

288
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,834
CAR WILL START FOR ME,

289
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,834
BUT YOU HAVE NO MONEY.

290
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,467
SO, WHERE WILL
CAR TAKE YOU?

291
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,400
NO PLACE YOU'RE GOING.

292
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,968
I'M HEADING BACK TO
GOOD OLD SACRAMENTO.

293
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,868
IN SACRAMENTO, I COULD
GET YOU SOME MONEY.

294
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,767
HOW, BY HAWKING
YOUR COAT?

295
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,167

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,601
YOU MUST HAVE FRIENDS.

299

THE KIND OF
FRIENDS I HAVE,

300
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,701

307
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:56,234
STRANGE THING ABOUT YOU,

308
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,234
MEAN WORDS COME OUT
OF FACE NOT YET MEAN.

309
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,133

THAT'S EXACTLY
THE RIGHT WORD FOR ME.

313
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,267
NOTHING ELSE WOULD DO.

00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,033

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE,

322
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,234

00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,033
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF LETTER, MANUEL.

366
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,634
WE'LL COME BACK
AFTER TRACTOR JOB.

367
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:44,901
WELL,

368
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:46,200
TOOK NEARLY
A ROUND TRIP,

369
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,200
BUT HERE IT IS.

370
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,234
HERE IS WHAT?

371
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,934
THE DELAYED PASS.

372
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,667
IT'S FOOLISH
TO MAKE A PASS

373
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:54,367
UNLESS SOMEBODY
READY TO CATCH.

374
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,667
HERE IS WHERE I GO
BACK TO TRACTOR JOB.

375
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,734
I NOW SAY
GOOD NIGHT,

376
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,133
AND YOU GO HOME.

377
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:06,501
RAMIREZ?

378
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:11,868
YOU'RE MAKING
THIS 20

379
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,667
TOO HEAVY TO
CARRY AROUND.

380
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:15,667
I'VE BEEN WORKING.

381
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,167
I COULD HAVE PAID
FOR THE WINE MYSELF.

382
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,167
I STILL GOT A COUPLE
OF BUCKS LEFT.

383
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:21,901
NOW YOU GOT 22.

384
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,400
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A HAT.

385
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,400
OH, BARTENDER
PRETTY GOOD FELLOW.

386
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,434
NEXT WEEK, I POLISH
A FEW SPITTOONS,

387
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:29,767
GET HAT BACK AGAIN.

388
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,300
I JUST-I SEE YOU,

389
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,801
BUT I STILL DON'T
BELIEVE YOU.

390
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:35,167
THIS MONEY WASN'T
EASY TO COME BY,

391
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:36,400
WAS IT?

392
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:37,501
THAT LETTER
YOU LEFT,

393
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,334
YOU GAVE IT UP LIKE
IT WAS SOMETHING ALIVE.

394
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,334
WHAT WAS IN IT?

395
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,367
PERSONAL LETTER

396
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:42,968
FROM PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES

397
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:44,834
WHEN I AM MADE
CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY.

398
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:47,167
WELL, YOU SOUND LIKE
SOMEBODY DID YOU A BIG FAVOR.

399
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:48,767
DO YOU NOT KNOW
HOW BIG, NANCY?

400
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,534
YOU'VE BEEN CITIZEN
ALL YOUR LIFE.

401
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,267
SURE, SOMETHING
I WAS BORN WITH,

402
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:53,701
LIKE THE COLOR
OF MY EYES.

403
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:54,868
BUT IT DOESN'T
DO A THING FOR ME.

404
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:55,901
NOT A THING.

405
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:58,434
MAYBE PEOPLE SHOULD
NOT BE BORN CITIZENS.

406
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,767
TOO EASY.

407
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:00,901
SHOULD WORK FOR IT.

408
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:02,367
STUDY TO GET PAPERS.

409
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:04,267
THEN THEY KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS.

410
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:05,334
OH, I SUPPOSE
YOU KNOW.

411
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,334
I KNOW THIS...

412
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,467
I BELONG HERE
MUCH AS ANYBODY,

413
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:09,601
BIG AS ANYBODY.

414
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,934
SAME LAWS FOR
ALL OF THEM.

415
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,100
VOTE SAME AS
MR. ABRAHAM LINCOLN

416
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,701
OR MR. GEORGE WASHINGTON.

417
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,367
ONE MAN, ONE VOTE.

418
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:20,467
LINCOLN, WASHINGTON,
RAMIREZ.

419
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,367
IS THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT
WROTE YOU IN HIS LETTER?

420
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,167
LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT HE SAY?

421
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,300
IF SO, I HAVE IT
WRITTEN HERE.

422
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:29,200
GO AHEAD,
MAKE ME CRY.

423
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:30,801
IT'S FROM WHITE HOUSE.

424
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,067
IT'S ADDRESSED TO ME.

425
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:34,467
"DEAR MR. RAMIREZ,

426
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:37,300

441
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:07,033
AND AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE PAGE IS

442
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,968
THE PRESIDENT'S NAME-
IN PEN AND INK.

443
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,701
LOOK!
I'M NOT CRYING.

444
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,267
I'M LAUGHING.

445
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:15,767
RAMIREZ, TODAY
YOU DRIVE A TRACTOR.

446
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,367
TOMORROW YOU'LL
SWEAT YOUR EARS OFF

447
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,033
IN SOME STINKING
FISH CANNERY,

448
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,701
NEXT WEEK YOU'LL BE
BREAKING YOUR BACK

449
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,267
IN ASPARAGUS,
SPINACH, AND GRAPES.

450
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:24,234
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE
A CITIZEN FIRST CLASS?

451
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,567
CITIZEN OF WHAT?!

452
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:26,734
WHAT YOU ARE
IS A SAP,

453
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,133
AND ALL YOU'VE GOT IS
THE PAPERS TO PROVE IT.

454
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,601
A SAP? WHY?
BECAUSE I WORK?

455
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,567
WHAT'S WRONG WITH WORK?

456
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,167
NOBODY ANY GOOD
WITHOUT WORK.

457
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:34,334
WHEN I WORK TO TAKE
FOOD FROM GROUND,

458
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,701
I'M DOING PART
IN STRUGGLE.

459
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,100
STRUGGLE?
WHAT STRUGGLE?!

460
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,334
THE STRUGGLE OF
PEOPLE ALL OVER

461
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,934
TO LIVE BETTER,
BE HAPPIER,

462
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,767
HAVE GOOD THINGS.

463
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,200
MAYBE YOUR STRUGGLE,
TOO, NANCY.

464
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,200
THE REASON YOU
DRINK MUSCATEL.

465
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:48,968
GET OUT OF HERE!

466
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,834
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I CAN'T STAND YOU.

467
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,701
AND REMEMBER-

468
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:53,968
IT'S WORTH EVERY
CENT OF THE 20 BUCKS

469
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:55,167
I BEAT YOU OUT OF-

470
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:56,167
YOU'RE A FOOL!

471
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:57,300
THEY WON'T ONLY
HURT YOU,

472
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:58,901
THEY'LL ROLL OVER
AND CRUSH YOU-

473
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,300
THEIR BIG BLACK HAT
AND ALL.

474
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,534
GOOD-BYE, NANCY.

475
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,467
YOU'RE ONE PEACH
OF A FINE GIRL.

476
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,234
BIG BLACK HAT AND ALL!

477
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,234
LOOK. LOOK!

478
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!

479
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:41,601
SHAME!

480
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,400
SHOULD HANG YOUR HEAD
AND PRAY FORGIVENESS.

481
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:47,000
IT'S GREAT TEMPTATION THAT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESISTED.

482
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,934
BAD DOG! YOU STAY THERE.

483
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,100
STAY THERE!

484
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,067
I REGRET.

485
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:03,033
FINE THING WHEN ALL
YOU HAVE TO BAWL ABOUT

486
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,400
IS A DEAD CAT.

487
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:07,801
THOSE ROTTEN DOGS!

488
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,834
IF I HAD ONE
OF AMES' GUNS,

489
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,467
I WOULD HAVE SHOT THEM!

490
00:26:13,534 --> 00:26:15,467
OH, THE DOGS ARE
NOT TO BLAME.

491
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,133
LONG TIME YOU
BUILD UP HATE

492
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,834
BETWEEN
DOGS AND CATS.

493
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:20,567
HOLD CAT
IN YOUR ARMS,

494
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,834
MAKE DOGS THINK IT'S
SOMETHING GOOD TO CATCH.

495
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:24,267
YOU KNOW?

496
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,734
BOUND TO MAKE
TROUBLE.

497
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,300
YOU KNOW,
MY PEOPLE SAY,

498
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,801
"BEST WAY TO
CURE SADNESS

499
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:33,801
IS BE HAPPY."

500
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,467
LIVE CAT MAKE CRYING
STOP WITH THE DEAD CAT.

501
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:38,767
MAYBE I FIND
YOU ONE, HUH?

502
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:41,167
SMALL KITTEN?

503
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:43,167
YOU TEACH HIM
NOT TO BE AFRAID

504
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,501
AND DOGS NOT BOTHER.

505
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,067
LEAVE CAT ON GROUND.

506
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,000
THEY BELONG
ON GROUND.

507
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,033
I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER CAT AGAIN

508
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,634
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

509
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:56,167
THANKS ALL THE SAME.

510
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:06,200
THOROUGHBRED
SACRAMENTO CAT.

511
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:07,734
THINK IT OVER, EH?

512
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:22,434
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THAT
RAMIREZ GUY FOR 3 WEEKS.

513
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,734
I THINK I'VE FINALLY
GOT HIM PEGGED.

514
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:27,567
FOR YOU,
THAT'S REAL FAST.

515
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:28,667
YOU KNOW,
HE'S THE KIND

516
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,467
THAT AIN'T NEVER
GONNA GET NO PLACE.

517
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:33,067
YOU KNOW WHY?

518
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:34,400
HE LIKES WHAT'S
ALONG THE WAY

519
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:36,434
BETTER THAN HE LIKES
WHERE HE'S GOING.

520
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,367
LOOK AT HIM OUT THERE.

521
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:47,400
WHAT'S HE DO-

522
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:48,400
YOU DIDN'T
TELL HIM TO

523
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,868
DIG UP THAT CAT,
DID YOU?!

524
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,801
OH, KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON.

525
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:53,100
COME TO ME THIS MORNING,

526
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,167
HE SAID HOW WOULD IT BE

527
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:57,400
IF HE PLANTED SOME FLOWERS
OVER THAT CAT?

528
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,801
FLOWERS ON A CAT'S GRAVE!

529
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:03,234
HOW'S A GUY LIKE THAT
EVER GONNA GET ANYPLACE?

530
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:09,934
HOW COME YOU GAVE HIM TIME
OFF FROM DIGGING STUMPS?

531
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,767
SHOWS YOU HOW DUMB HE IS.

532
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,534
HE SAID HE
COULD DO IT

533
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,501
IF HE DID IT ON
HIS LUNCH HOUR.

534
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:18,534
A BORN DIGGER OF STUMPS.

535
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:27,467
WHEN'S HE GONNA BE
THROUGH WITH THIS JOB?

536
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:29,868
MR. RAMIREZ WILL
BE LEAVING US

537
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:31,400
IN A COUPLE-3 DAYS,

538
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:33,968
THAT IS, IF YOU CAN
STAY AWAY FROM HIM

539
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,734
WITH MY BEER!

540
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:36,801
DON'T WORRY.

541
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:38,200
HE CAN'T GET OUT
OF HERE SOON ENOUGH

542
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:39,734
TO SUIT ME.

543
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:03,000
OH, I KIND OF HATE
TO LOSE HIM, THOUGH.

544
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:06,167
HE'S DONE A PRETTY GOOD
JOB FOR A MEXICAN.

545
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:11,200
THAT IS, AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED.

546
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,467
HE'S DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

547
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,400
ARE YOU JUST
MAKING NOISE,

548
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,067
OR YOU TALKING
FOR MY BENEFIT?

549
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,300
I'M TALKING WHAT'S
IN YOUR HEAD.

550
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,167
I AIN'T BLIND.

551
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,934
WISH I KNEW WHAT
WAS KEEPING ME HERE.

552
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,100
MAYBE THE SAME REASON
I DON'T THROW YOU OUT...

553
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,667
WHATEVER THAT IS.

554
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,200
HI.

555
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,000
I BROUGHT YOU
A BETTER LAMP

556
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,934
IF YOU'RE GONNA READ
YOUR EYES OUT ALL NIGHT.

557
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THAT'S A NICE LAMP.
THANK YOU.

558
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,801
WHAT'S SO WONDERFUL
IN THIS?

559
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:16,100
EVERYTHING
EVERYBODY KNOWS-

560
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:17,167
IN THERE.

561
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,067
DID YOU COME
ACROSS A PART

562
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:22,701
THAT EXPLAINS A GUY
LIKE AMES, FOR INSTANCE?

563
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:23,767
LOTS OF VOLUMES
TO READ YET.

564
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:27,234
OR A GUY LIKE YOU?

565
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,267
LET ME KNOW IF YOU COME
TO A PART ABOUT YOU.

566
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:35,767
OH, THAT'S THE ONE THING
THE BOOKS LEAVE OUT.

567
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,000
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WRITING
BOOKS ABOUT PEOPLE.

568
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,434
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

569
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:42,100
NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYBODY.

570
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:45,667
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

571
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:47,267
IT'S BIG TROUBLE
WITH MOST PEOPLE.

572
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,033
THEY STUDY
THEMSELVES LIKE

573
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,067
IT WAS THE ONLY
SUBJECT.

574
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,100
WHAT OTHER SUBJECT
IS THERE?

575
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,634
IT'S A BIG WORLD.

576
00:30:56,701 --> 00:31:00,067
THE WORLD NEVER
INTERESTED ME MUCH.

577
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,000
JUST THE LITTLE HUNK
I'M STANDING ON.

578
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:08,234
YOU'RE STANDING
ON IT WITH ME.

579
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,934
IT USED TO BE AMES.

580
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,467
WHY HE NOT
STAND THERE NOW?

581
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:18,167
HE SAYS
I PUSHED HIM OFF.

582
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:19,634
I THINK HE JUMPED.

583
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,534
NO... NO, PLEASE.

584
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:32,467
PLEASE.

585
00:31:32,534 --> 00:31:34,234
PLEASE LET ME...

586
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:41,901
YOU'RE A VERY PRETTY
WOMAN, MRS. AMES.

587
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:44,534
TOO PRETTY TO HIDE
IN THE DARK.

588
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:48,534
SO WHEN YOU BLOW OUT LIGHT,
IT WAS TO HIDE ME, NO?

589
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,167
I NOT LIKE TO HIDE,

590
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:53,300
WITH ANYONE
OR FROM ANYONE.

591
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:55,968
OH, GO BACK TO
YOUR BOOKS.

592
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,534
DON'T TRY TO FIND OUT
WHAT I'M THINKING.

593
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:04,033
IT'S CLEAR WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

594
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:10,000
I AM SORRY, BUT WE
CAN'T HONOR THAT CHECK.

595
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,701
IS NOT THE NATIONAL
BANK OF SACRAMENTO?

596
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:12,701
IT IS.

597
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,601
CAPITAL ASSETS
$4 MILLION?

598
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,467
THAT'S RIGHT, BUT
VERY LITTLE OF IT

599
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,934
BELONGS TO MR. AMES,

600
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,601
AT LEAST NOT ENOUGH
TO COVER YOUR CHECK.

601
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,534
YOU BERER SEE
MR. AMES.

602
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:24,601
YEAH.

603
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,334
HA HA.
HEY, FELLA, HI.

604
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,334
HOW ARE YOU...?

605
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:46,234
DON'T LET THOSE DOGS
FOOL YOU.

606
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,834
YOU'RE NOT
WELCOME HERE.

607
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,667
NO GOOD,
THIS CHECK OF MR. AMES.

608
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:53,667
HEY, AMES.

609
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:54,934
WHAT?

610
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,601
COME ON IN HERE.
THE SUMP DIGGER IS BACK.

611
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:01,634
MAN IN BANK SAYS
THIS CHECK WILL STRETCH

612
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,200
FROM HERE TO SACRAMENTO.

613
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:05,434
WELL, HE'S CRAZY.

614
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,033
THERE MUST BE
SOME MISTAKE.

615
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,234
I SENT HIM
THE DEPOSIT

616
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,767
A COUPLE OF DAYS
AGO.

617
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:14,567
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT
DIDN'T GET THERE.

618
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,033
MAYBE.

619
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,801
I NOT LIKE CHECK
WITH TWO-WAY STRETCH.

620
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,367
COME ON...

621
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:27,767
BETTER THINK UP SOMETHING

622
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,234
FOR WHEN
HE COMES BACK.

623
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,767
DON'T WORRY.

624
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,667
I'LL KEEP THAT GUY
RUNNING BACK AND FORTH

625
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:35,367
TILL HE FORGETS WHAT
HE'S RUNNING FOR.

626
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:40,367
IT MAY TAKE HIM 3 OR
4 TRIPS, OF COURSE,

627
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:42,434
SO YOU CAN KEEP
YOURSELF DOLLED UP.

628
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,367
I DON'T KNOW
WHO I DESPISE MOST:

629
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:50,734
A BORN SUMP DIGGER
OR A BORN CHISELER.

630
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:52,801
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES
A CHISELER?

631
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:54,033
HAVING TO CHISEL.

632
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,567
SURE, AND HAVING
A TALENT FOR IT.

633
00:34:11,734 --> 00:34:14,267
BIG PROBLEM NOW IS, WHO'S
GOING TO KILL THE BIRD?

634
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:17,367
PROBLEM IS NOT MINE.
I PROVIDE THE BIRD.

635
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:19,334
MY GIRL WILL
COOK HIM.

636
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,634
BUT HE MUST BE DEAD,
HOWEVER, AND WITHOUT FEATHERS.

637
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:24,567
WELL, HOW ABOUT
WILLIE CHUNG?

638
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:26,501
HE'S A MAN
WITHOUT PITY.

639
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,868
WE WILL CUT [INDISTINCT]
ON A [INDISTINCT] BIRD.

640
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,734
WITH YOUR CARDS,
IS NO CONTEST.

641
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:32,734
GET DOWN, MUCHACHOS.

642
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:40,868
OH. ONE SON OF A GUN
OF A BIRD.

643
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,167
HE PLAY POKER?

644
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:43,667
NOBODY PLAY POKER.

645
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,467
WILLIE CHUNG
WIN ALL THE MONEY.

646
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:48,267
FORTUNATELY, CELESTINO
PRODUCED THE BIRD.

647
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,968
WE COULD EAT
IF SOMEBODY HAD

648
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:52,434
THE SIMPLE COURAGE
OF KILLING.

649
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:56,501
WELL, WE BETTER COOK
CELESTINO. HE'S YOUNGER.

650
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:59,267
THIS FELLOW OLD ENOUGH
TO RETIRE.

651
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:00,767
NO NEED TO FEAR.

652
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,367
FOOD IS ON ME.

653
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,267
I HAVE MONEY.

654
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:06,734
IT'S NOT MONEY
YET. IT'S ONLY A CHECK.

655
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:09,100
IT WILL BE WHEN YOU
CASH IT, WILLIE CHUNG.

656
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,501
NAME A MAKER,
PLEASE.

657
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:14,267
A BIG FARMER BY THE
NAME OF AMES, FOR WAGES.

658
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:15,934
PRODUCE
ENDORSEMENT.

659
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:27,767
HE'S STRONG.

660
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,501
$90 CASH.

661
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,701
PRESIDENT'S LETTER,
$20.

662
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:37,434
LOSE IN POKER GAME
TO WILLIE CHUNG.

663
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,534
A MAN WHO WILL BET
PRESIDENT'S LETTER

664
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,434
WILL BET
HIS OWN MOTHER.

665
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,701
PRODUCE LETTER.

666
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,601
$20, PLEASE.

667
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,767
$8.00, CHU CHU.

668
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:52,567
FOR WHAT? FOR LOSE
LETTER TO WILLIE CHUNG?

669
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:56,033
NO! FOR ROOM RENT,
FOR THE BOOKS!

670
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,434
IT'S TOO MUCH.

671
00:35:57,501 --> 00:35:59,367
IT'S WHAT MAKES
INFLATION.

672
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:01,033
STOMACH IS
NOT INFLATED.

673
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,300
WILL BE SOON.

674
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,734
I NOW GO OUT
AND BUY EVERYTHING.

675
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:07,334
CIGARS, WINE, FOOD,
EVERYTHING.

676
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,901
WE HAVE BIG PARTY
TO HONOR

677
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:10,567
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, ALL RIGHT?

678
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:40,067
I, UM,
I SEE FINANCE COMPANY

679
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:41,868
DID NOT CAPTURE CAR.

680
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,334
I SEE BARTENDER
DID NOT KEEP HAT.

681
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:51,267
NANCY, THIS VERY BAD
FOR YOU.

682
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,400
PLEASE TAKE
ADVICE, HUH?

683
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:54,501
YOU'RE
THE LITTLE BROTHER

684
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,801
TO ALL THE WORLD,
AREN'T YOU?

685
00:36:56,868 --> 00:36:59,801
IF I AM YOUR BROTHER,
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

686
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:01,701
I FEEL LIKE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

687
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:04,133
LOOK, MR. SAP.

688
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
WILL YOU STAY AWAY
FROM ME?

689
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,767
I'M POISON TO SAP.

690
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,067
BUT IF I WAS
YOUR BROTHER,

691
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:10,601
I WOULD NOT
USE ADVICE.

692
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,000
I WOULD USE THIS.

693
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,133
NOT TOO HARD.

694
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,434
MEAN WORDS
DON'T FOOL ME.

695
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,567
YOU'RE JUST A CRAZY
KID, NANCY.

696
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:22,067
HMM.

697
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:29,901
I CAN'T STAND
THIS CAR,

698
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:31,734
I CAN'T STAND
ADVICE,

699
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:34,000
AND I CAN'T STAND
YOU.

700
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:44,968
OH... I CAN'T STAND MYSELF.

701
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,334
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT,

702
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,634
FRIEND RAMIREZ.

703
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,100
IT SAYS IN
THE BIBLE,

704
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,434
"PLAIN IS PLAIN."

705
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:11,267
A LITTLE WINE FOR THE STOMACH TO SETTLE.

706
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:13,300
DO YOU GO BY
THE BIBLE?

707
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:17,734
WHEN IT'S ON MY SIDE, I SWEAR BY IT.

708
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:20,734
SELL YOU
A LITTLE WINE.

709
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,167
A LITTLE AT A TIME.

710
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,100
CAN I HELP IT IF A LOT
OF LITTLE MAKES A LOT?

711
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,868
TO YOU, LIEUTENANT
WEBSON, WHEREVER YOU ARE.

712
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:39,100
GLASS IS EMPTY.

713
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:42,400
THAT'S A PERFECT WAY
TO DRINK TO A GHOST.

714
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,534
OH, EXCUSE ME.

715
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,968
LIEUTENANT WEBSON,
CHU CHU RAMIREZ.

716
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:50,601
PLEASED TO MEET YU,
LEUTENAN@

717
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,467
I EXPECT TO HEAR
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

718
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,634
LIEUTENANT, WOULD YOU
MIND IF I TOLD CHU CHU

719
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:02,601
THE STORY OF
OUR LIVES?

720
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,200
THANK YOU.

721
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:05,567
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T.

722
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:11,033
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY,
YOU BEING A CROP PICKER.

723
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,133
YOU PROBABLY WORKED
A LOT FOR MY FATHER.

724
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,534
HE OWNED
HALF THE GRAPES

725
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:18,834
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN
VALLEY.

726
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,300
WHAT NAME DID HE
GO BY?

727
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:25,501
LIEUTENANT,
WHAT WAS THE NAME

728
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:28,100
HE CHANGED IT TO...
MRS. WEBSON?

729
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,868
I'LL SAY CONGRATULATIONS,
LIEUTENANT.

730
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,367
I- I HAD EVERYTHING.

731
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:40,534
CLOTHES, CARS,
SCHOOLS.

732
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:45,000
EVERYTHING I WANTED,
MY FATHER GOT FOR ME.

733
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,234
ALL EXCEPT THE GUYS.

734
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,868
I GOT THEM MYSELF.

735
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,267
AND I REALLY
HATE IT WHEN...

736
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,400
EVERYTHING'S EXACTLY
2 WEEKS.

737
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:01,601
BUT I FIGURE
I SHOULDN'T CARE,

738
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,801
'CAUSE MOST PEOPLE
NEVER HAVE NOTHING.

739
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,400
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULD KISS AND TELL.

740
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:13,234
ALL YOU GOT WAS A FINE MILITARY FUNERAL.

741
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:17,167
HE WAS
A FIGHTER PILOT.

742
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,434
AND THEN-HE DID
SOME KIND OF TEST

743
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,534
IN THE
MOJAVE DESERT.

744
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:29,334
SOMETHING
WENT WRONG.

745
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,534
SOME LITTLE THING
WENT WRONG.

746
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:35,968
THAT'S WHAT
THEY SAID TO ME.

747
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,801
SOME LITTLE THING
WENT WRONG.

748
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:43,601
THEN 3 YEARS AGO,
EVERYTHING GOT DARK FOR ME.

749
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,734
CHU CHU.

750
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:50,167
ALL THE SUNLIGHT
DISAPPEARED.

751
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,567
ALL EXCEPT THIS
BOTTLE OF SUNLIGHT.

752
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,601
THE LIEUTENANT
WANTS TO KNOW

753
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,067
WHAT YOU THINK OF
MY STORY.

754
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:13,400
IT SADDENED ME.

755
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,167
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

756
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,167
EVERY OTHER WORD
OF IT, NANCY.

757
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:36,634
I THINK THAT ONE
DOES IT.

758
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:45,167
I TAKE YOU HOME
NOW, NANCY, HMM?

759
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,901
TpEREYOLI?

760
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:54,734
FRANKIE.

761
00:41:58,734 --> 00:41:59,901
CHECK?
YEAH.

762
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:01,200
WHERE THIS GIRL LIVE?

763
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:02,300
YEAH.

764
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:11,334
OH, GO AHEAD. I GOT NO SECRETS,

765
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,000
EXCEPT
IN MYSELF.

766
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,267
UH-HUH.

767
00:42:19,334 --> 00:42:20,934
STOP AND SLEEP MOTEL.

768
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,300
A CHOICE DUMP.

769
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:24,100
OUT ON THE ROAD
TO STOCKTON.

770
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,734
ONLY I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY USED KEYS.

771
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:31,267
WHAT I HEAR IS THE
DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPEN,

772
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:35,067
AND EVERYBODY'S NAME IS
JOHNSON ON THE REGISTER.

773
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,434
IT'S A HOME AWAY
FROM HOME, BOY,

774
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:38,834
ONLY BETTER.

775
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:44,801
YOU WILL SAY TO MRS. WEBSON YOU REGRET.

776
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:50,200
FRANKIE REGRETS.

777
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,300
WHAT'S ONE MORE REGRET?

778
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:07,801
WE'LL LEAVE NOW,
NANCY, HMM?

779
00:43:21,701 --> 00:43:23,567
GOOD NIGHT,
LIEUTENANT.

780
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,434
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THE MINUTE I SAW IT.

781
00:44:41,501 --> 00:44:43,968
THAT'S A HAT
YOU CAN TRUST.

782
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:46,400
SAME THING I KNOW
WHEN I SEE YOU.

783
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:50,400
DON'T YOU EVER
BELIEVEIT.

784
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:55,267
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
ON A WINO.

785
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:57,767
RACK ME UP,
AS THE GAMBLERS SAY.

786
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:02,534
CHU CHU...

787
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:06,000
LAST NIGHT
YOU SAID YOU BELIEVED

788
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:08,734
EVERY OTHER WORD I-
I TOLD YOU.

789
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:11,400
THAT WAS WAY TOO MUCH.

790
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:13,601
ABOUT EVERY TENTH WORD
WOULD'VE BEEN MORE LIKE IT.

791
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:18,834
MY FATHER WAS
A DRUNKEN BUM

792
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:22,400
WITH 10 ACRES
AND A STATEWIDE THIRST.

793
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:23,601
BY THE TIME I WAS 12,

794
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,300
ALL HE HAD LEFT
WAS THE THIRST.

795
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:28,367
THAT'S WHAT HE LEFT ME
IN HIS WILL- A THIRST.

796
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,634
THERE'S NO NEED
TO TELL THIS.

797
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:31,200
THERE WERE NO CARS,
THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS,

798
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:32,534
THERE WAS NOTHING.

799
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:34,300
PLENTY OF WORK.

800
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:36,501
I WANTED TO GET AWAY
FROM IT.

801
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,000
THAT'S WHAT I DID
WHEN I MET HERB WEBSON.

802
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:41,601
HE WASN'T A BAD GUY.
HE WASN'T A GOOD GUY.

803
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:43,400
HE WAS JUST A GUY.

804
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:46,234
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD'VE
HAPPENED IF HE HAD LIVED.

805
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,267
BUT HE DIDN'T.

806
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:51,801
I GUESS I GOT WHAT I
WANTED WHEN I MARRIED HIM.

807
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:54,701
$10,000.
INSURANCE.

808
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,667
IT SHOULD'VE GONE TO HIS MOTHER
AND FATHER, BUT IT DIDN'T.

809
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:58,968
IT WENT TO ME.

810
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,734
I KNEW THEY NEEDED IT.

811
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:04,133
WHILE I WAS MAKING UP MY MIND
TO BE GENEROUS, I SPENT IT.

812
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,634
I FINALLY GOT AROUND
TO SEE THEM.

813
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:07,501
I HAD $1,000 LEFT.

814
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,367
YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT,
CHU CHU.

815
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:13,267
EVERY LAST WORD OF IT.

816
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:18,467
I REMEMBER.

817
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:20,667
AND NOW WE FORGET.

818
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:22,200
EVERY LAST WORD OF IT.

819
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,767
YOU DON'T BELONG
IN THIS CENTURY.

820
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,000
EXCUSE THE EXPRESSION,

821
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:34,367
BUT WHY DON'T YOU GO
BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM?

822
00:46:34,434 --> 00:46:35,701
MEXICO?

823
00:46:37,534 --> 00:46:39,634
NOTHING THERE FOR ME
ANYMORE.

824
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,868
FATHER DIE.
MOTHER DIE.

825
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:46,400
ONLY SAD MEMORIES.

826
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:52,434
NO, THIS IS
MY COUNTRY NOW.

827
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:55,601
AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL.

828
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:58,000
WANT TO SHOW ME IT
SOMETIME.

829
00:46:58,067 --> 00:46:59,667
I NEVER BEEN THERE.

830
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,334
WE COULD SEE IT
TOGETHER, NANCY.

831
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:15,968
IF YOU WILL BE MY GIRL.

832
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:24,300
CHU CHU.

833
00:47:27,534 --> 00:47:29,200
THE HAT, CHU CHU.

834
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:33,667
DON'T STEP ON THAT HAT. OH.

835
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:58,701
AHH.

836
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:02,167
YOU'RE
A REASONABLE FELLOW.

837
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:03,834
DON'T ASK MUCH.

838
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:06,167
ONLY NOT TO HAVE
AX ON NECK.

839
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:08,968
HAVE A LITTLE
PAIN SOMEWHERE.

840
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:10,868
COUPLE OF HANDS,
MAYBE, HUH?

841
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,167
HA HA HA.

842
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:18,200
HA! UP!

843
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:20,701
IT'S FOR READ,
NOT TO SIT.

844
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:24,234
FINE CELEBRATION.

845
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:28,000
FINE

846
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:29,467
A TRAITOR.

847
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:36,000
IS SOGGY.

848
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:38,567
EAT, DRINK,
BE HAPPY.

849
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:40,534
DRINK TO
PRESIDENT?

850
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:48,734
CHU CHU HASN'T
BEEN WITH PRESIDENT,

851
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,767
UNLESS NOW PRESIDENT
USES PERFUME.

852
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:02,567
ALSO LIPSTICK.

853
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:04,801
DRINK.
ASK NO QUESTIONS.

854
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:06,300
LIPSTICK OR PERFUME.

855
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:07,934
DRINK TO
PRESIDENT RAMIREZ.

856
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:10,934
WHY, YA THIEF!

857
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,968
CAREFUL OF NAMES,
WILLIE CHUNG.

858
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:16,434
THIS CHECK IS
NO GOOD.

859
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:18,067
THE BANK.
IT BOUNCE.

860
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:19,968
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
DEPOSIT MADE.

861
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:21,234
I COME FROM BANK.

862
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,734
AMES DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO COVER DATE ON CHECK.

863
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:25,634
AMES LIE.
YOU LIE.

864
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,434
HERE IS ALL THE...

865
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:34,100
I DO NOT CHEAT YOU,
WILLIE CHUNG.

866
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,067
AMES CHEAT YOU,
YOU CHEAT WILLIE,

867
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:38,033
EVERYBODY CHEAT EVERYBODY.

868
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,834
LIKE YOU SAY,
IS WONDERFUL SYSTEM.

869
00:49:41,901 --> 00:49:44,067
ONLY $50 LEFT ON 90,

870
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:45,434
AND STILL OWE ME 40.

871
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:46,501
LETTER FROM
PRESIDENT.

872
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,767
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT
LIKE STOCK.

873
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:52,100
BUY FOR 20, SELL FOR 40.

874
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:53,701
WONDERFUL SYSTEM.

875
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:06,200
REMEMBER THIS.

876
00:50:06,267 --> 00:50:08,067
LETTER IS NEVER SOLD.

877
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:09,667
IS ONLY SECURITY.

878
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:10,968
TEMPORARY.

879
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:19,300
WONDERFUL SYSTEM.

880
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,400
VERY GOOD BOY, HUH?

881
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:32,501
CHECK STILL BOUNCING,
MR. AMES.

882
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:34,000
TWICE I GO TO BANK.

883
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,033
ONCE MY FRIEND
WILLIE CHUNG GO.

884
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,534
ALL TIMES,
CHECK NO GOOD.

885
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,501
OH, NOW THAT OUGHT
TO PROVE SOMETHING,

886
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:40,534
EVEN TO YOU.

887
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,667
PROVE NOTHING,
EXCEPT CHECK STILL

888
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:44,667
EXCELLENT
GRADE 6 PLY RUBBER.

889
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:48,067
I GOT NO MONEY, BOY.
UNDERSTAND?

890
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,734
UNDERSTAND ONLY
I WORK HARD.

891
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:52,767
30 DAYS. IS RIGHT I
GET PAID. IS THE LAW.

892
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,033
THERE'S ALSO A LAW ABOUT

893
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,067
TRESPASSING ON
ANOTHER MAN'S PROPERTY.

894
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,634
TWO LAWS TO BE
OBEYED, THEN.

895
00:50:57,701 --> 00:51:00,000
YOU PAY, I GO.
NOT UNTIL.

896
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:02,567
I DO NOT WISH
ANY TROUBLE, MR. AMES,

897
00:51:02,634 --> 00:51:04,200
BUT IF YOU INSIST,
I WILL OBL-

898
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:09,334
YOU'RE GETTING OFF
THIS PLACE.

899
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,701
ONE BIG PIECE
OR A LOT OF LITTLE ONES.

900
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,767
TAKE YOUR PICK.

901
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:18,167
WHAT A MAN EARNS,

902
00:51:18,234 --> 00:51:20,934
YOU CANNOT TAKE AWAY
WITH A GUN.

903
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,267
EXCEPT FOR
A LITTLE WHILE, MAYBE.

904
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:26,133
YOU'LL HEAR FROM
ME AGAIN, AND SOON.

905
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:31,567
WELL.

906
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:34,968
NO MEX IS
PUSHING ME AROUND.

907
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:39,868
OH, FOOL, THAT SHOTGUN
MAKES YOU REAL HARD TO PUSH.

908
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:41,901
YOU DON'T NEED
NO GUN WITH HIM.

909
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,968
THEN WHY ARE YOU STILL
POINTING IT AT HIM?

910
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,801
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M POINTING
IT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

911
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:50,534
COULD BE.

912
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:53,801
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
STICKING IT IN YOUR MOUTH?

913
00:51:53,868 --> 00:51:56,901
YOU MISERABLE...

914
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,100
IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT
THE DEFENDANT, ANSEL AMES,

915
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:06,033
OWES THE COMPLAINANT
CHU CHU RAMIREZ

916
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,033
THE SUM OF $90.

917
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,467
DEFENDANT HAS
GIVEN PROOF

918
00:52:09,534 --> 00:52:11,467
THAT THE RANCH AT WHICH
THE LABOR WAS PERFORMED

919
00:52:11,534 --> 00:52:14,033
BELONGS TO HIS
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

920
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,801
THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF
IS WITHOUT FUNDS,

921
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:17,133
BUT IS WILLING TO GUARANTEE

922
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,033
FULL DISCHARGE OF THE DEBT
WITHIN 60 DAYS.

923
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,834
THAT'S RIGHT.

924
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:24,601
I DON'T WANT TO CHEAT
NO MAN, BELIEVE ME.

925
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,634
WILL 60 DAYS BE
SATISFACTORY, MR. RAMIREZ?

926
00:52:29,701 --> 00:52:31,834
OH, IT'S FINE.
I NOT WORRY.

927
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:33,133
I GOT MONEY.
I KNOW THIS.

928
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,968
IS LAW OF THE LAND.

929
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:36,534
MR. AMES NO CROOK.

930
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:39,868
JUST LOOK LIKE CROOK.

931
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:49,734
YOU DAMES SURE
PUT ON A BIG ACT

932
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:51,701
WITH THAT COLD TEA.

933
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:54,100
OH, LISTEN, SIR. I COULDN'T
STAND YOU ON COLD TEA.

934
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,734
THAT'S THE REAL THING.

935
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:57,834
WELL, HELLO.

936
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:59,968
GOOD-BYE.

937
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:01,467
I SAID GOOD-BYE.

938
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:14,067
BUY ME A DRINK.

939
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,133
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

940
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:21,901
WHAT DO YOU HEAR
FROM THE PRESIDENT?

941
00:53:21,968 --> 00:53:25,367
HE TOO BUSY TO WRITE. BIG CRISIS.

942
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:28,033
SERIOUS WINE SHORTAGE.

943
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,067
IF THEY NEED ANY WINE,
THEY CAN RING ME UP.

944
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,767
WE ARE INVITED
TO PARTY TONIGHT, NANCY.

945
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:37,334
PARTY?
SURE. WHY NOT?

946
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,234
CELESTINO GOT MARRIED.
WEDDING SUPPER AT GIRL'S HOUSE.

947
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,334
CHU CHU, I DON'T
BELONG AT A WEDDING.

948
00:53:47,234 --> 00:53:49,067
IT'S ONE MORE MISTAKE
YOU MAKE.

949
00:54:23,934 --> 00:54:26,601
SHE'S A PRETTY KID,
CELESTINO'S GIRL.

950
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:29,634
SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE JUST STEPPED DOWN

951
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:31,400
OUT OF A STAINED
GLASS WINDOW.

952
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:34,133
MM-HMM.

953
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,534
CELESTINO IS
VERY HAPPY MAN.

954
00:54:37,601 --> 00:54:40,267
BUT IT'S HARD FOR
A STRANGER TO TELL.

955
00:54:40,334 --> 00:54:42,834
ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE
HIS STOMACH UPSET.

956
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:52,667
HOW I LOOK, HMM?

957
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:59,100
YOU LOOK LIKE THE
BRIDEGROOM OUGHT TO LOOK.

958
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:02,300
VERY GOOD REASON
FOR THAT.

959
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:04,601
I'D LIKE TO BE
BRIDEGROOM,

960
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:07,267
BUT WITH YOU IN WHITE DRESS AND VEIL.

961
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:11,701
CHU CHU, WHEN A GIRL
MARRIES FOR THE SECOND TIME,

962
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,501
SHE DOESN'T WEAR
A VEIL.

963
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:14,968
IT'S TRUE.

964
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:18,601
BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
MARRIED THE FIRST TIME.

965
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,901
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
LIEUTENANT WEBSON IS REAL?

966
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:22,534
OH, WEBSON REAL,
ALL RIGHT.

967
00:55:22,601 --> 00:55:24,901
MARRIAGE? UH-UH.

968
00:55:30,434 --> 00:55:34,067
I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE WITH YOU, CHU CHU.

969
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:35,734
NOT EASY TO SAY
FOR YOU,

970
00:55:35,801 --> 00:55:37,234
BUT FOR ME?

971
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,434
WOULD HAVE TO WRITE
HAPPINESS TO PRESIDENT AGAIN.

972
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:47,901
LISTEN, I TOLD YOU I
DIDN'T BELONG AT A WEDDING.

973
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:22,300
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.

974
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:23,501
THE RIGHT
KIND OF PEOPLE,

975
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:24,868
THE RIGHT
KIND OF MUSIC.

976
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:26,567
ONE THING I WOULD
KNOW, NANCY.

977
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:28,434
MY PEOPLE NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

978
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,534
LET'S SAY I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM.

979
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,334
IT'S PLAIN YOU NOT
LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU.

980
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,200
LOVE. I NEVER USE
THE WORD.

981
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,033
YOU'VE SPENT A LIFE

982
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,400
HIDING BACK OF
WISECRACKS,

983
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:50,901
BUT I WANT NO
WISECRACKS ABOUT YOU

984
00:56:50,968 --> 00:56:52,868
AND NOT EVEN
FROM YOU.

985
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:56,834
OK. HERE IT IS WITHOUT WIT OR HUMOR.

986
00:56:56,901 --> 00:56:59,801
I'M GETTING OUT OF
SACRAMENTO IN THE MORNING.

987
00:56:59,868 --> 00:57:00,934
I'M HEADING FOR
LOS ANGELES.

988
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:03,133
THE GAY LONDON DANCE
HALL. THIRD AND MAIN.

989
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,033
I NOT WANT YOU TO GO.
I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE,

990
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,434
BELONG WHERE I CAN
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

991
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:07,734
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH SENSE

992
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,300
TO PUT SOME MILEAGE
BETWEEN US,

993
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:10,300
I'M GOING TO DO IT
FOR YOU.

994
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:11,300
WHY?

995
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:12,434
YOU AFRAID
YOU'LL WIND UP

996
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:14,501
IN THAT WHITE DRESS
AND VEIL?

997
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,300
YOU AND ME
AND AMERICA.

998
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:21,601
THAT'D BE A THREESOME FOR A HONEYMOON.

999
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:23,400
YOU AFRAID, ALL RIGHT.

1000
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,901
YOU GO TO
LOS ANGELES.

1001
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:28,367
YOU GET
CHANGE OF CLIMATE.

1002
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:30,667
DIFFERENT BARS
WHERE AIR IS BETTER.

1003
00:57:30,734 --> 00:57:32,033
TAKE LOTS OF
DEEP BREATHING

1004
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,901
AND GET SUNTAN FROM
NEON LIGHTS.

1005
00:57:33,968 --> 00:57:36,968
MEET DISTINGUISHED BUMS IN
HIGH-CLASS, 20-CENT DUMPS,

1006
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:38,567
BUT YOU'LL NOT
GET RID OF ME.

1007
00:57:38,634 --> 00:57:40,067
LATER, I COME DOWN

1008
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:41,534
AND PICK YOU
OUT OF SAWDUST,

1009
00:57:41,601 --> 00:57:44,300
WASH YOUR FACE,
TAKE YOU HOME,

1010
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:45,634
AND MARRY YOU.

1011
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:00,767
GOT BIG THINGS
TO DO HERE FIRST.

1012
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:03,367
FINISH THE ASPARAGUS
AND GET WAGES.

1013
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:06,367
GET WAGES
AND FINISH WITH AMES.

1014
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:10,501
GOING TO TAKE WAGES
AND FINISH WITH YOU.

1015
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,267
AMES WILL ALWAYS
CHEAT YOU,

1016
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:14,868
JUST LIKE I WOULD.

1017
00:58:14,934 --> 00:58:17,601
I NOT WORRY
ABOUT AMES.

1018
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:19,267
PEOPLE MAKE THE LAW

1019
00:58:19,334 --> 00:58:21,934
AND PEOPLE MUST OBEY
THE LAW.

1020
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,667
I NOT SCARED.

1021
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,434
EVERYBODY'S SCARED.

1022
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,934
EVERYBODY
EXCEPT YOU.

1023
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,300
GO AHEAD, CHU CHU.

1024
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,400
YOU FIGHT AMES.

1025
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:38,567
FIGHT HIM ALWAYS, WHEREVER YOU FIND HIM.

1026
00:58:38,634 --> 00:58:40,033
FIGHT HIM FOR ME
AND EVERYBODY ELSE

1027
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,067
WHO'S TOO SCARED OR
WEAK TO FIGHT HIM...

1028
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:45,801
EVEN IF I'M NOT
AROUND TO SEE IT.

1029
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,367
AND I WON'T BE.

1030
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,834
ALL RIGHT, NANCY.

1031
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:04,601
YOU GO TO L.A.

1032
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:09,067
YOU THINK. YOU GET CURED
OF BEING LITTLE FOOL.

1033
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,234
THEN YOU UNLOCK DOOR FOR ME

1034
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,701
AND IT STAY THAT WAY.

1035
00:59:21,901 --> 00:59:23,133
SHUT UP!

1036
00:59:25,033 --> 00:59:26,534
TIME IS UP.

1037
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:29,434
LABOR BOARD RULE.
YOU PAY TODAY.

1038
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:30,834
I WAS BROKE
2 MONTHS AGO

1039
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,300
AND I'M
STILL BROKE.

1040
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:35,734
MAN HAVE NO MONEY,
HE DO WORK HIMSELF.

1041
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:37,467
HE NOT HIRE MAN
TO DO WORK

1042
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:40,100
AND THEN
CHEAT OF WAGES.

1043
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:43,734
AMES DON'T WORK.
HE'S A GENTLEMAN FARMER.

1044
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:46,634
I NOT WANT
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING,

1045
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:48,400
BUT I NOT WANT
NOTHING FOR SOMETHING.

1046
00:59:48,467 --> 00:59:50,434
WHEN I WORK,
I GET PAID.

1047
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:51,634
I HAVE RIGHTS.

1048
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,200
YOU GOT NO RIGHTS AROUND HERE

1049
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:54,567
UNLESS I GIVE
THEM TO YOU.

1050
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,667
NOW, GET OUT.

1051
00:59:59,734 --> 01:00:01,667
IT'S BAD THING
TO DO TO A MAN.

1052
01:00:01,734 --> 01:00:03,267
MAKE HIM FEEL ASHAMED.

1053
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,634
MAKE HIM FEEL SMALL.

1054
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,701
I'M NOT MAKING YOU
FEEL SMALL, RAMIREZ.

1055
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:08,567
YOU WERE SMALL
TO START WITH.

1056
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:11,267
TIME COMES WHEN
A MAN MUST MAKE A STAND.

1057
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:13,834
SELF-RESPECT TELLS
FEET TO STOP WALKING.

1058
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,701
COMMON SENSE BETTER TELL
THEM TO START AGAIN.

1059
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:22,234
THEY START. THIS TIME,
THEY GO THE RIGHT WAY.

1060
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,968
THE RIGHT WAY TO GET
YOURSELF BLOWN APART!

1061
01:00:25,033 --> 01:00:28,167
BETTER TO GET BLOWN APART
THAN TO FALL APART.

1062
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,367
IN CASE YOU THINK
YOU'VE GROWN ANY,

1063
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:36,601
IT AIN'T LOADED.

1064
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:47,601
VALUABLE GUN.
SHOOT WHEN NOT LOADED.

1065
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:50,801
MY ADVICE IS,
SELL GUN AND PAY RAMIREZ.

1066
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:55,834
PAY RAMIREZ TOMORROW,
OR GO TO JAIL FOR BUM CHECK.

1067
01:00:58,133 --> 01:00:59,133
UNH!

1068
01:01:05,434 --> 01:01:07,868
HOW BIG ARE YOU NOW,
AMES?

1069
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:21,200
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
SHOOT HIM IN THE BACK,

1070
01:01:21,267 --> 01:01:23,701
HE'S GOT A WITNESS. ME!

1071
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:30,067
A LOVING WIFE DON'T
TESTIFY AGAINST HER HUSBAND.

1072
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:32,067
NOT THIS HUSBAND!

1073
01:01:32,133 --> 01:01:36,534
NOT IF SHE WANTS
TO STAY ALIVE.

1074
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:40,434
QUESTION IS, SHOULD SHE
BE ALLOWED TO STAY ALIVE?

1075
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,901
SHE CHEATS AROUND
WITH A MEXICAN,

1076
01:01:42,968 --> 01:01:46,400
THEN THE MEXICAN SAYS
I'M CHEATING HIM!

1077
01:01:46,467 --> 01:01:49,767
THE WAY I FIGURE IT,
HE OWES ME SOMETHING!

1078
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:52,467
YOU'RE WRONG,
BUT I WISH YOU WERE RIGHT.

1079
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,267
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU,
AMES?

1080
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:58,868
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THE GUY I MARRIED?

1081
01:01:58,934 --> 01:02:00,067
YOU HAPPENED TO ME!

1082
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,267
IF I HAPPENED TO YOU,
AMES,

1083
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:06,033
THEN YOU SURE
HAPPENED TO ME.

1084
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,334
CHU CHU IS WORTH
10 OF YOU,

1085
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,634
AND HE JUST PROVED IT.

1086
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:14,434
I AIN'T GONNA KILL YOU.

1087
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:15,767
NOT QUITE.

1088
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,901
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK
A LITTLE DEAD FOR A WHILE.

1089
01:02:45,634 --> 01:02:48,567
I OUGHT TO LET YOU
BLEED TO DEATH.

1090
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:52,501
MAYBE I SHOULD PAY
RAMIREZ OFF IN BLOOD.

1091
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:56,567
YOU HAVEN'T GOT $90 WORTH.

1092
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:59,634
I'LL PAY HIM OFF THOUGH.

1093
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:02,167
HE DID THIS.

1094
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:04,501
YOU'RE GONNA SAY HE DID IT.

1095
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:06,300
I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL FOR ANY BUM CHECK.

1096
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:07,300
HE'S GOING.

1097
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:12,133
I THINK I WILL LET YOU
BLEED TO DEATH.

1098
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,334
OH NO YOU WON'T.

1099
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,667
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I BLEED SLOW.

1100
01:03:20,734 --> 01:03:23,667
AND I'D LAST LONG ENOUGH TO SAY TO THEM

1101
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:26,200
THAT BEFORE RAMIREZ SHOT ME
YOU PUT HIM UP.

1102
01:03:28,968 --> 01:03:31,534
NOW CALL THE SHERIFF!

1103
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:33,267
THEN GET A DOCTOR.

1104
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,033
HOME KIND OF EARLY,
AIN'T YOU?

1105
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,734
IF YOU CALL THIS A HOME.

1106
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:04,067
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
LOSE YOUR JOB?

1107
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:06,167
I CAN GO BACK.

1108
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:10,701
IF I CRAWL ON MY HANDS
AND KNEES AND HOLD MY NOSE.

1109
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:13,868
THAT'S QUITE A TRICK IF YOU CAN DO IT.

1110
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,901
NANCY, WHERE DO
YOUR FOLKS LIVE?

1111
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:17,634
THAT'S THE CATCH.
THEY DON'T.

1112
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:22,634
WELL, FRIENDS, THEN. YOU
MUST HAVE SOME FRIENDS AROUND.

1113
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:27,634
JUST EL COVINO,
MY ONLY NEXT OF KIN.

1114
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:31,701
KINDLY NOTIFY
IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.

1115
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,167
SO I GET THIS PHONE CALL AT
THE BAR FROM THIS LANDLADY.

1116
01:04:36,234 --> 01:04:39,467
SHE GETS MY NUMBER OFF A
CARD IN NANCY'S POCKETBOOK.

1117
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:41,467
SHE SAYS THE KID'S
PRETTY SICK,

1118
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:44,133
DO I KNOW ANYBODY CARES
ENOUGH TO COME ON DOWN.

1119
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,133
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY I EVER
SEEN NANCY WITH MORE THAN ONCE,

1120
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,133
SO I FIGURE YOU CARE.

1121
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,701
YOU'RE RIGHT, FRANKIE.
THANKS.

1122
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,701
WHAT ABOUT ARREST
FOR AMES, CHUCHU?

1123
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:01,734
AMES WAITS. EVERYTHING WAITS FOR NANCY.

1124
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,701
GOING FAR?

1125
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:27,067
MIGHT MAKE IT SHORT. THE D.A.'S
WAITING TO SEE RAMIREZ.

1126
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,133
FIGURE YOU GOT PLENTY TIME TO READ.

1127
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,542
BRING BOOK D
- DEMOCRACY TO...

1128
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:40,667
REMINDS ME. THAT BOOK'S BIG
ENOUGH TO HOLD A PNEUMATIC DRILL.

1129
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,634
THE PAPERS SAY YOU
HELD FOR TRIAL, CHUCHU.

1130
01:05:44,635 --> 01:05:46,667
ALL OVER FRONT PAGE.
ASSAULT WITH DEADLY WEAPON.

1131
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,718
I NO WORRY ABOUT TRIAL.
IT BE FAIR. TRUTH COME OUT.

1132
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:52,701
NOW, WHEN YOU SEE NANCY.
HOW SHE LOOK AND WHAT SHE SAY?

1133
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,290
SHE NOT LOOK GOOD.
SHE SAY NOTHING.

1134
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:58,950
WE'LL TRY TO RAISE BAIL.
BUT JUDGE MAKE IT VERY HIGH.

1135
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:02,000
WE TAKE TIME.
MAYBE NOT ABLE TO RAISE IT AT ALL.

1136
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,701
WHAT YOU MEAN
SHE SAY NOTHING?

1137
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:11,031
SHE PRETTY SICK.
SHE TURN ON GAS.

1138
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:12,404
NOT KILL HERSELF. ONLY TRY.

1139
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:14,100
THEY BUST DOWN DOOR TOO SOON.

1140
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:20,166
MAYBE GAS WAS ACCIDENT.

1141
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,634
ONLY ACCIDENT WAS SOMEBODY
STOPPING HER.

1142
01:06:23,701 --> 01:06:26,100
SHE LEFT NOTE MENTION YOU.

1143
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,667
IT SAY...

1144
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:32,601
"TO LANDLADY,
MY APOLOGIES. "

1145
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:36,701
"TO FRIEND RAMIREZ, MY LOVE. "

1146
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:43,701
"TO REST OF WORLD,
GET LOST."

1147
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:50,667
PRETTY GOOD NOTE.

1148
01:06:50,734 --> 01:06:52,701
SAY EVERYTHING.

1149
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:56,133
AFRAID YOUR TIME
IS UP.

1150
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,133
KEEP THE D.A. WAITING,
HE GETS KIND OF ITCHY.

1151
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,667
THERE WAS A REAL GOOD PIECE
IN THERE ABOUT DIESEL ENGINES.

1152
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:06,734
MOE, SEE THIS BOY
FINDS THE DOOR.

1153
01:07:08,133 --> 01:07:10,167
WE'LL DO OUR BEST
ABOUT BAIL.

1154
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:21,634
SORRY, RAMIREZ.

1155
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:25,167
THE D.A. LIKES TO MAKE EVERYTHING
LOOK REAL DESPERATE.

1156
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:31,634
I'M NOT SAYING YOU DIDN'T HAVE
WHAT THEY CALL PROVOCATION.

1157
01:07:31,701 --> 01:07:33,100
YOU HAD PLENTY.

1158
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:35,667
AMES GIVE YOU A GOOD SHOVING
AROUND AND...

1159
01:07:35,734 --> 01:07:39,667
WHAT WITH THAT MRS. AMES
WAVING HERSELF AT YOU.

1160
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:41,667
YOU KNOW, IF I WAS IN YOUR FIX

1161
01:07:41,734 --> 01:07:43,133
I'D TAKE A PLEA.

1162
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,667
YOU'D DO BETTER WITH A JUDGE NOW
THAN A JURY LATER ON.

1163
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:50,667
MIGHT EVEN GET OFF WITH
AS LITTLE AS 3 YEARS.

1164
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,667
AND IF YOU STAND TRIAL
IT COULD EASILY BE TEN.

1165
01:07:53,734 --> 01:07:57,133
YOU MEAN A JUDGE WOULD TAKE OFF
7 YEARS IF I LIED?

1166
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,734
YOU'RE AN AGGRAVATING GUY,
RAMIREZ.

1167
01:08:01,734 --> 01:08:04,334
HEY, HOW'S ABOUT WETTING
YOUR BACK TEETH, BOY?

1168
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,701
THANKS.

1169
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,601
WON'T TALK.

1170
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,667
REMINDS ME OF YOU.

1171
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,701
ATOM BOMB SHOULD FALL ON THE GUY
THAT INVENTED THIS THING.

1172
01:08:49,734 --> 01:08:52,734
SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD.

1173
01:11:09,701 --> 01:11:11,701
HERE! WHAT THE-

1174
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,701
CHU CHU.

1175
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:28,634
I DREAMED
YOU'D COME HERE

1176
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,300
AND PICK ME UP
OUT OF THE SAWDUST,

1177
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:33,968
TO WASH MY FACE
AND TAKE ME HOME.

1178
01:11:34,033 --> 01:11:35,634
AND MARRY YOU.

1179
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:39,167
OH, WHY DIDN'T YOU
MAKE A BREAK FOR IT?

1180
01:11:39,234 --> 01:11:40,667
YOU GOT AWAY.

1181
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:44,167
WHY DID YOU COME TO THE ONE
PLACE WHERE YOU HAD TO LOSE?

1182
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:46,234
WHERE ELSE WOULD I GO?

1183
01:11:47,734 --> 01:11:50,167
YOU WALKED RIGHT
INTO THEIR ARMS.

1184
01:11:50,234 --> 01:11:52,501
NO. I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THE TRIAL.

1185
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:54,634
I ONLY WORRY ABOUT YOU.

1186
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:58,133
ALSO BECAUSE YOU SAY
MAGIC WORD IN NOTE.

1187
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,234
"TO FRIEND RAMIREZ,
MY LOVE."

1188
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:09,601
WHATEVER CHOICE,
RAMIREZ...

1189
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:11,667
MY LOVE.

1190
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,634
SAY IT BACK TO ME,
QUICK.

1191
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:20,634
I SAY IT TO YOU NOW
WHEN I ALWAYS SAY IT.

1192
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:23,667
EVERYBODY ELSE HEAR ME, NANCY. NOT YOU?

1193
01:12:25,167 --> 01:12:29,667
I HEARD YOU, BUT I
WOULDN'T LET MYSELF LISTEN.

1194
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:37,534
THERE'S TOO MANY MEN
AT THE DOOR.

1195
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:41,667
PROMISE TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

1196
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:45,634
NO MORE OF THIS
TURN ON GAS THING.

1197
01:12:45,701 --> 01:12:48,167
YOU PROMISE TO
WAIT FOR ME,

1198
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:51,634
THEN THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF, NOWHERE,

1199
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,267
FOR YOU, NANCY,
OR FOR ME.

1200
01:12:59,234 --> 01:13:01,200
I PROMISE.

1201
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,634
ALL RISE FOR
HIS HONOR, JUDGE WELLS,

1202
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:30,634
SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE FOR THE
COUNTY OF MISSION, CALIFORNIA.

1203
01:13:30,701 --> 01:13:32,667
ALL THOSE HAVING BUSINESS
WITH THIS COURT,

1204
01:13:32,734 --> 01:13:34,634
DRAW NEAR, GIVE YOUR ATTENTION,
AND YOU SHALL BE HEARD.

1205
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,701
COURT IS NOW
IN SESSION.

1206
01:13:47,434 --> 01:13:50,167
I ADMIT THAT I COULDN'T
PAY HIM RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

1207
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:52,667
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WAS GONNA CHEAT HIM.

1208
01:13:52,734 --> 01:13:55,067
I HAD THE MONEY
WAITING FOR HIM.

1209
01:13:55,133 --> 01:13:58,067
WELL, FIRST THING I KNEW, I HEARD
HER HOLLERING UP AT THE HOUSE.

1210
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:02,801
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,
HE WAS BEATING ON HER.

1211
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:06,334
AS SOON AS HE SAW MY HUSBAND,
HE KNOCKED HIM DOWN.

1212
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,300
I TRIED TO FIGHT HIM OFF.

1213
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:11,601
THEN HE GRABBED THE GUN
OFF THE WALL AND SHOT HIM

1214
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:13,868
WHILE HE WAS LYING THERE,
HELPLESS.

1215
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:16,701
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T HAVE
A CHANCE.

1216
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,501
MY COUSIN A GOOD MAN.
WORKED HARD.

1217
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,968
NEVER GIVE TROUBLE
TO NO ONE. NOT EVER.

1218
01:14:25,033 --> 01:14:27,801
NEVER SEEN HIM GET MAD,
LOSE TEMPER.

1219
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:29,634
PLENTY OF THINGS
TO GET MAD ABOUT,

1220
01:14:29,701 --> 01:14:32,267
BUT CHU CHU NOT GET MAD.

1221
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,100
ALWAYS PAY DEBTS.

1222
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:36,033
VERY HONEST FELLA.

1223
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,634
MAKE GOOD ON BUM CHECK
OF AMES.

1224
01:14:38,701 --> 01:14:43,234
HE'S NOT THE KIND THAT
GOES AROUND HURTING PEOPLE.

1225
01:14:44,701 --> 01:14:46,400
THEY HURT HIM.

1226
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:49,167
HE WON'T EVER
HURT THEM BACK.

1227
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:51,601
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ENEMY.

1228
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,667
'S THE BEST MAN
I EVER MET...

1229
01:14:54,734 --> 01:14:56,734
AND A KIND ONE.

1230
01:14:58,734 --> 01:15:00,234
THAT'S IT.

1231
01:15:02,934 --> 01:15:05,200
OH, I-I NOT THE BEST
OF MEN,

1232
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,901
BUT I'M NOT THE WORST.

1233
01:15:06,968 --> 01:15:08,601
I NEVER BEAT WOMEN.

1234
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,667
I NOT LOVE HER.

1235
01:15:10,734 --> 01:15:13,601
BUT WHEN I BE LIED TO,

1236
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:16,601
I NOT GET SHOT BY ANYBODY,

1237
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:20,100
AND I NOT SHOOT ANYBODY.

1238
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:23,167
AND BEFORE ALL,
BEFORE THE JUDGE AND THE JURY,

1239
01:15:23,234 --> 01:15:25,133
BEFORE MY ENEMIES
AND MY FRIENDS,

1240
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,634
I SAY THIS:

1241
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:28,701
WHAT I HAVE TELL YOU
IS TRUE.

1242
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:53,167
CHU CHU, THE LAWYER SAYS WE
STILL HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE.

1243
01:15:53,234 --> 01:15:55,667
I FIND OUT SOMETHING
IN THAT COURTROOM.

1244
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:58,701
ONLY GOOD CHANCE
I HAVE IS TO LOSE.

1245
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:02,234
THAT WOMAN WAS LYING. EVERYBODY KNEW IT.

1246
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:05,667
FUNNY THING ABOUT LYING.

1247
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:07,167
A LIE GET LOOSE,

1248
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,968
CAN LOOK JUST AS GOOD
AS THE TRUTH.

1249
01:16:09,033 --> 01:16:11,601
HOW PEOPLE CAN KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE?

1250
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:15,100
YOU GO TO DOCTOR
LIKE I SAY?

1251
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,734
YEAH, I GO TO DOCTOR
LIKE YOU SAY.

1252
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:19,567
AND, WHAT HE TELL YOU?

1253
01:16:19,634 --> 01:16:21,567
GAVE ME SOME
SWELL ADVICE.

1254
01:16:21,634 --> 01:16:25,100
DON'T WORRY. RELAX.
EAT NOURISHING FOOD.

1255
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:27,188
GET PLENTY OF SLEEP.

1256
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:28,300
KEEP HAPPY.

1257
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:31,801
WELL, THIS MIGHT...

1258
01:16:31,868 --> 01:16:34,701
I GIVE SAME MEDICINE,
DIFFERENT APPEARANCE.

1259
01:16:38,701 --> 01:16:40,200
RELAX.

1260
01:16:41,701 --> 01:16:43,701
GET NOURISHMENT.

1261
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:48,701
SLEEP. PLENTY SLEEP.

1262
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,701
THINK HAPPY.

1263
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:58,200
DEFENDANT WILL RISE,
FACE THE JURY.

1264
01:16:59,701 --> 01:17:02,667
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE JURY,
HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT?

1265
01:17:02,734 --> 01:17:04,567
WE HAVE,
YOUR HONOR.

1266
01:17:04,634 --> 01:17:06,167
HOW SAY YOU THEN?

1267
01:17:06,234 --> 01:17:10,334
IS THE DEFENDANT CHU CHU RAMIREZ
GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY AS CHARGED?

1268
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,901
UH, CAN I SAY THIS
IN MY OWN WORDS, JUDGE?

1269
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:16,601
YOU MAY.

1270
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:21,133
WELL, WE FIGURE RAMIREZ
DID THE JOB ALL RIGHT,

1271
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:27,100
BUT WE ALSO FIGURE THAT MAYBE
IF WE'D HAD TO TAKE WHAT HE DID

1272
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,100
WE'D HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING.

1273
01:17:29,167 --> 01:17:33,667
SO OUR VERDICT IS GUILTY
OF ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

1274
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,634
BUT WE'D LIKE TO ASK,
YOUR HONOR,

1275
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:40,634
TO GO LIGHT
WHEN YOU PASS SENTENCE.

1276
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:43,200
WE'D TAKE THAT
AS A FAVOR.

1277
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,133
CHU CHU RAMIREZ,

1278
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,200
HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY
BEFORE SENTENCE IS PRONOUNCED?

1279
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:56,667
I NOT WISH TO
WASTE ANY TIME.

1280
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:59,133
BETTER TO USE TIME
SERVING SENTENCE.

1281
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,601
BUT A FEW WORDS
MUST BE SPOKE,

1282
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:04,601
AND I WILL NOW SPEAK THEM.

1283
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:07,868
IS HERE IN MY HAND A LETTER
I HAVE WRITE TO THE PRESIDENT.

1284
01:18:07,968 --> 01:18:09,634
THE PRESIDENT?

1285
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:11,701
PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.

1286
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:16,667
YOU MAY READ IT.

1287
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:19,567
THESE ARE THE WORDS.

1288
01:18:19,634 --> 01:18:22,267
"DEAR FRIEND,
I NOW AGAIN WRITE TO YOU

1289
01:18:22,334 --> 01:18:25,067
"BECAUSE I AM AFRAID YOU'D
READ ABOUT ME IN NEWSPAPERS

1290
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,567
"AND NOT UNDERSTAND.

1291
01:18:27,634 --> 01:18:31,200
"BEFORE WHEN I WRITE, IT WAS A
FINE THING THAT HAPPENED TO ME.

1292
01:18:31,267 --> 01:18:33,067
"I AM BECOME A CITIZEN.

1293
01:18:33,133 --> 01:18:35,067
"THIS TIME
IS A BAD THING.

1294
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:38,067
"I AM IN JAIL FOR
SOMETHING I NOT DO.

1295
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:41,567
"AND IF I AM CONVICT,
I NO LONGER AM CITIZEN.

1296
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,634
"THIS TO ME
IS WORTHY TO DIE.

1297
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:47,267
"I ALWAYS REMEMBER
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET

1298
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:50,601
"WHAT YOU TELL ME ABOUT
THIS COUNTRY AND ITS LAWS.

1299
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:52,634
"IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE LAW,

1300
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:56,934
"ONLY WITH HOW THE LAW IS TURNED
AROUND AND TWISTED BY SOME PEOPLES.

1301
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,667
"FOR IF LAW IS TURNED AROUND
AND TWISTED TOO MUCH, IT BREAK,

1302
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:03,667
"AND THERE'S NOTHING
FOR NOBODY.

1303
01:19:03,734 --> 01:19:05,968
"AND NO LONGER IS
THIS COUNTRY SOMETHING.

1304
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:10,067
"MR. PRESIDENT,
THIS IS A GOOD COUNTRY,

1305
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:13,567
"A BIG COUNTRY
WITH GOOD, STRONG LAW,

1306
01:19:13,634 --> 01:19:16,601
"AND IS MORE GOOD PEOPLE
THAN BAD.

1307
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:21,100
"LIKE ALL BIG THINGS, IT
GOES SLOW, MR. PRESIDENT,

1308
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:23,601
"AND IT GO VERY SURE.

1309
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:26,667
FROM YOUR FRIEND,
CHU CHU RAMIREZ."

1310
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:31,634
THAT IS ALL I HAVE
TO SAY, MR. YOUR HONOR.

1311
01:19:46,634 --> 01:19:48,067
HELLO, BOYS.

1312
01:19:48,133 --> 01:19:49,100
HELLO.

1313
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,634
HI, SHERIFF.

1314
01:19:50,701 --> 01:19:52,200
BEERS, ALL AROUND.

1315
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:57,634
YOU HONESTLY THINK CHU CHU
SHOOT THAT BIG SLOB AMES?

1316
01:19:57,701 --> 01:20:00,200
I NEVER ARGUE
WITH A JURY.

1317
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:13,567
CHU CHU WOULDN'T NEED THAT
GUN TO TAKE CARE OF AMES.

1318
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:18,100
IF THERE WAS 2 AMES, CHU
CHU NEED ONLY HIS 2 HANDS.

1319
01:20:20,133 --> 01:20:23,601
WE HAD A MAN OVER
IN THE JAIL ONCE,

1320
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:26,601
CHARGED WITH KILLING
ANOTHER FELLA.

1321
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:28,634
WOULDN'T ADMIT IT.

1322
01:20:28,701 --> 01:20:31,267
AND LIED FASTER THAN
A DOG COULD TROT.

1323
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:33,667
FINALLY, THE D.A.
GOT AN IDEA.

1324
01:20:35,167 --> 01:20:37,434
HE PUT THIS FELLA
IN A ROOM,

1325
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,767
RIGHT SPANK IN
THE MIDDLE OF IT,

1326
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:44,100
AND ALL OF US JUST SAT
AROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM.

1327
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:47,601
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

1328
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:50,601
JUST SAT AND
LOOKED AT HIM.

1329
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:53,167
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

1330
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:58,634
PRETTY SOON, THAT FELLA BROKE
DOWN AND CRIED LIKE A BABY.

1331
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,667
AND TALK? WELL,
YOU COULDN'T STOP HIM.

1332
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,167
TOLD THE TRUTH, TOO.

1333
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,868
SOME KIND OF LESSON
IN THAT, I GUESS.

1334
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,467
SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY
TO DRAW BLOOD ON A MAN

1335
01:21:17,534 --> 01:21:20,167
IS JUST STAND STILL
AND LOOK AT HIM.

1336
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,133
IF YOU'RE RIGHT
AND HE'S WRONG,

1337
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,200
YOU CAN BLEED 'EM
TO DEATH THAT WAY.

1338
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,734
SO LONG, BOYS.

1339
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,167
THANK YOU, SHERIFF.

1340
01:21:34,234 --> 01:21:36,667
THANK ME?
FOR WHAT?

1341
01:21:36,734 --> 01:21:38,734
FOR THE BEER.

1342
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:46,734
SOUND LIKE POKER
GAME WITHOUT CARDS.

1343
01:21:49,834 --> 01:21:53,167
AND RAMIREZ WAS
SENTENCED TO A TERM OF ONE YEAR AND A DAY.

1344
01:21:53,234 --> 01:21:54,834
A YEAR AND A DAY.

1345
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:58,834
FOR ONCE I'M EVEN GONNA ENJOY
EATING ONE OF YOUR BUM MEALS,

1346
01:21:58,901 --> 01:22:00,667
UNLESS YOU'VE
POISONED THE FOOD.

1347
01:22:00,734 --> 01:22:02,701
THAT WAY,
I'D ENJOY IT.

1348
01:22:02,767 --> 01:22:06,200
FROM THE LOOKS OF YOU, YOU'D
ENJOY EATING SOME OF IT YOURSELF.

1349
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:09,667
THE WORLD WOULD LOSE
A FINE PAIR.

1350
01:22:09,734 --> 01:22:13,200
SWEETLY WOMAN,
BIG, HONEST MAN.

1351
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,801
GET OFF THIS PLACE,
AND GET OFF FAST!

1352
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:22,133
CAME TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.

1353
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,701
SLEEP GOOD.
EAT GOOD, TOO.

1354
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,200
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
THEY'RE AFTER?

1355
01:23:22,701 --> 01:23:24,133
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.

1356
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,701
THEY'RE AFTER YOUR WIFE, LIKE RAMIREZ.

1357
01:23:29,734 --> 01:23:32,200
THEY'RE AFTER US.

1358
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,701
YOU AIN'T OUT OF HERE IN AN
HOUR, I'M CALLIN' THE SHERIFF!

1359
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:36,634
THAT'S WHAT THE MEXICANS HAVE
GOT A SPOT ALL PICKED OUT FOR.

1360
01:27:36,701 --> 01:27:38,667
RIGHT NEXT TO NIKKI.

1361
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:41,634
KILL IT, AMES.
KILL IT.

1362
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:44,701
JUST GO AHEAD AND
KILL THIS KITTEN.

1363
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,601
GET OFF THE PLACE,
YOU DRUNKEN TRAMP!

1364
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:37,234
SHE'S NOT DRUNK,
SHE'S SICK.

1365
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:40,667
DRUNK OR SICK,
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

1366
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,634
HOW DO YOU
SIT THERE EATING

1367
01:28:46,701 --> 01:28:48,467
AND NOT CHOKE TO DEATH?

1368
01:28:48,534 --> 01:28:51,634
YOU PUT AN INNOCENT MAN
IN JAIL WITH LIES.

1369
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:55,167
HE'S GONNA ROT HIS LIFE
AWAY THERE,

1370
01:28:55,234 --> 01:28:56,701
UNLESS YOU TELL THE TRUTH.

1371
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:03,667
YOU CHEATED HIM,
AND THEN YOU STALLED HIM.

1372
01:29:03,734 --> 01:29:06,667
THEN YOU RAN HIM
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

1373
01:29:06,734 --> 01:29:11,067
WHEN HE WOULDN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE, YOU LIED AWAY HIS FREEDOM

1374
01:29:11,133 --> 01:29:13,334
AND HIS CITIZENSHIP.

1375
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,634
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO WALK AWAY AND FORGET IT,

1376
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:19,601
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

1377
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:23,601
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT NOW,
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT OUT.

1378
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:27,667
THOSE GUYS DOWN THERE, THEY'RE
GONNA QUIT ON YOU AFTER A WHILE.

1379
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:31,667
SO WILL I.
WE'LL BE GONE.

1380
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:36,667
BUT YOU TWO WILL
NEVER BE GONE.

1381
01:29:39,701 --> 01:29:43,167
WHEREVER HE STAYS,
HE LEAVES HIS MARK...

1382
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:48,667
EVEN ON SOMEONE LIKE ME.

1383
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,634
EVEN ON SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

1384
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:55,300
I'D TAKE IT EASY
IF I WAS YOU.

1385
01:29:55,367 --> 01:29:56,701
BUT YOU'RE NOT ME.

1386
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:04,200
AND BECAUSE I KNEW CHU CHU,
I'M NEVER GONNA BE LIKE YOU.

1387
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,133
AND FOR THAT,
I GIVE THANKS.

1388
01:30:29,701 --> 01:30:32,567
NEAR KILLED HERSELF.

1389
01:30:32,634 --> 01:30:34,667
I'M NOT SO SURE
SHE DIDN'T.

1390
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:48,133
WE'LL HOLD THIS
AGAINST YOU, TOO.

1391
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,634
GET HER TO A DOCTOR,
QUICK.

1392
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,133
NANCY NOT GET BETTER,

1393
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,300
YOU GET A WHOLE LOT WORSE.

1394
01:31:16,934 --> 01:31:20,133
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER.

1395
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:25,133
WHETHER THE FIRST ROTTEN
THING WE DID WAS TO EACH OTHER

1396
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,434
OR TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

1397
01:31:27,501 --> 01:31:31,667
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T WORRY WHAT
THE FIRST ROTTEN THING WAS.

1398
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:37,234
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST TRY TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT OUR LAST ONE WILL BE.

1399
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:37,133
ALL THE TIME
THAT GIRL WAS TALKING,

1400
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,701
I KEPT THINKING...

1401
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:41,734
I USED TO BE LIKE HER.

1402
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:45,167
YOU WERE?

1403
01:32:45,234 --> 01:32:49,667
THAT ONCE I'D HAVE DONE
JUST WHAT SHE DID.

1404
01:32:49,734 --> 01:32:52,400
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE DONE IT FOR ME.

1405
01:32:56,234 --> 01:32:59,167
IS IT TOO LATE
FOR US?

1406
01:32:59,234 --> 01:33:02,200
IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT
THAT ISN'T SPOILED?

1407
01:33:02,267 --> 01:33:06,667
I WORKED ALL MY LIFE.

1408
01:33:06,734 --> 01:33:09,133
YOU SEE WHERE
IT'S GOT US.

1409
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,133
SURE WE WORKED,

1410
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,734
BUT AT THE WRONG THINGS
IN THE WRONG WAY.

1411
01:33:16,701 --> 01:33:18,634
CAN'T GO BACK.

1412
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:20,701
NOBODY CAN.

1413
01:33:22,234 --> 01:33:23,667
NOT ALL THE WAY,

1414
01:33:23,734 --> 01:33:26,133
BUT IF WE WENT IN
TO THERE TO DRURY

1415
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,634
AND GOT THAT MEXICAN
OFF THE HOOK...

1416
01:33:28,701 --> 01:33:32,167
GET HIM OFF THE HOOK
AND GET OURSELVES ON.

1417
01:33:32,234 --> 01:33:35,701
WHAT WE DID WAS PERJURY.
THAT MEANS JAIL.

1418
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:40,367
WHERE ELSE HAVE WE BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?

1419
01:33:43,734 --> 01:33:46,067
NOBODY CAN GO BACK,
I TELL YOU.

1420
01:33:47,734 --> 01:33:49,767
NOT 15 YEARS.

1421
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:53,234
I'M GOING BACK.

1422
01:33:54,734 --> 01:33:57,734
I'M GOING IN THERE
AND FREE RAMIREZ.

1423
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:02,734
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO
KILL ME TO STOP ME.

1424
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,634
I HATE TO SEE YOU
GO, RAMIREZ.

1425
01:34:31,701 --> 01:34:33,634
I KNOW HOW TO TAKE
A DIESEL DOWN NOW

1426
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:36,133
AND I WAS JUST FINDING
OUT HOW TO PUT IT BACK UP.

1427
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,467
THAT'S NO WAY
TO LEAVE A MACHINE.

1428
01:34:38,534 --> 01:34:41,467
HERE. IS GETTING A
PRESENT, FROM ME TO YOU.

1429
01:34:41,534 --> 01:34:45,601
OH, THANKS. I'LL RETURN
IT AFTER I'VE READ IT.

1430
01:34:45,667 --> 01:34:48,667
BE A SHAME TO
BREAK UP THE SET.

1431
01:34:52,701 --> 01:34:55,767
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I OWE YOU ONE.

1432
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:14,667
OH, IT'S BROKEN.

1433
01:35:22,667 --> 01:35:25,701
TO MR. AMES
AND MRS. AMES.

1434
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,634
MRS. AMES.

1435
01:35:32,701 --> 01:35:36,601
YOU KNOW, RAMIREZ,

1436
01:35:36,667 --> 01:35:38,601
IF I STOPPED
BELIEVING IN CONSCIENCE,

1437
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,367
I'D TURN IN MY BADGE.

1438
01:35:42,167 --> 01:35:43,667
TO MRS. AMES.

1439
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,200
LONG MAY SHE WAVE.

1440
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,667
CHU CHU!

1441
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:10,133
OH, BROTHER!

1442
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:17,167
FULL HOUSE!

1443
01:36:24,167 --> 01:36:27,601
HAVE BIG JOB
IN THE PEACH FIELDS.

1444
01:36:27,667 --> 01:36:29,667
3 MORE CROPS,
AND YOU'RE MINE.

1445
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,634
LIKE INSTALLING
WASHING MACHINE.

1446
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:35,734
WONDERFUL SYSTEM.

1447
01:36:38,234 --> 01:36:40,801
I WANT TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOU.

1448
01:36:40,868 --> 01:36:42,267
REALLY, I DO.

1449
01:36:42,334 --> 01:36:46,801
I'M MUCH BETTER
THAT YOU EVER HAPPENED.

1450
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:49,734
I'M NOT SO SURE
YOU EVER DID.

1451
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,701
YOU SAY GOOD-BYE
LIKE I SAY HELLO.

1452
01:37:01,701 --> 01:37:05,667
BUT IT'S NOT SO EASY
AS YOU MAKE IT SEEM.

1453
01:37:05,734 --> 01:37:07,334
WE NEVER SAY GOOD-BYE

1454
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,601
WHEN BOTH OF US
BREATHE IN AND OUT.

1455
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:11,100
NURSE!

1456
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:13,167
THIS GUY'S-

1457
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:19,601
PLEASE STOP.

1458
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,634
I CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.

1459
01:37:21,701 --> 01:37:23,667
TIME YOU CARED
A LITTLE.

1460
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:28,100
WHAT HAVE I GOT
TO GIVE YOU?

1461
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:30,667
EVERYTHING I WANT,
IS ALL.

1462
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:34,601
I NEED YOU, NANCY,

1463
01:37:34,667 --> 01:37:36,701
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU.

1464
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,701
TO ME, ALWAYS,
YOU'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

1465
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,501
OH, BUT CHU CHU-

1466
01:37:43,567 --> 01:37:46,701
OH, PLEASE. YOU ASKED ME.
LET ME ANSWER.

1467
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,634
I NEED YOU, 'CAUSE...

1468
01:37:49,701 --> 01:37:52,634
I'M SICK OF...

1469
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:55,133
AND AFRAID.

1470
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,133
AS THE LOST DAYS
GROW INTO YEARS TO ME,

1471
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,634
YOU ARE ALONE.

1472
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:04,133
YOU'VE GOT TO GET WELL.

1473
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,067
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY,
NANCY.

1474
01:38:07,133 --> 01:38:08,634
TRY.

1475
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:15,100
I WILL.

1476
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:18,100
I'LL TRY.

1477
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:22,100
YOU WON'T BE ALONE
ANYMORE, CHU CHU.

1478
01:38:22,167 --> 01:38:23,667
OH, HOW I'LL TRY.

1479
01:38:25,167 --> 01:38:27,167
OH, CHU CHU.

1480
01:38:28,167 --> 01:38:30,133
THE HAT, CHU CHU.

1481
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,167
DON'T STEP ON THAT HAT.
