1
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,504
No! What are you doing? No!
No Margaret! No!

2
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,680
No Margaret! No!

3
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,804
Margaret!

4
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:18,804
THE CURSE OF THE VAMPIRE

5
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,777
People's idols are silver and gold which are 

6
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,609
the work of men's hands.

7
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,701
They have mouths and speak not.
They have eyes and see not.

8
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:20,179
They have ears but hear not.
Lord...

9
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,331
May thy infinite light

10
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,449
enlightens his way to eternity.

11
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,650
Dr. Mersch was a great man.

12
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,401
Thank you Mr Baron for using your influence to send us

13
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,449
a doctor as soon as possible.

14
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:12,962
As mayor 

15
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:16,993
I must confess my concern at the strange circumstances of these deaths.

16
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:19,947
We need to wipe the silly
superstitions of these people.

17
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,195
Do not worry. You can count
on my help if you need it.

18
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,258
Thank you.

19
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:11,630
Afternoon. This is
the town hall, isn't it?

20
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:13,359
Yes, Miss. It is here.

21
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,059
Good afternoon. You are the new doctor, aren't you? Come in.

22
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:18,185
The mayor awaits you.

23
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:24,589
Mr Rohan, Dr. Materlick and his nurse.

24
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,501
Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

25
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,284
Here is my nomination.

26
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:38,950
Yes I know. You asked for
an energetic Doctor

27
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,120
to fight against superstition in this region.

28
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:46,059
This is precisely why I asked for this place.

29
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:48,264
Miss Erika is my assistant.

30
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,346
Fine.

31
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,798
You will live in the house of Dr. Mersch.

32
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:56,286
Incidentally, in his report sent to
the Ministry of Health,

33
00:06:56,494 --> 00:07:00,604
the Dr. mentioned a disease
that seems to have spread

34
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:04,086
throughout the region for a long time.

35
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:06,408
Could you tell me more about it?

36
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:11,690
I do not know but you should read
Dr Mersch's diary. He noted everything.

37
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,443
Here it is.

38
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,516
I had it in case you asked for it.

39
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:18,590
-Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
-It's nothing.

40
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,273
My name is Christopher Rohan.

41
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,425
-I guess that you want to relax now.
-Yes.

42
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:23,846
I will accompany you.

43
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,661
Do you need anything else?

44
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:38,434
What can you tell me about this 

45
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:40,613
mysterious disease that kills young people?

46
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,661
Oh, don't ask me about this.
They are vampires.

47
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:47,794
Dr. Mersch laughed at me when we
talked about it. He said it was a joke.

48
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:49,483
Vampires don't exist.
But they do.

49
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:52,515
-Well, Ladies. Good night.
-Good night.

50
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:01,998
I can not find scientific explanations for these

51
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:04,959
 cases often repeated on regular periods.

52
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,576
People of the country

53
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:09,850
attribute this terrible
disease to the bite of vampires,

54
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:12,785
blood suckers that are resurrecting on the full moon.

55
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,472
It is an absurd idea

56
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,667
but legends tell that
vampires are cadavers

57
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,999
that can feed on human blood.

58
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,022
They rise in the night.

59
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:29,024
It is also says that vampires can be
killed with a stake through the heart.

60
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:33,557
They can be recognized by the fact that
they are not reflected in a mirror.

61
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:36,022
A cross can stop them.

62
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:41,642
I repeat that these superstitions are unacceptable for 

63
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,769
a man of science like me.

64
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,999
And yet I must admit
that something strange...

65
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,212
Open the door.

66
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,606
Dr. Materlick?

67
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,988
Yes. It's me.

68
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,797
I am the servant of Baron Von Rysselbert.
The Baron is very sick.

69
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,793
Another heart attack.

70
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:04,971
His son sent me to seek you.

71
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,840
I ask you to accompany me.
My car is waiting for you.

72
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:11,584
Baron Von Rysselbert? Erika prepares
the briefcase. Wait a minute.

73
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:18,170
Let's go.

74
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:05,387
She is the housekeeper. She will
lead you to the Baron's room.

75
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,317
Please follow me.

76
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:26,719
Come in.

77
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:30,247
Good evening Dr. Materlick.
I'm Carl Von Rysselbert, the Baron's son.

78
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,713
Tell me, what is wrong with your father?

79
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:36,130
An attack. It happens often.
He suffers from a bad heart.

80
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,480
Coramine.

81
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:02,400
-So Doctor?
-The danger has passed.

82
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,622
Veil him carefully.

83
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:07,441
Please come with me.

84
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,134
How is he?

85
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,008
He had a heart failure but he will
recover soon. Do not worry.

86
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:22,917
Here we are far from civilization.

87
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:25,845
I'm afraid that another attack
could happen again.

88
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:27,691
Can you stay in the castle?

89
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,183
But we left everything we needed at home.

90
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:33,757
Do not worry about it.
Otto will take the nurse to the village

91
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:36,945
and she will get what's necessary.

92
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:39,150
I'm asking you, please.

93
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:42,287
I'm afraid. Afraid to be without
anyone's help in this castle.

94
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,620
My father because of his little fads
removed the telephone

95
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:48,078
and anything that represented progress.

96
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:50,752
It's okay. We will stay.

97
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,243
Thank you very much.
Want something to drink?

98
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,208
No thanks.

99
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,562
The tranquility of having a doctor nearby.

100
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:03,534
You drink a lot?

101
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,977
No, only when I'm nervous.

102
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,720
Here.

103
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,599
It will do you good.

104
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,756
This is curious.

105
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:22,995
These tracks remind me of something
that Dr. Mersch wrote about.

106
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,872
These marks?

107
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:29,033
People say that these are traces of vampires.

108
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,035
But you can see...

109
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,398
I'm still alive.

110
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:35,307
I love, you see,

111
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,557
I love which is impossible.

112
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,572
Which is beyond life.

113
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,507
I love the mystery which is prohibited.

114
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:44,411
If I was Adam

115
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,137
I would not have expected
the temptation of Eve.

116
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:51,089
What is forbidden delights me
because it's an adventure.

117
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:52,746
The real life.

118
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:56,815
Because it enlightens the
terrible night we live in.

119
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,461
This is why...

120
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:02,385
by the full moon...

121
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,843
I feel reborn.

122
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,046
I'm like the others.

123
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,687
But do not pay attention.

124
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:14,607
In this family we're all a little crazy.

125
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:18,038
Doesn't it seem wonderful to you?

126
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:55,044
The castle was built 600 years
ago by the Templars.

127
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,822
Here they celebrated their secret rites.

128
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:02,414
Here they conspired, buried their
treasures and tortured their enemies.

129
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:06,887
Some nights I hear their terrible wailing.

130
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,408
I believe in reincarnation.

131
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:13,898
I understand that this may seem absurd.

132
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:19,683
But I feel as if my ancestor is living in me.

133
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:22,970
I hear the call of the beyond

134
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,409
which makes me reborn.

135
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:28,148
Doctor, your nurse has arrived.

136
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,051
If you don't mind I will
accompany you to your rooms.

137
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,635
Thank you. Good night.

138
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:34,109
Rest well, Doctor.

139
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,545
I'll be on guard, Doctor.

140
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:52,023
Need something?
- No thanks.

141
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,332
Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

142
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,076
Good afternoon.

143
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:22,350
Good afternoon. What do you want?
- I'd like to send a telegram.

144
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,765
You're the new Doctor, aren't you?

145
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,177
-Too bad.
-Too bad?

146
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:34,218
Yes because you're too young and too
pretty to lock yourself in a hole like that.

147
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:35,952
I find this hole very enjoyable.

148
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:38,827
Here blows an unhealthy wind.
Believe me. In your place

149
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:41,613
I'd have left a long time ago.
I wouldn't wait till tomorrow.

150
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:42,435
Why?

151
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:44,117
For health reasons.

152
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,987
How much do I owe you?
- 30 francs.

153
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:51,265
-Good bye.
-Good bye Miss.

154
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:00,187
The doctor said you should take this medicine.

155
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,029
I have not seen her this morning.

156
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:04,438
You know where she is?

157
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,651
She went to the village.

158
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:08,664
She wants to call a specialist
for him to do an analysis.

159
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,252
I feel very well.

160
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:18,281
When I have a crisis like last night
I recover in a few hours.

161
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,786
Know how to play?

162
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,729
-No Mr Baron but I can try.
-We'll see about that.

163
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:32,403
It is very easy.

164
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:33,916
Hold this.

165
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:38,744
You must hit there. You see?
With the cane on the white ball.

166
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,377
Not like that. To the right.

167
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,726
Cane straight to touch the red ball. Ouch!

168
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:49,825
It was almost that.

169
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,985
Hello Miss.

170
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:56,671
I'll take you so you can visit the area around the castle.

171
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,029
Fantastic! If you allow it Mr Baron.

172
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,242
Yes my girl.

173
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:10,934
Do not go near the marshes, Carl.

174
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:16,653
You remind me of a woman
who meant a lot to me.

175
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,089
She is no longer?

176
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,211
Her name's Margaret. She's my cousin.

177
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,611
She went to Switzerland and I haven't heard from her since.

178
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,608
-She was married to another.
-No.

179
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,434
Well, I think not.

180
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,736
Sometimes I see her at night.

181
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:30,204
It's her ghost.

182
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:31,573
She's watching me.

183
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:34,287
-Come. We'll see the marsh
-But your father said ...

184
00:22:34,326 --> 00:22:36,051
Ah, old man's habit!

185
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,230
I do not know why but this marsh attracts me.

186
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:42,452
I come here often just
to contemplate water.

187
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,905
As if a strange influence forced me to.

188
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,243
Look.

189
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,534
Isn't it wonderful?

190
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:08,616
Impressive.

191
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,344
Water is the principle and end of life.

192
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,379
Mistress of death.

193
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,942
Here I kissed Margaret for the first time.

194
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:21,443
It is a magical place.

195
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:29,405
Let's go. Let's flee from here.
I'm afraid.

196
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:30,647
Afraid?

197
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,492
Yes.

198
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,862
Afraid to know that
I'm not like the others.

199
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:36,204
I don't understand.

200
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,858
At the center of the swamp
there is quicksand.

201
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:41,877
When I was a child I saw my horse drown.

202
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:43,428
Drown slowly.

203
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:45,088
Slowly.

204
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:46,798
Slowly.

205
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:50,055
After that I was sick for a long time.

206
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:51,698
I can't...

207
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,904
I can't forget it.

208
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,276
Margaret.

209
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:58,076
You were there!

210
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,040
You've seen her too?

211
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:05,367
Don't leave me.

212
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:06,791
Don't leave me.

213
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:08,491
She's there.

214
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:11,601
Don't you see her?

215
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:12,436
No.

216
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:22,156
Margaret!

217
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,537
Margaret!

218
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:10,650
Margaret!

219
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:12,729
Wait for me!

220
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,202
Margaret.

221
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:41,622
Come on, let's go to the ruins.

222
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:28,709
What happened?

223
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:19,093
Can I enter?

224
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,108
I just got here.
Serve yourself a drink.

225
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,893
I'm a little ahead.

226
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:58,349
I'm pooped. I did not know you had
to run so much to get married.

227
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:02,762
Want some?

228
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:33,671
I gotta go.

229
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,683
You must understand Max.
I do it for her.

230
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:41,131
She has always been very
interested in vampirism.

231
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:45,034
This passion made her seek the
place of doctor in the village.

232
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:48,415
And I think she is in danger.

233
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:50,701
There's few days before the wedding.

234
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:53,964
But of course, you received
a telegram and you go.

235
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,596
And to the fiancé you say
"understand Max"

236
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:58,008
and he understands.

237
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:01,634
Come on darling, you know how much I
love you but I can't leave her alone.

238
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,165
I do not understand.

239
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:06,486
It's not an excuse for postponing the wedding?

240
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:08,732
-You know it's not.
-So what is the reason?

241
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:12,785
When we were students my parents had
the accident that took their lives.

242
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,550
I was broke and couldn't pay for my studies.

243
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:18,478
Then Greta and her family supplied all my needs.

244
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,638
Thanks to her I am now Doctor.

245
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:22,860
If she sends a telegram that says

246
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,576
"come, I need you", I gotta go.
You understand now, Max?

247
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:29,989
She did not put her address.
I'll get it from the town hall.

248
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,532
I won't be long.

249
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:35,063
In the end I have to thank you. I will
have more time to bury my boy's life.

250
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:36,061
Idiot!

251
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,964
I'll take your car. Mine is down.

252
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,275
-Take care of yourself.
-Now go on.

253
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:43,885
I have to change.

254
00:31:57,275 --> 00:32:00,217
With my health problems
I'm not allowed to drink.

255
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,596
But tonight,

256
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,789
if you permit it Doctor,
I'll make an exception.

257
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:08,940
I want you to taste the
brandy that I keep in my cellar.

258
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,923
It is over a 100 years.

259
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:19,166
It is very strong and dangerous
and I am not accustomed to drink.

260
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,945
Don't you think you have to
become a devil first

261
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,250
before trying to become a saint?

262
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:30,487
A great sinner will be able to become a
saint more easily than

263
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,053
the man who's never experienced the pleasures of life.

264
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:36,486
To find true love you must
have loved many times before.

265
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:37,778
Do you understand?

266
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:40,587
I think to know what love is
you only need to love once.

267
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,056
Nice answer

268
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:45,786
and I do not want to remove
your illusions about romanticism.

269
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:47,429
And you Doctor?

270
00:32:47,662 --> 00:32:50,437
Do you share the opinion
of your lovely assistant?

271
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:51,460
Yes.

272
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,392
But I have not loved enough.

273
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,740
I am very interested in my profession.

274
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,138
And that's all.

275
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,944
What do you think of the Brandy?

276
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:04,254
The first impact is amazing and doesn't leave enough time to enjoy it.

277
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:07,126
It's true.

278
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:11,224
Well. One of you dare to get another glass?

279
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:12,280
I do.

280
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:14,636
Otto, serve me another drink.

281
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:19,445
With your permission we will retire.
- Mr Baron must rest and so do we.

282
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:20,992
Good night.

283
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:23,736
We'll have to obey the Doctor.

284
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:12,851
Doctor.

285
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:13,883
Enter.

286
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:17,338
The Baron has had another attack.
I beg you to accompany me.

287
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:18,540
One moment.

288
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:43,842
Calm down, Baron. Calm down.

289
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:45,167
I'm here Doctor.

290
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,624
Give me the briefcase.

291
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:04,157
Come on. Calm down.

292
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:08,989
Coramine.

293
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,811
-How many drops?
-20.

294
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:22,771
You will feel better.

295
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:33,865
Margaret.

296
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:35,678
Margaret.

297
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:37,935
Margaret.

298
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:39,998
Margaret.

299
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:42,067
Margaret.

300
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:54,557
It is not easy for your Doctor friend

301
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:57,510
to face a village full
of superstitious people.

302
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,482
Greta is very brave.

303
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:00,987
Do not worry.

304
00:36:01,183 --> 00:36:03,275
-She knows what she's doing.
-I hope.

305
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,211
She's all alone in this town and

306
00:36:05,315 --> 00:36:07,943
she is counting on your
cooperation as an analyst.

307
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,272
We worked together a long time.

308
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:13,705
Are you married?

309
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:17,034
Why do you ask?

310
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,051
For nothing.

311
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:38,048
I do not want to hide that the
attacks of your father worry me.

312
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:41,783
That night, despite the painkillers,
he was unable to sleep soundly.

313
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:45,895
He is obsessed with a name
that he repeats endlessly.

314
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:47,440
Margaret.

315
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:49,422
You know who this is?

316
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:51,175
Yes. My cousin.

317
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,904
She disappeared.

318
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:57,133
It's been said that she left for Switzerland but we never learned anything.

319
00:36:57,405 --> 00:36:59,596
My father loved her above all else.

320
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:01,871
Perhaps more than me.

321
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:06,793
This coat of arms, what does it mean?

322
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:08,852
These are the arms of the family.

323
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:11,325
This grid is no longer used?

324
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,650
Of course not.

325
00:37:22,636 --> 00:37:23,690
Nice castle.

326
00:37:23,972 --> 00:37:27,039
According to the legend it was
built over 600 years ago.

327
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:29,719
Hello Otto.

328
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:32,028
-Good afternoon.
-We come to see the Doctor.

329
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:33,468
Go please.

330
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,400
Good afternoon.

331
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:47,213
-Hello, Carl.
-How are you?

332
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:49,507
-Doctor.
-Good afternoon.

333
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:53,128
Carl, this is my friend.
Doctor Nell.

334
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,335
Son of the Baron.

335
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:57,500
Enchanted and welcome.
Do you want to have something?

336
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,555
Thank you. We had lunch on the way.

337
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,321
Let us have at least the honor of
accepting our hospitality at the castle.

338
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,387
Thank you, I accept with pleasure.

339
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,798
This way I can chat with Dr. Materlick.

340
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,824
Incidentally, Mr Mayor, can
I speak with you a moment?

341
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:11,582
Whenever you want.

342
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:15,511
-Doctor. Please.
-Thank you.

343
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:20,905
I have good news.

344
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,514
The material you requested is finally here.

345
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:26,916
I am grateful to you, Mr Rohan.
So now I can open the clinic.

346
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,681
The arrival of Dr. Nell is providential.

347
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:33,198
I am ready to fight with
all my strength against

348
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:36,663
this strange anemia Dr.
Mersch speaks of in his diary.

349
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:39,623
Tonight is the full moon

350
00:38:40,629 --> 00:38:41,829
and it seems

351
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,750
that it is at that moment
that the disease wakes up.

352
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:46,419
This is something weird and

353
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:49,863
bordering on superstition that I
would like to see definitely destroyed.

354
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:54,089
Despite the passing of time, people continue to believe in vampires.

355
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,790
And you Mr Rohan?

356
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,663
Do you believe they exist?

357
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:00,193
A grown man can not believe in them

358
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:02,040
but despite that

359
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,378
I put a lock on my door at night.

360
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:12,535
The lover knocked at the door of his beloved.

361
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,145
She asked: Who is it?

362
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,867
He answered: It's me.

363
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:17,505
She did not open the door

364
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:21,444
and despairing he knocked again and
to the question "Who is this?"

365
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:23,883
he replied: I am you.
Then the door opened.

366
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,918
I wouldn't have opened the door.

367
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,292
Because if it was really
the lover who knocked

368
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:30,535
he would only say: you.

369
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:32,948
Forgetting himself.

370
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,243
You're too subtle Erica.

371
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,257
Upon your arrival at the castle,

372
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,471
as soon as I saw you, I knew
no one and nothing could separate us.

373
00:39:41,557 --> 00:39:43,722
And yet we are still separated.

374
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:44,557
Why?

375
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:48,522
I feel the anguish of not
being free, my hands are chained.

376
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:55,017
Erica, I want you to
understand me, I'm sick.

377
00:39:55,604 --> 00:40:00,509
For all my love that goes beyond life
I beg you to leave the castle.

378
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:13,343
Do not wait. Not even until the night.

379
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,911
Erica you're crazy, crazier than me.

380
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:25,257
Run away from me.
I can cause you a lot of trouble.

381
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:32,835
Forgive me.

382
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:58,864
The Baron had an accident and since
then nobody has seen his cousin.

383
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,739
He said she studies in Switzerland.

384
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,402
It is all fascinating.

385
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,724
Here is Dr Mersch's diary.

386
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,928
Read it. It confirms my suspicions.

387
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:17,007
Mr Baron asks you to forgivee him,
he will not come to dinner.

388
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,446
-And Mr. Carl?
-He had to leave.

389
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,551
Ask Mr Baron if I can go
to see him after dinner.

390
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:25,160
-I have to do an analysis.
-Very well Miss.

391
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:32,907
How interesting. Dr. Mersch
insinuates the existence of vampires.

392
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:36,285
Almost, almost...
He had to be a very imaginative man.

393
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:32,133
Come in.

394
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:36,275
Excuse me Mr Baron.
I just neeed to get a blood test.

395
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:45,717
Good.

396
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,709
It will not be long.

397
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:51,717
I will do you no harm.

398
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:55,122
Your arm.

399
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:56,680
Bend it.

400
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:00,580
Clench the fist please.

401
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:05,035
That's it.

402
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,961
You will feel just a little bite.

403
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:20,375
-So? It hurt you?
-No.

404
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,067
What's going on?

405
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,849
Greta I'm very scared.
I heard a terrible cry.

406
00:46:09,927 --> 00:46:13,058
So did I. Everything that happens
in this castle is very strange.

407
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,544
Let's see what it is.

408
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:21,418
The housekeeper is trying to hide something.

409
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:23,642
I assure you it was not
the Baron who screamed like that.

410
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,531
I'm going to my room and locking myself in.

411
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:31,312
When the analysis is finished I will
leave and try to forget this castle forever.

412
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:32,472
Speak lower.

413
00:46:50,243 --> 00:46:51,939
Erica...

414
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:15,820
Erica...

415
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:58,670
Something wrong Miss?

416
00:51:00,353 --> 00:51:01,044
No.

417
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,488
I thought I heard women laughing.

418
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,253
I was looking for my nurse who is not in her room.

419
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,101
She has probably gone
for a walk with Mr Carl.

420
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:13,214
The night is beautiful.

421
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,510
Margaret...

422
00:55:19,932 --> 00:55:23,493
Erica...

423
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:28,515
Margaret...

424
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:33,758
Erica...

425
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:40,175
Come in.

426
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,266
Hello Mr Rohan.

427
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:46,214
Hello Brenda.

428
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:49,423
I allowed myself to call
you to ask a favor.

429
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,057
I know you and Marisa grew up together.

430
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,105
You were very friendly.

431
00:55:54,757 --> 00:55:58,324
After what happened Marisa is in shock.

432
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,685
She should not be left alone.

433
00:56:00,797 --> 00:56:04,201
As she has no parents, I thought you ...

434
00:56:04,344 --> 00:56:07,057
Do not worry Mr Rohan. I will keep her company.

435
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:08,754
I know what she must feel.

436
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:11,088
She was married for a short time.

437
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,307
Thank you.

438
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:15,471
I'm happy to help her. Tell me Mr Rohan.

439
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:18,680
Is it true her neck had vampire bites?

440
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:22,018
Nonsense! People's superstitions!

441
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:24,014
Vampires do not exist.

442
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:26,597
It is true her neck had bites, but

443
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:30,353
her body lay all night in the countryside. It could've been any animal.

444
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:32,609
But people say ...

445
00:56:32,752 --> 00:56:34,487
Yet these are superstitions!

446
00:56:34,852 --> 00:56:37,357
Don't tell me that you also believe in vampires.

447
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:42,405
You know Mr Mayor, Dr. Mersch said the same. And the truth is that ...

448
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,805
Alright, alright, forget it ...

449
00:56:45,078 --> 00:56:47,296
If you no longer need me ...

450
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:48,717
No thank you.

451
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:51,391
Rest easy. I'm going straight to her house.

452
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:53,439
-Good.
-Good day Mr Mayor.

453
00:57:17,399 --> 00:57:18,899
You should go to sleep.

454
00:57:19,734 --> 00:57:22,591
I will help you to do everything I can.

455
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:30,013
Why's he taking so long?

456
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:33,744
He always goes outside to walk
and leaves me alone.

457
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:36,992
I sing, I sing because I'm scared.

458
00:57:37,657 --> 00:57:40,292
You have nothing to fear.
I'm with you.

459
00:57:40,814 --> 00:57:42,784
As at the internship.
Do you remember?

460
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:46,436
We shared the same room together.
We shared everything everywhere.

461
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:49,039
After that you got married

462
00:57:49,078 --> 00:57:52,170
and we no longer saw each other. Now it will be as before.

463
00:57:52,528 --> 00:57:54,034
I'll take care of you.

464
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:56,976
Soon you will forget everything.
Well, go to sleep now.

465
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:01,358
I'll see you again soon.

466
00:59:32,952 --> 00:59:34,393
Do not cry my child.

467
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:36,675
Your mother will never fail you.

468
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:05,961
He's there.

469
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:08,361
He must not leave the castles domain.

470
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:49,917
He's gone. He'll return
only if the moon's hiding.

471
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:53,699
This is horrible. The poor people
who will fall under his hand.

472
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,051
He must be here.

473
01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:42,562
Carl!

474
01:05:50,323 --> 01:05:51,757
There! He's there!

475
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,135
Miss Erica is not in her room.

476
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,496
And Mr. Carl? Where is he?

477
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:15,580
He sleeps. He went outside last
night and returned very late.

478
01:07:16,826 --> 01:07:19,108
Erica probably went down to the village.

479
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,739
Without telling me?

480
01:07:21,013 --> 01:07:23,086
Believe me. I'm very worried.

481
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:24,469
We must search for her.

482
01:07:24,535 --> 01:07:26,739
She wouldn't leave without saying anything.

483
01:07:58,331 --> 01:07:59,211
Brenda?

484
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,566
He's coming.

485
01:08:15,002 --> 01:08:18,002
What's wrong with you Brenda?
Please tell me.

486
01:08:18,249 --> 01:08:19,273
He's coming.

487
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:20,910
I feel it.

488
01:08:21,132 --> 01:08:22,449
He approaches.

489
01:08:22,893 --> 01:08:24,393
He approaches.

490
01:08:27,823 --> 01:08:28,723
Brenda?

491
01:08:35,226 --> 01:08:38,226
He's coming. I feel it.

492
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:40,181
He approaches.

493
01:08:41,545 --> 01:08:42,928
He approaches.

494
01:08:44,493 --> 01:08:46,788
He's coming. He's coming.

495
01:08:56,179 --> 01:08:58,723
Wait a moment please.
I'll talk with the mayor.

496
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:12,105
Sorry Mr Mayor.
Dr. Materlick wants to talk to you.

497
01:09:12,223 --> 01:09:13,553
Tell her to enter.

498
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,923
Good morning.

499
01:09:21,249 --> 01:09:22,644
Sorry to bother you

500
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,484
but I am very concerned.

501
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,214
My assistant Miss Rosenberg has
disappeared from the castle.

502
01:09:28,527 --> 01:09:30,275
Nobody's seen her since last night.

503
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:35,388
In addition, Brenda, our nurse
is having a nervous breakdown.

504
01:09:35,688 --> 01:09:39,366
And most disturbing is that she has
traces of a bite that looks...

505
01:09:39,615 --> 01:09:40,788
Like a vampire?

506
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,249
Please Doctor.

507
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:45,158
You are really nervous.
Tonight I will go to the castle.

508
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,687
Your nurse will certainly be back.

509
01:09:48,052 --> 01:09:51,131
The only danger is if she
approaches the swamp.

510
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:56,048
There's quicksand there and she would not be the first victim. But I don't think so.

511
01:10:02,009 --> 01:10:04,892
I do not know what happened to Erica.
I looked all over the house.

512
01:10:05,048 --> 01:10:07,135
You think it's possible
she changed into a vampire?

513
01:10:07,318 --> 01:10:09,248
We must find her quickly.

514
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:13,017
What worries me is that the butler told me
that they went out together last night.

515
01:10:13,369 --> 01:10:14,687
I'm afraid for her.

516
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:16,707
I think Carl knows where she is.

517
01:10:16,773 --> 01:10:19,538
-You didn't tell me they were together?
-But it is precisely for that reason.

518
01:10:19,643 --> 01:10:21,234
Carl is a psychopath.

519
01:10:21,743 --> 01:10:23,471
You're making me afraid Greta.

520
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,139
We will form groups.

521
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:38,517
This girl could get lost in the
ruins of the monastery or in the marsh.

522
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,282
Carl, you know very well
the ruins, go ahead.

523
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,095
-I'll go with Carl.
-I'll go to the marshes.

524
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,386
I'm going with you.

525
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:45,547
Good luck.

526
01:10:47,881 --> 01:10:50,634
Otto, do not lose sight of Carl.

527
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:05,026
I heard that you didn't spend the night in the castle.

528
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:07,922
Without being indiscreet, can
you tell me where you were?

529
01:11:08,072 --> 01:11:10,225
Yesterday? Yes, I was in town.

530
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:13,668
Erica, my nurse, went out
with you some nights.

531
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:17,079
-You didn't see her last night?
-No, that's why we're trying to find her.

532
01:11:17,178 --> 01:11:19,884
I do not understand why you're asking me this question.

533
01:11:20,595 --> 01:11:24,390
I love Erica and I am
concerned about her fate.

534
01:11:25,069 --> 01:11:27,104
This morning I was in the village.

535
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:32,360
Brenda was unconscious and spoke in dreamy hallucinated words.

536
01:11:32,908 --> 01:11:33,840
Besides

537
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:36,534
she had on her neck the same mark as you.

538
01:11:38,555 --> 01:11:40,512
Tonight is the full moon.

539
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:42,599
You're not afraid to be alone with me?

540
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:44,672
Your skin may tempt a vampire.

541
01:11:44,985 --> 01:11:47,451
Dear Carl, I do not believe in vampires.

542
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,904
I believe in psychopaths and killers.

543
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:52,456
You accuse me?

544
01:11:55,975 --> 01:11:59,630
Look. There are the ruins.
We'd better split up.

545
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,789
Yes Carl. As you wish.

546
01:13:30,492 --> 01:13:32,555
You're going to stay
here and do nothing?

547
01:13:32,644 --> 01:13:33,285
No.

548
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:35,742
I am nervous about this.

549
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:42,198
I believe that this is the end.

550
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:45,573
We tried to hide Margaret
for several years.

551
01:13:45,737 --> 01:13:50,547
She was bitten. She turned into a monster
and she also destroyed your son Carl.

552
01:13:50,921 --> 01:13:54,345
This night of full moon
nothing can hold them back.

553
01:13:54,557 --> 01:13:59,253
On our conscience weighs the victims
who fall between their claws.

554
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:03,541
Dr. Mersch foresaw it all. That's
why you have caused the accident

555
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:06,753
that cost him his life.
And now Dr. Materlick risks the same fate.

556
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:12,199
I can not stay like this.
I will confess everything to the mayor.

557
01:14:12,363 --> 01:14:14,793
Shut up! Shut up!

558
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:19,635
You will not tell anyone. You cannot
reveal what happens in this castle.

559
01:14:19,847 --> 01:14:21,428
This is our secret.

560
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:24,151
Your son Carl?
What're you going to do with him?

561
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:27,265
Lock him up and never let him out.
Never.

562
01:14:27,983 --> 01:14:29,206
You're mad!

563
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:03,232
You hurt?

564
01:15:03,363 --> 01:15:05,173
-No. It's nothing.
-You sure?

565
01:15:05,271 --> 01:15:06,314
Let's go.

566
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:36,498
Erica!

567
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:54,911
Erica back!

568
01:17:55,264 --> 01:17:58,498
Erica don't go! At the bottom
of the marsh there's quicksand.

569
01:24:46,325 --> 01:24:47,503
The poor woman!

570
01:24:48,004 --> 01:24:50,320
The emotion was too strong.

571
01:24:51,298 --> 01:24:56,385
Nobody can now say that the suspicions of Dr. Mersch were proven. She went crazy.

572
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:01,916
Hurry up please.

573
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:17,172
