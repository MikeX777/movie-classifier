00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:02,042
Greetings, sir.

11
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,833
The Government will not take action
against the wish of the people.

12
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,458
- Sir, K3 police station.
- That was said by the Prime minister.

13
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,667
At Madurai airport,
he met the press reporters...

14
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,833
... and said he will appeal
to the supreme Court.

15
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,792
- Greetings, sir.

16
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,417

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,458
Hey, get up.

18
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,917
Sir, I didn't do any mistake.
Tell them to leave me.

19
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,708
(Indistinct chatters)

20
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:41,167
(Indistinct chatters)

21
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:55,458
Sir has gone out for rounds.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,542
Don’t know why, the Inspector asked us
to come urgently.

23
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,375
Did he tell anything?

24
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,375
No, sir. We enquired him our best.
But, he didn’t say anything.

25
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,125
Okay,
Get me his FIR, immediately.

26
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,375
Sir, it’s Aminjikarai, K3 police station.
Sir just came in.

27
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:21,958
"Honour killings" often takes place
in the villages...

28
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,458
The accused, himself came
and surrendered, sir.

29
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,667
We have sent the corpse to autopsy.

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,500
Okay, sir.

31
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,083
Okay, I’ll inform, sir.

32
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:34,125
Right now, we’re at Aminjikarai,
the murder spot.

33
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,583
We will ask the people
who have witnessed the murder.

34
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,625
I was tying the flowers there.

35
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,833
The man who is dead,
was coming by the side.

36
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:48,167
A guy came in high speed and lynched him.
He fell down unconsciously.

37
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,833
Heeding loud noise, I came out
and saw, what it was?

38
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,750
Don’t know what was the issue.

39
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,250
A person was lynching another person.

40
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,625
Have you seen the murderer
anywhere before?

41
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,625
No, I haven’t seen him before.

42
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,458
Didn't anyone stop,
when the incident happened?

43
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,667
He is lynching with a knife.

44
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,042
You’re asking, didn't we stop.

45
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,208
What would you do?
Will you stop him?

46
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:34,917
The news we received so far,
the murder has surrendered in the police station.

47
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,917

to find about the deceased.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,875

Thank you, Prabhu.

50
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,292
The current news...

51
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:49,792
Police suspects this murder would’ve been
executed because of illegal affair.

52
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,625
The brawl between the murderer
and the deceased…

53
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,917
…was the reason for the murder,
said by the local residents.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,750

Let the passengers get down soon.

87
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,333

00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,083
Hello, boss!

92
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,417
Guindy has arrived, you may get down.

93
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,833
Brother, this will not go to Vadapalani,

94
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,458

and then reaches Koyambedu.

- Those who have to get down at Guindy, get down.

Sir, come I’ll take you.
- Sir, come on.

101
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,125
Where do you want to go?
Auto is ready.

102
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,167
Sir, come let’s go.

103
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,625

Sir, come.
Come, sit here.

109
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,625
We’re not going by auto.
We’re going by bus.

110
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,542
While leaving, I was cautioned
that auto guys will pester.

111
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,583
- Are you going by bus?

112
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,375
It’s right.

113
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,708
Hey, you don’t have bus
at this hour.

114
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,000
You’ve to go only by auto.

115
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:50,750
Wait and see.

116
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,250
I’m also watching you
for past one year.

117
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:55,167
You came by cycle, then a moped,
now by bike.

118
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,542
Don’t you see the auto is parked,
coming in between and taking the ride.

119
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,583
- Hey, move away.
- You will become a big shot, in future.

120
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,333
- Brother, do you need an auto?
- Hey, uncle.

121
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,250
It’s my ride.

122
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,292
Come!

123
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,333
Wow, it’s Audi A4!

124
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:14,333
Wow, what a car!

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Kathir!

126
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,708
Hey!

127
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,333
Hey, don’t you have sense?

128
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,625
Have you informed your home?

129
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,542
I didn’t say, sir.

130
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,667
Dare to give a mocking reply.

131
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,625
Where have you to go?

132
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,542
To Choolaimedu.

133
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,417

134
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,292
- Someone drop them and come.

135
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,208

- Every day, these kind of nuisance arrives.
- Hey, come on.

137
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,000
What to do?
Come on.

138
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,375
Sir, you didn't turn on the meter.

139
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,000
- No, I haven’t.

140
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:06,583
You need to go to Choolaimedu, right?

00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:18,208
For earning 100 or 150 rupees,
are we awake the whole night and driving auto?

146
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:21,292
It’s 300 rupees,

00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,792
Come.

177
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,625
Shanmugam brother!

178
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,333
This is the house.

179
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,500
Come Mari, are they the one
you spoke about?

180
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,375
Yes.
Open the door.

181
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,625
- Come in.
- Come.

182
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,875
Mari, I too observe,
the people who you bring...

183
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:59,583
...stay for two to three days
as if they stay in lodge and leave.

184
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,583
Will these people stay
for some days?

185
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,625
Brother, will everyone who come here
will like the house?

186
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,208
If they like, then they will stay.

187
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,042
Have I ever kept balance on rent
or advance?

188
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,708
- No, I can’t blame you on payments.
- Then, open it.

189
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,167
Get inside.

190
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,875
Mari!

191
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,333
Water crisis is here.
Have you informed them?

192
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,583
I’ve informed everything
and brought them here.

193
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,208
I’m feeling sleepy,
going to take rest.

194
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,083
- You go.
- Okay.

195
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,625
Close the gate and leave.

196
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

197
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,042
Do you like the house?

198
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,542
All your required things
will reach you tomorrow morning.

199
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,875
This is the safest place.

200
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,750
No one can easily identify this place
and come here.

201
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,292
Don’t think and worry about anything.

202
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,708
Be happy.

203
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,125
Enjoy.

204
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,042
Malar!

205
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,167
Kathir!

206
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:22,750
Hey.

207
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,917
If I tell you one thing,
you shouldn’t feel bad.

208
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,833
Kathir!

209
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,125
If a girl elopes from a house,
they say the girl is strayed.

210
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,292
Her name will never change till
she proves herself by living happily.

211
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:43,042
You go for a job
and earn money.

212
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:47,792
When we both return to our village,
people should respect us by looking at our stature.

213
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,792
After achieving,
we can have this…

214
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,500
Sorry, Kathir.

215
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,625
Are you angry?

216
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,542
Kathir!

217
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,208
Okay.

218
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:19,667
Sir.

219
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,667
Tell me.

220
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,458
-Where have you sent the boy and girl?
- Sir, I didn’t send them.

221
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,917
- Tell me.
- Sir, I don’t know.

222
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,917
Why did you brought up the girl
so chubby?

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,792
To mesmerize the rich guys like us, right?

224
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,625
- Sir, not like that.
- How much money do you need?

225
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,583
- Sir, don’t speak bad.
- Tell me, where they’re?

226
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,875
- I’ll give you the money.
- Sir, I didn’t bring up my daughter immoral.

227
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:36,625
Tell me.

228
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,583
Sir, you’ve mistaken.
- I’ll kill you.

229
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,250
Hey!
- Sir.

230
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,875
Hey, take off your legs.

231
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,000
Take off your legs.

232
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,625
How dare each one of you
is coming home and hitting him?

233
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,208
If your son has eloped with her,
either leave them or kill them.

234
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:55,292
Instead coming and creating ruckus here,
is not right.

235
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,708
Leave now.
- Hey, if it’s your daughter, will you tell this?

236
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,875
Be quite, all these ruckus
is because of you.

237
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,917
If you had nurtured your daughter perfectly,
will anyone come and question us?

238
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,375
Hey, get lost from here.

239
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,000
If I give a signal,
the entire colony will come and kill you.

240
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,333
Brother, they might come.
Come, let’s go.

241
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,042
Or else I’ll lodge complaint
in the police station.

242
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,375
Don’t stand here, leave now.

243
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:13,500
Get up.
Hey, you get up.

244
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,917
Hereafter if you favour her,
I’ll hit you to death.

245
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,125
Then you have to go,
where you first wife has left.

246
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,792
Being second wife to you, rather I should’ve died.
My children are suffering.

247
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,583
Dude, I don’t know what will you do.

248
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,167
You kill her and bring back my son.

249
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,125
This is a bad name for our ancestry.

250
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,917
We should get rid from the root.

251
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,542
Tell me.

252
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,042
I’ll tell you.
They have gone to Chennai.

253
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,667
Where in Chennai?

254
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,375
At Choolaimedu.

255
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,708
- I don’t know anything more.
- Choolaimedu!

256
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,125
Hey, let’s start to Chennai.

257
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,000
Kathir!

258
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Kathir!

259
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,417
How long to knock the door!

260
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,417
Hey, this is not like your village.

261
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,875
The water container has arrived,
go and fetch the water.

262
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,417
Use well water only for household.

263
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,958
Hey, you bath and do washing near the well
and throw covers inside the well.

264
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,958
Don’t know what to say about you all!

265
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,417
Hey!

266
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:29,958
Wow, Yamaha RX 135!

267
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,458
Hey!

268
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,625
Hey, Kathir!
Come on.

269
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,375
Not leaving a car or bike.

270
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,042
Looks like the crowd in “Alagar” river!

271
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,958
How to fetch water in this crowd?

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,750
Sister, I’ll take one pot of water.

273
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:45,750
Malar!

274
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,792
- Stop.
- Go away.

275
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,708
You fetch the water.

276
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,458
Hey, are you calling him for support?

277
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,083
We’re all waiting for one pot water only.
- Sister, I've come from outstation.

278
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,250
So, you've come from outstation
to fetch water?

279
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,542
I'm residing in this street.

280
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,958
(Indistinct chatters)

281
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:10,917
Hey, no!

282
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,750
You made me to get caught
and laughing now?

283
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,875
I said, don't hit me.

284
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,708
You said, you'll take care of
me like a queen.

285
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,042
Now, you let me to fetch water.

286
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,083
You're also the same
like any other male.

287
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,167
Fraud.

288
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,583
Henceforth, you must go to bring water.

289
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,167
I'll not come.

290
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,292
Won't you switch on the motor, on time?

291
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,083
- Who's turn is this week?
- It's mine, Anbu.

292
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,042
- Then, you'd have switched it on.
- I had work the whole night.

293
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,500
Go and switch on the motor.

294
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:47,167
Shantha, why didn't you like Ramu?

295
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,667
Shanta, why didn't you like Balu?

296
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,250
Ramu and Balu is confusing.

297
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,125
Today, I should astonish him
by my acting.

298
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,417
Dude!

299
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,833
- I'm coming.
- Dude!

300
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,625
Welcome, uncle.

301
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,708
Dude, I've got a furious chance
to showcase my acting.

302
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,583
You say like a starving dog
got a dosa.

303
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,458
I was called for an audition
for a new film.

304
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,250
Known I'm addicted to lentil snacks,
you're going to pressurise me...

305
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,750
...and prove your talent, isn't it?

306
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:14,667
God bless you.

307
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,667
Arya is the hero.

308
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,792
It's a friend character.

309
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,042
- Friend of Arya's father?
- No, a friend to Arya.

310
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,625
To Arya?

311
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,625
Shall I act?

312
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,417
Jaishankar, sir!

313
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,000
What's lacking in my friend?

314
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:30,042
Doesn't he have knowledge,
charm, tone and good thoughts?

315
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,292
Just wait, don't be panic.

316
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,833
You might pop up in emotion.

317
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:33,792
Just wait,

318
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,542
Dude, is Arya acting in
any period film, recently?

319
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,542
No, it's a college story.

320
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,792
- College film?
- I'm studying in college with Arya.

321
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,125
Arya is in love with Shantha.

322
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,208
I'm helping him in his love.

323
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,167
Shantha has become old, Samantha was also
outdated and she left to Andhra.

324
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,958
You're shouting as 'Shantha' now.

325
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:55,833
Hey, oldey!

326
00:20:55,875 --> 00:21:00,125
First, get rid of these
old style costumes and accessories.

327
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,083
Let's see whether you can
do better in acting.

328
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,292
If I wear all these, people respect
me, 'the Square star'.

329
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,458
Who gave you the title, 'Square star'?

330
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,458
It's me.

331
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:09,667
Who is giving to whom?

332
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,708
Everyone is titling themselves.

333
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,917
So, I preferred this title myself.

334
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,875
Don't you feel ashame?

335
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,125
If I feel shame,
I can't get an Oscar, dude.

336
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,708
First, go and see your family in Arcot.

337
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,583
Instead, he is going to America
to get an Oscar.

338
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:28,500
Look here, I'll get two Oscars and
appear before you, who teased my acting.

339
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:32,875
On that day, we both will
hang and die.

340
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,042
Go.

341
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,000
Do you feel jealous of this film?

342
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,000
Next film is with Director Shankar...
- Why do you tease him?

343
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,125
He is pityful.

344
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,375
He has become mad on cinema.

345
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,000
Kathir!

346
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,250
Kathir, get up.

347
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,708
Mom, let me sleep.

348
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,708
Where am I?

349
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,625
Malar!

350
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:37,542
Is it 11 o'clock?

351
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,625
Malar, don't cry.
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:51,292
In sleep, I thought I'm in home
and my mother is waking me up...

353
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,792
I'm hungry, Kathir.

354
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll get you now.

355
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,917
Just five minutes.
I'll get you.

356
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,208
He bought us lentil snacks and
shown his acting, irritating to the core.

357
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,292
Hey!

358
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:05,875
Who is he?

359
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,792
Driving like he didn't have RC.

360
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:11,625
Didn't I tell you, I took a ride with
a couple in love?

361
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,208
- Yes.
- That's him.

362
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,750
Is it him?

363
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,917
Arumugam brother, who is this guy?

364
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:22,167
He is the new tenant next
to your house.

365
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,500
Brother, it's long time
since I asked for idly.

366
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,625
Take the idlis soon.

367
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,500
- Just wait for five minutes.
- Okay, sir.

368
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:44,917
- 'Come on, my dear village girl'
- You'll be banged with broomstick.

369
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:45,958
Brother, two tea.

370
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,208
Two tea.

371
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,542
- Wash the glass well with water.
- He is my neighbour.

372
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,625
He is sitting here.

373
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,292
He looks like a rogue.

374
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,875
Why is he running?

375
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:32,875
Do you want auto?

376
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,083
- Give me.
- Here it is.

377
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,000
Have you seen him anywhere?

378
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,917
- Hey, I knew him.
- Where did you see him?

379
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,667
He came in my auto
along with a girl.

380
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,750
I dropped them at Burma bazaar.

381
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,083
Where is Burma bazaar?

382
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,958
Do you've Google map, brother?

383
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,000
Burma bazaar.

384
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,208
Where the blue line ends
is Burma bazaar.

385
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,208
- I dropped them there.
- Come, let's go.

386
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,750
I'm from Melur, Madurai.

387
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,625
She is from my neighbouring village.

388
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,917
We both studied in the same college.

389
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:13,833
We fell in love.

390
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,625
It came to my father's knowledge.

391
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:21,958
We belong to different caste.
She is from lower caste.

392
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,750
My father didn't like it.

393
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,333
He blazed her along with her family.

394
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,792
It's a great thing, she survived.

395
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,708
I don't know what to do.

396
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,333
That's why, I tied her nuptial knot
in the temple and brought her here.

397
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,750
Who is he who came now?

398
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,958
He is my maternal uncle.

399
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,708
My mother's brother.

400
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,125
They have known this place.

401
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,083
If caught, they will not do
me anything.

402
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,625
But, they will kill that girl.

403
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,708
We can't stay here, anymore.

404
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,250
We will vacate the house and go.

405
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,667
Brother, I spoke with my friend
regarding the job.

406
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,958
Hey, stop blabbering.

407
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,083
If you want to go...
Where will you go?

408
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,375
Did you say only the area
or given the address too?

409
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,750
I told only the area, brother.

410
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:17,750
That's why, they have come here
in search of you.

411
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:20,083
You eloped from the hometown
and hiding here.

412
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,792
For what sake, did you call him?

413
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,958
Instead of this life, it's better to...

414
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,000
Don't know who all will
come, searching.

415
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,458
Should I suffer because of you?

416
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,875
Accompanied by a girl,

417
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:32,625
He is saying to leave...

418
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,667
Why are you afraid?

419
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:39,292
If they don't find the person
in a area, they won't come here again.

420
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,583
Don't be afraid.

421
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,792
I'll take care.

422
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,083
Will you give me a tea?

423
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,833
There is no milk.

424
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,375
It's our house.

425
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,292
I can have whenever I want.

426
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,958
I'll come often.

427
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,250
Hey!

428
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,083
They won't come, hereafter.

429
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,250
I'll take care.

430
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:00,458
Be bold.

431
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,708
Take care of her safe.

432
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,708
Shall I leave?
Bye.

433
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:11,708
Brother, it seems he
will take her.

434
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,458
It'll not work, right?

435
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,083
I've contact with all the
colleges in Tamil Nadu.

436
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:17,917
Yes.

437
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:20,542
Whoever elopes with the girl,
I'll get the call, first.

438
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,917
Yes, that's routine.

439
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,792
But, they will come and enjoy
for two days and abandon the girl.

440
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,625
- Then, I'll take over the girl.
- Yes.

441
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:31,083
- But, he is in deep love on this girl.
- Is it?

442
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,458
That's why, going beyond a week.

443
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,583
He will leave.

444
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:16,583
Malar.

445
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:19,625
Get up.

446
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,208
What?

447
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,458
What?
Are you surprised?

448
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,625
I'll give you surprise
every year, like this.

449
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,333
This is a big surprise to me.

450
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:53,917
My birth date is today
but my birthday is on next month.

451
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,625
Sister, please wait.

452
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,375
- I'll go to ATM.
- Okay, go.

453
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,875
Dude, shall we have a tea?

454
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,208
I'll buy you.

455
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,042
Hey, come on.

456
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,375
Master, two cups of strong tea.

457
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:39,958
- Two cups of tea.

458
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,667
She is very stingy.

459
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:44,083
Why is she buying me tea?

460
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,125
Let me see how long it goes.

461
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:49,750
Dude, your shirt is excellent.

462
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:53,042
I bought it four years ago
and washed four days ago.

463
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,833
You're the first woman to say
that khaki shirt is looking excellent.

464
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,250
You want to ask me something.

465
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,625
Instead of going around,
ask me straight away.

466
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,458
Saying this and that...

467
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,583
Dude, I saw Anbu at
Saidapet sub- jail, a few times.

468
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,208
The lawyer comes to the auto stand
and takes money from him.

469
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,708
What's his problem?

470
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,792
I was dubious on you.

471
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:18,333
You look after your job,
don't poke unnecessarily in other things.

472
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:22,208
If so, I'll bang you.

473
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,542
Do you know how happily
that family lived?

474
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:42,542
You can't find a person like his father,
wherever you search in this world.

475
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:47,042
If anyone see the love in his family,
they would feel jealous.

476
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,583
Are you good?

477
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,292
Mani, come on.

478
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,250
Why have you come here?

479
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:54,583
I went to your house,
sister said you are here.

480
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,875
That's why, I came here.

481
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,458
Manickam, give the invitation to him.

482
00:30:58,542 --> 00:30:59,750
- Take it, brother-in-law.
- Is it your daughter's wedding?

483
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:00,708
Yes, come along with your family.

484
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,958
You must come two days before.

485
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:03,292
What are you doing, dude?

486
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,708
I'm studying B.Sc., Agriculture, final year.

487
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:06,958
- Okay, dude.
- What, Mani?

488
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,375
Names of kin isn't mentioned.

489
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,625
They are staying away from
the family for five years.

490
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:11,833
Are they staying away or
you kept them away,

491
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,458
...since they aren't rich?

492
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,417
You've kept them away,
that's the fact, right?

493
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,208
Five hundred houses are there
in our village.

494
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:19,875
Fifty houses belong to our clan.

495
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:23,333
Though we belong to upper caste,
we are a small clan.

496
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,458
We should be like the goats
in the shed.

497
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:28,000
If a kid is missed in the shed,
the wolf will kill it.

Greetings to all!

- Greetings!
- Welcome!

520
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,625
- Are you all good?
- We are good.

521
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:07,375
- Take this.
- Thank you.

522
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,708
Parasu, I want to talk with you.

523
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,958
An auspicious occasion is going on,

524
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,583
I wish to talk about an alliance.

525
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,750
Your daughter and my son
is studying in the same college.

526
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:21,250
Though you were low
in status than me,

527
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,833
...my son likes your daughter.

528
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,958
What to do?

529
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:28,625
So, you discuss in your home
and tell me a good decision.

530
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,917
I'm happy that you attended
this occasion.

531
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:36,917
You can leave.

532
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:39,875
I'm telling you to leave.

533
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,625
- Whom are you talking?
- Hey!

534
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,792
Brother-in-law, he is a MLA.
He is asking for a bride.

535
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:51,583
Though there is difference in
the caste, it's a wealthy family, right?

536
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,250
Hey!

537
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,292
He is MLA!
His grandfather came to our backyard.

538
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,083
His father came to the entrance
of our house.

539
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,083
He wants to sleep in my house.

540
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,500
Is it enough if he has
money and power?

541
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:01,500
Shouldn't he have a stature of dignity?

542
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,500
He has come to ask my daughter.

543
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,333
Hey, Uma!

544
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,000
What, brother?

545
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,208
Will you accept your son
to marry my daughter?

546
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,250
Why are you asking this, brother?

547
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:07,542
Hey, do you like my daughter?

548
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:08,417
Yes, uncle.

549
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,167
Your wedding is on next auspicious day.

550
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,792
Hey! Stop.

551
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,417
How long to wait?

552
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,042
When my head honcho came
and asked for bride,

553
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,917
...your father has denied him.

554
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,875
We are poor too.

555
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,333
When your father denied him,
Will he give me if I ask?

556
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:40,042
Already, when a girl went missing
in your clan, your father tortured our guys.

557
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,000
- Better, marry that guy.
- No, I can't live without you.

558
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:43,875
- I'll die.
- No, Deepa.

559
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,708
We can't live together.

560
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,167
They will not let us to live.

561
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,917
Don't perplex your mind.

562
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,500
We are different.

563
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,250
We can't live together.

564
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,458
Tell me now,
I'll come with you.

565
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,292
- Mom!
- Anbu! Look at your mother!

566
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,417
Since the cloth strangled the neck,
the blood vessels were cut...

567
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,625
...and the brain lost it's functioning.

568
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:31,583
She is in coma.

569
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,625
- Oh, no!
- No chances of her to recover.

570
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,750
She will be like this till her death.
Sorry.

571
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,708
Oh, no!

572
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:40,458
Mom!

573
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,833
Come soon, I have work in home.

574
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,833
How if you feel shy for this?

575
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,333
Dad!
Oh, no!

576
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:04,833
On the eve of engagement of his son,
he married a lower caste girl...

577
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,958
...and was living in Chennai.

578
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,917
If you get shocked just for this!

579
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,917
Still there are many more like this.

580
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:13,708
Parasuraman has killed his daughter.

581
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:17,833
- Look at that.
- This case is under investigation.

582
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,083
The people of that area is panicked
on this honour killing.

583
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,708
Stella.

584
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,000
Go for the ride.

585
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:27,083
You're the first in the order.

586
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,333
I'm not going.
You go.

587
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,333
- Should I go?
- Yes, you go.

588
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:31,458
Sir, come.

589
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,292
Have it.

590
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,042
- Give me three thousand rupees.
- Already, you have pledged the watch,

591
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,250
And yet to redeem it.

592
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,125
Meanwhile, you’re pledging the ring.

593
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:48,458
Is it your's?

594
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,167
- Yes.
- Because, many theft jewels are coming.

595
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,542
Don’t mistake me.
- No, sir! It’s mine.

596
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,292
Am I right?

597
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,000
- Yes, true.
- Nothing

598
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:53,708
Okay.

599
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,958
- What, sir?
- Come, Anbu.

600
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,458
Don’t you know who will bring
theft jewelry?

601
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,208
It’s my duty to ask.

602
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,417
That’s why, I asked.

603
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,458
What, dude?

604
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,083
Brother, I came to pledge the ring.

605
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,292
Is he known to you?

606
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:05,167
Yes.

607
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,708
I can believe and give him, right?

608
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,750
- Known guy, the guy next door.
- Okay, then fine.

609
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,375
It’s okay, if you say.

610
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,625
Take it, Rs.3000

611
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,542
This month due, I’ll pay
next month after incentive…

612
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,625
Brother, I’ll leave.

613
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,250
Okay.

614
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,542
Kathir!

615
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:35,917
Where is your ring?

616
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,208
Hey, look here.

617
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,750
New Axe spray has been launched.

618
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,708
- The fragrance is good, right!
- Kathir!

619
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:45,208
Have you pledged it?

620
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,625
Then what to do?

621
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,042
Have to pay the rent.

622
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,500
Kathir, where is the rice?

623
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,500
Isn't there rice in the bag?

624
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:01,417
That is!

625
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,583
Hey, I told at the shop.

626
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,542
I think he had missed it.

627
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:10,042
When you know to buy body spray,
don’t you know to buy rice?

628
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,042
Hey, what you…

629
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,542
I told him, he didn’t pack it.

630
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:19,083
Okay, you arrange these things.
I’ll go and get it.

631
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,125
The money we had is over.

632
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:25,500
Now you have pledged the ring,
later you’ll sell.

633
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:28,333
You will pledge the chain
then you’ll sell.

634
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:29,375
Then?

635
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,667
I’m getting afraid, Kathir.

636
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,500
Hey, did I say that I’ll not
go for job?

637
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,958
Yesterday, I went to Taj Coromandel.

638
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,375
I went to DLF.

639
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,500
Wherever I go, they are asking for certificates.

640
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:42,375
We’ve not got that.

641
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:43,875
What should I do?

642
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:47,667
Kathir, now too we’re eating
with your father’s money.

643
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,125
Not with your money.

644
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,208
Kathir, I like you very much.

645
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:02,500
I’m burdening you,
which I can understand.

646
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,792
Kathir, forgive me.

647
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:10,042
The money what you earn is not important.

648
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:14,042
The belief that you’re going to job
is enough.

649
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,250
Go to a job.

650
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:17,042
Go to any job you get.

651
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,542
I’m working in Axis bank.

652
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,500
Getting sufficient salary,
though everything is there.

653
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,375
I’m looking for a bride.

654
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,958

It has fallen down, it seems.

702
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:14,958

705
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,750
Brother, I got a job at Taj Coromandel.
- Good, dude.

706
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,208
- Sister, give me two plate idly.
- Sit down.

707
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,292
Give them idly.

708
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,083
Okay, sister.

709
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,167
Hey, petrol price is getting hiked.

710
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,000
- Brother, have it.
- On our way, let’s fill up the petrol.

711
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:57,417
Hey, dude.

712
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,375
We missed the way and
came to Taj Coromandel.

713
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,292
Hey, here Idly will cost Rs. 2000 to 3000.

714
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,583
- Have to pledge the auto, I guess.
- Brother, don’t tease me.

715
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:05,167
Brother, eat.

716
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,125
Working at street shop and exaggerating
as if working in Taj Coromandel.

717
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:08,917
Brother, just leave it.

718
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,958
Hey, you went for interview there,
what happened?

719
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,750
I did the interview well.

720
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:15,000
But, they rejected me since
I don’t know to speak english.

721
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:17,458
What nonsense,
you talk in front of me.

722
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,542
You don’t know English?

723
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:21,458
The teacher in Madurai,
he himself doesn’t know to speak English.

724
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:22,875
Then, how can I speak?

725
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,208
For that, why are you looking sober?

726
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,167
Buy a quarter everyday and come to me
in the evening for two hours to learn English.

727
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,500
I’ll teach you English.

728
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,625
- Okay.
- Brother, don’t tease me.

729
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:34,333
You eat now.

730
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,375
Anyway, If I eat here,
It'll upset my stomach.

731
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:37,750
I’ll come and tease you, tomorrow.

732
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,208
- Brother.
- What, dude?

733
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:41,458
Tell me, If you know a better job.

734
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:48,083
Is he Ambani, having ten ships,
seven choppers and nine flights...

735
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,917
...and also having ten petrol stations.

736
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,208
Ask him, he will give you a job.

737
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,958
Hey, will you work in petrol station?

738
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,250
Petrol station!

739
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,000
That’s better than this job.
Okay, I’ll do.

740
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,333
Be ready at tomorrow morning.

741
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,542
Hefty money will be collected
in petrol station.

742
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,458
- Will he be trust worthy?
- Yes, you can trust him.

743
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,250
Brother, he is my neighbour.

744
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,917
Then, it's okay.
Ask him to take up the work.

745
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,208
Okay, brother.

746
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,583
Brother, Check the meter.

747
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:27,542
Take it.
Eat.

748
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:28,458
Just a minute.

749
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,625
This is my first salary earned.

750
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,125
I've spent my father’s money a lot.

751
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,625
But, today...

752
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,833
I stood till my legs are hurt,

753
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:47,792
...shed sweat
and when I got the money,

754
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,833
I felt so happy.

755
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,917
I feel more happier than you.

756
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,417
Eat this.

757
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,125
Cheers!

758
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,292
I'm holding a glass.

759
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,042
- That is...
- I'm having many thoughts.

760
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,792
- Hold this.
- Why? Why?

761
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,042
It's all a free booze.

762
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:17,208
Don’t know what it is!
My body is like…

763
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,375
Holding on the gun
and filling up the petrol, right?

764
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:26,083
Feeling pain in hand..

765
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,958
Taking pills is of no use.

766
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:31,250
Pain will not be relieved.

767
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:32,750
Hey, trickster!

768
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:34,167
Do you want to booze?

769
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:35,875
Hey, not that.

770
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,208
Okay, go.

771
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:38,917
Really?

772
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,042
Stay in limits.

773
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:41,750
Only this little.

774
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:42,917
Is this enough?

775
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:45,250
Brother, this is very less.
Pour some more.

776
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,542
Very less!

777
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,958
Brother, drinking this is like bite of an ant.

778
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,042
Brother, pour some more.

779
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:59,167
I only know how I competed with others
and bought the liquor.

780
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,750
- Enough?
- Brother, pour some more.

781
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,833
Hey, if I pour for you more.
Then it will be like a snake bite for me.

782
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:04,625
- Is that okay?
- No, need.

783
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:06,917
Add some water and drink.

784
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:09,917
Brother, it's enough.

785
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,542
I didn't add the water, yet.

786
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,667
Give it to me.

787
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:16,917
Why is he opening the jug?

788
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:18,667
Is he going to fill the jug and drink?

789
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:21,792
- You crook.
- Hey.

790
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,583
Hey!

791
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,375
The intestines may burn.
Drink slowly.

792
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,792
- Is he competing with us?
- Drinking without diluting.

793
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,667
Hey!

794
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,500
Gone?

795
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,583
- He will take over us.
- Hey,

796
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,500
I can't afford to buy alcohol again.

797
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:39,000
He is drinking heavily.
- Dude!

798
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:46,875
Brother, why are they bursting crackers?

799
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:53,125
My father will buy crackers
for two lakhs, every year.

800
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,292
I’m the only son.

801
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,750
I’ll burst the crackers as a single guy.

802
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,917
The whole village will wonder at me.

803
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,875
I'm fond of my father.

804
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:09,083
For that, if he blaze malar in home...

805
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,250
...it’s wrong, isn't it?

806
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,250
Who is bothered about caste?

807
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,667
Will my caste give me the happiness
like living with Malar?

808
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,250
Malar is very pitiful.

809
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:22,958
She is also suffering along with me.

810
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,083
It’s our first Diwali, post marriage.

811
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:30,292
Working in petrol station
for just Rs.500 salary.

812
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:33,125
I told that I'll take care of her lika a Queen.

813
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:34,542
It’s not possible, I think.

814
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:38,458
Very pity.

815
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:41,500
Wonder, what am I going to do!

816
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,458
Only after watching this businessman,
We remember Diwali.

817
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,125
Do you know, I’m a fan to his dance.

818
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,708
Dude, he is a legend.

819
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:52,750
Hey, dude!

820
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:55,375
I bought a dress for Vasanthi's son.

821
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,917
Don’t know in which bag I kept it.

822
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,542
Look in the Orange coloured bag.

823
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,708
It must be there, check it.

824
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,792
It's okay, if it isn't there.

825
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,708
Give me, I'll keep it in the auto,

826
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:15,125
Enough, it’s getting late.

827
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:15,708
I’m leaving.

828
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,625
Kathir, what shall I cook for dinner?

829
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:20,333
Anything is okay.

830
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,958
My husband is sincerely going to work.

831
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:27,583
Should I not cook what he likes!
- what I like!

832
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,042
You mean, what I like?

833
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,167
What I like?

834
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,500
You didn’t agree to do, what I like.

835
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:36,667
Are you okay, for today?

836
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:37,833
Hey, go away.

837
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,667
Always thinking of the same.

838
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,458
Hey, Kathir!

839
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:49,125
This is our first Diwali,
post marriage, isn't it?

840
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:50,792
Look here.

841
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:53,958
This year, we don’t have money.

842
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,333
Next year, let's celebrate grandeur.

843
00:48:57,583 --> 00:49:01,708
But, if you had married
among your relatives...

844
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,708
...They would’ve given money
and jewels to you, right?

845
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:08,083
You too would’ve been happy.

846
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:13,000
But, I wouldn’t have got my Malar.

847
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:14,917
For me, Malar is my happiness.

848
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:16,625
Shall I leave?

849
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:27,333
- Hey, Kathir!
- Brother.

850
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:28,292
Come here.

851
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,125
Brother, tell me.

852
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,375
We’re leaving to our village.

853
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:30,917
Have it.

854
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,208
- Brother, why?
- Have it.

855
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,167
- I’ll be back in 4 to 5 days.
- Brother, I don’t want.

856
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,167
Hey, have it.

857
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,792
Buy new attires.

858
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,292
Don’t worry about anything
and stay happy.

859
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:40,958
Hey!

860
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:42,500
Thank you, brother.

861
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:46,833
Kathir, Happy Diwali.

862
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,208
Brother, don’t make fun of me.

863
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,542
Use my bike for going to work.

864
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,500
Kathir, don’t drive fast,
drive slowly.

865
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:56,875
- Okay.
- Hey!

866
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,417
Don’t make fun of me.

867
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,458
Take care.

868
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,083
You enjoy.

869
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,750

Kathir!

Driver, better runaway.

914
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,000
Someone call for an ambulance.

915
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:46,375
Malar!

916
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,958
Hey, move away.
Give way.

917
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,250
Kathir, nothing will happen to you.

918
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:01,708
Kathir!

919
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:03,708
Kathir!

920
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:21,708
Doctor, Kathir!

921
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:22,958
How is he now?

922
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:25,208
Has any elders have come?

923
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:32,792
Oh, no!

924
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,500
I advised him.

925
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:37,125
(Indistinct voices)

926
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,917
He didn’t listen to
what we said and left.

927
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,750
You departed from us.

928
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:44,333
Now, it cost him his death.

929
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,542
Get the signature from her.
- Okay, Doctor.

930
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:06,792
Mam!

931
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:08,250
Kathir!

932
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:10,125
Sign in this form.

933
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:15,125
How is Kathir, now?

934
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:18,167
Tomorrow, the Chief Doctor will come
and tell you.

935
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,500
Transfer the patient of bed 3 to normal ward.
- Doctor!

936
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:40,167
Okay, sir.

937
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:41,958
- Doctor, Kathir!
- Yes.

938
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,083
- Which patient is she asking about?
- Kathir, an accident case, sir.

939
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:47,417
You mean the accident patient,
who’s skull got opened?

940
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,417
Yes, doctor.

941
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,792
Good improvement.

942
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:50,833
Don't worry.

943
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,583
But, he needs to be in ICU for observation.

944
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:53,375
Maybe a week.

945
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,333
He will be fine.
Okay, don’t worry.

946
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:59,208
Don’t worry.
Doctor has said he will be fine.

947
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,833
It’s been two days since you came here.

948
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,500
Go home, refresh and come.

949
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:03,958
- I’ll take care of him.
- No, I’ll be here.

950
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,708
It's night duty for me, I’ll take care.
You go.

951
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:12,250
Mam, Where is Malar house?

952
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,208
- Sir, this house.
- Arumugam!

953
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:15,958
- Come and see here.
- Sister, what happened?

954
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,708
Mam!

955
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,333
Any problem?
The police has come.

956
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:20,500
Who is Malar here?
Come out.

957
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:22,708
- Since the police has arrived, it must be big issue.
- What, sir?

958
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,375
- Mam.
- Any problem?

959
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:33,833
Sir!

960
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,792
What happened?

961
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:38,250
You come to the hospital.

962
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:39,125
Sir!

963
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:41,083
Hope nothing has happened to Kathir?

964
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:43,250
Nothing.

965
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:45,083
You come.

966
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:49,250
Sister, come this side.

967
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:01,583
Can you accompany me?

968
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:22,708
(Mourning song)

969
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:25,500
- (Mourning song)
- Kathir!

970
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,875
- (Mourning song)
- Kathir!

971
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:35,375
(Mourning song)

972
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:38,917
- (Mourning song)
- Don't allow her to leave, kill her.

973
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,250
Hey!

974
00:59:57,208 --> 01:00:03,125
(Indistinct voices)

975
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:23,000
Listen to me,
be calm.

976
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:24,667
Kathir!

977
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:29,542
(Indistinct voices)

978
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,708
They have brought Kathir.

979
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:48,708
(Mourning voices)

980
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,417
I brought you up with utmost affection.

981
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:59,792
You left us all.

982
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,542
Kathir!

983
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,083
Look at your son.

984
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:07,125
Our son left us.

985
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,625
Kathir!

986
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,667
Kathir!

987
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,625
Leave me.

988
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:18,292
I’m going.
Kathir, I’ll also come with you.

989
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,625
- Kathir!
- Hey, you too come.

990
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:23,417
My son-in-law is asking for
a companion to die along.

991
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:29,375
Leave me.

992
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,917
Kathir!

993
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,708
You leave from here
or else they will beat you to death.

994
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,083
Listen to me.

995
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:45,875
Kathir!

996
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,375
Kathir!

997
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:55,292
Listen to me.

998
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:05,208
Kathir!

999
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:28,000
Hey, to have relationship with my son,
you brought him here and killed him.

1000
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:32,208
I’ll witness you.

1001
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:35,958
You will be wandering with someone
for the sake of money.

1002
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,167
I’ll witness you here itself.

1003
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:37,000
INTERMISSION

1004
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:18,667
Every year, I'll give you
a surprise like this.

1005
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,125
Why did you bring her here?

1006
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:26,875
Is this necessary for us?

1007
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:30,042
She asked for a help and I sent you.

1008
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:33,458
Instead, you brought her again.

1009
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,917
We are struggling to lead our life.

1010
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,625
Do you want to get her
along with us?

1011
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,417
She is pityful, dude.

1012
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,625
If you'd have seen the incidents
happened there...

1013
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:43,792
...you will not talk like this.

1014
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,958
Kathir's relatives would've
beaten her to death.

1015
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,917
When looking her face,
I reminded of Kathir.

1016
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:55,500
If I wouldn't have given bike
and money to Kathir,

1017
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,458
He would've been alive, I think.

1018
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,958
I feel guilty that I'm also
a reason for his death.

1019
01:05:02,042 --> 01:05:04,167
I found her parent's contact number
and called them.

1020
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,917
Her aunt attended the call.

1021
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:09,500
She said, she is not our daughter.
We disown her and disconnected the call.

1022
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:13,042
How can I leave a girl, abandoned?

1023
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:15,042
That’s why, I brought her.

1024
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:17,500
Are you seeking remedy
for your father's act?

1025
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:21,125
I think it's an unnecessary job,
take care.

1026
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:28,833
Are you seeking remedy
for your father's act?

1027
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:27,458
I'd have died.

1028
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:32,667
I'd have died when Kathir was hurt.

1029
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:35,583
There was a chance of life.

1030
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:39,458
I thought he will come alive
for my sake.

1031
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,417
But he deceived me.

1032
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:48,917
I thought of seeing
his face finally and die.

1033
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:53,250
But I couldn't.

1034
01:06:54,417 --> 01:06:57,875
We both came to live happily.

1035
01:06:57,958 --> 01:07:02,417
His father's words shouldn't come true.

1036
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,500
I must live.

1037
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:09,708
My Kathir is with me.
I must live.

1038
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:13,583
I must live with his memories.

1039
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,500
This shouldn't happen to
anyone, brother.

1040
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:19,250
At this young age...

1041
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:19,833
Yes.

1042
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:21,750
- Take the things, outside.
- Okay, brother.

1043
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,250
Brother, what about the mat and pillow?

1044
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:25,500
It's a lucky mat.
Take it carefully.

1045
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:29,167
Anand, take it carefully.
Can't you take it safely?

1046
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,792
It slipped, brother.

1047
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:32,333
What are you going
to do now, Maari?

1048
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:36,250
I got a call that the guy is dead
and the girl was left alone.

1049
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:39,750
Oh, no!
It was disheartening.

1050
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:40,708
Brother, move away.

1051
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,958
I've rented out the house
to many people.

1052
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,250
But, such an incident
has never happened.

1053
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:47,542
It's painful.

1054
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:51,583
Somehow, they are related to us.
That's why...

1055
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:56,125
Switch off the TV.

1056
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:56,708
Why?

1057
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:57,583
Switch it off.

1058
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,375
Brother, it's we who brought them here.

1059
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:04,958
If anything happens to them,
we will be questioned.

1060
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,667
We are responsible.

1061
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,125
Why is she like this?

1062
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,292
They will all come together.

1063
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:11,583
If they ask the guy is dead,
what about the girl?

1064
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:13,667
So, we have to protect them.

1065
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:16,542
I've seen a house in Ramalinga nagar
near to my house.

1066
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,917
I'll send her safely along with
her parents when they come.

1067
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:22,167
Until then, who will take care
of her other than me?

1068
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:24,458
What are you doing, brother?

1069
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,500
I'm playing cricket.

1070
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:28,292
Can't you see what I'm doing?

1071
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:30,750
Seems like you're playing
a game with cowries.

1072
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:32,375
Reply to my query.

1073
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:34,792
I made her to stay here.

1074
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,000
My relative girl.

1075
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:37,375
Her husband is dead.

1076
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:38,750
Who else is here other than me?

1077
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,125
Who is related to whom?

1078
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:43,375
If you're a middleman,
you should do only your job.

1079
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:44,958
Instead, you're vacating the house.

1080
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,208
Dude, it's my duty to protect that girl.

1081
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,708
Oh, we will take care of everything.

1082
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:52,833
Shut your trap and go.

1083
01:08:52,917 --> 01:08:55,417
I'm replying patiently to your queries.

1084
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:57,083
Who are you to question me?

1085
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,000
If anything happens to her,
who will answer?

1086
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:01,125
Uncle.
Take your hand.

1087
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:02,708
Everyone is talking philosophy.
As if they are perfect.

1088
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:06,417
Hey, granny!
Won't you shut your mouth?

1089
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:09,208
- Uncle!
- You always suppress me.

1090
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:14,625
You talk like a big cheese.
Is that girl a relative to you?

1091
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,583
When you dragged her hand,
she must have come if she is your relative.

1092
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,583
Did she come?

1093
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:19,667
Fraudster.

1094
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:21,167
What's this, dude?

1095
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:21,958
You're rocking!

1096
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,250
Do you think no one can ask you?

1097
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,625
I'll ask you.

1098
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:27,417
Do you think women are cheap?

1099
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:30,375
Will you go with him?

1100
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:31,792
Is he your relative?

1101
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:34,250
Tell me.

1102
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm asking you.
Will you go with him?

1103
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:44,542
Hey, you go away from here.
Else, I might yell at you.

1104
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:46,917
This is the job I'm doing
for many years.

1105
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,917
It seems, you're starting only now.

1106
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:52,083
Let me see, where and how
will you help her to live?

1107
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:55,333
My clan is everywhere.

1108
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:57,917
I'll see to you later.

1109
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:00,625
House owner, yesterday
two policemen came.

1110
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:03,292
Hereafter, guys will come and enjoy.

1111
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,750
This house will become a lodge.

1112
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:08,667
And both of you will go to prison
for doing business with women.

1113
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,875
Then, these guys will be
the middlemen for this business.

1114
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:12,000
Hey, whom do you call as middlemen?

1115
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:12,958
- Get lost.
- Brother!

1116
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,583
- Hey!
- Hey!

1117
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,083
- Henceforth, if I see you here...
- Brother, come. Let's go.

1118
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,958
We got a customer from
SRT college, Salem.

1119
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,875
The girl looks chubby.

1120
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:22,875
Anbu, we can't let this girl
stay here at this stance.

1121
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:25,333
He'd have taken her.
You denied that too.

1122
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:29,375
Anbu, I'm saying strictly.
That girl shouldn't stay here.

1123
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:32,875
If you don't like what I say,
better you too vacate the house.

1124
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,208
Don't mistake me, Anbu.

1125
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:37,458
Many families reside here.
I don't know any other way, Anbu.

1126
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:44,667
I'll give you surprise
every year, like this.

1127
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,667
You're a big surprise to me.

1128
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:52,542
You wander with someone
for sake of money.

1129
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,583
Let's go straight to my sister's house.

1130
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,875
Let her stay there for four days.
We will see later.

1131
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:02,792
Okay.

1132
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,417
Shankar, you left your wife
and children in your hometown...

1133
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,708
...and roaming with a girl here.

1134
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:35,208
Moreover, you want her
to stay in my house.

1135
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,833
If your brother-in-law knows,
he will kick me out of the house.

1136
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:42,750
I didn't expect Kamatchi
to talk like this.

1137
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:47,542
Let's try for ladies hostel.
- We have some rules, sir.

1138
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,833
Either there should be an ID proof
or certificate.

1139
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:52,500
Else, we need a recommendation
letter from the working place.

1140
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,333
Without these, no one will admit.

1141
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,542
We are going around with a girl
in an auto at this odd time.

1142
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:57,708
I'm feared.

1143
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,833
Hey, the police is coming.

1144
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,667
Greetings, sir.

1145
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,667
Why are you here now?

1146
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,208
That's nothing, sir.

1147
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,583
Have to go till airport.

1148
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:35,083
The customer is coming.
That's why, I'm waiting, sir.

1149
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:38,750
Why have you covered the auto?

1150
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:41,083
It's snowy, isn't it?
That's why.

1151
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,750
Oh, you've covered the auto
since it might shiver.

1152
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:45,750
We will leave now, sir.

1153
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:47,292
We ride the auto
from this stand, sir.

1154
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,583
We will leave as soon as
the customer arrives.

1155
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:49,625
Sir!

1156
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,792
- Senthil!
- Sir!

1157
01:12:58,833 --> 01:12:59,708
- You go to the station.
- Okay, sir.

1158
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,875
Sir!

1159
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:07,333
Raji dear, I got a phone call
from the IG office.

1160
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,542
Suddenly, I'm scheduled night shift.
I'll come in the morning.

1161
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:10,500
Okay?

1162
01:13:10,542 --> 01:13:12,500
Lock the door.
Be careful.

1163
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,708
Sir, she isn't that kind of girl.

1164
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:16,792
Please, sir.
Listen to me, sir.

1165
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,083
Is this Royal lodge?

1166
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:19,708
Inspector Paramasivam, speaking.

1167
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:20,958
Is Room no.143 available?

1168
01:13:21,042 --> 01:13:21,917
Very lucky room.

1169
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:23,083
No, sir.
Sir...

1170
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,125
Along with a girl.

1171
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,458
Clean it up.

1172
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,458
She isn't the kind of girl you think.

1173
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,083
Sir!

1174
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,417
No, sir.

1175
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,708
Listen to me, sir.

1176
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,000
Please, sir.

1177
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,125
Sir...

1178
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:34,500
Believe me, sir.

1179
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:35,667
She is pitiful, sir.

1180
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:36,458
Sir...

1181
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,750
Take the vehicle.

1182
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:38,667
Sir, I plead you...

1183
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:41,042
Hey, you...
I told you to take the vehicle.

1184
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:09,875
- Hey!
- Sir.

1185
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:10,833
Have you gone too far?

1186
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:11,917
No, sir. I'm nearby.

1187
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:14,125
- Come immediately.
- To the same autostand?

1188
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:18,250
Raji, the programme was cancelled.

1189
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:20,542
I'm coming home.

1190
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,000
She seems to be a good girl.

1191
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:30,917
Take care.

1192
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,542
Take it, Anbu.

1193
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:47,167
You come this side.

1194
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,875
It's dawn.

1195
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:03,958
Sadha is not attending the call.
If someone notice us, it'll be a shame.

1196
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:11,167
Sadha is coming.

1197
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:12,958
When he is coming?

1198
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,333
Coming too late and cool.

1199
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:15,417
You...

1200
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:16,875
Hey, do you've sense?

1201
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:17,875
How many times to call you?

1202
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:18,792
Can't you attend the call?

1203
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:19,958
Sorry, I kept the phone and was sloshed.

1204
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,333
The house is ready.
Come, let's go.

1205
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,375
Dude, take the vehicle.

1206
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,000
Dude, follow me.

1207
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,208
Where are they rushing at this time?

1208
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,917
- Only their children have to study.
- Our children should rear pigs.

1209
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:39,833
Still how long?

1210
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,708
The house owner is bit tough.

1211
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,167
I'll say whatever I wish.
Don't care.

1212
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:43,958
Come.

1213
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:45,542
Come on.

1214
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,958
Uncle, this is the house.

1215
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:49,250
The rent is Rs.3000

1216
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:50,917
- I finalized it for Rs.2500
- Excellent!

1217
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:51,917
Five months rent to be paid
as an advance.

1218
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,667
We will pay.

1219
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,208
The middleman has to be paid Rs.2500

1220
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:55,958
Isit?
Dude, is it okay?

1221
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,667
Let's give.

1222
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:57,583
The middleman is my friend.

1223
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:58,708
I'll get you time.
He will accept.

1224
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:59,917
- Okay.
- I'll talk to him.

1225
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,833
- Dude, thank you very much.
- It's okay, dude.

1226
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,792
You can't get this kind of house
in this area.

1227
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:03,708
Okay.

1228
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:04,708
Sister!

1229
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:06,542
Sister!

1230
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,458
She looks like an alien
made of airbag.

1231
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,458
- Is she the house owner?
- She is the councillor.

1232
01:16:25,375 --> 01:16:27,917
She will kick me out,
If knew about me.

1233
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,625
- I need to piss.
- Wait.

1234
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,292
- Greetings, sister!
- Greetings, sister!

1235
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:34,542
Sadha, to whom is the house?

1236
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:36,042
The house is for them, sister.

1237
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:37,708
Don't look like that, sister.

1238
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:38,667
It's love marriage.

1239
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:41,083
It's been two months.

1240
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:42,667
He is with me in the auto stand.

1241
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:45,083
Good guy.
He belongs to my hometown.

1242
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,750
You...

1243
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:48,750
Sister, that's nothing.

1244
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:50,083
He doesn't know to drive.

1245
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:53,125
He has no experience,
that's why got hurt.

1246
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:56,208
Look here, dude.
I'm very strict.

1247
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,125
I must get the rent by
10th of every month.

1248
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,125
Okay, sister.

1249
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:01,042
You must come home by
11 o'clock in the night.

1250
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,625
I'll lock the gate
and take away the key.

1251
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:03,542
Then, you've to sleep outside.

1252
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:09,583
Similarly, if any noise emerge upstairs,
I'll throw you along with all the things.

1253
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,625
- Is it okay?
- Okay, sister.

1254
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:13,125
What a condition!

1255
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:14,125
Who is he?

1256
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,292
Dude, Introduce me.

1257
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:16,250
He is my uncle.

1258
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,667
My uncle, sister.

1259
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:18,917
Tell me your contact number.

1260
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,875
Why?

1261
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:23,708
To lift you if any problem arises.

1262
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:26,708
Sir, I'll stay back in auto.

1263
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:27,750
You come and pay for the ride.

1264
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:28,625
Hey, dude!

1265
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:29,625
Hey, blue shirt!

1266
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:30,542
Believe me, sister.

1267
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:33,292
Open the door.
I told everything and brought them here.

1268
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:41,292
Get inside.

1269
01:17:57,167 --> 01:18:01,042
I think, this place will be safe
as of now.

1270
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:04,708
Many families stay here.

1271
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,958
You talk with the children.

1272
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,250
Move along, casually.

1273
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:15,917
If possible, try to forget everything.

1274
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:19,417
Call me immediately,
whatever you need.

1275
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:22,375
I'm leaving.

1276
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,417
Leave this house,
else you will be spared.

1277
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,250
Drunkard, how hard are
you hitting me?

1278
01:19:01,292 --> 01:19:03,083
I'll hit you like this
if you don't give me money.

1279
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:05,083
Get lost by falling
in pond or lake.

1280
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,500
Why should I die?
You go and die.

1281
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:07,083
Hey, I'm telling you, right?

1282
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:08,542
Some people die but you aren't.

1283
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,083
Hey, what's the noise there?

1284
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,250
You go and die.

1285
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:12,375
Won't you suppress?

1286
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,708
- Sister, look at him.
- Get in.

1287
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:14,750
I said get in.

1288
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,208
I'll be peaceful only if he dies.

1289
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,583
This has become routine for you.

1290
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,458
He is hitting me, everyday.

1291
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,750
Open the door.

1292
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:50,708
Hey, moustache!
The onions are looking small.

1293
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:54,125
All onions will look small
if it's in your hands.

1294
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:56,625
- Sister!
- What?

1295
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,667
You told me to deliver
the water can.

1296
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,583
I'm knocking the door for long time
but no one is opening.

1297
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,875
Open the door.

1298
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:03,917
Sister, I'll keep the water can out,
I'll come and take it in the evening.

1299
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:06,792
Dear, open the door.
Open the door.

1300
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,750
I'm knocking the door.

1301
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:09,792
Open the door.

1302
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,625
I'm calling you.

1303
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,167
Eat.

1304
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,333
You...

1305
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:36,667
I said, eat it.

1306
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,000
Dude, on TV programme today,

1307
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:46,042
It's predicted for my sign
that I'll be out of trouble.

1308
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,958
So, I'm going to be happy
like a new born baby.

1309
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,750
- Hello!
- Hey, fraudsters!

1310
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:52,125
Where are you all?
How dare you cheat me?

1311
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,542
You should be here in ten minutes.
Come on.

1312
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,500
'The flowers are blossoming
for my sake'

1313
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,208
Who is on the phone?

1314
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,375
The house owner.

1315
01:21:04,792 --> 01:21:07,625
Her face is changing
like an angry potato.

1316
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:10,625
Wonder, what will happen.

1317
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:12,083
Hey, you leave.

1318
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,375
Who is she to you?

1319
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,250
She is crying without eating.

1320
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:17,333
What's your story?

1321
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,708
Say something and manage her.

1322
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:20,708
Sister!

1323
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:30,542
Her aunt is dead.
She thinks of her and crying.

1324
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:36,708
Sister!

1325
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:39,083
I'll tell you the truth.

1326
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:40,875
- What are you going to say?
- Hey!

1327
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:48,708
We are different people.
She is a lower caste girl.

1328
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:50,708
We fell in love
when studying in college.

1329
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:58,125
My father didn't like it.
He tried to blaze her in their home.

1330
01:21:59,042 --> 01:22:03,583
Since we have no other way,
we both eloped.

1331
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:06,708
It's okay if whatever happens to me.

1332
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:10,292
But, nothing should hurt her.

1333
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,333
So?

1334
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:14,042
Will you abandon her?

1335
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:15,083
No, sister.

1336
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:17,125
Still our clan is searching for us.

1337
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:22,958
If they see us together,
they will lynch us.

1338
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:25,208
Does caste still matters?

1339
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,292
I too had an inter-caste marriage.

1340
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,708
Who is that generous person!

1341
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:30,083
Hey!

1342
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:33,458
Not that, I just tried to say
that you've a generous mind.

1343
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,208
It's true.

1344
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:36,625
Who will come?

1345
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,583
No one can come here.

1346
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:39,583
I'll take care.

1347
01:22:39,667 --> 01:22:41,958
Do you know who I am, right?

1348
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:43,375
Azaghu Rani.(Beautiful queen)

1349
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,167
The councillor of this town.

1350
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,167
You must stay here only.

1351
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,250
This is my fort.

1352
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:50,000
Let me see, who is coming here.

1353
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:50,875
Get inside.

1354
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:53,375
Go.

1355
01:22:53,917 --> 01:22:55,458
Hey, why are you standing?

1356
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:56,375
You too get inside.

1357
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:57,208
Then, let me go.

1358
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,125
You stay back.

1359
01:22:58,167 --> 01:22:59,125
I need to talk with you.

1360
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:00,500

Who are you?
Whom do you want?

1411
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:01,000
Malar...

1412
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:03,167
It's been a week since we moved here.

1413
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:04,917
I don't know who she is.

1414
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:07,042
Better, enquire someone else.

1415
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:14,167
Dude, you won't leave a job
without completing it.

1416
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,750
How did you let her go
without killing?

1417
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:18,250
I'll leave this place only
after killing her.

1418
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:27,083
I was very afraid that the job
will be issued based on the marks...

1419
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:29,375
but they have given
based on experience.

1420
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,417
Get on, come.

1421
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:41,875
Sister told that you've
come in search of job.

1422
01:26:42,917 --> 01:26:46,583
Kathir's uncle has gone to
the old house in search of you.

1423
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:49,500
So, don't go anywhere
for a few days.

1424
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,292
Ask me if you want anything.

1425
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,458
I'm coming near the auto stand.
Come and pick me up.

1426
01:26:57,542 --> 01:26:58,500
Hey, where did you go?

1427
01:26:58,583 --> 01:26:59,417
Where will I go?

1428
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:00,500
I went for a ride.

1429
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:03,833
- Hey, stop.
- What?

1430
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:05,792
I'm waiting for you since morning.

1431
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:06,458
For me?

1432
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:06,917
Yes.

1433
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:07,958
Didn't you get any ride?

1434
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,708
I got the ride but I didn't go.

1435
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:10,750
Aren't you well?

1436
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:13,208
Why? I'm good.

1437
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,125
Shall we both have tea?

1438
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:17,125
Tea for me?

1439
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:20,458
You seem to be different, today.

1440
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,583
No.

1441
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:22,917
Do you need money?

1442
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:23,708
Get lost.

1443
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:27,375
Wonder, she feels shy.

1444
01:27:27,417 --> 01:27:28,542
An information to you..

1445
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:29,542
Hey, crazy.

1446
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:30,958
This doesn't suit you.

1447
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,708
- I'm watching you, for few days...
- Hi!

1448
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:36,292
He has come.
You leave.

1449
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,333
- Be seated.
- Hey, wait.

1450
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:38,042
I'll come.

1451
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,000
Sister!

1452
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:48,000
Anbu, come immediately
to the Shrusti hospital.

1453
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:49,500
What happened, sister?

1454
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:56,250
- Sister, what happened?
- Anbu, you've become a father.

1455
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:58,292
Oh, gosh! My gold!

1456
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:00,708
I know, that's the luck of my house.

1457
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,000
Everyone will give birth
to a baby boy.

1458
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:03,333
Okay, Malar is inside.

1459
01:28:03,417 --> 01:28:04,458
I'll pay the bill and come.

1460
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,708
You go and see her.

1461
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:06,792
Nurse...

1462
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:09,042
You have to take utmost care
of her at this time.

1463
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,083
Sir, sign where it is mentioned
as 'husband'.

1464
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:19,667
Sign it.

1465
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,375
What are you thinking?

1466
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,292
- Anbu, buy all the tablets immediately.
- Okay, sister.

1467
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:50,833
Doctor has told to take
all the tablets from today.

1468
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:52,583
Malar, you need not cook today.

1469
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:55,250
Take rest.
I'll bring you food.

1470
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:59,875
If the drainage is blocked,
will I come and clear it?

1471
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:01,792
I've sent men.
They will come.

1472
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,250
- I've to tell you...
- Don't tell anything.

1473
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:09,625
Please, don't tell anything.

1474
01:29:09,667 --> 01:29:11,708
Don't want this baby.

1475
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,000
Abort it.

1476
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:15,750
You too have a life.

1477
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:18,792
Don't say anything like this.

1478
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:25,167
I was afraid what my life would be
without kathir.

1479
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:31,167
Now, Kathir is with me.

1480
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:35,875
I troubled you more.

1481
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:41,333
Just few days, then my child...

1482
01:29:43,667 --> 01:29:47,750
We will go somewhere
and lead a life.

1483
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:53,917
I've more respect on you.

1484
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:10,458
Have you seen?

1485
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:12,792
Serve me too.

1486
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Take it without dancing.

1487
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:29,083
Cheers!

1488
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:31,417
Cheers!

1489
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:33,542
Take it.

1490
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,417
- You have, dude.
- I told you to have it.

1491
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,500
You have it.

1492
01:30:37,542 --> 01:30:39,958
If you don't booze, else I will.

1493
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,083
Cheers!

1494
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:43,958
Let's have fun.

1495
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:53,917
Tell me, sister.

1496
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,375
I'll come, sister.

1497
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:59,208
Okay, sister.

1498
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:03,208
Dude, I'm going home.

1499
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:04,583
Finish the game and go.

1500
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:05,542
You carry on.

1501
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:07,917
Hey, stop.

1502
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,875
What?

1503
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:14,708
You're going since someone called.

1504
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,333
Take it.

1505
01:31:17,042 --> 01:31:19,708
- You have it.
- I don't want, uncle.

1506
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,708
Go.

1507
01:31:21,292 --> 01:31:24,042
Why are we boozing?

1508
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:34,542
When I knew she is in a problem,
I sent you along with her for protection.

1509
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:35,750
I'm a goof.

1510
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:40,917
For that sake, will you go
around her always?

1511
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:43,000
Hey, don't talk rubbish
before the guys.

1512
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,208
What, uncle?

1513
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:46,583
Nothing, it's our family matter.

1514
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:48,333
I'll take care. You go.

1515
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:51,500
We have lot of problems in our family.

1516
01:31:51,542 --> 01:31:53,625
You don't have time for that, right?

1517
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,667
How happy we all were.

1518
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Idiot, he came...

1519
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:02,458
He is dead now.

1520
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:06,208
You have a life.

1521
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:07,667
You must live it.

1522
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:08,958
It's shameful.

1523
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:11,542
You're close with that girl.

1524
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:13,750
What's the relationship between
you both?

1525
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:15,375
Tell me.

1526
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:18,667
Don't know.

1527
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:42,208
You asked you want Kathir, isn't it?

Here is the fish gravy.
You eat it.

1534
01:34:19,917 --> 01:34:22,000
- Okay, sister.
- Tell her to eat too.

1535
01:34:22,042 --> 01:34:24,417
Who is that in the photo?

1536
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,333
My brother.

1537
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:27,042
Where is he?

1538
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:28,083
Abroad.

1539
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:31,417
Okay, you eat.
Don't forget.

1540
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:33,000
Malar, you too eat.

1541
01:34:35,792 --> 01:34:38,542
How many times to tell you
not to keep hot water at the entrance?

1542
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:41,042
Hey, be careful.

1543
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:42,542
How many times
will you puke a day?

1544
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:43,833
How will you be healthy?

1545
01:34:43,917 --> 01:34:45,417
- It'll be alright.
- What happened, sister?

1546
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,333
She is puking all the time.

1547
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:49,417
You can't take care of her
and I too can't.

1548
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:51,458
Better, ask her parents to come here.

1549
01:34:51,542 --> 01:34:53,917
Only your father is a problem
not her parents, right?

1550
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:56,625
Tell them to come.
It'll be alright.

1551
01:34:58,167 --> 01:35:00,167
Hey, father is ready.

1552
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:10,000
He thinks of himself as
dance master Prabhu Deva.

1553
01:35:10,042 --> 01:35:11,667
Won't you sit without shaking your legs?

1554
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:13,708
- Don't shake.
- Where did I shake?

1555
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:16,708
- It is shaking on it's own.
- You're sitting before an elephant.

1556
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:17,792
Be careful.

1557
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:19,875
I found out who you are.

1558
01:35:20,958 --> 01:35:22,042
Oh, no!

1559
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,333
So, it's confirmed
she is going to thump me.

1560
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:25,875
You've proved that you're a good father..

1561
01:35:27,792 --> 01:35:30,417
When you knew that your
daughter is pregnant

1562
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:32,875
you came to see her
without any ego.

1563
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:35,875
That's where you proved
that you're a good father.

1564
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,083
I've become a grandfather!

1565
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:42,292
Dude, I've become a grandfather.

1566
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:44,708
Hey, you are a grandfather, already.

1567
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:47,042
Why are you over reacting?
Be quiet.

1568
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,792
I too had love marriage.

1569
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:53,833
But, I'm not gifted enough.

1570
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:59,375
When I was pregnant,
my father didn't even visit me once.

1571
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:03,042
Would have you been pregnant
for about 20 years?

1572
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:06,042
- Don't you stay quiet?
- Be calm.

1573
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:12,708
Hey, what are you performing?

1574
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:14,250
Look at that performance.

1575
01:36:14,292 --> 01:36:17,833
She is giving variety of emotions,
learn from her.

1576
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,458
It's okay.

1577
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:26,208
- You stay with her till her delivery.
- Okay.

1578
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:28,583
Sister, he can't stay here.

1579
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:29,667
He is very busy.

1580
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:31,083
If he goes today morning at 6,

1581
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:32,542
He will be back tomorrow morning
at the same time.

1582
01:36:32,583 --> 01:36:34,625
- Immediately, he will leave again to job.
- Malar!

1583
01:36:34,667 --> 01:36:36,083
Your father has come.

1584
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,708
Cook tasty food.

1585
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,875
Okay, I'll go to the Corporation office.

1586
01:36:41,417 --> 01:36:43,708
I didn't get a father like this.

1587
01:36:43,792 --> 01:36:45,708
- Hey, Aadhar faced!
- Why are you hitting me?

1588
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:48,500
When she asks you
to stay for six months...

1589
01:36:48,542 --> 01:36:51,417
...you too nod your head
for sake of food.

1590
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:52,500
Don't you have sense?

1591
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:53,292
Leave it.

1592
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:55,958
She was astonished by my performance.

1593
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,583
He has acted in the climax of
Raja Harishchandra drama...

1594
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,333
...for her to get astonished.
Get lost...

1595
01:37:00,417 --> 01:37:02,958
She is a goof who believed
your performance.

1596
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,083
You are a dolt.

1597
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:04,958
That means?

1598
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:10,750
You mean to say as Hollywood artist.

1599
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:12,625
Definitely, he is a goof.

She is very much afraid.
Please, talk to her.

Dad!

1618
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,458
I went for an audition.

1619
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,375
I saw this fish on the way.

1620
01:39:09,417 --> 01:39:13,208
Since you're pregnant
and you cook well too.

1621
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:16,500
In order to taste your cooking,
I bought this.

1622
01:39:16,542 --> 01:39:19,083
Do you like acting very much?

1623
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:22,458
It's forty years since I came to Chennai
from my native.

1624
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:24,708
In these years, I went to my native
just four times.

1625
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,292
Once, for my wedding.

1626
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,542
I came to Chennai the next day
to attend an audition.

1627
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:30,708
Later, I went to attend my first night
fixed on an auspicious day.

1628
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:32,792
Later, when my daughter was born.

1629
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:35,000
Then, I went for her wedding.

1630
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:38,375
Those who came along with me
have become superstars.

1631
01:39:38,417 --> 01:39:41,583
Unless I become a star like them,
I'll not leave from here.

1632
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:42,833
I swear!

1633
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:49,708
If only worries are life,
the earth won't bear...

1634
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:52,917
It's the film, "Thanga pathakam"
acted by Sivaji Ganesan.

1635
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,500
I attended the audition
for this film too.

1636
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:56,625
Srikanth has acted in that film.

1637
01:39:56,708 --> 01:39:58,458
That character has to be
played by me.

1638
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,792
The relationship is a cuff...

1639
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,208
Dear!

1640
01:40:16,958 --> 01:40:18,375
Dear!

1641
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:21,458
Dear!

1642
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:24,292
Dear!

1643
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:29,625
Dear!

1644
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:35,708
Dear!

1645
01:41:25,375 --> 01:41:28,333
Already came once,

1646
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:29,833
I was alright, then.

1647
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:32,917
I'll bring you fresh food.

1648
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,375
Uncle!

1649
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:46,583
Uncle!

1650
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,125
I'm calling you.

1651
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:50,833
Uncle!

1652
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:53,458
What happened, uncle?

1653
01:41:53,542 --> 01:41:58,125
Son-in-law, I was awaiting all these days
to act in films.

1654
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:00,083
Today, I've played a good character

1655
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:01,750
A father character.

1656
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:03,708
Daughter is getting fits.

1657
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:05,917
I panicked and I tried to save her.

1658
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,500
I'm the father who never lived
with a family.

1659
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:10,375
I didn't know what to do.

1660
01:42:10,417 --> 01:42:13,750
Without any movement,
I was staring at her.

1661
01:42:13,833 --> 01:42:17,000
She was blabbering in pain as, "mom".

1662
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:19,542
Applauds in theatre.

1663
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:22,250
It's enough of my acting.

1664
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:24,042
I'll go to my native.

1665
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:28,292
I'm going to live with
my wife and children.

1666
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,333
I don't want this cinema.

1667
01:42:34,167 --> 01:42:36,708
I don't want this cinema.

1668
01:42:36,708 --> 01:42:39,167
I don't want this cinema.

1669
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:47,500
Dad!

1670
01:42:49,292 --> 01:42:53,958
Dear, I think it'll be good
if dad stays with you at this time.

1671
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:56,875
He takes care of me like a father.

1672
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,042
You go.

1673
01:42:58,208 --> 01:43:01,958
She tells that
you are like her father.

1674
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,500
Take care of my daughter well.

01:45:54,042 --> 01:45:55,500
Remain the same.

That's good for you.

I'm living for your sake.

Don't leave me and go, Kathir.

01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:14,708
Kathir came in my dream.

1707
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:17,042
He said, you're taking good care.

1708
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:19,875
He said the life I lead now, is right.

1709
01:46:20,292 --> 01:46:22,458
You have a life.

1710
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:25,167
I don't want to ruin it.

1711
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:26,708
I'll leave.

1712
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:29,958
You're too generous and good.

1713
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,375
Forgive me.

1714
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:56,000
'Mortuary'

1715
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:00,375
You will wander with someone
for sake of money...

1716
01:47:00,417 --> 01:47:03,292
My son-in-law is asking for a
companion to die along, come on...

1717
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:53,708
Hey, I told you on that day,
you'll come to streets for sake of money.

1718
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:55,917
Have you come?
No...

1719
01:47:55,958 --> 01:47:58,000
Have you come?
No...

1720
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,333
I know.

1721
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,833
No, leave me.
Leave me.

1722
01:48:05,917 --> 01:48:07,333
No...

1723
01:48:14,292 --> 01:48:15,708
Why did you do this?

1724
01:48:16,583 --> 01:48:19,083
I can't say that you left
without trusting me.

1725
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:22,375
Even when you didn't know about me
you came along with me.

1726
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:24,125
What's your confusion now?

1727
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:25,917
You say you want Kathir,

1728
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:26,792
He is my brother.

1729
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:27,917
The relationship whom I lost.

1730
01:48:27,958 --> 01:48:29,333
I too want to see him.

1731
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:32,167
Until something good happens
to you, I'll be with you.

1732
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:33,500
I'll be fine.

1733
01:48:33,542 --> 01:48:35,542
I'll get a good life.

1734
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:38,708
Look here, according to me
I'm just a watchman to this house.

1735
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:39,708
That's all.

1736
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:44,333
Don't get confused, be happy.

1737
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:46,667
That's good for you and the child.

1738
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:49,583
This is the safest place for you.

1739
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:51,792
Please, understand.

1740
01:48:58,333 --> 01:48:59,417
Welcome, sir.
Greetings!

1741
01:48:59,458 --> 01:49:01,708
Coming 15th is my wedding with Stella.

1742
01:49:01,708 --> 01:49:03,458
I'm inviting you all
with this single invitation.

1743
01:49:03,542 --> 01:49:04,750
Alex, sir.
- Everyone should attend, definitely.

1744
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:06,167
Greetings, sir.

1745
01:49:06,208 --> 01:49:09,958
The invitation seems to be small.
Will the feast be grand, at least?

1746
01:49:10,042 --> 01:49:13,250
Don't worry, buffet is arranged.
You can eat as you wish.

1747
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:14,667
Is it buffet?

1748
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:15,917
No worries, then.

1749
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,708
We will come two days before
and eat well.

1750
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:20,667
You're most welcome.

1751
01:49:20,708 --> 01:49:22,667
Washing the vessels is the duty
of the maids.

1752
01:49:22,708 --> 01:49:23,750
You will come, isn't it?

1753
01:49:24,875 --> 01:49:26,083
You don't worry about anything.

1754
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:28,708
Tell us, whatever help you need.
- Sure.

1755
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:29,833
You're great, sir.

1756
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:32,375
You made Stella to fall for you
taking ride in her vehicle.

1757
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:34,083
Where is this Church?

1758
01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:35,083
- Okay, let's go.
- Don't you know this?

1759
01:49:35,125 --> 01:49:37,875
If you go in the opposite lane
to Nagesh park, a CSI Church is there.

1760
01:49:37,917 --> 01:49:40,292
- That's the Church.
- Sir, will there be drinks?

1761
01:49:40,708 --> 01:49:42,125
- Bye.
- Be seated.

1762
01:49:42,167 --> 01:49:44,125
- Kumar's wedding is also on the same date, right?
- Let's take care of it.

1763
01:49:44,167 --> 01:49:45,375
Sir, is there alcohol?

1764
01:49:45,417 --> 01:49:46,542
Shall we go?

1765
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:48,833
- I'm leaving.
- Sir, don't forget the alcohol.

1766
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:50,375
- Definitely.
- Bye.

1767
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:51,875
He seems to be a good guy.

1768
01:50:00,708 --> 01:50:03,083
- Sister.
- Brother!

1769
01:50:03,833 --> 01:50:06,625
Mother's health is critical.

1770
01:50:07,542 --> 01:50:09,708
The doctor is saying something.

1771
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:12,083
Bring dad.

1772
01:50:13,417 --> 01:50:15,542
I'm very much feared.

1773
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:22,375
Before something happens to her,
let her see dad, once.

1774
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:30,667
Mother's pulse rate is going down.

1775
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,042
Hope you understand.

1776
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:35,583
Try to come soon.

1777
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:43,042
Dinesh, where are you?

1778
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:44,292
I'm at Gummidipoondi.

1779
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:45,667
It'll take two hours to come.

1780
01:50:45,708 --> 01:50:47,250
- Is it?
- Uncle has come out on parole.

1781
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:48,500
We have to go to native.

1782
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:50,000
Come soon.
Will you come to Anbu's house, then?

1783
01:50:50,042 --> 01:50:52,250
- Okay, I'll come home.
- Okay, bye.

1784
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:58,167
- Bala sir, got the parole?
- Yes, got parole.

1785
01:50:58,208 --> 01:50:58,833
I'm leaving.

1786
01:50:58,917 --> 01:51:01,958
Hope you know the parole rules.
It's given for 30 days on conditions.

1787
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,750
So, ask him to sign at the local station
everyday at 10 o'clock.

1788
01:51:04,833 --> 01:51:05,458
Okay, sir.

1789
01:51:05,542 --> 01:51:07,792
If not signed in the morning,
the parole will be cancelled.

1790
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:09,083
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.

1791
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:10,000
Okay, take care.

1792
01:51:10,042 --> 01:51:11,833
- Call me, if you need anything.
- Okay, sir.

1793
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:14,625
Let's go.

1794
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:25,500
Sister!

1795
01:51:26,458 --> 01:51:27,625
Brother!

1796
01:51:27,708 --> 01:51:29,292
I'm bringing dad.

1797
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:30,958
Coming by Dinesh car.

1798
01:51:31,917 --> 01:51:33,542
Will reach in the morning.

1799
01:51:34,292 --> 01:51:35,083
Don’t cry.

1800
01:51:35,125 --> 01:51:37,583
Give the phone to dad.

1801
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:41,708
- Dear!
- Dad!

1802
01:51:47,583 --> 01:51:48,792
Dad!

1803
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:52,500
Give the phone to mother.

1804
01:51:52,542 --> 01:51:54,500
Mom, speak to dad.

1805
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:56,000
Dhanam!

1806
01:52:05,667 --> 01:52:06,833
Come on, dad.

1807
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:18,833
This is the house, dad.

1808
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:28,667
Be seated.

1809
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:36,292
Stella, tell me.

1810
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:37,750
Do you remember,
today is my wedding.

1811
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:39,167
My friend's wife.

1812
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:40,708
You will come for wedding, isn't it?

1813
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,750
- Yes, we are leaving.
- What about him?

1814
01:52:42,792 --> 01:52:43,917
We both are coming.

1815
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:45,208
She will be here
till the baby is born.

1816
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:46,125
Dude!

1817
01:52:46,625 --> 01:52:48,250
Stella's wedding today.
It's getting late.

1818
01:52:48,333 --> 01:52:49,417
Okay, let's go.

1819
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,125
Dad, my friend's wedding today.

1820
01:52:52,167 --> 01:52:53,583
I'll go and come back.

1821
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:55,542
The car will arrive late.

1822
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:57,792
You take bath and get ready,
let's go.

1823
01:53:00,042 --> 01:53:01,417
We will be back, uncle.

1824
01:53:03,625 --> 01:53:05,167
Prepare food for dad.

1825
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:06,417
We are going to our native today.

1826
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,667
I've told everything to sister.

1827
01:53:07,708 --> 01:53:08,917

- Be quiet.

1851
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,958
Stella, you're rocking by
covering his bald head with wig.

1852

Dinesh has come.

1865

Let's leave if dad is ready.

1866
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:47,917
Hey, look there.

1867
01:56:58,125 --> 01:57:00,500
Dude, they are still searching.

1868
01:57:00,542 --> 01:57:03,125
You can't find Malar, anymore.

1869
01:57:04,208 --> 01:57:06,708
Dinesh, you said it'll take
two hours but came early.

1870
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:09,708
Just stop the routine of giving
a month's rent for three months.

1871
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:11,000
Else, vacate the house.

1872
01:57:11,042 --> 01:57:12,667
- I'll give on time, sister.
- Go...

1873
01:58:18,667 --> 01:58:21,583
Oh, no!
My dear Malar!

1874
01:58:21,625 --> 01:58:24,833
What will I do?

1875
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:35,042
Malar!

1876
01:58:35,083 --> 01:58:39,417
What will I do, my dear?
This has happened.

1877
01:58:40,708 --> 01:58:45,500
I did a mistake.

1878
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:52,000
I've become the reason
for your death.

1879
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:59,458
Anbu, I didn't expect your father
would be a murderer.

1880
01:59:00,583 --> 01:59:03,292
Just now Malar said,
Anbu's father has come.

1881
01:59:03,375 --> 01:59:04,542
I felt happy.

1882
01:59:04,583 --> 01:59:07,208
Though Anbu married a lower caste girl,
you've come to see her...

1883
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:10,667
...when you knew she is pregnant.

1884
01:59:13,667 --> 01:59:18,833
He stood like a dumb person
when I was speaking.

1885
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:24,583
He kept everything in mind
and killed her like this.

1886
01:59:24,667 --> 01:59:27,833
A murderer!

1887
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:32,667
Malar!

1888
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:38,708
He had killed the mother
and the child, together.

1889
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:42,292
Will he be forgiven?

1890
02:00:22,708 --> 02:00:24,250
Hey!

1891
02:00:56,958 --> 02:00:59,042
He takes care of me like a father.

1892
02:01:01,917 --> 02:01:04,667
This is the safest place for you.

1893
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:11,792
What's this?

1894
02:01:11,875 --> 02:01:13,375
Why did you do like this, father?

1895
02:01:13,458 --> 02:01:14,875
Poor girl she is.

1896
02:01:14,958 --> 02:01:16,542
Didn't your casteism obdurate yet?

1897
02:01:24,792 --> 02:01:28,292
"Honour killings" often takes place
in the villages...

1898
02:01:28,375 --> 02:01:32,125
...but this murder which happened
in Chennai had caused a great chaos.

1899
02:01:32,167 --> 02:01:34,125
The public at Aminjikarai
is in a state of fear.

1900
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:38,083
Regarding this murder,
at the spot of the incident...

1901
02:02:20,125 --> 02:02:22,792
'Caste will kill man!'

1902
02:02:22,833 --> 02:02:36,792
'Religion makes man a beast!
- Thanthai Periyar.'

1903
02:04:31,333 --> 02:04:34,000
