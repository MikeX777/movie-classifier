1
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:52,317
I'm in a supermarket, you know,
and I look at the checkout girl,

2
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:56,959
or maybe I'm on the bus
and it's the bus driver...

3
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,627
or my family...

4
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,328
my daughter even,

5
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,565
but I'm looking at them and I...

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,738
I just know what they
all look like dead.

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,320
No, it's more than that. I...

8
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,280
I know what they'll
look like dying...

9
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,691
having their throats cut.

10
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,831
I can't sleep.

11
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,859
Um, I just have...

12
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,662
when I start thinking about
everything that happened,

13
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,575
uh, I start to sweat profusely.

14
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,570
I just feel like shit,
I mean, whenever anything

15
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,706
or any situation's overwhelming...

16
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,975
just everything, I mean.

17
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,716
What's your experience of...

18
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,316
fighting alongside women
in the battlefield?

19
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,158
They don't belong there.

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,322
A 7,000-foot mountain...
we gotta get to the top of it.

21
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,824
I gotta hump my ass up there
with a 100lb pack on my back.

22
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,370
You think they can do that shit?

23
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,442
Do you think they can go
92 days without a shower?

24
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,444
Are you familiar with
a fucking period?

25
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,854
- Hey.
- Hi.

26
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,935
Captain White for
Dr. Andrews, please.

27
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,333
Thank you.

28
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,188
Andrews.

29
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,988
Well, he's not returning my calls.

30
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,530
No.

31
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,121
You've seen her file.

32
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,260
What she went through is extreme.

33
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,512
Hey, Mom.

34
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,370
Yeah... no, I'm coming for sure.

35
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,917
Is she coming straight
home after school?

36
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,544
Okay, well, I'm not gonna
be able to get away

37
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,927
for another half-hour, maybe
more, so that should be perfect.

38
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,232
I'm excited too.

39
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,669
Love you too.

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,660
We're in session.

41
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,707
You're needed in Intake right away.

42
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,546
Well, it looks like we're
gonna have to cut this short.

43
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,856
I'm gonna go home
today and see Lauren.

44
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,919
Wow, I...

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,921
how long has it been?

46
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,624
Mm,

47
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,460
182 days.

48
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,168
I thought we were gonna
wait another month.

49
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,981
I think I'm ready.

50
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,010
How does your family feel about
what you're experiencing?

51
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,216
Are you in contact with them?

52
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,370
What the fuck?

53
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,542
Jesus Christ.

54
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,488
- You okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

55
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,000
What about you? Are you okay?

56
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,271
I asked you a question, Sergeant.

57
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,177
I'm good...

58
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,911
ma'am.

59
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,603
- You want to keep trying the call box?
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,946
Do you guys have the main
number for this building?

61
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,809
- You got a phone, soldier?
- Yes, ma'am.

62
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,220
Try it. Call any number.
See if it works.

63
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,755
It says I got three bars,
but it won't connect.

64
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,802
I don't fucking believe this.

65
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,444
You guys hear that?

66
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,458
- What the fuck?
- Maybe it's a fire.

67
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,798
Come on.

68
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,044
How are you doing there, Captain?

69
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,989
Anything you need me to do, ma'am?

70
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,722
Let's get these doors open.

71
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,724
We can see how far up we are.

72
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,133
Maybe we're on a floor.

73
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,966
Can't see any doors, ma'am.

74
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,206
Oldsman, you could fucking help.

75
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,676
You'd better not let go of that.

76
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,154
No, sir. No way.

77
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,216
He's right, there's nothing doing.
There's no doors in sight.

78
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,660
It's an express.

79
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,362
There she goes.

80
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,464
It's a long way down too.

81
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,243
Come on.

82
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,811
Hello.

83
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,858
Can you take your hand
off the alarm, please?

84
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,584
- Thank you.
- This is Catherine White.

85
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,665
Diego, Private First-Class.

86
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,559
And Sergeant Bradley Oldsman.

87
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,895
We've been stuck in here
five minutes and no answer.

88
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,797
We've got a lot going on, ma'am.

89
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,366
- What? What happened?
- We don't exactly know yet.

90
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,834
What do you mean you don't know?

91
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,836
How long is this gonna
take, for Christ's sake?

92
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,838
Calm down, please, ma'am.

93
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,107
We're gonna get you out,
but we've got systems down

94
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,209
and we don't know what's
going on outside.

95
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,211
We'll get back to you as
soon as we know more.

96
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,713
Who am I speaking to?

97
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,192
Lieutenant Blau,
ma'am, AMC Liaison.

98
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,053
Hey hey, come back here!

99
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,293
Hey, I want to speak to
your commanding officer.

100
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,802
Now!

101
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,572
Hello?

102
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,783
What, you want to be
stuck in here all day?

103
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,811
What do you think's
happening, ma'am?

104
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,146
She said systems were
down. It's not the power.

105
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,482
Maybe there was an earthquake.

106
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,028
Here?

107
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,771
Jesus Christ.

108
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,878
What?

109
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,753
Listen.

110
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,349
I don't hear anything. What is it?

111
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,227
That was the Power
of Rap, 102.2 F.M.

112
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,302
Radio stations are down.

113
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,360
I can't believe it.

114
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,599
What?

115
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,101
It finally happens and I'm
stuck in a fucking elevator...

116
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,712
with you.

117
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,379
You.

118
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,593
Captain.

119
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,693
- What's the update?
- There's gonna be a short delay

120
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,362
before we can get you out, ma'am.

121
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,298
Why? What's going on? Why are
the phones down, the radios?

122
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,134
I don't have that
information right now.

123
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,146
As soon as I do, I will
pass it on, ma'am.

124
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,705
You need to remain calm.

125
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,707
We're doing everything we can.

126
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,442
This is unacceptable.
Who is in charge?

127
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,944
We'll contact you shortly.

128
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,679
Blau...

129
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,418
shit.

130
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,573
All I could think about was Lauren.

131
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:36,018
Her dad died before she was
even born and I'm all she has.

132
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,247
I think the only reason I
survived being tortured

133
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,682
was to get back to her.

134
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,696
And then I got back to her and
then I endangered her life.

135
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,490
There was just a night where
I ended up waking up,

136
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,693
standing in the middle...
of the street

137
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:59,139
with cars passing, and
holding her and screaming.

138
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,567
And I woke up while I was
holding her and screaming

139
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,148
and I didn't know how I got there.

140
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,627
You hear that?

141
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,256
You mean the game?

142
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,564
Turn that off.

143
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,772
Hey, I said turn it off.

144
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,878
I said, fucking turn it off.

145
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,692
Listen.

146
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,588
Hello.

147
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,124
What's going on out there?

148
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,193
We're still trying to locate
the maintenance team, Captain.

149
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,761
No, what is going on outside?

150
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,863
We hear people panicked,
people shouting.

151
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,032
Available personnel must assemble

152
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,435
at the calling point
in parking lot C.

153
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,805
We are soldiers, for Christ's
sake. We can handle it.

154
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,807
Please, ma'am, you
need to be patient.

155
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,809
No, you need to tell
us what's going on.

156
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,011
What gives you the right
to keep it from us?

157
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,247
Yes, ma'am, you'll be out of there
soon. We haven't forgotten you.

158
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,760
We're doing our best.

159
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,169
What?

160
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,268
She knows more than she's
telling us. Did you hear all that?

161
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,440
They'll figure it out.
They'll get us out of here.

162
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,479
Do you know something
that we don't, Sergeant?

163
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,560
This had to happen.

164
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,518
It's always "when," not "if."

165
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,086
it seems that "when" is now.

166
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,088
What are you talking about?

167
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,857
This.

168
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,259
Them out there.

169
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,340
Who?

170
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,177
Well...

171
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,251
Thanks for the insight.

172
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,816
I think texts are working.

173
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,729
Come on. Come on.

174
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,896
Come on.

175
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,285
Everything okay, ma'am?

176
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,782
Stop breathing like that.

177
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,585
Ma'am.

178
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,791
Stop breathing like that.

179
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,593
Stop it!

180
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,595
- Stop fucking breathing!
- Sir.

181
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,297
Don't you fucking touch me.

182
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,309
I respectfully request
that you calm down.

183
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,582
You need to see this.

184
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,618
The breaking news here

185
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,655
is that a series of explosions
have hit Washington, DC.

186
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,091
I'm here on the ground and this is
still a dangerous situation here.

187
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,861
No one knows if any more
bombs are going to go off.

188
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,529
I'm speaking to you on a sat phone

189
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,033
because some kind of
electromagnetic pulse explosion

190
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,868
has taken out our camera feed

191
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,104
along with other electronic
systems in a five-mile radius.

192
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:11,108
I can see in the distance right
now several plumes of smoke.

193
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,711
Those are located, as you
can see in this footage,

194
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,513
right near the Capitol Building.

195
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,015
Homeland Security is saying
the real threat here

196
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:22,220
is not those bombs but another one
that went off a few miles from here

197
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,055
in Brooklines, Maryland.

198
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,790
They're saying that bomb contained

199
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,227
radioactive material...
a so-called dirty bomb...

200
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,196
and the radiation cloud is
heading right this way.

201
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,832
So we're going to have to
move out at any moment.

202
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,734
Civilians are evacuating

203
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,839
and heavy traffic is already building
on routes out of the city...

204
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,121
Let's talk a bit about
everything that happened.

205
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:02,360
Are there some specific incidents
that trouble you more than others?

206
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,562
Uh, a few of the sergeants...
staff sergeant

207
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:08,165
was in the front... the front...
the first Humvee.

208
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,834
And we were in the second...

209
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,704
me and my best buddy Pete.

210
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,407
It gets hit with an RPG, just bam!

211
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,409
And it... it tips over.

212
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,812
And evidently there might have been,
like, an IED in the road as well.

213
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,814
And the shrapnel shot up and...

214
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,816
and what I think
happened is that it...

215
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,185
it hit the staff sergeant
and just took him out.

216
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:32,857
I was the next one in
line, so I got out.

217
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,159
A bunch of us got out... Pete.

218
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,264
And we decided to try
to get the survivors,

219
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,033
if there were any survivors, out.

220
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,169
And as we got up there,
they started shooting.

221
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,251
And pretty much they were all...
they were shooting from afar.

222
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,477
Answer, God damn it.

223
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,846
Yes, ma'am, we hear you.
Captain, can you please calm...?

224
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,415
Do not tell me to calm down.

225
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,283
We know what's going on out
there. You are gonna tell us

226
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,824
how you're getting us out of here
and when. You understand me?

227
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,523
Captain, we've been informed

228
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,825
that a series of bombs
have hit the city.

229
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:13,130
And we have reason to believe
that one of them is a dirty bomb.

230
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,334
Now we're waiting for an
update on wind direction

231
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,136
and projected path of
the radiation cloud.

232
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,039
But the city is being evacuated.

233
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,875
Ma'am, we really need
to get out of here.

234
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,877
I know, but we've not
been able to locate

235
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,046
the maintenance team responsible
for the elevators yet.

236
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,353
But we are still trying.

237
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,318
Where the hell are they?

238
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,121
We don't know, but I will
continue to try to locate them,

239
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,123
and then we can get
you out, Captain.

240
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,602
Okay, come back to us
as soon as you can.

241
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,427
You need to get out
of here too, right?

242
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,806
My room mate Pete...

243
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,975
he won't understand
what's going on.

244
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:02,513
He had a piece of
shrapnel from an IED.

245
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,890
You know, about like yea big.

246
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,286
You taking care of him?

247
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,689
He ain't got no family,
so I've been...

248
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,566
I've been looking after him,
you know, since we got back.

249
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,941
It'll be okay. We'll get them safe.

250
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:29,117
Whoa, Distinguished Service Cross.

251
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,311
You should be proud, soldier.

252
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,619
It's nothing.

253
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,975
- Hey, you need to get a message out?
- That's okay.

254
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,579
Come on, maybe someone
can go get him.

255
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,836
Calm down, Sergeant.

256
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,261
Hey, anyone there?

257
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,263
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,243
Captain, the building
is being evacuated.

259
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,704
- What do you mean?
- The wind, ma'am. It's...

260
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,876
it's blowing the
radiation this way.

261
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,611
What... what about the maintenance
engineers? Where are they?

262
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,746
They left the building
some time ago.

263
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,748
They're civilians.

264
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,685
Captain, I... I'm afraid we've
been told to move out as well.

265
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,220
You're leaving us here?

266
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,288
We have no choice, ma'am.

267
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,923
Wait, there's gotta be
something you can do.

268
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,226
And I have orders for
you from AMC, ma'am.

269
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,994
Stay where you are.

270
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,029
A rescue squad from J-corps

271
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,031
will come and get you
as soon as they can.

272
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,366
How long?

273
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,235
We don't know for sure, Captain.

274
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:08,072
But if the wind keeps blowing,
it could be safe in 48 hours.

275
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,641
- We'll be dead by then.
- No, ma'am.

276
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,880
No.

277
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,447
Listen, um...

278
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,983
do you have children?

279
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,385
- Captain?
- I said, do you have children?

280
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,088
Oh, Jesus Christ.

281
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,390
You wouldn't understand.
You don't have any.

282
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,266
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,897
My daughter... she's missing.
She's six years old.

284
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,444
I need to get out of
here and get her safe.

285
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,838
I'm sorry, ma'am, but there's
really nothing I can do.

286
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,107
If you give me her
name, maybe I can...

287
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,814
Lauren White, 674 Westbrook
Drive, Annapolis.

288
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,849
And there's a wounded vet that needs
help to be evacuated. Come on.

289
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,352
Pete Laker, 9920 Millchurch
Avenue, apartment C.

290
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,121
I'm sorry.

291
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,423
Listen, if you can't get to them,
you fucking get us out of here

292
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,425
so we can do something
about it, okay? Anything.

293
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,260
Ma'am, there's got to
be some other way.

294
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,929
Hold on.

295
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,637
Come on. Come on.

296
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,810
Okay, I found a
maintenance handbook.

297
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,846
Okay, all right.

298
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,722
Just give me a minute, ma'am.

299
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,355
She was right about one thing.

300
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,456
We won't be dead
when they get here.

301
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,661
Really? Why not?

302
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,327
It takes weeks to die of radiation.

303
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,771
Fuck you.

304
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,435
- What are you doing?
- Conserving power

305
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,170
so we can contact the rescue team.

306
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,706
Don't you want to get out of here?

307
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,674
I'm a soldier.

308
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,755
I follow orders.

309
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,895
All right, come on.

310
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,866
Captain, I have something here.

311
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,668
Okay, what?

312
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,503
I've been through the manual.

313
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,071
There's one way maybe
you could get out.

314
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,740
What? What do we do?
How do we do it?

315
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,508
Ma'am, if you can get onto the roof

316
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,044
of the elevator, there's
a master control panel.

317
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,848
It says here there's a button
marked "safe-mode descent."

318
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,685
If you hit that, it should lower
the car down to ground level.

319
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,121
Safe-mode descent. Thank you.

320
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,956
- Good luck, ma'am.
- Wait.

321
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,958
How long before the radiation hits?

322
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,494
Uh...

323
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,804
best estimate... 10 minutes.

324
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,247
- Come on, let's get this open.
- No!

325
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,249
Our orders are to stay
put in this elevator

326
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,091
until J-corps comes and gets us.

327
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,088
They will come.

328
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,556
You'll see.

329
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,958
No one gets left behind,

330
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,493
not even you.

331
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,662
No one gets left behind.

332
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,432
You might believe everything
you're told, but I do not.

333
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,701
Listen. You hear that?

334
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,536
That is the ventilation system.

335
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,005
In 10 minutes that ventilation
system will be pumping

336
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,007
radiation into this building
and then into this elevator.

337
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,476
If you want to stick around
for that, that's up to you.

338
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,645
I need to get to my
daughter and get her safe.

339
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,082
And if that means risking the radiation,
I will take my fucking chances.

340
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,651
You with me, Private?

341
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,732
- Let's get out of here, ma'am.
- Let's go.

342
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,691
Get on your feet, Private!

343
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,430
Diego, stop!

344
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,363
I am your superior officer.
I order you to sit down

345
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,365
and stay out of our way.

346
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,035
You are no superior officer.

347
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,471
You are showing disrespect
to that fucking uniform

348
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,972
just by wearing it...

349
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,053
ma'am.

350
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,319
All right, Private,
I got your back.

351
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,861
No one gets left behind.

352
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,830
What the hell?

353
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,580
You hear that?

354
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,246
"We're fighting our enemy in
Iraq and Afghanistan today

355
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,448
so we will not have
to meet him again

356
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,917
on our streets,

357
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,588
in our cities."

358
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,525
George W., 2003.

359
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,040
I guess that didn't work.

360
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,682
I was ordered to drop a bomb
and I dropped the bomb.

361
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,442
I'm sure that's not
what's in your report.

362
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,921
Well, where did the bomb land?

363
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,058
I don't miss.

364
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,665
What did you hit?

365
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,573
It...

366
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,344
it hit women and children.

367
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,753
It says here you were
told to abort the attack.

368
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,550
Someone's covering their ass and
the shit's rolling downhill.

369
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,995
And look's who's holding
the fucking bag.

370
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,606
- What the fuck?
- What is this?

371
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,277
Let's go, let's go.
Let's do it, come on.

372
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,975
Excuse me, sir.

373
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,953
Oldsman.

374
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,514
Oldsman, please.

375
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,451
It's a word you like a
lot, isn't it, Captain...

376
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,553
"please"?

377
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,124
I don't know what you're talking
about. Get the fuck out of the way.

378
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,099
- Want some help?
- Yeah.

379
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,646
- You got it?
- Yeah.

380
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,551
Motherfucker!

381
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,291
- Captain.
- All right, let's go.

382
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,998
We were ordered to
stay in the elevator.

383
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,607
You got it?

384
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,299
Nine screws, but they're loose.

385
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,301
I can do it, ma'am.

386
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,037
You cover that wound and if you
don't have a fucking screwdriver,

387
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,708
shut the fuck up.

388
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,054
I know who the fuck you are.

389
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,599
Please please please,
I'll do anything.

390
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,475
I'll do anything.

391
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,675
Death to America!

392
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,677
You listen to me,
Private. She is nothing.

393
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,347
She is no officer.
You open that hatch...

394
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,716
you're gonna let radiation
in, so stop it now.

395
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,797
And that is a fucking order.

396
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,959
- Are you ignoring me, Private?
- Yes, I am, sir.

397
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,593
That took about a minute.
You get the rest out that fast,

398
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,996
it's gonna take about eight.
The radiation hits in five.

399
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,998
- You do the fucking math!
- Good point.

400
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,266
Diego, help me.

401
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,677
All right.

402
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,974
If you think that hatch
is gonna save you,

403
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,850
you can close it as
soon as we're out.

404
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,980
Jesus Christ.

405
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,216
What do you plan on doing
with that knife, Sergeant?

406
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,084
Radiation from a dirty bomb

407
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,589
is carried by the dust cloud
created by the explosion.

408
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,761
Avoid inhalation at all costs.

409
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,872
If you keep it out of the lungs, you
keep it out of the blood stream.

410
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,668
Get off of me!

411
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,138
Diego, stand down! I got this.

412
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,140
Get back up there.

413
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,510
You know how I know
who you are, huh?

414
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,512
I saw the video.

415
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,981
I know why you're here.
You're crazy.

416
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,251
And I bet you're crazy too. You
gotta be, doing what she says.

417
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,987
- What about you, sir? Are you crazy?
- Yeah, I thought so.

418
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,989
But now I think I'm the
only sane one here.

419
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,825
- We're so close.
- I mean, look at you.

420
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,660
- Don't touch me.
- Two fucking crazies...

421
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,429
- Don't fucking touch me!
- ...opening up the hatch

422
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,397
- just to let the radiation in.
- Give those back.

423
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,367
- And the prize... crazy pills.
- Give them back!

424
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,369
- Give them back.
- Who wants one?

425
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,938
Are you gonna beg like you
did in the video, huh?

426
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,873
Jesus Christ, what's
fucking wrong with you?

427
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,875
We don't got time for this shit!

428
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,644
- You got it? Okay.
- Yeah, almost.

429
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,213
- All right.
- Orders are fucking orders!

430
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,486
All right.

431
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,065
- You okay?
- Yeah.

432
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,837
- Ma'am, do you see anything?
- I might have something.

433
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,498
- It won't open.
- You got one fucking minute.

434
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,875
Take as long as you need, Captain.

435
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,617
- I found it.
- Yes!

436
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,385
Whoo!

437
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,521
You guys ready to go down?

438
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,499
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

439
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,148
Ma'am, what's going on?
Why has it stopped?

440
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,583
- I don't know.
- What's happening?

441
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,254
Are we down?

442
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,763
- Fuck!
- Ma'am, are you all right?

443
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,467
Avoid inhalation at all costs.

444
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,847
Ma'am.

445
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,681
Then Pete, you know, he...

446
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,184
he didn't want to get out
of the car, but I said,

447
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,486
"Pete, come on, we gotta get out
of the car. We gotta go right now.

448
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,688
We gotta go right now.
The shit's hitting the fan."

449
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,458
And... I made Pete
get out of the car.

450
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,062
I made Pete get out
of the Humvee and...

451
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,143
But you got a medal
for what you did.

452
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,036
We just follow orders. We just...

453
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,707
we just follow orders.

454
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,684
Ma'am, what's happening?

455
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,765
What's going on?

456
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,746
Shit.

457
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,186
Shit.

458
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,748
Coming down.

459
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,692
- Radiation.
- Oh, shit.

460
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,299
- Diego, get the hatch.
- Hold your breath!

461
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,226
- Cover your mouth.
- You got it?

462
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,069
- Cover your mouth.
- Cover your mouth. Cover your mouth.

463
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,142
Oh fuck.

464
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,896
Oh my God, do you think the
dust cloud has passed?

465
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,500
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get those doors open.

466
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,384
It's clear, ma'am.

467
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:13,016
What kind of reception have you
had in the army since returning,

468
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:18,230
given the extraordinary
circumstances of your capture?

469
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,538
I kind of try not
to think about it.

470
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,684
We were ordered to stay put.

471
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,923
You disobeyed that order.

472
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,234
And you got us all killed.

473
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,717
Might as well die happy, right?

474
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,954
How long till event 12?

475
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,001
A little over three minutes.

476
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,033
We're okay.

477
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,643
Let me...

478
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,350
let me see if I can get
this thing going again.

479
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,174
You know what's funny?

480
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,291
You killed me.

481
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,519
You killed me.

482
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,730
Killed by a traitor.

483
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,099
A dirty traitor bitch.

484
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,741
You would understand
if you had a child.

485
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:11,264
You should have kept
one for yourself.

486
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,201
You should have kept a bullet

487
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,604
for yourself.

488
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,775
I did.

489
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,015
I couldn't leave her.

490
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,921
So fuck you.

491
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,779
What would you know about war?

492
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,258
You've never even been in battle.

493
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,619
I read your file.

494
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,621
You sat on your ass in Texas

495
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,990
and you pushed a button
like it was a videogame.

496
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,426
You aimed that Predator
missile right in that crowd,

497
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,529
16 innocent women and children,

498
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,136
when you were ordered to abort.

499
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,214
Well, you really want
to know the truth?

500
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,844
I don't regret it.

501
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:11,483
'Cause there ain't no such
thing as innocence over there.

502
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,260
You're a fucking piece of shit.

503
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,362
Look at me.

504
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,534
All right, we have to stop this.
Let's get him out of there.

505
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,615
- Bring it back up.
- Okay.

506
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,913
- I can't do it.
- What do you mean you can't do it?

507
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,848
It's not going through.
It's on automatic.

508
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,650
I told the systems guys
there had to be overrides.

509
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:48,991
I guess they weren't listening.

510
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,828
Get off, get off!

511
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,798
- Oh my God, event 12.
- How long does it last?

512
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,971
About, uh, 30 seconds.

513
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,552
Oh, wait wait. I know
a way around this.

514
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,122
Um, abort codes in Section 10...

515
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,924
- pull them up.
- I'm already on it.

516
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,698
Let's start shutting this down.

517
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,197
I'm on it.

518
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,278
She's going into shock.

519
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,172
The sight of blood...
it's... it's her trigger.

520
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,809
It's... it's what sets her off.

521
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,655
My God, is she helping him?

522
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,221
She broke through it.

523
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,563
I'm sorry. I...

524
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,571
What?

525
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,343
Pete?

526
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:49,105
9920 Millchurch
Avenue, apartment C.

527
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,974
I got it, I got it. I'll get him.

528
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,110
I'll find him. I'll find him.

529
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,312
Oh, God.

530
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,614
You know what?

531
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,491
Take some breaths.
Just try to get some air.

532
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,792
I can't do anything. I can't.

533
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,272
If I pull it out,
it'll kill you. I...

534
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,675
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

535
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,273
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

536
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,605
We need to call General Black.

537
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,419
Oh, God.

538
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,896
Motherfucker! You bitch!

539
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,085
Oh, God.

540
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,258
You'd better watch your step, Cap.

541
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,432
Stupid bitch.

542
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,293
Okay, found them... the
first set of abort codes.

543
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:02,842
Delta, foxtrot, numeral
three, alpha, uniform, delta.

544
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,769
Okay, now yours.

545
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:11,813
Alpha, kilo, numeral six,
sierra, tango, delta.

546
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,048
Sierra, tango, delta.

547
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,761
Are you hearing me?

548
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:25,494
I just... I need to
think this through.

549
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,416
Hey!

550
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,074
Is anybody in there?

551
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,909
Help us!

552
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,412
- Please help us.
- Dr. Andrews.

553
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,493
- What are you doing?
- Help me.

554
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,684
She's on the roof. She's safe.

555
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,354
Are you serious? Protocol says

556
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,890
we abort if any participant
is in mortal danger.

557
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,193
A man just bled out. Isn't that
the definition of mortal danger?

558
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,706
Well, there's nothing we
can do for Diego now.

559
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:12,069
We can use this.
It's the ultimate test.

560
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,550
Lieutenant, would you pull
up some background files?

561
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:04,222
I need to see if there's
something we've missed.

562
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,596
Will do.

563
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,702
Hey, Captain.

564
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,502
Help yourself.

565
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,913
You must need one by now.

566
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:53,195
White has performed
incredibly well.

567
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,699
You wanted battlefield testing,
General. You just got it.

568
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,535
Sir, a man is dead.

569
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,513
This incident is a tragedy.

570
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,074
Private Diego was a hero.

571
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:09,311
We're going to need some time to
work out the best way forward.

572
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,586
Until then, you should
continue the trial.

573
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,151
General,

574
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:20,055
if we don't stop this right now,

575
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,924
I am walking

576
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,760
and will file a formal
complaint with AMC HQ.

577
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,930
This is crazy. We'll all
end up court-martialed.

578
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,566
This is about more than
three soldiers, lieutenant.

579
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,568
We're at war.

580
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,503
On two fronts.

581
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,505
More of our soldiers

582
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,174
are committing suicide
than are killed in combat.

583
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:42,678
Post-traumatic stress is
now our greatest enemy.

584
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,947
But a line has been crossed.

585
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,548
Enough.

586
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,418
Lieutenant Blau, permission
to leave granted.

587
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,687
I want your full
report on this matter?

588
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,222
While it's fresh in your mind.

589
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:56,202
Report to Major Whitcomb
at Jackson immediately.

590
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,475
Yes, sir.

591
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:12,941
I don't see how removing
Blau helps us, general.

592
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:16,178
This shitstorm you've created
needs to be dealt with.

593
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:19,682
And Blau doesn't have
the stomach for it.

594
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:24,920
This drug has to be on the
front line in three weeks.

595
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,122
You say you're a patriot?

596
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:31,262
Well, today you're
going to prove it.

597
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,529
Help!

598
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,610
Can you hear us?

599
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,646
Somebody fucking help us.

600
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,831
Want your pills pretty
bad, don't you?

601
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,206
Fuck you, motherfucker.

602
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,199
Dr. Andrews.

603
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,034
Where are you?

604
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,241
In my car, at the gate
on my way to debrief.

605
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:14,543
Where... where's your
escort Major Cortez?

606
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:17,045
He never showed up.

607
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,982
I found the emails about
the side effects.

608
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,284
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

609
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,653
Those are rare and
they're not proven.

610
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:29,024
You say here one in 100 patients
experience severe side effects.

611
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,127
It appears to intensify their
post-traumatic stress,

612
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,696
makes them psychotic,
just like Oldsman.

613
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,466
Possibly, but we need more data.

614
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,334
That's why we're doing this.

615
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:42,348
Even if it is true,
it can be managed.

616
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,035
Fuck.

617
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,274
Whoa.

618
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,689
All right.

619
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,736
Hey.

620
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,502
Need some help?

621
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,314
Maybe you want some of mine?

622
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,247
No?

623
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:04,524
Maybe you want one of his.

624
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,963
Diego's.

625
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,627
Maybe we don't need any at all,

626
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:15,868
because our insides are disintegrating
with fucking radiation!

627
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,483
Where are you going?

628
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,752
J-corps is coming.

629
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,154
Come down.

630
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,326
I won't hurt you.

631
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:03,310
You're never gonna make
it, not even close.

632
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:11,786
If you fall from up there,
it's going to hurt even worse.

633
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,301
This is why you fucking
follow orders!

634
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:08,939
You follow orders!

635
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,592
All right.

636
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,884
Motherfucker.

637
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,896
You fucking set me up?

638
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:36,463
I found one of those cameras
in my fucking house.

639
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,741
You filming me to get me put away?

640
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:45,012
Fuck you!

641
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,830
General, we have to stop this.

642
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,832
You're a doctor.
You want to save lives.

643
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,201
That's why you're
doing this, right?

644
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,670
Here's something they don't
teach you in med school,

645
01:07:55,671 --> 01:08:00,075
something I learned on the
battlefield written in blood:

646
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,812
Saving lives costs lives.

647
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:05,980
Have you seen the news?

648
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:10,351
We've got a serious problem here...
suicide rates off the scale,

649
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,654
tens of thousands
off active service,

650
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:16,291
all thanks to post-traumatic
fucking stress.

651
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,100
In a couple of years there will
be no one left to fight...

652
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:24,700
just a parade of
traumatized crybabies.

653
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:28,081
They need this.

654
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,482
The army needs this.

655
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,118
America needs this.

656
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:41,992
Once those survivors get out,
the whole thing's blown.

657
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,156
How many events in your trial?

658
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,635
14.

659
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,708
As of now, we're at 15.

660
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,868
Event 15 will be

661
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,337
an accident...

662
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,340
a tragic fatal

663
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,852
elevator accident.

664
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,126
I wish there was another way.

665
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,154
What... what about Lieutenant Blau?

666
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,394
Stick to what you know, Doctor.

667
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:31,645
I've cleared the building,
now get the fuck on with it.

668
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,893
You are all traitors.

669
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,395
You're all fucking traitors!

670
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,634
Oh, fuck.

671
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,713
You remember the code, Captain?

672
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:53,381
I am an American fighting in
the Force to guard my country

673
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:58,786
and our way of life. I am prepared
to give my life in their defense.

674
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:01,800
I will never surrender
of my own free will.

675
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:09,197
And if in command, I will never
surrender the members of my command

676
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,507
while there is still
means to resist.

677
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:20,216
If captured, I will continue to
resist by all means available.

678
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,945
I will make every effort to escape.

679
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,219
I will aid others to escape.

680
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:33,688
I will never accept parole or special
favors from the fucking enemy,

681
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,769
you stupid fucking bitch!

682
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,341
I will never betray my country...

683
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,247
even if my country betrays me.

684
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,422
Is anybody there?

685
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,503
Hello?

686
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:49,065
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

687
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,467
Dr. Andrews?

688
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,548
Is that you?

689
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,448
I'm... I'm so sorry.

690
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,351
Why aren't you helping us?

691
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,160
You're a doctor.

692
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:11,455
You took an oath to help people.

693
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,735
Not to kill them.

694
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:27,868
How do you feel about being part
of a trial for this medication?

695
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,672
I'm not here by choice.

696
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,035
I was told this is
what I had to do.

697
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,471
I was ordered to do this.

698
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,075
I follow orders.

699
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:45,046
I mean, if you asked
me to be a part

700
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:49,617
in an experimental
trial drug or whatever

701
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:52,858
a few months ago, I probably
would have said no.

702
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,424
But, like, now I would
just do anything.

703
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:59,360
I just want it to be...
I want to be normal again.

704
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,762
I just want to be able
to be a mom to my kid.

705
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:06,879
And I want to feel like
I can do my job again.

706
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,411
Andrews.

707
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,970
Sir, I hold you
personally responsible

708
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,449
for the deaths that
occurred here today.

709
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:37,878
I have right here a complete
record of what happened.

710
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:41,716
I will make sure that by the end
of today you will be in custody.

711
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,785
Put me through to Lambro security.

712
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:49,190
I understand you're unhappy about
what has happened here, Captain,

713
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:50,825
but everything we are doing

714
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,260
is for the safety and
security of this country.

715
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:56,430
If you do this, you're a traitor.

716
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:58,632
I'm sure by now you've
called security.

717
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:03,477
But that's okay, because by the
time they get here, I will be gone.

718
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:08,275
What you're watching is a
recording made over an hour ago.

719
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:12,880
Right now I'm at the news
desk of a major newspaper

720
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:16,884
or at the DA's office
or the police station

721
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:22,256
or a freedom of information
group, I haven't decided yet.

722
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,692
You crossed the line.

723
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,694
Diego and Oldsman were soldiers.

724
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,396
They willingly offered their
lives for this country.

725
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:32,700
And in return you
experimented on them

726
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,503
and killed them like lab rats.

727
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:38,551
I'm doing this to make sure that
they haven't died for nothing.

728
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,188
When this goes public...

729
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,213
maybe then the military
will treat its veterans

730
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:49,992
with the respect
they deserve. Good-bye.
