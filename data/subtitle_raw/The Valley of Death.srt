1
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,520
Come on

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,240
Is this your horse?

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,680
No...

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
Whose is it then? Speak

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,360
It's mine

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,680
It's mine now

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm not selling

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm buying, who dares decline

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,720
I have something more valuable
than a horse

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
...but I doubt if you can get it

11
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,160
Hero

12
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,600
Take me as your pupil

13
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,600
What are you doing?

14
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
I want you to be my teacher

15
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,080
and teach me a few moves

16
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,040
Get up

17
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
Little brother, I'm so young

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,280
How can I take a pupil?

19
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,720
I'm not getting up

20
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,600
...unless you agree

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,400
Teach me

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,560
I'll serve you forever

23
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,080
Stop fooling around

24
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,040
Get up

25
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Hero

26
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,880
I am a good man

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,760
I have no family to worry about

28
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,800
I won't give you any trouble

29
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,080
...if you take me as your pupil

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,240
No, I can't take a pupil

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
This is their silver

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,880
You help me to bury them properly

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,680
You want to bury them?

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,480
I can't let them just lie here

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,520
Do you know

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,560
...whom you have killed?

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't care, just bury them

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
What a fool!

39
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
He wants to bury the silver

40
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,000
Good...

41
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,480
No, I'm still a long way off

42
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,880
But you are not bad

43
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,880
You just lack focus

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Remember

45
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,640
the trick is speed and accuracy

46
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,680
Eyes, hands and intent should be one

47
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,680
Yes

48
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,240
Lam Hung, show me what you've learnt

49
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,600
on the 18 sword styles with your juniors

50
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,840
Yes. Come

51
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,400
Please

52
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Stop

53
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
Lam Hung

54
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,600
Two of your moves weren't powerful enough

55
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,680
You left yourself wide open

56
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,920
This sword style...

57
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
is not a dead form

58
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,240
The more enemies there are

59
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,560
the more powerful it will be

60
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,240
You must use it flexibly

61
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,400
It could be used round and round

62
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,880
and spin off into many techniques

63
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,680
Yes, I'm sorry

64
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,920
Stand and watch

65
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,760
Come, let's exchange a few moves

66
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,680
More men

67
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,560
A few more

68
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,480
Good...

69
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,120
Get up...

70
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,040
Practise more

71
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,920
Yes

72
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
Master Chiu, these few moves are real good

73
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
You're too kind

74
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,040
It all can't yet match your
San He sword style

75
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
You're too kind

76
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,160
Nanny, allow me

77
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
Uncle, your tea

78
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,960
Thanks

79
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Aunt Jin, clean up the guest room

80
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,240
Put up some clean sheets

81
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Who's coming?

82
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
Your second uncle's son

83
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,240
Brother Yu Lung will arrive in
these 2 days

84
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,480
Why is he coming all of a sudden?

85
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
I invited him

86
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,240
I hear his kung fu is quite good

87
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
You haven't seen it

88
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,240
When he arrives I'll

89
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,720
...ask him to demonstrate

90
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
That's good

91
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,760
How long is he staying?

92
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,160
He'll be here

93
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,320
I am getting old

94
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,600
and he will take over my affairs

95
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,560
That's good

96
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,240
I have been worrying

97
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,040
I thought you might hand over the affairs

98
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,640
...to me

99
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,280
It's not that I don't want to do that

100
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,240
You are after all a girl

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,960
That's a fact

102
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,640
What do I know?

103
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,840
It's good that Yu Lung

104
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,520
...can come

105
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,040
I can learn kung fu from him

106
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,000
and we'll have fun

107
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,400
Look at you

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,960
However, he's new here

109
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,120
so you must guide him

110
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,960
Don't worry. He's my brother

111
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,120
I'll tell him

112
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
...all that I know

113
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,080
Right

114
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll ask Brother Lau to teach me
San He sword style

115
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,800
Alright

116
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Wait for me at the usual place

117
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,920
Brother Lau, teach me few moves

118
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,320
Miss, your swordsmanship is already
very good

119
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Why ask me?

120
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,280
Stop being evasive,

121
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,640
if you don't want to teach just say it

122
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,560
It's not like that

123
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,120
Alright then, let's fence

124
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
Please

125
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,440
Brother, you should make some
allowance for me

126
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,840
Sorry. Get up

127
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
I'll teach you how to get through
these moves

128
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,600
Brother Lam

129
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,360
How come you've arrived so quickly?

130
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,440
What are you thinking?

131
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,440
About us

132
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,880
You don't believe me?

133
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,320
It's not like that

134
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
I've always thought uncle would hand over

135
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,480
...all his assets to me

136
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,560
Now it's all over

137
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,600
Why?

138
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,400
He said my cousin will be coming

139
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,760
...to take over his affairs

140
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,880
If it's that's the case

141
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,480
...our plans will be nullified

142
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,400
I want you to do something

143
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,360
...dangerous for me

144
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,280
Will you?

145
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
Of course

146
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,680
For you, I fear nothing

147
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,360
The only chance we have now

148
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
...is to kill my uncle

149
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,040
...before Chiu Yu Lung arrives

150
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,800
...at Death Valley

151
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Oh?

152
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,760
You should understand

153
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
When I get the assets

154
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,000
...it will be yours as well

155
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,960
I know

156
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,880
What? Infirm of purpose?

157
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,800
No

158
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,800
How could my skills enable me
to fight teacher?

159
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,560
We'll do it together

160
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,080
It's not going to be done openly

161
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,040
We'll ambush him

162
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,080
It's not easy too

163
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,960
Don't forget Lau is always protecting him

164
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,200
We'll bribe him

165
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,840
Lau is no fool

166
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,080
Will he do it?

167
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,120
Don't worry

168
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,840
Let me handle him

169
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,880
The question is whether you're willing?

170
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,160
You needn't ask

171
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,360
For you, I'll do anything

172
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,920
Good, just listen to me

173
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,240
I have my plans

174
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,240
Intoxicating incense?

175
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,160
There's an assassin!

176
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
Yuen Hawk, help

177
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Yuen Hawk

178
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,280
You must write it

179
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,760
...so that he'll come urgently

180
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,480
I didn't expect master

181
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,920
...would be killed like this

182
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,920
We are inadequate

183
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,240
...and must solicit Jin Fu's help

184
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,120
Nanny

185
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,160
If Jin Fu could avenge uncle's death
for me

186
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,600
I'll be grateful to you all my life

187
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,560
Miss, don't mention it

188
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
See, is this alright?

189
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,160
Thank you

190
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,520
You...

191
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,760
What?

192
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,240
Why did you kill her?

193
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
I don't need her as my nanny any more

194
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,280
Though I've always loved you

195
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,400
I've never dreamt such a day would come

196
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,200
I won't let you down

197
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,760
Swear it

198
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,360
If I let you down,
I'll die a horrible death

199
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,320
Now you should know

200
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,200
how I feel about you

201
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,880
Are you satisfied?

202
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,800
It'll be light soon. Go quickly

203
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,480
I am reluctant to leave

204
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,320
So am I

205
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,160
But you must go

206
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,520
Yuen Hawk

207
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,000
You can find Jin Fu in Jing Jou county

208
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,480
...at Gau Sing Inn

209
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,640
Give him this letter

210
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
As long as he's willing to come

211
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,560
...we have no fear

212
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,920
...of Chiu Yu Lung

213
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,160
Return soon

214
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,800
...so I wouldn't have to worry

215
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,360
I'll be back soon

216
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
Where is Gau Sing Inn please?

217
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,440
Just over the bridge

218
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,320
Thanks

219
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,240
Does someone called Jin Fu

220
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
...stay here?

221
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,160
I have something urgent for him

222
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,080
He's at the back

223
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,840
In the big room

224
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,880
Who is it?

225
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,680
Lau Yuen Hawk

226
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,320
From Death Valley

227
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,640
Are you hero Jin?

228
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,600
Yes

229
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,160
Please have seat

230
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,040
Thanks

231
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,080
Our benefactor Master of Yue Yang Mansion

232
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
was killed in an ambush by
his bodyguard Lau

233
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,800
He intended to occupy the mansion
and marry Miss Chiu

234
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,360
No one dared go against him
because of his great skill

235
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,640
So I've tricked him to deliver this letter

236
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,400
Here is the bracelet as a token

237
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,080
You kill him at once to prevent
further problems

238
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,840
So you are Lau Yuen Hawk?

239
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,080
Yes. How can I help you?

240
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,760
Excuse me

241
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,240
You take a look

242
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
What?

243
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,160
Who's beating the drum?

244
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,080
Me

245
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,320
Who are you?

246
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,480
The Lone Ranger Er Toe Chi

247
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,400
What's it with the drum?

248
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,240
I want the reward for Snow Five Devils

249
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,520
By you alone?

250
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,080
You killed them all?

251
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,160
The body is out there

252
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,880
Go and see for yourself

253
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,880
Come, men

254
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,400
Yes

255
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,240
Examine their identity

256
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:40,800
Yes

257
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,080
We have examined them

258
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,240
and it is the Snow Five Devils

259
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,480
Pay him

260
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,160
Yes

261
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,440
Stand down

262
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Wait

263
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,440
Quick

264
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,560
I didnt get your name just now

265
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,280
You are...

266
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,840
The Lone Ranger Er Toe Chi, what?

267
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,160
Nothing?

268
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Teacher

269
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,680
Teacher

270
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,120
I've been looking for you everywhere

271
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,200
Don't call me teacher

272
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,800
What do you want with me?

273
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,560
I want to return the silver to you

274
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,040
Consider it yours

275
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
Master Chiu is dead

276
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,440
What?

277
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,040
Lau Yuen Hawk?

278
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,040
Do you know who is Lau?

279
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
No

280
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,080
Look

281
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,720
This man is Jin Fu

282
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,240
Hero Jin, you killed him?

283
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,320
Are you kidding?

284
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,960
I just posted this

285
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,400
The body is at Gau Sing Inn

286
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,400
Get someone to collect it

287
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,040
Yes

288
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,000
Gau Sing Inn

289
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,680
Ten

290
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,160
Don't move

291
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,840
The banker is ten. All win

292
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,560
Earth tile

293
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,520
Open

294
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,080
Nine

295
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,000
One and Six

296
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,240
A pair of three

297
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,840
You've lost again

298
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
Pay up

299
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,960
Yes, yes

300
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,840
Hurry... come

301
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,880
Come, are you defeated?

302
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,880
Come on

303
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,560
Teacher, I've lost everything

304
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,840
Get up, I'll play a few hands for you

305
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,480
Stand aside

306
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,760
Four

307
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,680
Jin Fu, I have no quarrel with you

308
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
what do you mean by this?

309
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,720
As long as I'm here

310
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,640
I won't let you bully others

311
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,520
I am no easy-going fellow either

312
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,320
What if we dare you?

313
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,720
Fight...

314
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,240
Jin Fu

315
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
We have a business here

316
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,840
and you are interfering with us

317
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,640
Okay, we will remember this

318
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,560
Show me what you've got

319
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,880
Let's see

320
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,480
Be careful. Let's go

321
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,360
Go...

322
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,640
Make way

323
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,000
Thank you for your help, I'm so grateful

324
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,720
They're bullies, it's not fair

325
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,480
I am Jin Fu, your name is?

326
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,920
Hero Jin, this is my teacher

327
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,240
Shut up

328
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,440
I am Chiu Yu Lung

329
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,440
Waiter

330
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,320
Master Jin, can I help you?

331
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,200
Bring some wine

332
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,440
I want to drink with my new friend

333
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,480
Yes

334
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,360
A pot of good wine

335
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,000
Teacher, you're great

336
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,040
You've killed so many men

337
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,760
...with only a few strokes

338
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,480
He was drugged

339
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,840
and was almost ambushed

340
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,280
Drugged

341
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,440
Hero, don't attack us

342
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,720
We're the good guys

343
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,960
What do you want?

344
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,120
We're here to see you

345
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,760
If it weren't for teacher

346
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,640
you would have been ambushed

347
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,000
You mightn't believe

348
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,520
Go and take a look

349
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,880
...at the dead bodies out there

350
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,960
What should we do?

351
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,800
They planned to ambush you

352
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,040
and I found out

353
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,600
I'll never forget how you saved me

354
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,240
It's nothing

355
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,760
It's all because of me

356
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,720
I should apologise to you

357
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,440
Let's not stand on ceremony

358
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,440
Please sit

359
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,160
Please

360
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,520
Hero Jin, may I take a look at

361
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,160
...your famous sword?

362
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,600
It's nothing

363
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,560
Take a look

364
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,440
It's really a fine sword!

365
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
You really like it?

366
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Yes, all good swords

367
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,440
...appeal to true martial artists

368
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,320
If you can use a single sword

369
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
I'll make an exchange with you

370
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
I should not take away

371
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,160
...your prized treasure

372
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,640
A good sword ought to be
with a good master

373
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,040
It's okay as long as you like it

374
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,840
Then I'll take it

375
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,600
Buns

376
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,280
Hot buns...

377
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,640
Hot buns

378
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,360
Hot buns...

379
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,440
Money?

380
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
Who's paying?

381
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,640
Who's paying? I have no money

382
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,320
You can't do this

383
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,120
You have to pay

384
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,840
Damn you

385
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,400
I don't have to pay anything

386
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:26,960
No way

387
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,040
You have to pay

388
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,400
Get lost

389
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,640
Sorry sir

390
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,440
It's okay

391
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,920
They are at fault

392
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,360
Where are you from?

393
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,840
None of your business

394
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,800
Why do you bully a kid?

395
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,120
They ate my buns without paying

396
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,360
I love to bully others, so what?

397
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,880
If you kneel and bow to me

398
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
then I might not bully you

399
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
What boastfulness!

400
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Beat him up

401
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,720
You still dare to bully others?

402
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,760
Have mercy

403
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,280
You're not getting off that easily

404
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,400
Money for the buns?

405
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,880
Here

406
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,480
Quick

407
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,440
Yes

408
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,480
I'll kill you

409
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,640
Little brother, here's your money

410
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,720
Go home

411
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,280
If you're bullied

412
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,440
...just tell my teacher

413
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,200
Thanks, thank you

414
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,560
It's okay

415
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,560
Go home now

416
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,760
Thanks

417
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,800
Let's take up lodging here

418
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,960
"Yue Lai Inn"

419
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,480
Boss, is there a clean room?

420
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,840
Yes

421
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Hero Jin

422
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,000
The best room has been reserved for you

423
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,200
This is from Jien Ying of
the Chiu residence

424
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,440
...for you

425
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,760
She said to go see her with this

426
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,480
My teacher is not...

427
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,240
Alright

428
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Let me rest a while

429
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,880
Yes

430
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,480
Siu San

431
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,840
Coming

432
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,760
Take them to the best room

433
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,440
Yes

434
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,680
Please follow me

435
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,760
Little Tiger

436
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,760
Coming...

437
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,960
Quick

438
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,800
Ride at once to master Lam

439
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,840
...tell him Jin has arrived

440
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,640
Yes

441
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,600
Master Lam, mercy

442
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,800
I want to pay you

443
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,600
but I have no money

444
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,240
Bullshit, I'll kill you if you don't pay

445
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,640
Master Lam, have mercy

446
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,440
When the autumn harvest is ready

447
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,080
I'll pay you what I owe

448
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,440
I bow to you...

449
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,640
No way. I'm not waiting that long

450
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Pay right now

451
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,520
Even if you kill me

452
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,720
I have no money

453
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,920
I'll kill you

454
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,080
Brother, stop please

455
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,320
You'll kill him

456
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,960
Damn you. Shut up

457
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,040
If you want to live, you have to obey me

458
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,040
If you dare to do otherwise

459
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,600
...you'll die

460
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,680
I don't dare

461
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,800
Master Lam...

462
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,360
Jin has arrived in town

463
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,600
Really?

464
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
He's in our inn

465
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,400
Boss Chen has asked me to invite you over

466
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,960
I'll let you off easily today

467
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,240
If you don't pay tomorrow

468
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,520
you'll die

469
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,760
Why don't you take a seat?

470
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,200
I'll serve you first

471
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,880
No, sit, please

472
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,040
This is the rule

473
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,120
I don't have such a rule

474
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,400
We're brothers

475
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,640
If you serve me like this

476
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,080
...don't follow me then

477
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,240
You'd better get lost

478
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,320
I won't

479
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,240
Then sit and eat

480
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,280
What's this?

481
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,160
This was given by uncle

482
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,920
Father said I should look at it each day

483
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,280
when I arise and before meals

484
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,560
It contains the philosophy of life

485
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,440
Philosophy of life?

486
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,080
Let me take a look

487
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,680
This is fun

488
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Same line every day?

489
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,200
Yes

490
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
Aren't you bored?

491
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,280
What do you know, eat up

492
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,960
Master Lam, he's here

493
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,360
What does he look like?

494
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,720
Smart, with a pretty face

495
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,600
Right. No wonder she asked him here

496
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,720
Where is his room?

497
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
The best room

498
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,880
He's having his meal right now

499
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,600
I'll see him

500
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Is there a clean room?

501
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,080
Yes

502
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,880
Your name?

503
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,800
Jin

504
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,360
You're the cold-faced master?

505
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,200
I'm Jin Fu

506
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,520
I am Lam Hung of Chiu residence

507
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,680
Miss Jien has a token for you

508
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,480
Did you get it?

509
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,640
Is this it?

510
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,040
Kill him

511
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,760
Yes

512
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,240
Chase

513
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,320
Please follow me

514
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,440
Wait for me here

515
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,200
Yes

516
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,880
Weren't you looking for me?

517
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,960
You...

518
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,240
What did you want with me?

519
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,480
Something important naturally

520
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,040
You can't let me talk to you

521
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,240
...in the nude

522
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,640
What's the difference?

523
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,480
Go and sit in the living room

524
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,520
I'll be with you

525
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,240
Alright

526
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,160
Come, let me introduce

527
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,920
This is cold-faced hero Jin Fu

528
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,440
Little fellow

529
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,160
you have the nerve to impersonate Jin Fu?

530
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,640
What makes you say that?

531
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,400
Do you know who Jin is to me?

532
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,760
You should do your home work

533
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,360
Jin grew up with me

534
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,400
Can you fool me?

535
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,480
I ask you. What is your treacherous plan?

536
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,520
I was just going to ask you

537
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,080
What you want with Jin Fu?

538
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,520
You love to be a busy body

539
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,400
I'll teach you a lesson

540
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,920
so you'll tell the truth

541
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,360
Attack

542
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,200
Attack

543
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,920
Attack...

544
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,760
Chase...

545
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,600
We must catch him

546
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,040
He is Chiu Yu Lung

547
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
Attack

548
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,840
Attack

549
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,960
He must be Chiu

550
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,640
We must rid him for good

551
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,640
Let's split up and chase

552
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,680
Yes

553
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,160
We searched inside, nothing

554
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,960
Have you seen

555
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,000
...a wounded young man pass here?

556
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,920
No, Master Lam

557
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,720
Bull shit

558
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,000
I saw him come this way

559
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,840
Master Lam, I really haven't seen anyone

560
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,800
No

561
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,160
Master Lam, my dad is telling the truth

562
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,280
Bullshit, if he's not here

563
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,240
has he flown away?

564
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,800
Master, is it you?

565
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,040
Why are you wounded?

566
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,120
I'll take you to my home

567
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,880
Little doggy, have you sold your buns?

568
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,760
Yes

569
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,080
Granny, this gentleman is wounded

570
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,640
Who is it?

571
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,240
It's the master who saved my life
the last time

572
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,520
Oh, it's him

573
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,840
Then help him

574
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,360
...lie down quickly

575
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,560
Doggy, get a cup of hot tea

576
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,760
then bring our home-made medicine

577
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,520
Quickly

578
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,120
Brother Jin

579
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,200
Miss Chiu

580
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,720
Why address me this way?

581
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,440
Call me Jien Ying

582
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,920
Please sit

583
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,000
I thank you for

584
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,000
...avenging my uncle

585
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,960
My mother and I are indebted

586
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,040
...to uncle Chiu; so it is only right

587
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,440
...I avenge his death

588
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,840
I am deeply grateful

589
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,960
You are too kind

590
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,480
Where is my mother now?

591
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,320
I sent her to bring my father
from the south

592
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,960
This place is unattended after uncle
was gone

593
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,840
...so I plan to have my father help out

594
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,000
Also someone has been impersonating as

595
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,400
...my uncle's relative to steal the estate

596
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,400
That's why brother has been brought

597
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,200
...here to help out

598
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,840
I hope you will do me this favour

599
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,400
Do you know who the impersonator is?

600
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,480
I hear his name is Chiu Yu Lung

601
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,000
Chiu Yu Lung?

602
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,640
I hear his kung fu is very good

603
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,840
...and has arrived here

604
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,760
Brother Jin...

605
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,840
you must help me get rid of him

606
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,480
This...

607
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,440
Chiu is not a villain

608
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,720
You know him?

609
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,960
I have a good friend by the same name

610
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,640
and he is no villain

611
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,720
That's him

612
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,240
He stole into the mansion

613
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,960
...into my bower

614
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,600
and peeped at me while I was bathing

615
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,280
He had a sword

616
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,960
and said he was the cold faced Jin Fu

617
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,840
He molested me

618
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,360
Doesn't that make him a villain?

619
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,640
I think you have been misled

620
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,880
Brother Jin

621
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,680
Nanny asks you to help me get rid of him

622
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,440
so everything depends on you

623
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,440
Although a token has been left

624
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,840
and you have requested my help

625
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,960
I still should investigate thoroughly

626
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,920
But he might ambush me

627
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,680
...before you could find out anything

628
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,080
You are wrong

629
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,600
I know him

630
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,160
How could he harm a woman?

631
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,520
I feel anxious day and night

632
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,440
Brother, stay for the time being

633
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,480
No, I'm used to the inn

634
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,800
Master Lam, a toast

635
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,880
A toast to everyone

636
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,800
Drink up

637
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Cheers...

638
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,720
Thank you for coming

639
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,680
...all the way

640
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,440
Don't mention it

641
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,640
We're brothers

642
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,760
Just tell us what you want

643
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,800
I want you to kill someone

644
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,800
That's easy

645
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,760
We can kill

646
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,800
...ten if you like

647
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,640
Two hundred taels of silver for
each of you

648
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,240
I'll reward you more after the job is done

649
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,880
Who do you want killed?

650
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,400
This person is highly skilled

651
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,160
Don't underestimate him

652
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,760
What's his name?

653
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,720
Chiu Yu Lung

654
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,160
Chiu Yu Lung?

655
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,240
Master Chiu, you're awake?

656
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,280
Yes, madam

657
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Wait, the buns are ready soon

658
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,000
No, I have go out for a while

659
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,840
You're still wounded

660
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,920
How can you go out?

661
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,840
No, it's alright. I'm fine

662
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,120
It's here

663
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,520
Master, look who's here?

664
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,800
Brother

665
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,960
where have you been these two days?

666
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,160
You don't know

667
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,040
I was almost caught

668
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,840
I hide in a small valley with two horses

669
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,320
and dared not come out

670
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,080
I had no food for two days

671
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,520
Little doggy, hide the horses

672
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,680
Don't let anyone see them

673
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,840
The Chiu mansion guys are looking for you

674
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,920
I know

675
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,840
Eat a good meal tonight

676
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,280
I'll bring you to a place

677
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,720
Where?

678
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,640
Chiu Mansion

679
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,920
Chiu Mansion?

680
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,520
Halt

681
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,480
Who is it?

682
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,400
Hero Chiu Yu Lung

683
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,800
Chiu Yu Lung?

684
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,000
Chase

685
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,280
Chase him...

686
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,240
Brother Jin, please sit

687
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,880
What, have you not found Chiu yet?

688
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,440
Is he really here?

689
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,000
How come he hasn't shown up?

690
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,120
He's here

691
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,680
Who knows where he is hiding!

692
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,280
You must help me find him

693
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,360
As long as he lives

694
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,000
...I'm in danger

695
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:55,320
Brother, I'll do anything you want so long

696
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,320
...as you kill him

697
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,080
I'll give you anything you want

698
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,600
Miss, I'll depart if there's nothing else

699
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,880
Why do you address me like this again?

700
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,880
Don't you want to stay here longer?

701
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,840
It's late

702
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,440
We were closer when we were kids

703
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,480
Why is there a distance between us now?

704
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:24,880
Good bye

705
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,040
No matter what you do to harm me

706
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,880
...you're still my sister

707
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,760
I won't kill you

708
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,600
Who are you then?

709
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,600
Didn't you say you're Jin Fu?

710
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,160
How can I be your sister?

711
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,200
Let me tell you

712
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,840
I must find out

713
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,360
...how uncle was murdered

714
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,000
Once I do

715
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,360
I will not spare the murderer

716
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,360
...whoever he is

717
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:11,920
Search

718
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,040
Yes...

719
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,960
Where is Chiu Yu Lung?

720
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,560
Speak or I'll kill you

721
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,240
Are you speaking or not?

722
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,560
Speak up

723
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,000
Granny

724
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,000
Speak

725
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,840
Where has Chiu gone?

726
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,920
Speak

727
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,680
Speak

728
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,400
You two stay here and wait for him

729
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,600
Yes

730
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,680
He must be near by. Search

731
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,240
Little doggy...

732
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,360
Little doggy, tell me who did this

733
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,160
I'll avenge you

734
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,640
Master Chiu

735
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,440
Don't cry

736
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,360
It's you

737
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,000
Relax

738
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,840
If I were to kill you...

739
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,200
I could have done so through the door

740
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,680
But you'll lose your life too

741
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,720
I was never keen on it anyway

742
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,960
Let's see whom do
I eventually lose it to!

743
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,840
How come you're here?

744
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,600
Everyone is looking for me

745
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,800
...and wants to kill me

746
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,760
Only yours is a quiet place

747
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,000
But it's not a safe place

748
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,880
Aren't you looking for me as well?

749
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,200
How did you know?

750
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,440
You fear that I know?

751
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,280
You should stand up

752
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,680
...for your own deeds, why fear?

753
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,840
I was indeed looking for you

754
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,840
To take my life?

755
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,680
I ask you

756
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,920
What's your relationship with

757
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,200
...the Chiu Mansion?

758
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,040
No one should meddle in the Chius' affairs

759
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,720
You should know that

760
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,280
...I'm your good friend

761
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,440
Why look at me like this?

762
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,760
I have never done any deed

763
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,440
...to betray my friends

764
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,640
Sometimes things change

765
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,760
What do you mean by that?

766
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,920
Maybe due to circumstances

767
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,920
or a woman

768
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,680
or money

769
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,720
A man might change

770
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,600
Brother Yu Lung

771
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,400
You don't know me

772
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,520
You misjudge me

773
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,560
Misjudge you?

774
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,720
Look at this

775
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,520
Are you true to your friends?

776
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,480
Your mission is to kill me

777
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,120
This matter...

778
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,440
You needn't explain this

779
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,880
I won't falsely accuse you

780
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,760
Can you let me speak?

781
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,960
Stop fussing around

782
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,200
There's nothing to say

783
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,600
Let's make a clean break

784
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,040
Since you put it that way

785
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:35,840
What do you want?

786
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,440
I'll wait for you at Death Valley

787
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,240
Kill me if you can

788
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,360
What time?

789
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,240
Noon

790
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,480
You insist on doing it this way?

791
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,680
It's a deal

792
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,080
We'll each

793
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,200
...use our own weapons

794
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,400
I am sure you'll come

795
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,760
Brother Jin... damn it!

796
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,720
Chiu went to the mansion

797
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,400
...and took all my uncle's

798
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,480
...deeds and documents

799
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,320
You have to find him quickly

800
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,840
and kill him

801
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,360
And bring back the deeds

802
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,520
I'm not going

803
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,840
Why?

804
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,000
He is not an impostor

805
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,280
I believe he is your relative

806
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,400
Never mind whether he is
my relative or not

807
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,200
Just kill him

808
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,400
This is your family business

809
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,280
I shouldn't get involved in it

810
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,160
Shouldn't get involved?

811
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,480
Have you forgotten that

812
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,160
...you and your mother owe us favours

813
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,120
You are servant of the Chiu family

814
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,680
Just do whatever you are told

815
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,880
Let me tell you honestly

816
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,720
Your mother has already been
locked away by me

817
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,640
What do you want?

818
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,440
If you dare to harm me,

819
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,520
your mother will surely die

820
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,480
Release my mother

821
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,640
If you want her to be released...

822
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,480
go and kill Chiu Yu Lung

823
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,440
Well?

824
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,520
When?

825
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,000
I'll be meeting him

826
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,640
Where?

827
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,600
Death Valley

828
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,000
When?

829
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,400
Noon tomorrow

830
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,080
Alright, I'll wait for your good news

831
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,520
Deal?

832
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,600
Let's discuss this later

833
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,640
Be careful

834
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,480
It's an ambush!

835
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,880
Kill

836
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,160
I've to settle some business with
Chiu Jien Ying

837
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,200
See you later

838
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,960
Do you remember that blind old lady?

839
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,000
This stab

840
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,880
...is to avenge my friend Little Doggy

841
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,840
This is for my uncle

842
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,680
Brother

843
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,640
Let me tell you

844
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,640
Last night I saw a woman

845
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,400
...forcing Jin Fu to come to kill you

846
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,120
I misjudged him

847
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,800
You are so cruel

848
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,200
...to have forced me to kill Chiu Yu Lung

849
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,720
You want me dead too

850
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,960
What are you talking about?

851
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,560
I don't understand

852
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,240
Why would I?

853
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,760
Stop fussing around

854
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,560
Let my mother out

855
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,120
You've promised to kill Chiu Yu Lung

856
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:06,960
Have you done so?

857
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,200
Your family's affairs are
none of my business

858
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,800
Just let my mother go

859
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:12,440
You have to do

860
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,600
...whatever you've promised me

861
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,000
Speak

862
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,040
Where is my mother?

863
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,440
Let me tell you

864
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,400
I've killed all your men

865
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,440
If you don't tell the truth

866
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,040
I'll kill you too, speak

867
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,320
In the room downstairs

868
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,760
Are you telling the truth?

869
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:35,360
Go see for yourself

870
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,680
I'll kill you if she's not there

871
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,040
Where else could I go?

872
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,320
There's nowhere for you to flee

873
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,960
Let me tell you

874
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,800
Your mother has already been killed by me

875
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,600
What can you do to me?

876
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,640
You think you can fool me

877
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,680
You've been stabbed by my poisoned needles

878
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,200
You'll die soon

879
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,000
What good are you now?

880
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,480
Where can you go?

881
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:24,880
You have to let me go

882
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,080
You won't live long

883
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,000
Miss

884
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,040
Leave this place as soon as possible

885
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,120
Something dreadful will soon erupt

886
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:03,880
Yes

887
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,640
Let's go

888
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:35,840
Brother Jin

889
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,000
Who did this?

890
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,960
Chiu Jien Ying

891
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,800
I'll have my revenge

892
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,640
No need

893
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,560
She won't live long

894
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:04,840
Chase!

895
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,400
Brother, look

896
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,520
Over there
