1
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,760
Gotta see a doctor.

2
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,919
Is it an emergency?

3
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
I don't know. It's for him.

4
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,560
If it isn't an emergency,
you'll have to wait.

5
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,239
Sit down.

6
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,159
Can I have some of that?

7
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,839
Of course, Dr. Jeffries.

8
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,839
Has Bob seen them?

9
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,199
He's with number five.

10
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,319
Found him on the beach
near East Cliff Road.

11
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,839
Just standing there, he was.
Dazed. Like he is now.

12
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,999
I nearly run him over.

13
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,900
Lucky thing I was driving slow
because of the fog.

14
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,519
Will you come with me, please?

15
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,479
Yeah, I nearly hit him.

16
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,479
When I asked him
what the hell he was doing there,

17
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,239
well, he began vomiting
all over the street.

18
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,940
I thought the best thing
was to bring him here.

19
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,199
Thank you. You did right.

20
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:47,319
Come in here, please.

21
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,639
Take off your sweater and coat.

22
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,199
Have you been drinking?

23
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,359
What were you doing
on East Cliff Beach?

24
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,399
East Cliff Beach.
No, I wasn't drinking.

25
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,439
Shirt too, please.

26
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,638
I was lost. And… it was foggy.

27
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,999
Do you live here in Folkestone?

28
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,759
I was walking on the pier…

29
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,599
Did you come here by boat?

30
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,359
Yes. I did. I did.

31
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,959
Didn't I?

32
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,319
I don't know.
Where's your luggage?

33
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,559
Do you have a passport?
Any identification?

34
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:44,558
Why don't you look?

35
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:04,919
There's nothing.

36
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:07,239
What's your name?

37
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:11,998
Sit here, please.

38
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,919
I don't remember my name.

39
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,158
How did you do that?

40
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,398
On the beach, there was a woman.

41
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,478
Yes, I remember her…
her dress, it was torn.

42
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,878
I think there was an accident.

43
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,518
And she… she fell.

44
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,798
And I tried to help her.

45
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:53,838
Go on.

46
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:57,718
Who was she?

47
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,518
It was… It was very dark.
I couldn't see it…

48
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,278
No, wait. There was a light.
It was coming from the pier.

49
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:11,358
I saw this light--
I was running to the light.

50
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,198
Then that man came.

51
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,198
Did you tell him about the woman?

52
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,677
Did I? Yes, I… I must have.

53
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,798
No, I don't think I did.

54
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:41,917
Why can't I remember my name?

55
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,918
Do you need any help?

56
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:52,718
A drunk.

57
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,238
Are you signing him in?

58
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:55,958
No. He wants to go to London.

59
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,798
I'll drive him to the station.
It's on my way.

60
00:08:58,797 --> 00:08:59,757
Right.

61
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:02,477
You ready?

62
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:05,277
- Yes.
- Let's go.

63
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,957
- Good night.
- Good night, Doctor.

64
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:13,997
- See you tomorrow.
- Monday.

65
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,277
I forgot. Excuse me.

66
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,998
- No phone calls, please.
- Promise.

67
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,437
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:30,237
The day is breaking.

69
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,557
Why didn't I stay at the hospital?

70
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:52,317
I'm taking you to my home.
You know what hospitals are like.

71
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:54,517
They'll just put you in a ward
and forget about you.

72
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,637
You need more than that.
- Why?

73
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:00,477
I want to keep you
under observation for a while.

74
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,237
Do you…

75
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,357
What?

76
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,597
Do you do this often?

77
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:14,997
Occasionally. It's my specialty.

78
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:16,037
What is?

79
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,997
Memory. Memory failure.

80
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:21,437
It's fascinating.
It's like electronics.

81
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:23,717
What do you think I got?

82
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:27,636
We'll see.

83
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,677
Look…

84
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:37,757
East Cliff Beach.

85
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,357
Why do you bring me out here?

86
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,836
I didn't. It's on the way.

87
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,277
You recognize this place?

88
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:50,436
What place?

89
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,876
The place where you saw
this woman. Was it here?

90
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:55,837
I'm not sure.

91
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,316
Wait here. I'll be right back.

92
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:32,636
I didn't see anything.

93
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,116
How long am I going to stay here?

94
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:18,395
Well, that depends.

95
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:22,115
It's considerate of you.

96
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,315
Not at all. It's my job.

97
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:28,715
What was in that shot you gave me?

98
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:30,475
Are you feeling sleepy?

99
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,955
- Yeah.
- Good.

100
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:39,955
Are you sure I'm not going
to be in your way?

101
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,595
Not at all.
There's plenty of room here.

102
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:49,795
What are you gonna do with me?

103
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,395
Well, how about a drink to begin
with? Or some orange juice?

104
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,955
- Okay.
- Okay. Make yourself at home.

105
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:13,755
Where are you going?

106
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,635
Not running out on me, are you?

107
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:19,955
Well, go on.

108
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:23,635
I was feeling better. So I…

109
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:26,475
You won't get very far.
Well, it's up to you.

110
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,235
You want me to lend
you a few quid?

111
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,977
Why don't you just relax for a
few minutes and think it over?

112
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:48,195
What am I going to do?

113
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:55,474
Are you…

114
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,315
Am I what?

115
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:58,955
- Married?
- No.

116
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:00,755
You live here alone?

117
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:03,235
Yes.

118
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:04,554
Don't worry.

119
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:07,274
I'm not Dr. Frankenstein, trying
to lure you into my laboratory.

120
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,514
Just… just try to relax.

121
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,115
I'm… what do you call it?
Amnesiac, is that it?

122
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:23,194
Looks that way. Although I dislike
putting labels on my patients.

123
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:27,434
What causes it?

124
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:30,155
Well, many different things.
A fall perhaps.

125
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:31,554
I think I did come by boat.

126
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,794
I seem to remember…

127
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:38,274
the sea… disembarking passengers…

128
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,315
Anything else?

129
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,075
Anything else.

130
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:49,274
Darkness… a blur.

131
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:53,274
You think you can do anything for me?
- I'm certain I can.

132
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,715
- It's like I'm asleep, you know?
- I know.

133
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:59,754
Now the only thing is
to wake you up again.

134
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,074
Then you go right ahead.

135
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,714
If you think that
you arrived by boat,

136
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:08,194
let's see if we can find out
where you might have come from.

137
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:10,674
Maybe I came by ghost ship.

138
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:13,514
I don't believe in ghosts.

139
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,794
Hello, Port Authority?

140
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:20,474
Can you tell me what ships
docked this morning, please?

141
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,154
Between midnight and 3:00 or 4:00.

142
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,234
I beg your pardon? A ferryboat.

143
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:29,553
Yes. Coming from where?

144
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,474
I see. Thank you very much.

145
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,514
The <i>Cornwall</i> from Dieppe.

146
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:40,634
Does that mean anything to you?
Dieppe? France?

147
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,154
You don't think I'm French?

148
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,194
Well, even though you have
an American accent,

149
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,954
you could have been
living anywhere.

150
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:52,514
And you could have been traveling
to Paris maybe, on a business trip.

151
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:57,273
Not without a passport, though,
or money or luggage.

152
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,874
By the way, did you notice?

153
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,514
You're married.

154
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:04,113
What?

155
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:06,274
You're married.

156
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:09,114
Yes. I'm married.

157
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:14,114
Or divorced. Or separated.
Or a widower.

158
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:18,314
There are so many different
combinations between a man and a woman.

159
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:24,433
Anyway, that's the way
we'll do it, piece by piece.

160
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:27,954
My wife must be worried about me.

161
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:30,114
What?

162
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:33,633
My wife must be wondering
what the hell happened to me.

163
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:35,273
What did you say?

164
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:39,474
Only that we'll have to
reconstruct you, bit by bit.

165
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:41,553
Your ring, your clothes, perhaps.

166
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,313
We'll talk about that later.
I want you to sleep now.

167
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:47,113
Come on.

168
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:49,833
This is the guest room.

169
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,393
I think you'll be
comfortable here.

170
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:05,833
I know the first
thing I'm going to do.

171
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:11,313
This is really very nice of
you, Doctor…

172
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:13,473
Laurence. Laurence Jeffries.

173
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,072
Even though I'm tired and half asleep,
I'm beginning to feel like a new man

174
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:21,432
and I thought maybe
I'd thank you again.

175
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:23,713
You forgot your raincoat.

176
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:26,352
I'm forgetting everything.

177
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:31,432
Listen, I wonder
how you got through customs.

178
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:35,873
- Customs…
- Yes.

179
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:38,272
Assuming that you did arrive
from France on that ferryboat,

180
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:41,592
you'd have to have had
a passport and identification.

181
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:43,632
Yes, I would, wouldn't I?

182
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:48,113
You sure there's nothing in
your pockets? Look again.

183
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:54,512
- Nothing.
- And the raincoat?

184
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:09,913
No, nothing.

185
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:15,472
Well, then you must have lost
your passport after you arrived.

186
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:17,552
Yes, that must be it.

187
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:22,232
Well, we'll see.
I want you to sleep now.

188
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:27,472
I don't think I'm
gonna be able to sleep.

189
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:31,552
Yes, you will. I put two
tranquilizers in your orange juice.

190
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,413
Now, what the hell did you do
a thing like that for?

191
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,352
- You're gonna have to trust me.
- Trust you?

192
00:20:37,232 --> 00:20:38,712
I do trust you, Doctor.

193
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:42,352
Wait a minute. Come here.

194
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:47,632
As long as you're here, would you mind
giving me a sample of your handwriting?

195
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:54,511
- My handwriting?
- Yes. Just jot something down.

196
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:55,632
Anything at all.

197
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:59,112
Quite a lot can be learned
from a patient's autography.

198
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:00,831
Okay.

199
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:10,192
- What am I going to write?
- Anything.

200
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:11,912
"Arrived in Folkestone tonight."

201
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,752
Okay.

202
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:19,792
Arrived…

203
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,191
- That doesn't look so good.
- No, no. It looks fine.

204
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:34,632
Okay, go to sleep.

205
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,071
Okay.

206
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:50,992
November 17th. Memory failure.

207
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,992
Patient brought in by a fisherman.

208
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,351
Notes for paragraph 133.

209
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,631
Symptoms of total
amnesia, cause unknown.

210
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:04,631
Schizophrenic tendencies.

211
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,831
Good morning.

212
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,351
Are you just getting back?

213
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:31,270
There was an accident
over by the yacht club.

214
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:33,870
Surgery.

215
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:37,391
And then I had to take care
of an alcoholic.

216
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,791
Had to drive him to the station.

217
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,590
What about sleep
that knits the sleeve of care?

218
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,691
I know what you're thinking,

219
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:49,270
that I just crawled out of bed
with some ravishing young nurse.

220
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,351
I didn't say a thing.

221
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:54,711
I can hear you think.

222
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,591
Oh, I'm thinking about husbands

223
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,671
that aren't spending
all their days and nights

224
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,391
mending broken skulls
and lunatic brains.

225
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,950
That's my job.

226
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:06,270
With you, it's not a job.
It's an obsession.

227
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,430
It's too bad the Winston people
can't see that scene.

228
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,510
It would make a nice commercial.

229
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:18,030
You're not gonna go on about my smoking
in the morning again, I hope. Spare me.

230
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,750
Just… trying to be nice.

231
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,550
Open the shade instead.

232
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,190
- London again?
- Of course, London. I told you.

233
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,070
You're always going to London.

234
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,870
I know. You detest my brother.

235
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,590
Well, let's not even go into it.

236
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,470
I don't detest him.
I like and respect Andrew.

237
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,150
I only wish he lived in Folkestone, so
you and I could see more of each other.

238
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,430
Swinging Folkestone, right?

239
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,710
What is it?

240
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,910
Nothing. It's you.

241
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,950
Good morning, Doctor.

242
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,390
- Good morning, Lucy.
- You're up early.

243
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,710
I'm up late.
I just got back from work.

244
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,030
Why don't you move to the hospital
and get it over with?

245
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,550
You'll be there permanently as
a patient if you keep this up.

246
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:51,709
Good morning, Lucy.

247
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,269
Good morning, ma'am.

248
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:56,269
- Don't forget my taxi at 8:15.
- No, ma'am.

249
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,390
And don't leave it to the
last minute this time.

250
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:00,030
My train goes at 9:11.

251
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:01,270
No, ma'am.

252
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:02,869
Did you find my umbrella yet?

253
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:05,829
No, I haven't.
And I've looked everywhere.

254
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,949
That makes the fourth umbrella
I've lost this year.

255
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,269
You should read this story.

256
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:15,069
A man in Dover shot his wife

257
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:17,829
because she was seeing
too much of his dentist.

258
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,229
God. Imagine.

259
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:24,229
The space age, and people are
still killing each other for that.

260
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,629
What's the space age
got to do with it?

261
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,909
Can't you picture an
astronaut on the moon

262
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,870
cutting his copilot's oxygen line

263
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:34,549
because he suspects the guy
of sleeping with his wife?

264
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:36,429
You don't think men
will ever change then?

265
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,389
No. Neither will women.

266
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:05,949
How nice.

267
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:09,469
He was a plumber.

268
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,189
Who?

269
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:16,269
It's always those Lower Depths
creatures who do that sort of thing.

270
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,469
At least they're creatures with
the courage of their convictions.

271
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:21,789
Do you think it's courage?

272
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,229
In any event,
they liberate themselves.

273
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:28,869
It's the intelligent
ones who suffer.

274
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:30,308
How do you know?

275
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:33,029
I've never seen the faintest
symptom of jealousy in you.

276
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,829
Well, maybe I've actually
been dying of it all these years.

277
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:42,429
Well, what do you think
the civilized man would do?

278
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:46,908
He'd find an intelligent way
of resolving the problem.

279
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:48,949
That would satisfy him
more than an actual killing,

280
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,789
at the same time, making sure
that he doesn't get caught.

281
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:54,988
Thank you.

282
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,269
- Oh, balls.
- What?

283
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,788
I've broken a nail.

284
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:04,588
Larry, I have to get dressed.

285
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:08,588
- Do you really?
- What?

286
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,908
Today's my day off. Tomorrow too.

287
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:14,869
Couldn't you postpone London
until next week?

288
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:16,509
It's too late now, Larry.

289
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:18,588
Oh, darling,
please don't be difficult.

290
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:19,909
You're hurting me.

291
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:30,188
No.

292
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,068
Did you look in there
for my umbrella?

293
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:49,188
No, I didn't.

294
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:51,548
Okay, I'll look.

295
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:58,068
Darling…

296
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,268
Your umbrella may be in the car.

297
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,828
That's where I left it.

298
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,868
I'll look.

299
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:10,948
Goodbye, Larry.

300
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:12,562
You want me to drive
you to the station?

301
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:15,388
Don't do anything
drastic on my account.

302
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:18,428
Anyway, the taxi's here.
Any message for my brother?

303
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,788
Just… give him my love.

304
00:29:22,788 --> 00:29:24,908
And you too.
- Me too, what?

305
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:28,428
All my love.

306
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:29,988
Thank you, dear.

307
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:35,868
Here it is.
Have a nice trip, ma'am.

308
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:36,907
Thank you, Lucy.

309
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:05,467
To the Hoverport in Dover, please.

310
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:08,987
What? Your maid said
you was to go to the station.

311
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,627
Then you were misinformed.

312
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,908
Aren't you going to sleep at
all, Doctor?

313
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:36,827
How's it going between
you and Robert?

314
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:38,667
Is it… John?

315
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:39,867
Edgar.

316
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:41,188
Edgar.

317
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,387
I'm confusing him
with the milkman.

318
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,908
He's not a milkman. He's a sailor.

319
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,108
Why does that make you sad?

320
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:52,667
Because he's leaving Monday.

321
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:55,987
Well, aren't you going
to say goodbye to him?

322
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:57,827
Goodbye?

323
00:30:58,387 --> 00:30:59,787
Don't you know that it's bad luck

324
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:03,147
to let a sailor weigh anchor
without bidding him bon voyage?

325
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,427
Come on, get your things.
I'll drive you to the station.

326
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:08,387
But I…

327
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,117
Wouldn't you rather
spend four days with him

328
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:11,827
than four days with me?

329
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:14,107
You mean, four days off?

330
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,947
Just long enough to keep you
from boring each other.

331
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:21,507
<i>Hovercraft flight to
Boulogne, France,</i>

332
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:24,827
<i>closing now at exit B.</i>

333
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,107
Just a second. I forgot something.

334
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,586
Are you going to marry him?

335
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,986
Well, that's for him to decide.

336
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,386
You and he, that's
forever, I suppose?

337
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:38,707
Well, for me at least, yes.

338
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:46,226
Then I insist on being
the godfather of Albert Junior.

339
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,266
Edgar.

340
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:50,466
You're very funny, you know.

341
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,226
It's nice to make people laugh.

342
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:44,666
Doctor?

343
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:32,705
How do you feel?

344
00:34:32,786 --> 00:34:33,825
I feel great.

345
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,505
You've shaved.

346
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:37,225
Yeah, I had a bath too.

347
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:39,225
- I hear you found the record player.
- Yes.

348
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:42,105
It's turning into a beautiful day.
Who could ask for anything more?

349
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,105
What time is it?

350
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:47,506
- Quarter after two. Are you hungry?
- Yeah. I'm starved.

351
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,866
Well, let's have some lunch.

352
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:57,425
You always do your own cooking?

353
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,986
Or do you have somebody
come in sometimes?

354
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:04,465
Once a week, a woman comes in
and cleans the place up

355
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,426
and breaks a few things.

356
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,265
Usually,
I take my meals in a restaurant.

357
00:35:10,185 --> 00:35:11,345
One lump or two?

358
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:16,585
Well, take one then. If you
want more, just help yourself.

359
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:17,985
I really don't know.

360
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,225
Well, one then.

361
00:35:21,305 --> 00:35:24,225
Listen. Don't be discouraged.

362
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:27,345
I've got reason to be discouraged.

363
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,785
Not really. Because I think
I have some good news for you.

364
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:32,625
I went back to the port again.

365
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:36,025
You found something?

366
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:38,585
A suitcase near East Cliff Beach.

367
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:41,144
Is it mine?

368
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,905
Nine chances out of ten it is.

369
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,065
Why don't we have a look at it?

370
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:55,305
It's a good suitcase.

371
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,265
Ten guineas at least.

372
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:02,905
You think that's really mine?

373
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:06,025
Well, there's only one way
to find out. Try this on.

374
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:15,945
It's nice material.
You have good taste.

375
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:19,465
And it… really seems to fit.

376
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:26,225
I think it is mine.

377
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:31,825
Just yesterday… or today?

378
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:35,985
I was wondering, who am I?

379
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:37,784
I could be anybody.

380
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,824
A street cleaner, a tramp.

381
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:44,664
But this proves I'm…

382
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,464
It proves that you know
how to buy clothes,

383
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:48,025
and that you can afford the best.

384
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:50,824
And, look… Paris.

385
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,545
Paris.

386
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:57,944
Vincent's, Saville Row.

387
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:00,344
Well,
you may have come from France,

388
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:01,625
but you don't live there.

389
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:04,584
I live in London, right?

390
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,264
Probably. Better check
the rest of the stuff.

391
00:37:13,584 --> 00:37:14,784
Here's a letter.

392
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:16,824
Can I see?

393
00:37:22,704 --> 00:37:24,144
What the hell?

394
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,824
May I?

395
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,384
She's lovely.

396
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:39,144
Do you think this is my wife?

397
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,184
Could be.

398
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:45,424
What would I be doing with a
picture like this in my suitcase?

399
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:48,024
Well, maybe you're a photographer.

400
00:37:49,824 --> 00:37:50,904
Paris again.

401
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:54,023
Paris, the 12th of November.

402
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:57,304
"My love, I cannot wait any--"

403
00:37:57,384 --> 00:37:59,584
Just a minute now.
That sounds like a love letter.

404
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:01,144
It certainly does.

405
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:03,704
"I cannot wait any longer.
I want to be…"

406
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:07,623
I don't think that you should read
this, because it's from my wife.

407
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:11,343
No. It's signed "Paul."

408
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:17,704
You see…

409
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:20,663
If I'm married and
that's my suitcase…

410
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:23,263
this letter must be from me.

411
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,824
- I'm Paul.
- No.

412
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:28,024
- How the hell do you know?
- Wait a second.

413
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:30,503
Just compare these
two handwritings.

414
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:31,944
They're entirely different.

415
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,063
Yeah. They're different.

416
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:47,184
What's it doing in my suitcase?

417
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:49,544
Well,
maybe the woman gave it to you.

418
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:52,183
Or you stole it. Shall I read it?

419
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,023
"My love…"

420
00:38:55,144 --> 00:38:56,583
I'm afraid it's very personal.

421
00:38:58,623 --> 00:39:00,104
"I cannot wait any longer.

422
00:39:00,183 --> 00:39:03,544
I want to be near you,
next to you, your…

423
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:07,384
your naked shoulder touching mine.

424
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:10,264
I want your touch, your lips,"
etcetera, etcetera.

425
00:39:10,343 --> 00:39:12,943
"I made a reservation for us
in the same hotel,

426
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:16,463
the Bonaparte, Rue Jacob.
Our hotel.

427
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:17,983
The same room. Remember?

428
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:20,503
This time we will
stay together forever.

429
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:25,143
I'd rather see you dead
than go back to him."

430
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:26,864
"Him"?

431
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:28,623
"Waiting for you. Longing for you.

432
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:30,063
Loving you. Paul."

433
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:31,743
- Him.
- I know what you're thinking.

434
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:33,663
That "him" could be you.

435
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,743
Yeah, and he's Paul.

436
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:42,223
There you are, you see?

437
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:45,623
I'm not a street cleaner, a tramp.

438
00:39:45,703 --> 00:39:49,143
I'm a son of a bitching fool, and
they're making a fool out of me.

439
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:58,023
Unless this… this
stuff isn't mine.

440
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,983
It isn't mine. Isn't mine!

441
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:04,742
Just because this jacket fits,

442
00:40:04,823 --> 00:40:06,903
it doesn't mean it belongs to me.

443
00:40:07,663 --> 00:40:08,982
Just a minute. Wait a second.

444
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:11,223
There is one way to find out.
Try these on.

445
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:15,543
We have to be certain.
Try these on.

446
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:17,782
Do as I say.

447
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:36,783
November 18th.

448
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,903
Observations of
November 17th continued.

449
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:45,263
Results still in a negative stage.

450
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:50,623
Various attempts to stimulate
the subject's memory have failed.

451
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:56,982
Renewed indications of schizophrenia
after graphological tests.

452
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:19,382
They fit.

453
00:41:21,702 --> 00:41:24,622
Yes. I think they're mine too.

454
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:26,222
I found this in the pocket.

455
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:28,662
Let me see.

456
00:41:36,982 --> 00:41:38,622
This looks like your handwriting.

457
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:48,422
Is it the same?

458
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:51,141
It's the same.

459
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:33,302
I must have left a window open.

460
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:35,262
I think there's a storm coming up.

461
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,302
I think I know what happened.

462
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:45,422
That bastard!
That… that stinking bastard.

463
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,221
Take it easy.
Who are you talking about?

464
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,062
Him.

465
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:55,901
"Waiting for you.
Longing for you. Loving you."

466
00:42:56,662 --> 00:42:58,101
Do you want a drink?

467
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:00,981
My wife is dead.

468
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:21,261
Did I tell you about the woman?

469
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:23,261
On the beach?

470
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,181
Yes, on the beach.
I thought it was an accident.

471
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:28,981
She was bleeding.

472
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:30,021
Yes.

473
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:33,781
It was my wife.

474
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:37,581
She was murdered. He killed her.

475
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:40,302
You mean, Paul?

476
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:42,341
Yes. Paul.

477
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,821
Go on. Tell me about it.

478
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:48,501
It's here,
and, you see, I wrote it all down.

479
00:43:48,581 --> 00:43:52,141
I wrote it right here.
Frances left me, you see.

480
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:56,101
Frances?
Your… your wife's name is Frances?

481
00:43:57,021 --> 00:43:58,741
Her name was Frances, yes.

482
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:02,461
I think it was…

483
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:06,181
November 13th,
I followed her to Paris.

484
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:08,341
It's in here, you see? Here.

485
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,541
It says November 14th,
I waited outside the hotel.

486
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:15,300
"Saw Frances and Paul.

487
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:18,341
They walked in the Luxembourg
Gardens. I followed them.

488
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:21,060
Tuesday the 16th.
Managed to see Frances alone.

489
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:25,221
She is unhappy and frightened.
She told me Paul terrifies her."

490
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:28,301
- Yeah… - "She is coming
home with me tomorrow."

491
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:30,301
Tomorrow, that was yesterday.

492
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:33,380
I can well understand
why she's afraid.

493
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:35,180
- Why?
- Because of this.

494
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,381
"I'd rather see you dead
than go back to him."

495
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,540
Yeah.

496
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:42,300
Was he on the boat too?

497
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:46,860
- I don't know.
- Did you see him? Did you talk to him?

498
00:44:46,941 --> 00:44:48,660
I don't know.

499
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,500
Well, you felt threatened
too, didn't you?

500
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:53,061
- Me?
- Yeah.

501
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,820
You were just as afraid
of him as she was.

502
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:55,861
I was?

503
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,140
Because of this.

504
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,740
They're from the gun that's in
the pocket of your raincoat.

505
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,101
Why didn't you tell me about that?

506
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,940
Answer me, please.
- Well, I…

507
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,402
You told me your
pockets were empty.

508
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:15,181
- Yes. I don't know.
- Why?

509
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,820
You put yourself in my place.

510
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,300
You know, I was…

511
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,700
I don't know anybody
and nobody knows me,

512
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:28,100
and if I showed you the gun, you
would turn me over to the police.

513
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,540
Isn't that right?

514
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,580
And then you wouldn't have
anything to do with me.

515
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,700
I understand. You felt
threatened and you were armed.

516
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,740
Yes.

517
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,620
By the way, there's…

518
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,380
there's one missing.

519
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,220
- What?
- Yeah. One of the bullets.

520
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,900
There should be six.
There's only five.

521
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,300
One… two… three…

522
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,020
four… five.

523
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,419
It's only five.

524
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,260
Yeah.

525
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,380
Maybe the other one's in the gun.

526
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,860
It isn't in here. Look.

527
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,140
Then it's been fired.

528
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:35,220
I don't know.

529
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:37,580
Imagine Paul was on that boat.

530
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:39,660
He disembarked when
you and your wife did.

531
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,259
He followed you. And in the
fog, he attacked both of you.

532
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,700
- You took a shot at him.
- Did I?

533
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,260
You missed him, obviously.
There was a struggle.

534
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,340
That would account
for those scratches on your chest.

535
00:46:50,419 --> 00:46:53,179
Then-- Well, then he overpowered
you, you and your wife.

536
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:54,779
Then what did I do?

537
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,899
You blacked out.

538
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,140
Let's clear up this mess.

539
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,939
Poor Frances…

540
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,380
She's out there somewhere.

541
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,379
They probably found her by now.

542
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:27,099
We have to notify the police.

543
00:47:27,899 --> 00:47:29,580
You don't know the police.

544
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:31,500
You might end up
being charged with the murder.

545
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:33,779
That would be a perfect
revenge for Paul.

546
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:37,059
In fact, Paul who?
You don't even know his last name.

547
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:39,579
He can be traced.

548
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:43,580
You know that hotel in Paris.

549
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:44,899
I can trace him.

550
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,299
I'm going to find him.

551
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:50,299
I'm going to find him
if it's the last thing I do.

552
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:54,859
Who is it?

553
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,739
It's all right.
It's one of my patients probably.

554
00:47:57,819 --> 00:47:58,779
Here.

555
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,939
Take this and go to your room.

556
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:02,979
It's okay.

557
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:22,818
Thanks for coming, Andrew.
How was your trip?

558
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,859
What's this all about, Larry? You were
absolutely incoherent on the phone.

559
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:27,659
Not so loud.
I've got a patient in there.

560
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:36,258
Tell me, Andrew,
what time did you leave London?

561
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:38,058
2:23.

562
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:41,659
- Did you see Frances before you left?
- Frances? No. Is she in London?

563
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:44,579
She's supposed to be visiting you.

564
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:47,538
Actually, she's in Paris.

565
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:48,699
In Paris?

566
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,419
Your sister has run out on
me, Andrew.

567
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:53,939
Frances? Nonsense!

568
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:58,218
- Frances has been having an affair.
- Rubbish. She's not that kind.

569
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:01,739
I found this in her
purse this morning.

570
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:08,778
"My love.
I cannot wait any longer.

571
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:10,698
I want to be near
you, next to you,

572
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,979
your naked shoulder
touching mine," etcetera.

573
00:49:13,898 --> 00:49:16,019
Well, I'm flabbergasted.
Who's Paul?

574
00:49:16,098 --> 00:49:18,339
Paul Damien. He's a journalist.

575
00:49:18,418 --> 00:49:20,458
Until recently,
he was the English correspondent

576
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:22,699
for <i>l'Agence France-Presse.</i>

577
00:49:22,778 --> 00:49:26,778
That's where they used to meet,
in London, using you as an alibi.

578
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:28,178
Nice, eh?

579
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:31,298
Now he's been transferred back
to Paris and she's gone with him.

580
00:49:31,379 --> 00:49:33,178
Have you discussed
this with Frances?

581
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:35,339
- No.
- Why not?

582
00:49:37,178 --> 00:49:40,258
I don't know.
Just the dignity of the thing.

583
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:44,539
Anyway, I wanted to find out
how far she'd go.

584
00:49:45,578 --> 00:49:48,498
Straight to a hotel on the Left
Bank. That's how far she went.

585
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:50,458
What do you intend to do, Larry?

586
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:52,578
Divorce.

587
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:56,098
I want to get it over with.
I can't take anymore.

588
00:49:56,178 --> 00:49:59,218
Well, I don't see what
it has to do with me, old boy.

589
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:04,098
I want to settle this thing
as graciously as possible.

590
00:50:04,178 --> 00:50:05,538
That's why I need your help.

591
00:50:06,698 --> 00:50:08,818
I want you to arrange
a meeting between us.

592
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:11,858
- With… with Paul Damien?
- Yes.

593
00:50:11,938 --> 00:50:14,298
You really want to
meet this creature?

594
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:18,058
Creature.
You sound just like Frances.

595
00:50:18,138 --> 00:50:19,218
Yes, I do.

596
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:22,618
I've never met him
and I'm curious to.

597
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:25,218
Wouldn't you be if
you were in my place?

598
00:50:26,058 --> 00:50:27,418
Where do you want to meet him?

599
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:30,138
- Here.
- Here?

600
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:31,938
That's the least he can do.

601
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:35,138
I want you to go to Paris
or telephone him.

602
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:38,258
I don't care which.
Just make sure he comes here.

603
00:50:38,337 --> 00:50:41,538
He's staying at the Hotel
Bonaparte, 43 Rue Jacob.

604
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:43,417
What if he refuses?

605
00:50:44,217 --> 00:50:47,698
Well, you wouldn't want
your sister involved in anything…

606
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,897
troublesome, would you?

607
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:56,498
Okay. Hotel Bonaparte.

608
00:50:59,778 --> 00:51:03,017
I'll wait until I hear from him.
I won't leave the house.

609
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:05,897
And, Andrew,
I want him to come alone.

610
00:51:06,778 --> 00:51:07,857
Insist on that.

611
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:11,429
Frances must be kept
out of it altogether.

612
00:51:11,498 --> 00:51:12,538
I agree, Larry.

613
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:15,418
But it is a bloody awkward
kind of mission.

614
00:51:15,497 --> 00:51:17,938
I want you to handle it
so that it won't be awkward.

615
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:23,138
Goodbye.

616
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:03,657
Hey, what are you doing?

617
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:05,737
- I'm leaving.
- Really?

618
00:52:07,097 --> 00:52:10,177
- May I ask where you're going?
- I'm going to Paris. I found out his name.

619
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:12,617
His name is Paul Damien.

620
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:15,737
- How do you know that?
- I know. I'll show you.

621
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:19,937
Right here in this book,
it's on the last page. See?

622
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:22,198
I see. And what are you going
to do once you get to Paris?

623
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:24,457
Never mind. I don't want
you to become involved.

624
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:29,257
- You give me that.
- Now, wait a minute.

625
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:31,817
If you're absolutely determined
to see this man,

626
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:33,057
we can bring him here.

627
00:52:36,017 --> 00:52:37,817
You can bring him
here to Folkestone?

628
00:52:38,937 --> 00:52:39,976
In this house?

629
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,017
Sure.

630
00:52:44,017 --> 00:52:47,577
No. He'll never come.

631
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:49,657
Yes, he will. He'll come.

632
00:52:52,576 --> 00:52:54,577
You're going to write
him a letter, right now.

633
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:56,976
You'll give him 24
hours to get here.

634
00:52:57,057 --> 00:52:59,097
If at the end of that time
he hasn't shown up,

635
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,816
you'll go to the police about him.

636
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:02,817
You can bet he'll
be on the next boat.

637
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:05,817
He'd much rather be blackmailed than
charged with first-degree murder.

638
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:07,936
What, blackmailed?

639
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:10,136
He'll naturally assume
that's what you're up to.

640
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:14,416
Stay here.

641
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:43,297
Dr. Jeffries? I'm Sergeant Gordon.

642
00:53:44,736 --> 00:53:46,296
Well, come in, Sergeant.

643
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:47,537
Thank you, sir.

644
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:50,816
A man was brought
to the hospital last night,

645
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:52,576
or rather early this morning.

646
00:53:52,656 --> 00:53:55,497
A fisherman found him
in East Cliff Beach.

647
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:57,977
Oh, yes, the alcoholic.

648
00:53:58,056 --> 00:54:00,096
I was told you drove
him to the station.

649
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:04,136
Yes, I did.
He caught the 5:05 to London.

650
00:54:04,216 --> 00:54:07,016
He'd sobered up a bit. There was no
reason to keep him at the hospital.

651
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:09,136
Did you actually see
him catch the train?

652
00:54:10,536 --> 00:54:12,456
No.

653
00:54:12,536 --> 00:54:15,376
I let him out of the car
in front of the station.

654
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:18,696
Then you're not absolutely sure
he took the 5:05, are you, sir?

655
00:54:21,496 --> 00:54:22,656
No.

656
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:25,576
Well, I think that will be all
for the moment, sir.

657
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:27,696
What's… what's he done, Sergeant?

658
00:54:27,776 --> 00:54:31,696
Three days ago, a patient escaped
from the psychiatric clinic at Lewis.

659
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:34,216
A woman was found in the dunes,
raped and strangled.

660
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:36,856
How awful.

661
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:39,776
He's our number
one suspect so far.

662
00:54:41,776 --> 00:54:43,535
Well, thank you for your
help, sir.

663
00:55:15,576 --> 00:55:16,735
That was the police.

664
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:24,776
They found your wife.

665
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,895
They think you killed her.

666
00:55:31,056 --> 00:55:32,976
It wasn't me. It was Paul Damien.

667
00:55:34,216 --> 00:55:35,935
They don't even know he exists.

668
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,616
So you see, you can't leave now.

669
00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:41,615
No. Wait here.

670
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:54,136
They're looking for me…

671
00:55:56,095 --> 00:55:59,975
and he's over there in Paris, laughing
his head off at how clever he is.

672
00:56:00,055 --> 00:56:01,215
Free as a bird.

673
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:03,295
Not for long.

674
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:06,095
Oh, hell.
He won't come back here now.

675
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:07,576
Now that they found her.

676
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:11,655
It's going to be in all the papers. He
won't come back now. I know he won't.

677
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:15,536
Yes, he will… after
he gets your letter.

678
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:21,655
But what do I write?

679
00:56:21,735 --> 00:56:24,375
Word it any way you like.
He'll understand.

680
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:29,095
"Must see you in Folkestone immediately,
before contacting the police."

681
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:31,815
Be sure to put that down.
And use my address.

682
00:56:31,895 --> 00:56:32,855
Okay.

683
00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:42,255
Why are you doing this for me?

684
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:46,095
- Because you're my patient.
- Yes. Okay.

685
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:56,935
The metamorphosis is complete.

686
00:56:57,735 --> 00:57:00,575
The personality transplant
has not been rejected.

687
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:04,015
On the contrary, he has become me.

688
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,735
Incapable of motivations
from his own past,

689
00:57:07,814 --> 00:57:09,295
he has accepted my past.

690
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:15,695
I'm no longer an actor in
the drama, only a spectator.

691
00:57:18,094 --> 00:57:19,614
Though the props are mine,

692
00:57:19,695 --> 00:57:21,735
they too were accepted
with remarkable ease,

693
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:22,815
as anticipated.

694
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:25,934
The valise I prepared for him.

695
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:30,535
The suit I measured for him while he
slept and will now have to destroy.

696
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:32,494
The diary I wrote.

697
00:57:33,935 --> 00:57:36,575
The nude photograph of Frances
I supplied to…

698
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,534
stimulate him.

699
00:57:39,855 --> 00:57:41,895
Her letter from Paul
I found in her purse.

700
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:45,974
Everything.

701
00:57:58,535 --> 00:58:00,015
That's great.

702
00:58:00,094 --> 00:58:01,894
That's short enough
to send as a cable.

703
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:06,414
- Oh, hell.
- I'm sorry.

704
00:58:06,494 --> 00:58:08,054
Does this stuff stain?

705
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:10,055
Gee, I don't know.
But it sure got in my eye.

706
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,134
Hell, you ruined my suit.

707
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:13,615
No, no, no. It's not ruined.

708
00:58:13,694 --> 00:58:14,894
Yes, it is. Look at that.

709
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:16,294
I'll send it to the cleaner.

710
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:19,214
Meanwhile, let me get
this off first thing, okay?

711
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,014
<i>Seventeenth.</i>

712
01:00:07,694 --> 01:00:08,733
<i>Memory failure.</i>

713
01:00:10,093 --> 01:00:11,694
<i>Patient brought in by a fisherman.</i>

714
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:15,013
<i>Notes for paragraph 133.</i>

715
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:19,413
<i>Symptoms of total
amnesia, cause unknown.</i>

716
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:22,373
<i>Schizophrenic tenden--</i>

717
01:00:25,653 --> 01:00:27,533
You mustn't touch that.

718
01:00:27,613 --> 01:00:30,133
- You were talking about me.
- Yeah, it's okay.

719
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:33,094
The case histories of all my
patients are recorded here.

720
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:40,453
- There's a lot of them here.
- Yeah.

721
01:00:43,533 --> 01:00:46,453
- You send that telegram?
- Yeah. It's on its way.

722
01:00:48,213 --> 01:00:50,893
Come on. I'll teach you
how to play Liars' Dice.

723
01:00:51,373 --> 01:00:52,333
Okay.

724
01:02:01,172 --> 01:02:03,012
He won't come.

725
01:02:05,452 --> 01:02:07,332
Maybe he never got the telegram.

726
01:02:07,413 --> 01:02:08,972
You shouldn't have
anything to drink.

727
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:13,453
Maybe it was the wrong address.

728
01:02:13,532 --> 01:02:15,253
He could have left
Paris, you know.

729
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:17,492
- Why don't we open that goddamn window?
- No.

730
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:19,332
Do you want another tranquilizer?

731
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:20,372
No!

732
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:23,052
Why don't you call the harbor?

733
01:02:23,132 --> 01:02:25,292
Find out when the
next boat arrives.

734
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:27,572
He's not necessarily
coming by boat.

735
01:02:27,652 --> 01:02:30,452
He could've flown to London
and taken the train from there.

736
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,812
Hello, Information? Can you tell me when
the next boat from France arrives, please?

737
01:02:37,572 --> 01:02:39,492
<i>Hovercraft from Boulogne,
sir, just coming in.</i>

738
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:41,132
Thank you.

739
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:45,372
It's in the harbor now. If he's on
it, he'll be here in 15 minutes.

740
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:49,372
He won't be on it.
Laurence, look at me.

741
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:54,052
Tell me the truth.
Did you send that telegram?

742
01:02:55,612 --> 01:02:57,452
Don't lie to me, please.

743
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:01,612
What? Why? Why would you
even think such a thing?

744
01:03:01,692 --> 01:03:03,753
You've been against this
from the beginning, haven't you?

745
01:03:03,772 --> 01:03:06,571
What the hell are you talking about?
It was my idea in the first place.

746
01:03:06,652 --> 01:03:09,612
Yeah, just to humor
me, that's all.

747
01:03:09,692 --> 01:03:11,292
Now come on, admit it.

748
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,572
That's ridiculous.

749
01:03:16,451 --> 01:03:18,332
Just a doctor's trick.

750
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:21,531
A psychiatrist's trick.

751
01:03:22,652 --> 01:03:24,332
I heard what you
said on that tape.

752
01:03:25,412 --> 01:03:27,772
"Schizophrenic" something.

753
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:30,171
The only thing you're
interested in is curing me.

754
01:03:30,851 --> 01:03:33,891
I'm telling you,
I sent that telegram.

755
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:46,371
And this damn Tv!
Why don't you get it fixed?

756
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:50,771
What about that newspaper?

757
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:52,852
What newspaper?

758
01:03:53,692 --> 01:03:56,012
You said you were gonna go out
and buy a newspaper.

759
01:03:56,091 --> 01:03:57,692
Oh, you know… later.

760
01:03:57,771 --> 01:03:59,332
Go out and do it now.

761
01:04:00,012 --> 01:04:01,331
Why?

762
01:04:01,412 --> 01:04:03,052
I want to find out
what my name is.

763
01:04:03,611 --> 01:04:05,851
My name will be in that paper now.

764
01:04:05,932 --> 01:04:07,491
I want to know who I am.

765
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:10,811
- Go out and buy it. Go on.
- I don't want you reading newspapers.

766
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:12,051
They'll only upset you.

767
01:04:12,131 --> 01:04:14,051
You're in a pitiful
enough state as it is.

768
01:04:14,132 --> 01:04:15,932
I should never have
listened to you.

769
01:04:16,011 --> 01:04:18,571
I should have gone to Paris
when I first started.

770
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:20,691
All this business
would be finished by now.

771
01:04:20,771 --> 01:04:23,332
- What would have been finished by now?
- Nothing!

772
01:04:38,331 --> 01:04:40,731
Staring at that picture isn't
gonna do you any good either.

773
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:45,051
It's all I've got left.

774
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:51,011
She was my wife.

775
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:56,451
We lived together,
made love together.

776
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:00,091
Sometimes…

777
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,731
Sometimes I remember everything.

778
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:08,971
I remember… things now and then.

779
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:11,651
I remember the room.

780
01:05:12,611 --> 01:05:14,371
I remember the bed.

781
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:18,211
I remember her arms and
her shoulders. Everything.

782
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,531
Poor Frances.

783
01:06:11,691 --> 01:06:15,531
Paris, please. Littré 41-53.

784
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,371
This is 78-91.

785
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,170
How long will it take?

786
01:06:24,171 --> 01:06:25,330
I'll hold on then.

787
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,290
Hello? Hello?

788
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:37,530
I'd like to speak
to Mrs. Frances Jeffries, please.

789
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,370
<i>S'il vous plait,</i> Madame Jeffries.

790
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,890
This is the Hotel Bonaparte?

791
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:52,170
Do you have any
guests called Damien?

792
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,810
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Damien?

793
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,850
I see.

794
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,610
They're out at the moment.

795
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,970
Yes. No, no…

796
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:11,570
No message for Mrs. Damien.

797
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,170
<i>Have you finished your call, sir?</i>

798
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:23,210
When are the cleaners
going to bring back my suit?

799
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,570
Tomorrow.

800
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,929
I would like to have worn it
for my meeting with Damien.

801
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,250
Will I recognize him?

802
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:36,250
Well, maybe the shock
of seeing him again.

803
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:39,450
He'll recognize me.

804
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:44,330
I doubt that. It was very dark
when he attacked you in that fog.

805
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:49,290
I wonder what really happened on the
beach that night. I'll ask him.

806
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:52,249
He'll deny it. You can't expect him
to hand over a full confession.

807
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,969
I wish I could remember.

808
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,369
What about the newspaper?

809
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:10,410
Hold it.
It may be one of my patients.

810
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:15,169
Dr. Jeffries' residence.

811
01:08:16,129 --> 01:08:17,129
Speaking.

812
01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:20,050
Who is this?

813
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:23,450
Where are you calling from?

814
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:27,769
Yes. I'll be expecting you.

815
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:31,369
Well, right away.

816
01:08:32,449 --> 01:08:35,690
What? Yes. I'm alone.

817
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:49,289
It's him.

818
01:08:50,969 --> 01:08:52,649
What was that gibberish?

819
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:54,329
French. It'll put him at ease.

820
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:56,609
Why didn't you let me talk to him?

821
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:58,889
You will.

822
01:09:01,769 --> 01:09:02,769
He's coming?

823
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:06,729
Right now.
He's in a pub down the road.

824
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:28,009
Ask him about Frances immediately.

825
01:09:28,088 --> 01:09:30,369
That's the point of all
this, isn't it?

826
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:36,409
And take that off.

827
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:04,689
- Yes?
- He's going to lie to you.

828
01:10:04,769 --> 01:10:06,689
- Don't let that throw you.
- I won't.

829
01:10:07,768 --> 01:10:08,889
Where will you be?

830
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:10,689
I'll be around.

831
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:35,608
Paul Damien.

832
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:40,489
Come in.

833
01:10:47,688 --> 01:10:50,648
I know I look shabby.
My suit's at the cleaners.

834
01:10:56,288 --> 01:10:58,049
You're about what I expected.

835
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:01,088
What do you do for a living?
Tango dancer?

836
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:02,248
I'm a journalist.

837
01:11:06,288 --> 01:11:08,488
Your brother-in-law
said you wanted to talk to me.

838
01:11:09,568 --> 01:11:11,728
My what? Brother-in-law?

839
01:11:11,808 --> 01:11:13,848
Yes. Andrew.

840
01:11:15,808 --> 01:11:18,328
Frances' brother.
You sent him to me.

841
01:11:19,528 --> 01:11:20,568
Remember?

842
01:11:22,888 --> 01:11:24,368
Of course I remember.

843
01:11:25,168 --> 01:11:29,128
And I want to talk to you.
Don't you want to talk to me?

844
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:33,488
Look, he tells me you intend
to discuss this matter calmly,

845
01:11:33,568 --> 01:11:36,288
with a minimum of unpleasantness.

846
01:11:36,368 --> 01:11:38,128
Good. I'm all for that.

847
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:40,128
Do you really think
that's possible?

848
01:11:40,447 --> 01:11:41,568
Frankly, I don't know.

849
01:11:43,848 --> 01:11:47,128
We have a score to settle,
Damien, you and me.

850
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:50,167
I warned him it might
turn into a brawl.

851
01:11:50,248 --> 01:11:52,247
What the hell did you expect
after what you did?

852
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:53,288
What have I done?

853
01:11:54,248 --> 01:11:55,888
You committed a crime.

854
01:11:56,808 --> 01:11:58,488
I made Frances happy.

855
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:00,808
Something you were
never able to do.

856
01:12:00,887 --> 01:12:03,128
Is that the crime
you're accusing me of?

857
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:06,168
You sound as if you
did her a favor.

858
01:12:06,247 --> 01:12:08,528
You're a monster!

859
01:12:08,608 --> 01:12:10,168
What are you talking about?

860
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,088
Well, I'm not talking
about sleeping with her.

861
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:14,167
And I'm not talking
about "making her happy"!

862
01:12:14,248 --> 01:12:15,847
I'm talking about murder!

863
01:12:15,928 --> 01:12:17,128
- Murder?
- Yes, murder.

864
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,567
And I know why you did it.

865
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:21,607
She was coming back to me,
so you killed her.

866
01:12:21,688 --> 01:12:22,768
Killed Frances?

867
01:12:22,847 --> 01:12:24,448
"Killed Frances."

868
01:12:24,528 --> 01:12:25,928
Yes!

869
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:29,567
And now you stand there and want
to discuss the matter calmly.

870
01:12:29,648 --> 01:12:31,647
What you're trying to do
is weasel your way out.

871
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,007
But I'm not going to let you.

872
01:12:33,088 --> 01:12:36,327
But nobody's killed Frances.
What kind of insanity is this?

873
01:12:36,928 --> 01:12:38,288
She's not dead.

874
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:43,047
She's not dead?

875
01:12:43,127 --> 01:12:44,567
Of course not.

876
01:12:44,647 --> 01:12:47,167
For God's sake, she's right here.

877
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:52,087
- Where?
- Do you actually think I killed Frances?

878
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:54,608
Where is she?

879
01:12:54,687 --> 01:12:55,807
She's in the car.

880
01:13:02,687 --> 01:13:03,647
Look.

881
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:21,607
Now what is all this?

882
01:13:22,727 --> 01:13:23,967
Bring her in.

883
01:13:24,407 --> 01:13:26,367
No, let's keep her out of it.

884
01:13:27,647 --> 01:13:29,327
This is between the two of us.

885
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:32,087
You bring her in.

886
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:36,807
And don't you try to run away
or I'll shoot you.

887
01:13:36,887 --> 01:13:38,047
Now go ahead.

888
01:14:01,367 --> 01:14:02,767
He wants to see you.

889
01:14:02,847 --> 01:14:04,407
Well, I don't want to see him.

890
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:06,407
He has a gun.

891
01:14:06,486 --> 01:14:08,446
- You must be joking.
- No, I'm not.

892
01:14:37,526 --> 01:14:38,687
Who is he?

893
01:14:39,446 --> 01:14:40,646
He isn't Larry.

894
01:14:41,326 --> 01:14:44,206
- Damien, you keep your hands off her.
- He isn't Larry.

895
01:14:44,286 --> 01:14:45,707
Take your hands off her.
Now close that door.

896
01:14:45,726 --> 01:14:46,686
Who is he?

897
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:48,806
- Damien, close the door.
- What's he doing here?

898
01:14:50,646 --> 01:14:51,806
Frances, come over here.

899
01:14:53,647 --> 01:14:54,887
Do as he says.

900
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:05,326
Now, tell him.

901
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,246
Come on. Tell him.

902
01:15:10,366 --> 01:15:11,526
Tell him what?

903
01:15:12,366 --> 01:15:15,327
That it's all over.
You know, you two.

904
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:16,806
Just tell him it's finished.

905
01:15:19,246 --> 01:15:20,486
It's finished, Paul.

906
01:15:21,886 --> 01:15:23,566
Tell him you love your husband.

907
01:15:24,966 --> 01:15:26,206
I love my husband.

908
01:15:29,966 --> 01:15:32,246
Now, tell him to get
the hell out of here.

909
01:15:35,886 --> 01:15:36,846
Go on.

910
01:15:38,846 --> 01:15:40,166
Get out, Paul.

911
01:15:40,845 --> 01:15:43,526
Yeah.
You heard what she said, huh?

912
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:47,206
Now, you go away
and leave us alone.

913
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:50,646
Yes, I'm going. But…

914
01:15:51,566 --> 01:15:53,006
But, hell. Out.

915
01:15:54,526 --> 01:15:55,606
Can I talk to her?

916
01:15:56,006 --> 01:15:56,966
No!

917
01:15:57,646 --> 01:15:58,685
Just for a moment.

918
01:15:58,766 --> 01:16:00,566
No, you can't.

919
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:03,046
Please.

920
01:16:07,686 --> 01:16:10,205
All right. Okay…

921
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:19,446
Humor him. I'll get help.

922
01:16:21,045 --> 01:16:23,245
I heard that!
I heard what you said!

923
01:16:23,966 --> 01:16:25,246
All right. I'm leaving.

924
01:16:25,325 --> 01:16:26,645
The hell you are.

925
01:16:26,726 --> 01:16:30,286
You told her you were going to meet
her someplace, didn't you? Where?

926
01:16:30,365 --> 01:16:35,006
The Hotel Bonaparte in Paris the
next time my back's turned, right?

927
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:36,046
Go.

928
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,965
You're not running away from me,
are you, Frances?

929
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:01,525
Don't. Please don't.

930
01:17:01,606 --> 01:17:04,245
Don't you understand,
I've forgiven you.

931
01:17:05,085 --> 01:17:07,045
But you did go back to him.

932
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:09,365
After going all the way to Paris
to bring you home,

933
01:17:09,445 --> 01:17:11,405
and after all your promises,
back you went.

934
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:14,805
But it doesn't matter. Everything
is going to be all right now.

935
01:17:16,686 --> 01:17:20,126
Don't you realize?
You just killed a man.

936
01:17:21,245 --> 01:17:22,925
What the hell
difference does it make?

937
01:17:23,006 --> 01:17:24,165
You're alive.

938
01:17:28,405 --> 01:17:29,725
You're alive…

939
01:17:32,245 --> 01:17:33,725
That woman on the beach…

940
01:17:35,565 --> 01:17:36,805
It wasn't you.

941
01:17:38,685 --> 01:17:40,765
I thought that…

942
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,925
I don't know what
the hell I thought.

943
01:17:51,165 --> 01:17:54,964
Frances, you see, my brain
has been in such a chaos.

944
01:17:57,925 --> 01:18:00,044
We can start all over again.

945
01:18:01,485 --> 01:18:05,445
We'll take it right from the
beginning, and start brand-new.

946
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:13,885
Now that you're here, Frances, I
won't need this photograph anymore.

947
01:18:13,965 --> 01:18:16,244
We can save it as a souvenir.

948
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:18,405
You know, when Laurence
went out to send the cable,

949
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,884
- I was looking…
- Laurence! Where is Laurence?

950
01:18:20,965 --> 01:18:23,804
Frances, if you only knew
how much I've needed you.

951
01:18:24,884 --> 01:18:26,804
Seems like such a long time.

952
01:18:28,005 --> 01:18:31,285
I need you now, Frances.
I really need you.

953
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,324
I want you, Frances.

954
01:18:41,845 --> 01:18:42,844
No!

955
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:44,965
No! Let go!

956
01:18:45,044 --> 01:18:47,445
You mustn't run away from me.
You keep running away from me.

957
01:18:50,205 --> 01:18:51,644
Please don't make me.

958
01:19:07,684 --> 01:19:09,724
Let me go!

959
01:19:41,804 --> 01:19:43,004
No!

960
01:20:16,923 --> 01:20:19,444
No! Let me--

961
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:27,404
You tried to kill me.
And I'm your husband.

962
01:20:28,244 --> 01:20:31,244
You're my wife. You're my wife.

963
01:20:32,683 --> 01:20:33,963
You're my wife.

964
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:35,603
You're my wife.

965
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:40,643
You're my wife. You're my wife!

966
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:43,884
She's not your wife.

967
01:21:05,164 --> 01:21:08,164
You see, you said this is my wife.

968
01:21:09,124 --> 01:21:10,123
And that's her.

969
01:21:14,563 --> 01:21:18,163
I'm afraid you'll have to leave
now. The consultation is over.

970
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:27,043
Okay, okay,
but I'm going to take my wife.

971
01:21:27,123 --> 01:21:29,363
I told you she's not your wife.

972
01:21:38,883 --> 01:21:41,403
Then… where is my wife?

973
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:45,763
Why don't you try East
Cliff Beach? Remember?

974
01:21:53,123 --> 01:21:54,523
East Cliff Beach.

975
01:21:56,443 --> 01:21:59,683
Okay, East Cliff Beach.

976
01:22:07,283 --> 01:22:08,763
I don't know what I'm going to do.

977
01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:28,283
You're a doctor.
You're supposed to help people.

978
01:22:53,282 --> 01:22:54,482
Who was that man?

979
01:22:54,563 --> 01:22:56,442
He was a patient. An amnesiac.

980
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:58,163
He… he killed a woman.

981
01:22:58,242 --> 01:23:00,363
He won't get far.
The police are looking for him.

982
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:10,042
How long have you
known about Paul?

983
01:23:14,402 --> 01:23:15,362
Quite a while.

984
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:20,562
Let's get this straight.
You gave him that photograph.

985
01:23:20,643 --> 01:23:22,882
I gave him everything.
The whole story.

986
01:23:26,563 --> 01:23:27,523
Including you.

987
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:30,403
You made him believe
I was his wife.

988
01:23:30,482 --> 01:23:32,522
I kept out of it completely.

989
01:23:33,162 --> 01:23:35,322
All I needed was someone
to pull the trigger.

990
01:23:35,402 --> 01:23:37,202
How did you make him do that?

991
01:23:47,162 --> 01:23:48,362
What are you doing?

992
01:23:51,602 --> 01:23:54,482
Sergeant Gordon?
This is Dr. Jeffries.

993
01:23:55,762 --> 01:23:58,801
I'm afraid I have
some very bad news for you.

994
01:23:58,882 --> 01:24:02,802
That man you're looking for just shot
and killed someone over at my house.

995
01:24:05,521 --> 01:24:06,481
Thank you.

996
01:24:09,882 --> 01:24:12,241
You think the police
will buy that story?

997
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:15,082
It makes perfect sense.

998
01:24:15,162 --> 01:24:17,402
A dangerous patient
followed me home,

999
01:24:17,482 --> 01:24:19,642
broke into the house
and started shooting.

1000
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,282
I can tell him the truth.

1001
01:24:22,801 --> 01:24:25,442
You lured Paul here
to have him killed.

1002
01:24:25,522 --> 01:24:28,082
- Andrew is my witness.
- No, Frances.

1003
01:24:28,161 --> 01:24:30,882
He'll confirm that I asked Paul
here to talk about the divorce.

1004
01:24:30,962 --> 01:24:32,401
Andrew is my witness.

1005
01:24:38,562 --> 01:24:39,961
So you succeeded.

1006
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,682
Or you think you succeeded.

1007
01:24:45,682 --> 01:24:47,682
You've been working
overtime again, haven't you?

1008
01:24:48,601 --> 01:24:50,241
You certainly keep busy.

1009
01:24:50,322 --> 01:24:52,962
Sixteen hours a day
at the hospital.

1010
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:56,122
Three hours homework
with your notes and your files.

1011
01:24:56,202 --> 01:24:57,722
Oh, yes. I almost forgot.

1012
01:24:58,321 --> 01:25:01,322
Three or four minutes with me occasionally
in bed, when you feel up to it.

1013
01:25:01,401 --> 01:25:04,241
A quick one, anybody,
before the next operation.

1014
01:25:04,322 --> 01:25:07,521
You're so conscientious
about everything you do.

1015
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,482
But you're not quite
conscientious enough.

1016
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:13,522
You've been neglecting one
of your patients, Dr. Jeffries.

1017
01:25:13,601 --> 01:25:17,082
In fact, her case history
isn't even recorded in your files.

1018
01:25:17,161 --> 01:25:19,601
Your bloody files!

1019
01:25:20,802 --> 01:25:23,601
Taking you up to date
in your gallery of freaks.

1020
01:25:30,361 --> 01:25:33,402
A murder. How clever.

1021
01:25:34,281 --> 01:25:36,001
A dilettante masterpiece.

1022
01:25:37,081 --> 01:25:40,282
But didn't it ever occur to you that
it might have been unnecessary?

1023
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:42,602
Ask yourself…

1024
01:25:42,681 --> 01:25:45,921
in all the time you've spent
dreaming up this…

1025
01:25:46,881 --> 01:25:48,881
this nightmare,

1026
01:25:48,961 --> 01:25:52,041
how often have you thought of me
and asked yourself, "Why?"

1027
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:53,722
Not once. Admit it.

1028
01:25:54,281 --> 01:25:59,921
You see, as usual, you've been much too
preoccupied with more important things.

1029
01:26:04,841 --> 01:26:06,441
You know something?

1030
01:26:06,521 --> 01:26:09,041
It's not only been
a second-hand murder, Larry.

1031
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,441
It's been a second-hand
marriage too.

1032
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,480
It's a full confession.

1033
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,160
You can play it to the police
when they come.

1034
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,280
It's up to you.

1035
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,960
I'm guilty.

1036
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,000
You're guilty of being a fool.
