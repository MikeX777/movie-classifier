00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:59,914
Is it my turn now?

7
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,669
So it's me?

What are you?

13
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:28,551
I'm me. What else should I be?

14
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:31,550
That's a big word: Me

15
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,993
I am what I am.
- And what are you?

LINE PRODUCER

22
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:49,668
You are affected. You are vain.

23
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:52,635
You are conceited. You are ignorant.

24
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:55,391
You are self-satisfied. You are coquettish.

25
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:02,107
So what am I meant to do?

26
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,116
Be it.

When am I vain? When am I coquettish?

32
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:14,951
Always.

33
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:21,072
As soon as a man is around
you start acting differently.

34
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:22,466
In what way?

35
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,867
Your walk. Your expression.

36
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,789
Just everything.

37
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:31,629
She who aims to make men fall for her
is already a fallen woman.

38
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:34,274
So what do I have to do?

39
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,190
Be what you are.

40
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,713
Only then will you be one of us.

41
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:59,352
And then the German armed forces
abandoned these barracks.

42
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,436
And you rented them?

43
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:12,589
No, we squatted them.

44
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,748
Come on, I'll show you.

EXILE PARADISE
ANGEL CLUB

46
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,796
"August 14th."

47
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:28,549
I was 19 then.

48
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:34,915
"I was in the woods with Stephan today,
and we talked a lot about elves.

49
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:39,275
He said we could see fairies and elves
in the clearing at full moon.

50
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:43,394
I though Stephan was cute
and wanted to kiss him.

51
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,585
But I didn't do it,
in case he thought I was trying

52
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:49,555
to ruin his relationship with Katrin.
- Ooh!

53
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:53,714
Did you manage to get him,
or did you just chase elves?

54
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,868
Of course I got him,

55
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:59,188
but I didn't write it in my diary.
- Why not?

56
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:03,471
So that no one could read it.

57
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,468
But who should read your diary?

58
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,434
I often showed it to people.

59
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:11,476
I thought people write diaries
just for themselves?

60
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,592
I did.

61
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:15,035
But I wanted to show it to people too.

62
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,595
But always prefaced with:

63
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:22,273
"You are the only person
I show my diary to."

64
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:25,107
Right?
- Yes.

65
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,751
But I wrote it for myself, as well.

66
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,466
Do you want to hear more?
- No.

67
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:37,868
I'll leave them here.
You can read them.

68
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,588
My life.

69
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:12,586
So you wrote the same letter to both of them?
- Yes.

70
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:15,146
Word for word?
- More or less.

71
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:19,029
What does that mean?
Yes or no?

72
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:22,588
The greeting was...
- But the content was identical?

73
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:26,266
I felt the same way about both of them.

74
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,627
Did they know each other?

75
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,516
They were best friends.
- Who didn't talk to each other?

76
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:39,237
Sure they did.
What are you trying to say?

77
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:43,185
So don't you think
they talked about your letters?

78
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:47,316
Yes... But I felt the same way
about both of them.

79
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:51,191
Besides, it was quicker that way.
- I see.

80
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:01,586
Welcome to the underworld.

81
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:18,232
Did you think up the text,
or did you copy it?

82
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:23,150
It was mine, partly.
Or things I'd read somewhere.

83
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,191
Or from letters you'd received.

84
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:31,792
How do you know that?
- I just know.

85
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:34,868
And you only did it with those two?

86
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:38,189
Well, no.

87
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:42,355
Love-recycling.
- I see.

88
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:10,665
I'll write it down, otherwise it'll get lost.

89
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:16,068
What's your problem? It's just
the way I felt. I think it's normal.

90
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:18,228
It depends what you consider normal.

91
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:22,310
So you told them all the same thing?

92
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:23,466
No.

93
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:26,915
Yes. That is...
- Yes,

94
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:30,353
or no? Is it so difficult?

95
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:31,711
You are...

96
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,030
You analyse my every word.

97
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:37,950
Anyway, I said it to most of them,
but not all of them.

98
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:40,468
So how many are we talking about?

99
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:43,351
Dozens or hundreds?

100
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,231
Maybe about 80.

101
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:48,468
80?

102
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,353
I can't put an exact number on it.

103
00:15:55,317 --> 00:16:00,789
Alright, you write it all down,
and you dictate, nice and slowly.

104
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:05,026
"I never...

105
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,946
liked kissing anyone...

106
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:11,393
as much as I do you.

107
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:16,154
You have the...

108
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:19,106
most sexy cock...

109
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:21,152
I have...

110
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:22,909
ever seen.

111
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,554
I never felt...

112
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:31,706
as horny...

113
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:34,309
as I do with you.

114
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:39,706
I think I have fallen in love...

115
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:41,469
with you."

116
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:43,470
Got that?
- Yep.

117
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:45,355
Is that all?
- No.

118
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:48,789
I used more crude lines at the disco,
since you have to shout there.

119
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:51,914
The subtleties go out of the window.

120
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:48,950
And you get this as well.

121
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:58,912
When do I get my Spyder back?

122
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:02,112
When you've proven yourself.

123
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,512
Am I meant to walk in the meantime?

124
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:43,106
<i>I know everything, to the dash and dot,</i>
<i>except one thing, that's me, me, me,</i>

125
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:10,591
"July 11th." She was 20.

126
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:14,226
"I think Tobias is mega-cute.

127
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:17,628
His father is a doctor
and they have a great house.

128
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:21,915
He's still together with Margarete,
but I think she bores him.

129
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,227
I think my chances are quite good.

130
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:28,515
He studies History.
His specialist area is the Celts.

131
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:32,431
I have to buy a book about the Celts.
I'm sure he'll like that.

132
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:35,475
The things you do when you're in love!"

133
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:51,593
"Christmas." She was 22.

134
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,472
"Drove to my parents with Markus.

135
00:19:55,637 --> 00:20:00,916
In the evening we walked in the forest
and I showed him the magical elf places.

136
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:05,229
But he left the next day.
I felt pretty stupid.

137
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:09,993
Who could I go to Mucki's party with?
Going alone is shit.

138
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:12,830
I'll have to call Andreas.
Maybe he's free.

139
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:16,353
I don't find him as attractive,
but that could change.

140
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,190
Or I could call Stephan.
He'd be really pleased."

141
00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:51,153
"May 4th." She was 25.

142
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:55,833
"I met a great Latin American guy.
We kissed a lot.

143
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:59,512
Unfortunately, I forgot to ask him his name.
Shit!

144
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:02,316
He was so cute!

145
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:07,597
I went to the Salsa party in the hope
of seeing him again, but he wasn't there.

146
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:10,876
Instead, I met Juan.

147
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:16,430
He isn't as great as the nameless guy,
but he has mega-wicked tattoos.

148
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:19,430
He even has a dragon on his ass.

149
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:21,189
I think that's cool!

150
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:22,506
He calls me

151
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:27,592
his 'princess' and is in love with me.
I'm in love with him too."

152
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:31,587
Did she fuck her way
through the whole republic?

153
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,112
While chasing elves at the same time.

154
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:36,666
On the asses of Latin Americans.

155
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:43,270
Why do you think
she gave us this crap to read?

156
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:46,395
So we can learn more about her, she says.

157
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:48,389
I see.

158
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:50,674
I have one more entry.

159
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:53,234
A really good one.

160
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:57,187
"Easter." She was 23.

161
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:01,471
"I was at a peace camp
with the Anthroposophists.

162
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:05,073
We sung nice songs
and celebrated an Easter ritual,

163
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:07,512
with a floral altar
and the blessing of fruit.

164
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:09,827
I'm rooming with Christian,
who is gay, unfortunately,

165
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:14,912
Andrea, Birgit, Johannes and Marius,
in a very romantic wooden cabin.

166
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:18,433
Johannes really fancies Andrea. Shit.

167
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,713
And she has such a terrible figure!

168
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:24,187
I wanted to cuddle with Marius
but he was in bed with Chris.

169
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:27,952
In the end, I masturbated.
But it didn't work.

170
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:34,507
I took a stroll through the peace camp
and met a peace friend from Spain.

171
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,747
Mega-cute!

172
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:40,990
He thinks I have a good figure.
I think he's fallen in love with me."

173
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:43,987
Oh stop, please!

174
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:45,954
Reading broadens the mind.

175
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:31,627
<i>I know everything, to the dash and dot,</i>

176
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:36,394
<i>except one thing, that's me, me, me,</i>

177
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:27,388
The best spot is still beside our lake.

178
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,507
At least we don't get sunburn.

179
00:24:33,197 --> 00:24:34,789
Sunshine is shit.

180
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:46,633
I hope you know me a bit better
after having read my diaries.

181
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,071
You might say that.

182
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:51,396
We now know

183
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:53,867
that you find men sexy
who will inherit big houses.

184
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:57,069
And Latin Americans.
- If...

185
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,949
they have dragons on their ass.

186
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:04,345
And that you fall in love with anything
that has something between its legs.

187
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:09,434
That no one should trust you,
and that you're dishonest

188
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:12,157
to everybody.
- Especially to yourself.

189
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:15,987
That you drop phrases like cow pats.

190
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:22,711
Don't my diaries tell you anything else?

191
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,628
Yes, they are badly written.

192
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,911
One sentence would have been enough.

193
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,236
And what would that be?

194
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:39,274
"I am a lying, horny slut."

195
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:50,588
So what do you think I should do?

196
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:54,873
Be a lying, horny slut.

197
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:58,029
I fuck, therefore I am.

198
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:11,788
It's always so lovely
to sit together like this.

199
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:36,794
<i>I fuck, therefore I am,</i>

200
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:43,396
<i>I fuck anyone and everyone,</i>

201
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:59,630
You call these horny pictures?

202
00:27:59,797 --> 00:28:00,991
Yes.

203
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:04,505
You're such a country girl!

204
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:08,506
Then I'll get some new ones taken.

205
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:18,429
Where she comes from,
this is called 'pornography'.

206
00:28:43,877 --> 00:28:46,391
Stand by what you are.
- How?

207
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:50,428
You shall know them by their actions.
- Not by their babble.

208
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:54,308
What if I don't know what I am?
- Then you're just a question mark.

209
00:28:57,757 --> 00:28:59,748
Do you two know what you are?

210
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:04,594
We are angels...
who are forced to believe they are humans.

211
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:13,347
But I can't see any wings.

212
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:18,430
Stand by what you are,
and you'll get some too.

213
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,872
You can only see them at night,

214
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:25,951
so that humans don't cut them off.

215
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:46,312
That was a poor performance.

216
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:00,672
You want me to do ballet poses while fucking?

217
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:06,266
He's probably forgotten you already.

218
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:09,873
Where was the seduction?

219
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:14,194
What happened to the madness
you would drive him to?

220
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,034
So what am I supposed to do?

221
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:24,315
It was you who said you drive men crazy,
and that they're drawn to you like flies.

222
00:35:31,357 --> 00:35:33,871
So where are they all?

223
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:40,435
Did you at least get his number?
- Yes.

224
00:35:44,037 --> 00:35:46,631
Then call him and make a date to meet.

225
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:49,391
But then we want to see real madness.

226
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:53,311
If it'd been in a different atmosphere
I'd have got him.

227
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:56,628
Then fuck him in bed.
I'm quite sure he has one.

228
00:35:56,797 --> 00:35:59,994
And you'll spy on me again with a telescope?
- No.

229
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:03,589
This time we'll use
more advanced technology.

230
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:46,268
Truth is a mirror.

231
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:49,950
All it can reflect is itself.

232
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:53,353
Most people look into this truth,

233
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,394
but they can't see it.

234
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:58,988
They don't want to see it.

235
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:01,866
Why not?

236
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:06,266
Because they've created
an image of themselves

237
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:10,189
which has nothing to do with reality.

238
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,673
They don't need the truth.
- I do.

239
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:22,666
As long as the fog of self-deception

240
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:28,116
lies between you and your mirror image,
you'll remain unknowing.

241
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:33,710
Look in your mirror.

242
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:38,549
What do you see?

243
00:37:43,357 --> 00:37:47,111
A narcissistic, greedy little whore.

244
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:52,991
What should I do?

245
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:57,194
Be a whore.

246
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:00,951
A real whore? For money and all that?

247
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:02,709
A whore, that's all.

248
00:38:05,357 --> 00:38:07,552
The world is a brothel.

249
00:38:13,277 --> 00:38:19,989
<i>Ole, we're off to the brothel in Barcelona!</i>

250
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:22,507
<i>Ole, ole!</i>

251
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:30,791
<i>Ole, we're off to the brothel in Barcelona!</i>

252
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:34,996
<i>Ole, ole!</i>

253
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,948
Do you want another drink?

254
00:45:51,557 --> 00:45:54,549
At first it was just a game at the lake.

255
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:59,747
But when I got home
I couldn't get you out of my head.

256
00:46:00,997 --> 00:46:03,591
I couldn't get your face out of my head.

257
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:21,189
<i>Your eyes are so deep and gentle,</i>

258
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:27,231
<i>I think I've fallen in love with you,</i>

259
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:37,512
Love is a big word.

260
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:43,591
And I've only said it twice in my life.

261
00:46:46,997 --> 00:46:48,988
<i>Love is like a knife,</i>

262
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,395
<i>It can cut away all your worries and fears,</i>

263
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:59,868
or it can stab you
and almost tear you apart.

264
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:08,786
You've had bad experiences.

265
00:47:10,877 --> 00:47:16,156
I can see it in the way you look.
In your hurt, gentle eyes.

266
00:47:18,517 --> 00:47:23,193
I simply don't dare get involved in anything

267
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,791
that goes beyond sexuality.

268
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:33,312
With you, I feel things
that I've never felt before.

269
00:47:33,997 --> 00:47:36,716
I've never been so turned on by a man
as I am by you.

270
00:47:36,877 --> 00:47:41,587
It's a horniness that goes beyond
the physical. A horniness for your soul.

271
00:47:43,477 --> 00:47:47,595
You have the most sexy cock I have ever seen.

272
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:52,475
<i>And even if you didn't have one,</i>
<i>I'd still be hot for you,</i>

273
00:47:53,157 --> 00:47:55,352
<i>Because it is a soul-horniness,</i>

274
00:47:57,997 --> 00:47:59,988
<i>I think we are soul mates,</i>

275
00:48:03,237 --> 00:48:05,034
When I kiss you...

276
00:48:14,797 --> 00:48:18,585
When I kiss you it feels like
I'm drawing your soul into me.

277
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:23,590
As if our souls, which had to live apart
for so long, were united.

278
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,908
You'll only hurt me.

279
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:40,346
I know that, and I fear it.

280
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:45,395
Hurting you would mean hurting myself.

281
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:48,154
Look at me: Am I lying?

282
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,714
<i>I can't tell,</i>

283
00:48:58,077 --> 00:48:59,669
I can understand that.

284
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:04,349
I always got used by people too.

285
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:08,269
<i>I was always the victim,</i>
<i>but too dumb to realise it,</i>

286
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:18,825
I'll tell you a secret
that I've never told anyone before.

287
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:24,312
I've never had an orgasm.

288
00:49:28,557 --> 00:49:30,548
The first one was with you, at the lake.

289
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:40,191
I love you.

290
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:47,471
I...

291
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:49,829
I like you.

292
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:51,836
Very much.

293
00:49:52,597 --> 00:49:54,588
Maybe even more than that.

294
00:51:02,877 --> 00:51:05,345
Because of the money. Why else?

295
00:51:05,517 --> 00:51:07,553
Just for the turn-on.

296
00:51:07,717 --> 00:51:09,514
For the turn-on?

297
00:51:09,677 --> 00:51:12,475
Don't you see
the turned-on looks they give me?

298
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:16,232
How hot they are for me?
- They're hot for anything with a hole.

299
00:51:21,157 --> 00:51:23,352
I draw their power into myself.

300
00:51:24,557 --> 00:51:26,991
When a man comes,
he gives up his sexual energy.

301
00:51:27,157 --> 00:51:29,717
And I absorb that power.

302
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:32,628
Maybe your clients are different.

303
00:51:33,277 --> 00:51:36,952
I only absorb their beer breath
and their slimy fingers.

304
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:39,073
So you never get turned on?

305
00:51:40,237 --> 00:51:41,226
Never.

306
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:42,796
Too bad.

307
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:44,466
No.

308
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:46,150
Luckily.

309
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,631
I'd like to hold on to a bit of privacy.

310
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:54,386
Horniness is part of my private life.

311
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:58,273
I don't want to live it out here.

312
00:51:58,437 --> 00:52:01,952
I see this as a part of me.
A part of my life.

313
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:03,906
Really?

314
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:08,267
For me, it would just be
a dirty piece of life.

315
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:10,994
And that's what makes me hot.

316
00:54:29,757 --> 00:54:32,749
You have to keep pumping
until all the air is out.

317
00:54:33,957 --> 00:54:39,668
When it's empty... we close the bottom
and put brake fluid in at the top.

318
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:44,788
Pump it until no more bubbles come out.
So there's no more air in the system.

319
00:54:45,237 --> 00:54:49,116
Then put on the seal and the cap,
and tighten it up.

320
00:54:49,277 --> 00:54:50,790
Then it should work.

321
00:54:55,277 --> 00:55:01,546
It's maybe a lot to do with the media.
The youth let it wash over them.

322
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:07,633
There's less exchange of ideas,
less conversation. It's somehow getting lost.

323
00:55:07,797 --> 00:55:12,154
When you just sit alone in your room
and let it all wash over you,

324
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:14,785
you grow isolated and get dumbed down.

325
00:55:14,957 --> 00:55:19,189
That's actually the main reason
that we're together in our club.

326
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:26,274
To have an exchange, to talk and listen.
- Right. "Listening", as you said earlier.

327
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:29,952
It's becoming rare to meet people
who are able to listen,

328
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:33,189
who are really interested
in what you are saying.

329
00:55:33,357 --> 00:55:37,475
I think that social skills
are developed in early childhood.

330
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:42,108
Children have to get together,
they need to play with one another.

331
00:55:42,517 --> 00:55:47,227
In the passive generation that just sits
in front of the TV or computer,

332
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:50,389
social skills start to atrophy.

333
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:09,389
This is the difference
between a Harley Davidson...

334
00:56:09,557 --> 00:56:13,436
Between American components and,
though I'm exaggerating a bit now,

335
00:56:13,597 --> 00:56:16,270
Japanese junk.

336
00:56:17,637 --> 00:56:22,267
When you get to know
other countries and people...

337
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:25,671
it's maybe something you've missed.

338
00:56:25,837 --> 00:56:30,433
Rather than staying at your own level,
you take other experiences on board.

339
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:32,906
You have to judge for yourself
whether it's good or bad.

340
00:56:33,077 --> 00:56:37,389
When things break,
you can just throw them in the trash.

341
00:56:37,557 --> 00:56:39,991
With a Harley you can fix everything.

342
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:45,550
We don't go on holiday or travel
to represent our own culture,

343
00:56:45,717 --> 00:56:47,992
but to get to know other cultures.

344
00:56:48,397 --> 00:56:50,069
They're indestructible.

345
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:55,630
Is it true that you ride a Harley for 2 hours
then you have to tinker with it for 1 hour?

346
00:56:56,117 --> 00:56:59,792
Yes, it's true to a certain extent. But...

347
00:56:59,957 --> 00:57:03,711
you can easily ride for 3 hours
without having to tinker with it.

348
00:57:03,877 --> 00:57:08,826
You can tell immediately
when you meet an open person

349
00:57:08,997 --> 00:57:10,225
who's travelled and is well read.

350
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:13,275
You can also ride for 2 hours
and tinker for 1 1/2 hours.

351
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:15,792
Or someone who's constantly returned

352
00:57:15,957 --> 00:57:18,755
to the same camp site in Bibione
for 40 years.

353
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:22,148
Or tinker for 3 hours and ride for 1/2 an hour.

354
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:23,909
Then you'll get to know things.

355
00:57:24,077 --> 00:57:26,352
Or ride for 1 hour and tinker for 2 hours.

356
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:29,793
And when you get back
you have something to tell people.

357
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,870
It's great to see the Pyramids and stuff,

358
00:57:33,037 --> 00:57:34,993
but when you talk to the locals,
it's a different thing.

359
00:57:35,157 --> 00:57:37,307
Or ride for 2 hours and tinker for 2 hours.

360
00:57:37,477 --> 00:57:39,752
Then you can put yourself in their shoes.

361
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:44,388
With a Harley engine you can always ride
more kilometres than with a Japanese one.

362
00:57:44,557 --> 00:57:47,629
Harley Davidsons are legendary, a passion.

363
00:57:49,237 --> 00:57:51,876
You either love Harleys or you hate them.

364
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:55,507
Or you tinker with them.
- Yes. But if so, then with passion.

365
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:16,389
I am glad you stayed
and didn't leave with the others.

366
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:31,670
Before, with the motorbikes,
it was just a game for me.

367
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:37,426
But you are a really special person.

368
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,631
I've never felt as horny as I do with you.

369
00:59:51,957 --> 00:59:53,948
I'll tell you a secret...

370
00:59:58,117 --> 01:00:00,915
I've never had an orgasm before.

371
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:07,311
The first time was just now, with you.

372
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,871
I think I've fallen in love with you.

373
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:18,552
I feel exactly the same way.

374
01:00:33,317 --> 01:00:38,186
Imagine your life as a big, mighty river;
full of strength and energy.

375
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:44,353
And every inhibition, embarrassment,
or doubt is like a stone.

376
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:48,749
A stone that takes away the river's power,
that inhibits it.

377
01:00:51,037 --> 01:00:55,394
Then mine flows at full power,
because I hardly have any inhibitions.

378
01:00:57,037 --> 01:00:58,550
But you have morals.

379
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:02,268
I don't understand.

380
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:06,836
You are not pure.
Your actions aren't pure.

381
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,194
You gild everything
with a sugar coating of self-deception.

382
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:14,908
What do you mean by that?

383
01:01:15,957 --> 01:01:19,267
You gave us your diaries to read.

384
01:01:19,837 --> 01:01:21,634
Yes. Well?

385
01:01:22,237 --> 01:01:26,913
It's a journal of a horny bitch,
inconsiderate to everyone and everything.

386
01:01:27,077 --> 01:01:30,274
But always wrapped in the words:
"He's so cute...

387
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:34,154
I think I've fallen in love."
- So? That's how it is.

388
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:38,629
No. That's not "how it is".
It's morality.

389
01:01:38,797 --> 01:01:42,506
Morality is the excuse of those
who don't dare to live out their truth.

390
01:01:44,477 --> 01:01:46,069
But I do what I want!

391
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:50,310
You always stick contaminated explanations
onto pure deeds.

392
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:54,945
I don't understand.

393
01:01:55,117 --> 01:01:56,709
Then learn to.

394
01:01:58,477 --> 01:02:03,949
In your diaries
you wrote about that doctor's son.

395
01:02:04,117 --> 01:02:05,516
Tobias.

396
01:02:05,677 --> 01:02:08,510
Ah, yes. The "cute" Tobias.

397
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:14,674
What did you want? The house,
to be kept, and to live the good life.

398
01:02:14,837 --> 01:02:17,192
What do you call it? "Love."

399
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:20,716
That's what it's called.

400
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:25,268
Live out your pleasure, but purely.
Desire a large house, but purely.

401
01:02:25,437 --> 01:02:27,826
Deceive and swindle,
but don't deceive yourself.

402
01:02:27,997 --> 01:02:30,955
And above all, never sully the word "love".

403
01:02:31,117 --> 01:02:35,349
I thought I was supposed to cheat...
And men like hearing it.

404
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:38,077
Why do you get so upset about damned love?

405
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:41,866
If you want to achieve something, tell that
to your men. But never say it to yourself.

406
01:02:42,037 --> 01:02:43,629
Otherwise...

407
01:02:44,757 --> 01:02:46,349
Otherwise what?

408
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,188
Otherwise you'll never find it.

409
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:56,109
I don't need it.

410
01:02:57,517 --> 01:03:00,270
Except as weapon to make the men hot...

411
01:03:00,437 --> 01:03:02,189
and generous.

412
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,194
Without love,
we are empty husks in an empty world.

413
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,627
Have you found love?

414
01:03:19,077 --> 01:03:21,068
If so, would I be so empty?

415
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:51,749
So you really enjoy it here?
- Yes.

416
01:04:58,397 --> 01:04:59,386
Why?

417
01:05:03,157 --> 01:05:04,954
Because that's how I am.

418
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,950
I am...

419
01:05:10,957 --> 01:05:13,471
when I feel a dick going hard.

420
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:19,509
I am, when I feel
the horny looks directed at me.

421
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:24,666
I am, when I am being sullied.

422
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,514
You like being sullied, dirtied?

423
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,434
Dirt is life.

424
01:05:39,597 --> 01:05:41,394
And I want to live.

425
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,194
I want to be at the bottom...

426
01:07:52,597 --> 01:07:54,394
because that's where life is.

427
01:07:55,557 --> 01:07:57,548
Above, you are only being lived.

428
01:07:58,477 --> 01:08:02,026
Didn't you say you wanted to become an angel?
- Yes.

429
01:08:03,797 --> 01:08:06,186
Angels always live down here,

430
01:08:07,357 --> 01:08:09,348
because Heaven is empty.

431
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,992
In emptiness there is no lust.

432
01:08:16,797 --> 01:08:19,391
And angels are pure lust.

433
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:24,785
Unadulterated.
Not contaminated by morals and norms.

434
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:29,551
Then I don't want to become an angel.
- Then what?

435
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:31,309
I want to stay human.

436
01:08:33,797 --> 01:08:36,789
Don't you know
that humans are only castrated angels?

437
01:09:15,557 --> 01:09:21,109
<i>I know everything, to the dash and dot,</i>
<i>except one thing, that's me, me, me,</i>

438
01:09:21,277 --> 01:09:26,795
<i>I know everything, to the dash and dot,</i>
<i>except one thing, that's me, me, me,</i>

439
01:09:38,077 --> 01:09:40,989
Can you give me
that sensitive guy's phone number?

440
01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:57,706
Here you go.

441
01:09:58,837 --> 01:10:00,793
Why do you need it?

442
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,357
So I can give him a proof of love.

443
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:15,511
<i>I know everything, to the dash and dot,</i>
<i>except one thing, that's me, me, me,</i>

444
01:10:39,237 --> 01:10:42,229
You have the most sexy cock I have ever seen.

445
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,876
I should have known.

446
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,076
She talked about elves and angels.

447
01:11:19,717 --> 01:11:21,548
And I...
- Do you know what angels are?

448
01:11:23,437 --> 01:11:26,907
The girl in the VIP room
is certainly not one.

449
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:29,265
What makes you think that?

450
01:11:31,677 --> 01:11:35,272
Don't you know that angels are survivors?

451
01:11:38,357 --> 01:11:39,949
They are survivors.

452
01:11:43,317 --> 01:11:48,596
After God had created the world he got bored.
And so did the angels.

453
01:11:49,397 --> 01:11:52,548
And as he read his own commandments,
he got even more bored.

454
01:11:52,877 --> 01:11:54,151
And so did the angels.

455
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:58,185
After he had bored a lot of angels to death,

456
01:11:58,957 --> 01:12:00,948
the survivors fled

457
01:12:01,437 --> 01:12:03,473
and now live among mankind.

458
01:12:04,837 --> 01:12:06,190
They vowed

459
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:10,786
never to suffer boredom again,

460
01:12:11,877 --> 01:12:15,506
and only to indulge in vice and pleasure.

461
01:12:18,437 --> 01:12:23,227
And God still sits bored in his paradise
and sometimes wishes...

462
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:26,026
he could be an angel too.

463
01:12:28,237 --> 01:12:30,307
Then he immediately feels ashamed,

464
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:34,387
and hopes the Pope never gets wind of it.

465
01:13:20,677 --> 01:13:22,474
What are you?

466
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:26,908
A striptease artist...

467
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,028
who also works the VIP room.

468
01:13:36,517 --> 01:13:38,155
A whore, in other words.

469
01:13:39,237 --> 01:13:40,670
Or maybe an angel?

470
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:45,315
I'm not an angel.

471
01:13:47,437 --> 01:13:48,790
And I don't want to be one.

472
01:13:52,197 --> 01:13:56,588
But if it makes you horny, I'll say it:

473
01:13:59,037 --> 01:14:01,028
I am a whore.

474
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:10,749
Was that okay?

475
01:14:17,397 --> 01:14:18,591
Thank you.

476
01:14:19,837 --> 01:14:21,236
What for?

477
01:14:22,717 --> 01:14:24,196
For the truth.

478
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:28,516
Do you want...

479
01:14:29,357 --> 01:14:30,756
even more...

480
01:14:31,797 --> 01:14:33,196
truth?

481
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:37,026
Yes.

482
01:14:41,597 --> 01:14:43,588
What do you see in my eyes?

483
01:14:44,357 --> 01:14:45,551
Nothing.

484
01:14:48,957 --> 01:14:50,151
Thank you.

485
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,148
What do you feel for me?

486
01:14:57,677 --> 01:14:58,871
Nothing.

487
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,151
Thank you.

488
01:15:08,317 --> 01:15:09,511
Thank you.

489
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:40,392
<i>There, there, little goose,</i>
<i>don't be sad, it'll soon be all right,</i>

490
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:47,428
<i>The cat has a tail,</i>
<i>it'll soon be alright,</i>

491
01:15:48,437 --> 01:15:52,032
<i>Heal, heal, bacon for the mouse,</i>

492
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,749
<i>in a hundred years it'll all be gone,</i>

493
01:15:59,957 --> 01:16:01,948
Can you say it one more time?

494
01:16:04,797 --> 01:16:06,788
I don't feel anything for you.

495
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:14,790
And I don't see anything in your eyes
that I don't see in other clients' eyes.

496
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:19,871
You are one among many.

497
01:16:22,597 --> 01:16:25,794
By tomorrow I'll have forgotten you.

498
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:29,706
Thank you.

499
01:17:10,717 --> 01:17:12,309
Am I now me?

500
01:17:15,957 --> 01:17:17,948
Or am I still just a copy?

501
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,426
Where could I have learned to feel?

502
01:17:27,237 --> 01:17:30,832
I belong to the generation
that borrows its feelings.

503
01:17:38,157 --> 01:17:39,749
During an orgasm, I am.

504
01:17:44,277 --> 01:17:47,269
Or am I only what I imagine "being"
to really be?

505
01:17:52,357 --> 01:17:54,951
What is real, for God's sake?

506
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:01,068
The world is a symbol...

507
01:18:03,357 --> 01:18:05,348
which I cannot read.

508
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,428
I want to be easy-going.

509
01:18:17,437 --> 01:18:20,429
But I feel like a question cast in lead.

510
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:27,989
Am I now me?

511
01:18:29,797 --> 01:18:31,389
Do I exist at all?

512
01:18:36,797 --> 01:18:41,791
Or was I just created as a copy
that will never see its original?

513
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:48,669
A copy doesn't know that it's a copy, right?

514
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:54,156
I don't give a fuck.

515
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,594
The main thing is: To live.

516
01:19:01,077 --> 01:19:02,874
Whatever that might mean.

517
01:19:06,397 --> 01:19:08,786
I think she has arrived, within herself.

518
01:19:09,637 --> 01:19:10,626
I think so too.

519
01:19:14,277 --> 01:19:16,871
So we should give the Spyder back to her.

01:19:24,877 --> 01:19:28,995
She gazed into the mirror
and beheld her dark reflection.
