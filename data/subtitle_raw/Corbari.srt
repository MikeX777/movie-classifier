1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,779
- How about that?
- Nice meet!

2
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,429
Or maybe it was luck.

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,870
- Just like before, huh?
- Yes, except for your uniform.

4
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:35,740
They were specially made for us!

5
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:42,740
Silvio, soon you have to decide,
what you intend to do?

6
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,810
If you start, it means
free time, girls and money.

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,969
It's totally green...!

8
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:03,149
- Why don't you want to?
- Why would I do that?

9
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,790
Get up, I said!

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,799
If you make it across
the river, you get to go.

11
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,300
What are you up to?

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,509
They shoot you..!
Go away!

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,919
I will try to stop them!

14
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,050
<font color="#15ffeb"><b>CORBARI</b></font>

15
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,500
A member of the National Guard
was murdered this afternoon..!

16
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,500
If the culprits don't
report within 24 hours...

17
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,920
<font color="#00f600"><b>"It was I, Corbari,
who killed the soldier."</b></font>

18
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,420
<font color="#00f600"><b>"He was my friend,
but that doesn't count."</b></font>

19
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:59,040
<font color="#00f600"><b>"From now on everyone
takes care of themselves."</b></font>

20
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,230
What should we do with the sign?

21
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,459
Shoot it down...!

22
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,929
What are you doing here?

23
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,210
Turn it off, I can't see a thing!

24
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,600
I appreciate your visit.
But do you think you
will find your way home?

25
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,580
What I intend to do,
I will do alone.

26
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,629
- I want to join.
- I thought so...

27
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,059
Professor, this is not for you.

28
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:33,190
You are wanted now.
The only sensible thing
is to join the partisans.

29
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,820
Go now! You don't think I'm
going back to the army, do you?

30
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:41,409
From now on, no one
will give me any orders.

31
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,210
Go back to school.

32
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,500
- What are you waiting for?
- I have finished my work!

33
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:09,629
Join the partisans and
become a tin soldier...!

34
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,710
You laugh... but the
resistance movement...

35
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,379
You don't understand...!

36
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:27,909
- The resistance movement
is our renaissance!
- What did you say?

37
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,909
It's too deep for me!

38
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:37,429
"Corbari kept joking with me.
But I was his first follower."

39
00:10:38,100 --> 00:21:15,529
"I wasn't going to leave him."

40
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,240
"Now it began...two men,
two hand grenades and a revolver..."

41
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,399
"We had known each
other for several years.
In the autumn of 1943, we not only

42
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,899
became brothers in arms,
but true friends."

43
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:45,330
"I didn't know where we were heading.
We lived from one day to another..."

44
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,460
"Like the partisans, we had to
improvise...learn from scratch."

45
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,460
"Corbari learned quickly..."

46
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,490
"It wasn't long before our
two-man army expanded..."

47
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,929
"Our second recruit was Miguel,
a convict..."

48
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,610
"Carlo and Duilio were the next two."

49
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,690
"And with them came Nicola,
a youngster we should
have sent home again."

50
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,710
"But the kid didn't want to go."

51
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,840
Quiet now...and not a sound!

52
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,440
You can't miss the bus...!

53
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,120
Are you sick, kid?

54
00:15:21,779 --> 00:30:41,899
Let me be!

55
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,720
To tell the truth, we were
probably all a little scared.

56
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,480
Cease-fire!

57
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:41,779
"We freed 50 men who were going
to concentration camps in Germany."

58
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:49,150
"They joined us. Now Corbari's
partisans were to be reckoned with."

59
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,150
"But Corbari wasn't happy.
Everything was getting harder."

60
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,599
"But his vitality
was contagious..."

61
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:38,079
Different vintages could
write their own history.

62
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,230
I can't live here any more.
Maybe I'm a coward

63
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:07,119
but perhaps you can persuade my husband
to let me go to Switzerland this winter.

64
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:27,559
This year I can supplement with
a delicious thing: Corbari 1944.

65
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:33,069
A brand new vintage...and
a very ambitious one at that.

66
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,599
I find it wasteful... not
to mention insulting!

67
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,539
On the contrary...it reveals a lot.

68
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,119
Yes, I put it on the front page...

69
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:01,539
It was the worst thing
that could have happened.
The less publicity, the better.

70
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:04,579
Especially since he seems to be
able to do good advertising on his own.

71
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:09,660
Everyone is talking about Corbari.
The workers certainly intend to strike

72
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,660
to show their approval.

73
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:25,500
- What does the government intend to do?
- These are hard times...

74
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:30,359
Corbari are still at the local
level and are therefore our enemy.

75
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,480
And as the winemaker said:

76
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,720
"Invite the enemy to party
and glam, or destroy him..."

77
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:44,660
We should probably eliminate Corbari.

78
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,140
"Underground organisations started
supplying us with arms and ammunition.

79
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,170
"Those who retrieved this avoided
detection by disguising themselves."

80
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,180
"But one day…"

81
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,500
A car has been shadowing
us for the last few kilometres.

82
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:23,210
Check out what's
in the car behind us!

83
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,119
Turn off here!

84
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,009
Get out!

85
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,630
Your papers..!

86
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,190
Inez Agostini...

87
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,779
- It says that she is studying medicine.
According to the German commander..?

88
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,359
I also work as a midwife.

89
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:54,630
- When I'm not assisting my father.
- Who is he?

90
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,539
Professor Agostini...chief
surgeon at the hospital.

91
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:01,990
Well, a real big shot...

92
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,400
We were getting worried…

93
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,319
Has something happened?

94
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:19,470
- Someone shadowed us...
- Michele and Carlo checked it out.

95
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:27,109
- Get the weapons..!
- Shouldn't Corbari go there?

96
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,670
Why did you have this
wanted notice in the car?
I think you're a spy.

97
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,630
- That's why you followed us.
- No preconceived notions now...

98
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,730
I want to join you...and I knew
about the weapons delivery.

99
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,180
- My father is also a resistance man!
- I'm sure she's a spy.

100
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:55,500
We have to get rid of her.

101
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:05,658
I'm not a spy!

102
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,329
Michele, don't shoot!

103
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,329
Are you crazy?

104
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,569
You would have murdered
her if I hadn't stopped you!

105
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,809
- She's lying! She's a spy!
- Corbari...

106
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:26,470
I have been looking for you for days!

107
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,180
Let her go...I'll find out
if she's telling the truth.

108
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:46,549
- What are you writing today?
- That Corbari and the prisoner make up...

109
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:00,569
I'd had enough. At first
it was fun to get married.

110
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,569
We were like grown up children...

111
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,849
...as long as the honeymoon lasted.

112
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:13,000
Then he started to become like my father.
Business came before everything else.

113
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,660
The marriage blew out the window…

114
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,450
I couldn't stand that.

115
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:29,170
- You were wondering what to do next?
- Not any more.

116
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,440
- Could you have killed her?
- Well, I thought she was a spy.

117
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,369
I would have shot her.

118
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:45,869
Take the car and go home now.
I tell the others that
you were allowed to go.

119
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:48,680
I intend to stay with you.

120
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:56,269
OK, but I will be
in charge of you.

121
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,799
- Don't start hanging out...
- I'll come with you up into the mountains!

122
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:08,299
Just the thought is ridiculous.

123
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,309
I don't mind, but the
others wouldn't understand.

124
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:17,349
Calm down now!

125
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,690
Be sensible...

126
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,980
Should I be sane, you should
start acting like a man!

127
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,700
Right now you're acting like shit!

128
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:37,589
Hit me again! So they get
to know what they really are!

129
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,049
- What did you find out?
- He's up in the mountains...

130
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,170
A large headquarters
with about 20 soldiers.

131
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,190
So what...we'll blast him away!

132
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:12,460
Corbari here! You have
two minutes to disappear!

133
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,990
Massimo, go and check.

134
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:50,150
They went out the back door!
We found two prisoners in the basement.

135
00:27:58,619 --> 00:27:59,849
Dad!

136
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,430
"Unbelievable, but we took the
town without firing a single shot."

137
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,230
"Apparently the name Corbari
said more than we had thought."

138
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,279
Is this what you want?

139
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,440
"I had always tried to find
out Corbari's motives."

140
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,400
"Now he had got
what he was looking for

141
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:14,839
"and we sat up all night
discussing the future of the town."

142
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,299
"His enthusiasm was so great
that nothing seemed impossible."

143
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,029
You must be Corbari? I am Juvara,
commander of the second brigade.

144
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,490
We have a lot to
deal with together.

145
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,000
I decided to occupy the
area and manage it my way.

146
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,480
- Napoleon..?
- Yes, what a man!

147
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:22,859
Call me what you will, but I
want to create a republic here.

148
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:27,769
It's an old dream. I divide
the land between the farmers.

149
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,559
You are an Alpinist...without
the Tyrolean banner.

150
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:41,019
I prefer the plains
to the mountains.

151
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,680
Outside the window I see
open landscape...and fascists.

152
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:50,440
People see me up here and see
that here you can live without fear.

153
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,990
- That's why I'm not coming with you.
- Calm down now...

154
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:59,509
We have set an example for them
and we have to agree wholeheartedly.

155
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:02,700
No, they must be allowed
to choose for themselves!

156
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:07,759
Did you hear? He wants us to go
up into the mountains and tend sheep!

157
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,099
- You are a clown..?
- Yes.

158
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,769
I'm a clown, but I perform in public.
Not behind closed doors.

159
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:26,130
- Corbari, I know I'm right.
- Convince me...

160
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:34,299
We are very few...our first
task is to organise ourselves.

161
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:38,930
The time is not right
for what you want to do.

162
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:42,420
If we don't unite, we're out.

163
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:48,480
- You're probably too stupid to understand.
- How do you measure intelligence?

164
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:55,089
Forget all the clichés...We must
raid the enemy and then escape.

165
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:02,890
- I want to get more out..!
- Teach the men to fight!

166
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,880
We must become part
of a comprehensive plan.

167
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:11,750
- What more do you want?
- There are many things.

168
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:18,180
- One thing is clear: I want more!
- He wants more...

169
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:20,900
Fanatic..!

170
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:27,630
- It is impossible to talk to you.
- Talk? You give orders!

171
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:56,319
- Stay here...
- No, you are an impossible man.

172
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,390
- You don't hate me, do you?
- Only your flaws.

173
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:12,309
- They don't know I have any.
- Good luck...

174
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:31,440
This must be our free zone.
Martino, will it work?

175
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:35,320
Sure...You know one thing?
This should have been
done a long time ago.

176
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:42,369
We need to name it...something
everyone can remember.

177
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,780
Trajano's free zone?
No, that wasn't good.

178
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,639
- "Free Zone"... but with
another name before it.
- Like Corbari..?

179
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,059
"Corbari's Free Zone"...
that sounds good, I think.

180
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:20,639
Look here, Corbari! I picked him
up on the way from the mountains!

181
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,460
- He probably doesn't like us!
- That's why the bells fell silent?

182
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,630
- What are you doing, Father?
- This is no place for me.

183
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,150
There are as many faithful
souls here as before!

184
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,429
Toll the church bells!

185
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,869
You will surely have a
large congregation today.

186
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,420
This is the first service
in this free area.

187
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,260
"Free area" means
liberated land...your own land.

188
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:54,369
- The village is yours. What day is it?
- Sunday...

189
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:00,460
- Which saint, Father?
- San Guiseppe.

190
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,849
In the future, Saint
Guiseppe will be your saint.

191
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:14,010
Each must harvest his piece,
enjoy the fruits and defend it.

192
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:23,929
For example... 40 hectares
entitles you to four rifles.

193
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,599
- How do I take care of myself?
- Nice...

194
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:35,710
My colleagues and I will liberate
new areas. Return, let's leave again.

195
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,340
We should both be
here and not be here.

196
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:45,860
Some stay and teach you.
There must be no doubt.

197
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,219
You stand on your own two feet..!

198
00:38:08,900 --> 01:16:02,119
Well done!

199
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,710
"Schoolboys want to
learn how to handle guns..."

200
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,000
"Military training every day..."

201
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,099
You won't be able
to shoot like that...

202
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:41,019
"The administration is growing,
but the procurement of
food is becoming difficult."

203
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,429
"The population is cooperating patiently."

204
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,639
"Freedom is an unexpected gift,
something one doesn't surrender easily."

205
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,449
I never learn the signature...

206
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,219
Tear it apart, I know..!

207
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,119
Who is it late? Mario Bunaldi!

208
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:20,369
"The Committee on Prosperity
has started making its own decisions

209
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:24,250
"and this to the great
delight of the local people."

210
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,070
Check out Martino...
he's happy as a lark!

211
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,239
He has come up with a new way
of describing freedom to people…

212
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,360
"...all debts and bank
loans have been settled."

213
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:45,079
Corbari, a new republic shouldn't
be burdened with debt, should it?

214
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:51,389
"The raids against the fascists are
becoming more and more common."

215
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,329
"Corbari has promised to disarm
the zone, but there are still weapons..."

216
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,760
"Tonight we had the honour
of executing three Germans."

217
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,750
"I'm beginning to realise more and
more how difficult and cruel our job is."

218
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:36,900
So, are you awake yet?

219
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,710
You're agree on the
free zone, don't you?

220
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,460
- You're not mad at me, are you?
- Don't..!

221
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,159
Something is happening now!

222
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:12,309
There are 20 of us...
Can we meet Corbari?

223
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,150
No, I want to see Corbari dead!

224
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:46,280
When I return they shall be
happy if the area of ​​Trajano

225
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:52,360
only gives them a small corner.
To be buried in...

226
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:57,559
Sabotage, strikes... agitators
trying to overthrow law and order.

227
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:04,840
There is only one thing... send
them to the camps in Germany!

228
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:13,449
Such action must be taken, but we
don't have sufficient strength here.

229
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:18,710
This is politics... your
words no longer hold.

230
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,849
- Our properties are threatened.
- Is that an ultimatum?

231
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:31,110
I was promised that my
properties would be protected.

232
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,840
The protection of private property
must exist in every regime.

233
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:43,659
We want to see action now!

234
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:47,869
That's why I moved
my brigade here...

235
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:58,269
You probably don't know my gut.
His brigade is the most powerful.

236
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,289
Of course they cost a bit,
but they do the job.

237
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:07,880
- They are here tomorrow.
- Corbari is going away...

238
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,389
...he must not be given the
chance to harm the entire population.

239
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:16,099
I order an attack
straight from the front.

240
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:23,739
In this case, it is necessary
to understand one's enemy

241
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,820
to be able to take
advantage of his shortcomings.

242
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,849
What are you thinking about?

243
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:34,380
I want to get this
done a little faster.

244
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,090
If we're going to defend ourselves...
we need to be able to do it soon.

245
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,260
The whole town needs to
realise what might happen.

246
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,440
- Tell them tomorrow.
- Don't worry.

247
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:51,699
And tell them not
to have any illusions.

248
00:43:52,179 --> 01:27:43,878
We must not worry
about the risks.

249
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:58,550
The important thing
now is to finish it.

250
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,530
Let him speak clearly..!

251
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,519
Tomorrow is a big
day for Trajano and us.

252
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,090
"The population must gather to
appoint a council to manage our zone."

253
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,739
"Corbari has handed
over command to Martino

254
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,090
"and I feel that he already
has other things on his mind."

255
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,949
Now we have direct distribution,
lower prices

256
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:50,250
to the delight of all housewives.

257
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,039
What do you want?

258
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:13,860
The people of Kadrejago need you!

259
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:19,489
We have occupied the town
and need someone to defend it!

260
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,429
- It's outside our zone!
- It's only three miles...

261
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,139
Miguel, we're leaving!

262
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,340
- There is a meeting tomorrow!
- You can start without me.

263
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,039
I might expand the zone
to include Kadrejago too!

264
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:55,840
You're leading me into a trap...
you're a spy aren't you?

265
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,840
Ridiculous...wait and see.
The whole town is waiting for you!

266
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:12,280
An ambush, huh?
Where would it take place?

267
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,369
Where?

268
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,510
- After the Magnesoli crossing.
- How many soldiers?

269
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,510
I don't know...maybe 30-40.

270
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,309
- What else do you know?
- They just told me

271
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,030
to jump off before the intersection.
Then the shooting would begin.

272
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,829
Down the street..!

273
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:55,079
I feel good...

274
00:50:20,139 --> 00:50:21,880
Are you hit?

275
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:26,880
- It is nothing.
- Quiet...

276
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:32,199
It's a splinter.

277
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:37,510
What the hell is that..?

278
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:42,969
Trajano...

279
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:59,610
"We were about a week
from Guiliano's headquarters."

280
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:05,110
"Michele and the others had
tried in vain to get him to stop."

281
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:08,829
"His condition was critical."

282
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,030
"He couldn't forgive
himself for being late."

283
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,519
What is going on?

284
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,340
- We retreat...
- You were lucky to find us.

285
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,809
Guiliano has moved
higher up in the mountains.

286
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,809
Corbari, why didn't you
tell me you were injured?

287
00:55:43,059 --> 00:55:44,739
Let me look…

288
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:10,150
It was close...

289
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,829
Cotton and alcohol..!

290
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:16,989
Relax... I'll take care of this.

291
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:23,730
Just let me rest...
You know what they did?

292
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:33,940
- I was fooled...all the people...
- It could have happened to anyone.

293
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,940
- Take it easy.
- I was tricked...

294
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:41,940
We might be able to drive
them away from Trajano...

295
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,880
Then we can discuss
what can be done.

296
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:49,260
We can't attack yet.
We must cooperate and wait.

297
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:57,849
The Allies have promised to help,
but we are not ready yet.

298
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:05,530
Are we ready for spring...

299
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:11,460
- Are you listening?
- No, I don't want to listen.

300
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:23,489
- Lay down. You have a high fever.
- I must be an idiot.

301
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:29,070
Coming here and talking to you...
it was completely pointless.

302
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:33,389
Fighting for freedom
is not revolution.

303
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:39,659
- I'm asking for your opinions...
- Shut up, or we will.

304
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,179
Shut up, he's ill!

305
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,539
- You are alone now, Corbari.
- You don't know what
you're talking about...

306
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:54,789
Cassade, tell him..!

307
00:57:56,739 --> 00:58:02,110
- Has he gone?
- I don't know...

308
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,599
- I'm here...
- Tell him.

309
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:16,340
- They were all killed.
- You and Nicole are alive!

310
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:24,760
- We can start over!
- You have to face the facts!

311
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,539
- What is he saying?
Take off the bandage,
I can't hear anything.

312
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:34,570
It's time for you to wake
up from your dream.

313
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:43,769
- I don't hear, Professor.
- Listen, for God's sake!

314
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:50,969
- Don't scream... you
don't have to scream...

315
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:05,289
Are you sleeping?

316
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:08,230
We wait another day,
so it's just sleep.

317
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:15,110
A group of partisans will
arrive here tomorrow evening.

318
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:23,440
I hope Guiliano appoints
you head of the group.

319
00:59:25,219 --> 00:59:26,070
Are you awake?

320
00:59:27,219 --> 00:59:30,070
Inez was not killed!
She is here with us...

321
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:33,489
You are not sleeping..?

322
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:36,489
You just don't want to know.

323
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:47,199
"I wanted to find a way to
show that I believed in him."

324
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:52,000
"My feelings for Trajano
had been as strong as his."

325
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:58,170
"I wanted to thank him…
but couldn't find the words."

326
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:09,639
So he has abandoned everything?
Trajano, the Republic, the followers.

327
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:12,409
It looks like that.

328
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,929
- I don't believe that.
- He's coming with us.

329
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:20,519
I don't think so.

330
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:04,510
<font color="#00f600"><b>CORBARI IS DEAD</b></font>

331
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,679
"Corbari left us yesterday
and Inez has not been seen."

332
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:39,949
"According to him I am more
dead than the friends of Trajano."

333
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:47,440
"I'm glad I'm free from
him and never met him."

334
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,750
- What are you doing in my office?
- I have news for the newspaper.

335
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:26,269
And since there is no electricity,
I turned off the light.

336
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:29,269
The way you are dressed,
I thought you were a man.

337
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,269
What news is that?

338
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:42,030
- It must be a front page headline.
- The presses are already running...

339
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:47,690
But if Hitler challenged
Mussolini to a duel,
I'll stop the presses.

340
01:04:53,019 --> 01:05:00,179
- Corbari is alive and well.
- Where is he then..?

341
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,719
Here...

342
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,719
... alive and well.

343
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,800
Now you do believe that, don't you?

344
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:13,050
Sit down...

345
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:22,050
Call the press and change
the headline to: "Corbari is alive".

346
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:35,440
Change the front page to a
nine-column... "Corbari is alive".

347
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:40,070
I'll explain later!
It is a new political thrust.

348
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:48,489
Tell me about more
space for a N.B.

349
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,500
- How many columns?
- A small one is fine.

350
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,030
Leave a column free
for the time being.

351
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,380
You probably think it's a lie,
but it was nice to meet you.

352
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:15,780
I have always admired you...
and especially your courage.

353
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:24,070
You fight for justice and salvation.

354
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:28,539
I don't need your admiration,
you scumbag!

355
01:06:29,179 --> 01:06:33,289
What do you mean?
I admire you!

356
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:42,239
I thought you were alive,
but was forced to publish it!

357
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:51,269
- I'm only following orders...
- From who? The names..?

358
01:06:52,420 --> 01:07:02,750
OK...Visciati, Orlandi...
the big landowner..!

359
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:09,400
They are the ones responsible..!

360
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,309
This speaks against you...

361
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:47,929
The headline is ready
and will soon go to press.

362
01:07:49,219 --> 01:07:50,929
And the empty space?

363
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:03,050
The unexpected...death...

364
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:06,639
...for our editor.

365
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,819
This way!

366
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,369
"Corbari is alive"...

367
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:07,869
He knows a lot of tricks.

368
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:18,630
You have to have a lot of experience
to handle a person like this.

369
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,689
How about this?

370
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:25,069
"Our editor has passed away..."

371
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:33,250
Corbari will probably try again.
It's just a matter of waiting...

372
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,319
Corbari is dead...

373
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:50,130
- Hopeless...I'm done now.
- Not as long as I believe in you.

374
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:52,250
It's no use, Inez.

375
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:59,149
Who do you see in the mirror?
It's Corbari...

376
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:06,720
Do you recognise him? A lifetime
of living Corbari, with company.

377
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:14,420
- Sorry, you didn't sign!
- I do it in the car.

378
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,780
You are welcome...

379
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,970
Try nothing!

380
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:15,720
They got rich by taking
advantage of the workers.
Then came Corbari.

381
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,600
What are you waiting for?
Cut him down!

382
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:45,800
Hurry up!

383
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:54,460
What are you staring at?

384
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,359
Wait in the car..!

385
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,140
Down there...down there!

386
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,310
A few more minutes...

387
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,529
Suddenly I heard a shot..!

388
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,079
- Did you see them?
- There were two men...I shot...

389
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:55,020
I think it's that car!

390
01:13:58,779 --> 01:14:00,180
You there..!

391
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,970
There they are!

392
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,710
They ran out into the backyard!

393
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,020
- How many were they?
- Two, I think.

394
01:14:41,939 --> 01:14:43,590
They have gone...

395
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,579
They should all be shot!
You are incompetent!

396
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:23,850
It's almost treason!
It is incomprehensible!

397
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:31,510
It's not just once he
slips away...but trice!

398
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:37,760
- Eluded capture again!
- We discovered two of his hiding places.

399
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:44,500
After they moved, yes!
Did he leave the address..?

400
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,229
He's still on the move!

401
01:15:47,539 --> 01:15:54,810
How can you let one man make
such a laughing stock of you?

402
01:15:56,699 --> 01:16:03,329
We have to apply to someone else!
Start by interrogating them!

403
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:16,720
If this continues, half the town
will probably be interrogated!

404
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:26,680
I know...he has to get out
of here. No danger, Inez.

405
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,859
Don't cry.

406
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:46,090
"I never wanted to see him again,
but the news of him got me

407
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,390
to realise that I could not
be separated from him."

408
01:16:48,699 --> 01:16:56,800
"I spoke to Guiliano and
got his permission to go."

409
01:16:59,659 --> 01:17:04,729
"He probably respected
Corbari's individuality

410
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:09,829
"and when I left,
all the others followed."

411
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,869
Come here!

412
01:17:23,859 --> 01:17:28,899
- Maybe I've overlooked something.
- They were only a few seconds ahead.

413
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:32,479
The woman opened the
door and said they had left.

414
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:39,420
- Corbari doesn't exist!
- The men who were killed, then?

415
01:17:40,579 --> 01:17:44,229
They just said it was Corbari!

416
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:49,119
You have done enough now.
We leave while we can.

417
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:56,100
No, I have to follow
through on the plans.
It's too late to back out now.

418
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:00,210
If I don't take the last one,
everyone thinks I've given up!

419
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:05,130
They shouldn't get
that satisfaction...

420
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:15,399
Bring all the women, who had
anything to do with Corbari, here.

421
01:18:15,579 --> 01:18:19,750
- In person or a photograph.
- There can't be many.

422
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:25,680
His assistant is a woman.
It is a logical conclusion.

423
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:28,750
Remember the woman
who led them astray?

424
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:36,140
- That woman..?
- Keep her under constant surveillance.

425
01:19:06,899 --> 01:19:11,520
They force everyone to
somehow pay for those killed.

426
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:14,140
I think it's nasty.

427
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:24,289
It's hard to find something to eat.
Everyone must have a ration card.

428
01:19:26,779 --> 01:19:28,340
That's all we have.

429
01:19:28,739 --> 01:19:31,020
The funeral is
tomorrow evening at 9.

430
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:36,760
It's dark then
and it fits perfectly.

431
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:45,569
Corbari and I ambushed
the first Germans here.

432
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:48,569
I'll never forget
how scared I was.

433
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:01,359
Everyone without exception
must attend the ceremony!

434
01:20:01,659 --> 01:20:06,960
I want the whole town there!

435
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:12,600
- The patrol force, then?
- The whole brigade will be present.

436
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:24,239
- All preparations are done.
- Good...

437
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:31,460
- It could be her!
- Maybe it...

438
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:36,329
The big eyes are familiar.
She's the one we're looking for.

439
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:50,529
She will lead us to Corbari.
Bring plenty of copies.

440
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:53,949
Make sure everyone
gets a photograph of her.

441
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:00,859
- There are no children playing there.
- What time is it?

442
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:08,539
Don't know...about five.
I saw the sunset.

443
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:20,500
"No problem...we'll
pick you up at dawn."

444
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:46,189
We smuggled them out this morning,
but I don't know where they went.

445
01:25:46,579 --> 01:25:51,859
They are probably in the
mountains somewhere.
- Yes, I guess so.

446
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,750
It won't be that difficult.

447
01:25:56,659 --> 01:25:58,170
Good luck...

448
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:02,800
- There are fascists everywhere!
- I know.

449
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:08,329
See you...

450
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,409
From now on, you
are a saint, Corbari.

451
01:26:53,739 --> 01:26:55,489
Now we speed up!

452
01:28:01,899 --> 01:28:05,060
- I go to the village and shop.
You are hungry, right?

453
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:09,260
Be careful, it's dangerous.

454
01:28:18,739 --> 01:28:21,340
What is it?

455
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,939
- Don't forget...
- I'll be careful.

456
01:29:19,579 --> 01:29:22,949
- We can probably build more villages now.
- Probably 10-20 pieces

457
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:26,310
but we should probably
forget the word "free zones".

458
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:31,310
- We can liberate entire regions.
- We have to expand the business.

459
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:38,810
- We have a lot to talk about.
- Right now you haven't said anything.

460
01:29:39,739 --> 01:29:45,609
Everything will go our way...
and even better.

461
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:08,729
- Did you hear any noise?
- It's just the river.

462
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,010
It's just the river…

463
01:30:26,699 --> 01:30:29,229
Now I heard something...
should I look for it?

464
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:35,800
You were right...
it's just the river.

465
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:43,800
"Corbari has changed.
The enthusiasm is still there

466
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:49,119
"but is now more controlled,
mature."

467
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:54,689
"What did he mean when
he said we should set a goal?"

468
01:30:55,539 --> 01:31:01,409
"And fight until we achieve it..."

469
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:28,140
Run!

470
01:31:32,699 --> 01:31:34,489
Keep on firing!

471
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:49,090
Help is needed here!

472
01:32:08,300 --> 03:03:56,200
Corbari...run!

473
01:33:37,539 --> 01:33:41,680
Disappear!

474
01:33:50,539 --> 01:33:52,539
Come up..!

475
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,880
Leave, you too!

476
01:34:11,659 --> 01:34:15,689
No, I'll never leave you.

477
01:34:16,659 --> 01:34:18,689
I won't leave you…
