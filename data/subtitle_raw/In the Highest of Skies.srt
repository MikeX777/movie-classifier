1
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,374
In front of you,
you can see the Colosseum.

2
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:43,421
- One of the 10 wonders of the world...
- Fausto!

3
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,907
Entirely built
thanks to foreign workforce.

4
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:52,749
In its center there's a cross,
as a statement of faith...

5
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:56,585
It's there... there...

6
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,248
is it true that the lions
used to eat the Christians in here?

7
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,157
Yes, haven't you heard
what the guide said?

8
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,764
The lions
ate 30 Christians a day.

9
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,074
At those times they were tough...

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,426
Further on you can see
the Arch of Constantine...

11
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:14,282
The "Emperor of the compromise."

12
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,137
A compromise with the Christians...

13
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:19,356
Another important monument,
also built by the slaves.

14
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,848
After all, even today they don't...

15
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,133
Well, you know...

16
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:30,116
even my mother, who is 85...

17
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,824
voted for the communists...

18
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:34,882
and make no mistake...

19
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:37,741
I didn't even have to convince her!

20
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,866
The old, glorious Catholic world...

21
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,991
of which you spoke
about at the congress...

22
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:46,491
...that world is dying, dear Fausto!

23
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:49,282
Dear Andrea,
Marxist Catholics like you or others...

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,782
are very few nowadays!

25
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:56,109
There's no one here...

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,283
Calm down... they'll come, you'll see...

27
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:01,074
They didn't even see them
at the hotel...

28
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,574
Your cappuccino is getting cold.

29
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:09,616
Why do you mix it with a spoon?
There's no sugar...

30
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,782
I take it with no sugar...

31
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,483
Can I have a couple
of cigarettes, Italo?

32
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,732
What's the point of going to visit
the Pope if the workers are not here?

33
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,974
I'll tell you what, if they don't come
I won't move from here...

34
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,824
- Who?
- The workers.

35
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:25,358
Well, listen... in our headquarters
we agreed that the workers' delegation...

36
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,449
would have joined us
at St. Angelo Castle.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,282
or even at the Vatican...

38
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:35,532
Dear Italo, don't be annoying
with your concerns about the unions!

39
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:37,900
Well, I'll be straight with you,
Mr. honorable.

40
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,282
I don't give a damn about going to see
the priests without the workers!

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,767
- Thanks again!
- You're welcome.

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,345
Let's go Toppy...

43
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,157
Listen...

44
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,491
Don't write "husband..."

45
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,699
just write "my dear Sandro..."

46
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:11,616
Honeymoon?

47
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,353
We are here for the "Holy Year..."

48
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,197
I'm sorry...

49
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:24,915
What did she say?

50
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:26,907
She told me to say that I'm sorry...

51
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,074
You see, madam...

52
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,259
these are valuable items...
you gotta be careful...

53
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:37,283
How much is it?

54
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:38,728
800.000.

55
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,540
Please pack it for me.

56
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,283
Come!

57
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:53,032
- Hello Sandro!
- What happened? What did you do?

58
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,037
What is this?

59
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,588
It's a present for my father, I liked it
a lot, you'll see, it's very nice...

60
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:58,402
Let's take a walk, should we?

61
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:01,016
I tell the taxi driver
that he can go then...

62
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:18,574
No, father...

63
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,741
I don't want
to get married with him.

64
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:24,407
He's ugly, ignorant, and...

65
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:29,616
He's right! Marry me instead!
I am good looking, rich and intelligent!

66
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:33,241
Here I am!

67
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,074
What about those balls?

68
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:48,231
The Pope had to defend himself
from the barbarians...

69
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,449
who were pretty tough...

70
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,400
Fausto is coming...

71
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,157
He's always coming at the right time...

72
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:56,184
Hello Fausto.

73
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,324
Hello, hello Eugenia...

74
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,516
Here you go,
I couldn't change these 50.000.

75
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,770
Give them to me...

76
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,074
Listen, Eugenia...
I gotta talk to you...

77
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,991
Did you understand
that Italo wants us to bring...

78
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,442
also all the workers of our hospital
to the Vatican with us?

79
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:15,817
How long have you been here for?

80
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,329
For about half an hour...

81
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:18,649
Where were they?

82
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:19,775
Listen!

83
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:22,650
- I didn't even see them...
- There's not that much to see...

84
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,559
Could you
take a picture of us please?

85
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,746
You just have to press here,
it's all set.

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,817
Thank you.

87
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:38,032
Oh, I'm sorry...
with the castle in the background!

88
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,449
Come here.

89
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,546
"How many are they in the chapel?"

90
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:47,734
"Don't ask me, but ask your lady!"

91
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,410
Please take another picture!

92
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:55,993
The folders of the group
of the Hospital "Mater Dei..."

93
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,540
Fausto Santini.

94
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,962
Journalist.

95
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,306
Don Andrea Porini.

96
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:01,822
Maura Farina.

97
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:03,177
My sister.

98
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:04,779
Welcome.

99
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,591
Sandro Tacchini, surgeon.

100
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,708
- Doctor...
- Giulio Purini.

101
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:11,583
Sister Eugenia...

102
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:13,537
Sister Teresa...

103
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:14,669
Luigi Saitti.

104
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:16,372
Head physician.

105
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,068
Adelio Cicca.

106
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,700
Dear honorable...

107
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,419
Father Carlo.

108
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:26,613
Come Italo... we didn't say hello.

109
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,082
Vera Saitta.

110
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:30,481
Good, dear. Thank you.

111
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:31,645
Bullotti Italo.

112
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:32,793
Trade unionist.

113
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:34,183
A trade unionist...

114
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:36,386
Ahh, the troubled world of labor...

115
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,949
Come with me...

116
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:48,532
Here...

117
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,977
Can the head of the delegation
please follow me?

118
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,414
The head of the delegation...

119
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:04,828
You go, Luigi.
Together with the honorable.

120
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,562
Alright.

121
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:07,718
Everybody agree?

122
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:09,163
Of course.

123
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:17,772
Tell me how it ended up
with the workers...

124
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:20,154
They didn't want to come in the end!

125
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:21,967
Let's not say this to the others...

126
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:25,962
Please...

127
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:41,681
In the speech of the Holy Father...

128
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:44,307
We could hear some kind of new tone...

129
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:48,974
...and we could also see it in the
touching and meaningful ceremony...

130
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:52,516
that we attended earlier on...

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,057
in which...

132
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:58,349
Tell me, Monsignor, how come
you have files about everyone of us?

133
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,068
It's a precaution for the safety
of His Holiness the Pope...

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,391
The silver spanner...

135
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:09,060
as a symbol of the meeting...

136
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,722
We just aired...

137
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,675
"The News."

138
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:37,245
Look how nice my present is...

139
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,400
{\an8}The story in this movie
is a fictitious one...{\an8}

140
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,282
I think it's time, Eugenia...

141
00:09:51,613 --> 00:19:43,178
{\an8}The characters, unfortunately,
are not...{\an8}

142
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,466
We're going to the Pope!

143
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:56,227
It's such a nice building...

144
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,401
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

145
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:41,795
How nice, it seems like a living room.

146
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,807
I pushed this button...

147
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:58,016
It's the right one.

148
00:11:58,157 --> 00:11:59,790
Because it says "up."

149
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:02,470
And "up" in English
means "going higher."

150
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,962
It is better if we keep the presents
in our hands...

151
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,758
it's only a couple of floors.

152
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,266
That's good... because the lift
makes me uncomfortable...

153
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,832
"Vatican cable radio."

154
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,856
Let's relax...

155
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,574
The Pope won't eat us...

156
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:24,558
In any case, it's so exciting...

157
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:28,224
"Music of our times."

158
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:30,503
Don't smoke!

159
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:34,948
I think it's forbidden anyway...
everything is so neat!

160
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,474
You see Teresa, you can smoke in here...

161
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,761
Will it be you talking
once we're in, professor?

162
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,190
- Why?
- "Catholic Action."

163
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,870
As you wish, doctor.

164
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:56,955
But it's better if the presents
will be given by Vera.

165
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:01,291
What did she say?

166
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,545
She said she agrees.

167
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,693
Did you hear Camilla?
"I think it's right!"

168
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:11,544
- It's extraordinary.
- I also understand what Camilla says!

169
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:14,169
It seems like we've made it...

170
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,255
we lost the workers along the way!

171
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,042
What do you say?

172
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:38,222
I didn't think that things
were so easy in the Vatican...

173
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,698
"Do not anxiously go after
the comfort of the body"

174
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,682
"but think of the eternal season..."

175
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:09,902
Andrea, will the women
come in a separate way,

176
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:11,896
or will we go in all together?

177
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:14,130
We'll go in all together.

178
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:17,700
"Our missions."

179
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,286
What does "floar" mean?

180
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,253
"Floar" means "flower..."

181
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:29,440
Why does it says "60 flowers"?

182
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:31,050
Where?

183
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:35,807
Well, no...

184
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,557
That is "floor..."

185
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,932
It means "level."

186
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,173
So...

187
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:48,141
"Flower" means "fiore"
and "floor" means "piano."

188
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:53,224
Well, honorable,
we can't be at the 82nd floor!

189
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,001
It's an American way
of counting the floors.

190
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:58,516
We are talking of inches here...

191
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:02,831
Inches...

192
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,909
Oh, well...

193
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:09,729
Honorable, will you be the one
reading the message to the Pope?

194
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,253
Oh, no!

195
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:13,565
Let's have a youngster reading that!

196
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:17,267
Or maybe Rosa can do that!
She knows it by heart!

197
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,725
I'm not really sure
about this inches thing...

198
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:31,279
Take a look, now it says 112.

199
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:37,759
We've been here for at least 6 minutes.

200
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:40,056
It's not 6 minutes!

201
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:42,548
It's been maybe 1 minute! 2 minutes max!

202
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:45,102
Whatever...

203
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:48,349
Let's get ready: we'll be there soon.

204
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:52,349
I think we're probably
at the level of the cupola.

205
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,688
Carlo, come here.

206
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:07,399
Come and see.

207
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,886
"Sacred music of our times..."

208
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:12,901
Who knows if there are
restaurants in here...

209
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,058
There are canteens...

210
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,315
In any case I arranged something
for the lunch...

211
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,261
"Jesus sees... and Andrea provides!"

212
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,058
Study. Study, Rosa!

213
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,446
- Do you want?
- No, thanks.

214
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,253
Oh, another one!

215
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,260
Listen, Eugenia.

216
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:55,602
Of course Luigi couldn't help
but pushing those buttons!

217
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,618
Who told him to do it?

218
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:04,470
I hope
he didn't put us in trouble.

219
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:20,599
Listen, Gullotti.
Do me a favour.

220
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,641
If you wait a moment you won't die!

221
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:26,891
You're giving me anxiety.

222
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,349
You're not telling me
that there are 333 floors, are you?

223
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:48,376
- How tall is the cupola?
- We gotta do something!

224
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:50,545
I'm so distressed.

225
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:53,435
Let's not make jokes here...

226
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:01,701
First of all...

227
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:03,553
Are we sure it's moving?

228
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:04,771
What?

229
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:09,420
- What?
- The lift. The lift of course!

230
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,514
- The lift.
- Yeah, the lift...

231
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,682
Well, according to this we should be...

232
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:24,175
...at the 473rd floor!

233
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,662
Oh, come on... enough of that...

234
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,565
Do not touch anything.

235
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,842
It's going to be embarrassing
if we make trouble...

236
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,670
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

237
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:38,428
"This is the Vatican cable radio,
broadcasting for all the listeners"

238
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:41,100
"...a program about
all the churches of the world."

239
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,334
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

240
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,516
Please do something,
cos' I don't feel well.

241
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,628
Nothing is happening...

242
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,698
Push the alarm button.

243
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,198
Uncle...

244
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:28,768
We've been in here
for more than 15 minutes now...

245
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:31,831
It's better to push the alarm button.

246
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,868
God is testing us...

247
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,259
What are you saying?

248
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:50,118
What's the meaning of this?

249
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,400
It's hard to breathe in here...

250
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:14,282
Let's not make it dramatic,
dear Italo.

251
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:17,324
It is indeed easy
to breathe in here.

252
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,116
Let's bang all together every time
the light of a new floor is on!

253
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:33,242
So that they will hear us for sure.

254
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,632
I agree.

255
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,077
It doesn't have to be all of us
doing it... only the men can do it.

256
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:42,038
Andrea.

257
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,492
No, no, no... stop it!

258
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:55,523
- Who's taking a look at the light?
- Me!

259
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,851
Take a look at the light Andrea,
it's better...

260
00:20:58,187 --> 00:21:01,241
It's better
if we all take a look at that.

261
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,957
Rosa.

262
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,379
- This is good fun!
- Now!

263
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,567
Now!

264
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,981
Harder!

265
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:41,442
Come on!

266
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:56,137
Well, let's try to be reasonable.

267
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:57,895
Let's examine the situation.

268
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,621
I think the best thing to do is to wait.

269
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,192
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

270
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:17,949
Bullotti, it's better if you put
your jacket back on.

271
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:19,442
"Good afternoon."

272
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:22,116
Otherwise you'll catch a cold
when we get out.

273
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,874
"Music from the new world."

274
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,509
Look!

275
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:41,720
The message for the Pope!

276
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,824
Hey, there is water here!

277
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:52,741
Just say that you are joking...

278
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:54,790
Where? Where?

279
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:57,509
I was joking.

280
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,884
That was a joke.

281
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,290
Vera...

282
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:07,274
made a joke.

283
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,077
Good Vera.

284
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:42,653
Well...

285
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,410
Let's make ourselves comfortable.

286
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,184
Andrea.

287
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:50,657
Let's ask around for some opinions.

288
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:53,153
No thanks, I'll stand.

289
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,387
You know what I think?

290
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,676
I feel very calm.

291
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:01,282
Let's relax
and see what we can really do.

292
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,723
Carlo.

293
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:05,105
You start.

294
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,214
I don't know...

295
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,523
I wouldn't know...

296
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,067
I'm not an expert of this...

297
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:20,866
I think it's just a common accident.

298
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:25,223
There is no issue that can't be solved.

299
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:31,067
No, Giulio, don't sit there!

300
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:34,032
The ampullas are there!
Sit on the other one.

301
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,015
They searched us.

302
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:50,032
Motherfuckers! Open it! Open it!

303
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:54,553
Open it! Open it! Open it!

304
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:59,217
The workers! The workers!

305
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:01,467
I want to go back to the workers!

306
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:04,470
Stop it Italo, calm down! We're not
going to solve anything like this...

307
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:07,400
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Italo!

308
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,567
- Do something!
- You're hurting her!

309
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:13,782
Move away! Move away!

310
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:22,259
Oh my God.

311
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:30,949
Italo...

312
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,914
Jesus... Jesus...

313
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,539
Eugenia...

314
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:37,375
Italo...

315
00:25:45,856 --> 00:25:48,574
How is he, how is he?

316
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,637
He's OK... he's OK.

317
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,239
Here, smell this.

318
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,486
Stand him up.

319
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,962
Vera, help me.

320
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:11,882
Lie down, Bullotti.

321
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,257
The pillow.

322
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,889
- Just like the lizard...
- What?

323
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,491
Just like hay that burns...

324
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:26,986
Let's hope he's not hurt too bad.

325
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,861
All this is confusing...

326
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:31,267
- The old folks fell asleep...
- What?

327
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:33,993
The numbers...

328
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:37,016
If there are bombs on the tracks...

329
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:40,415
No one is backing off...

330
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:45,223
The leaders are not coming...

331
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,051
The fascists...

332
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:49,903
Poor Italo, he's delirious...

333
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:56,132
Watch out with that glass...
you'll cut yourself.

334
00:26:56,335 --> 00:26:59,976
And it's better not to touch
anything anyway... give this to me.

335
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:04,746
The comrades...

336
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,239
Me too...

337
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:12,616
The comrades...

338
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:14,395
We are comrades...

339
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,941
We just needed this...

340
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:20,692
Look, Giulio...

341
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,085
The guns...

342
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,609
What?

343
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:25,648
The flags...

344
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,460
Maybe the lift is broken
and it keeps on going up and down.

345
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:36,218
Calm down Bullotti, be strong.

346
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,616
Well, in that case sooner or later
they will have to notice that...

347
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,140
Or maybe it's just a bad joke...

348
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:50,449
that doesn't really make me laugh...

349
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:52,817
By God! There's an injured person!

350
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,468
What does God have to do with this?

351
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,702
Who took his socks off him?

352
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:10,390
Did you try
to push the alarm button?

353
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,593
We pushed all of them.

354
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:15,143
Do you want to smoke?

355
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,699
Let's go in the corner
otherwise we'll bother everyone...

356
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:26,888
I'm sorry, can I also have a cigarette?

357
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,997
Maybe it's better
if we smoke in turns.

358
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:38,242
Uncle, I can't stand this anymore...

359
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:43,390
Vera, I told you already to be patient...
can't you see that I'm talking?

360
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,082
- You can talk to me, dear...
- Well, never mind.

361
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,879
"If you were born poor, after you die
you will be treated as a rich."

362
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:55,285
"If you were born rich,
you will be treated as poor..."

363
00:28:55,387 --> 00:28:57,574
"A concept by Saint Barnaba."

364
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:10,900
We need something bigger...

365
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,317
Vera

366
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:15,574
take my present.

367
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:21,199
- Italo is dead.
- Jesus, how can that be?

368
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:22,733
We also have the paper cutter...

369
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:26,949
It's better with the cutlery...
gold is more resistant!

370
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,668
Did he die?

371
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,981
Just like on the trains...
are you scared?

372
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:33,567
No, please shut up.

373
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,741
I'll help you with that...

374
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:39,840
Leave it to me, dear...

375
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,199
Are you really sure?

376
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:51,126
Poor Italo.

377
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:53,759
Dead?!

378
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,986
Come on!

379
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:13,232
The trade unionist
is not feeling well...

380
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,157
Harder!

381
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,650
Come on!

382
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,540
Italo is not breathing.

383
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,478
He seems dead.

384
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,086
All together!

385
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:33,922
Now!

386
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,531
Damn!

387
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:39,172
- Did you cut yourself?
- Maybe it's the buttons!

388
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:45,299
What are you doing?! Are you crazy?

389
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:50,507
You'll break everything that way...

390
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:52,756
Give this to me.

391
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:10,299
If we manage to get to the cables,
we solve it.

392
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:23,549
- What we need is some paper...
- A piece of fabric?

393
00:31:37,224 --> 00:31:40,420
We are trying to repair the lift.

394
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:49,298
So?

395
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:54,712
Honorable.

396
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:58,191
I don't know if that will be enough
as insulator.

397
00:31:58,242 --> 00:31:59,946
Let's try...

398
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,414
There's no light!

399
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,320
Stop it!

400
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,711
You dumb idiots, can't you see
that there's no light now?

401
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:17,131
Mama! Mama!

402
00:32:17,912 --> 00:32:19,372
So?

403
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:27,645
Well, the light went off though...

404
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:31,903
Yes it did...

405
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:35,488
They got to the contacts...

406
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,777
Leave it, Vera. You'll cut yourself.

407
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:42,274
They'll come off
when they open the door.

408
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:47,854
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

409
00:32:56,942 --> 00:33:00,152
Do something, Sandro.
I'm having enough of this.

410
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:03,527
Well, don't tell me...

411
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,598
What about them?

412
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,215
Let them pray...

413
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:12,066
Let's go and talk to the honorable.

414
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,843
Think about our son!

415
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:35,696
I have to pee.

416
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,353
Vera, why don't you come here and pray?

417
00:33:42,196 --> 00:33:44,657
You also, Giulio, it wouldn't hurt you
to pray, you know?

418
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:47,732
I don't believe
neither in saints nor Epiphany!

419
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,445
Why should I pray?

420
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,860
I really have to pee...!

421
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,290
You lout!

422
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:13,532
Well done!

423
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:16,548
- Shut up, you idiot!
- How dare you!

424
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:19,657
How dare you, you piece of shit!

425
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:22,977
Look here!

426
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:24,336
Giulio!

427
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,358
Giulio, Giulio!

428
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,748
Calm down.

429
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:39,184
Calm down, Giulio, leave it.

430
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:41,684
Let's try to be reasonable.

431
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:44,231
They can't take such things.

432
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:47,941
- They're old fashioned...
- Listen to those communists!

433
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:54,170
You're really educating them well,
these youngsters...

434
00:34:57,608 --> 00:35:00,899
They learn bad behaviour in school...

435
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:10,129
Through this holy unction...

436
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,902
and His mercy...

437
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,874
may the Lord help you...

438
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,332
in the grace of the holy spirit...

439
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:24,653
Amen.

440
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,124
May He grant you indulgence
for your sins and save you...

441
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:31,291
and may His love lift you...

442
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,746
Amen.

443
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:48,416
Brothers, let's play for our brother
Italo and let's say all together:

444
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:51,792
"Hear our prayer, Lord."

445
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,958
"Hear our prayer, Lord."

446
00:35:55,417 --> 00:36:01,041
May the Lord visit this infirm, and
comfort him through the holy unction.

447
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,682
Let's pray.

448
00:36:02,776 --> 00:36:05,455
"Hear our prayer, Lord."

449
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,957
May He, thanks to His power,
keep him from evil...

450
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,791
"Hear our prayer, Lord."

451
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:15,825
Leave it, Maura.

452
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,533
We'll lose our balance.

453
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,749
May His grace comfort
all the sick ones, let's pray...

454
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:23,825
Honorable.

455
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:27,541
I can't help but thinking
that someone is spying on us...

456
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:29,426
Godless!

457
00:36:29,973 --> 00:36:32,416
Stop it! Let them work!

458
00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:37,699
You communists are very pragmatic...
when it's for your own good!

459
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,715
"Communists"? How dare you?

460
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:43,622
Teresa, do you enjoy
being trapped in here?

461
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:47,981
Did you find anything?

462
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,723
Everything seems to be welded.

463
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,551
...or it might even be
one single piece...

464
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:59,895
in any case, touching the ceiling
I could hear the vibrations...

465
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:01,867
Excuse me, Eugenia...

466
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,390
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

467
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:08,124
"Pilgrims rosary..."

468
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,390
- Do you want a piece?
- No, thanks.

469
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:32,101
I really can't stand
salami without bread...

470
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:43,957
Look, this is sticking out!

471
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:48,624
We have to lift it,
maybe we could find a way out...

472
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,583
Sandro, make them move those packets.

473
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,434
Vera, move to the other side...

474
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:39,057
Well, at least we found something.

475
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:23,170
Eugenia...

476
00:39:24,771 --> 00:39:26,943
Take a bit of this.

477
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,159
Bad smell?

478
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:45,124
Take off your veil... you're sweating...

479
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:47,799
I can't. It's forbidden.

480
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:06,506
I'm sorry, Eugenia.

481
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:34,209
I'd really like to know
who's gonna pay for all these damages...

482
00:40:35,592 --> 00:40:38,132
They're breaking everything.

483
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,524
What can you see?

484
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,566
Nothing.

485
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:50,896
It's all dark.

486
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:54,076
Well...

487
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:57,756
if it's dark,

488
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,920
it means that the night came...

489
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,381
There's air coming in...

490
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:20,795
There's some kind of whirlpool.

491
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:25,108
So...

492
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:30,649
I was telling you... a movie
can be aesthetically magnificent

493
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:32,808
but if it doesn't have
the moral requisites...

494
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,811
our duty is to advise against it...

495
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:38,725
- What do you mean?
- Well, out of many movies

496
00:41:38,775 --> 00:41:41,142
that I had to see last year
because of my job as a critic.

497
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:44,649
Only about 20
were really advisable for families...

498
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:46,348
Who knows...

499
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:50,524
I probably read your articles many times
without knowing it was you...

500
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:54,707
How do we relate
to the workers nowadays?

501
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:00,225
Do we tell them the story
of the communists eating the children?

502
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:02,368
For example I think that...

503
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:07,191
Today... Marxism is changing...

504
00:42:07,582 --> 00:42:09,262
And what about the violence?

505
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:14,660
We have to try
to stick together for now.

506
00:42:14,754 --> 00:42:16,660
Andrea is Marxist...

507
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:19,058
but he is also a Christian.

508
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:23,857
Well, a Marxist dressed up as a lamb...

509
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:29,152
They're being ironic about us...

510
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:34,816
What a barbaric act...

511
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:40,524
Well...

512
00:42:41,168 --> 00:42:44,777
If we're not careful, they'll let us
come out of here with no presents...

513
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,316
My present won't be touched by anyone...

514
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:03,473
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

515
00:43:10,082 --> 00:43:13,988
"If you have no home,
the Bible will be your home."

516
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:18,215
"If you have no bread,
the Bible will be your bread."

517
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,626
"If you have no job,
faith will comfort you."

518
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:52,607
What is it? Are we there?

519
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:54,908
Stop it! Stop it!

520
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:58,516
In the name of God and
the Church, I exorcise you!

521
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:00,274
He's possessed! He's possessed!

522
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:02,357
Leave this body!

523
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:04,607
Carlo, come on!

524
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:18,311
Oh my God...

525
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:38,342
He's gone crazy.

526
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:40,311
Poor Carlo.

527
00:50:43,068 --> 00:50:46,066
I had been
looking at him for a while...

528
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:48,708
You son of a gun!

529
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,689
Pig! Pig!

530
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,618
You want this?

531
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:01,892
Take it!

532
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:14,178
I'm sorry Carlo...

533
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,240
You'll see... it's better this way...

534
00:51:17,692 --> 00:51:19,928
It doesn't matter...

535
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:24,141
While the men work...

536
00:51:24,412 --> 00:51:26,566
Let's try to gather what's left...

537
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,272
Rosa.

538
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,985
Adelio, please... leave it...

539
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,462
Let's eat first, should we?

540
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,573
You could also turn, you know...

541
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,976
Stop it with that thing!

542
00:52:55,942 --> 00:52:57,882
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

543
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:23,936
Stop smoking those cigarettes,
they're awful!

544
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:27,881
Maybe... but it's better than nothing...

545
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:31,286
Andrea, why are you Marxist?

546
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:37,786
Well...

547
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:42,184
I've read a lot...

548
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,816
Listen, Andrea...

549
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:47,683
let's be straight...

550
00:53:48,082 --> 00:53:49,980
I observed you a lot...

551
00:53:50,824 --> 00:53:52,558
If you get me out of here...

552
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,561
I'll make you rich, in maximum 2 years!

553
00:53:57,522 --> 00:54:00,566
You know that my father
is rich and demented.

554
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:05,020
Fausto, my friend... please...
why don't you rest a while?

555
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,308
Well, my dear...

556
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:09,850
maybe you can trick the others,
but I won't buy it!

557
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,431
You got it?

558
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,212
You got it?

559
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,816
Leave me alone, you idiot...
take a rest.

560
00:54:26,483 --> 00:54:27,942
Listen...

561
00:54:29,152 --> 00:54:32,925
In a while we won't be able
to think straight anymore.

562
00:54:34,683 --> 00:54:36,995
There's no food anymore...

563
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:47,857
Jesus Christ, while establishing
the communion of the flesh said...

564
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:52,107
"Take this, all of you,
and eat it... this is my body."

565
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:22,712
This...

566
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,399
Honorable...

567
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:28,204
Eating did me some good...

568
00:55:44,176 --> 00:55:45,899
What are you writing?

569
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,746
This is Fausto's.

570
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:50,027
He's writing
everything that's happening.

571
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,816
Give this to me!

572
00:55:53,902 --> 00:55:55,332
How dare you?

573
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:58,274
- It was on the floor!
- So what?

574
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:02,524
Why did you write
that we'll all end up like Hitler?

575
00:56:03,065 --> 00:56:04,800
It's a novel...

576
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,565
Asshole!

577
00:56:07,442 --> 00:56:10,871
He's thinking about novels, this one...

578
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:14,043
Leave it...

579
00:56:14,574 --> 00:56:16,020
It's dry.

580
00:56:16,983 --> 00:56:18,756
It's useless.

581
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:23,029
Leave it...

582
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,824
I heard a noise!

583
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:40,272
Like some kind of voices...

584
00:56:50,858 --> 00:56:52,248
No, no...

585
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:54,942
It was coming from here...

586
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:56,975
Thank goodness!

587
00:56:58,389 --> 00:57:00,709
They had to hear us
sooner or later!

588
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:06,899
We are happy,
because they noticed that we are here!

589
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,720
What an adventure, damn!

590
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:16,064
What a mess that we did!

591
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:25,123
What are we doing with Italo?

592
00:57:26,483 --> 00:57:28,131
What are we going to say?

593
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:34,068
Was Italo's name on the list?

594
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:41,228
There was, but then again...
there wasn't.

595
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:49,645
There was only written
"trade unionist."

596
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:53,785
Rosa.

597
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:57,483
Where is my veil?

598
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:01,607
Oh... help!

599
00:58:01,817 --> 00:58:03,796
Help!

600
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:06,691
Help!

601
00:58:10,442 --> 00:58:13,149
Help!

602
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,482
Help! Help!

603
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:20,441
Help!

604
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,129
Help!

605
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:25,692
Help!

606
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,546
Help!

607
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:29,524
Help!

608
00:58:29,608 --> 00:58:31,639
Help!

609
00:58:52,842 --> 00:58:55,404
Maybe I was wrong...

610
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:18,326
There's no hope...

611
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:30,645
This isn't fair...

612
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:54,157
You bastards.

613
00:59:54,454 --> 00:59:56,548
I don't wanna die!

614
00:59:57,733 --> 00:59:59,860
Keep an eye on Sandro...

615
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:12,881
I have to put this back, I'm sorry...

616
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:18,092
I'm not crazy...

617
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:28,220
I'm not crazy!

618
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,470
I know...

619
01:00:35,306 --> 01:00:37,048
Let's take a decision
all together...

620
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:58,410
We're all aware that he's crazy...

621
01:01:00,817 --> 01:01:02,246
It's terrible...

622
01:01:15,858 --> 01:01:17,279
Yeah, I'm in.

623
01:01:20,025 --> 01:01:23,774
We have to survive...
not for ourselves but for our faith...

624
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:26,795
Let's be realist.

625
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,131
Giulio.

626
01:01:30,942 --> 01:01:32,895
Mind your own business!

627
01:01:40,152 --> 01:01:42,675
You can vote as much as you want...

628
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:46,402
This is murder.

629
01:01:48,983 --> 01:01:50,631
7 are in favour...

630
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:55,342
Are you dealing with it, Andrea?

631
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:20,982
What's the matter, Luigi? What's wrong?

632
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,996
I feel unwell.

633
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,418
I feel unwell...

634
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,051
Really, really...

635
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,785
Leave Carlo alone.

636
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:36,902
Take me instead.

637
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,269
I'm about to die.

638
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,347
The Lord will forgive you.

639
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:49,433
The uncle is sick!

640
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,899
Just like the time
when he had the heart problem.

641
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:56,745
Shut up you little tart...

642
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:59,526
Bitch! Bitches!

643
01:03:00,518 --> 01:03:02,697
You're all bitches!

644
01:03:04,776 --> 01:03:06,861
Let's moisten his lips.

645
01:03:11,647 --> 01:03:13,959
Oh yeah... with what?

646
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:20,201
You are the bitch of the bitches!

647
01:03:23,668 --> 01:03:24,934
Bitch!

648
01:03:25,707 --> 01:03:26,910
Me?

649
01:03:27,277 --> 01:03:28,535
Me?

650
01:03:28,863 --> 01:03:31,464
What do I have to do with it?

651
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,001
You have hell between your legs!

652
01:03:39,454 --> 01:03:41,634
Bitch!

653
01:04:06,017 --> 01:04:07,228
Andrea...

654
01:04:07,947 --> 01:04:10,462
look at what he had
in his underpants...

655
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:14,899
We'll give them to the poor...

656
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:23,242
That was
a close shave, dear Carlo...

657
01:04:55,165 --> 01:04:58,564
"Do not anxiously go after
the comfort of the body"

658
01:04:58,939 --> 01:05:01,907
"but think of the eternal season..."

659
01:05:09,981 --> 01:05:11,848
Let me do it...

660
01:05:18,676 --> 01:05:21,559
The numbers...

661
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,233
The numbers... the numbers... move away!

662
01:05:25,283 --> 01:05:27,192
The numbers! The numbers!

663
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:30,400
We gotta stop the numbers...

664
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:31,983
We gotta stop them!

665
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:34,067
The numbers! We gotta stop them!

666
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:36,460
Leave it! Leave it!

667
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:44,868
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

668
01:05:59,575 --> 01:06:01,707
We gotta make sure we're ready...

669
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:08,808
Look at him.

670
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,590
He's reading... reading his Bible...

671
01:06:15,981 --> 01:06:18,075
The matter is clear...

672
01:06:19,028 --> 01:06:22,246
We just need to know
who will be the next one...

673
01:06:24,617 --> 01:06:26,609
You got it, finally!

674
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:32,531
"Vatican cable radio."

675
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:35,420
Let's free the priest...

676
01:06:40,242 --> 01:06:42,124
It's all written...

677
01:06:44,054 --> 01:06:46,234
There's no stopping all this...

678
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:54,704
This time it's going to be me.

679
01:06:56,608 --> 01:06:59,732
It's either us or him...

680
01:07:01,275 --> 01:07:04,441
Let's wait until the others are asleep.

681
01:07:05,775 --> 01:07:07,618
Don't you worry...

682
01:07:11,251 --> 01:07:13,087
Fausto...

683
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:51,299
Sandro, what are you doing?

684
01:07:53,245 --> 01:07:54,901
Nothing.

685
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,799
Just sleep.

686
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,159
Is Maura sleeping?

687
01:08:01,057 --> 01:08:02,916
Yeah, she is indeed...

688
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:05,377
You should also sleep...

689
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:12,687
I was thinking about the uncle...

690
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:15,578
Who knows where he is now?

691
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:18,781
Sleep.

692
01:08:19,187 --> 01:08:21,421
He's in everyone of us...

693
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:25,718
Are you afraid?

694
01:08:30,742 --> 01:08:32,582
...finding the door...

695
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:35,442
I gotta find the door...

696
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:38,707
the closet, the table... the chairs...

697
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,833
I gotta put the chairs there...

698
01:08:41,122 --> 01:08:43,028
They don't have to let him in...

699
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:45,879
Domenico!

700
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,554
I was wishing...

701
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,828
I am like...

702
01:08:58,076 --> 01:08:59,654
What do you want to do?

703
01:09:01,692 --> 01:09:03,061
What do you know about all this?

704
01:09:03,897 --> 01:09:06,366
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you.

705
01:09:06,634 --> 01:09:08,986
Leave it, you idiot, just sleep...

706
01:09:09,329 --> 01:09:10,454
I kill you!

707
01:09:12,658 --> 01:09:15,408
Ahh! What is it? Oh God...

708
01:09:15,513 --> 01:09:17,666
It's painful... it's painful...

709
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:19,757
What is it? What is it?

710
01:09:22,234 --> 01:09:25,991
It's so painful! Oh God, it's painful...

711
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,663
What is it?

712
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:47,874
Do not touch her.

713
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:50,640
She could lose a lot of blood...

714
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,379
Here he is... the Marxist!

715
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:13,343
Shitty Communist!

716
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,242
It was you killing her, assassin!

717
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,098
No, you are the assassin!

718
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:56,074
What is all this?

719
01:11:09,528 --> 01:11:11,559
He doesn't want to talk, the bastard!

720
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:14,582
Talk!

721
01:11:37,398 --> 01:11:39,531
Give me the lighter, Maura.

722
01:11:39,984 --> 01:11:41,827
I'll make his memory warm.

723
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,601
Well, I've had enough...

724
01:12:07,226 --> 01:12:09,070
He doesn't know anything...

725
01:12:17,325 --> 01:12:19,106
I'm thirsty...

726
01:12:36,575 --> 01:12:38,684
I've done it for you too...

727
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:40,856
you idiots!

728
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:16,421
I'm thirsty...

729
01:13:30,867 --> 01:13:33,210
"Praised be Jesus Christ."

730
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:42,867
Have mercy on us.

731
01:14:40,658 --> 01:14:42,197
Once again...

732
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,379
Once again!

733
01:14:58,939 --> 01:15:01,150
I would have done that...

734
01:15:14,031 --> 01:15:16,093
He was sleeping!

735
01:15:19,851 --> 01:15:21,742
He was sleeping...

736
01:15:25,535 --> 01:15:27,450
Sandro!

737
01:15:28,559 --> 01:15:31,824
He was sleeping!

738
01:15:32,117 --> 01:15:35,241
My face. My face!

739
01:16:08,749 --> 01:16:10,343
Adelio!

740
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:49,290
"Be honest with your family..."

741
01:16:49,368 --> 01:16:51,634
"Submissive at work..."

742
01:16:51,867 --> 01:16:54,367
"Easygoing with authorities..."

743
01:16:54,471 --> 01:16:56,971
"A concept by Saint Fulgenzio."

744
01:18:15,242 --> 01:18:16,718
It's good.

745
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,223
Eat it.

746
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:53,157
You will never eat me...

747
01:18:55,054 --> 01:18:56,374
Will you?

748
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:03,656
Sleep.

749
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:15,866
- Come here, Fausto, come.
- "Praised be Jesus Christ."

750
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,547
"This is the Vatican cable radio,
broadcasting for all the listeners"

751
01:20:19,598 --> 01:20:22,543
"...a program about
all the churches of the world."

752
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:27,695
Is it painful...

753
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:32,952
...to die of starvation?

754
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:36,973
I don't know.

755
01:20:40,864 --> 01:20:42,871
I know that you...

756
01:20:44,109 --> 01:20:46,109
...will help me...

757
01:21:11,704 --> 01:21:14,243
I finally got it, you know?

758
01:21:21,158 --> 01:21:23,158
What?

759
01:21:32,156 --> 01:21:33,952
Thank you my Lord...

760
01:21:41,908 --> 01:21:45,032
He will make us all saints...!

761
01:21:48,009 --> 01:21:52,173
You bastard... don't you see she's dead?

762
01:24:15,242 --> 01:24:19,949
"If you will be a good Christian,
you won't surrender to compromises..."

763

by other ideals..."

765
01:25:17,325 --> 01:25:18,918
No!

766
01:25:21,492 --> 01:25:23,051
Camilla no!

767
01:25:50,117 --> 01:25:51,640
No!

768

Somebody help me.

You idiot...

784
01:28:58,715 --> 01:29:00,965
...get out...

785
01:29:01,778 --> 01:29:05,791
I want to get out...

Sister Teresa.

787
01:30:04,342 --> 01:30:05,816
Your Eminence.

788
01:30:05,887 --> 01:30:07,774
This is a great day for us...

789
01:30:07,825 --> 01:30:10,395
A great day of a great year!
