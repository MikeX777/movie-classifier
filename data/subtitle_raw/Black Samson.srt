1
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:13,805
Hey, let me tell you, man,
she taste like watermelons.

2
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:16,912
Watermelons?
Okay, grapefruit.

3
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:21,539
Hey, don't touch the jacket, man.
Didn't I tell you not to touch the jacket?

4
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:24,186
That's $400, eh? Four hundred dollars.

5
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:27,414
Bitch, you killer blind and Scrooge.

6
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,950
So that's him, the big man.

7
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:36,127
Look, it's wearing a dress. Ha, ha.

8
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,233
Yeah, he's really a sweetie.

9
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:41,493
How you doing, mama? Looking fine.

10
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:43,400
Look at that.

11
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,268
That's his bitch.

12
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,000
Not bad.

13
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:49,974
Definitely prime cut.

14
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,774
Harry, you wouldn't know
what to do with that if you had it.

15
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,281
What will it be?

16
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,151
Beer.

17
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,690
If you have any clean glasses.

18
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:05,922
How about you?

19
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,394
- I would like Scotch on the rocks, please.
- You got it.

20
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:11,590
Thank you.

21
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,929
Hey.
Hey, babe.

22
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,333
I like that one even better.

23
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,565
Does she remind you of your old lady?

24
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:22,802
Yeah, a little, in the hips. Ha, ha.

25
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,311
How much she cost for the night?

26
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,078
More than you can pay in a year.

27
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:31,743
I got a credit card.

28
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:35,687
Harry, that's for gas, not for ass.

29
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:48,593
- All right, 50 bucks, is that fair?
- Ha-ha-ha!

30
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:57,808
Fifty bucks, honey. Are you worth it?

31
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:00,643
Your pimp boss doesn't seem to think so.

32
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,517
Tell your friend to cool it.

33
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,550
I don't own him.

34
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:09,082
Why don't you relax, friend?

35
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:11,658
That's what I'm trying to do.

36
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:16,859
Harry, you be careful of this guy,
because he's really tough.

37
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,364
Yeah.

38
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,526
Probably real tough
with some limp drunk.

39
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,399
Just want things to be cool.

40
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,438
Listen, I want a piece of that up there.

41
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:28,304
If I have to,
I'll take a piece of you with it.

42
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,677
- It's your move.
- Hah!

43
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,655
Look out, look out, look out.

44
00:05:53,836 --> 00:05:55,770
Oh, no. This kid can fuck you up.

45
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,200
That man been Samsonized.

46
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,581
Here it come. Here it come.

47
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:17,018
No deal.

48
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:23,964
I just can't take him anywhere.
He... He's a menace.

49
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,896
Not anymore.

50
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,266
No, he certainly isn't.

51
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,675
Just keep your people out of here.

52
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,644
What...? Well, you run a bar here.
You have a license.

53
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,873
You have to serve anybody
comes in here, don't you?

54
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,017
Yeah, but they may not get
what they order.

55
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:45,211
This is a lousy bar with lousy service.

56
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,148
I'll sure buy that.

57
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,456
Samson, I'll see you later.

58
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,254
Nappa.

59
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,998
Take your garbage with you.
I'd hate for you to get fined for littering.

60
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,700
Okay.

61
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,338
That's right.
Eat your feet, white boy. Get out.

62
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,339
- Bye.
Fuck him.

63
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:08,168
Right on out the door.

64
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,939
Willie. All right,
let's play some groovy music.

65
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,588
Oh, that's beautiful, baby.

66
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,495
Oh, you're really beautiful, man.

67
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:33,868
You really done great.

68
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,003
Hey.

69
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,868
He almost broke his stick on your head.

70
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,780
Look, Harry, you take this.

71
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,545
You take this and you get a cab
and you get out of here.

72
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,456
Get out of here really quick...

73
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:58,151
...because this neighborhood
can close down on you.

74
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,588
Okay, man?

75
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,193
Hmm?

76
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,428
Hoodoo.

77
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,070
He's getting faster.

78
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,829
Okay, that's enough, brute.

79
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,167
How you doing, Henry?
What you holding, man?

80
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:14,241
I'm ready to boogie.

81
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,208
Broke it up.

82
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:24,084
Broke it up.

83
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,758
That's okay, Henry,
we'll clean it up in the morning.

84
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,953
It's a damn shame, Mr. Samson.
That was a good table.

85
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,360
- Baby, let's go, I'm really tired.
- Okay.

86
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:42,402
Well, I-I gotta be finding myself
a place to flop, uh...

87
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:46,941
- I'm getting too old for this night life.
- You can stay here.

88
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,537
- Couldn't do that.
- Sure you can.

89
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,910
There's some food back there.
You can make yourself something to eat.

90
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:58,816
- There's even a little bed.
- I appreciate the food and the bed.

91
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,319
Then you're on.

92
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,790
You sure that lion don't eat at night?

93
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:09,461
No, Henry. He may roar a little bit,
but that's about it.

94
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,897
Oh, I ain't scared of him. No, sir.

95
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:16,129
You just get yourself some sleep,
and you can be my night watchman.

96
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,034
That's the ticket, Mr. Samson.

97
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:22,644
I always like to pay my own way,
so to speak.

98
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,474
Okay. Come on, baby.

99
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,343
Mr. Samson.

100
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,541
You are a righteous man.

101
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,812
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.

102
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,597
Now, listen here, lion.

103
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,532
I don't want no shit out of you,
understand?

104
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,932
I hope you understand.

105
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:54,133
Because I'm from
an African background too.

106
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,507
And we know how to handle cats like you.
Catch on?

107
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:02,282
Oh! Goddamn it. Don't do that.

108
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,510
Don't you do that.

109
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,155
Should have left you in Africa.

110
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:13,727
And me in Peoria.

111
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,446
Good morning, darling.

112
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:34,947
Good morning to you, baby.

113
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:39,651
Where are you going so early?

114
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,887
I'm going to see the old man.

115
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,359
You're gonna leave me for an old man?

116
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,491
That's right.

117
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,895
Can't you stay just a little while longer?

118
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:58,137
Baby.

119
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,933
Baby, you are starting to bug me.

120
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:11,443
Johnny.

121
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:14,288
I'll miss you.

122
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,587
Shut up and get my coat.

123
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,814
You look terrific.

124
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,713
I'm serious.

125
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,048
See you later.

126
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:48,520
Hey.

127
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,423
What am I supposed to do?

128
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:59,634
Well, get out your crayons
and work on your coloring book.

129
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:04,229
Come on.

130
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,171
- Straighten up, here come the main man.
- The main, main man.

131
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:09,470
- I'm clean.
- Good thing we're all cool.

132
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,545
- Samson himself.
- How's it going, Deadly?

133
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,272
Right on, straight as your stick.

134
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,441
- Come to the club and I'll buy you a drink.
- I'll do that.

135
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,643
- Right on.
- Right on.

136
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,152
- Got a smoke?
- Yeah. There goes a righteous dude.

137
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,517
He keeps the honky motherfuckers
off the street.

138
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,591
- For how long?
- I wouldn't fuck with him.

139
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,695
No, sir.
He comes down with all the weight.

140
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,695
Then you start hitting
on a 13-year-old kid.

141
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,934
Putting the stuff on him.

142
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,472
Who sent you there?

143
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:42,167
I don't know.

144
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,574
What are you doing, man?

145
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,238
Messing with our people, killing them.

146
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,976
Just to keep your ass in gear.

147
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,112
Huh?

148
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:58,321
You ain't gonna tell the cops, are you?
They'll throw the key away.

149
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,686
That could been your head.

150
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,924
You wouldn't have been able to crawl
to a connection.

151
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:13,942
I'm gonna try to help you.

152
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,978
No cops.

153
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,740
But you gotta try
to get it together yourself.

154
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,592
That's Samson's turf, right there.
That fat piece.

155
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,695
Right in the middle of everything.

156
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:38,191
That reminds me
of one of those little countries...

157
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,200
...like Liechtenstein or Monte Carlo.

158
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,201
Neutral, untouched.

159
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:44,396
It's untouched.

160
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,269
Lots of profits in an area like that.

161
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,501
Yes, sir.

162
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:50,110
But it's not only that.

163
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,113
It's like a symbol, a special place.

164
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:57,275
Not good public relations.

165
00:13:57,453 --> 00:14:01,321
Well, the word is, uncle,
that Arthur and his niggers, uh...

166
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,219
...will be moving in there very soon.

167
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:06,156
That would be very bad for our business.

168
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,387
Very bad, stupid.

169
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:12,300
Yes, sir, that's what I mean.
All I need is your permission.

170
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:16,097
I don't like rough stuff.
It doesn't pay anymore.

171
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:18,062
You are a good boy, Giovanni.

172
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,041
The longer he keeps the area clean, uncle,
the harder it is going to be for us.

173
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:25,976
We must move gently...

174
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:30,778
...explore, offer, reason together.

175
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,682
Yes, sir.

176
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:35,380
But Samson is not that type.

177
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,583
Don't look for trouble.

178
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,886
Be patient.

179
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:43,157
Bribe here, move a little there.

180
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:46,631
But intelligent, you understand?

181
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,566
Intelligent.

182
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:51,137
Yes, sir.

183
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:52,766
Intelligent.

184
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,014
Now, I don't want you to worry
about a thing.

185
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:13,525
Our motto has always been,
as it was with my dear departed father...

186
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,163
God rest his soul.

187
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:20,394
- that the family shall not be troubled
at this most unfortunate time.

188
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,503
This is my business card.

189
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,837
On the back I have written
my home telephone number.

190
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:35,348
Now, should you need me for anything,
anything, don't hesitate to call me.

191
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:39,682
Bless you, Mr. Haven.

192
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,413
Bless you.

193
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,552
C.T., would you escort the lady
to her car?

194
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,494
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

195
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,910
Oh, nigger, what you laughing at?

196
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,482
"My dear departed father."

197
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:09,845
Shit.

198
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,477
- Whoo. What are you doing?
- How y'all been?

199
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,385
I'm fine.

200
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,683
How's business?

201
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,384
Oh, people keep dying,
just like a bad habit.

202
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,621
- Oh, I mean the other business.
- Oh, that one.

203
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:23,822
Mm-hm.

204
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,433
Now, that one,
that one's doing just fine, you understand.

205
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,129
I mean, that one just kind of sits in there
and cruises like the Hydra-Matic, baby.

206
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,838
It's better than ever.

207
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:36,603
I mean, look,
I can hardly keep up with the demand.

208
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,373
Word's out that you got people
on my street.

209
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:40,913
No, sir.

210
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,881
What's the matter,
somebody hustling you around?

211
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:49,491
Somebody pushing,
somebody hustling smack.

212
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:52,218
Well, he's not one of mine.

213
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:56,888
But maybe them white boys
is nibbling at you.

214
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,163
Maybe.

215
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:03,737
Yeah, well, there's rumors like that
floating around, ain't it, C. T?

216
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,805
So you know what old Arthur gonna do?

217
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:10,137
Get high.

218
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,471
I'm gonna stay cool.

219
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,674
Just gonna stand by the sidewalk and...

220
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:20,517
...watch it all go down. Ha, ha.

221
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,056
Just so long as you stay
on your sidewalk.

222
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,195
You know, we both grew up
in the same neighborhood.

223
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:36,803
And we both know exactly how it runs.

224
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,772
So now I'm gonna tell you
a little piece of advice.

225
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:43,912
Sooner or later, those white boys
are gonna move in here.

226
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,573
I can see that. So you had better get ready
to hold on to what you've got.

227
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:53,012
You on one side and them on the other.

228
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:56,015
Where are you at?

229
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,920
I stay out as long as they stay out.

230
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,459
When they make their move
and the war comes down...

231
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,494
...well, then I'm picking up the pieces.

232
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,222
Business is business.

233
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,765
Witness to the fact.

234
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,529
What about our people?

235
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:14,670
What about our people?

236
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,607
With me,
it's the law of supply and demand.

237
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,305
And with you...
You let me tell you something.

238
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,576
When Joseph Nappa brings his boys down
into this neighborhood...

239
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:27,279
...you are gonna be the only people
on that street.

240
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,963
That's where you're wrong...

241
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,227
...brother.

242
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,176
Ah, these dance-hall girls,
they come and they go.

243
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:54,542
They are a dime a dozen.

244
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,741
What are you looking for?

245
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,282
Just looking around.

246
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,788
Well, Samson's not here.

247
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,153
Oh.

248
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:07,386
He's got the easy life, huh?

249
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,394
Sleeping late.

250
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:16,736
But you, you're, um...
You're a hard worker, aren't you?

251
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,497
Not very.

252
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,711
You gotta be crazy
to try this in a nigger neighborhood.

253
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,014
The streets are almost empty.

254
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:33,677
And that alley, even emptier.

255
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:44,419
Know what you need?

256
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,089
You need yourself a big house.

257
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:51,732
Big house with people waiting on you.

258
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,596
Bringing you breakfast in bed, baby.
And flowers...

259
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,295
All right. What is it that you want?

260
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,241
Could I get a beer?

261
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,207
We just closed.

262
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:08,076
Shucks, just my luck.

263
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:12,251
Say, I'd like to tell you something.

264
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,258
You know your boyfriend, Samson?

265
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,117
Well, he doesn't like me.

266
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:25,232
Ha, ha. And I gotta admit,
I don't really love him either.

267
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:30,662
But he has got himself
in some bad trouble.

268
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,607
Ah.

269
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:56,392
I didn't know I could still do that.

270
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,594
Come here.

271
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,237
Come here, baby.

272
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,430
You're hurting me.
- Come here.

273
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:29,689
- Stop it.
- You don't touch me.

274
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,765
Get out of the way.

275
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,810
Well, I don't really understand. I, heh.

276
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,947
I come in here to give you some advice.

277
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:50,175
When I want a pinball machine
or a jukebox, I'll come to you.

278
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:51,376
You understand?

279
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,821
Times are changing.

280
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,482
You'll have to show me.

281
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,422
Mm-hm.

282
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,710
What can I do for you?

283
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,437
I want some information.

284
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:20,845
If I have it.

285
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:25,453
I've got some heavy dealers
sniffing around my street.

286
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,949
Why not go to your black friend, Arthur?

287
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:30,648
I have.

288
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:34,160
I assure you,
I'm not interested in your street.

289
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,594
I've given explicit instructions
to my associates.

290
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,028
How about Johnny?

291
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,635
Giovanni? He understands the situation.

292
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,661
I hope so.

293
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:47,500
Why make things so difficult?

294
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,772
My friend, I have the resources
to crush you in a matter of hours...

295
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:53,471
...if I wanted.

296
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:54,842
What would I gain?

297
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,210
A few people?

298
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:58,045
Trouble? Arthur?

299
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:00,987
I'm too old for that.

300
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:02,282
I wonder.

301
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:06,251
Import and export, that's my business.

302
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,225
Just so you don't import on my street.

303
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:10,059
You have my word.

304
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,066
Okay, we'll try it the old man's way.

305
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,897
It's a good deal, straightforward.

306
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:19,302
You better make a good pitch,
or I'll take care of that nigger my way.

307
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:23,410
Johnny, Mr. Nappa wouldn't like that.

308
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,403
Even a suggestion of violence.

309
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,514
Don't think.

310
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,714
You are not paid to think.

311
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,448
You are paid to talk.

312
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:39,823
And another thing, you fucking worm:

313
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,430
My name is Mr. Nappa too.

314
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,725
Mr. Nappa.

315
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,498
Don't you forget it.

316
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,007
I swear.
What do you want from me?

317
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,308
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Samson?

318
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:02,882
That's right.

319
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,780
I'm Michael Briggs.

320
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,614
I'm an attorney.

321
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:15,452
I understand, uh, you're the man
to talk to around here.

322
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:19,232
Well, uh, that depends.

323
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:24,135
Well, I represent a party
that has a business proposal for you.

324
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,568
Keep talking.

325
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:30,268
Well, it's, uh, rather confidential.

326
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,572
Okay, uh.

327
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:36,239
I know some place that we can go
and get by ourselves.

328
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:37,510
- Certainly.
- Follow me.

329
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:41,383
My lips are moving.
I think I'm talking. See if I'm talking.

330
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,100
Uh, I come up here a lot.

331
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:57,136
Come up here to think?

332
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,865
No, I just come up here.

333
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:04,534
Reminds me of when I was a kid,
you know?

334
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:09,173
When I wanna think,
I just heads off for the desert.

335
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,251
Heh-heh. That's a quiet place.

336
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,918
Well, it's more than that.

337
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,724
You know, you can get down
to what you really are.

338
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:20,724
Yes, sir.

339
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:25,691
There's my people down there.

340
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:33,072
All those souls
scrambling around, hustling...

341
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:36,005
...trying to make a living,
get a good time.

342
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,077
Mr. Samson?

343
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,847
Spit it out.

344
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,546
Mr. Samson,
it's a fact that you control this area.

345
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,224
Well, that's strong.

346
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:55,329
In any case,
I represent clients in the service business.

347
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:56,987
The Nappas.

348
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:58,826
I'm not at liberty to say.

349
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:02,233
Okay, I'll try to guess.

350
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:06,670
Well, my clients
want to open up your area.

351
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:10,140
And they're prepared
to make a very generous offer to you.

352
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,779
How much?

353
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:14,471
Fifteen percent of the gross.

354
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,049
Cash?

355
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,016
Can run as high as $200,000.

356
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:25,049
That's a lot of money.

357
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,921
It certainly is.

358
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:31,925
Well, that's the area down there.
Take a good look.

359
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,364
- What?
- Come on, take a closer look.

360
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,063
You're crazy!
Look at that shit.

361
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,367
Are you taking a closer look?
Please!

362
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,478
- I could drop you by mistake.
- Unh.

363
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:48,013
I can offer you 20 percent! Unh.

364
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,242
You don't understand.
I want these streets clean. Real clean.

365
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,413
I want you to go home and tell your clients
this neighborhood ain't for sale.

366
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,583
- I can't do that!
- You can't do that, huh?

367
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,922
Okay.

368
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,565
You can't do that,
your head's gonna open this cement.

369
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:05,859
Okay!

370
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,536
I don't want you to ever come back,
or I'll drop you.

371
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:17,777
You've had a rough time, Mr. Briggs.

372
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,477
You need a rest.

373
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:36,959
- How you doing?
- Just fine.

374
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,032
Haven't seen you in a long time.

375
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,065
You gotta look for me in the shade, man.

376
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:45,638
Uh, I might have some work for you.

377
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,799
Any time, any place, two bills.

378
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,003
You're the only thing
that hasn't gone up in this city.

379
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:53,809
Just give me a shout.

380
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,314
This door is my office.

381
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,451
That ought to keep you awake.

382
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,181
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

383
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:05,326
- Stay cool.
- Easy.

384
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,494
Hi, honey.

385
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,070
Hi.

386
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:19,797
You're new.

387
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:22,101
Today is my first day.

388
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:24,673
Do you know who I am?

389
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,279
Yes.

390
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:29,347
Tell the man I'm here.

391
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,747
I'm sure you know the way.

392
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,722
I would like to see you move.

393
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,127
My uncle is gonna keep you around here
a long time.

394
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:56,302
A very long time.

395
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,911
She's very easy to look at, huh?

396
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,944
You playing around, Uncle Joe?

397
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:12,855
A quick peek down the low-cut dress,
that's about all I am allowed these days.

398
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:14,551
Very sad, huh?

399
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,596
What the hell is all the money good for,
hey, Giovanni?

400
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:19,665
No charge.

401
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:23,961
Uncle...

402
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:27,672
...the gentle way didn't work.

403
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,400
Gentle way?

404
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,703
With the nigger, Samson.

405
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,676
Too bad. Stubborn.

406
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:33,871
He's an animal.

407
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:36,812
I couldn't do anything. Nothing.

408
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,248
We're losing face.

409
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,388
Don't make me laugh.

410
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,252
As long as he controls the streets,
our men can't be there.

411
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,455
Do you have something personal
against this man?

412
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:50,194
No.

413
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:52,196
He thinks he's a tough guy, that's all.

414
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,595
Maybe he is a tough guy.

415
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:58,471
- There's one way to find out, isn't there?
Giovanni.

416
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:05,510
Sometimes it is the measure of a man
to be wise and avoid a small trouble.

417
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,049
To take extreme measures,
that's a big step.

418
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:16,521
One cannot turn back.
There is no end until it is finished.

419
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,053
You're getting old.

420
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,622
Where is your pride?

421
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,234
You are talking to me that way? Pride?

422
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:30,997
What do you know,
with your fancy clothes and fancy women?

423
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:35,836
Are you suggesting that I,
Guisseppe Nappa, am afraid?

424
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:39,804
Do you want me to give you permission
to parade and play games?

425
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:44,543
I am suggesting that the black gangs
are nibbling at our territory.

426
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:48,177
I am suggesting there is one area
in this city that is unorganized.

427
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:52,918
We can take it.
We can take it and get back our territory.

428
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:03,468
Young blood.

429
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:07,574
It's always the same, testing themselves.

430
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:15,178
The smell of death, Giovanni,
it is not a nice smell.

431
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,020
I'm sorry.

432
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,859
If there were any other way,
I wouldn't have said a word.

433
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:31,556
Well, smart guy, you handle it yourself.

434
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:36,295
But if you get burned,
don't come running to me.

435
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,901
I won't.

436
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:42,303
It's a piece of cake.

437
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,405
Yeah, a piece of cake.

438
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:53,812
I know a man
who choked on a piece of cake.

439
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,387
Good crowd. Friendly people.

440
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,587
Yeah, not like last night, I'll tell you.

441
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:06,131
Forget about last night, okay?

442
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,501
All right.

443
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,530
If everything's fine, what's wrong?

444
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,435
Henry didn't show tonight.

445
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:14,973
Oh.

446
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,845
You're tired. Why don't we go home
and get some rest?

447
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:20,480
Get in bed with you and rest?

448
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:24,842
Hey, brother, could you spare a quarter...

449
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,385
...or some change or something for me,
babe, you know?

450
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,193
Samson!

451
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,176
Samson, stop! You'll kill him!

452
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:35,117
Stop it!

453
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,917
Stop it, you'll kill him!

454
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,392
Please.

455
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:45,827
You all right, baby?

456
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,738
You won't ever come back
on my street again, will you, brother?

457
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:56,070
No. No, man, no.

458
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:09,955
There's the quarter you asked for.

459
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,433
What are you drinking, baby?

460
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,043
Wine.

461
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,981
Rosé for a rose.

462
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:40,050
<i>You know, Playboy says champagne
over peaches is the thing.</i>

463
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:47,754
Now, you stop that.

464
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,258
Mama always said
dynamite came in little packages.

465
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:57,270
Psst.

466
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,340
Come on, baby.

467
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:06,571
Come, baby.

468
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:09,512
My love is coming down, mama.

469
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:20,751
Come here, mama.

470
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:32,901
I love the way you walk.

471
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,378
Love the way you move.

472
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,284
- I love you.
- I know.

473
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,024
- Hey, relax.
- Ha-ha-ha.

474
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:04,168
That was Johnny Nappa in the bar
the other day, wasn't it?

475
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:06,203
Yeah, that's right.

476
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,800
He's a bad dude.

477
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,935
So they tell me.

478
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,978
It's fact.

479
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:18,141
Don't worry about him.
You give him a pizza and he goes away.

480
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:24,089
You don't take anything serious, do you?

481
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,155
I take you serious.

482
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,593
I don't believe you.

483
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:34,064
Well...

484
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:39,239
...whatever we got, it ain't bad.

485
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:42,669
It's bad all right.

486
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,868
You're the bad man.

487
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,346
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

488
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,047
<i>You've got to help yourself
to lose those extra pounds.</i>

489
00:37:57,224 --> 00:37:58,248
<i>They'll kill you.</i>

490
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,326
- Oh!
- Ha, ha.

491
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:02,621
Baby, I think it's time you went to work.

492
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:04,958
- Me, go to work?
- Yeah.

493
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:08,295
- You like to dance, don't you?
- Sure.

494
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:11,233
Well, a fella I know needs a dancer.

495
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:13,066
- Are you kidding?
- Mm-mm.

496
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,935
What's it about, hmm?

497
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:18,306
Well, I wanna find out about this guy,
a nigger.

498
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:22,006
A nigger named Samson.

499
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,174
Ha, ha. A nigger?

500
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,149
Come on, Johnny.

501
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,948
You always said
you wanted to help me, baby.

502
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:31,523
And now here's your chance.

503
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,592
What can I do?

504
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:36,821
I want you to find out
about him. Everything.

505
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,694
I wanna know his habits, his patterns.

506
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:44,065
I wanna know where he goes.
I wanna know who he sees.

507
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,698
<i>You're looking good. Really looking good.</i>

508
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:48,398
I wanna know what his weakness is.

509
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:50,169
You understand?

510
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:53,307
<i>- Sort of.
- Have fun, girls.</i>

511
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,080
Just don't go playing around with him.
All right?

512
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,316
Why would I do that?

513
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,184
<i>Three, four.</i>

514
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,325
I'm just warning you in front, baby.

515
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:10,556
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

516
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:15,532
<i>More, more, more.</i>

517
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:18,934
<i>One, two. Now, let's sit up and rest.</i>

518
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,303
<i>And while we're resting,
let's just tuck into that double chin.</i>

519
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:24,637
<i>Chin up. Great. That's it.</i>

520
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:27,212
It was three, four, five,
come up in my dream.

521
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:28,439
Samson.

522
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,981
Hey, Shine.

523
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:33,416
Hey, man, you're looking clean and mean,
all flash.

524
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:36,886
- Always, brother. Look, I owe you one.
- You don't owe me nothing.

525
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:39,219
Look, I know what I owe you.

526
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:41,258
I've been rubbing around uptown.

527
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:46,025
Hustling a little pool,
a few chicks, and listening.

528
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,998
There's trouble coming.
They put one out on you.

529
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,161
What did you hear?

530
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:52,965
Oh, not much.

531
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,971
But enough.

532
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:59,608
Now, I don't know where
and I don't know when...

533
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,146
...but it's a contract job,
I could smell that.

534
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,443
Hmm. I appreciate this, Shine.

535
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:08,952
Shit, man, if it wasn't for you,
I'd be making license plates.

536
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:12,820
One thing, brother. Watch your back.

537
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,759
Because if they nail you,
they nail an awful lot of little people.

538
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:30,339
Hey, girl, what are you looking for?

539
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,502
Mr. Samson.

540
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,012
He's right over there.

541
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:36,914
Watch out for that lion.

542
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,676
Thank you.

543
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:49,953
Well, now, where did you come from?

544
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:53,457
- I hear you're looking for a dancer.
- That's right.

545
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:54,692
I'm here for the job.

546
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:01,365
Okay, let's see what you got.

547
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,900
Now?

548
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:05,307
Up there on the stage behind you.

549
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:11,683
- Henry.
Yes, sir.

550
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:14,719
You think you can play something
she can dance to?

551
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,517
Yes, sir, real funky.

552
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:18,715
That'll do it.

553
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,677
She's good.

554
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,479
Mm-hm.

555
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,387
Damn good.

556
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:56,093
Yeah.

557
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:01,064
Uh, knowing you like I do,
I'm sure you gonna give her a job.

558
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:03,500
- Sure am.
- Ha, ha.

559
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:07,169
Hey, hey.

560
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:18,481
Man, that white girl's almost got rhythm.

561
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:22,515
She sure foxy.

562
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:26,091
Shake your ass, baby. Shake it again.

563
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:28,285
Lay it out, mama.

564
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,002
Oh, no.

565
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:48,080
The reason I come in here
was to get away from the old lady.

566
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:56,682
What do you mean, "love"?
I mean love.

567
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:25,722
Who set me up?

568
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:27,799
Fuck you.

569
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:31,267
- Was it Johnny Nappa?
- Unh.

570
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:33,531
Was it Nappa?

571
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:38,707
- Well, take him a message for me.
Unh!

572
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:58,894
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

573
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:02,731
- Thanks, baby.
- Ah.

574
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,372
Wish we could always be like this.

575
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:11,101
Soon.

576
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:14,709
I just got a little more easy work to do,
and it's all gonna be mine.

577
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:16,543
What are you talking about?

578
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:18,548
Talking about that nigger.

579
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,279
Oh, he's not so bad.

580
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:23,082
What does that mean?

581
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,615
He's nice to me.

582
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:28,924
How nice?

583
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,462
Come on, Johnny,
I didn't mean anything.

584
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,190
He just talks to me.

585
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:35,767
You ain't found out nothing about him.

586
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,871
That's because there's nothing
to find out.

587
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:41,535
Come here.

588
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:46,039
Face up. If I find out
that you fucked that nigger...

589
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:48,147
...l'm gonna carve you nine ways.

590
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:53,246
- You remind me of him.
- Yeah.

591
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,617
Yeah, you know who signs the checks,
don't you, baby?

592
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,256
I sure do.

593
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:00,450
That's good.

594
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,289
All this worry
about some guy who runs a bar.

595
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:08,998
- Who's worried?
- All he cares about is that bar.

596
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:11,434
And Leslie.

597
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:14,233
He treats her like a queen.

598
00:48:14,508 --> 00:48:17,636
Oh, yeah?
How does Johnny treat his baby?

599
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:22,646
Sometimes he's not too nice.

600
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:26,041
We won't forget that, will we?

601
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:30,019
What the hell do you want?

602
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,021
I need to talk to you.

603
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:33,454
Out, Tina.

604
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,155
Out.

605
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:44,900
I told you not to come around here.

606
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,903
I had to.

607
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,808
Start talking.

608
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:50,739
We missed.

609
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,313
Isn't that too bad?

610
00:48:58,485 --> 00:48:59,918
How about a drink, Charlie?

611
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:03,056
Yeah, I could sure use one.

612
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:09,256
You know, it's really getting
to be a bad situation we have.

613
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:12,023
- We hire these people, and then nothing.
- Uh-huh.

614
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,996
Next time.

615
00:49:19,773 --> 00:49:22,640
Next time?
There ain't gonna be no next time, Charlie.

616
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,676
Unh! Somebody cued him.

617
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:47,123
You cunt, you bitch!

618
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:48,491
Johnny, no!

619
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:52,002
You told him.
You told that nigger bastard.

620
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:56,098
Johnny, no, I don't know anything!

621
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:58,744
I didn't do anything!
Johnny, please, I don't know...

622
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:11,886
What's the matter, baby?

623
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:14,527
Oh, Samson, you know.

624
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:19,560
What do you want me to do?

625
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:22,793
I want you to get out of their way
before they chop you to pieces.

626
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,129
Well, that sounds good.

627
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:26,135
Then why not?

628
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,941
The streets are clean.
The people trust me.

629
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:32,038
The people?

630
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:34,739
The people?

631
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:39,045
Your brothers and sisters
ain't gonna do no dying for you.

632
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,516
Look, Samson,
let's say you get by for a month.

633
00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:44,953
Two months, a year.

634
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,990
They'll get you.

635
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:48,985
Sooner or later.

636
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:51,096
They never give up.

637
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:54,165
You're just one man!

638
00:50:55,969 --> 00:51:00,303
When you're dead, they're gonna move in
and just take over anyhow.

639
00:51:01,508 --> 00:51:03,806
If I thought I could back off, I'd back off.

640
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,673
All you got to do is pack and get out.

641
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:09,008
It's not that easy.

642
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:13,450
This is the last chance
for our people to stand up.

643
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,679
Stand up and be a target?

644
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:18,552
Are you trying
to be some kind of martyr?

645
00:51:18,725 --> 00:51:21,523
That's it, you wanna die, don't you?

646
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:24,289
Well, I don't wanna love a dead man.

647
00:51:24,464 --> 00:51:26,398
That's sick!

648
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:28,158
I don't wanna sleep with a corpse!

649
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,929
A walking, talking dead on arrival.

650
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:34,637
I've got to hang on.

651
00:51:39,045 --> 00:51:41,070
I can't watch it.

652
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:43,675
I don't wanna lose you.

653
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:52,755
Well, I can't make it work.

654
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:58,697
You've got to understand.

655
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,800
Well, I don't understand, baby.

656
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:19,612
- Sounds funky, Henry.
- Thank you.

657
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:21,686
Real funky.

658
00:52:31,331 --> 00:52:34,129
Love that bourbon whiskey.

659
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:41,104
Yes, sir, in the hour of need,
it's the best friend a man could ever have.

660
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:45,472
You can take it with you anywhere.

661
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:48,205
You can take it for the blues.

662
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:51,009
Or the good old times.

663
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:55,245
Yes, sir, Mr. Samson...

664
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:59,381
...you're the only one
who still love to hear me play.

665
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,358
That's not true, Henry.

666
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,498
You still got it.

667
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,632
Hands like chicken claws.

668
00:53:09,803 --> 00:53:11,862
They hurt.

669
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,071
Play that "Bama Dust."

670
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:20,839
Oh, that "Bama Dust," that's real music.

671
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:31,153
I don't know where I learned that.

672
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:36,426
Oh, shit.

673
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:41,329
People don't listen no more.

674
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:43,662
They've forgotten.

675
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:50,335
But there used to be a time.

676
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:57,077
The war made them forget.

677
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:01,250
It run them crazy.

678
00:54:07,727 --> 00:54:11,163
I'm going back in the kitchen
to get me something to eat...

679
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,822
...if that's all right with you.

680
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:17,365
Yeah, that's all right. Go on back.

681
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:19,198
Thank you.

682
00:54:28,315 --> 00:54:30,840
I just wanna tell you
something heavy is coming down.

683
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,679
Something heavy on the streets.

684
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:36,515
It's aiming at me, and I ain't running.

685
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,223
I just wanna tell you
so you can stay out of the way.

686
00:54:41,394 --> 00:54:43,419
We know what's happening.

687
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:46,694
It's gonna be rough,
and it ain't your hassle.

688
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,357
It is our hassle, brother.

689
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,869
One way or the other,
it's coming back down in the streets.

690
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,269
At least, that's the way I see it.

691
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:58,206
And you've been handling the load
for too long.

692
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:01,544
I just want you to think about it.

693
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:03,609
We'll be around.

694
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:04,841
We'll be there, Samson.

695
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:09,720
I'm gonna have a good time tonight
if I have to kill myself.

696
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,982
Yes, baby.

697
00:55:12,158 --> 00:55:13,182
Hey, baby.

698
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,089
Sure are looking fine, Leslie.

699
00:55:15,261 --> 00:55:17,525
- Thank you, C.T.
- Good to see you again.

700
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:19,858
Arthur got your message.

701
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:50,223
Samson, my man.

702
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,156
Take care, brother.

703
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,732
Get happy, girl, get happy.

704
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:57,927
Well, if you loved me, baby,
you'd buy me some champagne.

705
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,766
Shit, if you loved me, you'd ask for beer.

706
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,373
- Hey, Samson.
- Yeah?

707
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:05,102
- Where's the dancer?
- Well, she didn't show.

708
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,609
She didn't show?

709
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,611
Jesus, white people are shiftless.

710
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,114
lt'd be okay if you were smart.
I am smart.

711
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,344
Why are you talking to me?
You a fine-looking woman.

712
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,614
That fine-looking shine
hanging on the wall...

713
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,519
...is my old man, and he ain't small.

714
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:21,558
He mean?
Meaner than that lion.

715
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:23,218
Busy as usual.

716
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:24,761
Where's the queen bee?

717
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:26,091
She's not around.

718
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:27,858
Not around?

719
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:30,730
You didn't do no doodah to that girl?

720
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:32,895
Ha, ha. No.

721
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,876
Well, I'm looking
for another place to flop.

722
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:40,137
Well, you can't stay here, Henry,
you understand?

723
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,644
Things are not cool.

724
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:47,583
l... I understand, but whatever. It's okay.

725
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:49,449
Here.

726
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:52,147
Go to a hotel and get some rest.

727
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,850
Hotel? Shit.

728
00:56:55,028 --> 00:56:57,155
Well, what are you gonna do?

729
00:56:57,697 --> 00:57:00,723
Live salty and die happy.

730
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,494
- Okay. Okay, Henry.
- Ha-ha-ha.

731
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,070
That Samson's a tough dude, man,
tough and straight.

732
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:09,697
I saw him mop up the floor
with two big apes right here.

733
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:13,312
No kidding?
Samson, mellow place, mellow.

734
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:19,676
Come.

735
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:27,021
Leslie, how you doing?

736
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,622
What's happening, Arthur?

737
00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:30,626
I'm moving, mama.

738
00:57:30,797 --> 00:57:33,630
Hey, it's been a long time.

739
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:42,641
I need some help.

740
00:57:45,178 --> 00:57:46,611
I'm listening.

741
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:48,679
Samson's in trouble.

742
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:51,282
I know that.
I thought you said you needed some help.

743
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:55,717
I do. For him.
- Oh, bullshit, mama.

744
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,983
Hey, he dug the hole, let him fill it up.

745
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:00,717
I warned that nigger.

746
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,691
Now his ass is on the line.

747
00:58:02,862 --> 00:58:06,229
And you're just gonna sit back
and watch everything, huh?

748
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,330
You got it, mama.

749
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:12,460
Just like old Satchel Paige,
I don't never look back.

750
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,238
You dirty motherfucker, you.

751
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,376
Ooh. Mama, say it again.

752
00:58:17,544 --> 00:58:20,513
Oh, you'd just love to see Samson down,
wouldn't you?

753
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,580
That's why you won't help.

754
00:58:24,784 --> 00:58:27,412
Shit on him.

755
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:33,889
Hey, wait a minute,
what do you think is going on out here?

756
00:58:34,194 --> 00:58:36,958
You got some idea
that this is some little honky kids...

757
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,724
...with some cap pistols or something?

758
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:41,457
There is a war happening, baby.

759
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:43,829
There's a whole army
pulling up out there.

760
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:45,436
So, what can he do?

761
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,937
He can get the hell out
or he can get some help...

762
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,234
...because the rest of it is jive bullshit.

763
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,538
- Listen, I thought for old times' sake...
- No, no, no, wait a minute.

764
00:58:53,713 --> 00:58:55,044
Now, you and I both know...

765
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:59,345
...that there ain't nothing staler or flatter
than somebody's old times.

766
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,649
And you and I both know
that he's not gonna ask you.

767
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:10,755
And I ain't about to hang my ass out there
for nothing, you understand?

768
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:15,796
Is there anything
that would make you change your mind?

769
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,639
Well...

770
00:59:28,615 --> 00:59:33,848
Well, if you was to come over to me...

771
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:36,815
...well, then I just might save
that nigger's ass.

772
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,355
Do you want me?

773
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:41,689
I always wanted you.

774
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:44,926
But I don't know about now.

775
00:59:45,098 --> 00:59:47,623
What would make it
worth your time, Art?

776
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:09,852
Something sweet and soft might help.

777
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,568
Hold it, mama.
Put them back on. I can't make it.

778
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:31,539
- I thought you said...
- Yeah, well, I thought too.

779
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,736
That's bullshit.

780
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,016
It's just a free fuck.

781
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:39,947
And I can't even do that for you now.

782
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,711
As for your friend, Samson...

783
01:00:44,657 --> 01:00:50,186
...well, he's just gonna have to be as big
and as bad as all those people think he is.

784
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:55,096
Because if he ain't, his brains
are gonna be all over that sidewalk.

785
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:58,169
So, what you're telling me is,
is that you're not gonna help.

786
01:00:58,338 --> 01:01:00,465
I'm telling you is that I am not a believer.

787
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,370
If he falls, tough shit.

788
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:05,511
But what if he wins?

789
01:01:05,678 --> 01:01:08,169
Oh, well...

790
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:13,281
...in that case,
I'll plan the parade myself.

791
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:21,922
C.T.

792
01:01:29,702 --> 01:01:34,139
You take care of yourself,
you understand?

793
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:41,041
Escort the lady out the back way.

794
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,068
You owe him something, C.T.

795
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,471
I'm Arthur's man,
and I can't solo it, mama.

796
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,476
Everybody's number comes up sometime.

797
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,637
Everybody's.

798
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,364
Let's get out of here.

799
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:50,048
"Go to a hotel."

800
01:02:50,216 --> 01:02:54,812
Shit, I'm gonna take that money
and go do me a flophouse.

801
01:02:56,589 --> 01:02:59,990
Know that lion is waiting for me.

802
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,226
How you do, pussy?

803
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,026
This is Henry.

804
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,029
It's me.

805
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:14,939
Hope Samson don't get mad.

806
01:03:15,107 --> 01:03:16,904
I'll put it back.

807
01:03:17,076 --> 01:03:21,570
Kitty, you know Henry is fair and square.

808
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:33,755
What the hell was that?

809
01:03:34,994 --> 01:03:37,656
What kind of shit going on?

810
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:46,029
Oh, shit, C.T.

811
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,142
C. T?

812
01:03:56,215 --> 01:03:57,239
Shit.

813
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:02,886
Old Henry boy.

814
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:06,024
He blew the whole goddamn place.

815
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,725
Motherfucker.

816
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,361
Henry's dead.

817
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:17,560
Coming down on the wrong man.

818
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:19,932
Well, what's Samson gonna do?
They own it all.

819
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,906
What the hell
is that damn boss doing down here?

820
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,243
So you've come to pick up the pieces.

821
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,744
The bastards are sure moving now.

822
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,747
- Why don't you ease up?
- Come on, Hoodoo.

823
01:04:31,918 --> 01:04:35,649
- Yeah, brother. Come on, Hoodoo.
What, do you think I play like this?

824
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:37,789
They got me too.

825
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,983
They shot C.T. He's dead.

826
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,793
And they grabbed your woman.

827
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:49,030
Watch it, champ, I haven't got her.

828
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:53,194
She just came up to my place
to get me to bail you out.

829
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:00,201
They just grabbed her.

830
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,244
- Do you know where they took her?
- Hell, no.

831
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:06,044
Wherever she is now,
she's just bait in a trap.

832
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:08,846
- So it's me they're after, huh?
- You got it.

833
01:05:09,021 --> 01:05:11,046
Well, where are you at now?

834
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:15,455
I'm studying the situation.

835
01:05:15,628 --> 01:05:18,859
Look, Samson,
will you try and stay cool?

836
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:23,297
Will you try and make a deal?
They own the game.

837
01:05:26,872 --> 01:05:28,737
Let's go, Hoodoo.

838
01:05:31,544 --> 01:05:32,909
Harry.

839
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:14,412
I certainly hope you're comfortable.

840
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:20,224
You guys hold her hand.
He'll be coming along sooner or later.

841
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,836
Let's move it.

842
01:06:56,896 --> 01:06:59,057
Oh, wow.

843
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:02,394
Wow, you really look
a lot better today, baby.

844
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,572
Well, I feel fine.

845
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,635
- How do you feel?
All right.

846
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:14,041
Where to, Mr. Nappa?

847
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:16,272
Oh, I don't know, uh...

848
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:19,374
Just around.

849
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:28,257
Yes, sir, darling,
I think you're gonna be all right.

850
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:31,055
Just don't be so mean to me.

851
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:33,561
Mean?

852
01:07:36,902 --> 01:07:40,861
- You know I'm sweet.
- Sometimes.

853
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:43,600
Hey.

854
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:45,767
Hey, say:

855
01:07:46,512 --> 01:07:52,348
"Johnny Nappa is a sweet guy."

856
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:57,578
- Johnny Nappa is a sweet guy.
- Ha, ha.

857
01:07:57,757 --> 01:07:59,782
Thank you.

858
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:10,295
Jesus Christ, did you see that shit?

859
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:12,801
- Somebody just dumped her.
Just take it easy.

860
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,903
Nigger-loving bitch.

861
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:30,554
She's pretty, isn't she?

862
01:08:31,757 --> 01:08:34,624
I bet she knows a lot about a knife too.

863
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,824
Tits.

864
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:42,792
Nice tits.

865
01:08:45,237 --> 01:08:47,000
Hmm.

866
01:08:48,274 --> 01:08:50,139
Nice ass.

867
01:08:57,183 --> 01:08:58,912
Too bad.

868
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:02,317
We gotta decorate them
for your boyfriend.

869
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,310
How you doing?

870
01:10:10,089 --> 01:10:13,616
- I'll get by.
- Yeah.

871
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:19,222
- Samson, you know why...
- I know. Johnny Nappa.

872
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:22,726
I knew it from the beginning.

873
01:10:23,702 --> 01:10:25,067
Look, it didn't matter.

874
01:10:25,237 --> 01:10:28,673
You couldn't have told him anything
he couldn't learn from the streets.

875
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:31,036
But they've got Leslie.

876
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:34,404
And they're setting it up for you.

877
01:10:37,616 --> 01:10:39,811
Do you know where she is?

878
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,815
Will you tell me?

879
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:50,590
Please.

880
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:09,072
Hank, Wade, Billie, upstairs.

881
01:11:09,248 --> 01:11:13,150
All right, rest of you guys,
outside with me.

882
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:48,080
It's that nigger bastard!
Look out, look out, watch it!

883
01:11:52,758 --> 01:11:54,385
Hey, hey!

884
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:57,558
What the hell is going on?

885
01:11:59,932 --> 01:12:02,162
Come on, get him.
Get out of my way.

886
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:09,865
Come on, let's get him.

887
01:12:47,046 --> 01:12:48,343
Billie.

888
01:12:48,714 --> 01:12:51,239
What the hell is going on in there?

889
01:12:51,717 --> 01:12:53,344
<i>Get him!</i>

890
01:13:07,099 --> 01:13:10,000
- Baby.
- Samson.

891
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:15,936
Goddamn it, answer me!

892
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:18,710
<i>What's happening?</i>

893
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:21,510
<i>Get moving.</i>

894
01:14:19,271 --> 01:14:21,637
I think I'm about to cry.

895
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:37,482
- Come on, let's go, hustle.
- Come on, let's go.

896
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:40,124
Come on.

897
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:42,487
Come on, let's get him, team.

898
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:13,117
Fucking crazy asshole!

899
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:40,112
What the hell is wrong with you?

900
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:42,549
I don't know what the hell you're doing.

901
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:43,979
That's my car.

902
01:15:44,156 --> 01:15:45,748
Hey, give me my car!

903
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:47,152
Give me my car back!

904
01:15:59,738 --> 01:16:00,762
Watch out!

905
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:02,099
Move! What the fuck?

906
01:16:02,274 --> 01:16:04,674
Look out, here comes another one!

907
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:11,843
Goddamn Mario Andretti.
Get on it, damn it, get on it.

908
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:32,261
What the fuck are you doing?

909
01:17:23,422 --> 01:17:25,720
Men, he's on his way.
Don't panic, move it.

910
01:17:34,032 --> 01:17:35,932
I need everybody.

911
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:38,331
Get that car moving.

912
01:17:41,006 --> 01:17:43,304
Come on, move, move, move.
Get inside.

913
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:46,876
All right, all right, come on.
Are you okay? Move it.

914
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:50,537
Now you get the truck.
Come on, people.

915
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:52,874
All right.

916
01:18:12,237 --> 01:18:14,933
Didn't you see the fucking truck,
you idiot?

917
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,042
Goddamn it, get it started!
He's getting away!

918
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:21,043
Move this fucking thing!

919
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:41,930
All right, move, you guys!

920
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,499
Into Samson's bar!

921
01:18:43,668 --> 01:18:45,260
Back in that hotel.

922
01:18:45,437 --> 01:18:46,836
Get up, Cord!

923
01:18:47,005 --> 01:18:49,166
Hey, Johnny, what's happening?
- Come on.

924
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:51,573
There's nobody in the buildings, Johnny.

925
01:18:51,743 --> 01:18:54,075
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know where they went.

926
01:18:54,246 --> 01:18:55,611
I'll look in here.

927
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:58,682
- Get out here!
- Come on, Johnny, what's happening?

928
01:19:13,732 --> 01:19:17,691
<i>Samson, Samson, Samson!</i>

929
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,222
Hey.

930
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:49,196
Yo, bring me that sink over there.

931
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,527
Honky having it.

932
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,567
Drop the damn thing, man. You got it.

933
01:20:05,984 --> 01:20:07,349
Hit it.

934
01:20:12,757 --> 01:20:16,022
I'll throw the whole
motherfucking building down on his ass.

935
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:22,799
Goddamn it!

936
01:20:38,617 --> 01:20:40,881
Look out!

937
01:20:42,954 --> 01:20:45,252
Bombs away.

938
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:57,064
Come here, white boy.

939
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:04,141
Out of my way. Bring them down.

940
01:21:09,648 --> 01:21:11,582
Look out, look out.

941
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:17,080
He's going down.

942
01:21:22,761 --> 01:21:24,820
Look out.
Look out.

943
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:39,570
I got you now, you white motherfucker.

944
01:21:42,881 --> 01:21:44,849
I'm going down.

945
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:14,008
Johnny!

946
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:16,540
Johnny!

947
01:22:16,715 --> 01:22:17,875
Johnny!

948
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:27,915
Hold it, man. Hold it there.

949
01:22:28,093 --> 01:22:30,220
Hold it, hold it. Don't throw nothing.

950
01:22:30,395 --> 01:22:32,022
Wait a minute.

951
01:22:44,976 --> 01:22:47,342
Get him.
They're gonna get it on.

952
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:52,210
You keep smiling, motherfucker.

953
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:03,224
Come on, kick the shit out of him.

954
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,989
All right, you piece of black shit.

955
01:23:06,498 --> 01:23:08,989
It's come to this, huh? You and me.

956
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:14,331
- Like you wanted.
- Yeah, just like I wanted it.

957
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:20,171
We're gonna do it, and I'm gonna put you
on your knees in front of your people!

958
01:23:20,345 --> 01:23:22,438
All of them!

959
01:23:24,282 --> 01:23:25,579
Come on, nigger.

960
01:23:41,066 --> 01:23:42,624
Watch out.

961
01:25:45,757 --> 01:25:48,658
You see him step on that sucker's head?

962
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,960
It's all right, baby.

963
01:25:51,963 --> 01:25:53,521
I know.

964
01:25:53,832 --> 01:25:57,461
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get you out of here.

965
01:25:58,136 --> 01:26:00,434
I don't wanna go anywhere.

966
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:03,202
Well, I thought...

967
01:26:03,508 --> 01:26:06,944
I thought we'd go away
for a while, and...

968
01:26:08,146 --> 01:26:11,479
No, you were right, Samson. It's here.

969
01:26:11,649 --> 01:26:14,413
Everything is right here for us.

970
01:26:19,524 --> 01:26:21,617
You did it, ma... Oh, I'm sorry.

971
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:23,852
I can't believe all of this.

972
01:26:27,498 --> 01:26:29,056
Is it coming down to me and you?

973
01:26:29,234 --> 01:26:32,294
No way, not a chance.

974
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:35,303
Look here, can you get us a bottle?

975
01:26:38,676 --> 01:26:39,768
I sure can.

976
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:43,175
I suggest that you do that, we take it,
go over there, have a drink...

977
01:26:43,348 --> 01:26:45,578
...and talk about all this mess.

978
01:26:52,991 --> 01:26:54,219
Like the old days?

979
01:26:54,392 --> 01:26:58,021
Just like them, brother.

980
01:26:58,363 --> 01:27:00,422
Come on.

981
01:27:01,165 --> 01:27:03,030
Look at what these people
have done here.

982
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:05,465
Would you, uh, take care of this,
man, please?

983
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,629
Look at this. Look at this.
