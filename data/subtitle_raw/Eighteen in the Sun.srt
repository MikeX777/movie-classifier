- Wake up, Sleepy!

176
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,857
What's the plan? What are you doing?
I'm sleeping.

177
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,821
I must sleep
Don't be silly.

178
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,412
Here on lschia nobody
ever sleeps!

179
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,167
- I'm fired, guys!
- Who's this?

180
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,107
It's Lars, the new Swedish
pool guy.

181
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,197
- Hello. - Hello. - Feel
the sun! - Pero talking!

182
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,612
He's a bit weird,
does not like Swedes ..

183
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,772
...I prefer Italians.

184
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,858
What a fool!

185
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,007
- Would you like something, sir?
- That's an idea ..

186
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,436
...But there's the problem of who
should pay for drinks.

187
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,892
Should we explain the
game for beginners?

188
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,724
- What is if?
- If <i>'s</i> his game.

189
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,212
It's very simple, you choose
a letter of the alphabet ..

190
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,668
...And the challenge
in thirty seconds ..

Starting with ..
with that letter.

193
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,117
But that's stupid,
and easy.

194
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,921
Not really, and those who can't
do if are called P.P.D.D.

195
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,486
Short on experience with women
and must pay for drinks.

- Come on, I will!
- Then, "S".

Don't help.
That's six.

Less than fifteen seconds,

- <i>Susanna.</i>
- <i>Mm.</i>

204

- Sister.
- Doesn't count.

205
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,882
-"Sister" does not begin
with "S"? - Come on!

206
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,292
By saying sister, you made if
with your own sister.

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,203
You lost,
you are a P.P.D.D.

208
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,227
- He must buy the drinks.
- Well, I don't drink.

209
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,160
- French cognac for ma.
- For me a whiskey.

210
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,813
Look at her.

211
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,442
Do you see that?

212
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,346
- Who are you?

213
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,887
Thanks, lady,
you've burned my eyes.

214

" Her? she?

She is very
difficult, my friend!

216
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,477
Anyone who has fried, struck out.

217
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,666
- <i>She does not get with anyone.</i>
- <i>Oh yeah?</i>

218
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,527
- Hey, where are you going?

219
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,419

224
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,338

<i>You're already in the grave,
Wake Up!</i>

226
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,678
Stop, come on,
I came here to rest.

227

I'll have a nervous breakdown, come on.

But, guys, I did
not have to point her out.

230
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,068
I saw her first; she's mine.

231
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,566
Stop if, monster!

232
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,012
This is the place?

233
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,163
What are you guys doing tonight?

234
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,607
- I don't know, what are you doing?
- There's a treasure hunt at the hotel.

235
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,353
- That would be good, are you
coming? - Well, I mean.

236
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,932
Hunting in pairs.
You understand, right?

237

Nicola, what are you doing?

241

You don't drink,
don't smoke, don't dance.

246
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,687
Sometimes you have relations?
Eh?

247
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,092
Relations? Ehh ...

248
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,679
<i>Imagine waiting in 'the

249
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,299
Beautiful, curvy, and a bit
shy, a little cautious.

250
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,426
I look at her, she looks of ma.

251
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,316
I approach, hiding
my intentions.

252

Stops trusting herself and me

253

- Now! - Now, you kiss?
- No, I'll shoot!

254

You shoot your women?

255
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,077
What women,
I was talking about the grouper-s.

All you think about are fish.

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,677
But I can't sleep outside.

513
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,717
It's uncomfortable, and it's wet.

514
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,582
<i>I'm an athlete, come on!</i>

515
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,243
On the third floor!

516
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,891
- Damn!

517
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,275
Finally! Three months in
Ischia with no rain!

518
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,947
Good night, sir.

519
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,297

524
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,571
No, if stings.
Why don't you shave?

525
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,028
That's my business.

526
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,427
Oh! What about the red-head last night?

527
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,316
- She had a problem.
- What?

528
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,267
She has a friend that
I like more! This one!

529
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,131

530

<i>You have two heads?</i>

531
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,707
Nanni, you'll ruin if.

532
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,028
- Enzo.
- Oh.

533
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,787
- Your mother is calling you.

534
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,507
Your mother has

Charles!

544
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,213
What is if?

545
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,482
I wrote our father.

546
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,053
There's the check, there's the check!

547
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,508
If will be a hundred thousand.

548
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,557
Our father will understand our
problem and helps us ..

549
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,563
<i>..</i> He was once young
foo, and he played poker.

550
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,347
- He knows how things go.
- Eh.

551
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,727
("Dear idiots, at the poker
fable don't you know, ..

552

553
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,110

<i>"I. have on idea.</i>

555

Huh?

556
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,910
- I <i>have an idea.
- No, no, no.</i>

557
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,223
<i>What an idea!</i>

558
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,687
We put a fen in from' and if
becomes one hundred and five thousand ..

559
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,148
<i>...And here where if says
five thousand</i> ..

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,004
<i>...We write one hundred in
from', elementary, no?</i>

561
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,343
No, that's scamming
our poor father.

562
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,807
Would you prefer that
Gennoro bust your face'?

563
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,962
You know Father can't afford if.

564
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,747
At' least it's
for the family.

565
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,946
Please, pretty lady,
give me Milan ..

566
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,434
...It's urgent stuff about women.

567
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,477
We won't be able to go home
for one thing.

568
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,211
Well? What do you care?
You like if here?

569
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,668
I don't know, and you?

570
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,842
Then we'll emigrate, like
swallows!

571
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,821
Germany! If seeks
Italians like bread.

572
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,837
What about money
for the journey?

573
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,981
You know what?
Write in two hundred and five thousand.

574
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,563
Simple, no?

575
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,172
What if we do not find work
right away?

576
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,676
<i>If will fake at'</i> least
<i>three hundred, eh?</i>

577
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,621
So make if for more.

578
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,766
Four hundred and five thousand.

579
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,556
Forgive ma, father!

580
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,108
It's almost time.
Careful.

581
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,263
Minus four, minus three,
minus two, minus one. 60!

582
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,246
Look of that, look of if.
And he is sleeping!

583
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,147
<i>Don't hit' me on the head,
I've got a nervous breakdown.</i>

584
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,123
No, you have another problem.

585
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,463
Listen, I should go in your place.

586
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,573
Not for a billion.

587
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,310
Besides, George is before us

588
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,397
Look Remo,
this should be working ..

589
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,187
<i>...There is no problem
with the under-wafer cable?</i>

590
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,692
<i>Be</i> calm, <i>there are</i> many
calls for Milan.

591
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,738
Ah thanks.

592
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,148
- Listen.
- Yes?

593
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,447
- What is our account?

594
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,116
The balance of your account's 28
thousand and 3 hundred pounds.

595
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,508
Here are
four hundred and five thousand.

596
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,642
<i>Give us the change.</i>

597
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,274
You don't trust us?

598
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,397
It's a check from our father.
You know the signature, right?

599
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,562
Of course I recognize
your father's signature.

600
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,893
- He's often here!
- It's like home.

601
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,611
Your father is a professor
of the University of Rome.

602
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,034
<i>- Yes
- Well?</i>

603
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,405
It's strange that he
wrote "four hundred' 'with a 6.

604
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,011
I'll kill you.
Illiterate!

605
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,013
Hello? Here is Milan.

606
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,516
Thanks.
Hello? Milan?

607
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,028
Richard, is that you?

608

Do you have the information?

609
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,878
She's a woman to die for?

610
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,766
I figured as much.

611
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,901
She lives in Via Borsieri?
Waif, let me write if down.

<i>Yes, we were in school together.</i>

625
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,931
You were in section "C" and
I in "B" right?

626
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,547
With Professor Marfinelli.

627
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,462

You live in Milan
Via Borsieri.

629
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,382
And then there's that girl,
what's her name?

630
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,772
Sandra, who always goes to Attila
the hairdresser.

Yeah, poor thing.
Even as a child.

Let's not talk about sad things.

638
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,532
Let's talk about something else, eh?

639
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,587
No, let's talk about my
brother. You are such good friends.

640
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,756
- Poor thing!
- Yes, poor fellow.

641
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,821

It'll cost me a lot of money, but
I'm not going to play if safe.

664

Down, get down.

Don't you think that it's
a bit too dangerous?

Are you going to buy explosives?

672

Oh yes!
From who?

00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,791
Terrible, I have a fever.

857
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,537
- Indigestion?
- No.

858
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,147
It's from the rain on the
fer-race last night.

859
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,028
<i>Here the athletes are</i> soft.

860
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,492
<i>A</i> few little drops of rain
make you sick.

861
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,692
Come on, don't look like that.

862
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,132
You're ugly when you
get angry.

863
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,572
Look, Nicole.

864
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,412
- <i>My sweet, darling</i> of <i>'the</i> some <i>name </i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

865
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,201
<i>I must tell you one thing
very intimate, very delicate.</i>

866
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,548
- Are you listening?
- Tell me.

867
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,861
Yes? You do not want to know,
Do you understand? 60!

868
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,947
<i>Idiot .</i>

869
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,083
- What do you think?
- If sucks.

870
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,367
No, I mean the leg doesn't
if seem a little swollen?

871
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,671
- <i>Should you eat</i> less?
- <i>One can also die</i> ..

872
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,347
...And you make fun of if.
By the way, ..

873
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,323
...How long will you be mad?

874
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,953
What do I know.

875
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,588
What is your brother doing?

876
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,852
It's my idea.

877
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,273
I put him to work.

878
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,092
<i>I read a statistic,
on Italian beaches</i> ..

879
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,902
Items are lost every day ..
jewelry or money ..

880
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,758
...Worth
fifteen million.

881
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,716
<i>Have you aver seen 'that
Eh?</i>

882
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,812
- How is if going?
- Nothing.

883
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,002
Ugh, but I'm hungry.
What time is if? Come on.

884
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,637
We' ll eat lunch!

885
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,983
- What about this?
- Ma ..

886
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,196
- You worry ma.
- Max!

Help, if is here.
the buried jewelry ..

888
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,301
...Somewhere.
Help, Massimo!

889
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,828
<i>At' last I've found you.
I've looked everywhere.</i>

890
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,608
<i>Vania .</i>

891
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,812
- Eh?
- Can you hear ma?

892
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,237
- Yes
- Ah.

893
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,139
Bu?!

894
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,846
- What is if?
- Evelin, she said ..

895
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,036
After the beautiful letter
that I wrote ..

896
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,197
...Definitely a yes. In fact,
The answer is very short.

897
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,373
I want you to translate if.

898
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,206
("Sorry but I cannot
accept your date.

899
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,773
<i>Either now or aver“).</i>

900
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,707
Fine! She was not that great.

901
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,060
Well! Now don't pretend you
don't care.

902
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,207
<i>Do you expect a woman to give
in immediately?</i>

903
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,444
Keep frying.

904
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,443
I already fried, foo much,
and I'm fired of if.

905
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,477
She clearly said no.

906
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,259
Am I wrong?

907
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,270
Let me finish, often women
say no, when they really want to.

908
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,162
If I were you,
I'd fry Evelin again.

909
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,038
Then I write
another letter?

910
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,750
No, no more letters.
This time you have to try ..

911
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,882
...To talk to her in person.
- About what?

912
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,030
(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
- Eh?

913
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,931
That's a verse of a ballad
popular in Berlin.

914
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,326
"On this day I'm in
love with you".

915
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,088
If' s beautiful!

916
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,812
Do one thing, write if on here.

917
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,667
Write how to pronounce if.

918
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,213
Who are you?

919
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,573
Quick, help ma.

920
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,172
- What do you want?
- Let me in.

921
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,994
My life is in your hands.

922
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,794
But you are a prisoner.

923
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,781
I am a fugitive,
I escaped from hell.

924
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,667
- From Procida?
- Yes

925
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,646
<i>We always fry</i> to <i>escape.</i>

926
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,052
They beef me for years and
years.

927
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,994
- You cannot understand.
- Calm down.

928
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,117
Calm down. Nobody will follow you now.

929
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,891
I'm afraid, yes, I'm afraid.

930
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,139
Hide me.

931
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,756
<i>Hide me, fake me anywhere,
but do not fake me back there</i>

932
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,535
Stay calm, stay cool.
This will help you.

933
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,713
- What is if?
- Whisky.

934
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,807
Good! I never drink.

935
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,163
- What are you doing?
- Let's go ashore.

936
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,591
No, stop! I know you want
to furn me over to the police.

937
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,422
- I'll pay you.
- Come on, I'm rich.

938
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,743
I do not need money.

939
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,402
Yes, but two million
would make you comfortable.

940
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,926
Oh, just stop if! Otherwise
I'll send you back.

941
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,677
Forgive ma!
I don't know who to trust.

942
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,518
They <i>have always been
so bad to ma.</i>

943
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,193
<i>I have to hide you
in a safe place.</i>

944
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,726
- Ah yes. In your own home.
- Yes

945
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,182
Ma .. maybe I'm wrong.

946
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,033
No, no. You are right.

947
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,746
Are there many people at' your home?
I don't know, brothers

948
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,156
No, my brother is at a party.
There is only a gardener ..

949
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,258
...But he never comes in the house.

950
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,172
Thank you, thank you.

951
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,277
<i>She“ we dance?
- No thanks, 1 don"t won't 'to dance.</i>

952
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,733
Listen, bring me some toast
and tea.

953
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,313
- Shall we dance?
- Of course.

954
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,603
- Hey, why did you do that?
- What?

955
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,353
You stuck your foot out
to make me fall.

956
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,083
Mg?

957
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,292
- Yes you.
- Maybe you stumbled.

958
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,657
- Who stumbled?
- Hey.

959
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,353
Don't touch the nose
or I'll kill you.

960
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,748
Stand still, little man.

961
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,853
Who are you calling little?

962
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,649
I'll break your face.

963
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,818
<i>Watch out, I'm an athlete.</i>

621' away.

968
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,578
I'm from Milan!

969
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,818
<i>We pay our 'taxes.</i>

970
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,819
We do foo.

971
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,898
You think I care?

972
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,933
- Don't you?
- What are you doing?

973
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,394
Looking of the girl?
Idiot!

974
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,538
I'm an athlete, remember.

975
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,573
You don't scare ma.

976
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,408
I'll break your nose.

977
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,732
Yes, yes, eat your toast.

978
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,228
I'll eat when I like.

979
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:19,974
No, no.

980
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,204
You're just materialistic.

981
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,428
Don't you realize the beauty
of the nature that surrounds you.

982
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,767
<i>- What do</i> I <i>care about nature.</i>
- <i>Oh, no!</i>

983
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,532
Here is a dream scenario,
a wonderful view ..

984
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,227
<i>.. On this enchanted bay.</i>

985
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,371
All those hairy men
with glasses, like you, ..

986
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,653
...They are insensitive.

987
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,646
You don't think of anything but
gorging on pasta.

988
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,603
That's not true! I also like
nature.

989
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,172
Sea? You see Naples,
Vesuvius.

990
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,277
You know that Vesuvius
is belching? -

991
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,228
Don' 1' smoke more!

992
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,342
It's all full.
I checked everywhere.

993
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,147
I asked if they could
accommodate you.

994
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,473
Ah, behold, there is one free.

995
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,371
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

996
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,874
<i>Oh no!</i>

997
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,587
Not this time!

998
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,406
Relax, it's not
important. I have another pair.

999
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,522
I'm sorry, I'm always
the same.

1000
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,382
So, it's not only swimming
that interests you, ..

1001
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,307
...But other sports foo.
- What would you suggest?

1002
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,196
Wrestling, for example.
It's a sport of sorts.

1003
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,113
Ah, for the twist?

1004
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,724
It's all been a misunderstanding.

1005
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,922
Then why did you trip that
guy?

1006
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,934
Mg?

1007
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,747
If was he who stumbled on
my foot and fell.

1008
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:10,894
Really.

1009
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,932
What's this?

1010
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,422
What we think when someone acts
like that.

1011
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,213
<i>At your service.</i>

1012
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,556
I recommend our
excellent fish soup.

1013
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,052
<i>Fish? No, for heaven's sake,</i>
I <i>would like a casserole in the oven.</i>

1014
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,428
- Sames as him?
- Me foo.

1015
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,169
Well.

1016
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,873
<i>One, two, three, four</i> ..

1017
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,268
...Five, six hundred, ..

1018
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,452
...Six hundred and thirty.

1019
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,732
And fifteen 'rip .

1020
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,012
Five is enough.

1021
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,533
- Do you see who is over there?
- Who is if?

1022
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,097
Your dream girl.

1023
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,452
Hello.

1024
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,483
I'm sick of my stomach.

1025
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,621
But did you see? Necklaces,
bracelets, pendants, ..

1026
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,523
...Rings.
If looks like a Tiffany window.

1027
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,863
<i>We need money .</i>

1028
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,917
Well, she's living in a fem'?

1029
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:03,723
What do you know?

1030
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,513
<i>The Americans are eccentric.</i>

1031
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,037
<i>"I. have on idea.</i>

1032
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,386
She's in love with you,
you're there, and she gives you ..

1033
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,204
<i>...A necklace.
- What about father?</i>

1034
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,157
Freed from the family yoke.

1035
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,123
I'll give you an example ..

1036
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,099
...From the films of Pasolini.

1037
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,447
Take off your glasses
and you won't be able to see.

1038
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,228
But she's an old woman,
built like jelly!

1039
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,228
I'm very sorry but only a
portion of lasagna was left.

1040
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,213
I could just cuss.

1041
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,971
- Who should I give if to?
- Miss.

1042
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,893
Thanks.

1043
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,493
Enjoy your meal.

1044
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,474
What are you doing this afternoon?

1045
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,382
Oh, I found a hidden place
that is perfect.

1046
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,043
Oh yeah?

1047
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,606
Then I'm coming foo, so
we can be together.

1048
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,957
No, no, no, you can't come.
I'm going to sunbathe.

1049
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,649
What do you mean?

1050
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,187
I sunbathe nude.

1051
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,062
- Exactly. I'm coming foo!
- You think you're clever?

1052
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,971
Well, you know, the air of
Ischia ..

1053
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,468
What is if called ..

1054
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,413
...This place?

1055
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,407
Sorry, but I go there alone.

1056
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,597
Why don't you surrender?

1057
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,353
<i>You would reduce the penalty.</i>

1058
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,651
No, I never will.
It's not your business.

1059
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,757
How do you know that song?

1060
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,814
Eh?

1061
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,222
<i>I heard if on the radio.</i>

1062
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,362
And this is a song of
art, ..

1063
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,453
..."A Grain of Sand."

1064
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,233
No, than if was copied.

1065
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,323
It's a song of the prisoners.

1066
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,892
Listen.

1067
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,111
(sings) I love finding finding ..

1068
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,548
...Inside a loaf ..

1069
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,187
...<i>A</i> file, a file, ..

1070
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,046
...<i>A</i> file of iron, iron.

1071
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,297
(sings) So I can escape.

1072
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,093
I'm done.

1073
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,259
What are you doing?

1074
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,860
I know how if feels after years
and years to see a beautiful woman ..

1075
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,853
...Like you.

1076
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,182
<i>You know, I've waited seventeen
years.</i>

1077
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,302
But you rob banks ..

1078
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,418
...And shoot at the cashiers

1079
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,028
But I had no money, you understand?

1080
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,422
You only understand about
wealth.

1081
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,777
With this villa.

1082
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,787
What do you know about poverty?

1083
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,113
But I like you anyway.

1084
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,021
What are you doing? Perhaps
we should go.

1085
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,526
I prepared a delicious lunch.

1086
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,658
No, I'm not hungry.

1087
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,051
But how? For years you only
eat bread and wafer.

1088
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,346
Exactly, my stomach Shrunk.

1089
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,363
Yes, I got skinny.

1090
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,331
Come on, you will feel
much better after-word.

1091
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,458
Come on.

1092
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,547
Come, do not be afraid, I sent
the gardener away ..

1093
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,092
...Until tonight.
Now sit down.

1094
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,828
<i>And 201'.</i>

1095
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,746
This omelette is very good.

1096
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,797
No, look, this is a steak.

1097
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,099
<i>A stack?</i>

1098
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,153
<i>Than these are stacks.</i>

1099
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,593
Why are you looking of ma?

1100
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,863
Because you're different.

1101
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,692
- Eh?
- You're so different ..

1102
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,068
...From all the boys
I know.

1103
01:11:59,160 --> 01:11:59,649
<i>Ah.</i>

1104
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,550
You know, the usual idiots I
date, spoiled, rich.

1105
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,593
What do they know of life?

1106
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,087
They do not understand anything,
while you instead ..

1107
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,682
...You fried to
get ahead, ..

1108
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,017
...out of poverty.

1109
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,612
<i>- Maybe even shot
- Oh yes.</i>

1110
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,350
Life is strange!
Just when you think you're fired ..

1111
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,788
...Comes Ischia.

1112
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,476
...Comes Ischia.

1113
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,922
<i>A</i> fling, and other nonsense.

1114
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,978
What a shame!

1115
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,647
- Why don't you surrender?
- Do not meddle ..

1116
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,369
...in my business.

1117
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,548
- <i>Come here!
- No, no, no.</i>

1118
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,153
Now you go to sleep.

1119
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,651
Sleep? Don't even think about if.

1120
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,548
But how? You spent three days
and three sleepless nights ..

1121
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,374
...In the middle of the sea.
- Me?

1122
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,473
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I
remember

1123
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,868
Don't make a fuss, come!

1124
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,813
Oh, of course, of course.

1125
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,467
Listen.

1126
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,597
After ...

1127
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,387
After, you will come to ma?

1128
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,413
Yes, yes.

1129
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,067
- So I'll be quiet?
- Yes

1130
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,813
<i>Who? happened, have

Why?

Are you alone?
Where is your brother?

1133
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,157
He is making
a great sacrifice.

1134
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,987
<i>A</i> sacrifice for the common good.

1135
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,817
He is a true brother
in times of need.

01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,084
Well? How was if?

1137
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,308
I'm ashamed!

1138
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,173
I've become a call girl.

1139
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,006
Here I'll get some sleep!

1140
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,423
And that's my morn?

1141
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,492
Uh, my morn.

- Accepted.

1151
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,207
Has he set up house down there?

1152
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,371
What strength.

1153
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,584

You must come with us now.

1161
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,797
Me? Are you kidding?
I did nothing.

<i>I have things to do.</i>
I <i>have the quarter-finals.</i>

1163

You must come with the police.

1164
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,033
They're making an example of him?

1165
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,833
Please, let me dive, and
than I'll turn myself in.

I'm sorry, those are our orders.

1168
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,868
Sorry, the flippers.

1169

Well than

1170
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,517
They're really faking him away!

1171
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,963
- But what has he done?
- Maybe for traffic violations ..

1172
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:28,939
...or drugs.

1173
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,997
Don't be stupid.
Pay up on the bet. Next!

1174
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,061
No, my friend, no payment,
the race was not run.

1175
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,236
- So I'll keep the drinks for myself.

Sure.

I understand if, but that's not
much of an explanation.

cold. - Ah, yes?

1201
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,327
Now that she is almost falling ..

1202
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,754
...At my feet,
I understand ..

1203
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,047
...That only her resistance
piqued my infer-est.

1204
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,298
Now I don't like her as much.

1205
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,927
But you said that she was
hot and impetuous.

1206
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,651
Yes, but I don't like that,
and then the German ..

1207
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,746
<i>...It's foo different, we
can't talk to each other.</i>

1208
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,548
The language is an obstacle.

1209
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,726
Instead, a girl like you

1210
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,466
I fell you that I love you
and you understand ma.

1211
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,447
Maybe we should hold hands.

1212
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,421
- Hold my hand ..
- What?

1213
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,788
- We can't kiss?
- No.

1214
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,622
Didn't you understand?
I said that I love you.

1215
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,762
And I'm felling you no.

1216
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,828
And I don't care at all.

1217
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,627
What are you doing? I fold you no.

1218
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,387
Remember what you taught me?

1219
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,049
<i>What?</i>

1220
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,221
When a woman says no
if means maybe.

1221
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,676
Here, every kiss
reminds me <i>..</i>

1222
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,228
that our debt

1223
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,458
No, really, it's yours.

1224
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,777
I ruined the vacation.

1225
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,162
Loving all the women.

1226
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,363
At' least you got some in your
adventure.

1227
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,852
- Please do not remind ma.
- Come on, come on.

1228
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,332
<i>- Where?</i>
- <i>Our</i> last <i>chance.</i>

1229
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,347
- To settle the issue with Gennaro.
- I'm coming foo?

1230
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,403
- Hello.
- Hello!

1231
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,373
Let me.

1232
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,787
Did you know
Nicola was arrested?

1233
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,858
Who knows what he has done!

1234
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,779
Now what do we do?

1235
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,723
This is what we do, we drink
to something!

1236
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,393
Yes, but who pays?

1237
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,461
All drinks limited to
five thousand. Deal?

1238
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,837
- Always ready, brother.
- So, come on.

1239
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,684
This time I'll get you.
"z"

1240
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,659
"z"?

1241
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,380
<i>Zaire, Zulu, Zena, Zita,
Zelmira, Zoe, ..</i>

1242
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,807
<i>...Zeferino, Zurlini, Zenobia
- Nine </i>

1243
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,340
- Zenobia Zikipaki-Zikipu!
- And who is Zikipaki-Zikipu?

1244
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,748
The daughter of a great chief.

1245
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,454
Ah, you're back.
Where's the seventy thousand?

1246
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,853
This is if, and give us the change.

1247
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,206
This is glass, cheap glass.

1248
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,423
So?

1249
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,868
We ask you to let us
step aside for a moment.

1250
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,981
Fine, fine, just bring me
the money.

1251
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,766
- Look, I've got on idea.
- Help ma, Mother

1252
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,638
- You go over and cause a fight.
- Me?

1253
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,212
- Yes, why not?
- He'll punch ma, no, no.

1254
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,931
It's simple, listen, you
have glasses

1255
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,819
Eh.

1256
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,162
If he punches a guy with glasses,
he could go to jail.

1257
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:23,729
Ah!

1258
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,845
But if we do not press charges,
he'll forgive the debt, eh?

1259
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,908
You think we should do if?

1260
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,452
60 now, be quiet,
go, go.

1261
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,262
Bring if on. Come on, bring if on!

1262
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,233
- Sir.
- Um

1263
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,402
- Courage.
- Urn

1264
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,834
Waif a minute.

1265
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,230
Dear Mr. Gennaro,
we would like forgiveness ..

1266
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,647
<i>...of the seventy thousand
Italian lire </i>

1267
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,983
Absolutely not.

1268
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,703
Wretch!

1269
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,251
Thanks, Mother,
I'm such a man.

1270
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,292
<i>Oh , poor dear .</i>

1271
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,963
- Ah!
- Shut up, I feel like..

1272
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,132
I'm lost.

1273
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,767
- <i>Hold on, please.</i>
- I <i>like you,</i> I <i>love you.</i>

1274
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,956
<i>For years
1 have not seen a woman.</i>

1275
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,804
I do not even remember
what they are like.

1276
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,091
Frankly, all I know
about women ..

1277
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,652
...I learned from stories of
friends, the doodles I did ..

1278
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,154
...On the walls of the cell.

1279
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,856
Enough with the theory,
Teach me how to kiss.

1280
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,851
Nanni, listen.
You must return to prison.

1281
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,922
<i>- No, never.
- You have 10.</i>

1282
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,452
No, if I go back to prison,
I'll be there when I'm old.

1283
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,477
<i>I'd better take advantage
of this opportunity.</i>

1284
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,573
- I ..
- I should stay out.

1285
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,717
Nanni, listen, when you get out
of prison ..

1286
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,148
...You will be thirty-seven.
- Eh.

1287
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,732
You will have a new life,
and than I...

1288
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,286
than I might love you.

1289
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,374
<i>Y u“?</i>

1290
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,706
- You love ma?
- Yes, but on one condition.

1291
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,446
Now you pick up the phone,
call the Commissioner ..

1292
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,783
. . And return.

1293
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,367
So you will not
increase your punishment.

1294
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,886
- Call.
- No, I can not.

1295
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,378
But why?

1296
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,372
Why do you want me to go back
to those people?

1297
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,030
You do not know what life is
like in a cell ..

1298
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,572
...And forced labor,
a cell and forced labor.

1299
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,047
<i>It's better to enjoy these days
of freedom on the run</i> ..

1300
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,884
...Like a beast,
before I go back, ..

1301
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,861
<i>...The penalty will increase,
but</i> I <i>really don't care.</i>

1302
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:52,990
You know why? Here alone,
I'll have something to remember.

1303
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,007
The unforgettable hours
spent with you.

1304
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,412
Yes, yes, dear.

1305
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,532
Operator?
I want the Commissioner.

1306
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,297
Hello, Commissioner?

1307
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,739
Commissioner.

1308
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,918
My name is Nanni Colizzi.

1309
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,532
I escaped from Procida
and I want to surrender.

1310
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,438

1313
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,126
- Molino, Nicola!
- Ah, that's ma.

1314
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,208
Good morning.

1315
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,338
Come in.

1316
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,403
Excuse me, I was stripped,
but they brought me ..

1317
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,767
...my clothes
and I have not had time ..

1318
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,938
Si? down.

1319
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,951
This is an injustice, you know?
Why am I treated like a thug?

1320
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,763
Do you know that the quarter-
finals are ruined?

1321
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,790
<i>- What has been ruined?</i>
- <i>The quarter-finals, the race.</i>

1322
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,717
- I protest.
- You can protest ..

1323
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,643
<i>...Because you are known here,
are you not?</i>

1324
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,683
<i>I don't know, but</i> I <i>am innocent.</i>

1325
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,252
- <i>Innocent.
- Of course, what have</i> I <i>done wrong?</i>

1326
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,230
<i>- Where were you earlier?
- Well, of lunch.</i>

1327
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,517
- And than?
- And than

1328
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,781
<i>Then, before the race,</i>
I <i>was on the beach.</i> ..

You're not going to eat?

1367
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,324
I don't want to eat with you!

1368
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,542
Ah, well! You're the guilty
one, eh?

1369
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,301
What should I say? You've
ruined the quarter-finals, ..

1370
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,051
<i>...You've ruined everything,
I've even been sent to</i> jail.

1371
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,021
You want to see me on the
guillotine? on the gallows?

1372
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,514
I've denounced you.

1373
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,858
Spy.

1374
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,470
You're right! So learn to
sunbathe in your swimsuit.

1375
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,747
What do you want?
Are you jealous, eh?

1376
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,778
Of him?

1377
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,378
You' re imagining.

1378
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,267
Then you're a moralist.

1379
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:00,061
<i>Stop! You can</i> call <i>me
whatever you like</i> ..

1380
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,633
<i>...as most French.</i>

1381
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,957
But what annoys me most ..

1382
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,508
...He got to see more than ma.

1383
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,327
Do you know what I would have given
to fake a peek, eh?

1384
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,733
<i>What?</i>

1385
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,458
<i>A</i> lot!

1386
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,462
<i>I mean,</i> I <i>have no reason 'to</i>
think <i>that you would.</i>

1387
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,627
What do I know about you?

1388
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,246
Only that you care about
under-wafer fishing, ..

1389
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:24,041
...That you don't like women.
Indeed, I have the impression that ..

1390
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,058
...You get nervous.

1391
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,300
I like women a lot.

1392
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:31,387
Don't you think I'm cute?

1393
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,727
You've never fried to kiss
me.

1394
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,186
<i>Have you never kissed
o woman?</i>

1395
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,148
<i>I behave you have.</i>

1396
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,243
I held my breath for 30 seconds.

1397
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,243
- Is that a record?
- Well, almost.

1398
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:06,899
Well?

1399
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,532
You, guys.

1400
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,698
Oh!

1401
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,499
<i>Hey'</i>

1402
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,188
- <i>Eh?</i>
- <i>Please.</i>

1403
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,282
That's not a good idea ..

1404
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,886
<i>...This is not the place
to make out.</i>

1405
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,923
- Excuse us, Commissioner.
- You're excused.

1406
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,651
I spoke with agent Sassu, and
the misunderstanding was cleared up.

1407
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,802
- So, can we go?
- It's all over?

1408
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,678
You have to pay
a fine.

1409
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,818
<i>Oh , okay .</i>

1410
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,197
- You can go. - Goodbye,
Commissioner.

1411
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,418
- Goodbye.
- Good day.

1412
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,153
- If we hurry, we may have
time. - For what?

1413
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,612
- To sunbathe before
sunset. - Okay, let's go.

1414
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,037
<i>A</i> sunbath at sunset.

1415
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,019
Bu?!

1416
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,418
Commissioner.

1417
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,547
An urgent call.

1418
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,747
I knew if.

1419
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,132
<i>Where am Y?</i>

1420
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:10,778
<i>In the middle of the ocean?</i>

1421
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,508
She tricked ma.

1422
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,467
I'm stranded in the ocean.

1423
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:19,733
Help.

1424
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,193
Oh, damn if!

1425
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,228
Which way should I go?

1426
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:45,700
<i>Oh, Mother, who? have I done
to deserve this?</i>

1427
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,868
621' out!

1428
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,847
<i>What</i> I <i>want, ma'am,
when</i> I <i>come here ..</i>

1429
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,287
...<i>A</i> guy like ma,
modestly, to have all of them ..

1430
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,134
<i>..</i> In my arms.

1431
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,708
<i>Did you have many adventures?</i>

1432
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,313
I'd rather not talk about if.

1433
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,437
I understand, you're a gentleman.

1434
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,807
Hove you booked a hotel
in Capri?

1435
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,957
- The Quisisana.
- Me foo.

1436
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,011
<i>We must ensure</i> that <i>these
inconveniences</i> stop.

1437
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:30,763
Don' 1' you think?

1438
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,726
Oh sure. What could be done?

1439
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,430
- I don't know.
- Let's get married.

1440
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,326
<i>Just think,</i> I <i>would not even
have to change</i> my <i>surname.</i>

1441
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:42,923
Eh!

1442
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,396
<i>And you wouldn't have to
sleep on the fer-race.</i>

1443
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,660
I'm going to sneak a kiss.

1444
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,692
<i>Look, someone dropped o hot
"m the sea.</i>

1445
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,542
- Make a wish.
- Quick.

1446
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,454
Tell ma?

1447
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,108
Goodbye!

1448
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,587
- Lucky them!
- Eh!

1449
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,972
We'll see you next year!

1450
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,537
Work! Work!
Spartacus!
