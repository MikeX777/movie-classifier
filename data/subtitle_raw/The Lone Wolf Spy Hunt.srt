1
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:19,268
Robbery?

2
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,026
Murder?

3
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,378
I see, you guys take me for a ride.

4
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,475
- Can I have a cigarette? - Shut up!

5
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,556
We'll return them right away.

6
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,593
Good evening, Mr. Lanyard.

7
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,512
I don't think I'll like you.

8
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,739
Sorry if my men were too rude...

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,535
...but it was necessary to bring him here. - Why?

10
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,792
There's a safe I want you to open.

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,730
Did you forget the combination?

12
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,150
- The safe is not mine. - That seems illegal to me.

13
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:16,624
I'll pay ten thousand dollars for the job, Mr. Lanyard.

14
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,913
So? That say?

15
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:22,069
N�o.

16
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:23,875
Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

17
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,258
Listen, whoever you are, I don't like your tone,

18
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,780
...I don't like your manners and I don't like men...

19
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,290
... who handed me their invitation.

20
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,206
I think this clarifies everything.

21
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,092
I'm sorry, Mr. Lanyard.

22
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:38,507
And now what happens? Is there a good torture chamber waiting for me?

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,772
- Or maybe a dark dungeon? - None of that.

24
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:45,591
As long as you're not interested, you're free to leave.

25
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,892
Levem-no.

26
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:51,774
It was a pleasure.

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,835
Turn on the lights.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,380
Let me guess, boss.

29
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,655
If we can break into this safe without Lanyard's help,

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,215
...I can't understand why you made us bring you here.

31
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:14,491
I have an old account pending with the Lone Wolf.

32
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,030
He once got me into serious trouble.

33
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,807
I still don't understand, sir.

34
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:22,033
And now I'm going to do the same for him.

35
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,748
Wouldn't you like to change your brand of cigarettes, Jenks?

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,318
- Oh! - Only tomorrow.

37
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,473
Hey, that would be great.

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,604
We will proceed exactly as agreed.

39
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,023
Plans must be withdrawn from the War Ministry at noon.

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,186
You'll take care of that at lunchtime,

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,139
...before they can be copied.

42
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,018
Exactly, what disappeared?

43
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,575
Listen, Sergeant, one more time: the missile plans...

44
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,303
... Palmer's anti-aircraft was stolen, understand?

45
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:09,177
- Yes. - But they didn't take all the plans.

46
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,728
See, inventor Palmer has several of the codes in his lab.

47
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,142
why?

48
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:21,489
Because he is working to simplify the loading mechanism.

49
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,167
- You still don't understand? - Yes I understand.

50
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,305
The thieves only took part of the plans.

51
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,980
That's right, sergeant.

52
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,558
- And what were they? - It doesn't matter now.

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,020
Our job is to catch these thieves before...

54
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,121
... that harm them. - Any leads, Inspector?

55
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,147
A great work like this is not seen often.

56
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,851
- Sir, but... - Now, listen, Inspector.

57
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,718
I would like something more concrete.

58
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,734
Well, some men can open a safe like that.

59
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,820
- One of them is Eddie Elk. - Yea?

60
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,200
But he's in Sing-Sing, turning 50.

61
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,160
Oh.

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,041
- There is another man. - I assume he's in Alcatraz.

63
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:57,107
- Actually, he's here in Washington. - great.

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,834
- And he used to smoke Regis cigarettes. - Regis cigarettes?

65
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,914
I found this on the floor in front of the safe.

66
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:05,193
Did you find them, Inspector?

67
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,573
I had no idea the police were so efficient.

68
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,283
Do you want me to arrest you, Inspector?

69
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,101
Wait a moment. I just said he could have done it.

70
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,300
In fact, he's been out of this business for a long time.

71
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,675
He's been retired for years.

72
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,568
But I swore that when I caught him it would be for life.

73
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:19,400
I'd negotiate my pension to get him.

74
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,975
- Who is it? - The smartest safecracker in the world.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,687
Michael Lanyard, o "Lobo Solit�rio".

76
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,258
Fique onde est� "Scarface".

77
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:45,062
- Oh, Mike. - What's up, Pat?

78
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,625
Why doesn't Jameson die when I shoot him?

79
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,358
This makes me very angry.

80
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,390
Jameson, why don't you die when she shoots you?

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,050
I'm very tired, sir.

82
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,775
These violent pranks today were Ms. Patricia.

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,925
She says she's finishing off the "Red Weasels".

84
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,290
Is this for me?

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,455
Oh wow! A real FBI costume! And real handcuffs! Wow!

86
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,038
Come closer, I have something to tell you.

87
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,280
- A detective story? - No, it's about you.

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,089
It is a serious matter.

89
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,544
Talk about the kitchen window?

90
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,351
- Really, my cat... - No, it's not about that.

91
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,887
I'm sending you to boarding school, Pat.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,465
Oh Mike, why?

93
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,675
If your mother lived, I could take good care of you.

94
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,175
I'm afraid I'm not good at being a father.

95
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,980
You are the coolest dad in the world.

96
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,715
No, no! Don't flatter me, young lady.

97
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,575
Tomorrow I'm taking her to Mrs. Warren's fantastic boarding school for young ladies.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,696
Young ladies? You mean little girls.

99
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,687
- Does Val know anything about this? - Val?... no.

100
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,560
But when I see her, if I see her... Ali�s, Jameson,

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,227
How many times did she call today?

102
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,716
Miss Carson called at 3:15, and she didn't call until 4:00, sir.

103
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,637
At 16:15 you tell her I'm going to take a trip to Canada.

104
00:07:12,662 --> 00:07:14,252
I'm afraid this is not good for you, sir.

105
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:15,738
- No? - No, sir.

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,917
- She's very persistent, isn't she? - Very much, sir.

107
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,300
Mr. Lanyard, wouldn't it be easier if you married Miss Val?

108
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,715
Easy isn't the word, Jameson.

109
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,775
- Anyway, we couldn't. - No, sir?

110
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,609
No, she's too young for us.

111
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,616
- We're too old, Jameson. - Well, you're only 35 years old.

112
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,596
If you can't marry her, sir,

113
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,130
...what are you going to tell him so he doesn't explode again?

114
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,275
I don't know, why don't you think of something?

115
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,800
I can't talk to her. I left it planted in the restaurant all of a sudden.

116
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,457
- That explains everything, sir. - Explain what?

117
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,900
- What she said, sir. - And what she said?

118
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,032
Er... no, sir. I cannot repeat it, sir.

119
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,168
- Jameson, I think I need a drink. - Yes sir.

120
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,203
Oh, I forgot, sir, look at this.

121
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,440
Glad you came. Mike plans something terrible for me.

122
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
When I'm done with that bad father of yours,

123
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,638
...he won't be able to do anything to anyone.

124
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,965
He intends to send me to boarding school.

125
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,475
Oh, it tries to get rid of you too, doesn't it? We'll see that soon.

126
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,685
- Are you mad at him again? - Brave?

127
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,175
Do you want to see your father torn to pieces?

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,690
I think it would be better if I stayed here, thank you.

129
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,985
You... disgusting traitor!

130
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,320
What have you been doing, stealing money?

131
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,000
Jameson, what is this woman doing here?

132
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't interrupt me, where were you at lunchtime?

133
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,240
- I got a call. - Two hours on the phone?

134
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,320
Well, it was long distance.

135
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,925
Don't be a joke. Get up, I want to talk to you.

136
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,226
Do you realize...? Sit down!

137
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,575
Do you realize what you did to me?

138
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,128
- No, what? - You ran away from me.

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,850
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Do you really feel?

140
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,902
Sim.

141
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,665
- Okay, I forgive you. - Forgive me?

142
00:08:57,675 --> 00:09:00,633
- Yes, I forgive you. - I knew you would understand.

143
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:03,088
- Just one more thing. - What?

144
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,795
- The bill. - Oh, I forgot about her.

145
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,840
- Yes, I had to pay it. - Oh!

146
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,074
I erased.

147
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,751
Oh, one can forget these things, especially when...

148
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,492
...when you're so busy... How much?

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,690
- How?... For lunch? - Yea.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,290
And can you still walk?

151
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:26,432
I invited some friends to keep me company. great people.

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,045
Yeah, don't tell me? Here's $45, including tip.

153
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,238
50. We had a great waiter.

154
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,902
We have to meet for lunch sometime.

155
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:41,701
By the way and just out of curiosity, where did you go this afternoon?

156
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,375
I received a business call.

157
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,675
Oh yes, I hope it wasn't collect.

158
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,055
Jameson, the doorbell is ringing.

159
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:48,300
Oh, Sr. Lanyard!

160
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,068
Forget it, I'll take care of it myself.

161
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,750
- Don't change the subject, where were you? - Excuse me.

162
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,706
- Listen, Mike... - We've got company.

163
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,565
- Voc� � Lanyard? - Sim.

164
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,075
Inspector Thomas! How are you, Inspector?

165
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,590
- great. How much time. - Yes, Miss. Carson, Inspector Thomas.

166
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:07,286
E...

167
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:09,029
Sargento Devon, Sr. Lanyard e Srta. Carson.

168
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,100
- How is it going? - Pleasure.

169
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:11,408
Come in, gentlemen.

170
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,325
You're in time for a drink, Inspector.

171
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:17,450
I'm afraid this is official business, Lanyard.

172
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,514
Same?

173
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,700
Val, get us a whiskey or something to drink.

174
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,765
Oh no. I like the police.

175
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,557
It's not every day that we can socialize.

176
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,375
Look, inspector, that guy looks like he's handcuffed or something.

177
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,343
Oh, it's Jameson. He and my daughter are playing.

178
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,760
Just kidding, this looks very suspicious.

179
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,378
- Miss Patricia, please. - Oh, no. Not until you promise.

180
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:45,819
Lanyard! Where were you at 1 am this afternoon?

181
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:48,669
- Thank you, Inspector. - Why?

182
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,675
That's what I'm trying to find out too.

183
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,423
- That's very suspicious. - Hands up!

184
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,117
See, Jameson? That's how we should play.

185
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,824
- I liked him! - He's taking her to boarding school tomorrow.

186
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,239
Yes... for a reformatory.

187
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,130
Val, do you want to help Jameson break free?

188
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,475
When he's stuck, he doesn't feel comfortable.

189
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,285
Please Miss Val.

190
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,026
Pat, d�-me a chave, r�pido.

191
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,354
Oh no! Not until he promises to die 3 times tomorrow.

192
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,875
Okay, he's going to die 3 times tomorrow, right, Jameson?

193
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,304
I promise.

194
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,009
Well, inspector, what is this all about?

195
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,333
- Well, a robbery has been committed. - Jewelry?

196
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:44,178
No, but they broke into a safe between 1 and 2 pm this afternoon.

197
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,667
- And why are you looking for me? - I thought maybe you could help us.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,282
Thanks.

199
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,940
I'm afraid you'll have to come with us to the police station, Lanyard.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,975
why?

201
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:00,815
A cigarette like this was found on the floor in front of the safe.

202
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:05,076
- Oh, no, really, Inspector? - I know it seems placed there on purpose.

203
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,074
But aren't these cigarettes made especially for you?

204
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,700
For me and Carole Lombard, have you seen her?

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,072
No, but we didn't like it.

206
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,274
Now ... silver.

207
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,389
So, would you like to know where I was between 1 and 2 am?

208
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,552
Inspector, I have one of the most beautiful libis you've ever heard. She is...

209
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:26,357
Between.

210
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,590
Gentlemen, I thought you might be thirsty.

211
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,451
- Yeah, it's not a bad idea. - Let's hear it, Lanyard.

212
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,621
I don't want to interrupt, but...

213
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,170
I pushed her away for a while.

214
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,045
And that libi?

215
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,295
At 1:00, Inspector, I was having lunch...

216
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,888
...with a young woman at the Playmouth Hotel.

217
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,610
- Pleased? - What is this girl's name?

218
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,968
Marie Templeton.

219
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:20,274
You mean the blonde singer who's on Duke Jones August II?

220
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,473
- Yeah. - Oh, boy, is she...

221
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,364
Just a moment.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,531
You will leave.

223
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,750
Miss Carson doesn't know about the other girl, huh?

224
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,070
I'd rather go to jail, Inspector.

225
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,142
Are you sure you had lunch with Marie Templeton?

226
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:54,140
Of course, we're both interested in antiques.

227
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:57,505
I have a great collection and we came later to admire it.

228
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,531
Okay, Lanyard, let's check this out with Ms. Templeton,

229
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:02,750
But remember that this story does not hold up.

230
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,742
I know. I'll try better ones.

231
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,746
But don't worry, I'll be quiet here.

232
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,113
- And now, Inspector, how about a drink? - No, thanks. We have to go.

233
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,478
Ol�, Val. What's the hurry?

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,635
By the way, where does your... �libi live?

235
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,100
No hotel Playmouth.

236
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,525
Come back anytime, gentlemen.

237
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,900
Maybe after we talk to this blonde.

238
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,236
Come on, Jenks.

239
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,600
- Funny, isn't it? - Yes, very funny.

240
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,560
- A blonde, isn't it? Dirty traitor! - Okay, calm down.

241
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,240
- The whole family should go to jail. -Let's just focus on Lanyard.

242
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,625
Okay, where do we start? To the hotel in Playmouth?

243
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:05,925
no. To the police station.

244
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:08,215
Wait a moment. Aren't we going to see Marie?

245
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,788
Maybe later. He's too smart to lie about her.

246
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:13,401
First let's check that no one except Lanyard smokes these cigarettes.

247
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:14,386
for what?

248
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,520
Lanyard somehow got involved in this and I'm going to find out how and where.

249
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,805
I still think we should go see Marie first.

250
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,420
It's strange that they found one of my cigarettes.

251
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:29,085
I don't care about cigarettes, what about that blonde?

252
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,240
You invited yourself to lunch with me.

253
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,580
- Yes, but... - I didn't have a date with you, right?

254
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:36,075
- No. - Well, I had a date with the girl.

255
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,420
She has a friend who could buy one of my antiques.

256
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,100
Why didn't you tell me right away?

257
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:41,445
I thought you wouldn't believe me.

258
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:44,125
And I don't believe it. Could you take me to lunch?

259
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,900
- It's too late. - I'll settle for dinner.

260
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:49,338
- A few cocktails and a deal. - All right.

261
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,300
- Is that a distraction? - No, I really need a drink.

262
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,575
- I won't have to pay? - I promise.

263
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,890
Okay, this time no blondes.

264
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,640
Not everyone is here. Three pages disappeared.

265
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,000
That's all there was in the vault, boss.

266
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,751
Palmer must have the missing plans in his lab.

267
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,304
Yes Yes! Didn't they? Are you sure?

268
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,016
Okay, it's fine.

269
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,961
- The police did not arrest Lanyard. - Those phony cops!

270
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,855
No, wait a moment. Maybe it's better this way.

271
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,192
- I wonder... - Are you glad they didn't arrest Lanyard?

272
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,450
Yes, the Lone Wolf will lead us to the missing planes...

273
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:51,532
... from Palmer's laboratory.

274
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,055
And this time we'll have enough evidence to hold him for life.

275
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,460
- I am really sorry. - No way.

276
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,785
- Love is... So wonderful. -Yea!

277
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
It's fine. Her name is Marie Templeton.

278
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,000
She is also a very intelligent woman and is interested in my antiques.

279
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,692
If I had a knife, I'd cut your throat from ear to ear.

280
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,800
- Sir? - Two cocktails... and a knife.

281
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,210
I don't understand why the police suspect you.

282
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:38,240
- For crime - Are you serious, Mike?

283
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,410
The crime is serious, but I didn't do it.

284
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,970
- Of course you can prove it. - Of course I have a witness.

285
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,893
- Oh, that blonde. - Miss Templeton.

286
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,850
I had to have lunch with her.

287
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:52,025
What you mean? Run after all the blondes in Washington.

288
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,913
You are blonde.

289
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:55,450
It's just my hair. I'm actually a brunette.

290
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,310
- Oh I see. - Men marry brunettes.

291
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,369
I still prefer blondes.

292
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,610
Mike... Voc� me ama, n�o �?

293
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,408
- You know I do. - Do you swear?

294
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,595
Interest.

295
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,963
Let's get married. We will be incredibly happy.

296
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:24,644
For a while perhaps, then we'd be wrong.

297
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,975
- And you are very young. - Not so young.

298
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,734
I'm an old man, in winter my joints ache.

299
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,860
Also, we would have to live on a dirty farm.

300
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:41,445
We could go to Bermuda in winter, or to Egypt. What do you think of Egypt?

301
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,870
- H? No, it's too cold. - Very cold?

302
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,475
- Very cold... - Huh?

303
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,750
- Who is she? - Who?

304
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,575
The woman you can't take your eyes off of.

305
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,532
Which woman? Oh... that woman.

306
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,355
- I don't know. - Of course not.

307
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:06,250
I've never seen her in my entire life.

308
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,436
- You lie, you liar. -Word of honor. I've never seen her before.

309
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,520
You know I would never forget... a face.

310
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,060
Michael, my dear, how wonderful!

311
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,457
- You... never forget a face! - Do you want to sit down?

312
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,782
Michael, honey, are you faking it?

313
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,729
I thought you had forgotten about me.

314
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,965
- Karen. - This is Miss Carson.

315
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,370
- How is it going? - How is it going?

316
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,200
How could you have forgotten me, dear?

317
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,550
We had such a good time that winter in Budapest.

318
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,210
Budapest?

319
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,890
- Do you remember Daníbio? - Liar...

320
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,270
Did the police question you about the theft at the Royal Palace?

321
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,350
Theft?

322
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,115
They knew it was the work of the Lone Wolf.

323
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,845
Of course they didn't know what I knew.

324
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,345
And what did you know?

325
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,071
That Michael Lanyard and the Lone Wolf are the same person.

326
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,665
- Do you remember? - Now I begin to remember.

327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,920
I'd like to talk to him about the good old days.

328
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,740
I'm glad you say so.

329
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:14,635
I was afraid you'd think I'd come to your table for another reason.

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,180
- Not at all. - I need your advice...

331
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,323
- ...if you don't have any problems. - Of course not!

332
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,365
- Ei! - Neg�cios, Val.

333
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,800
- Bullshit business! - Goodbye, Miss. Carson.

334
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,120
At� but, Val.

335
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,865
- Mike! Mike! - A conta, Srta....

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,900
You know, I'm terribly disappointed in you.

337
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:41,800
- J? - It was very easy.

338
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,178
- What? - Make you come with me.

339
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,477
That absurd story about Budapest.

340
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,486
- Not even a child would have believed it. -I didn't believe it.

341
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,735
So why did you come?

342
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,510
Is there a connection between you and the nasty people I met last night?

343
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,730
- And if so? - I want to talk to them about cigarettes.

344
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,905
cigarettes?

345
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,993
Yes, they are very careful when they leave mine around.

346
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,082
- He did that? - Shall we go and see him?

347
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,451
- No. - So, where are we going?

348
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,180
- To Angus Palmer's Laboratory. - For what?

349
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,435
- To open a safe. -Oh, no! I don't like safes.

350
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:18,460
Of course it will, my friend.

351
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,150
Why, I was hoping to see you. Your friends are very nasty.

352
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:39,440
Forget it smartass and do it fast. The guards will appear soon.

353
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,059
What did he mean by guards?

354
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:44,100
The men sent by Mr. Palmer have their days numbered.

355
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,520
- Do they force you to follow orders? - Yea.

356
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,225
Very smart.

357
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,432
Here it is.

358
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,443
You cannot leave.

359
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,445
The cabinet is surrounded by an electric fence.

360
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:01,533
A very smart man, Mr. Palmer.

361
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,910
Come on, don't waste time.

362
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,469
The locks are locked. What about?

363
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,050
Well, I'll have to release them.

364
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,875
The fuses.

365
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,545
Black powder. How considerate.

366
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,075
- Lit up. - For what?

367
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,200
- Here, you open the safe. - It's fine.

368
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,030
- Palmer thought of everything. - Yea.

369
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,665
- What are you going to do? - Professional secrecy.

370
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,815
Now everyone back. It may be dangerous.

371
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That cheap little trick?

372
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,015
The gas expands very peculiar properties.

373
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,500
He can't go out. Call your men.

374
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,000
He ran away, come on!

375
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,551
- How clumsy you are, friend. - We said you couldn't escape.

376
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,895
Get back to work, smartass.

377
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,500
-What happens if I can't open it? - Come on, start!

378
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,830
- And no tricks. - Open the safe.

379
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,846
Thanks.

380
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,560
A cigarette.

381
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:12,877
You think of everything, don't you?

382
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,040
The cigarette...

383
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,566
- ...my fingerprints and no libi. - Now close the safe, Mr. Lanyard.

384
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,475
- Anything else I can do for you? - No.

385
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:34,107
I think you've done enough. You can go home.

386
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,880
Alone? No escort? No sale?

387
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:41,857
Alone.

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,700
He won't be smart when the police catch him.

389
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,190
Oh Jameson, I don't like shooting you and you don't die.

390
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,660
No, Miss Patricia, I'm too busy to die.

391
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,115
Please, just once, just like you did yesterday.

392
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,495
I promise not to ask you again.

393
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,450
- Won't I have to die again tomorrow? - No, I promise.

394
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,830
Alright, as soon as I'm done with this.

395
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,700
- Mr. Lanyard?... Ohh! - Ohh! Who are you?

396
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,550
Voc� � Marie Templeton, n�o �?

397
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:39,020
- How do you know? - It doesn't matter.

398
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,700
Between.

399
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,100
- Tell me, did you have a good lunch? - Oh yeah.

400
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,895
Splendid, that's great.

401
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,658
Sit down.

402
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,200
- What's that for? - Sshh! The West End Gang.

403
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,067
Is Mr Lanyard here?

404
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,200
- You came to see the antiques, right? - Yes, how do you know?

405
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,873
That's what all the girls say.

406
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:14,448
- Has he kissed you? - Who? Mr Lanyard?

407
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,368
He always behaved like a perfect gentleman.

408
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,115
Knight? H, that's what you think!

409
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,431
Have you heard about the Sioux City Killer?

410
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,300
- Is he the...? - Shhh! It's just one of them.

411
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,540
Release!

412
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,860
- Veneno. - Ooh!

413
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:41,580
- It's not too late to run away. - No?

414
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:44,520
- No. - How do you know so much?

415
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,420
I've been in your power for five long years.

416
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,160
- And why don't you escape? - I can't.

417
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,005
His gang, they're all killers, but he's the worst.

418
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,559
- He's such an attractive man. - That's precisely the problem.

419
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,110
- Do you know who Mata-Hari was? - The spy?

420
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:05,334
- She was his first victim. - Oh, horrible...

421
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,190
Oh, but that was a long time ago.

422
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:15,148
Yes, but then it was... Sonia, Paulette... She committed suicide.

423
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:22,045
- He married all these women? -Let's see... with 8 since I've been here.

424
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,015
- Eight? - That's just the last 5 years.

425
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,450
- Did he divorce them? - Divorce... him?

426
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,960
- He quartered them. - Ohh!

427
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,325
I love that rug and I see it ruining it.

428
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,795
- That'll give you an idea. - Al�, Marie!

429
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,725
- Where were you? - Stealing a safe.

430
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,835
Ohh! You bastard!

431
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,850
- What's with her? - Are you worried about her?

432
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,250
- What's with this provocative woman? - Just business.

433
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,670
I don't expect to hear anything good, but I want you to tell me.

434
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,100
Pay the bill.

435
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,930
- I thought we only ordered one. - Well, I had to drown my sorrows.

436
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,710
- Good evening, Senator Carson. - Goodnight.

437
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,405
- Hello, Senator. - Hello Mike.

438
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,516
- Hey, darling. - Hey, dear.

439
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,940
Ol�!

440
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,290
-Mike, I have to talk to you... as. - Sure, come in.

441
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,080
Listen, I want to know what's going on here.

442
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,930
Mike, don't do this, I warn you! Mike! Mike!

443
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,482
Well, what brings you here, senator?

444
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,350
Mike, you got me in a tight spot.

445
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,893
Today at noon someone broke into the safe of the Ministry of War...

446
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:59,592
...and stole part of Palmer's anti-aircraft missile plans.

447
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,933
- Part of the plans? - Yea.

448
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,110
Fortunately, the codes are in Palmer's lab.

449
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,057
Any idea who did this?

450
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:12,705
The consensus seems to be that you did.

451
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,808
In fact, the police believe this too.

452
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,420
- Do you believe? - Yea.

453
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:21,475
- They even took the dogs. - V�?... in what grip does this leave me?

454
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,350
I understand!

455
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:26,620
The senator's daughter has fallen in love with an international spy.

456
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:32,539
Mike, this is not funny! The police are convinced it was you.

457
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,129
Wait until they know what happened to Palmer's safe.

458
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,100
- What happened to Palmer's safe? - I had to break into it.

459
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,242
They forced me to do this, you know?

460
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,175
It's all part of a sinister plan.

461
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,430
A mysterious woman, armed men on vacation in the country?

462
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,210
All of this is very exciting.

463
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,860
Mike!

464
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,980
- Hi, Val! - Let me in, will you?

465
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,975
Alright, I'm coming down!

466
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:17,066
Those mysterious gentlemen I told you about try to frame me.

467
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,615
And will they come here for the rest of the plans?

468
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,492
- No doubt, but you won't find them. - Why not?

469
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:24,475
Because I'm going to give them to you.

470
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,700
To me? Oh no, not that.

471
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,825
I just want you to stay with them tonight.

472
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:30,175
And what's good about it?

473
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,957
It's my only chance for anyone to believe this fantastic story.

474
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,075
And then I will return all plans to the War Ministry.

475
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,076
But, if you don't have any plans.

476
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,475
I plan to get the rest of the plans tonight.

477
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,000
- Like? - The girl with the plans...

478
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:47,990
... Her name is Karen.

479
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,395
That was a dirty trick.

480
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,475
What did you expect to find in the men's room?

481
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:00,795
Last time he showered with his clothes on.

482
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,250
It should be more systematic.

483
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,473
- Senator! - Yea?

484
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:10,065
You know, there's an envelope you'll find in the inside pocket of my jacket.

485
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,149
Oh yeah. I have to go.

486
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:18,500
Are you going to Gregory's party?

487
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,435
Mike, are we going to Gregory's party?

488
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:22,072
Gregory? Who is?

489
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,130
He's a millionaire from Baltimore.

490
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,626
Now he is the darling of high society.

491
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,370
Throw a fancy dress party.

492
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,360
Parties are not for me.

493
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,980
I have things to do.

494
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,090
He's getting older for certain things.

495
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:37,475
No, what he has to do is very important.

496
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,040
Important to all of us.

497
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,173
- Well... good luck. - Goodnight.

498
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,590
What are you and my father planning?

499
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,375
- Nothing that interests you. - Looks like I'm interested now.

500
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,960
What happened after you left me there?

501
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:53,005
- Not what you imagine. - I don't believe you.

502
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,323
- It's true. I don't like this girl. - Same?

503
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,100
- I have to see her again. - I knew. why?

504
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,500
Because she has something the police think I stole.

505
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:03,565
Oh, you'll have to think of a better story than that.

506
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,320
Do you know why it looks so bad?

507
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,755
Because it's the truth.

508
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,343
I think that's right.

509
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:10,157
You're too smart to make up that ridiculous story.

510
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:11,742
You make me laugh.

511
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,523
- Well, I'll find out. - See this?

512
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,033
I stole it from Palmer's lab this afternoon.

513
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:20,240
I'll find out where you bought it. I'm smart, aren't I?

514
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,820
You can buy hundreds of these in Washington.

515
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:27,575
That's the question. My only chance is for someone at the hotel to tell me which one.

516
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,805
Well come out, I have to get dressed.

517
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,450
- We got him, Mr. Gregory. - Splendid, James!

518
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,575
What's up? What does that mean?

519
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,775
You already have my plans, what more do you want from me?

520
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,510
Your silence, Mr. Palmer.

521
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:45,085
If he were free, it would be natural for him to duplicate the plans.

522
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,125
But you can't keep me here indefinitely!

523
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:53,920
Correct, Mr. Palmer, I cannot. You will embark on a journey, a long journey.

524
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,071
- Where are the plans? - Here.

525
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,815
No problem, I believe.

526
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,400
Nothing important. Lanyard tried to escape once.

527
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,570
It's a pity. She should go to jail.

528
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,055
Jenks, you are an idiot. Lanyard tricked him.

529
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,344
These are not Palmer's plans.

530
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,050
- Do you know where Lanyard lives? - Yea.

531
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,340
By the way, do you know what will happen to you if you come back without plans, Jenks?

532
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:31,658
Sim.

533
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,600
There's been a slight change in our plans, Mr. Palmer.

534
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:41,442
Your trip will be delayed for a while.

535
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,850
Take it down, gentlemen.

536
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,893
Two very dry Martins.

537
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:49,822
And a fence to keep the blondes out.

538
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,840
Wait a moment.

539
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,287
Do you know the lady who came to our table this afternoon?

540
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:58,099
The one who rolled, do you know her?

541
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:01,950
- Ah yes! The lady who spoke to you? - Yea.

542
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:03,940
The one with the gold dress and brown fur coat?

543
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,300
- Yes very pretty?

544
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:07,175
- That's right. - Did she wear a veil?

545
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,684
- Yes. - Who is she?

546
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,341
I don't know.

547
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,967
Does she come here often?

548
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:19,479
Maybe two or three times, always with Gregory the millionaire.

549
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,811
Thank you sir.

550
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,384
Gregory, hein?

551
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,290
And the drinks?

552
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,992
Sorry, I don't have time. I'm very busy tonight.

553
00:35:38,993 --> 00:35:41,799
- What are you going to do, Mike? - I'm still not sure.

554
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,470
- So, where are we going? - Home.

555
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:47,775
Home, nothing. We could go to Gregory's party.

556
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,475
This time I will stay close to you.

557
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,600
I'm not going to Gregory's party. I don't have an invite.

558
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:54,809
It doesn't matter. I will stay with you.

559
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,907
To the White House.

560
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,305
Sorry, he didn't give me any information.

561
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,730
He said he would be back very late.

562
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,045
Very well, sir. All right, Miss. Patricia, you...

563
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,500
- What is this? - Don't worry.

564
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:02,781
I've been here for an hour and I've seen things I haven't seen since my last hangover.

565
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,075
I completely forgot. It's a surrealist party.

566
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,678
Surreal, huh? I can define it with better words than that.

567
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,031
I will wait for you here. Mr Fenton.

568
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,950
- Ol�. - Ol�!

569
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:40,470
- Excuse me, can you read this? - Yea.

570
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:44,588
Let's see, is this the number 6666 here?

571
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:48,221
- Yes. - Oh, and what's your fantasy?

572
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,775
I'm dressed as a virgin forest. And you?

573
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,765
Look! Midnight... here we go!

574
00:37:57,431 --> 00:38:00,460
What's the problem? Missed something?

575
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,001
Hey... wait a minute, buddy.

576
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,342
How are you with my hat?

577
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,035
Your invitation, sir. Dr. Roger Beachams.

578
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,295
Sr. Charles Fenton.

579
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,515
- Wait a minute, Charlie Fenton? - Yea.

580
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,705
- Are you sure? - Yea.

581
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,401
What a curious thing.

582
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,680
- Charlie Fenton from the October Club? - Yea.

583
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,125
- Are you really sure? - Yea.

584
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,426
OH...This is very strange.

585
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,875
I thought I was Charlie Fenton from the October Club.

586
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:52,500
There may be two Charlie Fentons in the October Club.

587
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:56,340
This is impossible. I should know if I live with myself.

588
00:38:56,341 --> 00:38:56,950
Oh.

589
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:01,624
Wait a moment. I have to clarify this.

590
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,375
Voc� � Charlie Fenton... Eu n�o sou Charlie Fenton.

591
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,240
- Who I am? - I don't know.

592
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,685
Well I have to be somebody! Or not?

593
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,575
Why don't you ask the policeman?

594
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,965
Oh, it's a great idea. And I not knowing.

595
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,410
They always take me home.

596
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,910
Well, officially!

597
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,292
The top is closed. The party is over there.

598
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:39,561
Thanks.

599
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,929
Oh wow!

600
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,650
Don't worry. Everyone is losing their minds tonight.

601
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:03,975
- I go whiskey to stay in tune. - I serve you.

602
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,208
You know, this is what I like most about my profession.

603
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:08,451
I never felt like drinking on the job.

604
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,009
- With soda? - Yes thanks.

605
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,195
- Here it is, sir. Thanks.

606
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,140
- I'll be right back. - Why?

607
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,252
- I... I think you dropped that. - It's you!

608
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,900
- Aren't you surprised to see me here? - No.

609
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,015
- Not even after this afternoon? - I had to see you.

610
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,360
- I haven't been impressed like this in years. - So you liked me, didn't you?

611
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,452
- Very. - More than that other girl?

612
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,800
Val Carson? I like you differently.

613
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:25,395
- You're a fool, aren't you? - Yea.

614
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,315
- Too silly? - Very.

615
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,500
- Now who's the fool? - Ha, ha.

616
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,515
- What does �ha, ha� mean? - Well... ha, ha.

617
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,102
I knew it was you all along.

618
00:41:48,115 --> 00:41:50,781
I knew nothing. You are a perfect liar.

619
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,560
I thought you said you didn't like her.

620
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,150
- Well... I don't like... - Oh, no.

621
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,810
"It's very nice." '"I like you differently."

622
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,409
- What I said was a lie. - You said I was a fool.

623
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,900
- And you are. - I guess so.

624
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,256
I'm starting to believe you again.

625
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,310
- Are you sure you like me? - With all my heart.

626
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,160
- I did want to lift it up or walk on top. - Or what?

627
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,915
Gregory is here somewhere.

628
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,975
- Why don't you follow him? - There is a guard on the stairs.

629
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,500
- You can help me. - What do I do?

630
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:24,890
- Go to the dance floor and scream. - Shout out?

631
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:28,182
Yes. Scream as loud as you can. We will.

632
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,378
- What's the problem? - Problem?

633
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,676
- You screamed. - Oh, it was nothing.

634
00:43:25,755 --> 00:43:27,466
� or anti-theft alarm.

635
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:08,049
- Probably a short circuit. - I'm not so sure.

636
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,500
- What's up? - Something with the anti-theft alarm.

637
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:32,101
- Gregory said to stay close. - It's fine.

638
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:07,192
Do you see anything interesting in this painting, Mr. Lanyard?

639
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,980
Well if not my old friend.

640
00:45:15,985 --> 00:45:19,020
I hope I didn't interrupt your investigation in my office.

641
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,385
In fact, you interrupted.

642
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,275
Well...until another day...maybe.

643
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,139
- Yea? - Got them, boss. It's in my pocket.

644
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,200
Yes. Lanyard gave them to Senator Carson for safekeeping.

645
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,035
Splendid, James! Now come back here immediately.

646
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,635
Gregory, your friends are starting to seriously piss me off.

647
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,375
- We won't irritate you much longer. - I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Lanyard.

648
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,272
-You will leave the country by air. - Let's help you breathe well.

649
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,375
- You are making a big mistake. - Why?

650
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,248
Because I have half the plans. If you kill me, you'll never have them.

651
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,928
This is not a problem that should concern you, Mr. Lanyard.

652
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,529
Take him out the back exit, boys.

653
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,980
- Hello, "Midnight". - Hello!

654
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,267
- That's the man! - The gentleman says you are an imposter.

655
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:27,055
- Yea? - Answer a question.

656
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,435
- Why not? proceed.

657
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:31,375
Okay, okay. I'm just going to ask you one question.

658
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,920
No one except Charlie Fenton knows the answer.

659
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,455
- Are you ready? - Yea.

660
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:38,668
Well...

661
00:46:39,457 --> 00:46:40,910
-... I forgot.

662
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:47,935
No, wait, here you go. Let's see, your wife's name is Pearl?

663
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,375
- Yea! - Ok, I give up.

664
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,536
- Sorry to bother you. - It was nothing.

665
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,925
- You have to take him to a taxi. - All right, Mr. Fenton.

666
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,170
Now I know I have to "pull the car".

667
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,675
Good night, boys.

668
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,457
- Who are you, miss? - My name is Val Carson.

669
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,198
- Know anyone here? - Now I don't see anyone.

670
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,600
Oh, that's the man I came with. He will identify me.

671
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,450
Yuhuu, Mike! Yuhuu!

672
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,330
Ol�!

673
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:38,962
- Mike. - Do you know this woman?

674
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,280
- I've never seen her in my life. - What?

675
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,725
Don't worry, miss. Nobody seems to remember anybody.

676
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,695
- Who did this to you? - Some very bad people, sir.

677
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,540
- They seemed to be looking for something. - And they didn't find it?

678
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,540
No, sir, and they looked very angry too.

679
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,470
They wanted to know who had come here tonight.

680
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:21,860
- Did you tell them? - Yes sir.

681
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,665
I said that Miss Val and her father were the only ones who had come here.

682
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,221
With Senator Carson, Miss...

683
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:37,903
what? Same? I will go immediately.

684
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,934
- They were stolen again. - Who, sir?

685
00:48:42,028 --> 00:48:46,220
- My half of the plans. - I don't understand, sir.

686
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:47,860
Let's play with these people, Jameson.

687
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:50,260
It's called: "Treasure, treasure, who has the treasure?"

688
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,750
Sounds like a pretty tough game, sir.

689
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:54,180
Yes, that's right.

690
00:48:54,213 --> 00:48:57,676
- Won't you talk? Okay, tough guy. - We will!

691
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,740
Got to the end of the line. I will break your crest.

692
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:02,560
Try it. Gerry, give him his due.

693
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:07,335
Watch out, behind you! Next week: "The Red Weasels Attack.

694
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,675
I'm sorry, Mike. I used to listen to "The Red Weasels" with Mom.

695
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,590
For now I forgive you, young lady.

696
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,400
Grab some clothes, let's go places.

697
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:18,130
Oh? Oh my!

698
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,130
Let's get it out of here in case of unexpected visitors.

699
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:23,621
- The police, sir? - Police?

700
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:25,264
- They called, sir. - When?

701
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:27,425
- As soon as he left. - What did they want?

702
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,030
You, sir.

703
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,329
By the way, what happened to Ms. Carlson?

704
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,070
I left it at the party, in a hurry, I'm afraid.

705
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,218
- Why sir? - I had to leave her, Jameson.

706
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,500
I ran into a problem that I didn't want her involved in.

707
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,250
You already know that she... well... that means a lot to me.

708
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,079
- "Precious" is the word. - I'm afraid so.

709
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,277
Sometimes I wish I weren't so old, I could be her father.

710
00:49:57,302 --> 00:50:00,855
- Yes. - If you're in a hurry, leave a little early.

711
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,190
Oh, hope!

712
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,921
- Pour me a whiskey and soda. - Yes sir.

713
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,060
D�-me.

714
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,660
No, hold on tight.

715
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,686
Now hold it while I drink.

716
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:34,100
- Are you okay, sir? - Quite well.

717
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,010
You can leave it there.

718
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,813
Oh, leave all your fingerprints.

719
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,583
- Now, answer the bell. - If no one touched.

720
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,115
I want to talk with...

721
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,365
What is all this?

722
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:08,925
Just a routine robbery, inspector, nothing important.

723
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,600
- Ah yes? - I'll arrest you for theft, Lanyard.

724
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,750
Who did I steal this time? The Treasury Minister?

725
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:17,250
- No, he broke into Palmer's safe. - The inventor?

726
00:51:17,252 --> 00:51:20,275
Do you think I'm kidding? We found fingerprints on it.

727
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:21,405
And they think they're mine.

728
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,703
Need to be. We found another one of your cigarettes in front of the safe.

729
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:30,582
Waste your time, Inspector. You know I didn't do that job at the War Ministry.

730
00:51:30,607 --> 00:51:33,330
- How we know? - Didn't you talk to Marie Templeton?

731
00:51:33,335 --> 00:51:35,605
- Yeah, we talked to her. - And then?

732
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:37,348
She never heard of you.

733
00:51:37,373 --> 00:51:40,525
This is one of the happiest moments of my life, Lanyard.

734
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,587
- One moment, Inspector. - Miss Carson!

735
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:45,937
Lanyard couldn't be in the War Ministry.

736
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:48,475
- Why not? - Do I tell them, honey?

737
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:50,470
Of course...go on...

738
00:51:50,495 --> 00:51:51,965
Don't mind, Miss. Carson, after all...

739
00:51:51,966 --> 00:51:55,970
- Sra., Inspector, Sra. Lanyard. - Sra. Lanyard?

740
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,260
- Sra. Lanyard! - Sra. Lanyard!

741
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,817
Yes, we got married at 1:00 pm this afternoon.

742
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,740
Just as the safe was stolen, Inspector.

743
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,420
I think this is the worst case I've worked on.

744
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,500
Won't you congratulate us?

745
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,100
- Sure. Congratulations, Ms. Lanyard. - Thanks.

746
00:52:11,101 --> 00:52:14,214
Felici... Doesn't look very happy to me.

747
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,540
- I am really happy. - Should be.

748
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,668
Now all you have to do is explain your fingerprints on Palmer's safe.

749
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:24,750
- You still don't know if it's my fingerprints. - We'll find out soon enough.

750
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,100
You can't collect my fingerprints if I'm not arrested. I know my rights.

751
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,915
Ok, so let's have it turned on.

752
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,542
- On my wedding night? Oh! - You wouldn't do that, Inspector.

753
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,055
Jameson, get me a cold drink.

754
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:44,215
Don't touch that cup! Take this, Devon.

755
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,640
Do you think we're idiots?

756
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,542
It looks like his name is written all over Palmer's chest.

757
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,260
- Here you are, Devon. Check the fingerprints. - Just a moment.

758
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,629
- Checked. We are not of the same subject. - Like?

759
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,275
Anyway, he will come with us.

760
00:53:08,276 --> 00:53:10,162
It feels good to arrest a man for a crime,

761
00:53:10,163 --> 00:53:12,075
...even if your fingerprints don't match.

762
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,425
This is the worst case I've worked on.

763
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,705
Well, looks like you've saved yourself again, Lanyard.

764
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,650
You're somehow involved in this case, and I'm going to find out how.

765
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,818
You can bet on it.

766
00:53:20,843 --> 00:53:22,772
I will check if your license has expired.

767
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,039
- If you weren't married... - Inspector!

768
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,840
Good night, inspector. Good night, sergeant.

769
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,790
What's good about her?

770
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,600
In my 15 years in the police...

771
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,805
- Are you really a police officer? - Yea.

772
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,665
- Really? - Yes, really.

773
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,985
- That's thinking fast. - It wasn't like that, dear.

774
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,600
- Sorry I left you at the party. - All right.

775
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:02,675
- Aren't you angry? - No, I understand.

776
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,990
I fear that if I had gone with you it would have been worse.

777
00:54:05,015 --> 00:54:06,078
You're right.

778
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,000
- Mike, honey. - What?

779
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,970
I didn't know I was so precious to you.

780
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,980
So you heard me talking to Jameson, right?

781
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,446
You are not old enough to be my father.

782
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,481
Listening behind doors. Another vice that will have to be corrected,

783
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,410
...beyond drunkenness.

784
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,415
- Mike. - What?

785
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,280
- This is serious. - Of course yes.

786
00:54:26,418 --> 00:54:28,200
I almost ended up married.

787
00:54:28,205 --> 00:54:31,575
No, silly. I did this to save your neck. You were in trouble.

788
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,950
You don't even know half of them, which reminds me that...

789
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:35,625
- ...we have to get out of here. - Why?

790
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,550
I expect very unpleasant people.

791
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:39,365
- What is all this, Mike? - I'll tell you later.

792
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:41,815
I'll take you and Pat to your house, where you'll be safe.

793
00:54:41,816 --> 00:54:43,871
I don't want to be safe, I just want to be with you.

794
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:45,175
I'll let Pat.

795
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,168
Mr Lanyard!

796
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,510
Look.

797
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,291
We have to get out of here.

798
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,964
All down.

799
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,180
There's a car there.

800
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,320
It's what I was looking for.

801
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:50,511
- Did you see that, sergeant? - Drink your coffee.

802
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,500
- That guy again, sergeant! - Shut up!

803
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,226
This starts to irritate me.

804
00:56:11,628 --> 00:56:13,721
Damn cops, are you sleeping or what?

805
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,050
Next time throw this out the window to see if they wake up.

806
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:18,085
It will be a pleasure.

807
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,050
Wow, I'm getting dizzy!

808
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,285
Let's go!

809
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,545
Hit the target!

810
00:56:35,546 --> 00:56:38,500
- Was it that guy again? - Now he irritated you enough?

811
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:39,820
Silence! Let's go!

812
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,305
- Good luck, he escaped! - Shut up!

813
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,835
Here he comes, sergeant!

814
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,415
What do you think we should do now, Sergeant?

815
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:02,193
Get on the road!

816
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,051
It worked better than I expected.

817
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,734
- It was fun, wasn't it? - Very fun.

818
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,355
- Mike, let's do it again? - Go to bed.

819
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,943
Ah, Mike.

820
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,935
- Where do you come from? - What happened to you?

821
00:57:17,936 --> 00:57:18,856
Who made this?

822
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:21,435
That? The same guy who took the plans.

823
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,145
That guy in the gray hat?

824
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,590
I think so. He looked republican.

825
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,985
I know him. All the more reason to go after him.

826
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,915
We played police and bandit. It was very funny!

827
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,635
It's time for you to lie down.

828
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,570
Very good. Now Patricia come up, yes sir.

829
00:57:35,576 --> 00:57:37,786
The "Red Weasels" come after us.

830
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,310
Come on, little pest.

831
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,200
Sorry, Senator, I didn't mean to get you involved in this mess.

832
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,750
forget it. I haven't had this much fun since I was in administration.

833
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,422
- It's not for that, daddy. - But what's up?

834
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,610
- More trouble? - Well, you could say yes.

835
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,560
Mike breaks into safes, Jameson gets hit in the head and...

836
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:57,270
...told the police that Mike and I got married.

837
00:57:57,271 --> 00:58:00,345
- Married? with you? - Not yet.

838
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,885
We just hit a police car.

839
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,525
What it does is improve your criminal history.

840
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,995
- Pat! - Ol�!

841
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,425
Get out of there.

842
00:58:17,548 --> 00:58:21,183
I thought I told you to go to bed.

843
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,100
Well, where are we going now?

844
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:27,225
You're not going anywhere, but I'll get the rest of the plans.

845
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,811
- I'm going too. - No, you won't.

846
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,900
You are very tired. Need to rest.

847
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,400
I'll go with you, Mike.

848
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,215
Mike! Those men are here again.

849
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,308
what?

850
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,360
- Now go to bed. - Oh, hell!

851
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,991
- I'll miss all the fun. - C'mon C'mon.

852
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,960
Let them in.

853
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,200
It's Karen and the man who hit you, Joe.

854
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,336
I will too.

855
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,491
Mike, let me deal with this provocative woman, will you?

856
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:10,600
Oh, n�o.

857
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:14,690
If you try any of your tricks, I'll slit their throats.

858
00:59:15,315 --> 00:59:17,807
Yes sir. Please enter.

859
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,380
I'll tell Mr. Lanyard you're here, sir.

860
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:28,616
- No way. - Jameson, why did you do that?

861
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,038
An eye for an eye, sir.

862
00:59:31,507 --> 00:59:34,771
- I'm already quite satisfied, sir. - Oh.

863
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:43,179
- The people have arrived, sir. - Tell them to come in.

864
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,179
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

865
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:48,351
I want to speak with Mr. Lanyard as well.

866
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,429
I hope you know what you're doing.

867
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,170
- I said as. - Yes, I heard her.

868
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,957
All right, I'm leaving.

869
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,648
Don't you want to sit down?

870
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,353
- Cigarettes? - No, not like that, thank you.

871
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,405
Mr. Lanyard, this game of hide and seek was a lot of fun.

872
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,100
- But it must end. - I am really sorry.

873
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,700
- I was starting to like it. - Conditions have changed.

874
01:00:33,725 --> 01:00:34,853
Same?

875
01:00:34,909 --> 01:00:38,358
We have to deliver Palmer's plans by dawn or we'll lose the sale.

876
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:40,070
And what does this have to do with me?

877
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,921
We want to make a deal with you.

878
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:44,900
I know, but this time no gimmicks.

879
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,715
Let's join our forces and share the benefits.

880
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,250
- I'm afraid I can't. - Why not?

881
01:00:51,346 --> 01:00:54,868
For starters, because I couldn't get my hands on my part of the plans...

882
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,037
...so quickly. Also, I don't like your friend Gregory.

883
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,084
You know... I was disappointed too.

884
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,725
Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

885
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:55,820
- Well... I'm sure. - Do you have to go so early?

886
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,263
Voc�! Voc�, Casanova!

887
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:07,495
- Excuse me. - Yea?

888
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,885
You were right, Jameson. Very satisfying.

889
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:17,265
Very much, sir.

890
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,500
- Fortunately I arrived in time. - Mr Lanyard!

891
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,072
Mr. Lanyard, Ms. Patricia is gone!

892
01:02:35,073 --> 01:02:36,295
- What? - Look!

893
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:41,500
Mike: I'm going to accompany this gang you...

894
01:02:41,501 --> 01:02:46,000
...wanted to find, know when I discover your hiding place. Pat (G-7)

895
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:47,651
Mike!

896
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,403
Give me 15 minutes and call Inspector Thomas.

897
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,607
Tell him to look for Pat and me at Gregory's.

898
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,845
Wait a minute.

899
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,915
- Hey! Who are you? - I'm the G-7.

900
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,987
- A detective. - Hello!

901
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,069
- Hello! - Lets go in.

902
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,085
I checked the marriage license office.

903
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:42,380
There are no marriage licenses with those names this year.

904
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:43,098
Are you sure?

905
01:03:43,123 --> 01:03:45,800
Of course yes. This guy is the office director and can confirm.

906
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:49,475
- Is it true? - Yes sir. It's true.

907
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,760
�timo.

908
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,375
Send a general alarm to Michael Lanyard,

909
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,630
-... age, 35 years old. - Dark hair and mustache.

910
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,125
He wears a tuxedo and has been seen in the company of a blonde woman.

911
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,245
Drives a yellow sports car.

912
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:05,392
Arrest him when you see him.

913
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,000
It's coming.

914
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,835
Hi, smart guy.

915
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,800
Inspector, you have to come with me.

916
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:32,100
All the police in Washington are looking for Lanyard.

917
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,800
It doesn't make sense that you can take me to him.

918
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:34,708
But I can.

919
01:04:34,709 --> 01:04:36,476
He's at Gregory's, Madison, 17.

920
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:38,905
Gregory is the man you are looking for. Michael told me to tell you.

921
01:04:38,906 --> 01:04:41,775
That's your answer. And he told you to tell me.

922
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,045
I'm not going anywhere that Lanyard says he is because it's...

923
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,775
...of course it's somewhere else, I know that.

924
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,912
Ma'am, you can't think the inspector is a fool.

925
01:04:47,914 --> 01:04:50,718
All right, I'll go alone. Someone will help me.

926
01:04:54,129 --> 01:04:55,904
This woman makes me dizzy!

927
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,933
Yes, we already have all the plans.

928
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,073
I think you already know what will happen to you.

929
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,785
- I can imagine. - If there's something you want...

930
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,741
...let's say... Your last order.

931
01:05:30,413 --> 01:05:32,621
I came here to see my little girl.

932
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,335
It is reasonable. Jenks, bring Mr. Lanyard's daughter.

933
01:06:00,872 --> 01:06:04,365
- Ol�, Valdy. - Ol�!

934
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:07,572
You'd better accompany me silently.

935
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,245
Will be happy to know we have another guest.

936
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,615
- Yea? - Miss. Carson decided to join them.

937
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:23,500
Let her go. She has nothing to do with it.

938
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:28,445
She will be fine. You don't have to worry about her.

939
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,695
This just arrived, Inspector.

940
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,184
Hey, Devon. They found Lanyard's car at 17 Madison.

941
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,380
All this is very strange.

942
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,376
We were sitting here while Ms. Carson told us where he was. We will!

943
01:06:44,276 --> 01:06:47,842
I'm sorry, Mike. I guess I'm not a good detective.

944
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:49,450
Come here, Pat.

945
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,605
Pat, I... I want to talk to you.

946
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:07,085
All right, Pat. Calm. cry. Now.

947
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,317
I'll have to take a long trip, Pat.

948
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,500
Be nice.

949
01:07:20,076 --> 01:07:22,811
There are some papers in the left desk drawer.

950
01:07:22,836 --> 01:07:25,855
I'll create a distraction, grab them and run.

951
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:33,081
Gotta be a good girl, Pat. Remember what I told you.

952
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,640
I will, daddy. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

953
01:07:50,715 --> 01:07:54,505
Gregory, promise Pat will be okay, will you?

954
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,500
I owed you that one!

955
01:08:58,466 --> 01:09:01,504
Mike! Mike! Here inside!

956
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:05,438
- OK! - Oh, Mike, good to see you!

957
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,600
This is Mr. Palmer. He...

958
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,545
There is no time. Let's get out of here.

959
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,785
Don't worry, honey. We'd better get out of here as soon as possible.

960
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:18,575
E Lanyard?

961
01:09:18,576 --> 01:09:20,843
Plans are most important right now.

962
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,785
Step aside. Leave it to me!

963
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,390
Try to get in, boys.

964
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,695
Sounds like the marines.

965
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,160
A pol�cia!

966
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:52,163
- Well if not my old friend Lanyard. - Inspector, just in time!

967
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,682
I would say yes.

968
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:58,318
If you get out of this, Lanyard... I'll eat my hat!

969
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:06,100
- Shall I bring you your hat, Inspector? - Bring me two.

970
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:08,500
Won't you need me anymore tonight, Inspector?

971
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:09,300
Who are you?

972
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,680
is the subject of the marriage license office.

973
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:14,300
- I never needed you! - Excuse me.

974
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,000
Would you like to issue a marriage license?

975
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:18,800
Yes, certainly. Of course yes!

976
01:10:18,801 --> 01:10:21,430
He's just the man I'm looking for. We're going to need you.

977
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,600
Come on, darling.

978
01:10:22,601 --> 01:10:26,020
- Inspector, arrest me without bail. - For what?

979
01:10:26,075 --> 01:10:28,996
I don't know, but I think I'll have something to confess to tomorrow morning.

980
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,255
- Take him, Devon. - It's fine.

981
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,817
Val, don't worry. I have the keys.
