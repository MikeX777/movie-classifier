1
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:24,645
It's as if I'm alone on a stranger planet

2
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,453
I have to go on living alone.

3
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,989
On this planet.

4
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,418
Alone.

5
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,754
3,000 yen.

6
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:18,329
But that's my engagement ring.

7
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,865
Then, 3,500 yen.

8
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:35,521
This happened because I depended on
somebody else for my happiness.

9
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:11,045
I'll never depend on anybody.
I won't believe in anybody.

10
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:18,822
I'm going to live alone. Alone. Alone.

11
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:27,030
Oh, no. I'm going to cry.

12
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:33,112
Come on, don't cry. Don't cry.

13
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,772
I'm not Ionely at all.

14
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,848
I'm going to live...

15
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,611
Alone?

16
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,385
You waiting for somebody?

17
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,757
Want to come over here?

18
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,665
Only if you want to.

19
00:03:55,935 --> 00:04:01,339
But things taste better
if you eat with others, right?

20
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,473
Are you sure?

21
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,701
Yeah. Of course it'll be on me.

22
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,435
I'd be glad to.

23
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:28,298
A STRANGER OF MINE

24
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,440
Miyata.

25
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,919
Yes?

26
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,952
I hear you live in
a pretty cool apartment.

27
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,754
Uh...Well...I guess...

28
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,396
Do me a favor.

29
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,899
Let me borrow your place tomorrow.

30
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,668
What?

31
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,274
I have a date.

32
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,910
She's 24 and a nurse.

33
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,977
Oh.

34
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,386
Let me use your place.

35
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,813
Come on. Only for 3, 4 hours.

36
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,088
Oh.

37
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:32,261
I want to be able to say,
"You want to see a movie at my place?"

38
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,897
You have a DVD, don't you?

39
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,831
No, I don't.

40
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,196
- A PlayStation 2?
- No.

41
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,802
Oh.

42
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,338
Oh, well. Anyway, I beg you.
I'll buy you dinner.

43
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,306
Well...

44
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,647
Okay? I'll come over tomorrow morning.

45
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,179
What? In the morning?

46
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,784
Yeah. She's working tonight
so we're dating at noon.

47
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,984
Draw me a map, OK?
I'll drive there. Thanks.

48
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,872
6,852 yen? Seriously?

49
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,915
Hello?

50
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,025
Hello? It's me.

51
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,719
Oh, Kanda. What's up?

52
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,160
Can you come out right now?
Let's have dinner.

53
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,535
Now? I just came home.

54
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,365
Then just come as you are. I'll buy.

55
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,803
Nah, I'm tired.

56
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,773
We need to talk.

57
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,180
Talk? Why are you whispering?

58
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,318
Uh...I'm working right now.

59
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,082
I'm tailing someone.

60
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,853
Then do yourjob.

61
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,192
When you finish, come over. I'll cook.

62
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,398
It's kind of important.
Come out right now. To the usual place.

63
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,557
What's so important?

64
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,068
It's about Ayumi.

65
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,920
"MIYATA TAKESHI"

66
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,030
Hey.

67
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,236
Don't "Hey" me. You're late.

68
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,739
Oh, sorry.

69
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,806
Have you ordered?

70
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,383
What is it?

71
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,444
What? Oh, yeah.

72
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,988
What?

73
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,321
Ayumi's getting married.

74
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,064
You met her?

75
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:31,427
Yeah. I ran into her today,
and we talked a bit.

76
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,203
She seemed well.

77
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,009
- Is that all?
- Huh?

78
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,111
- That's it?
- Yeah.

79
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,381
Excuse me!

80
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,159
Did she say anything about her stuff?

81
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,255
Her stuff?

82
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,294
Her stuff is still at my place.

83
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,736
Oh. Nope.

84
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,100
Throw it away.

85
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,639
I can't do that...

86
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:20,908
She asked me to send it
to her new address.

87
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:26,853
Listen, she dumped you and left.

88
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,823
She can't complain about it.

89
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,092
Throw it all away.

90
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:38,926
And throw that pitiful soggy
hope of yours away with it.

91
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,003
I'm not hopeful.

92
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,436
Really?

93
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,686
Did you call that girl the other day?

94
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,217
What girl?

95
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:04,590
That girl we had drinks with in Shinjuku.
With short hair.

96
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,496
Said her dad looked like Woody Allen.

97
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,223
Akemi.

98
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,095
Yeah, Akemi. Did you call her?

99
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,360
No.

100
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,437
Why not?

101
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,797
I don't know her number.

102
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,172
Why didn't you ask her?

103
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,703
You liked her. You said she was nice.

104
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,841
Well, there was no timing.

105
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,584
There is no timing!

106
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,252
You make your own timing!

107
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,757
Listen, you better take
phone numbers seriously.

108
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,529
Whether or not you know
that 11-digit number

109
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,539
separates total strangers
from acquaintances.

110
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:58,708
You threw away all possibility
because you "didn't have timing."

111
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,320
You should be devastated.

112
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,620
Let's go pick up girls.

113
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,323
Huh?

114
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,787
Pick up girls.

115
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,724
Coffee, please!

116
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,870
We're not kids in college.

117
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,505
We're going because we're not kids.

118
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,042
Don't be ridiculous. We're too old.

119
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,507
Then how're you gonna
meet girls from now on?

120
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,943
Huh?

121
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,156
You're still hopeful about life.

122
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,827
"lf I live a normal life,
someday I'll meet somebody."

123
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,890
"A gorgeous girl will appear."

124
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,263
"I can't be alone
for the rest of my life."

125
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,470
That's you. Just like a high school kid.

126
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,074
Listen. I'll make this clear.

127
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:09,777
Once you're over 30,
"Destined" or "Natural" encounters

128
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:15,255
or "Start as Friends and Gradually
Fall in Love" will never happen.

129
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,823
There are no more proms or homecomings.

130
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,564
If you don't do something,
you're going to stay Ionely.

131
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,073
Forever. I mean it.

132
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:35,241
You should be dreading
the impending crisis.

133
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,283
But we've never picked up girls before.

134
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,978
That requires...
well, talent and technique.

135
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,991
No, it doesn't.
You don't need technique to meet girls.

136
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,803
Alone?

137
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,005
You waiting for somebody?

138
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,505
Want to come over here?

139
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,773
Only if you want to.

140
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,681
But things taste better
if you eat with others, right?

141
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:17,548
Are you sure?

142
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,623
Yeah. Of course it'll be on me.

143
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,620
I'd be glad to.

144
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,937
Excuse me! The menu.

145
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,203
Right away.

146
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,072
What do you want?

147
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,391
This is Miyata Takeshi. I'm Kanda.

148
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,354
I'm Kuwata Maki.

149
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,757
Maki. Nice to meet you.

150
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,727
- Hello.
- Hello.

151
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,894
- The hamburger steak here is good.
- Oh, really?

152
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,869
- Huh?
- Oh, yes.

153
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,441
- You like hamburger?
- Oh, yes.

154
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,448
- I'm going to the toilet.
- Huh?

155
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,224
What's wrong?

156
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,388
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

157
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,331
- Are you finished?
- Oh, yes.

158
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,834
Um, do you want to order? A hamburger?

159
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:17,872
A hamburger.

160
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,808
- One hamburger steak set.
- Yes, right away.

161
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,981
- I'm sorry.
- No...

162
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:48,566
- Am I weird?
- No.

163
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,305
Huh?

164
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,893
Hello?

165
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,531
Where are you?

166
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,864
I'm...working.

167
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,704
Working? What about her?

168
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,437
Her? Do what you should.

169
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,842
What I should? What do you...

170
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,045
Look, I'm hanging up.
Good luck. It's your chance.

171
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,904
He's gone?

172
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,410
Yes. He went to work.

173
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:09,780
- At this hour?
- Yes.

174
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,928
I'm sorry.

175
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:25,333
He invited you over for me.

176
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:33,371
I mean...I recently... Well,
actually, about 6 months ago,

177
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,509
I broke up with my girlfriend.

178
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:43,115
And, well, it sort of
devastated me and...

179
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,186
I was pretty depressed...

180
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,093
He figured it would cheer me up
if I talked to a girl.

181
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,265
So he suddenly

182
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,865
struck up a conversation with you.

183
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,273
So, um... If you want to leave,
I understand.

184
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,016
Of course, the dinner's on me.

185
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:19,214
But I don't think he'll be coming back...

186
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,904
Where do you live?

187
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,203
I wonder if the train's still running?

188
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:45,576
- I don't live anywhere.
- Huh?

189
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:55,589
- Um...are you not interested in me?
- What?

190
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,757
Uh, sure, I'm interested in you.

191
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,793
I'm not very attractive, am I?

192
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:10,907
Uh...of course you're attractive.

193
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:17,181
I was engaged. Until yesterday.

194
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,980
I found a menthol cigarette butt.
With lipstick on it.

195
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,883
In his car. Not the ashtray.

196
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:34,087
It was between the
passenger seat and the door.

197
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,963
I found it.

198
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,861
Oh.

199
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,935
Menthol.

200
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,938
I wish I hadn't.

201
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:03,827
Um...do you like sweets?

202
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:13,237
I just remembered, this place has stuff
like cakes and nata de coco.

203
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,665
Yes. Shall we?

204
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,136
Yes.

205
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:28,610
Thank you... I'll have nata de coco...

206
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,953
Um...

207
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,726
You can cry, you know.

208
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,103
You can cry.

209
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,692
I'm sorry,
it's quite far from the station.

210
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:17,833
No. Um...are you sure it's not a problem?

211
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,560
Not at all.

212
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,608
In fact, I'm kind of glad.

213
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,178
Oh, I don't mean "glad" in a weird way.

214
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,753
You can sleep at my place
instead of a hotel.

215
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,154
Oh, by "sleep" I mean,
just sleep, sleep and stay over...

216
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,520
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

217
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,222
Yes. I'm alone, anyway...

218
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:53,093
Sometimes, that guy Kanda
drops by, but that's it.

219
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:58,535
- It's nice having a guest.
- Yes.

220
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:07,042
Oh, I don't do things
like this all the time.

221
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:10,949
Spending the night
with a man I just met...

222
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,719
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

223
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:27,765
Um...do you want a ride?
It's still some ways off.

224
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,840
Oh, then I'll drive.

225
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,078
Mr. Miyata, please get on.

226
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,613
- No, no.
- Please, please.

227
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,811
- I'm not sure...
- It's all right.

228
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,382
- Please.
- Well...

229
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,220
Hold on.

230
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,961
- Excuse me.
- Let's go!

231
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:58,560
- I'll drive.
- No. You're letting me stay...

232
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,899
And you bought me dinner...Oh!

233
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,981
I'll kill you!

234
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,883
"HANDYMAN YAMA-CHAN"

235
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,322
I'm sorry.

236
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,490
Uh, no... Are you OK?

237
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,831
I'm sorry.

238
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,765
- Let's walk.
- Yes.

239
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,651
- That was scary.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

240
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,193
It's all right.

241
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,215
- Please.
- Thank you.

242
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,520
Slippers, slippers.

243
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,858
Um, I don't have slippers.

244
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,794
That's no problem.

245
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,371
Excuse me.

246
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,720
Please use this room.

247
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,758
Yes, thank you.

248
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:09,256
- Do you have things to wear?
- Oh, yes.

249
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:15,705
- I'll sleep in the other room
- Oh, I see.

250
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,770
Will you take a bath?

251
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,469
Yes. I'm sorry.

252
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,447
No...

253
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:32,088
Um...I'm really sorry...

254
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,382
No...

255
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,229
This room is empty, anyway.

256
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,790
I mean, my old girlfriend...

257
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,930
Ayumi.

258
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,571
Yes.

259
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:57,104
We actually only lived
together for a week.

260
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,342
She left right after I bought this place.

261
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,684
Why?

262
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,283
Hmm?

263
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,885
Why did she leave?

264
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:18,736
She suddenly told me
she loved somebody else.

265
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:24,203
I hear she's getting married to that guy.

266
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,878
That's terrible.

267
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:34,585
Well...she couldn't help it.

268
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,113
She couldn't help it?

269
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,985
Yes, probably.

270
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,891
It's a matter of feelings.

271
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,134
We didn't sign a contract.

272
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:56,065
Do you still love her?

273
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,136
Yes, I do.

274
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,922
Anyway, please feel free to use this room.
You can think about...

275
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,566
I'm sorry.

276
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,504
No, it's all right.

277
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,772
I'll go get the bath ready.

278
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,498
Yes.

279
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,168
Um...Which bath salt do you want?

280
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:15,275
"Smooth Skin Beppu Spa" or "Hakone Spa"?

281
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,122
Excuse me.

282
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,796
I'm sorry. I know it's late.

283
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,361
How've you been?

284
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,607
- Can I come in?
- What? Now?

285
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:41,278
My stuff is still here. I came to get it.

286
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,705
Does it have to be now?

287
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:48,011
Yes. Not everything.
I just want to get what I need.

288
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,482
I'm sorry.

289
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,329
Oh, I'm really sorry.

290
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,867
I'll go right away.

291
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,837
Don't you think you're a bit selfish?

292
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,384
You betrayed him
and left without your stuff,

293
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,225
and now you're back go get it?

294
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,052
Do you only think of yourself?

295
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,458
Think about other people's feelings.

296
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,573
It's none of your business.

297
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,648
- I'll go now.
- What?

298
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,015
Thank you for everything.

299
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,847
Where are you going?

300
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,255
I'm sorry.

301
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,130
When you find what you need, leave.

302
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,133
I'll throw the rest away.

303
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,367
Good-bye.

304
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,202
You don't have anywhere
to go at this hour.

305
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,813
I'll stay in a hotel, so I'm fine.

306
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,684
But...

307
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,285
I think...

308
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:09,616
that I really shouldn't spend the night
with someone I just met.

309
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:18,867
And...I don't think she
just came to get her things.

310
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,066
What?

311
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,875
I mean, coming for
her stuff at this hour?

312
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,069
It's not natural.

313
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,278
She probably wants to talk to you.

314
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,954
Talk to me?

315
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,588
Maybe she came back.

316
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,232
That's what I think.

317
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,562
That can't be...

318
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,972
"That can't be true?" I don't think so.

319
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:04,712
Because a nice man like you...

320
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,283
I don't think is easy to forget.

321
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:16,284
Please just go home now.

322
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,631
You still love her, don't you?

323
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,442
No, I don't

324
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:41,141
But you said so before.

325
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:49,350
I loved her before, but I don't anymore.

326
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,872
Don't go.

327
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,113
Can it be anybody?

328
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:24,996
If you think she'll be yours,
you'll fall in love with anybody?

329
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,263
We just met.

330
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:36,337
You know nothing about me.
It's not right.

331
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,012
Thank you for today.

332
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,759
Watch out!

333
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,109
Your phone...

334
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,783
Give me your phone number.

335
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,187
My phone number?

336
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,592
Please.

337
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:46,562
I might never see you again...
for the rest of my life...

338
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:54,003
So please give me your phone number.

339
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,545
Since we did meet.

340
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,854
We just met.

341
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,760
I know nothing about you.

342
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,594
But I want to see you again.

343
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,340
Am I weird?

344
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,314
Give him your number.

345
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,726
Uh...Can I lie down?

346
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,355
Sure.

347
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:04,467
Your contract still has some days left over.
What will you do?

348
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,386
Oh, god...

349
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,118
"KANDA YUSUKE"

350
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,962
Hi, there.

351
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,699
Hi.

352
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,514
"KANDA DETECTIVE AGENCY"

353
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,850
Please?

354
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,104
I'll take black.

355
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,671
Oh, you want some, too?

356
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,247
No, forget it.

357
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:07,330
Is Miyata doing okay?

358
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,766
You want to know?

359
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,428
Sure.

360
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,767
Liar.

361
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:25,746
He bought that castle of an apartment,
so he's not doing great. The loan...

362
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:45,962
I developed them, but I can't give
them to him. He's devastated.

363
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:51,673
But compared to the others,
I suppose he's doing better.

364
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,068
What do you mean?

365
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,904
I checked up on you.

366
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,449
Because I heard you vanished.

367
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:05,513
I checked up on you
to discover where you were.

368
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:11,653
You were suspicious from the start.
I was curious about you.

369
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,995
I knew it.

370
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,138
You suspected me from the beginning.

371
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:29,913
You're 33 years old.
You were older than him.

372
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,545
32

373
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,047
5 years is a lot to subtract.

374
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,817
Why did you go after Miyata?

375
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:47,657
There are lots of rich
old men out there, aren't there?

376
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,856
Not really.

377
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,266
The police are after you.

378
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:06,679
But you didn't take any
money from Miyata. Why?

379
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,511
The deposit for the apartment...

380
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,616
He bought that damn
apartment with his savings.

381
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,294
So you kissed him good-bye.

382
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,629
And I know you were
a detective. I was wary.

383
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,272
So, what are you going to do?

384
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,135
What?

385
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:37,003
You know everything about me.
You knew where I was.

386
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:43,113
That's the problem.
I don't mess with yakuza...

387
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,882
Asai Shinobu...He's the boss, right?

388
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,518
I don't meddle with a mafia boss's woman.

389
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,302
So, why are you here?

390
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,935
I need help.

391
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,504
Ask Mr. Asai to help you.

392
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,877
I ran away from him.

393
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,289
I didn't know he was a yakuza.

394
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:24,751
He told me he ran a company.
He deceived me.

395
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,767
I always had a bad feeling...

396
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:49,882
If you mess around with yakuza,
you won't live long.

397
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:54,884
I'm not messing around.
That's why I'm here.

398
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,295
Help me escape.

399
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,425
Why should I...

400
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:06,899
I want to go overseas.
But my passport's still at Miyata's place.

401
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:12,775
You can get it, can't you?
I'll pay you well.

402
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,880
When did you run away?

403
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,612
Today. I came straight here.

404
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:26,619
You didn't know where I lived.
How'd you find out?

405
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:33,387
I had your card. You didn't answer
my call so I came directly.

406
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,121
"KANDA YUSUKE, DETECTIVE"

407
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:40,067
- You called...from your cellular?
- Yeah.

408
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:45,840
Give it to me. I'll erase the record.

409
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,104
I don't have it.

410
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,209
What?

411
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:54,512
Well, it was his cellular.
If I have it, he'd call me.

412
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:17,938
He's not home yet.

413
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,249
So you're helping me?

414
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,417
Why do you think I let you in?

415
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,595
If you caused any trouble,
you'd involve Miyata.

416
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,396
He knows nothing about you.

417
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,934
You didn't tell him?

418
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,866
Of course not.
He's depressed enough as it is.

419
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,400
- Oh.
- "Oh?"

420
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,145
I don't want you causing trouble
and becoming headline news.

421
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,917
I don't want to see him hurt anymore.

422
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:11,050
- 1,000,000 yen.
- What?

423
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,888
I'll help you escape for 1,000,000 yen.

424
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,397
Okay.

425
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,332
You idiot, don't touch this money!

426
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,665
Why not?

427
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,833
- You're giving it back.
- Huh?

428
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:33,346
You think the mafia will let anyone
get away with its money?

429
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:38,850
They'll come after you with a vengeance.
What'll happen then?

430
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:44,990
They'll do a betterjob than the cops.
You'll never get away.

431
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:52,602
You're gonna return that money.
Then, you have a chance.

432
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,730
Looking for somebody is pretty expensive.

433
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,733
If they get that back,
they might let you go.

434
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,637
No.

435
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,251
Look, you don't have a choice.

436
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:13,713
I could just turn you in,
or call Asai right now.

437
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,557
You're rolling in money.

438
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,487
I know which banks you have accounts in.

439
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:30,368
1,000,000 yen isn't so bad.

440
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,477
All right.

441
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,509
OK. Let's go.

442
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,310
What?

443
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,612
Your passport. I have a spare key.

444
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:47,590
Come on.

445
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,017
Now you tell me.

446
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,868
- You idiot!
- Ow!

447
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,699
Hide your shoes.

448
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,333
- I haven't taken them off.
- Hurry up!

449
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,034
I need the light.

450
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:33,029
You should change.
You're too conspicuous.

451
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:39,805
What? No way. That outfit's so dull.

452
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,707
- Miyata gave you that.
- Yeah.

453
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,743
Found it.

454
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,045
Hey.

455
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,415
In exchange for the 1,000,000 yen.

456
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,557
Change. I'm going to the toilet.

457
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:22,309
6,852 yen? Seriously?

458
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,399
Hello?

459
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,828
Hello? It's me.

460
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,406
Oh, Kanda. What's up?

461
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,473
Can you come out right now?
Let's have dinner.

462
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,506
Now? I just came home.

463
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,080
Then just come as you are. I'll buy.

464
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,850
Nah, I'm tired.

465
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,746
We need to talk.

466
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,386
Talk? Why are you whispering?

467
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:08,457
Uh...I'm working right now.
I'm tailing someone.

468
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,964
Then do yourjob.

469
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,326
When you finish, come over. I'll cook.

470
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:19,440
It's kind of important.
Come out right now. To the usual place.

471
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,738
What's so important?

472
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,504
It's about Ayumi.

473
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,651
You feel like coming out now?

474
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:36,655
I have work to do, so come right now.

475
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,547
Hey!

476
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,749
Hurry up and change.

477
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,884
I told you, I hate that outfit!

478
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,725
I'm paying you 1,000,000 yen,

479
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,861
so buy me something.

480
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,533
What are you doing?

481
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,232
Leaving it at the office.

482
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,579
Hey, are you really gonna give it back?

483
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:38,219
Of course.

484
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,220
Are you?

485
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,989
You can ease up on that left tit.
The money's going.

486
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,658
Flat chest.

487
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,805
"8F ASAI TRADINGS, INC."

488
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,968
Who are you?

489
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,177
Bike delivery.

490
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,978
Oh. How much?

491
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,426
Failing on the first day I introduce you.

492
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:51,321
Yes.

493
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:56,522
I've lost face, you useless jerk!

494
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,698
Hey! Come back, you!

495
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,057
You don't have to count it.

496
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,925
My passport.

497
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:42,011
Now we'll take the bullet train to Osaka.
You should leave Tokyo.

498
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,209
- I'll go alone.
- Huh?

499
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,983
If I have my passport, I'll be fine.

500
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,849
But...

501
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,148
That's hush money, right?

502
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,991
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

503
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,262
Oh...well, be careful, then.

504
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,937
You got what you wanted.

505
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,278
Money.

506
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,149
You said noble things about Miyata,

507
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:27,718
but you found out so much
about me and let me in today

508
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,993
because you smelled cash, right?

509
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,460
Then why?

510
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,792
He's my best friend from junior high.

511
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:44,536
You found out all that
about me because of that?

512
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,977
It's expensive to find people, right?

513
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,070
You wouldn't understand.

514
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,579
I do understand.

515
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,019
Then why didn't you go to the cops?

516
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:02,590
Because, if I made a big deal over it,
Miyata would find out about you.

517
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,384
You liar.

518
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:11,326
You planned on blackmailing me someday.

519
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:19,973
What women like you
think about is so sad.

520
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,876
What people think about, you mean.

521
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:34,484
Just admit it. I would have done
the same if I were you.

522
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,716
If I were you, I'd have killed myself.

523
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:46,125
I really do like men like you.

524
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:49,768
See ya.

525
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,847
Hello? Oh, sorry, I'll be right there.

526
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:27,774
Hey.

527
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,502
Don't "Hey" me. You're late.

528
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,078
Oh, sorry.

529
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,882
Have you ordered?

530
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,620
What is it?

531
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:42,680
What? Oh, yeah.

532
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,992
What?

533
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:48,125
Ayumi's getting married.

534
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,237
You met her?

535
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:59,941
Yeah. I ran into her today,
and we talked a bit.

536
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,842
She seemed well.

537
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,609
I'm Kuwata Maki.

538
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,444
Maki. Nice to meet you.

539
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,648
- Hello.
- Hello.

540
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,552
The hamburger steak here is good.

541
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,419
Oh, really?

542
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,024
- Huh?
- Oh, yes.

543
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,890
- Do you like hamburger?
- Oh, yes.

544
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,236
I'm going to the toilet.

545
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,635
You...

546
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,307
Good evening...

547
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,841
Good evening.

548
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:18,079
If you mess around with yakuza,
you won't live long.

549
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:40,674
Here.

550
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,573
I'm sorry. Thank you.

551
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:50,779
Yes. Says he was hired and
deceived by a girl named Ayumi.

552
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:55,416
Yes. He had 1,000,000 yen in new bills

553
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:00,021
Yes. Yes. I understand.

554
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,021
- To the office.
- Yes.

555
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,433
Um...let me explain...

556
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:08,331
Shut up! The boss will hear
you directly, so sit sill.

557
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,399
Um...can I get dressed?

558
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:18,946
No. When we kill you,
we have to dismember you,

559
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,743
so taking it of again is a hassle, see?

560
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,470
Miyata... Who is it?

561
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,703
A friend.

562
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:45,665
A friend?

563
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,341
A classmate from junior high.

564
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,076
Answer it.

565
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,272
Hello?

566
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,043
Where are you?

567
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:00,381
I'm...working.

568
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,526
Working? What about her?

569
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,491
Her? Do what you should.

570
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,694
What I should? What do you...

571
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,030
Look, I'm hanging up.
Good luck. It's your chance.

572
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,464
What's his chance?

573
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,704
No, um...

574
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:25,142
That was blatantly suspicious.

575
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,915
Uh, there's no connection...Really...

576
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,219
Well, do your explaining later.

577
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,586
Your life's at stake.

578
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,161
Yes, I'll do my best.

579
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,739
Bad connection.

580
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,118
Think of anything?

581
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:11,684
What?

582
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,928
An explanation.

583
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,065
No...

584
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:22,270
You should be thinking desperately.
Your life's at stake.

585
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:24,364
Yes.

586
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:26,641
Um...

587
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:32,440
Shut up until the boss comes.
Shiver there for now.

588
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:55,365
Hello, sir.

589
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:56,634
Hello, sir.

590
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,908
- Bring him in.
- Yes, sir.

591
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:25,624
- Go eat something. Good job.
- Thank you.

592
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,834
Now.

593
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:45,116
Mr. Detective, you know how much
it costs to get rid of someone?

594
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:54,051
We can do the killing. But we have
to hire someone to dispose of the body.

595
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,728
You know, a commissioned agent.
Pretty expensive.

596
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,962
And there are always risks.

597
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:08,199
If one of my men is caught, I have to
look after his family, and that's costly.

598
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:16,583
Honestly speaking, no man is
worth killing for that much trouble.

599
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,553
Oh.

600
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:25,085
But we yakuza have "face". Face. Get it?

601
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,829
...Yes.

602
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,793
You disgraced me.

603
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:37,462
If I let you get away with it,
I'm not a yakuza. Get it?

604
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,708
Yes...

605
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:48,180
Oh, forget the pretext.
From now on, you work for me for free.

606
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,284
I can use a detective.

607
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:54,081
And this money is mine.
You can go now.

608
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,820
Really?

609
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:02,724
Well, I searched your place.
I found this.

610
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,292
You do pretty good work.

611
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:15,535
You forget about this.
This is between her and me.

612
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,275
You can go.

613
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,746
Oh...thank you.

614
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,249
Well, then...

615
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:31,256
Oh, and this briefcase you brought...

616
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,022
These aren't mine.

617
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,596
And this was inside, too.

618
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,736
"KANDA YUSUKE, DETECTIVE"

619
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,708
So you didn't know?

620
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,516
I thought so.
I didn't think you were that stupid.

621
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,418
Then...the money...

622
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:03,353
I'll ask her now. She seems to have
lots of accounts, so I can't wait.

623
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,418
Did she say anything about her stuff?

624
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:42,556
She asked me to send
it to her new address.

625
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:51,705
"MIYATA"

626
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,409
- Oh, it's you.
- Sorry.

627
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,742
What do you want?

628
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:08,685
What?

629
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,053
Where's her stuff?

630
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,555
Oh. I threw it all out this morning.

631
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:22,236
I'm over her. Just like you said.

632
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,271
Did the garbage truck come already?

633
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,304
Yeah. A long time ago.

634
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:31,240
Hey, I have something to show you.

635
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:47,257
Ta-da! That girl last night's
phone number. I asked her.

636
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:52,227
I really felt like patting
myself on the back for this.

637
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:56,337
A guy has to do what
a guy has to do, you know?

638
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,369
But the way I acted last night was maybe

639
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:04,171
the "real" me.
Maybe that's who I really am.

640
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:14,251
Running a yakuza family
in this recession is tough.

641
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:21,695
This office costs 800,000 yen a month.
The electricity, 60,000 yen.

642
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:28,735
Feeding 8 men, 1,000,000 yen.
The phone bill, about 150,000 a month...

643
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,372
What? Who cares?

644
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:36,574
Money for ceremonial occasions
and such costs up to 2,000,000.

645
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,481
How much is that in all?

646
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:45,648
So, after subtracting the
necessary expenses from the profit

647
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,947
my own salary is just
over 1,000,000 a month.

648
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:54,595
But the boss can't live shabbily.

649
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,395
I have to eat and dress well
and date a gorgeous woman.

650
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,528
Image is everything.

651
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,099
Not everybody is here with
dreams of "Iove and duty"

652
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:13,312
Only the smell of
money'll attract people.

653
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,152
You can't tell?

654
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,953
Thanks, Yama-chan.
Sorry for making you do this.

655
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,096
No.

656
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,102
Oh, could you bring more paper after all?

657
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,065
Certainly.

658
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,035
I could use another 30,000,000 yen.

659
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,303
Yeah.

660
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,738
Excuse me. The new guy is here.

661
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,778
Oh. Let him wait.

662
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,612
Yes, sir.

663
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,025
OK, come in!

664
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:07,691
Excuse me.

665
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,769
Hi.

666
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,604
My name is Fujimoto.

667
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:15,371
How old are you?

668
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,102
I'm 19, sir!

669
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,611
Oh. The girls like you, right?

670
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,785
Yes! I mean...not really.

671
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,044
Are you hungry?

672
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:26,715
Yes.

673
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:29,891
We'll go out for dinner soon,
so let's talk then.

674
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,387
Yes.

675
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,723
Excuse me.

676
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,095
He saw them?

677
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,062
He saw them.

678
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:48,465
Yeah.

679
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:51,844
Excuse me. Ms. Yoko is here.

680
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:52,877
Oh, let her in.

681
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,243
No, make her wait a sec.

682
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:59,820
I'll be going then...

683
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:01,283
Oh, thanks a lot.

684
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,787
Okay, let her in!

685
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:19,769
It's my first time at your office,
so I'm kind of nervous.

686
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,108
Yoko, what do you want to eat?

687
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:25,973
Chinese?

688
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,109
Oh, Chinese? Sure.

689
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,077
Wait a sec.

690
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,397
Oh. I have to use the bathroom.

691
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:47,830
Sure, go ahead.

692
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:52,337
I want to fix my makeup,
so it may take some time. Go on ahead.

693
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,634
OK. We'll be right over there.

694
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,003
- You wait for her.
- Yes, sir.

695
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,769
Thanks.

696
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,206
Yes.

697
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,385
If you work hard, you can get anything.

698
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,924
Yes, sir!

699
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,794
Let's go, then.

700
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:26,668
"ASAI SHINOBU"

701
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,303
Where were you?

702
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:35,177
I...I was told to go buy cigarettes...
When I returned, she was...

703
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,197
I'm sorry!

704
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:57,996
What happened?

705
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,500
The money in the safe...

706
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,747
Look for it!

707
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,316
You move, too!

708
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,281
Yes.

709
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,051
Oh.

710
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:54,658
I'm sorry. We need more men.
Shall I call for help?

711
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,354
Idiot, do you want to make a fool of me?

712
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:01,798
Use just our men.
And don't make it a big deal.

713
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:02,936
Yes, sir.

714
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,604
Oh! Hey, when you find her,
bring her straight to me.

715
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,903
Don't ask her anything.

716
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:11,536
Yes, sir.

717
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,316
Who are you?

718
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,417
Bike delivery.

719
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,454
Oh. How much?

720
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:36,831
Hey! Come back, you!

721
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,267
What's wrong?

722
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:47,006
Someone brought this. Isn't it yours?

723
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,376
Oh!

724
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,924
Guess he brought the money back.

725
01:14:58,627 --> 01:14:59,924
You chase him, too!

726
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,687
Yes, sir!

727
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:33,350
"Phone call, Boss! Phone call, Boss!"

728
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:34,958
Boss.

729
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,654
Yeah. Did you get him?

730
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,492
No, we lost him.

731
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,161
Oh.

732
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:47,608
Look, the money's back, so don't
make it a big deal. I'll ask around, too.

733
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,078
Tell the others to be
quiet about this, too.

734
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,042
Yes, sir.

735
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:14,060
Its open.

736
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:18,636
Thanks, Yama-chan.

737
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,137
Anytime.

738
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:53,300
"KANDA DETECTIVE AGENCY"

739
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:30,311
"Phone call, Boss! Phone call, Boss!"

740
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:34,810
Hello?

741
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:39,480
Oh. You have some nerve.

742
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,053
Did you see the card?

743
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,816
Yeah.

744
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:49,921
He has the cash! He's at a restaurant
called "Adesso", so get him.

745
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:58,535
What do you mean?
You took off with the money.

746
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,504
He made me do it.

747
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,839
He has all the money, so get him, quick.

748
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:12,283
Did you touch the money?

749
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:17,649
No. I just gave it to him.

750
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:19,560
Oh.

751
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:23,396
Then I forgive you.
Come back. Where are...

752
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,769
That's right.

753
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:37,870
Go get him right now. Do it quietly.

754
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:43,616
And when you get him,
don't make him talk. I'll do the asking.

755
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,320
Keep him quiet until then.

756
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:54,284
All right? Not a word.

757
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,633
"YAMADA Setsuko"

758
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:46,176
"KUDO Mika, Nurse, 1st Surgical Department"

759
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,753
"8,000,000 yen."

760
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,584
"13,000,000 yen. 12,000,000 yen."

761
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:02,888
"4,000,000 yen"

762
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,237
Oh.

763
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:19,111
Yes. Says he was hired and
deceived by a girl named Ayumi.

764
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:24,442
Oh. He's probably just a crazy drug addict,
so shut him up.

765
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:25,777
Yes.

766
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:32,058
Did he have anything? Like...money?

767
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,221
He had 1,000,000 yen in new bills.

768
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:36,760
Are they real?

769
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:37,954
Yes.

770
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:39,964
Oh...

771
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:44,572
Wait at the office.
Keep him quiet until I get there.

772
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,570
Yes. I understand.

773
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,733
Miyata...

774
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:37,482
So she didn't take anything from him...

775
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,063
Oh, hello, Yama-chan?

776
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:53,534
I need to ask another favor.

777
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:45,646
- Please.
- Thank you.

778
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:50,081
Slippers, slippers.

779
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,122
Um, I don't have slippers.

780
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:54,254
That's no problem.

781
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,710
Please use this room.

782
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,113
Yes, thank you.

783
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:20,916
- Do you have things to wear?
- Oh, yes.

784
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:27,823
- I'll sleep in the other room.
- Oh, I see.

785
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,323
Will you take a bath?

786
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,833
Yes. I'm sorry.

787
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:37,865
No...

788
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:43,239
Um...I'm really sorry...

789
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:45,712
No...

790
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,679
This room is empty, anyway.

791
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:54,347
I mean, my old girlfriend...

792
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:58,523
Ayumi.

793
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:01,557
Yes.

794
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:08,597
We actually only lived together for a week.

795
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:13,162
She left right after I bought this place.

796
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:15,467
Why?

797
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:17,175
Hmm?

798
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:19,539
Why did she leave?

799
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:27,285
She suddenly told me
she loved somebody else.

800
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:32,683
I hear she's getting married to that guy.

801
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,427
That's terrible.

802
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:42,628
Well...she couldn't help it.

803
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,771
She couldn't help it?

804
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,166
Yes, probably.

805
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:53,038
It's a matter of feelings.

806
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:56,683
We didn't sign a contract.

807
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:04,916
Anyway, please feel free to use this room.
You can think about...

808
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,265
I'm sorry.

809
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:19,707
No, it's all right.

810
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,407
I'll go get the bath ready.

811
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:14,387
Yes.

812
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:18,831
Um...Which bath salt do you want?

813
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:25,402
"Smooth Skin Beppu Spa" or "Hakone Spa"?

814
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:30,334
Excuse me.

815
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,670
It's none of your business.

816
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,105
- I'll go now.
- What?

817
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:05,613
Thank you for everything.

818
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,075
Where are you going?

819
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:14,555
I'm sorry.

820
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:20,388
When you find what you need, leave.

821
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:23,089
I'll throw the rest away.

822
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:26,959
Good-bye.

823
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:42,640
Hey.

824
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:51,289
I'm devastated. You said you loved me.

825
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,161
No, this isn't...I...uh...

826
01:28:56,998 --> 01:29:00,024
Can't think of a good lie so suddenly?

827
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:02,826
Even a pro like you.

828
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,751
You're some woman.

829
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,854
So that detective blackmailed you?

830
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:30,754
Two for one stone, eh?
Blame it on him and take the money.

831
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:37,295
I really do have an eye for people.

832
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:42,966
People who are loyal to
their desires are attractive.

833
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:52,884
OK. From now on, we're business partners.

834
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:58,253
A talented actress like you
needs good management.

835
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:01,058
I can write out a contract if you want.

836
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:09,532
I'll take 10,000,000 yen
as registration fee for starters.

837
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:21,478
Pretty cheap, right?
Aren't you Ionely by yourself?

838
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:28,777
It's sad being alone.

839
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:09,121
I have to go on living alone on this planet.

840
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:16,461
I can go on living alone.

841
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:21,574
He seems to be a pretty decent guy.

842
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:28,610
A clumsy and straightforward guy
like that is sincere.

843
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:32,616
He'll probably do his best
to make you happy.

844
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:40,010
Huh?

845
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:41,421
It's false?

846
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:42,853
No...

847
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:45,821
Maybe she made a mistake.

848
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:49,355
She didn't make a mistake. She lied.

849
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:52,129
A lie? That can't be true.

850
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:54,797
It happens.

851
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,368
Women do things like that.

852
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:05,144
Maybe this is an 8 and not a 6.

853
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:08,315
Give it up. It's false.

854
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:09,448
She wouldn't do such a...

855
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:11,584
Women do.

856
01:33:12,486 --> 01:33:15,512
You've learned a lesson. Give up.

857
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:20,623
At least you brought yourself to ask.
Now get over it.

858
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:25,559
She made a mistake.

859
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:26,790
Come on...

860
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:29,595
She's not the kind of person who'd lie.

861
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:36,565
You sound like a kid in junior high.

862
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:40,076
Why do you trust someone
so easily and so completely?

863
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,841
She's not like that.

864
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:49,889
You live on another planet by yourself.
Hurry back to Earth.

865
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:51,319
No.

866
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:56,357
This is an 8, not a 6!

867
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,564
That's a 6!

868
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:04,469
"The number you have dialed
is currently not in use."

869
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:09,333
"Please check the number and try again."
