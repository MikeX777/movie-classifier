1
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,451
If they only were Rudy,
I wouldn't take another step.

2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,080
- But there's only one Rudy.
- She's bit all light.

3
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,639
She's driving me completely mad,
that's for sure.

4
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:40,646
Just one Rudy. And so many
millions and millions of us.

5
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,600
Let's get out of here.

6
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,917
Hurry up, they are coming.

7
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,919
The car.

8
00:01:57,394 --> 00:02:00,125
Be my sheep and ride with me
over the sand dunes.

9
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:03,437
Kiss me, Rudy.
Kiss me quickly.

10
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:14,802
- God, I could have loved her.
- I could have too.

11
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:18,673
Do you realize that tomorrow
we are finally free.

12
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:21,674
We can actually ride across
the sand dunes and be loved.

13
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,117
Actually lie down and be loved.

14
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,672
We're so overdue,
as we both know too well.

15
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,709
Everything in its time. We are the
most educated women in this country.

16
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:35,599
But in the ways of love
we're kindergarten toddlers.

17
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:40,595
Cat, fantastic idea: let's not start
our graduation trip in Paris.

18
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:44,717
- Oh God. - Look, let's start...
- I love this.

19
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:51,590
Galloping across the burning sands of
Morocco in the arms of a real sheik.

20
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:55,351
Listen, we can spend our nights
learning of ecstasy.

21
00:02:55,504 --> 00:03:00,670
What a beautiful word, ecstasy.
Ext...

22
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:05,193
- No. E-C ecstasy.
- Let's go on it.

23
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,904
- Mac, I don't know. You're serious.
- Do the backstroke in it.

24
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:12,110
- You are serious.
- Then you'll go?

25
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:14,913
- Do I have a choice? - No.
- I don't like choices.

26
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,344
Congratulations to you, Miss Pipps.

27
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,550
Tomorrow the Sahara.
Blood on the sand.

28
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:33,105
Well done, Miss McGillvary.

29
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:42,300
Oh, Cotton. Stop the car.

30
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,862
Sorry. I just have to do something
that I've been dreaming of for years.

31
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:50,506
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:58,690
Yes!

33
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:06,524
- Who was that?
- I believe that's the attorney.

34
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:11,210
- What's he so happy about? - He
probably liked the entertainment.

35
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Cotton. I'm so sorry.
I've embarrassed you.

36
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,203
How awful for you. But, you see,
I just had to do this. I had...

37
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:32,842
I had so many years of being
so very proper, I got claustrophobia.

38
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:36,967
You're terribly embarrassed.
Can you ever forgive me?

39
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:40,643
- That's not my position.
- Not your position?

40
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,161
No, Miss.

41
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:48,995
Because you drive that big car,
you can't forgive me for something?

42
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:53,637
- That more or less covers it.
- Because you drive the car.

43
00:05:53,794 --> 00:06:00,243
- Yes. - Then I'll drive the car.
Can you forgive me now?

44
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:04,681
You'll drive the car?
Does that mean that I'm fired?

45
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:08,075
If that's what it takes
to allow you to answer.

46
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:13,316
I haven't been without a job
since I was thirteen years old.

47
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,840
Okay, what was the question?
Do I forgive you for embarrassing me?

48
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,480
That was the question.

49
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,032
- At first I was puzzled. Thenâ€œ
- You were embarrassed.

50
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,759
- No.
- I'm glad.

51
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:35,833
How was amazed how much you changed
since the last time I say you naked.

52
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:42,153
- Naked? - I thing you were three
or four. You've grown well.

53
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:47,310
I think that was nicely said.
Would you like your old job back?

54
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:52,675
- Is it still available? - It is if
you'll be my friend and talk to me.

55
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:56,067
- I haven't much to say.
- But you'll say it?

56
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:01,583
Let's get the hell out of here.

57
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,710
He's a pretty spiffy
looking attorney.

58
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:13,988
Today is the day I become
an excessively rich little bitch.

59
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,383
- You'll still be my friend.
- If that's the way to keep my job.

60
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,827
- Unit's the only way.
- Pretty tough way to keep the job.

61
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:25,141
I'm told life is not easy.

62
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:28,748
Hi!

63
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:34,426
Miss McGillvary, I'm Robert Stewart,
your father's armour solicitor.

64
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:38,820
I mean you no disrespect. Not at all.
To the contrary.

65
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:45,095
I wish when I graduated, I'd been
cheeky enough to do what you did.

66
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:48,463
I give you my diploma,
and you give me what?

67
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:57,858
Gee whiz it's Cotton.
I think I own the whole world.

68
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,611
At least all the good parts of it.

69
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,502
Now we must watch our steps
in every sense of the word.

70
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,620
As we wind our way
through the casbah. Come.

71
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,617
We should have a policeman with us.
Don't you think we should have one?

72
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,536
They wouldn't be welcome here. It's
more dangerous for them than for you.

73
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,899
Life is not without its risks.
A ponder a bit more in the casbah.

74
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:26,257
Hey, Mohanmed. Look, look.

75
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:29,738
I'm still scared.

76
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:32,810
Cat, I'll protect you with my life
if necessary.

77
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:35,731
Protect me? You're half naked.
They'll get you first.

78
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:39,572
- No. They'll what?
- Make you not a virgin

79
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,172
Isn't that what we're here for?

80
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:48,411
This door, it may this very night
hold in its bosom your sheik.

81
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:49,690
Wow.

82
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:55,565
Shall we see? We can ask Allah
for one authentic sheik.

83
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,089
If you'd be so kind.

84
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:20,128
I like that.

85
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,688
Don't you like that, Cat?
I like that.

86
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:30,397
Yeah, I like it. Come on.

87
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:48,078
So sweet.

88
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:04,070
Catalina, look.
Look!

89
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,276
- What do the camels do?
- They are for sale.

90
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,116
- Cotton, wouldn't you just love one?
- "Phat may be too strong a word.

91
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:21,272
Allah is kind. Mliss, your sheik.

92
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,669
- Miss? Your sheik!
- Sheik?

93
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:27,273
Yes, he is a young one.
A pop you might say.

94
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:34,310
He comes from the south,
across uncountable miles of sand.

95
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:39,948
- His father is a great pasha.
- Catalina, do you see him?

96
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,835
- No.
- Well, look.

97
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:46,227
Hey, Mac, he could be your sister!

98
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:53,187
Miss, would you like to meet
the sheik now?

99
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:58,073
I'll wait here, thanks.
If you're still with me, Cotton.

100
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:01,544
- We'll stay here. - You're not
going to pass on a real sheik?

101
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:07,104
- There's only one. - Being that's
probably enough for both of us.

102
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,309
But if you are too scared,
I'll brave this one myself.

103
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,588
Okay. We wait. Go.

104
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:39,902
Honourable sheik. Allow me to
introduce this American lady to you.

105
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:43,501
She has come all the way
from her country just to meet you.

106
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:46,544
How do you do?

107
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:52,942
- Well, thank you. And you?
- You are a vision.

108
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:59,298
- Thank you. You may go now.
- Miss McGillvary?

109
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,296
Thank you. I'll be fine. Tell my
friends I'll rejoin them in a minute.

110
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,020
As you wish.

111
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,054
Sit here, if you like.
Please.

112
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:24,053
I never dreamed
that there was anyone,

113
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:26,857
anyone on this earth like you.

114
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:31,250
If there was,
I shall never look upon her.

115
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:39,055
- And now I am Allah is too kind.
- No, it's you that is too kind.

116
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:44,608
What did that man say?
You've come to meet me?

117
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:50,166
- Yes.
- Why? May I know why?

118
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:56,853
- Well, it's along story.
- Does it have a short answer?

119
00:12:57,002 --> 00:13:01,801
- Yes, it does.
- It is possible that I may hear it?

120
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,250
Well, it's going
to sound so stupid now.

121
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,801
I've come all this way to give
you something you may not even want:

122
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:16,120
my virginity.

123
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:26,837
I've never been given
this before. Is it ?ue?

124
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,365
Will you take the gift?

125
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:38,196
This very night. You'll come with me

126
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:43,599
to my palace and I will take
your gift with great happiness.

127
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:47,802
I had dreamed of a beautiful tent
and desert.

128
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,719
I can give you the whole
golden Sahara and a thousand tents.

129
00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:55,876
- We'll leave tonight.
- It's not too far?

130
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,432
- I have an aeroplane.
- You have an aeroplane?

131
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:08,109
- How else could I fly you?
- Of course. Could we go tomorrow?

132
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:16,357
- I'll be carrying the same
with me? - Only a day older.

133
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:22,874
- Do you think I'm mad, Cotton?
- No, not mad. - Or maybe bad?

134
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,676
- The truth?
- Can I take it?

135
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:27,955
- I envy your spirit.
- Thank you.

136
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:31,950
This is a parachute.
I'm going to buckle it right here.

137
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,425
- I don't want you to use it.
- No.

138
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:38,634
- But if you have to, you pull this
little right, right there. - Okay.

139
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:41,867
- I'll save the biggest piece
of the cake for you. - Mac.

140
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:46,107
That's because I love you and because
this airplane scares me too much.

141
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:48,310
I'll rather you were going
on a camel.

142
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:52,712
This is a magnificent aircraft.

143
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:56,910
It's at least five years
ahead of its time.

144
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,668
An experimental design.
It's magnificent.

145
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,139
Everything's all light.

146
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:19,096
Hold on fight.

147
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,740
The sun's completely gone.

148
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:46,982
Her fat's in the fire now.

149
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:51,615
I don't know about that. She should
not have troubles handling that boy.

150
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,976
May I have the pleasure?

151
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,855
No, thank you. I don't wanna live
my husband alone. Thanks for asking.

152
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,696
- Dance with the gentleman.
- You don't mind?

153
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:15,532
You know how much I like to see
my wife have a good time.

154
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:29,250
- Go on. Hurry. Tell me.
- Cat, all right.

155
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:33,887
Well, we ?ew over
a billions miles of sand.

156
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,286
Remember, Cat,
how in the moving pictures,

157
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:14,485
Valentino rode the sand dunes and
swept the heroine off her feet.

158
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:18,243
- Yes.
- I asked my sheik to do that to me.

159
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:21,047
You should have seen him.
It was so sad.

160
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:24,723
Every time he would try to be
Valentino and sweep me off my feet,

161
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,842
his horse would go to the other way.

162
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,917
What happened?

163
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:32,999
- What's the matter?
- I hate horses.

164
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,555
You can't hate horses.
You are a sheik.

165
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:42,353
I know I'm a sheik.
I had an English nanny.

166
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:45,914
- He had an English nanny?
- The nanny was all right.

167
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:51,361
I go to school at Oxford. I've been
here three times my whole life.

168
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,994
- I'm a poet.
- You're still a sheik.

169
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,676
It will be hard to keep us
with this for the rest of my life.

170
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:09,429
Do you realize that no man on this
earth will ever again know the joy

171
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,114
that you
will bring me this night.

172
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:19,467
You're like a most precious ?ower.

173
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:25,028
Your blooming can only be enjoyed,
once. just once.

174
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:28,711
His tent was a dream
It was gigantic.

175
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:33,825
Filled with servants
and dancing girls, and belly dancers.

176
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:36,462
They do incredible thing
with their stomachs, Cat.

177
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,465
What? What do they do?

178
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:23,905
Fantastic. What happened then?

179
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,819
- He kissed me.
- What?

180
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:32,820
- He lay me down so gently, but
positively. - I'd have died.

181
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:46,691
- And then, he undressed me.
- What?

182
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,332
Everything? I mean, everything?

183
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,689
- Everything. - Was everyone still
there? - No. He had them sent away.

184
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:24,640
Every time he went for the honey,

185
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:30,242
my stomach would sort of rise
to meet his lips.

186
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,032
- Why would your stomach rise?
- I guess it was inviting him.

187
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,830
- To where, Mac, to where?
- Catalina! - There, of course.

188
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:09,108
- What? - Cat? - What?
- I have been lying.

189
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:10,427
Lying!

190
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:20,951
I don't know, when we were...
When it should have happened...

191
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,064
No, Mac. He went to sleep?

192
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,824
It's all right.

193
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,949
My ego tells me the sleep was from
the magic smoke, not me.

194
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:56,582
Oh, Rudy.
Why are they all counterfeits?

195
00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:03,225
Look at me. I'm all undressed up
with no place to go.

196
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:08,542
Mac, Mac. Now what do we do?

197
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,780
Well, we try again.

198
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:15,063
Not this place. Scares me.

199
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:19,458
Couldn't we go some place
like Switzerland? Or Sweden?

200
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:22,982
- Holland? It's a nice place.
- Holland? Cat...

201
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:27,182
It should be warm and sultry and dark
eyed when you give virginity away.

202
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:28,572
Like Italy or Spain

203
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:33,294
Italians scare me too much And Mac,

204
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:37,421
I can't give my virginity away
in Spain. I am Spanish.

205
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,336
I know you are Spanish
And you can't go to Barcelona.

206
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,858
So we won't even go near Barcelona.

207
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:52,173
Hello, Toro.

208
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,806
- Matador.
- You're a matador.

209
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,885
- Too many seasons ago.
- It must have been magnificent.

210
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:48,403
I hate some afternoons.

211
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:20,445
My God, what's he doing?
The horse could be killed.

212
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:23,721
This is a kind of festival.
You see the bull's hams?

213
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:27,672
They're capped. But even in the big
bull ring, you never kill bulls.

214
00:25:27,832 --> 00:25:32,360
If you go used to fight
without the blood. Nothing.

215
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:36,310
Me is not so popular with the people.
I like little bit of blood.

216
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,552
Cotton, did you understand
what he said?

217
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,475
Yeah He never the bull kills,
never the blood sheds.

218
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,678
Therefore he's not very popular
with the people.

219
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,637
I think I'm going to enjoy it.

220
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:50,589
- Does all this make the ends of your
boots curl up? - Tight as a drum.

221
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,537
- Who's that?
- She is his gypsy shadow.

222
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,819
- Cotton, did you...
- She's his gipsy shadow.

223
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:15,604
Mac, what's wrong?

224
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:18,288
I'm gonna see the duke
who's half man half horse.

225
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:21,127
- Where do I find him?
- In the chapel. - Okay.

226
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,613
See you later, everybody.

227
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:44,962
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

228
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:53,727
I just wanted to say I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

229
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,765
Nor have I.

230
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:02,641
Do you think it's possible
could I see your horses?

231
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:04,762
With pleasure.

232
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:15,432
You know horses.

233
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:18,755
I love them.
I was raised with them at school.

234
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:24,681
But ours were different: they would
run and jump and go around the field.

235
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:29,233
But yours are magical. They're like
Pegasus. Aren't you like Pegasus?

236
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,759
I would consider it an honour if
you would join me at dimer tonight.

237
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:42,271
- Thank you. But I have two friends.
- Bring them.

238
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:45,513
Thank you.

239
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:54,117
You didn't have to invite them to
our private moments for family only.

240
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:59,147
It's bad enough that
that gypsy child is always with you.

241
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:03,025
We never have any time alone,
with you living in the country.

242
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,869
You never come to the city.

243
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:09,824
- Why don't you put butter on your
mouth? - I didn't come here to eat.

244
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:13,350
That's too bad.
That was very fine chow.

245
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:21,669
He hasn't spoken to us all night.
Hardly even a look.

246
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:44,500
Did you invite enjoy the fight,
Cotton?

247
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:50,305
- He's sending you messages?
- You noticed?

248
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:03,061
- That's a pretty big message.
- Feels like it.

249
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:11,862
It's nice, Cat?

250
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:19,223
- If that's what you want.
- Come on, Cat, have some fun.

251
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,533
Send someone a message.

252
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,139
- Who I see there?
- Him.

253
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,331
Angel, Angel. She looked at me.

254
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:37,049
- Mac, God.
- lust practice on him

255
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,017
Yeah, you're mad.

256
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:44,254
I could be if someone
would just give me the chance.

257
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:49,617
She knows a real man when
she sees one. Now it's your table.

258
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:53,293
Take care of the woman.
See Mama home.

259
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:58,735
- You must come to see me more often.
- I will, Mama.

260
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,366
Goodnight.

261
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,722
Mama.

262
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:52,321
- Where's he going?
- I know where he goes.

263
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:56,274
I know you know.
That's why I'm asking. Where?

264
00:32:56,434 --> 00:33:00,280
- Why do you care where he goes?
- I want to see him.

265
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:03,404
I don't think he wants.

266
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:09,278
- What's your name.
- Paloma.

267
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:13,118
Paloma, do you think
we could do business with this?

268
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:19,518
- The mirror is for me?
- It is if you take me to him.

269
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:24,710
- Do you accept? - Is too much.
For you is nothing.

270
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:29,874
No, for me is very beautiful
and very valuable.

271
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:33,475
- For me, too.
- Good, then it's done?

272
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,039
- Sure.
- Okay.

273
00:33:35,188 --> 00:33:40,035
- Now, are we going to be welcome?
- You are no welcome,

274
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:44,430
because for a gipsy
no stranger is welcome.

275
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:49,194
But you are with me.
So will be all light.

276
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:53,349
- Okay. Sorry.
- I think.

277
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:13,949
Angel, Angel.
I have the rich lady.

278
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:16,102
I have the rich lady.

279
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,151
- Why do you bring her here?
- She gave me this.

280
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,941
- What lady? - The blond lady.
Angel and Ramon say

281
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,138
she is the most beautiful woman
in all the world.

282
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:48,142
You want to go to the bed
with my man?

283
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:52,219
- None of us want to go to bed
with your man. - It's true?

284
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:55,544
Do I look so dishonest?

285
00:34:55,694 --> 00:35:00,700
- It's hue?
- I think your man is very beautiful.

286
00:35:00,854 --> 00:35:04,982
You say good. And do you want
to take him to your bed?

287
00:35:05,132 --> 00:35:09,501
- I think. - I think no.
I'm the woman for his bed.

288
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:14,053
And there will be no other.
No other.

289
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,253
- Tres du may.
- Hey. How long has he been with her?

290
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,050
Since her thirteen years birthday.
Is me next.

291
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,451
Soon he's going to take me.

292
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:36,897
- He'll do what?
- Take me. I'll be his woman.

293
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:39,287
You'll be his what?

294
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:51,124
- Woman.
- Oh, damn

295
00:35:52,804 --> 00:35:54,966
It looks like you're all out of luck.

296
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:57,570
The little firebrand
is taking her man to bed.

297
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:04,690
You know something? I think
it's time we all went beddy-bye.

298
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:10,326
Why he do that?
He do no even like her anymore.

299
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:17,011
Thank you Paloma. It's been
a very interesting experience.

300
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,085
- I hope your 14th birthday come
soon - You're not going to town?

301
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,004
Like Cotton said,
we are all going to bed.

302
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:31,484
- Where will you sleep? - Wherever
they sleep, I sleep on the ?oor.

303
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:33,879
You've got a deal.

304
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:39,406
- Get out of the tub.
- I wanna stay here forever.

305
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:42,321
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

306
00:36:43,956 --> 00:36:47,845
What a mess. Look at you!

307
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:51,521
What are we going to do today?
Am I going to help you?

308
00:36:51,674 --> 00:36:56,236
- Absolutely. Here we go, up.
Stand up. - No.

309
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:59,680
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to rinse you off.

310
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,721
- But why?
- So you don't itch.

311
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:04,352
- But...
- Look at you.

312
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:08,801
I am woman. Ready.
Juicy too.

313
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:16,515
We're not up here, freezing our tiny
titties off,

314
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,071
because you just want
to buy a house today.

315
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,313
- We are not?
- No, Miss McGillvary, we are not.

316
00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:28,838
You want this beautiful yan
to quickly beg your virginity.

317
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:33,992
That's why we're freezing up here
in the dumb car that won't 11111.

318
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:36,911
I might kill two birds
with one stone.

319
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:40,195
Don't you have to be in love
with him to do that?

320
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:42,872
I don't know.
I've never done it before.

321
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:52,035
Oh my God.

322
00:37:57,702 --> 00:38:01,991
All light. Very slowly,
everybody back into the car.

323
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:04,952
- Okay.
- But he could break this car.

324
00:38:05,102 --> 00:38:09,025
I'll hit it between the eyes.

325
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,344
- Cotton, there's a bull.
- There's a lot of bull.

326
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:33,060
What are you doing way up here?

327
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,777
She said you may be in the mountains
for a week. I couldn't wait.

328
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,381
You came to see me?

329
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:41,779
Some of your bulls had run up
into the mountains after cows,

330
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,825
and you're to get them before
they froze. Was that one of them?

331
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:51,305
He was.
Why did you want to see me?

332
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,502
- I want to buy some of your horses.
- I don't sell horses.

333
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:02,701
- Not even young ones?
- I sell wine and bulls.

334
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:06,252
- I don't sell horses. I'm sorry.
- "Phat seems so final.

335
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,301
I'm sorry. I feel so badly.

336
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,420
I would like to offer you
the hospitality of my home.

337
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,891
But it's so far away
from this mountain top.

338
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:22,294
Well, if you found all you wayward
bulls, you'd ride in the car with us.

339
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:26,498
- That would be very nice of you.
- It's our pleasure.

340
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:35,370
Raphael? You were supposed
to bring back all the horses.

341
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:39,052
Assuming you owned one of my horses
right now.

342
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:43,004
- What should you do with it?
- If I owned one of your horses now?

343
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:49,012
I'd tell him I am not your owner,
I'm your friend.

344
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:56,093
Gracias, Raphael.

345
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,849
These horses are nothing
without the bulls.

346
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:05,241
Can you really see yourself
doing this?

347
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,849
I can. But then some people
think I'm crazy.

348
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,891
You're sure there's no amount
of money that can buy that horse?

349
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,647
- No amount. - But isn't it said
that everything has its price?

350
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:22,404
My wine does. My horses don't.

351
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:28,518
- Mac, that's a beautiful horse.
- I know. I want him.

352
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,166
Sure you do.

353
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:37,200
May I invite you to dimer tonight,
trying to change your mind?

354
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:42,360
I would enjoy such a dinner.
But I have planes I cannot cancel.

355
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:48,401
- What a shame. You're sure?
- Sadly it's hue.

356
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:55,156
- What if I were not to talk about
horses, but wine? - Even more sadly.

357
00:40:56,952 --> 00:41:00,240
I surrender.
I've run out of what it's.

358
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:07,556
If we get back to the hotel,
we'll dine with the old gang tonight.

359
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,193
I think I'm just going to go
to bed and lick my wounds.

360
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,194
You just lost a battle.
You didn't lose a war.

361
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:21,514
Mac, do you think Cotton believed
your little wounded lady story?

362
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:25,671
I think so. It was partly true.

363
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:28,352
Why I can't come with you?

364
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:32,067
Because an Appian den is not a place
for little girls.

365
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:37,105
You can stay there and bath,
I mean swim in the tub.

366
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:40,473
I'm no little girl.

367
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,434
Mac. Do you know
anything about opium?

368
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:48,067
Next to nothing. Except
that it sounds romantic.

369
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:52,625
The textbooks say
that opium has two faces.

370
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:55,547
First a face: killer,
in large amounts.

371
00:41:55,702 --> 00:41:59,468
Second a face, a love potion,
in small amounts.

372
00:41:59,622 --> 00:42:03,830
Well, then it seems
as long as we're going to use it,

373
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,984
it should be exclusively
in the romantic amount.

374
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,898
Paloma.

375
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:16,904
Are you sure Angel's
going to be in this place tonight.

376
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:21,461
Sure he's going to be.
If he not there tonight,

377
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:23,505
I'll give you back...

378
00:42:24,536 --> 00:42:28,507
mirror and pearl.

379
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:29,942
Please!

380
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:34,226
All right. I make exceptions
for you and your friend.

381
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:37,901
- Thank you very much
- Do you know the puppy well?

382
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:41,342
- We are acquainted.
- May I offer to guide you?

383
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,462
If you would be so kind.

384
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:49,093
A love potion, in small amounts.

385
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:52,176
Are we really going to do this?

386
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:56,860
- I am.
- Well I hope we have a good time.

387
00:42:57,012 --> 00:43:00,571
Oh, shit. I can't.

388
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:14,377
It's so hot.

389
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,897
Mac?

390
00:43:19,048 --> 00:43:24,416
Can you feel yourself going or gone?

391
00:43:24,566 --> 00:43:29,493
Definitely. Can you?

392
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:36,694
Nice, really.

393
00:43:38,924 --> 00:43:44,964
Nice? Oh, Cat,
it's more than nice.

394
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,090
I know.

395
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:58,771
The lady said: move slowly.

396
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,966
Always slowly.

397
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,080
I think it's time to find Angel.

398
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:40,039
- Is something wrong?
- No.

399
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:45,956
We were expecting Angel Sacristan.

400
00:44:46,112 --> 00:44:49,434
I see. If you wait a minute, please.

401
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:53,677
Of course. We'll wait.

402
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,513
It looks as though our little gypsy
was light.

403
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:11,554
Seems he is here.

404
00:45:13,508 --> 00:45:18,387
If he is, what are you going to do?

405
00:45:18,546 --> 00:45:22,915
- Lie down and say: hi?
- Hi?

406
00:45:23,946 --> 00:45:26,836
I don't sell horses.

407
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,108
Only wine and bulls.

408
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:37,953
How many bottles of wine
would you say you had?

409
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:41,390
Maybe a million.

410
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:47,902
What? Nobody has
a million bottles of wine.

411
00:45:48,062 --> 00:45:53,908
I wonder how long it would take to
count to a million bottles of wine.

412
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,668
What happened? About three hundred
bottles... I mean, this...

413
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,382
- We got... And this is no way?
- What? No.

414
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,748
- Twenty...
- Was I light?

415
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:11,061
One 1111111011,
two million, five million?

416
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:17,025
Angel, how much would it take
to buy everything you produce?

417
00:46:17,176 --> 00:46:19,304
- Everything that I produce?
- Yes.

418
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:23,256
- Do you know about wine?
- Catalina's family has vineyards.

419
00:46:25,336 --> 00:46:28,941
- Look, Angel, can you excuse us
a minute? - Of course.

420
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:35,824
Mac, buy it.
You have too much money. Buy it.

421
00:46:35,974 --> 00:46:39,215
I'll run it. If I was a boy,
I was supposed to run ours.

422
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:41,454
- Please do it. I'll divide up
the profit. - Yes.

423
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:46,493
I'll accept whatever two out three
local banks value my wine it. Fair?

424
00:46:48,092 --> 00:46:49,298
Fantastic!

425
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,691
You must immediately close the deal
with the bank

426
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,456
because they hold
the paper on the wine.

427
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,419
They're saving their position.

428
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:01,292
Go to the lab: we leave immediately.
Tell the bank that we're coming.

429
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,975
Fantastic. Wow! Fantastic!

430
00:47:06,648 --> 00:47:09,094
Fantastic! God!

431
00:47:09,248 --> 00:47:11,728
Well...

432
00:47:16,206 --> 00:47:19,927
now that that's behind us,

433
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:22,817
why don't we talk about
that honey coloured horse?

434
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:27,886
I'm sorry but
I really don't sell horses.

435
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:32,049
Maybe the word sell is where
we're having our problem.

436
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:34,410
Maybe.

437
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,361
- It was wonderful. Did you freeze?
- Didn't you?

438
00:48:39,512 --> 00:48:43,517
I was warm as toast. I think
I'm intoxicated by your horse.

439
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:46,560
- Your horse.
- Of course, my horse.

440
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:51,034
I never dreamed there was such a
beautiful horse. What am I smelling?

441
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:55,240
- Hot cinnamon wine.
- Oh, I'd love some.

442
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,790
- Didn't I smell something
chocolaty... - Angel!

443
00:48:58,948 --> 00:49:00,837
You gave her the golden horse.

444
00:49:00,988 --> 00:49:03,559
- Hardly, I...
- I don't speak to you.

445
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,075
- Natty, she is my guest.
- Your guest.

446
00:49:06,228 --> 00:49:10,151
- Goodnight, Natty. - You bitch.
- All light. That's enough.

447
00:49:10,306 --> 00:49:12,673
You bitch. Bitch!

448
00:49:21,264 --> 00:49:25,792
- Now I kill you, I have to kill you.
- No more, Natty. No more.

449
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:30,785
- You're going back to camp.
- Love me tonight.

450
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:34,992
Stop it, please.
Please stop it, Natty.

451
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:40,467
- Now I have to kill you.
- Shut up. - You shut up.

452
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:45,991
- I kill you for sure.
- Then go get you knife.

453
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,705
Please, Natty. Go home.

454
00:50:10,376 --> 00:50:11,457
Hello.

455
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:15,346
I apologize.

456
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:19,542
I think
I've known her too long.

457
00:50:19,694 --> 00:50:23,415
You've know her, I believe
since her fourteenth birthday.

458
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:28,935
The gypsy world is very different.

459
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:33,737
Fourteen years is very different.

460
00:50:35,372 --> 00:50:37,215
Does this interest you?

461
00:50:40,932 --> 00:50:43,695
I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

462
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,253
Fine. Why don't we go to a more
comfortable room,

463
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,415
enjoy some chocolate cake
and investigate the difference.

464
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:58,655
And then he fell asleep. So now
you have the story of my sheik.

465
00:50:58,808 --> 00:51:02,335
Maybe you should
have come to Spain first.

466
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,533
Maybe I should have.

467
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:14,134
And now would you consider
giving this burden to me?

468
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:20,965
Would you be interested in taking it?

469
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,968
Please.

470
00:51:33,282 --> 00:51:38,971
Rest. And I'll join you here
at sunrise.

471
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,044
Sunrise.

472
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:58,085
Now seems just perfect.

473
00:51:59,118 --> 00:52:01,689
The fruit is about
to fall from the tree.

474
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:09,646
That was beautiful, thank you.
I'll rest in here tonight.

475
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:13,243
Make sure to wake me exactly,
and I mean exactly

476
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,239
half hour before the sun rises.

477
00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:18,955
Well, tonight you make baby.

478
00:52:24,194 --> 00:52:28,481
He's either very clever
or very cruel.

479
00:52:28,632 --> 00:52:31,317
Because I'm going mad with wonder.

480
00:52:31,472 --> 00:52:36,399
Angel. Angel. It's time.

481
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,754
Angel. You awake?

482
00:52:51,388 --> 00:52:53,152
What are you doing?

483
00:52:53,308 --> 00:52:56,357
I thought you should be
as scared to death as I am

484
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:07,072
- You are a ghost who is afraid?
- It's about to wet it's pants.

485
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:11,510
I was so secure
when I came in here last night

486
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:15,953
but then I was also
as high as a kite. Angel?

487
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:20,393
Angel? What are you doing?
Angel? What are you doing?

488
00:53:21,624 --> 00:53:26,310
Have you gone?
Are you still here?

489
00:53:26,462 --> 00:53:28,863
Angel, are you still here?

490
00:53:30,982 --> 00:53:34,873
I knew this sheet was a dumb idea.
I shouldn't done the...

491
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:37,427
Oh my God.

492
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,506
You are as naked
as the day you were born.

493
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,107
That's true. But only because
it's been found to be

494
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:50,219
the most practical way to make love.
- Are you gonna kiss me?

495
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:53,029
I thought I was.

496
00:53:56,618 --> 00:54:00,018
- May I kiss you instead?
- Whatever you like.

497
00:54:00,176 --> 00:54:01,985
Okay.

498
00:54:03,016 --> 00:54:06,384
- Where would you like us to be?
- I don't know.

499
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:11,387
The bed. The bed would be nice.

500
00:54:14,774 --> 00:54:19,655
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- I don't know...

501
00:54:21,054 --> 00:54:25,774
Yes, lie down please.
Could you lie down please.

502
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:28,742
I think that
would make it even better.

503
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:34,975
I've always imagined this would be
a fabulous kiss.

504
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,132
Put your head down, please.

505
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,101
Now close your eyes,
and keep them closed.

506
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,416
Remember, this is my kiss.
You do nothing.

507
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:13,455
Was my imagination lousy?
Was it a blah kiss?

508
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:17,689
- It was a great kiss.
- I'm sorry, it was a blah kiss.

509
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:21,007
- It was a fabulous kiss.
- I'm sorry.

510
00:55:24,482 --> 00:55:30,489
Angel, now. Right now.

511
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,481
Will you show me everything?

512
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,522
Do everything to me?

513
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:47,403
Show me everything I can do to you.

514
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,849
Am I too greedy?

515
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:07,605
You must be greedy.
The bed is a selfish place.

516
00:56:07,754 --> 00:56:12,316
In it we seem to give only
so that we may receive.

517
00:56:13,354 --> 00:56:16,119
Is there enough I can give to you,

518
00:56:16,274 --> 00:56:19,005
so that you can give ecstasy to me?

519
00:56:24,152 --> 00:56:26,917
That we will have
to look for together.

520
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,595
Do you mind, Marie?

521
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:44,591
Marie? Do you mind? Please!

522
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:47,389
Gracias.

523
00:57:01,426 --> 00:57:02,791
Open.

524
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,258
No, please. I'm sorry.

525
00:57:41,418 --> 00:57:45,025
I'm not a virgin anymore.

526
01:00:47,546 --> 01:00:51,267
Ola? Si, diga me.

527
01:00:51,426 --> 01:00:57,957
Si, un momenta. Angel, the telephone.
He wants you.

528
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:11,473
- Ola. Catalina. Que tal?
- Hello.

529
01:01:11,622 --> 01:01:14,102
Hello.

530
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:20,269
- Gracias. Do you like it? - It's the
most beautiful thing in the world.

531
01:01:20,422 --> 01:01:24,391
I have to go to the bank.
Sign papers.

532
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,031
- I'll go with you.
- You will not.

533
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:38,182
You will enjoy your horse
and when I return tonight,

534
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:42,138
we will celebrate your horse and

535
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:46,824
the entering wine business. And...

536
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:54,500
I see here you're holding
several valuable items.

537
01:01:57,374 --> 01:02:01,618
1924, Rolls motor car and some art.

538
01:02:01,774 --> 01:02:04,141
Why do we take care of these as well?

539
01:02:31,888 --> 01:02:33,697
There you are gentlemen.

540
01:02:35,808 --> 01:02:36,775
Here.

541
01:02:40,008 --> 01:02:42,488
Come on!

542
01:02:46,206 --> 01:02:49,016
We did it, Angel! We did it, Angel!

543
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:54,375
- Angel, he go to your bed?
- No.

544
01:02:54,524 --> 01:02:57,926
- I think he go.
- No, Paloma.

545
01:02:58,084 --> 01:03:02,726
I went to his bed.
All right, enough talk. Out, out.

546
01:03:07,402 --> 01:03:11,123
Bitch! Bitch! American bitch!

547
01:03:11,282 --> 01:03:16,004
- Bitch! Damn it! [at me go!
- I got it.

548
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,569
Bitch. Let me go.

549
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,519
- Now what are we gonna do? - leave
her there. No like her anyway.

550
01:03:35,638 --> 01:03:40,326
Miss McGillvary? Come out, come out.

551
01:03:40,478 --> 01:03:43,446
Come out wherever you are.

552
01:03:50,436 --> 01:03:52,721
Catalina!

553
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:06,400
- OlÃ©, Paloma.
- OlÃ©. - I'm sorry.

554
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:09,522
We're going to have stop dancing
and get some rest.

555
01:04:11,232 --> 01:04:14,361
Horses and bulls ship out tomorrow.
And the following day I fight.

556
01:04:14,512 --> 01:04:17,161
- You do?
- Yes, and from the look of things,

557
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,199
your friend can't ?y.

558
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,074
So, everybody will stay here.

559
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,191
It's awful for him.
No one comes to see him.

560
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,747
- Can't they see the beauty in that?
- This is too different for them

561
01:05:25,898 --> 01:05:27,787
It's always the other way
with the killing.

562
01:05:33,338 --> 01:05:38,024
He should be in a beautiful ring with
thousands of people cheering him.

563
01:05:38,176 --> 01:05:41,146
Not here with a few people wondering
what he is.

564
01:05:54,294 --> 01:05:57,423
They want the killing man.
They want the blood.

565
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,895
Marie, go home. Go home, Marie.

566
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:21,932
Marie, please shut up.
Go home, go home.

567
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:24,739
How is the horse? Is he hurt?

568
01:06:24,888 --> 01:06:28,051
- Fine, fine.
- Are you sure?

569
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:31,018
- Take Marie home.
- What? Do what?

570
01:06:31,168 --> 01:06:35,649
The dog, Marie. Take her home.
I'm all light.

571
01:06:35,806 --> 01:06:40,937
- You're all light? Really?
- I'm fine.

572
01:06:42,246 --> 01:06:45,011
He's alive and I just don't care.

573
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:50,489
Mac, I know I sound cruel
but that's romantic.

574
01:06:51,524 --> 01:06:57,327
- It's not. - You don't care if he
can never make love to you again?

575
01:07:01,242 --> 01:07:02,403
No, I don't care.

576
01:07:03,442 --> 01:07:09,131
Mac, one time in your life.
That's going to be it?

577
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,801
- It looks like it may be.
- This is crazy.

578
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,679
- This really stinks.
- No...

579
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:30,125
It's all right. In a couple of weeks
he'll be as good as new.

580
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:33,405
Not really.

581
01:07:35,236 --> 01:07:39,958
All they said was he most probably
won't be able to...

582
01:07:40,116 --> 01:07:44,915
Probably. That's means
there's a chance.

583
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:47,998
That's a pretty strong probably.

584
01:07:49,354 --> 01:07:54,679
Okay. Forget about how you feel
for a minute. What about him?

585
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:58,075
Can you imagine what's going on
inside him right now?

586
01:07:58,232 --> 01:08:01,281
Do you see? Do you see?

587
01:08:01,432 --> 01:08:05,721
I can't. I'm just not gonna believe
what they say.

588
01:08:05,872 --> 01:08:09,716
- Okay, tiger. Okay.
- Okay, tiger.

589
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:12,316
I'm going to be one.

590
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:14,040
May I come in?

591
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:19,708
- Do you have a minute?
- I have a minute.

592
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:28,669
Now pay attention and concentrate
on what I'm about to say.

593
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:31,955
- Are you concentrating?
- I'm trying.

594
01:08:32,106 --> 01:08:36,031
All right.
Now give me your hand.

595
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:47,827
Will you marry me?

596
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:54,424
Pay attention.
I'm proposing.

597
01:08:55,462 --> 01:08:56,827
I will ask you again.

598
01:08:57,942 --> 01:09:00,832
Will you marry me?

599
01:09:00,982 --> 01:09:05,907
I would marry you in a minute, in
a second. But as I'm sure you know,

600
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,951
I've no light to. Not now.

601
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:14,264
- Because of...
- Yes, because of!

602
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:18,627
All right. Okay.

603
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:22,022
Consider this then.

604
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:26,788
You teach me everything you can do
with these horses...

605
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:33,024
and watch me... and grow to love me
more and more each day.

606
01:09:35,696 --> 01:09:40,384
And soon the predictions of the
dooms-day doctors is no longer true.

607
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:45,655
Then you can sweep me into your arms,
drag me to the altar

608
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:50,538
and then we can live
happily ever after.

609
01:09:52,932 --> 01:09:55,902
Can't we make a deal to do this?

610
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:01,294
Some of it, for sure.

611
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:04,021
I'll accept that for now.

612
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:12,094
Do you like the outfit?
Don't answer that.

613
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,617
I may never take it off.
That thing is going to work.

614
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:20,530
I guarantee you this.

615
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:34,370
Hello! Hello!

616
01:10:35,686 --> 01:10:38,610
- Excuse me.
- You calling me?

617
01:10:38,764 --> 01:10:43,531
Miss McGillvary told me
I'd find Catalina Terry.

618
01:10:43,684 --> 01:10:49,168
- And the winery. Are you she?
- Yeah, that's me, that's me.

619
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:53,407
That's me, that's me.
How do you do? I'm sorry.

620
01:10:53,562 --> 01:10:56,566
- That's okay.
- Who are you?

621
01:10:56,722 --> 01:11:01,410
- Robert Stewart. Pleased to meet ya.
- Nice to meet you. I...

622
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:03,403
I'm one of Miss McGillvary's
solicitorâ€™s.

623
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,564
- Attorney, solicitor?
- Oh yes, she told me about you.

624
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:12,409
Hey, you're handsome.
So handsome.

625
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,960
Are you gonna help me
to make a big company out of this?

626
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:17,722
I shall try my best.

627
01:11:18,758 --> 01:11:22,001
What do you wear under that thing?
Everybody jokes about that.

628
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:26,241
Aye. To know that, you must
get to know me much better.

629
01:11:26,396 --> 01:11:29,843
- What?
- To know me much better.

630
01:11:29,996 --> 01:11:32,044
Do you like virgins?

631
01:11:32,196 --> 01:11:37,041
- I don't understand.
- Virgins. Do you like virgins.

632
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:39,720
- Virgins?
- Yes.

633
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:42,445
I'm afraid I'm not
a connoisseur of

634
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:46,957
Are there connoisseurs of virgins?
How strange.

635
01:11:48,154 --> 01:11:52,521
Why won't tell me
what you have under that skirt?

636
01:11:52,672 --> 01:11:54,959
What is under your skirt?

637
01:11:55,112 --> 01:11:59,711
If we'll be friends, you won't call
this kilt a skirt any more. Clear?

638
01:11:59,712 --> 01:12:00,154
If we'll be friends, you won't call
this kilt a skirt any more. Clear?

639
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,881
What? What, tell me.

640
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:08,321
Don't call the kilt a skirt. It isn't
a skirt, it's a kilt. Is that clear?

641
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:11,076
Yes, very clear.
Absolutely.

642
01:12:21,748 --> 01:12:25,717
Eight days and that sulking,
pouting, little boy

643
01:12:25,866 --> 01:12:27,789
stays in his room like Scrooge.

644
01:12:27,946 --> 01:12:31,075
Put a thing, so I can put a thing.

645
01:12:32,746 --> 01:12:37,955
- It's not easy. - Sure it's easy.
- Put the best one.

646
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:41,472
Okay, let's see what you can do.

647
01:12:42,864 --> 01:12:45,470
Easy. I win.

648
01:12:46,902 --> 01:12:50,224
- No? - You win yes.

649
01:12:51,822 --> 01:12:55,747
- And now I'm going to go to bed
and cry. - let's take a walk.

650
01:12:57,422 --> 01:13:02,904
Me too. I go to cry.
Cry Angel.

651
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,908
Every night.
CW Angel.

652
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:14,068
No, really, Cotton.
I'd rather be in bed crying.

653
01:13:14,218 --> 01:13:19,588
- A very short walk.
- Very very short.

654
01:13:24,256 --> 01:13:28,466
I know. But you may be wanting
marriage because of this

655
01:13:28,616 --> 01:13:30,186
rather than in spite of it.

656
01:13:33,614 --> 01:13:36,458
That's pan of what I'm going
to go cry about.

657
01:13:36,614 --> 01:13:38,935
If you let me go to bed.

658
01:13:40,134 --> 01:13:43,820
As long as you understand,
then you're dismissed.

659
01:13:45,732 --> 01:13:49,134
- I love you, Cotton
- Me too.

660
01:13:53,412 --> 01:13:55,733
You were really a cowboy?

661
01:13:55,892 --> 01:14:00,100
I was until I got so big the horses
figured they were going to ride me.

662
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:04,573
Did you kiss your horse?
Like in the moving picture.

663
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,574
I kissed 'me better than anybody.

664
01:14:09,568 --> 01:14:14,813
I was a really good kisser.

665
01:14:31,044 --> 01:14:32,967
You wait.

666
01:15:19,236 --> 01:15:20,886
Basa, Paloma!

667
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:58,000
- Well? - It must be her.
She's not in her room.

668
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:01,199
Evita, get the men. Give them guns.
Get the guns. Now!

669
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:05,398
- Hurry. Now!
- Really, they stole her?

670
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:14,678
No key.

671
01:16:15,706 --> 01:16:19,074
- Mira, mira.
- The truck. Come on, Paloma.

672
01:16:23,986 --> 01:16:29,434
Paloma! Come on!
What are you waiting for?

673
01:16:48,902 --> 01:16:51,710
They was stolen her
because she's so rich

674
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:54,864
I hope so, Paloma.
I hope that's all it is.

675
01:17:08,258 --> 01:17:10,226
Why are you doing this to me?

676
01:17:10,378 --> 01:17:13,461
You still have your virginity,
I want it.

677
01:17:13,616 --> 01:17:17,701
- I don't have it anymore.
- Unit's sad for me.

678
01:17:17,856 --> 01:17:20,860
But no matter. I want you
to live with me forever.

679
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:25,542
- No. - I take you now,
like my father took my mother. - No.

680
01:17:33,374 --> 01:17:35,695
Cotton! Cotton!

681
01:17:44,012 --> 01:17:45,013
Oh, yes.

682
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:53,531
Oh yes, Cotton! Thank you.

683
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:00,649
Oh, no! No, Cotton.

684
01:18:29,764 --> 01:18:30,731
<i>You, S...</i>

685
01:18:35,202 --> 01:18:38,684
My sheik.
Your thought is very beautiful.

686
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:45,010
And I'm very ?attered.
But I'm in love.

687
01:18:45,162 --> 01:18:47,208
Down there I'm in love.

688
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,443
I'm sorry, but I too have my needs.

689
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:57,170
It's a chauvinistic world.
What I do is correct.

690
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:01,482
I know you have your need.
We all do.

691
01:19:01,638 --> 01:19:06,519
But I'm very ?attered
that you consider me one of yours.

692
01:19:06,678 --> 01:19:10,317
But I must be selfish
and think of myself first.

693
01:19:11,836 --> 01:19:12,997
No, no.

694
01:19:13,156 --> 01:19:17,320
I say he was stolen you
because you so rich.

695
01:19:17,476 --> 01:19:22,275
No, he was stolen me
because I so cute!

696
01:19:25,154 --> 01:19:26,804
You know, Angel walk.

697
01:19:31,874 --> 01:19:33,601
Alta, Marie.

698
01:19:35,392 --> 01:19:36,598
Alta, Marie.

699
01:19:38,432 --> 01:19:40,321
You should come out into the sun

700
01:19:40,472 --> 01:19:42,839
Maybe look around. Watch me ride.

701
01:19:42,992 --> 01:19:45,800
You know you're days and days behind
in your loving me.

702
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:50,114
Thank you. But Marie and I
are learning new tricks.

703
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:51,715
Hello, Marie.

704
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:57,671
As you wish. I brought you some more
sweet, little companions.

705
01:19:58,548 --> 01:19:59,747
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

706
01:19:59,748 --> 01:20:02,638
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

707
01:20:15,826 --> 01:20:19,874
- Did the lovebirds send you my
message? - I got your message.

708
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,261
Oh, I did it!

709
01:21:58,928 --> 01:22:03,172
Today he let me hug him
and he even hugged me back.

710
01:22:04,926 --> 01:22:07,896
And now he's back in his room
like a hermit.

711
01:22:08,046 --> 01:22:10,253
A hug beats a kick in a butt.

712
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:14,171
And Rome wasn't built in a day.
I know.

713
01:22:14,326 --> 01:22:16,691
Who said that? I never said that.

714
01:22:25,724 --> 01:22:31,047
- Do you want I give you some more
hot chocolate. - Oh, yes, please.

715
01:22:31,202 --> 01:22:35,093
- Put two spoons of patience it.
- Of what?

716
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:39,165
- Never mind.
- Do you want I give you some too?

717
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,722
Okay, goodnight everybody.
I'm going to bed.

718
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,201
Why do you go to bed so early?

719
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:50,967
No, Paloma.
For me it's very very late. Night.

720
01:22:51,118 --> 01:22:54,042
- Good night.
- Good night.

721
01:23:03,796 --> 01:23:06,322
Thank you for taking them off first.

722
01:23:11,396 --> 01:23:14,443
For you, it's a pleasure, Catalina.

723
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:20,363
Fantastic. I can't believe
we are doing this.

724
01:23:20,514 --> 01:23:24,838
I can't believe I am happy
we are doing this, God.

725
01:23:26,392 --> 01:23:30,363
But to do it properly, you're going
to have to take off your clothes.

726
01:23:34,512 --> 01:23:40,279
Listen, why don't you do it for me?

727
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:43,036
- Take your clothes off, you mean?
- Yes.

728
01:23:49,148 --> 01:23:53,676
I hope you think I am as beautiful
with my clothes off

729
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:55,193
as I think you are.

730
01:24:14,384 --> 01:24:16,546
This is unbelievable.

731
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:22,588
I love it. And the hurt,
I love the hurt.

732
01:24:22,744 --> 01:24:24,551
- You do?
- Yes.

733
01:24:26,902 --> 01:24:31,624
- Do you love me?
- I do.

734
01:24:31,782 --> 01:24:34,786
Right now,
I really do love you.

735
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:39,343
I know light now you love me.
And listen,

736
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:43,983
if I want, I want your love,
we'd better not stop doing this.

737
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:49,224
That would be the most wonderful way
to spend forever.

738
01:24:49,378 --> 01:24:55,738
I don't think I'm up to it. I'm not
a freak. I can still hold you.

739
01:25:24,892 --> 01:25:27,372
You're a hard man to seduce.

740
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:38,340
Oh, listen Angel.

741
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:43,656
We made a deal for over 300.000 bottles to the United
States.

742
01:25:44,888 --> 01:25:50,372
We ship them out next week. I mean,
next month. Can you believe it?

743
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:52,257
It's fantastic.

744
01:25:56,486 --> 01:25:58,454
Listen, Catalina.

745
01:25:58,606 --> 01:26:03,976
I've the feeling you haven't kept me
just to show me your sales report.

746
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:08,648
No, as a matter of fact, I haven't.

747
01:26:08,804 --> 01:26:13,093
Mac asked me to keep you away
from the ling for awhile today.

748
01:26:13,244 --> 01:26:16,532
I think I've done very well.

749
01:26:16,684 --> 01:26:19,891
Why would she want me
away from the ring?

750
01:28:14,704 --> 01:28:17,353
I've done this to get
your undivided attention

751
01:28:17,502 --> 01:28:19,869
to tell you
I will see you at sunrise.

752
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,464
You do remember sunrise, don't you?

753
01:28:38,778 --> 01:28:44,421
This better work. I sure wanna be
the Duchess of Piores.

754
01:28:44,578 --> 01:28:48,902
I'm sorry Paloma,
but if this works my way,

755
01:28:49,058 --> 01:28:51,821
I promise I'll find you a lover.

756
01:28:51,976 --> 01:28:57,619
I'll give him to you.
Tonight be good night.

757
01:28:57,776 --> 01:29:01,497
Angel be a man for you.

758
01:29:48,248 --> 01:29:49,896
Happy sunrise.

759
01:29:50,046 --> 01:29:54,176
- Mac, this is not going to work.
- Hold it, right there. Hold it.

760
01:29:56,286 --> 01:29:58,368
Damn. Come on Marie.

761
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:02,085
Out you go. He's mine now.
Come on. Out you go.

762
01:30:04,884 --> 01:30:08,809
Hats are bad luck on beds.
You ought to know better than that.

763
01:30:08,964 --> 01:30:14,412
Did I ride the horse marvellously?
Even more marvellously than you?

764
01:30:14,562 --> 01:30:16,007
I did, didn't I?

765
01:30:19,082 --> 01:30:22,848
All right. Off the bed.
Come on. Off the bed.

766
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:26,322
- What you doing? - Off the bed.
- What you doing?

767
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,051
Come on.

768
01:30:38,358 --> 01:30:41,009
That's not the way
we did it last time?

769
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:43,525
But then I was a little girl.

770
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:51,083
Now I am a woman.
Do you wanna taste my blood?

771
01:31:01,634 --> 01:31:06,481
Damn you. Don't do this to me.

772
01:31:18,752 --> 01:31:23,312
Don't take it out on me just because
you got cute with the damn bull.

773
01:31:34,548 --> 01:31:38,030
This is a very strange vigil
we all seemed to have gathered for.

774
01:31:38,188 --> 01:31:43,797
- What are we here to do?
- We're here to help Angel and Mac.

775
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:51,069
We cannot help Angel.
Angel has to be a man.

776
01:31:51,226 --> 01:31:53,627
Is no problem

777
01:32:00,344 --> 01:32:05,987
You said that we never found ecstasy.
That it was like quicksilver,

778
01:32:06,144 --> 01:32:08,349
always promising next time.

779
01:32:11,142 --> 01:32:15,545
Angel, I want ecstasy.

780
01:32:17,182 --> 01:32:20,866
- Let's find it.
- Make me whole again.

781
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:25,503
- I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
- Make me whole again.

782
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,144
I guaranteed it.

783
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:04,777
Fourteen. Shame on you.

784
01:33:04,934 --> 01:33:09,460
Was she wild then?
Did she scratch you?

785
01:33:09,612 --> 01:33:12,695
Long wicked scratches?

786
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:19,055
She did, didn't she?
And you loved it.

787
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:24,621
I think this seems like a perfect
time to tell you that I love you.

788
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:30,776
And an equally perfect time for you
to tell me the same.

789
01:33:30,928 --> 01:33:36,378
I do. I'm sure.
Beyond your wildest dreams.

790
01:33:37,808 --> 01:33:42,414
Well, my dreams take me
beyond infinity.

791
01:33:42,566 --> 01:33:46,093
What love you must have for me.

792
01:33:59,084 --> 01:34:00,848
I guaranteed it.

793
01:34:29,358 --> 01:34:33,044
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

794
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:14,148
Oh, look!

795
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:19,786
X. I was right.

796
01:38:03,562 --> 01:38:08,566
Angel. Angel, my foot is cramped.

797
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,724
Angel, give me back my foot, please.

798
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:18,043
Oh, God. I'm sorry. Thank you.
