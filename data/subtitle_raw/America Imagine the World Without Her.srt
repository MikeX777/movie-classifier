66
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,944
It allows you to write the
script of your own life.

67
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,679
A chapter of my script
was making the film 2016.

68
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,879
It surprised Hollywood and the
media by becoming a runaway hit.

69
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,266
It became the number two political
documentary film of all time.

70
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,919
In the film I made three predictions.

71
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,119
The federal government
would grow bigger

72
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,839
as America's role in the
world grows smaller.

73
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,199
Under President Obama,
the national debt would double.

74
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,319
This administration would
undermine our allies

75
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,909
and strengthen our enemies.

76
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,101
Seeing these predictions come true,
I'm scared for the future of America.

77
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,022
But I believe we can be strong again
unless we choose another path.

78
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,039
A century and a half ago,
a young Abraham Lincoln

79
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,902
issued a prophetic warning.

80
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,719
Shall we expect some
transatlantic military giant

81
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,879
to step the ocean and
crush us with a blow?

82
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,999
Never. All the armies of Europe,
Asia and Africa combined

83
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,279
with a Bonaparte for a commander

84
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,559

a drink from the Ohio.

85
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,982
At what point then, is the
approach of danger to be expected?

86
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,799
I answer that if it ever reach us,
it must spring up from amongst us.

87
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,468
It cannot come from abroad.

88
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,399
If destruction be our lot,

89
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,119
then we ourselves must be
the author and finisher of it.

90
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,199
As a nation of freemen,

91
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,589
we must live throughout
all time or die by suicide.

D'SOUZA: How do you convince a great
nation to author its own destruction?

93
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,119

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,319
A sadness. For me,
it's just a great sadness.

128

131

you move back to Mexico?"

I don't have to. I'm in Mexico.

And like I tell my Chicano students,

136
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,599

we'll still be here, like the Indians.

D'SOUZA: So to put it biblically,
you are in America but not of America.

at the University of New Mexico.

141
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,182
He's a leading representative of a movement
trying to reclaim Mexico's lost lands.

142
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,919
Did the United States steal half
of Mexico in the Mexican War?

143
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,479
Yes, and the wealth of those areas.
California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas,

144
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,199
the oil, the minerals,

145
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,359
would have made Mexico
a premier economic power,

146
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,391
like it's becoming now.

147
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,839
When I went one time with my father
to Mexico to visit relatives,

148
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,879
we were in an old classroom

149
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,679
and they had a map of North
America up in the classroom.

150
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,759
And it had the area that's
the American Southwest

151
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,239
from Texas to California
cross-thatched

152
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,519
with the colors of Mexico
and the United States,

153
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,226
and they had named that area
provincias perdidas, lost provinces.

154
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,559
They have killed us, beat us,

155

raped us and robbed us.

160

161
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,679
DYSON: Well, obviously as
a black person in America,

162
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,039
it's, um, a part of the
wretched history of this nation

163
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,799
that my foremothers and forefathers
were not seen as fully human.

164

Doesn't that say something

I would not deny at all that American
has made enormous progress.

Are we there yet? No.

170
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,759
America doesn't want to confront
the vicious inequalities

171

00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,079
We can say thievery was a critical element
to the expansion of American empire

174
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,750
and the establishment of
the American way of life.

175
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,639
D'SOUZA: 150 years ago
at the height of slavery,

176
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,879
another man made an even more
passionate indictment of America.

177
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,663
The American slave,
what is your 4th of July?

178
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,144
I answer a day that reveals to him
more than all other days in a year,

179
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,030
a gross injustice.

180
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,199
Your celebration is a sham.

181
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,479
You profess to believe that of
one blood God made all nations

182
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,919
and hath commanded all men
everywhere to love one another.

183
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,959
Yet, you notoriously hate

184
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,839
and glory in your hatred all men whose
skin are not colored like your own.

185
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,479
D'SOUZA: Meet Frederick Douglass.

186
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,159
Born a slave, he escaped to freedom

187
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,784
and became a champion of
the antislavery movement.

188
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,439
DOUGLASS: You can bare your bosom
to the storm of British artillery

189
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,559
to throw off a three-penny tax on tea

190
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,799
and yet wring the last
hard-earned farthing

191
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,390
from the grasp of the black
laborers of your country.

192
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,199
There is not a nation on the earth

193
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,679
guilty of practices more shocking

194
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,719
and bloody

195
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,062
than are the people of the United
States, than on this 4th of July.

196
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,319
BILL AYERS: We like to think of
ourselves as a peace-loving people.

197
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
If they said, "We're going in for the
oil," we'd say, "No, don't do it."

198
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,382
But instead they say,
"We're going in for democracy."

199
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,919
Has the United States been a force
for good or ill in the world?

200
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,719
For the people we conquer,

201
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,390
the Vietnamese, we killed
a couple million of them,

202
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,427
not a force for good.

203
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,119
D'SOUZA: MIT professor Noam Chomsky
is a leading critic of American imperialism.

204
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,439
There's a reason why most of the
world regards the United States

205
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,159
as a predatory colonial power.

206
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,079
We overthrew the democratic
government of Guatemala in 1954,

207
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,399
Iran in 1953, Cuba in 1961.

208
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,310
Then Brazil, Chile,
Uruguay, Argentina,

209
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,667
on through the world.
It's not a pretty record.

210
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,831
(SHOUTING)

211
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,479
We are the 99%!

212
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,719
Whose street? Our street!
Occupy Wall Street!

213
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,759
We've never had anything
like this in this country

214
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,239
where we take on
economic issues like this.

215
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,719
If you want money, after you get
that million, you want a billion.

216
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,479
After you get a billion, you want a trillion.
After you get a trillion, you want a zillion.

217
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,262
There is no end. There is no line.

218
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,639
D'SOUZA: The charge against capitalism
is that greedy, selfish business owners

219
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,024
steal from people.

220
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,879
They create gross inequality by
depriving people of their fair share.

221
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,999
OBAMA: And it's only right that we ask
everyone to pay their fair share.

222
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,959
Asking everyone to
pay their fair share.

223
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,159
Pay their fair share.

224
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,559
There is nobody in this country
who got rich on his own.

225
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,759
Nobody.

226
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,399
You built a factory out there.
Good for you.

227
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,679
But I want to be clear,
you moved your goods

228
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,879
to market on the roads
the rest of us paid for.

229
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,599
You hired workers the rest
of us paid to educate.

230
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,279
You were safe in your factory

231
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,146
because of police forces and fire
forces that the rest of us paid for.

232
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,719
D'SOUZA: It doesn't matter
whether you're making profits

233
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,559
from a hot dog stand in Times Square

234
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,662
or if you're the biggest
company on NASDAQ,

235
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,586
capitalists are under fire.

236
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,959
MOORE: Until we change the system,
and let's use the C word here.

237
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,039
We're talking about capitalism.

238
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,279
If it's a more comfortable
word for you, greed.

239
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,559
That's just another word for it.

240
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,799
This ultimately has to change.

241
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,959
How much more are you
going to make them suffer?

242
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,551
Because some day they're
not gonna take it anymore.

243
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,239
D'SOUZA: These are the
indictments against America.

244
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,039
We stole the country from
the Native Americans.

245
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,799
We took half of Mexico
in the Mexican War.

246
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,359
We stole the labor of
the African Americans.

247
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,464
And today our foreign policy and our
free market system are forms of theft.

248
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,599
These indictments developed separately
and each has been around for a long time.

249
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,119
But now they've come together in a
single narrative of American shame.

250
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,879
One professor pulled
this narrative together.

251
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,519
His name is Howard Zinn.

252
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,599
ZINN: I prefer to try to tell the
story of the discovery of America

253
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,679
from the viewpoint of the Arawaks.

254
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,959
Of the Constitution from the
standpoint of the slaves.

255
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,221
Of Andrew Jackson as
seen by the Cherokees.

256
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,439
D'SOUZA: Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck grew up in the same

257
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,919
South Boston neighborhood as Zinn.

258
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,919
They gave him a nice plug in
their movie Good Will Hunting.

259
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,679
You want to read a real history book,

260
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,759
read Howard Zion's People's
History of the United States.

261
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,639
That book will knock you on your ass.

262
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,519
D'SOUZA: Zion's book has made
him quite the celebrity.

263
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,079
What I didn't realize is that
from the very beginning,

264
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,159
from when Columbus met the Arawaks,

265
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,184
there was... It was just nonstop, um,

266
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,519
violence and, uh, (EXHALING)
and, uh, just taking over.

267
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,479
They're bullying people and
taking over their resources.

268
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,479
D'SOUZA: Howard Zinn is the most influential
historian of the past 50 years.

269
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,839
His book has sold over
two million copies,

270
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,799
becoming required reading in most
colleges and many high schools.

271
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,319
Even Tony Soprano's
kid had to read it.

272
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,839
His history teacher, Mr. Cushman,

273
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,119
is teaching your son that if
Columbus was alive today,

274
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,679
he would go on trial for
crimes against humanity,

275
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,621
like Milošević in, you know, Europe.

276
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,599
Your teacher said that?

277
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,199
It's not just my teacher.
It's the truth.

278
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,345
It's in my history book.

279
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,501
(GUN FIRING)

280
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,787
D'SOUZA: This is the new
story of American shame.

281
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,199
Are our lives,
innocent on the surface,

282
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,986
part of a ruthless engine of
looting, exploitation and murder?

283
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,559
It's a powerful critique.

284
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,709
We can't just dismiss it with chants
of liberty, freedom, rah, rah, rah.

285
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,759
The critics are raising the
primary question of justice.

286
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,510
ALL:
...with liberty and justice for all.

287
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,639
D'SOUZA:
Read the Declaration of independence.

288
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,786
It's a cry against injustice.

289
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,790
For the American founders, liberty
was the solution to that injustice.

290
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,839
This is not just an attack on the 1%.

291
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,119
It's an attack on all of us.

292
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,239
We are a nation of
immigrants and settlers.

293
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,547
And we are the ones
accused of these crimes.

294
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,429
If these things are true,
something has to be done about them.

295
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,665
(DOORBELL RINGING)

296
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,679
- There he is.
- How's it going?

297
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,239
- Good. Come on in.
- Good to see you.

298
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,839
- Been a while, hasn't it?
- It has been.

299
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,719
Reagan had called the Soviet Union,
you remember, an evil empire.

300
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,679
- Yeah.
- And the Soviet Union has dissolved.

301
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,599
So, who's the new evil empire?

302
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,839
Well, you're sitting in it.

303
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,239
D'SOUZA: One of the most
vocal critics of America

304
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,599
is Professor Ward Churchill.

305
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,879
He gained notoriety right after 9/11

306
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,799
by suggesting some of the people
in the World Trade Center

307
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,079
were like Nazi war criminals
and deserved what they got.

308
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,279
If the US had the
atomic bomb earlier,

309
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,279
chances are pretty good it would
have dropped it on Nazi Germany,

310
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,279
and certainly, for a Jew,
that would be a good idea

311
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,399
because to destroy an evil
regime is a good thing.

312
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,839
Yeah.

313
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,987
So if you could drop a bomb on the
United States, would you do it?

314
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,387
Well, if it would be justifiable

315
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,679
in the context you just described,

316
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,679
then by the same logic,
it would be justifiable here.

317
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,879
It's not one set of rules
for everybody else

318
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,060
and another set of rules
for the United States.

319
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,226
D'SOUZA: That is American suicide.

320
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,759
But there is an alternative remedy
for this theft and injustice.

321
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,519
Starting today, we must pick
ourselves up, dust ourselves off,

322
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,064
and begin again the work
of remaking America.

323
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,679
D'SOUZA: To remake America

324
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,463
you have to unmake the
America that's here now.

325
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,079
You are about to witness
the very exciting story

326
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,039
of a city and its people.

327
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,279
It is the story of a city
seeking new horizons.

328
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,462
Yes, Detroit is enjoying
its finest hour.

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,359
D'SOUZA: Obama's remaking
involves economic redistribution

330
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,159
never before imagined.

331
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,184
It's aimed at returning
centuries of stolen goods.

332
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,279
Detroit was once the
richest city in the world,

333
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,759
the pinnacle of America.

334
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,910
If America goes the way of Detroit,
that would be another kind of suicide.

335
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,359
But is suicide the price
we must pay for justice?

336
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,384
If our wealth is stolen,
then we must give it back.

337
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,119
So, is America guilty as charged?

338
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,984
It depends on whether the story
of American shame is true or not.

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,559

America 30 years ago.

people on the campus

repeat the Zinn narrative
of American shame,

343
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,180
I know they haven't been
told the whole story.

344
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,519
Is Howard Zinn a real historian?

345
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,759
No, Howard Zinn is not
a real historian.

346
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,399
He constantly has
misstatements of fact.

347
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,319
More than misstatements,
actual proven untruths,

348
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,944
and he doesn't care
that it's inaccurate.

349
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,079
D'SOUZA: Professor Ron Radosh is a
leading scholar of American radicalism

350
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,279
and a contemporary of Howard Zinn.

351
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,719
Now, you used to be a member
of the US Communist Party.

352
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,559
Right, I left it because I
realized that the ideology

353
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,799
and the practice had no
relation to American reality.

354
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,159
Howard Zinn left because it
was not revolutionary enough.

355
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,039
What he does is try
to create a glossary

356
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,879
of radical heroes who the new movement
he wants to build should emulate.

357
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,799
That's why he's writing this book.

358
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,479
He was writing to try and inspire a
social movement among young people

359
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,879
who would act as revolutionaries.

360
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,821
That's his purpose, not history.

361
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,519
I got into history with a very,
sort of, modest objective.

362
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,541
Uh, I wanted to change the world.

363
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,359
If you read his book,

364
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,799
America is the single most
oppressive nation in the world.

365
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,039
America is intrinsically evil.

366
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,199
He wants us to understand
how bad America is.

367
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,759
And then, we will join him in creating
a new social revolutionary movement.

a twisted picture of America,

a French aristocrat who traveled
through America in 1831

373
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,981
and wrote the classic book
Democracy in America.

Tocqueville witnessed
America first-hand.

He saw the founding

very entrepreneurial.

D'SOUZA: Tocqueville witnessed
the importance of Christianity.

388
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,719
He saw faith shaping not
only people's inner life,

389
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,707
but also their political life.

390
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:26,666
He wrote, "Religion must be regarded
as the first of their political institutions.

391
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,959
"When a private individual
meditates an undertaking,

392
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,079
"he never thinks of soliciting the
cooperation of the government.

"Rather, he does it himself or

- God bless you.

D'SOUZA: "In the end, the sum
of these private undertakings

396
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,309
"far exceeds all that the
government could have done."

397
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,791
Now, Tocqueville did recognize
the things that Zinn talks about.

398
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,719
At one point, Tocqueville stood
on the Ohio-Kentucky border.

399
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,919
He looked north and he
saw industrious Ohio.

400
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,181
He looked south and
he saw idle Kentucky.

401
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,279
"On both sides," he commented,
"the soil is equally fertile.

"The situation just as favorable."

So what explained the difference?

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,959
"Slavery," Tocqueville
said, "degrades work.

without a spirit of enterprise.

When Tocqueville saw slavery,

418
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,199
when he saw the treatment
of the Native Americans,

419
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,870
he knew none of this
was uniquely American.

420

In fact, it was part of a
universal conquest ethic.

421
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,239
Most countries are
founded in conquest.

422
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,343

and more conquest.

423
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,239
Look at Britain.

424
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,279
Before becoming an empire,
it was conquered

425
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,719
by the Norman kings of France
and earlier by the Romans.

426
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,879
Before the British came,
India was invaded by the Persians,

427
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,711
the Mongols, the Afghans,
the Arabs and Alexander the Great.

428
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,039
Conquest was how wealth was acquired.

429
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,301
Not through entrepreneurship,
invention or business.

430
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,585
Historically, every culture has despised
entrepreneurs and merchants.

431
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,439
In India, we have the caste system.

432
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,199
Who's at the top?
The Brahmin or priest.

433
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,631
The entrepreneur is one
step from the bottom.

434
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,559
The Islamic historian Ibn Khaldūn

435
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:33,300
says that looting is morally preferable
to entrepreneurship or trade.

436
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,639
Why? Because looting is more manly.

437
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,743
In looting, you have to beat the guy
in open combat to take his stuff.

438
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,559
America is based on a different idea.

439
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,788
The idea of acquiring wealth not
by taking it from someone else.

440
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,479
Instead, wealth can be created

441
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,741
through innovation,
entrepreneurship and trade.

442
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,906
Let's take a look at Manhattan.

443
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,119
Reportedly in 1626,

444
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,986
Native Americans sold Manhattan to
the Dutch for $700 in today's money.

445
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,628
There's land all over the world
now that you can buy for $700.

446
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,990
But when the Dutch bought
Manhattan, there was no Manhattan.

447
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,599
Prices are astronomical today

448
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,782
because of what's been built
over the past 300 years.

449
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,959
Manhattan is the creation
of the people who built it,

450
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,823
not the original
inhabitants who sold it.

451
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,028
Manhattan represents the new
American ethic of wealth creation.

452
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,024
An alternative to conquest.

453
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,140
It's time to respond to Zion's
story of American shame.

454
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,188
Did America steal the country
from the Native Americans?

455
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,159
Much of this critique
focuses on Columbus

456
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,119
and the actions of the
Spanish conquistadors.

457
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,079
But Columbus never even
landed in America.

458
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,799
And the actions of the Spanish,

459
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,310
- that was 150 years before America.

the sins of the Spanish

461

and the Portuguese and
Great Britain and France.

462
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,748
What about all the broken
treaties since 1776?

463
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,279
Well, the very idea of a treaty is a
departure from the conquest ethic.

464
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,020
The conquest ethic was very
simple, you win, I lose.

465
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,199
This is not a defense of relocation

466
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,319
or the way the Native
Americans have been treated.

467
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,559
Some restitution is due.

468
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,719
And some has been made.

469
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,199
In the case of the Black Hills,
American courts acknowledge

470
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,919
the land was taken in violation
of the Laramie Treaty of 1868.

471
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,706
$1 billion, fair market value of the
land plus interest, has been set aside.

472
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,385
But the Sioux have rejected it.
They want the land.

473
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,428
But is it their land?

474
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,319
In the late 1700s, the Sioux took
that land from the Cheyenne,

475
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,103
who had earlier pushed out
the Kiowa and the Arapaho.

476
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,479
Land possession is
part of a long history

477
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,719
in which the stronger Native American
tribes displaced weaker ones.

478
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,919
The Native Americans, too,
subscribe to the conquest ethic.

479
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,919
But what about the
charge of genocide?

480
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,319
In the two centuries after Columbus,

481
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,079
the Native American
population declined by 80%.

482
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,359
But it wasn't due to warfare.

483
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,519
Rather, as historian William
McNeill points out,

484
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,079
they contracted diseases,

485
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,239
measles, typhus, smallpox,
cholera and malaria,

486
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,942
to which they had no immunities.

487
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,079
Now, this is tragedy on a grand
scale, but it's not genocide

488
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,671
because genocide implies an
intention to wipe out a people.

489
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,039
Just a century and a half earlier,

490
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,639
one-third of the population
of Europe was wiped out

491
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,919
by a series of bubonic
and pneumonic plagues.

492
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,239
Those plagues came from Asia,
and the Europeans had no immunities.

493
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,988
We don't call that genocide.

494
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,879
I understand the pain of
Charmaine White Face and others

495
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,439
over the loss of an old way of life,

496
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,919
but the Native Americans, if they
wanted, can return to that way.

497
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,559
Instead, they have exercised the
right of tribal self-government

498
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,559
and many have chosen
to build resorts, casinos

499
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,262
and other entrepreneurial businesses.

500
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,186
Did America steal half of
Mexico in the Mexican War?

501
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,279
It seems cruel.

502
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,079
We took the land of these Mexicans

503
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,279
and now we won't even
allow them to come back

504
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,268
and work as laborers on land
that used to be theirs.

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,465
I asked Texas Senator Ted Cruz
what started the Mexican War.

506
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,719
What prompted the Texas Revolution,

507
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,439
the Texians, who were
part of Mexico at the time.

508
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,319
General Santa Anna,
who was the dictator in Mexico,

509
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,599
began stripping away
the rights of Texians.

510
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,999
And indeed, they began to revolt to
protect their freedom and independence.

511
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,159
And so the Texians
fought a revolution,

512
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,879
just like our founding
fathers in America did,

513
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,959
and won their
independence from Mexico.

514
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,199
D'SOUZA:
Texas joined the American union,

515
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,144
and its border dispute with Mexico
precipitated the Mexican War.

516
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,479
America won that war.

517
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,599
As a result, American
troops were in Mexico City.

518
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,559
We took all of Mexico.

519
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,106
Then we retired its debt and
gave half the country back.

520
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,799
The people who ended up on the
American side of the border

521
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,423
were made American citizens.

522
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,199
Temo Muniz is a law student
active in Hispanic politics.

523
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,639
Would you consider
yourself Mexican American?

524
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,519
Mexican is the adjective.

525
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,079
American is the noun.

526
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,639
I am a proud Texan born and raised.

527
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,559
I'm an American of Mexican heritage.

528
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,199
Do you believe in the American dream?

529
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,999
Definitely. I've seen it first-hand.

530
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,639
My dad was a shepherd boy

531
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,919
from the mountains of
San Luis Potosí Mexico.

532
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,279
He pretty much bootstrapped
his way to building

533
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,959
one of the largest manufacturing
companies in his industry sector.

534
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,559
Like I said, we started from
the bottom. We had, uh, nothing.

535
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,999
Uh, dumpster diving to sell
things, to resell things.

536
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,439
Selling chips at the park at the
age of six. Collecting cans.

537
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,199
Unloading cotton bales
at the age of 13.

538
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,119
So, I've witnessed it. I've lived it.
And I know the American dream is alive.

539
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,279
What is your American dream?

540
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,759
Well, I'm still in search of it.

541
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,519
I'm in law school right now.

542
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,239
And I hope to really be an
influence to my community.

543
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,959
We're cut from the same cloth as any
American who has a pioneer spirit.

544
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,599
What would your life be like
today if you were in Mexico?

545
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,959
If we had the same
American dream in Mexico,

546
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,279
we'd probably be extorted
by the cartel kingpins.

547
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,759
Asking us for 10%, 20%
of the fruits of our labor.

548
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,199
We wouldn't even have the
natural right to bear arms

549
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,399
to defend ourselves
against the cartels.

550
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,639
It's hard to build any kind of dream
when you're living under tyranny.

551
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,639
I've heard of las provincias
perdidas, the lost provinces.

552
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,359
The truth of the matter, Dinesh,
is that we don't care about that.

553
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,439
We're here in America.
We're building up the American dream.

554
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,279
We're successful.
We've tasted freedom and liberty.

555
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,839
We're not going back.

556
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,159
What would you do if
the American Southwest

557
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,119
were somehow to be
returned to Mexico?

558
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,159
Uh, I'd be moving to Minneapolis.

559
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,239
So you'd want to stay in America?

560
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,944
America is where I was born and
Texas is where I'm gonna die.

561
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,159
D'SOUZA: And he's not alone.

562
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,519
How long have you been in
border control law enforcement?

563
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,839
Dinesh, I was a border patrol agent
on the border for 26-plus years.

564
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,519
Now, how many people
would you say in a year

565
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,079
surreptitiously cross the border?

566
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,039
Probably in the millions.

567
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,039
And these are people obviously crossing
from the United States into Mexico.

568
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,919
No, they're people crossing from
Mexico into the United States. Yes.

569
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,359
But don't you have Mexican Americans

570
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,919
who are trying to cross back
into their old country?

571
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,039
Uh, I've never seen one illegally try
and cross back into Mexico, no, never.

572
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,559
They prefer it here?

573
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,421
Obviously.

574
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,559
D'SOUZA: I wonder how many
people in Mexico today

575
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,389
wish the United States
had kept all of Mexico.

576
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,239
The enslavement of African
Americans was theft.

577
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,669
Theft of life and labor.

578
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,719
Were the American founders hypocrites in
affirming that all men are created equal

579
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,141
while approving a constitution
that allowed slavery to continue?

580
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,919
This was debated by the
Republican Abraham Lincoln

581
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,622
and his Democratic opponent.

582
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,119
So if you desire Negro citizenship,

583
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,999
if you desire to let them move into our
state to settle with the white man,

584
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,839
then by all means, support Mr. Lincoln
and the black Republican party

585
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,719
who are for Negro citizenship.

586
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,785
(AUDIENCE BOOING)

587
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,426
The authors of that notable instrument
intended to include all men.

588
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,319
They did not intend to declare
all men equal in all respects.

589
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,959
They did not mean to say
that all were equal in color,

590
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,861
size, intellect, moral
developments or social capacity.

591
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,119
They define with
tolerable distinctness

592
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,064
in what respect they did
consider all men created equal.

593
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,839
Equal in certain inalienable rights.

594
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,068
Among which are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

595
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,879
They did not mean to
assert the obvious untruth

596
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,439
that all were then actually
enjoying this equality.

597
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,941
Nor yet that they were about to
confer them immediately upon them.

598
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,519
They simply meant
to declare the right,

599
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,182
so that the enforcement of it might follow
as fast as circumstances should permit.

600
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,399
D'SOUZA:
Lincoln recognized that the founders

601
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,519
could not have outlawed slavery
and still had a union.

602
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,399
No Southern state would
have joined such a union

603
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,467
and slavery might have
lasted much longer.

604
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,359
Earlier in his career,
Frederick Douglass

605
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,039
had called Lincoln the
white man's president.

606
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,119
There was a movement in America
supported by many blacks

607
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,399
and even by Lincoln to
relocate blacks to Africa.

608
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,239
But meeting Lincoln restored
Douglass' faith in America.

609
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,559
Douglass condemned that movement.

610
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,919
He didn't want to leave America,
nor did he want to destroy America.

611
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,879
He wanted to participate in America.

612
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,039
He wanted to make this
country his home.

613
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,788
Now, take the Constitution.

614
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,839
According to its plain reading,

615
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:10,399
I defy the presentation of a
single proslavery clause in it.

616
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,599
On the other hand, it will be found
to contain principles and purposes

617
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,304
entirely hostile to the
existence of slavery.

618
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,742
I do not despair at this country.

619
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,239
There are forces in operation

620
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,548
which must inevitably work
the downfall of slavery.

621
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,984
D'SOUZA: For the first time in history,
a great war was fought to end slavery.

622
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,306
300,000 Northern soldiers
died in that war.

623
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,919
They died to secure for the slaves

624
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,024
a freedom that the slaves were not in
the position to secure for themselves.

625
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,343
Even the Civil Rights Movement was not
a break with the American founding.

626
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,949
In a sense, we've come to our
nation's capital to cash a check.

627
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,861
When the architects of our republic

628
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,959
wrote the magnificent
words of the Constitution

629
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,027
and the Declaration of independence,

630
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,543
they were signing a promissory note

631
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,429
To which every American
was to fall heir.

632
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,599
D'SOUZA: Where did Martin Luther
King get his promissory note?

633
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,439
Not from the segregationists.

634
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,746
He got it from the
Declaration of independence.

635
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,159
It was the American founding
that established the principles

636
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,263
that made possible the success
of the Civil Rights Movement.

637
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,999
The topic of race, more than
any other, generates taboos.

638
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,546
And taboos are the enemy
of history and of truth.

639
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,359
In the early 17th century when
slavery started in America,

640
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,064
another group was brought
to this country by force.

641
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,839
They were white indentured servants.

642
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,871
(SCREAMING)

643
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,667
Starting in 1618, children were
captured from the streets of London

644
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,746
and sold into colonial America.

645
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,959
But it didn't stop there.

646
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,479
Over the next century and a half,

647
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,799
another 150,000 Irish men,
women and children

648
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,462
were declared soldiers of war by Britain
and sold into colonial indentured servitude

649
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,306
with many landing in
Virginia and New England.

650
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,599
Indentured servitude was not slavery.

651
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,021
It didn't have the same ideology
of racial dehumanization.

652
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,021
And it was for a limited period,
typically seven years.

653
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,399
Yet, these people often
had their term extended

654
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,467
or died before they
got their freedom.

655
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,079
Indentured servants worked
side by side with slaves.

656
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,191
(GRUNTING)

657
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,386
For many years, white indentured
servants outnumbered black slaves.

658
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,959
Our next story, one you
won't find in Howard Zinn,

659
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,708
is set in South Carolina,

660
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,143
where we encounter one of the most
feared plantation owners in the South.

661
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,587
Meet William Ellison.

662
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,279
Born himself into slavery,
Ellison was freed as a young man.

663
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,199
He became a blacksmith,
then a mechanic for cotton gins.

664
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,639
And then went into farming

665
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,239
where he eventually owned
1,000 acres and 60 slaves.

666
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,759
He was also known as a slave breeder,

667
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,159
a practice shunned even by
most white slave owners.

668
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,749
That's a fine young one for you.

669
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,719
D'SOUZA: When the Civil War broke out,
Ellison supported the Confederacy,

670
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,839
investing in Confederate bonds

671
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,908
and supplying food and provisions
for the Confederate army.

672
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,039
Ellison's story is told by
the African American scholar

673
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,719
Henry Louis Gates.

674
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,239
Gates and other scholars estimate that
in the period before the Civil War,

675
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:13,664
there were approximately 3,500 free blacks
who owned more than 10,000 black slaves.

676
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,719
In South Carolina and Louisiana,

677
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,879
Gates points out,
the percentage of free blacks

678
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,199
who owned slaves was
approximately the same

679
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,719
as the percentage of
whites who owned slaves.

680
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,879
These episodes illustrate the
universality of the conquest ethic

681
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,479
and the uniqueness of the
American response to it.

682
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,959
Slavery existed all over the world.

683
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,439
The Egyptians had slaves.
The Chinese had slaves.

684
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,919
The Africans did. American Indians
had slaves long before Columbus.

685
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,439
And tragically, slavery continues
today in many countries.

686
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,986
What's uniquely Western
is the abolition of slavery.

687
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,399
And what's uniquely American is the
fighting of a great war to end it.

688
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,079
Zinn wants a narrative
of American shame.

689
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,759
That's why he leaves
these stories out.

690
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,022
And that's why we have a moral
obligation to put them back in.

691
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,951
And here's someone else who
gets left out of Zinn's narrative.

692
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,079
Good afternoon. I'm Madam Walker
and this is my daughter Lelia.

693
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,024
D'SOUZA: Meet Sarah Breedlove,
also known as Madam C.J. Walker.

694
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,944
She started selling her own hair
care products door to door.

695
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,469
Madam C.J. Walker became the first
self-made female millionaire in America.

696
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,869
- They're ready for you.
- Thank you.

697
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,679
Good morning, madam.

698
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,860
Good morning, ladies.
Get back to work.

699
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,999
See, ladies, you don't
have to define yourself

700
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,999
by your current station in life.

701
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,839
But only by your vision
of who you can become.

702
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,079
WOMEN: Yes. Yes.

703
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,519
- Today you see a success.
- Yes.

704
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,359
And I hear many of you
say, "But, Madam Walker,

705
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,540
"I just don't have the
opportunities you had."

706
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,621
And I respond, "Really?"

707
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,108
I was the first
freeborn in my family.

708
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,823
Orphaned at age seven.

709
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,479
Married at 14 and widowed
with child by 20.

710
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,039
WOMEN: Mmm-hmm.

711
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,559
WALKER: I'm a woman that came from
the cotton fields of the South.

712
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,639
WOMEN: Yes.

713
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,199
WALKER: From there, I was
promoted to the washtub.

714
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,879
From there, I was promoted
to the cook kitchen.

715
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,959
WOMEN: Uh-huh.

716
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,159
From there, I promoted
myself to the business

717
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,999
of manufacturing hair
goods and preparations.

718
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,559
Yes! (CHEERING)

719
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,439
I have built my own
factory on my own ground.

720
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,620
I got my start by
giving myself a start.

721
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,239
Ladies, there is no
flower-strewn path to success.

722
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,750
And if there is, I haven't found it.

723
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,199
If I've accomplished anything in my life,
it's because I was willing to work hard.

724
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,519
You can do something new today.

725
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,559
And don't be too haughty.

726
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,399
You can always go to
that washtub for a seat.

727
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,079
D'SOUZA: What a role model.

728
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,279
So why is she left out
of the history books?

729
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,079
Because she confounds
the shame narrative.

730
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,119
She's an African
American success story.

731
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,319
In a way, she sounds
like Martin Luther King.

732
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,599
King once said, "Every man
must write with his own hand

733
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,759
"the charter of his
Emancipation Proclamation.

734
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,639
"We are all in this
country a minority of one

735
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,948
"and how we succeed or fail
depends on our efforts."

736
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,119
D'SOUZA: Did America get rich by
simply stealing from other countries?

737
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,119
Starting with the Vietnam War,
another charge surfaced,

738
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,119
America the imperialist.

739
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,079
We will build a revolutionary
youth movement

740
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,639
capable of actively engaging in
the war against the imperialists.

741
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,959
We will escalate our attacks until
imperialism is defeated in Vietnam.

742
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,319
D'SOUZA: That was Bill Ayers,
founder of the Weather Underground.

743
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,999
He bombed the Pentagon

744
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,679
and says he wished he
could have done more.

745
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,679
He's now a college professor.

746
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,159
And who are his agents
of American imperialism?

747
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,119
Meet John Fer.

748
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,759
I always adored flying.

749
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,959
And I built and flew model airplanes
since I was five years old.

750
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,759
And so eventually become
a pilot in the Air Force.

751
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,066
D'SOUZA: But things didn't
work out so well for John Fer.

I landed on the ground

I was absolutely shocked at the
threshold that I had to cry uncle.

00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,868
I wanted to turn off the pain.

763
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,479
D'SOUZA: Why did you go to Vietnam?

764
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,039
I believed that we were
doing the right thing

765
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,839
of helping the South Vietnamese
stand on their own two feet,

766
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,679
so that one day then we
could extract ourselves

767
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,359
and we would have
a free South Vietnam.

768
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,159
I was there to give opportunity

769
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,626
for the South Vietnamese people
to exercise their own destiny.

770
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,679
D'SOUZA: John Fer would
spend the next six years

771
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,543
in the famed POW prison,
the Hanoi Hilton.

772
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,220
FER:
I came home to a different America.

773
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,519
D'SOUZA: Whatever you think
about the Vietnam War,

774
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,541
America wasn't stealing
from the Vietnamese.

775
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,719
And in Iraq, we spent a
whole bunch of money

776
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,559
and then we turned over
the oil fields to the Iraqis.

777
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,831
Under the conquest ethic,
we would have kept it.

778
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,399
In Afghanistan after 9/11,

779
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,199
the US military, even while
bombing terrorist targets,

780
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,586
was delivering food rations
to Afghan civilians.

781
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,799
And far from stealing,
America rebuilt Germany and Japan

782
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,184
after World War ll.

783
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,184
Contrary to the Zinn narrative,
we're not the bad guys of the world.

784
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,719
As Colin Powell said,

785
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:57,382
"The only land that America asks for
abroad is land to bury our dead."

786
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,799
Finally, capitalism.
Does it rip off the consumer?

787
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,279
Welcome to Delish Dinesh.

788
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,359
- Can I help you?
- I'll take a hamburger.

01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,519
$1.95.

790
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,479
D'SOUZA: Maria just paid
$1.95 for that hamburger.

Ek burger jaldi banao.

792
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,559
D'SOUZA: But the cost of
me making the hamburger,

793
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,959
with food, labor, rent, insurance,
advertising, permits...

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,861
- ...equals $1.79.
- (SIGHING)

796
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,190
Leaving me with a whopping
8% or 16 cent profit.

797
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,439
The best way to judge
if I'm ripping her off

798
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,747
is to see what it would cost for
her to make the burger at home.

799
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,823
Maria's burger has the same
stuff as Delish Dinesh.

800
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,479
But when you add it up,
Maria's homemade burger

801
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,799
costs $2. 22.

802
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,266
That's 27 cents more than the
burger at my restaurant.

803
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,661
And that doesn't even factor in the
time that it cost her to make it.

804
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,399
Does this work for the
big companies, too?

807
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,151
D'SOUZA:
Steve Jobs, did he rip people off?

808
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,509
He created products that people didn't
even know they wanted or needed.

809
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,519
But once he made them available,

810
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,479
they clamored for them and
stood in line to buy them

811
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,719
and freely spent their
money for them.

812
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,079
There's no rip-off.

813
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,919
Capitalism works not through
coercion or conquest,

814
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,191
but through the consent
of the consumer.

815
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,559
To see why there's
so much inequality,

816
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,879
consider the example of Zinn's
own disciple Matt Damon.

817
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,469
Here he is in The Bourne Ultimatum.

818
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,079
Here he is in The Bourne Identity.

819
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,399
How does Matt Damon make
so much more money than you?

820
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,799
Is it because he works
harder than you

821
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,108
putting in an intense six weeks filming
to earn several million dollars?

822
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,119
Could it be because of
his unbelievable skills?

823
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,470
Please.

824
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,759
There's only one reason Matt
Damon makes so much money.

825
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,239
The consumers who buy
tickets to his movies.

826
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,783

01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,901

Entrepreneurs and business
owners do use public services,

835
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,229
but so does everyone else.

836
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,719
Let's say, a successful
business owner

837
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,759
makes four times as much
as the average employee.

838
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,479
But she also pays four
times as much in taxes.

839
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,119
Do her kids get four times more
attention in public school?

840
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,639
Does she get to drive four
times as fast on the freeway?

841
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,279
Will the fire department
arrive four times faster?

842
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,744
No. Not at all.

843
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,549
What about the rest of the world?

844
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,871
Does capitalism promote
global injustice?

845
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,546
From businesses in the Middle East

846
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,748
to factories in South America

847
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,039
to entrepreneurs in China,

848
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,186
the world is embracing
the free market.

849
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,519
Does it seem to you ironic that this
sort of entrepreneurial capitalism,

850
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,839
that this recipe has become
so controversial at home here

851
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,439
while it is being enthusiastically embraced
in so many other parts of the world?

852
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,519
D'SOUZA: I spoke to Jagdish Bhagwati,

853
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,759
a professor of economics
at Columbia University

854
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,199
and a leading researcher
on global capitalism.

855
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,079
How many people have been
lifted out of poverty in India?

856
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,199
Over 200 million
people are, you know,

857
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,519
in less than 15 years,
have pulled out of poverty.

858
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,719
D'SOUZA: And in China
the number is even greater.

859
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,879
Far greater. It's about 400
to 500 million people.

860
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,759
'Cause they started earlier.

861
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,719
Capitalism, entrepreneurial capitalism
is the most important moral case.

862
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,559
So there's no reason
for us to be apologetic.

863
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,039
It's the other guys who
should be apologetic.

864
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,799
'Cause every bit of experience shows

865
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:56,471
that they're the ones who really
undermine the fortunes of the poor.

866
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,719
D'SOUZA: And when it comes to
helping the poor through charity,

867
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,079
you may be surprised
at who cares the most.

868
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,639
Meet Arthur Brooks, head of the
American Enterprise institute.

869
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,159
One of the things that
we typically find

870
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,559
in our modern conversation
about who's charitable

871
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,399
is that folks who believe in
greater government transfers,

872
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,359
more income redistribution,

873
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,399
they believe they're the most
charitable members of society.

874
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,079
When you look at the data,
a different picture emerges.

875
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,399
What we really find is that folks
who are on the conservative side,

876
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,879
especially the religious conservative
side, give away the most.

877
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,879
About four times as much.

878
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,471
About four times as much of their resources
as people who are on the secular left.

879
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,948
D'SOUZA: And if you're struggling in America,
is it still possible to pull yourself up?

880
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,879
I believed that my problems
were somebody else's fault.

881
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,439
I believed that America
was so inherently racist

882
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,279
that I didn't need to mainstream.

883
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,839
And I believed that the poor were poor
because the wealthy were wealthy.

884
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,719
D'SOUZA:
I met with my friend Star Parker.

885
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,879
You were on welfare for how long?

886
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,999
I was in and out seven years,
but three-and-a-half years consistently.

887
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,879
Did it ever occur to you to go looking
for work and if not, why not?

888
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,519
Why bother? Why would I
go out and find work

889
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,279
when somebody else was willing to send
me a check on the 1st and the 15th?

890
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,999
My life go in a little black hole.

891
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,999
And that's where I was living.

892
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,159
When some people looked me in the eye
and pointed their finger in my face

893
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,799
and told me my lifestyle
was unacceptable to God,

894
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,319
and when they said that, I didn't
even know there were churches,

895
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,159
but there was something about their
conviction that got my attention.

896
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,839
I finally went to church with
them and heard the gospel

897
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,999
and I changed and I
went back to college.

898
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,479
I got a degree. I started a business.

899
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,159
And now I run an organization today

900
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,639
and am a nationally syndicated
columnist and an author.

901
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,662
D'SOUZA: For me, Star Parker
is the quintessential American.

902
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,319
She draws on those classic American
virtues that Tocqueville talked about,

903
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:00,789
individual initiative, community,
faith, to help herself and others.

904
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,182
So is the wealth of
America based on theft?

905
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,903
Actually, no.

906
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,743
The wealth of America isn't
stolen, it's created.

907
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,239
MAN: All right, this way. This way.

908
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,919
D'SOUZA:
The ethic of conquest is universal.

909
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,039
What's uniquely American
is the alternative,

910
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,506
equal rights, self-determination
and wealth creation.

911
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,839
If America did not exist,

912
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,719
the conquest ethic would
dominate the world once again.

913
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,719
America isn't the problem.

914
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,229
America is the answer.

915
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,119
Tocqueville knew that.

916
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,106
I know it.

917
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,629
And so does U2's Bono.

918
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,879
It's not a right-left issue.

919
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,719
It's a right-wrong issue.

920
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,999
And America has constantly been
on the side of what's right.

921
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,239
Because when it comes down to it,

922
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,467
this is about keeping faith
with the idea of America.

923
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,159
Because America is an idea, isn't it?

924
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,784
I mean, Ireland is a great
country, but it's not an idea.

925
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,079
Great Britain is a great country.

926
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,384
It's not an idea.

927
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,679
That's how we see
you around the world.

928
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,759
As one of the greatest
ideas in human history.

929
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,279
Right up there with the Renaissance.

930
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,119
Right up there with crop rotation

931
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,470
- and the Beatles' White Album.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

932
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,351
You and me are created equal.

933
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,670
If we have dignity, if we have justice,
then leave it to us, we'll do the rest.

934
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,719
This country was the first

935
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,981
to claw its way out of darkness
and put that on paper.

936
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,199
These aren't just
American ideas anymore.

937
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,983
There's no copyright on them.
You brought them into the world.

938
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,784
These truths, your truths,
they're self-evident in us.

939
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,839
D'SOUZA: But now we turn
to a political question.

940
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:47,159
If America is a force for good,
why are they trying to make us feel bad?

941
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,319
Who's behind this?

942
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:54,399
The shaming of America is not accidental.
It's part of a strategy.

943
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,159
SAUL ALINSKY:
This becomes a contest of power.

944
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,959
Now, power has always
gone into two areas,

945
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,999
those who have money
and those who have people.

946
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,919
We have nothing but people.

947
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,519
If an organizer doesn't have
any idea what to do about it,

948
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,919
he hasn't got any damn
business being in there.

949
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,319
Do I make myself clear?

950
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,519
D'SOUZA: Who was Saul Alinsky?

951
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,119
Saul Alinsky was a man of the left,
and very far to the left.

952
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,279
To pin it down, he was
a democratic socialist.

953
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,239
Meaning that he wanted the United
States to become a socialist country,

954
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:31,159
but he was willing to see that happen
slowly through the democratic process.

955
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,759
You tell them that I'm meeting with my staff
and with the fight leaders on Friday at noon.

956
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,239
D'SOUZA: I spoke to scholar
and author Stanley Kurtz,

957
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,879
who's done extensive
research on Alinsky.

958
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,159
STANLEY KURTZ:
Well, Alinsky wants to polarize.

959
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,079
He wants the people he calls
"the haves" to feel guilty

960
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,148
and he wants the people he calls
"the have nots" to feel resentful.

961
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,119
D'SOUZA: Alinsky perfected the
art of the political shakedown.

962
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,519
ALINSKY: I have, on occasion,
remarked that I felt confident

963
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,239
that I could persuade a
millionaire on a Friday

964
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,999
to subsidize a
revolution for Saturday,

965
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,599
out of which he would make
a huge profit on Sunday,

966
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,559
even though he was certain
to be executed on Monday.

967
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,470
D'SOUZA: While finishing graduate school,
Alinsky sought out an unusual mentor.

968
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,828
Frank Nitti, Al Capone's
number two in the Chicago mob.

969
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,631
Known as a thug or a hoodlum.

970
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,185
Also known as a
racketeer and gangster.

971
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,359
ALINSKY:
Nitti took me under his wing.

972
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,799
I called him the professor
and I became his student.

973
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,999
Nitti's boys took me everywhere,
showed me all of the mob's operations

974
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,999
from gin mills and whorehouses
and bookie joints

975
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,199
to the legitimate businesses they
were beginning to take over.

976
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,999
Within a few months,
I got to know the workings

977
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,180
of the Capone mob inside out.

978
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,279
D'SOUZA: Alinsky saw up close
the ease with which the Mafia

979
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,985
could extract money through
theft, intimidation and murder.

980
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,719
But he figured out a way to do
it without going to prison.

981
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,159
How is it the haves prosper while
we struggle just to survive?

982
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,679
He wanted to build from the ground up

983
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:21,799
by creating a sort of coalition
of community organizations

984
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,583
that he hoped to establish
all across the country.

985
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,519
ALINSKY:
The one thing I've come to realize

986
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,359
is that any positive action
for radical social change

987
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,540
will have to be focused
on the white middle class

988
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,260
for the simple reason that this
is where the real power lies.

989
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,039
D'SOUZA:
The American middle class is decent.

990
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,061
It wants to live up
to its own ideals.

991
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,799
Alinsky knew that if he could show a gap
between people's lives and their ideals,

992
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,549
he could exploit their
shame to gain power.

993
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:04,064
Alinsky became the godfather in the art
of using shame for political shakedown.

994
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,359
But he needed an army of recruits
to carry out the shakedown.

995
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,664
And he knew where to look.

996
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,559
The 1960s saw the birth
of a new generation

997
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,239
alienated from its parents,
alienated from America.

998
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,639
Ripe pickings for Alinsky.

999
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,519
But first he had to
straighten them out.

1000
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,999
I have a hell of a lot
more love than you have

1001
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,559
because I'm willing to go out
and get corruptive for it.

1002
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:33,399
I'm willing to fight for it. I'm willing
to stick my life on the line on it.

1003
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,119
And you're just willing to stick around
and talk about love and hippies

1004
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,743
and not do a damn thing.

1005
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,679
D'SOUZA:
Alinsky wrote an instruction manual

1006
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,303
for this new army of
shakedown artists.

1007
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,839
In Rules For Radicals, we discover
that the mobster Frank Nitti

1008
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,781
was not Alinsky's only mentor.

1009
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,909
(ALINSKY READING)

1010
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,559
D'SOUZA: Alinsky was an atheist.

1011
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,501
What could he possibly
learn from the Devil?

1012
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,319
Three things. Polarization.

1013
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,279
We've got to get away from
all this reconciliation jazz

1014
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,319
and all this friendship and
all that kind of business.

1015
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,839
D'SOUZA: Demonization.

1016
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,919
They'd love to see all the Negroes
in America living on the reserves.

1017
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,119
D'SOUZA: And deception.

1018
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,079
ALINSKY: You do what you
can with what you have

1019
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,908
and close it with moral arguments.

1020
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:46,310
D'SOUZA: Today, Alinsky's influence
can be seen across academia,

1021
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,111
the media

1022
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,190
and government.

1023
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,279
And his most famous disciple lives
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

1024
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,159
I don't think there's any
doubt that Barack Obama

1025
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:13,599
really hasn't leveled with the American
public about his political past.

1026
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,679
And this is probably the
most dramatic example.

1027
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,559
Obama first encountered
Alinskyite organizing

1028
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,799
at a series of socialist conferences

1029
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,759
that he attended when he lived
in New York City as a young man.

1030
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,199
Those conferences touted Alinskyite
organizing as the next big political wave

1031
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,839
and as the best way to bring
socialism to America.

1032
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,319
And those same conferences
touted Chicago

1033
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,879
as the place to find the very
best Alinskyite organizers.

1034
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,119
D'SOUZA: Clearly Obama has mastered
the Alinskyite strategy of deception.

1035
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,479
We will keep this promise.

1036
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,639
If you like your doctor,
you keep seeing your doctor.

1037
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,879
If you like your doctor...

1038
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,559
If you like your doctor,
you can keep your doctor.

1039
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:57,439
Save a typical family
an average of $2,500.

1040
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,199
I'll make our government
open and transparent.

1041
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,719
We're building a transparent process.

1042
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,239
No matter what you've heard,

1043
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,479
if you like your doctor or health
care plan, you can keep it.

1044
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,159
If you don't have insurance,
you'll finally be able to afford it.

1045
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,479
D'SOUZA: Alinsky would be
so proud of Obamacare.

1046
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,741
It's a masterpiece of
distortion and extortion.

1047
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,599
Here's the distortion.

1048
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,239
Obama gives the impression
that he is colluding with us

1049
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,559
against the insurance companies.

1050
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,868
But in reality, he's colluding with
the insurance companies against us.

1051
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:38,159
He's forcing Americans to buy
insurance who don't want to buy it.

1052
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,799
And this makes the insurance
companies very happy

1053
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,141
because it means more
profits for them.

1054
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,759
With the corporate and the bank
bailouts, it was the same deal.

1055
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,759
Obama embraced the bailouts.

1056
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,759
He recognized it was a way

1057
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,146
for the federal government to gain
control over those institutions.

1058
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,759
What these naive corporate
executives don't realize

1059
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,679
is that while they might
make a profit on Sunday,

1060
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,667
they could be gone by Monday.

1061
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,145
But Obama wasn't the only disciple.

1062
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,559
KURTZ: Well, when Hillary
was still in high school,

1063
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,679
she fell under the spell of
a Methodist youth minister.

1064
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,399
And at that time Hillary
had been a Goldwater girl.

1065
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:48,788
A conservative growing up in a perfectly
conventional American suburb.

1066
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:55,468
But this very charismatic Methodist
minister drew Hillary sharply to the left.

1067
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,999
Mr. Alinsky, this is Hillary.

1068
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,226
- A pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

1069
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,359
- Are you enjoying your work back there?
- I am.

1070
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,679
Well, you'll have a lot of it.

1071
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,711
(INAUDIBLE CHATTERING)

1072
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,039
D'SOUZA: After high school,
Hillary met with Alinsky again

1073
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,879
at Wellesley College,
where she invited him to speak.

1074
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,105
(INAUDIBLE)

1075
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,071
Later, Alinksy would offer her a
job, but Hillary turned it down.

1076
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,719
When she got to college,
she decided to focus

1077
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,399
on Alinsky as her senior thesis work.

1078
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,159
Hillary was looking
to Alinsky for a way

1079
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,439
to put her existing leftist
ideology into practice.

1080
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:15,079
But in studying Alinsky.
Hillary came to the conclusion

1081
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,479
that Alinsky organizing could
never truly transform America

1082
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,599
unless it somehow was
connected more deeply

1083
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,039
To the core of the
American political system.

1084
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:31,599
Alinsky always opposed tight relationships
between community organizers and politics.

1085
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,828
So this is where Hillary decided to
take Alinsky in a different direction.

1086
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,759
D'SOUZA: While Alinsky wanted the
radicals to pressure the government,

1087
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,509
Hillary wanted the radicals
to become the government.

1088
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,959
Why try to shame people
from the outside

1089
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,901
when you can intimidate
them from the inside?

1090
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:06,029
KURTZ: So I would say on ideology.
Hillary is closer to Obama than she is to Bill.

1091
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:17,064
D'SOUZA: Hillary figured it out,
Obama is now carrying it out.

1092
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:27,159
The IRS, EPA, DOJ, NSA

1093
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,707
are all collecting information and
storing it on every American.

1094
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,519
Welcome to the Panopticon,

1095
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,759
a prison designed by philosopher
Jeremy Bentham in the 1800s.

1096
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,385
His design gave the
guards a God's eye view.

1097
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,822
Here, there's no privacy,

1098
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,386
What Bentham envisioned for a prison
has now become the hi-tech Panopticon.

1099
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,382
Nobody is listening to
your telephone calls.

1100
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,079
The United States is not
spying on ordinary people

1101
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,782
who don't threaten
our national security.

1102
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:23,879
There's no question that the collection
of these huge amounts of data

1103
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,199
gives the government the ability
to go after anybody and everybody.

1104
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,719
The government will always use
as much power as you give it.

1105
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:37,426
It will always go up to and
sometimes cross over, eh, the line.

1106
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,919
RAND PAUL: That's a real problem,

1107
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,439
particularly if we're looking at
everyone's Internet searches,

1108
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,799
we're looking at what magazines
you read, what books you read,

1109
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,599
and really a lot of your life.

1110
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,559
Imagine how much of
your life is online.

1111
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,919
If they can look at your
Visa bill without a warrant.

1112
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,945
This program, by the way,
is fully overseen by the FISA Court,

1113
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:05,239
a court specially put together
to evaluate classified programs

1114
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,799
to make sure that
the executive branch

1115
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,439
or government generally
is not abusing them

1116
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:14,679
and that it's being carried out
consistent with the Constitution.

1117
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,279
The FISA Court should not be
allowed to use the term "court."

1118
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,119
It is not a court.

1119
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:25,119
A court by definition means an
institution that hears both sides

1120
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,959
of a case and controversy.

1121
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,439
Due process is an open court.
Adversarial process on both sides of it.

1122
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,159
But it's not in a secret court.

1123
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:38,799
FISA, with nobody to advocate for the
individual that's being spied upon.

1124
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,719
Judges should not be
allowed to wear robes.

1125
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,279
They shouldn't be allowed
to use the word "judge."

1126
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,679
They shouldn't be allowed
to use the word "court."

1127
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,839
And it's misleading the public.

1128
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,639
Many people will say,
"I haven't done anything wrong

1129
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,639
"and so I don't really care
if they read my mail."

1130
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,719
The problem with that is it's
a much different standard

1131
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,239
than innocent until proven guilty.

1132
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,839
It's that everything is open.

1133
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,279
They come into your house and say,

1134
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,799
"Oh, you've been sending
e-mails to someone in Lebanon.

1135
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,159
"We suspect you of terrorism."

1136
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,159
If they get in your house
and they find no terrorism,

1137
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,119
you're not connected,
but they find you have paint

1138
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,239
that you brought home from the office
that you bought with a business expense

1139
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,479
and you were painting your office,

1140
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,999
now you're painting
the inside of your house,

1141
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,999
you've now committed a tax violation.

1142
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,279
Or maybe they find you
have an unregistered gun.

1143
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,679
Everything in America
now is criminal.

1144
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,799
You can't practice commercial law

1145
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,999
or real estate law, be in
the hedge fund business,

1146
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,060
do a great many things without running
afoul of potential criminal statute.

1147
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,119
Harvey, you've written a book
that has the remarkable title

1148
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,639
Three Felonies a Day.

1149
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,439
Now, how is it possible for an ordinary
guy to commit three felonies a day?

1150
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,319
On a normal day,

1151
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:54,039
the average reasonably engaged American
does at least three things that arguably

1152
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:58,039
can be deemed federal
felonies by some ambitious

1153
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,199
Department of Justice prosecutor.

1154
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:06,239
The problem with most federal felonies
is that an average normal person,

1155
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,359
even, I have to say,
a lot of my fellow lawyers,

1156
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,719
wouldn't have a clue that
what they're engaging in

1157
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,559
is arguably prosecutable.

1158
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,239
PAUL: Well, and consider it
on top of this IRS scandal

1159
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:22,999
where it appears as if the government
is using the IRS for partisan reasons.

1160
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,119
Maybe I'm not so, uh,
confident that I would want

1161
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,839
all my phone records given to,
uh, the government

1162
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,039
if it appears maybe I could be
targeted by the government.

1163
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,159
I talk to people routinely now
who I don't think are paranoid,

1164
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,879
who are saying, "I'm a little
worried about having my name

1165
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,919
"publically associated with conservatives
or Republicans because I fear retaliation.

1166
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:46,839
"I fear that I will be targeted
by the SEC or the IRS

1167
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,279
"or different arms of government."

1168
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,399
And I think it's a legitimate fear.

1169
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,079
I think there's probably almost nothing
more fundamentally un-American

1170
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,879
than using government to target
your political opponents.

1171
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,279
Well, when the President does it,
that means that it is not illegal.

1172
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:04,399
During the Nixon Administration,
I was audited four times.

1173
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:09,919
I was audited because I was a very
vocal critic of the Nixon Administration.

1174
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,239
We all pay taxes.
We all file tax returns.

1175
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:18,279
And talk about a trap for the unwary.
They can get absolutely anybody.

1176
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,399
They can bankrupt you just from
trying to defend against them.

1177
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,439
And then the rest of the game is

1178
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,079
are you going to avoid
a long prison sentence

1179
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,590
and pled guilty for a short sentence?

1180
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:38,479
There are a lot of people in
prison today based on guilty pleas

1181
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,679
who could have won their
case had they litigated it.

1182
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:45,987
But the risks of litigation are so
great that they can't afford to do it.

1183
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,759
It was Lavrenty Beria
who told Stalin,

1184
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,987
"Show me the man and
I'll find you the crime."

1185
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:01,319
What the government did to our little group
in Wetumpka, Alabama, is un-American.

1186
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,079
It isn't a matter of firing
or arresting individuals.

1187
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:09,479
The individuals who sought to intimidate us
were acting as they thought they should

1188
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:13,319
in a government culture that has
little respect for its citizens.

1189
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,199
Many of the agents and agencies
of the federal government

1190
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:20,159
do not understand that they
are servants of the people.

1191
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,399
They think they are our masters,
and they are mistaken.

1192
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,839
I'm not interested in
scoring political points.

1193
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,590
I want to protect and preserve
the America that I grew up in.

1194
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:38,679
The America that people crossed oceans
and risked their lives to become a part of.

1195
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,959
And I am terrified
it is slipping away.

D'SOUZA: Aaron Swartz
was an internet whiz kid.

1198
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:58,879
At 14, he developed a new way to
publish information on the Web.

1199
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,599
In his late teens, he cofounded a
company that merged with Reddit

1200
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,510
to become one of the Web's most
frequently used social news sites.

1201
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:14,199
He became a vocal critic of several of
the Obama Administration's policies.

1202
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,399
SWARTZ: The freedoms
guaranteed in our Constitution,

1203
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,919
the freedoms our country had been
built on would be suddenly deleted.

1204
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,999
Aaron Swartz was prosecuted
by the US Attorney's office

1205
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,264
in Massachusetts for allegedly breaking
into the computer networks at MIT

1206
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:35,399
and downloading without authorization
thousands of academic articles.

1207
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,199
He was charged with crimes
that would have carried

1208
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:43,559
a penalty of up to 35 years in
prison and $1 million fine.

1209
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,359
D'SOUZA: The articles were
funded by taxpayer money

1210
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,079
and Aaron thought they should
be available to the public.

1211
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,799
The government argued they
were copyrighted material.

1212
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,239
It strikes me as disproportionate,
being used inappropriately

1213
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,359
to try to bully, uh,
someone into pleading guilty

1214
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:03,110
to something that strikes
me as rather, uh, minor.

1215
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,199
D'SOUZA: The company that
owns the copyrighted articles

1216
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,559
asked federal prosecutors
to drop the charges.

1217
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:13,981
But the prosecutor wanted
to send Aaron to prison.

1218
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:23,303
On January 11, 2013,
Aaron Swartz took his own life.

1219
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,668
He was 26 years old.

feds are unfairly targeting conservatives

1221

and author Dinesh D'Souza

1224
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,199

because of the film that you did

1231
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,508
leading up to last year's election?

1232
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:19,344
D'SOUZA: I made a mistake and
I'm not above the law. No one is.

1233
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,679
But we don't want
to live in a society

open and winks at her friends

1235
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,825

at her adversaries.

At the point where we stop them.

D'SOUZA: The Revolution was a

The Civil War was a struggle for
