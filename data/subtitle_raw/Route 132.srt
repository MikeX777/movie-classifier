1
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,330
Mr Michaud?

2
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,469
No.

3
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,103
Mr Michaud, we have to talk.

4
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,475
Gilles!

5
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,032
Get me out of here.

6
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,138
What?

7
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,036
Will this one do?

8
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,012
Yeah.

9
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,154
Shall we go together tomorrow?

10
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,396
OK.

11
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,359
Pick you up at 9?

12
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,900
- Lf you want.
- Yeah.

13
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,767
I'll tell them that one's fine.

14
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,011
See you tomorrow.

15
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,767
Don't blame yourself.

16
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,638
It's not yourfault.

17
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,106
It could've happened with me.

18
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,672
Hey, man! Lost your bearings?

19
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,984
Oheck out these novelties.

20
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:58,951
Gilles Michaud?

21
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,754
- Bob!
- I'll be fucked!

22
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,492
- Hey there.
- Hey.

23
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,164
It's been ages.
You haven't changed a bit!

24
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,298
How are you?

25
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,092
You in a rush?

26
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,269
No.

27
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,438
Oarole, a pitcher please!

28
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,674
Put it there!

29
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,659
Did you or Bisaillon

30
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,226
keep the speakers we stole?

31
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,363
Shit, you were a lousy thief!

32
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,755
I don't remember that.

33
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,994
You dropped the speakers
4 times outside the church!

34
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,934
The priest ran after us
in his slippers!

35
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,268
Bisaillon wasrt too sharp.

36
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,045
Fartman!

37
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,611
He skateboarded
down the ramp on his belly!

38
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,272
I saw that!

39
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,714
- Fuck, did I!
- You were there!

40
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,616
Our old hood's dead.

41
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,356
Summer, you swelter.
Winter, you watch the bricks crack.

42
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,561
I feel like moving to the country,

43
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,199
buying a piece of land, a cabin.

44
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,894
I dunno, raise rabbits for a change.

45
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,401
It's sick, I've never been
outside the city.

46
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,778
The country can be boring too.

47
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,143
It's a change.

48
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,277
You still a professor?

49
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,120
What are you doing here?

50
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,819
Well, today, I...

51
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,555
I felt like remembering.

52
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,798
You are stewed.
Have you been drinking all day?

53
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,612
I came back to see
my old neighborhood.

54
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,681
I'm burying my son tomorrow.

55
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,551
What?

56
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,721
My little boy died.

57
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,831
I'm sorry, Gilles.

58
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,305
Drink.

59
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,367
Drink and shut up.

60
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,861
Takes a thief who doesn't rob often,

61
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,497
but who robs big
so he can stop robbing.

62
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,532
- Who does he rob?
- Fuck!

63
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,662
You put yourfinger on it. Rob who?

64
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,402
What? Where?

65
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,143
Robbing big has become impossible
in Montréal, shit.

66
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,803
Fucking Ohrist!

67
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,582
You feel like you're in a policearium.

68
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,416
- What?
- Apolicearium, shit!

69
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,288
Acop incubator.

70
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,026
No, I mean it.

71
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,895
Every goddamn little peanut vendor

72
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,757
has cameras, security guards,

73
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,930
$10,000 alarm systems,
titanium bars, hell!

74
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,835
Then go to the country.

75
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,011
The country?

76
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,774
Yeah, in the boonies.
All the banks are loaded with cash.

77
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,609
The old folks' savings.

78
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,745
That's where they stuff their cash.

79
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,255
Think so?

80
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,947
Wanna rob? Rob a bank!

81
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,615
Abank!

82
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,784
Jesus!

83
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,455
Gilles, a bank, shit!

84
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,266
Abank's fucking serious.

85
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,633
It's an idea... a crazy one.

86
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,033
But it's an idea.

87
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,378
Tomorrow we split.
You need a change of air.

88
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,312
Follow the 132 down the river.

89
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,143
Yeah.

90
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,388
Tomorrow morning. I'll find a car.

91
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,857
Denis at the shop owes me one.

92
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,754
Gilles, you ready?

93
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,197
I'm blocking the lane.

94
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,636
Yeah.

95
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,831
No suitcase?

96
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,440
No.

97
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,244
The country!

98
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,608
Abig change from Montréal!

99
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,278
What are you doing? Put that away!

100
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,545
Is it loaded?

101
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,839
It's not real.

102
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,711
Think I'm that dumb?

103
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,450
Put it away before somebody sees.

104
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:42,943
What's it for?

105
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,091
We have a job to do? We need tools.

106
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,038
I don't believe it!

107
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,185
What's wrong?

108
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,742
I'm such a fuckup!

109
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,753
What?

110
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,250
His picture's gone.

111
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,296
That's enough.

112
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,442
What are you doing?

113
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,637
If I hurry, we can still make it.

114
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,012
I don't want to go to the cemetery...

115
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,948
Orwatch him be put in the ground.

116
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:52,981
Goddamit!

117
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,020
I can't face the funeral.

118
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,554
<i>Today I decided to sing in slang</i>

119
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,129
<i>I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool</i>

120
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,231
<i>Today I decided to dress like a bum</i>

121
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,336
<i>I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool</i>

122
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:53,817
Are you alright?

123
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,554
Yeah, sure.

124
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,448
What's wrong?

125
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,210
That's your son?

126
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,428
How old is he?

127
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:43,935
He was 5.

128
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,606
What was his name?

129
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,858
Gabriel.

130
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,297
I'm sorry.

131
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,683
Shit, nothing's where it should be.

132
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:41,875
Well!

133
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,614
Is this the solenoid?

134
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,088
Or the water pump, the bendix?

135
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,923
Search me.

136
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:23,661
Hello?

137
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,819
Anybody home?

138
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,599
Hello?

139
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:47,952
Sir?

140
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,382
Our car broke down.

141
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,050
Oould I call for a tow?

142
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,594
Stéphane?

143
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,794
Is that you, Stéphane?

144
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,764
Have you been haying?

145
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,570
No, sorry, I'm not Stéphane.

146
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,966
Did you bring the hay in?

147
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,079
I'm not Stéphane.

148
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:20,952
Hello.

149
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,148
Mr Orête thinks his son is coming.

150
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,252
Stéphane left long ago, Mr Orête.
You know that.

151
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,432
Yes, yes.

152
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,259
Oan we help you?

153
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,098
Our car broke down. May I call?

154
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,998
Right by the phonebook.

155
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,310
Thanks.

156
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,928
What is it? Italian? German?

157
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,505
Swedish.

158
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,607
They sure do make it complicated.

159
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,000
Fucking lkea... shit!

160
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,444
How are we going to pay?

161
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,982
- You're kidding me.
- What?

162
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,979
You have no money?

163
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:30,955
No.

164
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,025
A professor with no credit cards?

165
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,160
They're maxed out.

166
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,930
Funeral parlor, cemetery...

167
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,298
You'd be surprised.

168
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,397
I guess. Sorry.

169
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,369
Look, I have a bit of cash

170
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,537
and gifts for cooperative mechanics.

171
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,369
Got the owner's manual?

172
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,208
- The what?
- The handbook.

173
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,048
Glove box.

174
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,242
No, it's not there.

175
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,086
Shit!

176
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,018
Hold on! I'll do it.

177
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,324
There's a trick to opening it.

178
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,537
Here.

179
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,339
You're not wearing a watch?

180
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,169
They always break.

181
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,909
Lemme show you these beauties.

182
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,240
Brand new, all imports.

183
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,014
Anything happens, you just call.

184
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,585
They'll ship you a new one overnight.

185
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,750
Top quality.

186
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,862
You don't have money to pay?

187
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,657
Let's say I have

188
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,761
some of the money, but...

189
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,291
Where you from?

190
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,674
Montréal.

191
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,313
Are you near Ohinatown in Montréal?

192
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,448
Do we look like chop suey freaks?

193
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,650
Montréal chicks are cool.

194
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,258
True.

195
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,928
Ohinatown...

196
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,192
it's full-on Asian.

197
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,637
Are you having a wet dream all dressed?

198
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,981
Damn, the weed is good here!

199
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,447
Hi.

200
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,319
Yeah, hi.

201
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,956
From Montréal.

202
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,659
Nice welcome.

203
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,095
This is like a private club.

204
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,933
Nobody bothers us.

205
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,469
Aman can be alone with his dream.

206
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,608
And he'll finally know it.

207
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,789
Tell us about the bank.

208
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,481
The bank?

209
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,187
Is it busy in the morning?

210
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,696
Yeah... people come through there.

211
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,200
How many?

212
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,470
Nobody.

213
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,397
The bank closed last year.

214
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,642
There's just the ATM.

215
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,863
It's all about method.

216
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,734
It's only plate glass.

217
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,235
No sweat, we'll yank it out.

218
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,438
That thing weighs 21/2 tons.
How can you move it?

219
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,673
With a tractor.

220
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,547
Where do you get it?

221
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,578
In my uncle's shed.

222
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,581
It's all rusty, but it still works.

223
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,924
Your uncle might not like it.

224
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,152
He's dead.

225
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,632
Well, if he's dead...

226
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,598
Oome here!

227
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,745
The glass will make
way too much noise.

228
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,077
Better off going in the side.
Oome see.

229
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,654
Look.

230
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,251
In front we have the street.

231
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,224
On the side, we'd have to angle it...
it's too tight.

232
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,866
It's vinyl siding. It's easy to smash.

233
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,733
And then we can lift it by the side.

234
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,563
I've no grip in front.

235
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,505
O'mere. You didn't see right.

236
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,383
We can lift it,
we just smash the plaster.

237
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,344
They'll hear us 200 miles away.

238
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,902
<i>Looking for a socially responsible</i>
<i>investment?</i>

239
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,122
$9,280...

240
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,785
$9,300...

241
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,760
$9,320. Not a penny more.

242
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,497
Not bad, huh?

243
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,733
Fuckir A!
Tomorrow a hotel room and shower!

244
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,093
Going to Montréal?

245
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,628
Not right away.

246
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,869
Gimme your address.
I'm going soon.

247
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,176
Sure.

248
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,407
But I gotta warn you,
I don't live near Ohinatown.

249
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,038
Yeah, OK.

250
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,012
Gilles!

251
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:16,679
There's a bed.

252
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,353
Leave him alone.

253
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,251
I think he needs to be alone a bit.

254
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,517
But you...

255
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,228
What's this business with Asians?

256
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,592
Ever slept with an Asian?

257
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,962
It's my dream.

258
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,233
I have the feeling

259
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,943
they're guardians of the temple.

260
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,380
Temple?

261
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:45,783
What temple?

262
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,276
The temple of living nature.

263
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,420
If you look at Asian chicks, you see

264
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,024
their bodies are like writing.

265
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,794
Their eyes are like letters.

266
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,627
Their vagina... a signature.

267
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,492
Their hair, their smile...

268
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,637
their entire body is made up of signs.

269
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:12,131
They're like the mystery
and the solution at the same time.

270
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:13,811
Sleeping with them

271
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,670
is sleeping with the mystery
of living nature.

272
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,477
Not many Ohinese chicks in St Pascal.

273
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:22,810
Tough luck, Damien.

274
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,578
They block immigration here.

275
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,824
They want us to die off.

276
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,586
So we'll go where the Asians are

277
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,027
and bring'em back to the farm.

278
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,227
Holy shit!

279
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,229
You wear me out.

280
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,063
What hare-brained scheme is that?

281
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,508
You wanna start an Asian colony

282
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,268
in St Pascal of the Boonies?

283
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,942
ASzechuan Sexodrome?

284
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,648
Gilles, you hear that?

285
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,858
He'll be cold this winter.

286
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,691
Say what?

287
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,127
He'll be cold this winter.

288
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,540
At 5 they don't think.

289
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,604
I've always dressed him.

290
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,375
Hat, scarf, boots.

291
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,714
Pull on his mitts so snow won't get in.

292
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,950
He'll be cold playing outside.

293
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,485
He won't be cold.

294
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,931
The ground will freeze
and he's only wearing a shirt.

295
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,726
He'll be cold for sure.

296
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,267
He's too little.

297
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,205
He'll be OK.

298
00:31:58,783 --> 00:31:59,750
Oome...

299
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,226
That little bastard!

300
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,300
That fucking cock-sucking bastard!

301
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,498
What's wrong?

302
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,169
He took the cash! We were robbed!

303
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,368
Oall the cops.

304
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,515
Get up, we'll make a posse.

305
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,081
You go. I'm sleeping.

306
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,920
Get up, fuck!

307
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,614
I won't let a Mongoloid rob me!

308
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,823
Bob, forget it.

309
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:42,853
Fuck!

310
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,762
I'll crucify him!

311
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,261
Oalm down. We 'll find something.

312
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,565
How?

313
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,458
Next village.

314
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,743
I'll let the engine run.

315
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,412
Once you're out, we'll take a back road.

316
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,589
Yeah...

317
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:19,518
Well get going.

318
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,162
Wait. We don't know the layout.

319
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,001
So what?

320
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,502
You shout, Hold up! Get down!

321
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,272
Wait! That's not how you do it.

322
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,272
You choking up?

323
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,777
You're the thief!

324
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,650
I'm a fence, not a thief. Big difference!

325
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,288
Just hold on a sec. Wait.

326
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,230
Gilles, Ohrist!

327
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,066
Wait!

328
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,983
If I don't eat something, I'll faint.

329
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,221
I'm hungry and stinky.

330
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,498
There's a beach down the road.

331
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,459
Oome look.

332
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,567
We're here.

333
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,503
The beach is there.

334
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,247
How come you know this place?

335
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,181
When I was a kid my family came.

336
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,252
You never told me.

337
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,853
You never asked.

338
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,200
Still have family here?

339
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,070
My grars in a nursing home.

340
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,533
We'll visit her.

341
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,605
Not really.

342
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,475
We can eat with her.
They must serve hot meals.

343
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,276
Let's go!

344
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,544
We'll have good mushy food!

345
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,958
Ohillier here than in town!

346
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,802
The water's great!

347
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,504
Sure you won't come in?

348
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,706
It's great! Nippy!

349
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,443
That feels good!

350
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,486
It's saltwater here.

351
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,450
It's salty.

352
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,827
Room 202.

353
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,041
My handsome Gilles.

354
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,042
It's been so long

355
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,106
since you visited me.

356
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,648
Yes, a long time.

357
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,519
I'm sorry, Grandma.

358
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,021
How's life in the city?

359
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,192
It's not too hard?

360
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:48,854
Grandma,

361
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,801
my little boy died.

362
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,142
I know, my boy.

363
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:03,946
How?

364
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,480
Your mom called.

365
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,479
You 2 are talking?

366
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,785
Of course, my boy.

367
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,250
When things like that happen,

368
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,391
we can't ignore one another.

369
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,423
I'll leave you a minute.

370
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,872
I lost 2, you know.

371
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,945
I had 11 who lived,

372
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,481
but I lost 2.

373
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,545
A2-year-old

374
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,616
and a 6-month-old.

375
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,219
I didn't know, Grandma.

376
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:28,959
I didn't know.

377
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,162
You don't forget.

378
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,840
Ever.

379
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,769
You neverforget a child you lost.

380
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,523
How do you go on living?

381
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,213
Tight game.

382
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,290
Real tight.

383
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,545
Ohrist, it stinks of piss!

384
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,844
Sir! Sir! Please!

385
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,153
Yes?

386
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,580
Is there a dog here?

387
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,056
- No, pets aren't allowed.
- No?

388
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,719
Or cleaners. There's piss here.

389
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:05,955
Oould be.

390
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,621
Oould be?

391
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,160
You think it's normal?

392
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,034
Do you have a problem?

393
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,304
No, you have a problem.
I just said there's piss here.

394
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,666
I don't know who you are,
but mind your business.

395
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,740
Don't you get it?
I said it stinks of piss.

396
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,776
- I'll get the director.
- Smell it, dammit!

397
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,616
There are human beings here,

398
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,014
not pigs!

399
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,419
I hate botched work. Smell it!

400
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:37,754
Did Alain come back?

401
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,765
Yes.

402
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,600
He runs the motel now.

403
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,776
Why don't you sleep there tonight?

404
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,879
He wouldn't mind?

405
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,810
On the contrary.

406
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,282
He used to love it,

407
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,454
playing with you when you visited.

408
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:13,930
How is he?

409
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,068
I think

410
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,575
I'll sleep a bit now, Gilles.

411
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,496
Bye, Grandma.

412
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,107
I'll report you! Get off me!

413
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,704
Stop it, Bob!

414
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,344
I've got him.

415
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,408
I'll slaughter you mangy dogs!

416
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,511
We won't slaughter anyone.
Let's go.

417
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,726
A good fight whets my appetite!

418
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,119
If I don't eat I'll keel over.

419
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,691
What about you?

420
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:24,834
Oome on.

421
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,096
What?

422
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,096
The Levite must be eating supper.

423
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,307
It's Ohristian charity.

424
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,408
Who?

425
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,106
The what?

426
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,813
The Levite. Didrt you go to school?

427
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,216
Not long enough.

428
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,292
These places are never open.

429
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,432
Like banks.

430
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:02,861
Gentlemen?

431
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,264
May I help you?

432
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:09,440
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

433
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,940
- Are you the priest?
- Yes.

434
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,578
- The name's Bob.
- Evening, Bob.

435
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:14,941
- Gilles.
- Hi, Gilles.

436
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,916
It was filthy. It was scary, Ohrist!

437
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,948
Sorry, Father.

438
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,885
- Oall me Jean-Pierre.
- OK, Jean-Pierre. JP.

439
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,695
It was disgusting,

440
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,922
I wouldn't let my dog sleep there.

441
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,128
I called,
the regional office is swamped.

442
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,300
They rely on the private sector.

443
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,832
They don't have the budget to be fussy.

444
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,942
Someone must check the quality of care?

445
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,108
Sure, in the bigger cities...

446
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,012
Riviêre-du-Loup, Matane, Rimouski.

447
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,376
We're too small.

448
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,381
Have you talked to the owner?

449
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,814
I've tried everything.

450
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,784
- He's not interested?
- Wort lift a finger.

451
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,132
I know you're going through
a great loss.

452
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,866
You know?

453
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,932
I see your grandmother often.

454
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,402
If you everwant to talk...

455
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,140
Of course.

456
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,609
The Ohurch is like Oonsolation Inc.

457
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,256
What do you mean?

458
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,352
Gilles teaches sociology.

459
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,196
Religiors a system
for repaying one's ancestors.

460
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,098
Yes, and...?

461
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,928
We all feel a debt to those
who gave us life.

462
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,373
So you think the Ohurch

463
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,406
allows us to pay off our debt

464
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,976
by honoring the dead.

465
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,279
Yes.

466
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:51,981
But not me.

467
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,611
I have no more debts.

468
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,084
I don't owe anyone anything.

469
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,320
What is it you sell?

470
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,426
Soporifics for the wounded souls?

471
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,423
Spiritual valium?

472
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,827
Abit simplistic, isn't it?

473
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,437
When will you shut the firm?

474
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,610
When the old folks are all buried?

475
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,238
- We 're no ordinary firm.
- Nah!

476
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,980
You deal in the vague and intangible.

477
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,946
Oredo quia absurdum est!

478
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,352
What horseshit!

479
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,282
Relax, Gilles. Relax.

480
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,594
I can deal with criticism of the Ohurch.

481
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,598
You know,

482
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,867
ritual is important
when you lose a loved one.

483
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,732
Whers your sors funeral?

484
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,136
It was 2 days ago.

485
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,537
I wasrt there.

486
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,079
You're not helping yourself.

487
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,881
God may not be in your life,

488
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,084
but there are stages you can't skip.

489
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,259
It catches up with you.

490
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,033
How bout a smoke?

491
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,270
Yeah, good idea.

492
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,430
Ooming, Gilles?

493
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,709
O'mon, Bob.
Your friend needs to be alone.

494
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,844
Yeah, right.

495
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,021
I'm sorry I brought him along.

496
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,831
But he kept insisting.

497
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,267
All you can do is keep an eye on him.

498
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,567
One day he'll ask to go back,
to face his grief.

499
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,975
It's inescapable.

500
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,451
I notice you don't have a watch.

501
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:47,717
I have these

502
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,155
excellent items. I wondered...

503
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,024
They're very fine watches,

504
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,261
excellent products.

505
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,294
Maybe there's one that interests you?

506
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,035
We're kinda short these days.

507
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,565
It'd help put gas in the car.

508
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,541
Give me one for $40.
I can't go higher.

509
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,605
Thank you, that's great. Thank you!

510
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:12,872
This one, maybe?

511
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,719
The blue one.

512
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,749
The blue one's more fun, more...

513
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:25,662
Nice.

514
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,528
Bingo! JP bought a watch!

515
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:41,468
What's that?

516
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,074
What did you do?

517
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:44,938
I mean, really!

518
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:48,376
JP feeds us, he knows your Gran,
and you rob him?

519
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,886
We're here to get rich, no?

520
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,324
Don't we deserve it?
Arert we deserving too?

521
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:55,857
Deserving, sure.

522
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,019
But he was nice to us.
I can't believe you!

523
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:02,561
Ohurch property belongs
to the people. Get in.

524
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,381
Thanks.

525
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,149
Go ahead.

526
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,188
No, go on, play.

527
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,522
I just...

528
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,460
I'm like the Russians.

529
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,068
The Russians?

530
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,569
We come here to learn.

531
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,666
I'm a lousy teacher.

532
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,503
Don't sell yourself short.
You're a natural.

533
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,937
You talk with your body.

534
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:28,914
And hit the white ball low,
you'll never sink it.

535
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:38,820
- Thanks.
- Well done.

536
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,086
My pleasure.

537
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,902
- So?
- It's interesting.

538
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,304
He says that

539
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,082
this guy Lévesque might buy it.

540
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,382
He works in the town rec department.

541
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,592
We just have to find him.

542
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,730
Oart be hard in a small town.

543
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,612
I bought you a change of clothes.

544
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,558
You OK?

545
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,289
I can't feel my legs.

546
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,796
What?

547
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,291
I can't feel my legs.

548
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:49,990
What do you mean?

549
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,026
I can't feel my legs!

550
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,031
Hold on, I'll help you.

551
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,332
Oan you stand up?

552
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,666
You OK?

553
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,443
Stay here. I'll get the car.

554
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,482
Don't move.

555
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,014
That your cousin?

556
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,156
Yeah.

557
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,113
I'll give you cabin 8.

558
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,109
It's the only decent one.

559
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,947
Anything goes, we're not choosy.

560
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,282
You were a Peacekeeper?

561
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,723
Yeah.

562
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:23,982
Must've been tough.

563
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,592
You want to talk?

564
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,934
Follow me.

565
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,266
I left the army 2 years after that.

566
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,145
You were bored, fed up?

567
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,481
No.

568
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,076
The army was my life.

569
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,641
Why'd you quit?

570
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:25,320
I didn't quit, my nerves did.

571
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,920
When I came back I couldn't sleep.

572
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:33,221
If the kettle whistled, I hit the floor.

573
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:57,586
Well,

574
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,079
it's been a long day.

575
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,320
Thanks for the beer.

576
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,459
I think...

577
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,324
I served 6 months in Bosnia.

578
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,098
Yeah?

579
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,092
What exactly did you do there?

580
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:15,797
Good question.

581
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,698
What do you mean?

582
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,042
Our mission changed.

583
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,743
Our job was to escort aid convoys.

584
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,619
Suddenly we were defending a city.

585
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:37,224
55,000 civilians in a town of 15,000.

586
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,555
We were 200 Oanadian soldiers.

587
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,660
55,000 civilians who couldn't escape?

588
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,561
If they tried,
they were shot like sitting ducks.

589
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,608
No electricity.

590
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:54,971
No running water.

591
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,913
Ahospital filled to bursting.

592
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:00,941
No medicine.

593
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,281
You heard the screams all day long.

594
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,317
They did amputations

595
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,789
without anesthesia.

596
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,699
We took over the Fojnica orphanage.

597
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,457
How come?

598
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,566
The staff had fled 3 days before.

599
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,171
They knew Serb troops were coming.

600
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,704
When we entered the orphanage,

601
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,380
it was the smell that...

602
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,554
And the silence.

603
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,400
We collected the dead children.

604
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,768
Others were still alive, semi-conscious.

605
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,570
Every time I smell dry piss
it takes me back.

606
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,384
They killed children?

607
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,529
I saw drunk militiamen, for kicks,

608
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:24,297
empty their clips into a school bus

609
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,392
full of children.

610
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,315
Jesus Ohrist!

611
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,353
The beer didn't agree with me.

612
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:53,729
You OK?

613
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,091
I feel better now.

614
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,243
We want to show you something.
It's low tide.

615
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,687
I'm alright.

616
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,420
We made a sea cemetery.

617
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:07,721
Each cross represents

618
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,526
a child we knew who was killed.

619
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,627
A child who'd come
to the camp every day.

620
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,057
We can't forget what we've seen.

621
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,897
But here at least

622
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,035
we can bearwitness.

623
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,063
At high tide, life goes on.

624
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:18,761
You can't see the kids.

625
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,509
That one's Ali.

626
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:31,273
Alittle boy of 9.

627
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,114
He'd come every day for cigarettes.

628
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,649
I gave him 2 each time.

629
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,918
By selling them,
he fed his family for 2 days.

630
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,967
One day he didn't come back.

631
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,171
Oart sleep?

632
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,986
You've hardly slept
since we left Montréal.

633
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:26,485
I'm not tired.

634
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,500
Thinking about him?

635
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,369
I can't remember anymore.

636
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,380
It happened so fast.

637
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,646
There are just pieces left,

638
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:55,247
little bits of that night.

639
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,621
As if it happened a century ago.

640
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,031
What happened?

641
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,804
Without warning,

642
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:17,869
he got meningitis.

643
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,218
Nothing you could do.

644
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,416
It went so fast.

645
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,629
He had a fever.

646
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:41,763
Lfigured it was anotherflu.

647
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,705
I did the usual.

648
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:48,174
I gave him Tylenol and put him to bed.

649
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,771
He went straight to sleep.

650
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,446
We'd go to hospital in the morning.

651
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,133
He neverwoke up.

652
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,669
You did what anyone would've done.

653
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,009
I'm not anyone.

654
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:32,549
I'm his father.

655
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,834
If I'd known, I'd have rushed him in.

656
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,730
But you're not a doctor, Gilles.

657
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,782
What can I do?

658
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,117
What can I do?

659
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,592
I wish I could tell you.

660
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,320
But I...

661
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,661
I don't know.

662
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,467
I'm not good at this stuff.

663
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,602
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you can do.

664
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,347
Try to sleep a bit, OK?

665
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,270
Oan you take this to Aunt Alberta?

666
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,012
Her birthday's coming.

667
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:14,689
Thanks.

668
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,216
It's all good.

669
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,782
I said we'd pay tomorrow.

670
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,709
Yeah, good luck!

671
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,123
Look, get some rest.

672
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,382
Think of ways to spend the money.

673
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,122
You alright?

674
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,266
Yeah.

675
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,887
Why, hello!

676
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:27,411
Hi.

677
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:28,983
How's it going?

678
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,125
- Good, and you?
- Sure.

679
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,427
I'm looking for Mr Lévesque.

680
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,285
Plenty of Lévesques here.

681
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,860
There are Lévesques down every road.

682
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,366
I guess.

683
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:42,129
The Lévesque I'm looking for works
for the rec department.

684
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,039
- Hold on. Oamille?
- Yeah?

685
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:48,142
Know a Lévesque who works for the town?

686
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:51,002
Must be Guy Lévesque,

687
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:52,541
a real asshole.

688
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,483
He's always at the baseball diamond.

689
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:59,151
When he's not in the bleachers
peeking under our skirts.

690
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:01,587
Thanks, girls.

691
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,323
Our pleasure.

692
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,122
Oan I help you?

693
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,762
No, big guy. Everything's chill.

694
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:11,900
Ohill?

695
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,570
What kind of fag expression is that?

696
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,803
It's a Montréal expression.

697
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,905
Oh, right, Montréal.

698
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:25,839
That's where they have
the fairy pride parade.

699
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,239
Yeah, that's right.

700
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:31,512
And Oocksucker Lake, too
on Mount Royal.

701
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:34,313
I've seen enough of you, tiny.
Beat it.

702
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:36,724
Jean-Pierre, you started.

703
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,086
You don't belong.

704
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,591
I'd be careful.

705
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,026
Well, thanks again, girls,

706
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:43,425
for the info. You're sweet.

707
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,534
And real pretty too,

708
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,870
really desirable.

709
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,832
My legs are all tingly.

710
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:53,937
My back's sweaty.

711
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,877
Lovely area, think I'll stay a bit.

712
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,413
Again, thank you and, it's chill!

713
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:32,653
Go, go, go!

714
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:34,486
It's going up!

715
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,792
Keep it up!

716
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:42,058
That's OK.

717
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,869
- Why hello!
- Hi.

718
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:45,767
- How are you?
- Good, you?

719
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,438
- Your daughter?
- Yup.

720
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,347
She's mine,

721
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,173
not Jean-Pierre's.

722
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,706
The fireman.

723
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,147
Oh yeah.

724
01:15:58,754 --> 01:15:59,914
What's your name, hon?

725
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:03,747
Momo!

726
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,018
It's Momo?

727
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,793
- Maude.
- Maude's nice.

728
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,153
She's shy.

729
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,628
That's allowed.

730
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,457
Hold on tight.

731
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:14,769
There you go!

732
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,238
Gee yap!

733
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,439
That's it, hold tight!

734
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,198
Good!

735
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:26,781
Hold on!

736
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:48,303
Well,

737
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,571
it could be cheap silver plate.

738
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,002
I can't tell if it's real
before I get it tested.

739
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:59,906
There's a risk for me,
so it's gonna cost you.

740
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,681
Oost me? I'm selling, not you!

741
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,346
Relax, kid.

742
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:06,854
I can only give an advance

743
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:09,848
till I know what I've got.

744
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,619
Real silver has a stamp on the back.

745
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,063
Awhat?

746
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,289
Real silver has a stamp.

747
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:20,868
Look.

748
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:22,430
How'd you know that?

749
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,372
My gran was a maid
at the Québec Oitadel.

750
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:26,796
Look, I'm busy.

751
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:29,436
Oheck it out. It says "sterling."

752
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:31,568
It's the real stuff.

753
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:35,142
Mr Lévesque,
if my partner says it's real silver,

754
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,651
then it's real silver.

755
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,314
Dish out the cash.

756
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:43,791
It's settled.

757
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,767
Gilles, how are you?

758
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,902
The transaction was a success.

759
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,165
Thanks to...

760
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,868
our business partner,

761
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:05,873
Miss Mélanie of Oabano.

762
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,847
- Hi.
- Her daughter Maude.

763
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:14,683
You go on.

764
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,389
I need a minute with Gilles.

765
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,424
I have to get back to the stand.

766
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,228
See you later?

767
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:23,554
Oome with me, Maude.

768
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,432
Get a load of this.

769
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:29,302
300 beautiful buckeroos.

770
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,233
You keep'em. I don't trust myself.

771
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,000
Wanna go for a beer?

772
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,175
I'll finish this one and walk a bit.

773
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,545
See you at the motel.

774
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,775
You're white as a sheet. Are you OK?

775
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:44,709
Yeah. See you later.

776
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,211
I'll be at the hotdog stand.

777
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:03,736
Where you been?

778
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,135
- With Maude.
- What about me?

779
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:09,405
- You're with your pals.
- Who'd I come with?

780
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,411
With my pals orwith you?

781
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,579
Why are you here?

782
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,649
Leave him alone!

783
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,217
I was just passing by.

784
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,277
Look, faggot,

785
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:23,347
beat it or
I'll hang you from our ladder!

786
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,417
For a fireman you're hotheaded.

787
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,321
Another clown!

788
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:34,696
Don't you get it?

789
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,464
I don't want to see your mug
around here.

790
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:42,100
Pack your crap,
get in your car and clear out!

791
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:44,543
Leave him alone!

792
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,442
If you want a beating, wait your tum.

793
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,947
Get the fuck out of here!

794
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,106
Oome on!

795
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,882
It's OK, Gilles.

796
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,818
Shut up, Bob.
Oome on, this'll be fun!

797
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:51,566
Quite a babe, huh?

798
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:55,298
Yup.

799
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,444
Don't get carried away.

800
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,782
I won't always be there to defend you.

801
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:10,648
I think I'm a little bit in love.

802
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,594
It's not love, it's an erection.

803
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:16,386
It's not the same.

804
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:25,466
She has a kid. What are you thinking?

805
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,803
To start a family?

806
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,050
She'd like to see me again.

807
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,551
Love, family...

808
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:47,691
they're not a free game
you win for being nice.

809
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,299
It's fate.

810
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,740
It takes over your life
and doesn't let go.

811
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,711
What have you done in life
besides wiping your ass?

812
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,347
Where are we?

813
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:51,949
Past Oacouna.

814
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,317
Why'd you stop?

815
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:57,296
Out of gas.

816
01:23:58,099 --> 01:23:59,088
Didrt you fill'er up?

817
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:01,858
Out of money.

818
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:04,567
What? I gave you $300.

819
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,830
I blew it.

820
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,266
Blew it?

821
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:13,341
You blew $300 last night?
How? Where?

822
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:18,718
I bought some oblivion in a bar.

823
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:01,660
Hi, Auntie.

824
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:03,597
Gilles!

825
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,562
My big boy!

826
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,237
How are you?

827
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:12,100
Just fine.

828
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:14,566
Hélêne's little boy!

829
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,904
Goodness, it's been so long!

830
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:19,906
Oome in, my boy.

831
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,647
Who's this handsome young man?

832
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:24,076
My friend Bob.

833
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:25,241
- Hello, Mr Bob.
- Hello.

834
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:27,986
- Oome in.
- Thanks.

835
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,757
What a lovely surprise.

836
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,320
- Here, a present from Alain.
- Thanks.

837
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,594
Oome in.

838
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:37,455
We're having a little party.

839
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,298
Let me introduce you.

840
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:42,867
Look who's here!

841
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:45,528
Who is it?

842
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:47,833
- Who is it?
- It's Gilles.

843
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:49,803
Hélêne's son.

844
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:51,878
And his friend Bob.

845
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:53,942
- I'm Madame Déziel.
- Hi.

846
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,776
They've come from Montréal.

847
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:56,951
Hi, Bob.

848
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,547
That's so sweet.

849
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:00,821
We're always visiting here.

850
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,748
What a lovely surprise.

851
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,566
Hello. Do you remember me?

852
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:15,903
Yes.

853
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,968
Madame Amyot?

854
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,911
Hello, Mr Lévesque.

855
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,913
Was it hard to find?

856
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:33,417
As long as you keep the river
on your left, you're fine.

857
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,452
Don't keep them standing there.

858
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:40,726
They're hungry.

859
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:48,702
Hi, Luc.

860
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,842
<i>When evening</i>

861
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:09,384
<i>descends on the green marsh</i>

862
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:13,158
<i>We shall listen to</i>

863
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,561
<i>the song of the golden wheat</i>

864
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,627
<i>We shall listen to</i>

865
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:27,005
<i>the song of the golden wheat</i>

866
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:33,072
I haven't sung in ages,

867
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,614
but I could hold that note before.

868
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:39,610
You still have a lovely voice.

869
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,015
I used to sing with them.

870
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,798
That was my First Oommunion.

871
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,125
Pretty dress.

872
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:57,669
It was pretty.

873
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:05,937
Goodness, the whole family.
Look how many we were.

874
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:09,648
They're almost all gone.

875
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:17,315
That's your great-uncle Henri.
A big traveller.

876
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:19,684
- I never knew him.
- No.

877
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:24,897
But your great-uncle Laflêche, yes.

878
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,823
Of course, Laflêche.

879
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:31,463
You used to cling to his shirttails.

880
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:34,207
He took you everywhere.

881
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:39,310
You'd come with your little bag.

882
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,278
He'd pick you up at the station
in Riviêre-du-Loup.

883
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:43,777
Always in a new car.

884
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:46,245
He could repair any engine.

885
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:48,919
The man was a mechanical genius.

886
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,982
You'd drive off in his big car

887
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,191
and tour the county, like a prince.

888
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,589
You were a little prince.

889
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,124
We'd tour my kingdom.

890
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:02,936
Yes.

891
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:07,264
He felt your dad neglected you badly.

892
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:10,434
He said that summer

893
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:13,804
was made for dads and sons
to play together.

894
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:16,750
He was so patient with you.

895
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,084
That's you, my boy.

896
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,724
When you left you'd say

897
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:33,625
you'd try to bring us back good news.

898
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,139
You again.

899
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:48,306
You visited often.

900
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,282
What an ugly tree!

901
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,451
We thought it was beautiful.

902
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:04,060
With all the presents under it.

903
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,764
Times were different.

904
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:07,759
Ahandsome lad.

905
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,801
Yourfriend seems to like the country.

906
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:19,610
He never leaves Montréal.

907
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,281
What did you do when you lost one?

908
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:36,486
We thanked the Lord for the healthy ones

909
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:39,265
and for calling the sick ones home.

910
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,568
We had to go on.

911
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,763
I had 6 others to feed.

912
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:49,437
Don't waste strength
on things you can't change.

913
01:30:57,852 --> 01:31:00,047
Expecting anyone else, Alberta?

914
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:11,189
It's the Maude squad!

915
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:13,322
Bob the snob!

916
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:19,262
Mme Alberta,
this is a friend from Oabano.

917
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:21,097
Hello!

918
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:22,409
Mélanie.

919
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:35,486
He's so good!

920
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,418
Your turn, babe.

921
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:56,510
OK, your turn.

922
01:32:00,448 --> 01:32:01,813
Is that legal?

923
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:03,973
Want to make it harder?

924
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,381
Like this, with my eyes shut!

925
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:18,031
You're good!

926
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:49,623
Where's everybody?

927
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,099
I dunno.

928
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:56,896
Here, a present.

929
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:04,278
Thanks.

930
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:30,158
It's tiny.

931
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,133
Look!

932
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,525
Pieces of old glass.

933
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:37,728
Beautiful colors.

934
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,939
There are lots there.

935
01:34:58,292 --> 01:34:59,486
What's that?

936
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:02,929
We hunted for seashells.

937
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:06,126
It's beautiful! Blue and green...

938
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,664
Where were you?

939
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:12,430
You don't leave a child alone
nearwater!

940
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:14,907
It's OK, Maude knows.

941
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,609
What's with you?

942
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:23,648
I'm sorry for you
but the world won't stop.

943
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:02,615
I'm sorry for before.

944
01:36:06,827 --> 01:36:09,057
You knew from the start we'd come here.

945
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:12,929
Maybe, I dunno.

946
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:17,327
You could've mentioned it then.

947
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:19,773
Yeah.

948
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:23,973
Our plan didn't pan out.

949
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,111
We're lousy robbers.

950
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:36,649
Mélanie wants to buy stuff for burgers.

951
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:38,891
I can't stand eel.

952
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,354
Want to come?

953
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:42,493
- Sure.
- Hop in.

954
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:45,658
Gille's coming along.

955
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,276
What's keeping him?

956
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,554
Want some fireworks for tonight?

957
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:10,285
- Yes, yes, yes!
- OK.

958
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,559
You're happy, huh?

959
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:38,245
They have lots.

960
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:43,046
Listen, but don't look at me.

961
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,148
Look out front.

962
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:54,434
For us?

963
01:37:54,668 --> 01:37:55,726
Seems like it.

964
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,438
Stay here with the girls.

965
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:02,402
What'll you do?

966
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:05,745
Bob who? I don't know you.

967
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,206
That won't work.

968
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:09,950
Trust me.

969
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:15,554
You don't have to do this.

970
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:19,491
Look after the girls.

971
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,935
Oount on me.

972
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:50,852
Sir!

973
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:53,293
Sir!

974
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:58,026
Suspect fleeing!

975
01:45:44,538 --> 01:45:45,505
Yes, hello?

976
01:45:59,152 --> 01:46:00,551
I'm going to Montréal.

977
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:04,218
Do what you have to do, my boy.

978
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,658
It's a good idea.

979
01:46:22,342 --> 01:46:23,604
Thanks for everything.

980
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,447
You're welcome anytime.

981
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:45,796
We can go.

982
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:46,933
Gilles Michaud?

983
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:49,068
That's me.
