1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,721
Bread?
Bread, Sir?

2
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,458
Generic bread,
tastes like medicine.

3
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,525
Bread?

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,228
Bread, uncle?

5
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,332
- What?
- The key.

6
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,035
I remember clearly, yesterday
you put it in your back pocket.

7
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,672
- My pockets are all in the front.
- Maybe your pockets changed places.

8
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,109
How can pockets move?
It's not like they're renting a room.

9
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,176
Okay, enough.

10
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,395
Try my new style of nastar
(sweet jam pastry), okay?

11
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,865
Man, what now?

12
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,635
Last week I had the runs,
because of your spicy nastar.

13
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,971
I guarantee it's safe,
come on.

14
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,547
What is this?

15
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,083
- Green Tea Nastar.
- Green tea?

16
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,155
Yeah, it's trending right now.
Everything is green tea.

17
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:31,291
Green Tea Bakpia Rolls,
 Green Tea Mini Cakes.

18
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,228
Miss Yu, not everything that is
trending needs to be made into nastar.

19
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,798
Original is better.

20
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,066
- Yes?
- Okay.

21
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,810
I'm a candidate for promotion
to the head office.

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,944
Seriously?

23
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,780
But its not for certain, right?

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,849
Yes, there is one other
candidate from Malaysia.

25
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,452
If you do get chosen,
that means?

26
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,254
Erwin Surya Brand
Director South East Asia".

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,459
Go order something,
lunch break is almost over.

28
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,895
Lunch break is over,
when I say it's over.

29
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:12,065
Hey, so who do you
think you are?

30
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,968
Erwin Surya Brand
Director South East Asia".

31
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,004
You're such a child.

32
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,406
- Uncle.
- Uncle Ali, let's fish.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,109
Maybe next time.
I'm really busy.

34
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,045
My son went to Bali with his wife and
I'm taking care of my grand-kid...

35
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,080
... while they're
making another child.

36
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,350
- Okay then.
- Hey wait.

37
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,654
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

38
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,391
- No cigarettes?
- Cigarettes!

39
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,594
- Alright, peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

40
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:47,868
<i>From smiles, laughter, and hope</i>

41
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,506
Dear, dear.

42
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,142
Get out.
Get out!

43
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,378
Don't act like you're all that.
Smacking my car.

44
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,480
Go call your friends in
those green helmets!

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,015
You think I'm one of
those online ojeks?

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,150
- You're not?
- Of course not!

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,851
- Well sorry!
- Why are you the one that's angry?

48
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,586
You're the one who's wrong,
doing whatever you like.

49
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,288
Does this country
belong to your father?

50
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:13,527
Well, no.
All I can do is work, work, work.

51
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,695
Enough let's go, come on.

52
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,434
- You're his passenger, miss?
- Enough!

53
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,103
Wouldn't you rather ride a taxi?

54
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,005
Mr. Nandar.

55
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,843
New business card,
new number.

56
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,581
Already waiting for me,
just on time.

57
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,084
My answer is still the same.

58
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,755
Relax, I came here just to
give you my business card.

59
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,124
New number.

60
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,330
Today you don't want to sell,
who knows tomorrow might be different.

61
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,199
You want Anita's number too?

62
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,036
Her number is 36D.

63
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,207
Thanks.

64
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,616
<i>Buckets for sale!
Buy one now!</i>

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,061
(Check the Store Nextdoor)

66
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,233
Bread!

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,568
Morning, Miss Tini.

68
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,205
Hey Mr. Kuncoro.
G'morning too.

69
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:37,611
Your voice Ms. Tin, so melodic.
Even the birds stop singing.

70
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,713
What are you talking
about Mr. Kuncoro.

71
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,922
- What if...
- Tini!

72
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,924
The boss is asking for toprak
(mixed vegetables in peanut sauce.)

73
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,225
What, tablecloth?

74
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,560
- Toprak.
- What?

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,296
Compressed rice, rice noodles,
tofu, peanut sauce.

76
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,032
Ketoprak?

77
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,101
Why didn't you say that.

78
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,102
Miss Tin.

79
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,771
She's mine.

80
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,341
Rohman Abdul Rahman,
I used to be a karate instructor.

81
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,977
The bird of Mr. RT?

82
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,713
- Karate Instructor.
- What is that?

83
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,482
Martial Arts from Japan.

84
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,186
The moment 1000
lightning-bolts strike!

85
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,493
What was he saying?

86
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,630
I don't know.
The signal kept breaking.

87
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,201
Downloading hasn't finished.

88
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,873
Ular, try saying "ular"!

89
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,576
Bro Amia, you're going
to make me faint.

90
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,444
All that sweat, did
you just do push-ups?

91
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,612
I'll take one, chocolate.

92
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,014
Plastic bag?

93
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,483
Why do you have to ask,
use one of course.

94
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,819
- Add 200 Rp then?
- You think you're a mini-mart?

95
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,923
What they call plastic isn't good for
the environment, you can't bicycle it.

96
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,924
What?

97
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,695
Bicycle, convert it to a reusable
item, you wouldn't understand.

98
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,863
Recycle!

99
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:08,468
Yeah, it's "cycle" too,
what's the problem?

100
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,971
Are you sure, it's okay?

101
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,641
It's okay just don't be too
late with the payments.

102
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,245
- I might end up dying first.
- My Lord.

103
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:23,049
That won't happen,
I'll pay all my debts next week.

104
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,150
Here.

105
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,554
Wait a moment.

106
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,857
It seems like last week the price for
this sweet soy sauce wasn't this high.

107
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:35,195
The agent raised it, if you don't
believe me check the store next door.

108
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,865
It's okay I believe you, I don't
really want to check next door.

109
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,066
Why?
Even more expensive?

110
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,069
No, next door they won't
let you pay later.

111
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,843
Baby.

112
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,711
- Boyfriend.
- Let's hurry.

113
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,748
- We want to have lunch.
- Okay, heading off.

114
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,749
Bye.

115
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,630
Hi Dad.

116
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,168
Yes, Ayu made nastar for you.

117
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,605
Thanks.

118
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,811
Dad.
Can we speak, inside?

119
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,081
It's like this.

120
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,817
This week I have a job
pre-wedding photos.

121
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:35,055
The budget is reasonable,
but I have to pay for the location...

122
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,591
... and there are supplementary
fees, paying for the crew.

123
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,463
Next week, after I'm paid
I'll return the money.

124
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,634
Don't make promises, if you're
not sure you can keep them.

125
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,968
How much?

126
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,107
10 million rupiah, father.

127
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,611
Alright, I'll transfer it.

128
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,413
Thanks Dad.

129
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,392
Hello, Win.

130
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,127
<i>Hi, Dad.
Are you well?</i>

131
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,595
I'm well.

132
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:22,202
So, unfortunately, I can't
attend the dinner this Thursday.

133
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,639
You can't stop by?
It's been awhile since we've gathered.

134
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,144
<i>I have to go to Singapore, I have 
an interview with the head office</i>.

135
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,916
If the interview goes well, I'll have
an office there in Singapore.

136
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,387
How come you have an interview
on the 24th of December?

137
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,988
 No Christmas break?

138
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,724
They want to finish
up interviews before...

139
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,360
... the New Year holidays,
hence the timing.

140
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:52,165
Alright, it's work
so what can I say?

141
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,433
<i>I'm so sorry Dad.</i>

142
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,903
We'll reschedule.
It'll be my treat, okay?

143
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,004
Yeah, sure.

144
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,078
Alright Dad.
I'm going to head home, okay?

145
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,085
- Hurry up, she's been waiting.
- Yeah I know, I know.

146
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,320
You okay?

147
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,892
It's just heavy,
I want to leave it but I can't.

148
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,996
Come in Win.

149
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,434
It's all good, Bu.
I'm ready to go.

150
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,402
Very good.

151
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,538
Any tips?

152
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,007
How should I say it?

153
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,845
You're sometimes
over-confident, Win.

154
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:44,083
I know you're confident because
you know you're right, but...

155
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,753
... people see you
like you're stuck up.

156
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,789
Be humble, Win.

157
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,693
Okay.
I'll try my best, thank you.

158
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,894
- Win
- Yes?

159
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,431
Do you have any recommendations
about who should be my secretary?

160
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,532
What's wrong with Ririn?

161
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,569
Ririn doesn't want to continue
after she gives birth.

162
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,605
I can try, what kind
of person do you want?

163
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,276
I would like someone diligent,
skillful, and honest.

164
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:15,849
Also someone who doesn't do drugs and
gamble, especially online gambling.

165
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,584
My neighbor would gamble
online in one day...

166
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,086
... she would lose
hundreds of dollars Win.

167
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,224
It didn't stop there they sold
their home, their motorcycle.

168
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,392
Until they sold their phone.

169
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,995
Until they couldn't gamble again,
Win god forgive them.

170
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,563
Okay.

171
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,500
Don't find someone
who likes to gamble.

172
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,336
- Yes.
- Okay, thank you.

173
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,071
- Thanks.
- Sure.

174
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,239
- Win
- Yes?

175
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,241
Remember, be humble bro.

176
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,876
Be humble Bro.

177
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,944
Mr. Afuk.

178
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,382
This is what you asked
for I bought it.

179
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,351
Here.

180
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,152
Good, right?

181
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,263
Whats wrong with it?

182
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,833
This is what he asked for a
small Christmas tree like this.

183
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,036
Yeah, but this is a Christmas
tree for a Minion.

184
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,905
How should I have known?

185
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,740
I've never celebrated
Christmas before.

186
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,310
I don't even celebrate
Lebaran often, once a year.

187
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,678
How come I celebrate
Lebaran twice?

188
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,879
You must have gone
to private school.

189
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,682
No, I went to public,
lebaran started at 7.

190
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,450
Okay but this is useless.

191
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,686
How will he decorate it?
With breaded nuts?

192
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:35,828
Is the store busy?

193
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,299
Yeah, it's pretty busy.

194
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,837
Your birthday is
coming up right?

195
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,073
What did you want to do?

196
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,244
Keep it simple,
it's not important anyway.

197
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,337
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry about it.

198
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,105
Did you need something Dad?

199
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,840
Dad!

200
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,845
It's nothing terrible
but just be wary, okay.

201
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,182
High blood pressure if not dealt
with can result in a stroke.

202
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:32,719
- Dangerous, right?
- What now, Doc?

203
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:37,523
Just keep an eye on his condition
don't get over-tired, over-stressed.

204
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,927
Most importantly don't
stay out too late.

205
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,832
Not like someone I know Mr. Warno.
He always likes going out at night.

206
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,834
I always tell him and remind him.

207
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:53,439
Mr. Warno don't stay out too late
it's not good for your health."

208
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,008
What does he say?

209
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,644
Mr. Cahyo, I have
to go out at night."

210
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,013
I sell Sekoteng.
(A warm ginger drink)

211
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,816
Mr. Warno,
such an old delinquent.

212
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,386
Alright, I need to
check nextdoor first.

213
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:10,123
There's an injured old man,
said he was fighting with his wife.

214
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,357
Is it bad Doc?

215
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,794
Just a scratch on his arm,
and scissors stuck in his cheek.

216
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,829
Alright I'll be
taking my leave now.

217
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,603
Excuse me, miss.

218
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,745
So our father has to end up in
a hospital just to see you.

219
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,484
Yeah I went to Singapore for
work it wasn't a vacation.

220
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,689
Ayu.

221
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,338
Dad.

222
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,809
Are you alright?

223
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,245
How was the interview?
Did it go well?

224
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,413
It went well.

225
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,615
Win.

226
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,055
This is the second time
this has happened.

227
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,393
I need to rest more.

228
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,994
I'm...

229
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,032
... no longer able
to run the store.

230
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,570
So you want to
sell your store?

231
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,006
I want you to be the one
to take care of me.

232
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,676
To take care of the store.

233
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,278
You will won't you?

234
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:42,982
One moment.

235
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:49,021
I need to pick up Natalie downstairs.
Be right back.

236
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,532
Dad.

237
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,703
I'll be happy to take care
of the store for you.

238
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:08,441
I want to hand the
store over to you.

239
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:14,547
But you, can't even take
care of your own life yet.

240
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:19,585
Right now you're only responsible
for one person, Ayu.

241
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:25,525
If you run my store, you'll be
responsible for all my employees.

242
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,163
Nat, this is bad.

243
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,597
Your father is in bad shape?
Hurry up, let's go.

244
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,633
It's not my father.
Here.

245
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,668
- What are you talking about, Win?
- Come here.

246
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,177
My father wants to retire.

247
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,346
He asked me to take
over the store.

248
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,347
What?

249
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,885
- That's terrible.
- See? Told you.

250
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,591
Why does it have to be you Win?
Why not Yohan instead?

251
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,161
You act as if you don't know
what their relationship is like.

252
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,832
What should I say?

253
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,370
- Get well soon.
- Thanks.

254
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,310
So how about it, Win?
Do you want to?

255
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:23,015
This is, a big decision.

256
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,186
I think I'll need some time
to think about it okay?

257
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:35,561
For as long as you've lived,
have I asked for anything from you?

258
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,899
Just try it out, one month.

259
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,501
One month?

260
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,238
I feel your mother
would also approve.

261
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,776
I promise.

262
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:56,015
If you don't like it,
I won't force you.

263
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,887
Okay.

264
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,023
Nat, Nat!

265
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,927
I told you, you should have asked
for some time to think about it.

266
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,395
I did, didn't you hear me?

267
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,530
I said I would like some
time to think about it.

268
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,866
Yes, but you also
agreed too, right?

269
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,637
Nat, he was talking about my mother.
What I was supposed to say?

270
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,639
Just relax okay.

271
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,411
Nat, Mrs Sonya probably
won't allow me anyway.

272
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,446
- I'll allow it.
- What?

273
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,617
But you won't receive
pay for the month.

274
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,120
The result of your interview
is still under review...

275
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,722
... by the Asia-Pacific
Hong Kong Headquarters.

276
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,693
So for the time being if you want to
take a vacation, take a vacation.

277
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,364
- What about my work here?
- Win.

278
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,402
My father is no longer here.

279
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,138
I'm sad.

280
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,708
His entire life I disappointed him.

281
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,645
Win, I used to...

282
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,252
Race!
Break dance on sidewalks!

283
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,754
Get drunk!
All kinds of things, Win.

284
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,123
I don't want you to be like me.

285
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,794
- I've never gotten drunk.
- Break dance on the streets?

286
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,696
Street raced?

287
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,432
My, your life is so boring, Win.

288
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,435
- Life is so boring?
- The point is...

289
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,138
... I don't want you to disappoint
your father, remember.

290
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,110
<i>The treasure that is
most valuable is...</i>

291
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,378
Come on, try.

292
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,548
- The treasure that's most valuable...
- I don't know that song, ma'am.

293
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,416
I should probably work on
my presentation, okay?

294
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,285
The one for next week
I need to prepare it.

295
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,420
- I have to...
- How could you not know that song?

296
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,022
It's from the TV series
Keluarga Cemarah.

297
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,225
- Featuring Adi Kurdi, Lia Waroka...
- I don't know it.

298
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,860
- Presentation Ma'am.
- Win!

299
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,097
Win.

300
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,265
Novie Kolapaking!

301
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,370
So naive.
C'mon Rin.

302
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,907
<i>The Treasure that is
most valuable is...</i>

303
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,044
You're naive too.

304
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,950
Always Erwin!
I know he's the favorite child, Yu!

305
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,552
He got a scholarship in Sydney,
his career is a success!

306
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:17,490
What then?
What has he contributed to the family?

307
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,126
You remember when
mother was sick?

308
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:25,364
It was me! I kept her company
every night, not Erwin!

309
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,869
But Dad could say that
Mom would agree that...

310
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,071
... Erwin should
take over the store.

311
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,574
Say something, Yu!

312
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,911
I don't want to say anything
if you're going to be like this.

313
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,280
Pointless.

314
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,268
Come down.

315
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,175
I understand that
you're disappointed.

316
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,211
But...

317
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,216
... he has the right to decide
what is best according to him.

318
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,523
It's okay for us to
try to change things.

319
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,695
But there are times...

320
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,400
... when we can only
accept the situation.

321
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,437
Stay strong.

322
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,114
<i>Nat.</i>

323
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,750
I don't know what I should
have said yesterday.

324
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,519
I'm so sorry.

325
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,389
Okay, Nat.

326
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,163
Hey, hey.

327
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,237
I don't want your
career to be bothered.

328
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,109
What should I say to my father?

329
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,881
I'll tell him that Mrs. Sonya
didn't give you permission.

330
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,717
I'm supposed to
lie to my father?

331
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,519
- He was talking about Mom...
- Okay, alright.

332
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:32,358
But after one month,
you'll return to the office, right?

333
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,726
Yes.

334
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,263
In one month I will
return to the office.

335
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,269
I promise.

336
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:48,274
- Okay, okay.
- I love you.

337
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,643
I love you.

338
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,578
You're already old
it doesn't suit you...

339
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,246
... if you were a teen
that makes sense.

340
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,814
Fatso, don't be envious.

341
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,884
Yeah Dinda,
one of my office friends.

342
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,153
Alright, I need to
continue my meeting first.

343
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,193
Better to act like a teen
instead of a Momma's boy like you.

344
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,028
Who said I was a Momma's boy?

345
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,031
<i>Ming, did you get
the chocolates?</i>

346
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,365
Yes, Mom!

347
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,036
How many bars did you finish?

348
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,604
This is only the second.

349
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,409
But I really want
to start dieting.

350
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,911
<i>Ming, did you want
fried breadsticks?</i>

351
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,146
I want some, Mom!

352
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,515
Relax speak softly
that's your mother.

353
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,228
If you're serious about
dieting, eat some fruits.

354
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,598
Papaya?
Are you a person or a parakeet?

355
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,800
Papaya?
Man, that's not manly.

356
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,802
It's orange and soft.

357
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,204
You know snake fruit?
There you go.

358
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:57,176
Dark, thorny, hard,
that's a manly fruit.

359
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,378
Vincent, so complicated.

360
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,214
Find something that doesn't
need to be peeled, easily cut.

361
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,751
- Tomatoes.
- Tomato is a vegetable Ming.

362
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,488
You're fool Aloy.
Tomatoes are a fruit.

363
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,858
Since the beginning of time
tomatoes have been a vegetable.

364
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,127
- Do tomatoes have seeds?
- They do.

365
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,763
Okay if they have seeds
then they're a fruit.

366
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,799
Enough that means everyone here is
a fruit too, alright lets play.

367
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,202
Hold on, now let me ask you.

368
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,204
If you go to a supermarket...

369
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,306
... are tomatoes on the fruit
rack or vegetable rack?

370
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,041
- Vegetable rack, all right, enough.
- See?

371
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,609
Even someone as dumb
as Vincent knows.

372
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,944
Hey, what?

373
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:36,348
Tomatoes are a fruit,
same with cucumbers.

374
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,785
What? Cucumbers are a vegetable, Ming.
Are you crazy?

375
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,655
Cucumber, tomato, soon enough
you'll be talking about JÃ­camas.

376
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,657
Well are JÃ­camas a
vegetable or fruit?

377
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,226
My Lord!

378
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:52,464
The point is if it has
seeds, it's a fruit.

379
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,634
You took science courses in highschool
like me, what's wrong with you?

380
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,137
But Vincent took science too,
and dropped out of college.

381
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,473
Why is this about me?

382
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,876
Han help me out, you
dropped out too right?

383
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:07,012
- Is JÃ­cama a vegetable or fruit?
- Whatever you want it to be.

384
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,883
What's up with you?
So pathetic today.

385
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,186
It's okay win or lose
it's normal, relax.

386
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,188
My father wants to retire.

387
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,957
That's great that means
you'll inherit his shop.

388
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,726
Wait, wait.

389
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,995
Don't tell me the one who
get's the shop is...

390
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,198
- Erwin?
- I don't agree with that.

391
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,467
You're the eldest son,
you should get it.

392
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,272
See that's true,
he is the eldest son.

393
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,108
It's okay, let Erwin
take over the store.

394
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,044
What does he know?
He'll make a mess of it.

395
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,281
The point is, even if you're some
poor chinese without a store...

396
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,049
... we'll still be your friend.

397
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,118
Damn you.

398
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,088
Thanks bro.

399
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,591
Enough before you two start kissing,
show your cards.

400
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,760
Look at this Ace, Ace.

401
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,563
- Tin tin.
- Yes, sir?

402
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,970
Go next door to Pak Mamat's shop
to buy double-sided tape.

403
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,506
Hey Mad, what else?

404
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,241
- "Kat-ay", boss.
- What?

405
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,976
- "Kat-ay"
- What is that?

406
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:15,214
- Knife that's tiny and cute.
- Cutter, buy one.

407
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,215
Yes.

408
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,217
Mr. Rohman anything else?

409
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,386
I would like you to be careful.
(heavy lisp)

410
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,754
Be careful.

411
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:23,622
Don't "buyu-buyu".

412
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:27,292
Buru-buru, talking
with you never ends.

413
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,697
- Hi Ms. Tin.
- Hey Mr. Kuncoro.

414
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,633
You don't have to be so
formal with me Ms. Tin.

415
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,270
You don't need to call me
Mr. Kuncoro, "Kuns" is enough.

416
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,772
Hey shaggy.

417
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,542
Kuns, it doesn't suit you,
You should be called "Coro."

418
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,544
Like a cockroach?

419
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,346
- He dies on his back.
- What's that like?

420
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,516
One more time?
Again, again.

421
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,918
- How's that?
- Cockroach.

422
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:58,390
Its okay Ms. Tin,
you can ignore those barbarians.

423
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,926
Where are you going?
I'll take you.

424
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,962
No need, I'm still too young.

425
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,531
Hey, hey.

426
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:10,002
What's going on?
Is this sexual harassment?

427
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,238
You too, I've been waiting
this entire time.

428
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,940
Okay then I'll be off, Sir.

429
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,945
Watch yourself, don't tease Tini.

430
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,381
What if she gets big, pregnant?

431
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,784
What? Pregnant?
My Lord, Sir.

432
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,888
I'm honest, holy, and clean.

433
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,757
Not one of those playboys
with different colored noses.

434
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,226
I don't care what
color your nose is.

435
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,728
The point is don't bother Tini!

436
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,268
Dummy.

437
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,374
It's okay, don't think about it.

438
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,644
What did I ever do to him?

439
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,815
It's not you, his store is
in competition with Mr. Afuk's.

440
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,485
What happened, my man?

441
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:05,257
Before only Mr. Nandar's store
was here, not Mr. Afuk's.

442
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,226
Why'd he move here?

443
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:12,030
Well during the '98 riots,
Mr. Afuk's store was looted.

444
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,665
Everything was lost.

445
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,669
In the end he started
all over again, here.

446
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,371
Attention everyone.

447
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:24,343
Erwin will be taking over the store.
I'm buying everyone pizza.

448
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,645
Pizza!

449
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,516
Pizza!? There's bread
right in front of you!

450
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,217
I'm buying everyone bread!

451
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,953
Cheap bread.

452
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,091
That's better, where can you
find coconut flavored pizza?

453
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,894
Boring.

454
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:46,198
Peace be upon you.

455
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:54,907
Everything good, Sir?

456
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,342
That's the problem.

457
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,279
You'll have to wait, God-willing
in two months you'll be paid.

458
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,647
It doesn't normally
take that long.

459
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:06,285
That's the problem, your invoice
can't be accepted immediately.

460
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,788
You have to register
as a new vendor.

461
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:14,660
I have to register as a new vendor?
I've received three jobs here already.

462
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,628
That's the problem.

463
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:23,168
Our boss has been replaced and
wants all vendors to re-register.

464
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,704
How about it, is there a problem?

465
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,643
This isn't a problem.

466
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,146
Heavenly breeze.

467
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,632
What's with you both?

468
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,737
We cannot lose to the
store next door.

469
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,007
How come there's no progress?

470
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,477
- Let's move forward.
- Forward.

471
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,850
Relax, relax, don't worry.
We have an idea, it's good.

472
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,485
Show me the result.

473
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,996
He must be sick.

474
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,898
- So what's the idea?
- No idea.

475
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,868
So you're just pretending.

476
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,872
Okay, I have an idea,
we'll make the theme "Zoo."

477
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,841
- That works.
- Yeah?

478
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,010
- We'll put an elephant here.
- Elephant.

479
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,645
- A camel here.
- Camel.

480
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,146
- A cat here.
- Cat.

481
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,950
Hey, there's no
cats at the zoo.

482
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,953
At the Private Zoo maybe.

483
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,822
My zoo is the public zoo,
it opens at 7.

484
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,626
Last time I went to the zoo, at the
shop there was a cat at my feet.

485
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,896
That's at the shop
not in the cage!

486
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:02,000
I have an idea, the theme
will be "Under the Sea."

487
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,971
That's good, imagine it
over here will be a whale.

488
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,640
Over here will be a
dolphin, over here a broom.

489
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,310
Man, my God.
Where in the ocean is a broom?

490
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,713
You know-it-all!
The ocean is vast...

491
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,616
... have you been to all of it?
Into all the nooks?

492
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,052
Of course there's a broom.

493
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:24,089
What crude unschooled men.

494
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,092
Terrible intelligence.

495
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,534
Hey, Mom.

496
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,737
Maybe father is correct.

497
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:46,578
As if I could take care of the store,
I can't even take care of my own life.

498
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,095
But I'm okay though.

499
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,964
As long as there's Ayu...

500
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,102
... I'll be okay.

501
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,740
- Dad.
- Win.

502
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,043
Everyone come here, you
still remember them right?

503
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,779
Naryo.

504
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,848
He's new Kuncoro.

505
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,751
This is Amyong.

506
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,089
- Ojak and Yadi.
- Mr. Afuk.

507
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,858
That's his father,
he already knows him.

508
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,527
Sorry, sorry.

509
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,530
Welcome, Sir.

510
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,299
Come along.

511
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:20,338
Hey your hand.
That's his son.

512
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,174
What are you doing?

513
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:28,146
You're not looking yeah?
There's a sweet-looking guy.

514
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,483
That's sweeter.

515
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,084
Where?

516
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:37,923
No thanks, I'd rather be
a virgin my entire life.

517
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:44,162
<i>My darling I love you, you know that
it's true (you know that it's true)</i>

518
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:48,934
<i>I will always be with you,
you know that I'll do</i>

519
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:57,008
<i>My love, I will always love you.
(Love you)</i>

520
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,646
<i>I will always be with you</i>

521
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:08,887
<i>Please, please, don't leave me</i>

522
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,390
Buying!

523
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,163
- Buy what?
- "Petsin."

524
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,302
- Dad, we sell gas here?
- "Petsin!"

525
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,172
How about buying tissues?
Seems like you need...

526
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,312
Here, MSG.

527
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,482
Thanks.

528
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,425
- Here dad, the money from him.
- No need.

529
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,263
For you, your first payday.

530
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:11,316
<i>My darling I love you, you know that
it's true ( you know that it's true )</i>

531
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:15,987
<i>I will always be by your side</i>

532
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:23,061
<i>And I'll say
Please, please, don't leave me</i>

533
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,996
<i>Yeah</i>

534
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:30,302
<i>Don't leave me
I won't live</i>

535
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:33,838
Who are you?

536
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,043
You're so handsome,
like a Korean film star.

537
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,713
- Thanks.
- I want to pay what I owe.

538
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,450
My, if it's about payment
you come out, right?

539
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,485
Count it, count it.

540
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,689
You don't trust me?
Do you have to count it?

541
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,459
You're taking so long, like this.

542
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,434
Mrs. Ida.

543
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,436
How come it's only 1.2
million rupiah ($90)?

544
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,604
Yesterday, wasn't it
1.4 million ($105)?

545
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,941
How is it 1.4 million?
It was 1.2.

546
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,278
That's what I remember, check the
receipt if you don't believe me.

547
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,681
- Myong
- Yes?

548
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,116
Where's Mrs. Ida's receipt?

549
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,919
You're the one that stored it.

550
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:29,527
Okay then,
1.2 seems correct, sorry.

551
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,935
When I look at you I
want to pinch you.

552
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,538
I'll introduce you to my
younger sister Ebet, okay?

553
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:45,143
Her body is just
like mine, so good.

554
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,679
Good? A round and compact body?
How's that good?

555
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,713
Interested?

556
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:50,949
I'll think about it?

557
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,118
Yeah?
What's "tentative" mean?

558
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,619
Okay then, I'll take my leave.

559
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,055
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

560
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,593
One more thing, milk coffee, the
delicious one, so I won't be tired.

561
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,228
- Do you have any?
- Yes, we do.

562
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,196
- Naryo.
- No need.

563
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,565
Okay.

564
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,902
Put it on my tab.

565
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,841
- Hi Nat.
- <i>Hi, how are you?</i>

566
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,879
Tired, very.

567
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,382
It's only been a week.
How was today?

568
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:29,054
Business as usual,
so many weird things happening but...

569
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,056
... it's fun.

570
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,892
Don't forget about
your office work, Win.

571
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,896
You said you wanted to be
Brand Director of South East Asia.

572
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,699
Yeah? You're that afraid that
I wont return to the office?

573
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,237
Are you that ashamed, if
you have to date a grocer?

574
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:51,342
I'm not ashamed,
just not mentally prepared.

575
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,745
How about you?

576
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,847
How was work?

577
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,251
Well, today Mr. Albert was
yelling at the office.

578
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,322
<i>Alright Din, you should go home.
I'll clean up.</i>

579
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,356
Yes Ma'am.

580
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,395
- Hey.
- Hi.

581
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,099
Good?

582
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,670
Good, but there are plenty
of cheese sticks left.

583
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:22,373
And the nastar are nearly finished,
so I have to make more.

584
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:26,177
Seems like you'll be able
to open a bakery soon.

585
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,579
Amen.

586
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,382
Then I can relax at
home watching DVDs.

587
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:37,489
Relax? If I have a bakery
you'll deliver the cakes.

588
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,658
- Why's that?
- You're an online ojek, aren't you?

589
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,166
Mr. Erwin what food would you like?
I'll buy it for you.

590
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,135
Don't worry about it.

591
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,604
I'll head out myself and find
something to eat, not a problem.

592
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,440
Mr. Erwin don't go out too often.

593
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,542
You'll get too much of the hot sun.

594
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,079
Your creamy fair skin
will end up dark.

595
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,482
Thank you for caring about the
color of my skin, but it's okay...

596
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,017
... I'll go myself, okay?

597
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,520
What about a drink?
Do you want a drink?

598
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,822
No, no need.

599
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,391
What about my telephone number?
Do you want that?

600
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:18,129
- Come here.
- My number is 0854...

601
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,801
Dad, for these receipts
how about we use this...

602
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,603
... tablet instead?
To make things easier?

603
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,105
- Tablet? Medicine?
- Yes.

604
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,373
No, not that.

605
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,476
This is a computer tablet.

606
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,150
- Hi Ren.
- Hi.

607
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:43,821
Okay.

608
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,958
- Five minutes?
- Yes.

609
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,529
So, my father died last month...

610
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,566
... and I've just returned from
Jogja taking care of things.

611
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,834
It's okay, Mom is doing alright.

612
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:02,507
My father has a house for
rent there, it's small but...

613
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:06,110
... it's located right next to
a popular hotspot Kaliurang.

614
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,178
You know it right?

615
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:12,850
Strategic, perfect for a bakery.

616
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,353
Your dream, right?

617
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,494
I won't get involved.

618
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:29,901
And you won't need to pay rent.
We'll just split the profits.

619
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,747
Think about it, okay?

620
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,750
Bye.

621
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:59,631
Only this much is complete?
Next week is when we'll be evaluated.

622
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:04,535
This is pretty good, look at it.
The theme is "Under the Sea." Look.

623
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,572
- Under the sea?
- Yes, this is a whale here.

624
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,575
This is a shark.
This is an octopus.

625
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,945
What a ruin.

626
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,948
Ruin?
The sunken ruins of the Titanic.

627
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,416
You jump, I jump.

628
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,386
What is that, then?

629
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,188
It's Spongebob.

630
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,190
Spongebob lives at the
bottom of the sea, right?

631
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,927
He doesn't live in government
housing obviously, right?

632
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,262
I'll just fish here then.

633
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,133
Why here?

634
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,740
I think he's sick again.

635
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,210
What did I say?
He didn't like Spongebob.

636
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,247
Okay, let's smile this time.

637
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,784
- One, two.
- Hey wait, is my hair okay?

638
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,485
- It is.
- Great.

639
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,921
- Alright, let's do this.
- Hey wait, wait.

640
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,157
- What is it?
- This is a color photo, right?

641
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,792
- Yes.
- Great!

642
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,494
Make sure it's not blank and
white, so we don't look poor.

643
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,829
Right sweety?

644
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,398
Yes, that's right.

645
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:11,002
- Okay, Look at each other.
- Stop, wait.

646
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,837
What is it?
Stay there.

647
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,006
Wait, hold on.

648
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,044
- I want to take a look.
- Man.

649
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,513
We'll take plenty of photographs,
you can look at all of them after.

650
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,415
It's becoming overcast.
The photos won't turn out great.

651
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:28,486
What if I look ugly?
I want to see, so stingy.

652
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,722
Okay Alright, here.

653
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:34,492
See! I'm fat!
What's wrong with you.

654
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,027
It's good that I checked.

655
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,930
- Do it properly.
- Sure, okay.

656
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,666
- Quickly, hurry up.
- Alright, let's hurry Bill.

657
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,700
Ready?

658
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,402
Yes, look at each
other intimately.

659
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:47,705
- Now look forward one, two.
- Stop, stop!

660
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,441
What now?
Just stay there.

661
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,211
I want to look again,
to see if I look fat or not.

662
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,347
See! I'm still fat!
What's wrong with you?

663
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,149
Pretty, what is it?

664
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,952
- Come here, handsome.
- There's nothing, just stay there!

665
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,353
- Don't move.
- Man, what's going on?

666
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,290
- My friends said you were good.
- My photo looks terrible, I look fat.

667
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,394
What's with you?
I told you I didn't want him.

668
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:12,397
- There are better photographers.
- Come on take better photographs.

669
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:14,732
I don't want to take any more
pictures here like this.

670
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,469
- I don't want to do anymore with him.
- Alright we'll try once more.

671
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,738
Okay, let's continue.

672
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:24,509
- This is my good side.
- Okay, your left, alright.

673
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:25,810
Come on Bill, hurry up!

674
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,651
- What is this?
- This Sir, is artistic.

675
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,154
Aristick, aristick what?

676
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,790
- Artsy Sir, it's art.
- Art.

677
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,392
Need to make it more artistic
than the store nextdoor.

678
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,128
- Okay?
- Ready, just leave it to me.

679
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,129
Tin.

680
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:51,002
Yes Sir, I'm serving these guys
these guys that aren't buying.

681
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,741
Next door, there's someone helping
Mr. Afuk, a new employee?

682
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,309
Mr. Erwin?

683
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,112
- Erwin? Mr. Afuk's youngest?
- Yes.

684
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,413
He's impressive.

685
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,950
Didn't he go to
university somewhere far?

686
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,886
- Sidney (sounds like here) Sir.
- Not here, outside the country.

687
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,423
- Sidney (sounds like here) Sir.
- The place with kangaroos.

688
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,660
Kangaroo (sounds like Mr. Teacher)
kangaroo, Mr. Haj that's a teacher.

689
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,094
Sydney.

690
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:21,799
- Sydney, Australia?
- That's the one.

691
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,337
You must've found out
from that Coro right?

692
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,439
Coro, Coro again.

693
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,743
Go on then, do your
work properly.

694
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,746
Tini, Tini.

695
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:38,115
Nandar, Nandar.

696
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,120
Hey! Pay attention!

697
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,355
Who is that?

698
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:21,392
A developer wants to buy this land
but I'm not interested in selling.

699
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,129
- Good Afternoon Mr. Nandar.
- Hi Mr. Nandar.

700
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:26,964
How are things?

701
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,833
Tight.

702
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:33,771
I mean my business is tight.
Don't bother me.

703
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:37,475
My boss told me to pass
on good tidings to you.

704
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:40,444
He's offering this time,
twice as much.

705
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,214
I don't want to sell,
no matter the price.

706
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:47,852
Are you sure?
Our offer is very large, see?

707
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,788
Yes, so large.

708
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:55,059
But the point is I will not be
tempted into selling this store.

709
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,061
Mr. Nandar, think about it first.

710
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,463
If you rush into a decision,
you'll regret later.

711
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,299
- Yeah, Sure.
- Okay, let's go.

712
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,490
Mr. Afuk, are you well?

713
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,193
I'm well of course.
One moment.

714
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:34,699
I bring good tidings,
my boss is offering twice as much.

715
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,335
I'm giving this store to my son.

716
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,140
- Bro, Afuk Jr.
- Erwin, my name is Erwin.

717
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,245
You tell your father, please.

718
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,482
I don't want him to regret later.

719
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,087
Alright, I'm off for now.
Where are we going now?

720
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,889
We have a meeting
at City Hall...

721
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:02,059
... after that we have dinner
reservations with Mr. Jamil.

722
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,061
Mr. Jamil.

723
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:07,932
He's from Abu Dhabi, but his name is
the same as my friend, from Depok.

724
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,735
- Let's go.
- We're off, Mr. Erwin.

725
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,576
What a miracle.

726
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,546
Actually, two miracles.

727
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,488
She left already.

728
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,392
It's good, right?

729
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:38,295
My mom bought it yesterday
at a church auction.

730
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,966
- We're gambling, Ming.
- So?

731
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,636
Don't you know?
Gambling is a sin.

732
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,339
It's just small change,
how's that a sin?

733
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,807
 He'll understand.

734
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,243
But not with him looking
at us like this Ming.

735
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,845
Yeah, it's like we're
watching a porn...

736
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,014
... and your mother joins
you, it's awkward.

737
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,150
You understand Ming,
just take it down.

738
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:03,721
Or change it with the god of gambling
Chow Yun Fat, that would work.

739
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,857
As if, if my mother found
out it would be a nuisance.

740
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:11,062
Enough, so you all calm down
before we deal let's pray first.

741
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:14,999
Give me your hand,
come on quickly.

742
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,767
Here.

743
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:19,804
Lord.

744
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,506
Repeat after me.

745
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,277
- Lord.
- Lord.

746
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:31,015
- Forgive us for our sins today.
- Forgive us for our sins today.

747
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,285
- We did not mean to do evil.
- We did not mean to do evil.

748
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,886
- <i>Aming!</i>
- <i>Hold on!</i>

749
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,321
Hold on.

750
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,359
- Hopefully you will forgive us.
- Hopefully you will forgive us.

751
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,796
- And hopefully Aming will win often.
- And hopefully Aming will win often.

752
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,031
Amen.

753
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,935
I'm feeling good today,
let's do this.

754
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:54,739
How's Erwin doing at the store?
It's been two weeks, right?

755
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,575
You should check to see
if there are any waves.

756
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,978
I'm still curious as to why
you didn't get the store.

757
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,379
Is it because...

758
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,183
- What?
- Is it because you were in jail?

759
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,252
He was imprisoned for
only three months...

760
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,654
... he was just a
prisoner-in-training.

761
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,058
You should be grateful he was
only held for three months.

762
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:18,829
It was just weed,
ecstasy is really troublesome.

763
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:23,300
- Can we change the topic?
- <i>Ming, do you want ice-cream?</i>

764
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,736
No, thank you.

765
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,673
I want some Mom.
Not too much, just three scoops.

766
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:33,310
Also don't use condensed milk.
I'm on a diet.

767
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,314
What?

768
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,018
So, anything new?

769
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,489
- Mr. Robert came to the store again.
- Robert?

770
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:51,162
Yes he's developer, properties.
He wants to buy my father's store.

771
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,963
Then?

772
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:57,468
- He doesn't want to sell it.
- Why?

773
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,371
Yeah.

774
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:06,310
He took care of that store with my
mother, it has sentimental value.

775
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:10,014
Yes but if the value is great,
why not?

776
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:11,081
Well.

777
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,020
Money can't always buy
everything I guess.

778
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,927
Whereas, if your father
sells the store...

779
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,462
... there's no longer any
problems right, Win?

780
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,665
You would be free.

781
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:30,234
You wouldn't have to
take care of anything.

782
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,471
Yohan too, he would have
nothing to be envious about.

783
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,609
- Everything would be sorted.
- Nat.

784
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,146
It's already cut.

785
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,249
It's hard.

786
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,354
Done.

787
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,427
<i>It's okay Ma'am, you may open it.</i>

788
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,463
Looks good.

789
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:08,172
Relax Mr. Afuk, you didn't like
the other theme "Under the Sea."

790
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,641
- So we changed it.
- What did you change it to?

791
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:11,909
Bottom of the Pond.

792
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,947
He's sick again.

793
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,054
- Di.
- Yes?

794
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:27,424
What's wrong?
You can tell me from there.

795
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:31,095
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine, just feeling weak.

796
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,831
Normally I eat nasi uduk
(steamed rice with coconut milk.)

797
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,566
- Today?
- Fried Rice.

798
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,735
Okay, you look pale.

799
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,537
No Sir, I just look like this.
Ugly.

800
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,713
What now?

801
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,050
Ojak and Yadi keep making
terrible displays.

802
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,321
- Tomorrow is the evaluation.
- What's the prize.

803
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:59,790
It's decent,
10 million rupiah ($750.)

804
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,694
If we win, I want to
split it with everyone.

805
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:04,795
Not bad, right?

806
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,878
(<i>How about it, Yu?</i>)

807
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:36,961
What's this then?

808
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,897
You don't feel anything odd, do you?

809
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,168
There's money here.

810
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,339
Does my lovely wife
want to buy a new bra?

811
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,674
Hey, your father first.

812
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,078
I'm not sure if my father
would want to wear a bra.

813
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:57,781
I'm serious, pay back what you
owe to your father first.

814
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,783
Mrs. Yu, you're no fun.

815
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,753
I'd rather not be
exciting, so our life...

816
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,456
... is comfortable,
peaceful, without debt.

817
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,226
Pay your father back.

818
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:12,529
Then we pay our rent.

819
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,732
Then the rest you can
do whatever with.

820
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,602
I want to dress up my wife.

821
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,537
Normally you make your
motorcycle pretty.

822
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,339
But the motorcycle
can't give me warmth.

823
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,440
It can.

824
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:25,843
The exhaust has a hole.

825
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:27,745
It would blister then?

826
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,516
<i>Makmur Abadi Store. </i>

827
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:34,518
What's the concept?

828
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:38,789
- This is artistic, Sir.
- Where? Where's the art?

829
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,791
It's artsy, Sir.

830
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:44,795
- Art, but where is it?
- Where?

831
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,530
This is an "apatelment."

832
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,733
- Bag of cement?
- Bag of cement from, wait, where?

833
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,235
No.

834
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,572
- Places for rent to live in.
- Rental homes.

835
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,710
Okay then, just
declare us the winner.

836
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,779
What's clear is the rest don't
need to be evaluated...

837
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,414
... this one is clearly the best.

838
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,858
- Mr. Afuk?
- Are you ready?

839
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,693
All ready, just a little bit more.

840
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,896
- Today is hot, right?
- A little bit.

841
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:21,999
- Drink?
- Sorry we can't be bribed.

842
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:24,935
- It's unfair, not fair at all.
- One bottle, my pride.

843
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,437
Okay this works.

844
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:30,474
For our pride to be balanced
we need the same thing.

845
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:31,642
Win?

846
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:33,043
It's done, please.

847
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,178
- Done?
- Yes.

848
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,347
It's done?

849
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,883
- That's a great moon.
- Sun.

850
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:41,952
Why the sun?

851
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:45,355
In religion, the sun
is a symbol of hope.

852
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,658
So for this new
year we hope...

853
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,928
... everything will be
better more prosperous.

854
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,097
So we already have a sun here.

855
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:55,699
If we have free time,
let's add Teletubbies, okay?

856
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,836
- Good idea, right?
- You're right.

857
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:03,040
There's Tinky-Winky,
Dipsy, Lala, Karmela.

858
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:09,613
Erwin Surya.
Surya "sun", I can't believe it.

859
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:11,949
You're the one who
named me, right?

860
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:18,021
Han, Han!
Look at this, isn't it beautiful?

861
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:21,992
- Why?
- Look, Erwin made this.

862
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,496
He brings luck, this kid.
It's great, right?

863
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:26,497
Yes, it's great.

864
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:29,700
Have you checked the
store next door?

865
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,968
We have.

866
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,970
- Which one is better?
- This one, right?

867
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,138
This one is better.

868
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,673
- For now, this one is the best.
- Secured, then?

869
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:38,242
- You're safe.
- Safe.

870
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:39,943
So...

871
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:45,716
So, as I was saying...

872
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:47,885
This is the money
that I borrowed.

873
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,786
No need,
don't worry about it, it's done.

874
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:51,488
Seriously?

875
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:56,126
Enough, who is my money for,
if not for my children?

876
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:57,561
Hold onto it.

877
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,639
Our display won!

878
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,692
- Hi Win.
- Our display won!

879
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,662
<i>There was a display
contest at our store.</i>

880
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:35,132
We won 10 million rupiah that we'll
split between the employees.

881
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:36,233
Okay.

882
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,469
- Congratulations.
- <i>Yes, thank you.</i>

883
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:43,907
Alright then, its really loud here.
Our store won! Bye bye.

884
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:44,975
See you.

885
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,648
Our store?

886
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:56,186
- There's Mr. Pri.
- Yeah.

887
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,888
Mr. Pri.

888
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,391
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Mr. Yohan.

889
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,527
- Okay Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

890
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,570
Hi Mom.
Erwin is doing well, at the store.

891
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,975
It's been a long time since
I've seen father so happy.

892
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:21,345
I'm still a photographer.

893
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:26,450
Even Ayu here.

894
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:32,289
Her pastries are selling so well Mom
you didn't pick wrong in her.

895
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,094
If only Dad had the same idea.

896
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,635
Wan.

897
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:46,770
Wan.

898
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,807
Big-bro Yohan, big-sis Ayu.

899
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,712
My dad isn't here, how about
I make your ketoprak.

900
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,981
Are you able to reach up there?

901
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,251
It's easy, I'll reach it.

902
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:04,621
The usual?
One spicy, one normal?

903
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,590
Okay.

904
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:14,364
Dear.

905
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:23,073
You know right, that I really
want to have a bakery of my own.

906
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,945
Yes.

907
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,082
Your own bakery.

908
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,518
My own photo studio.

909
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:37,387
It'll happen one day.

910
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:47,064
Last week Reno came to the cafe.

911
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,937
He told me, he inherited
a house in Jogja.

912
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:58,508
It's small,
but in a strategic location.

913
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:06,550
He asked if I wanted to
open a bakery with him.

914
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:11,621
We'll split the profits and
we won't have to pay rent.

915
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,197
You've said that you
were bored of Jakarta.

916
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,775
All my clients are here.
If we move to Jogja...

917
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,811
... we'll have to start
all over again?

918
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:39,716
Also, who will take
care of my father?

919
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:50,260
This is because of Jogja, right?
Not because of Reno?

920
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,665
Who's the jealous one?

921
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,101
You, right?

922
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,671
Yu.

923
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,610
To help realize your
dreams is my duty.

924
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,279
Not someone else's.

925
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,356
Wan, where's my ketoprak?

926
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:23,360
- One moment, I've almost reached it.
- What's happening to my ketoprak?

927
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,429
Man, I can do this.

928
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:28,064
- Excuse me.
- There's a guest.

929
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,201
- Guest?
- Yes, a guest.

930
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:32,869
Yes?

931
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,938
Excuse me, this is
New Victory Store, right?

932
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:38,408
- Yes, may I help you?
- I have a delivery.

933
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,744
- This?
- Yes.

934
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,414
There.
Good, right?

935
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,450
What is this?

936
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,485
Your store's sign, what did you
think it was, a tombstone?

937
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:49,886
No, did you deliver
to the wrong place?

938
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,556
Wrong delivery?
Like an SMS.

939
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:53,924
Yes this is an address.

940
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,526
The New Prosperous Store, there.

941
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,362
Ordered by Afuk.

942
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,700
What a tacky name,
are you Afuk?
943
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.901
No.
944
01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:07.103
It's okay you can admit it,
you don't have to be ashamed.
945
01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:10.073
Hey, Afuk!

943
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,942
Where are you going?
Changing your name?

944
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:14,544
Hey, are you kid or an adult?

945
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,012
Shut up, Afuk's friend.

946
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:19,115
You're wrong here too, this billboard,
how come it's "liater."

947
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,252
- Should be "retail", it's wrong.
- Are you drunk!?

948
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:25,555
Read it from here!
Call Afuk here.

949
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,494
What are you making?

950
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:32,896
A will?

951
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,133
I don't plan on
dying anytime soon.

952
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,970
If you want to first,
please go on ahead.

953
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,910
Love at the Store Next door.

954
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:49,746
Wait a moment.

955
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:55,352
As the sun dawns.
And our rolling doors race."

956
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,321
So uncivilized.

957
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:02,559
Kun, if you want touch
a woman's heart...

958
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,861
... ask the most feminine here.

959
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,536
As if you're feminine.

960
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,739
Your beard is like the carpet
for an indoor stadium.

961
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,319
Is this real?

962
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,555
You were accepted?

963
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,929
So when do you start?

964
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,364
If I go through with it,
the start of next month.

965
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,399
Wait, wait.

966
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,203
What do you mean "if?"
Why would this not happen?

967
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,673
Who said it wont happen?
It will happen.

968
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,274
- It's just...
- It's just what? What?

969
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:54,878
I need to talk to my father,
I haven't spoken to him.

970
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,846
All you have to
say to him is...

971
01:01:56,846 --> 01:02:00,050
... the agreement was for
one month only, right?

972
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,184
Then?

973
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,787
Show a little empathy.
It's not that easy.

974
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:06,623
Yes, the agreement was for
only one month, but I...

975
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,492
Imagine if you had
to tell your father.

976
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:10,627
Okay, Win.

977
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:12,662
He has a lot of hope
in me, you know that?

978
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,505
Okay Win, hey.

979
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:27,477
I know you can do it.
Okay?

980
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:35,218
<i>Are you sure?</i>

981
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,325
The other employees
really like you.

982
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,861
You could be a really good boss.

983
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,933
If I'm successful in Singapore,
you'll be proud too, Right?

984
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,669
I don't need you to be
successful in a different country.

985
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,105
I want you here.

986
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,575
Taking care of what your mother
and I created from nothing.

987
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,218
You already promised,
one month.

988
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,420
One month.

989
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:14,824
If I don't enjoy it,
you wouldn't force it, correct?

990
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,962
- I won't force you, I just...
- Just what?

991
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:21,464
Just what?

992
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,968
You want me to feel like
I'm making a mistake?

993
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,140
Yes.

994
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:32,676
You're right.

995
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,078
I'm the one that's wrong.

996
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:42,519
It seems when you
have a lot of hope...

997
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,921
... you have to be prepared
for a lot of disappointment.

998
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,026
Forgive me, okay?

999
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53,196
Dad.

1000
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:01,304
<i>This is the end of the story</i>

1001
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:05,975
<i>We have to go our own way </i>

1002
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,213
<i>Everything</i>

1003
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,919
<i>Is still remembered</i>

1004
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,792
<i>Search for everything</i>

1005
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,696
<i>A missing purpose</i>

1006
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:34,170
<i>Since you departed</i>

1007
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:38,708
<i>Leaving me here</i>

1008
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:46,549
<i>"Yes, I'm sure.
Yohan and I can't leave Jakarta."</i>

1009
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,320
<i>Would you have let me go</i>

1010
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:57,193
<i>Cause I'm still running to you</i>

1011
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:02,198
<i>Don't you stop</i>

1012
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:07,137
<i>Everything isn't over</i>

1013
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:12,609
<i>Even though my tears</i>

1014
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:18,414
<i>keep falling</i>

1015
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:24,654
<i>Remain here</i>

1016
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,526
<i>Don't you leave</i>

1017
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,929
I've prepared your
severance pay.

1018
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:37,333
What's inside is based on
how long you've worked here.

1019
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,570
I'm done for,
I just started.

1020
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:46,543
<i>Cause I'm still running to you</i>

1021
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,353
Alright, go on then.

1022
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,199
What will I do next, hm?

1023
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,302
Stand-up comedy?
You look just like Panji.

1024
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:15,738
- Better off drawing with sand.
- Watch out for cat shit.

1025
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:20,877
Mr. Afuk, the only people
left that didn't sell was us.

1026
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:25,215
If this is how it is,
I won't have a friend anymore.

1027
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:33,089
And, don't you feel sorry for all
those small shops, our customers?

1028
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,960
They have to travel far
to go to the markets.

1029
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:40,129
I've already signed
the sales contract.

1030
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,397
My goodness.

1031
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,404
Mr. Nandar, I'll leave all
my customers in your care.

1032
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:51,908
- Including Ms. Wilda.
- My goodness.

1033
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:57,080
Drink first, have some cake too.

1034
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,748
This is my house.

1035
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:05,021
<i>After all that time</i>

1036
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,892
<i>Tears left behind</i>

1037
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:11,194
Thank you, Sir.
I'll be off then, Sir.

1038
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:18,234
<i>All these memories</i>

1039
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:23,706
<i>A beautiful time</i>

1040
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:29,412
<i>A time we were together</i>

1041
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:36,853
<i>A feeling deep inside
that will never weaken</i>

1042
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:45,528
<i>Forgive me for never listening</i>

1043
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:53,503
<i>Forgive me for never watching you go</i>

1044
01:07:53,937 --> 01:08:01,411
<i>I want you here</i>

1045
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:06,983
<i>Head held high I'll get through it</i>

1046
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:13,556
<i>Let go
Let go of everything in the past</i>

1047
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:18,895
<i>But I can't keep running</i>

1048
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:24,834
<i>Without you, without my legs</i>

1049
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:30,940
<i>Time goes by</i>

1050
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:36,579
<i>But I won't stop hoping</i>

1051
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:44,153
<i>Seeing your smile, even the tiniest</i>

1052
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:52,862
<i>Forgive me for never listening</i>

1053
01:08:53,463 --> 01:09:01,004
<i>Forgive me for never watching you go</i>

1054
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:08,277
<i>I want you here</i>

1055
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,080
<i>Be strong</i>

1056
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,762
How could he relapse again?

1057
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:29,298
I think, it's because of this.

1058
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,904
Land Purchase Agreement

1059
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,277
It seems he's really
disappointed...

1060
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,179
... Erwin didn't want to
continue the store.

1061
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,120
Could you wait outside for a bit.

1062
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,127
Satisfied?

1063
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,769
- What did I do?
- What did you do?

1064
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,038
You disappointed Dad,
don't you know?

1065
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,341
I'm going to be promoted to
the Southeast Asia office.

1066
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:14,510
Am I supposed to turn them down?
Am I insane?

1067
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,745
So egotistic.

1068
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,115
You'll have lots of time
to think about yourself!

1069
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:22,351
For now think about him, please.
He already trusts you.

1070
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:25,421
I never asked him to
entrust the store to me.

1071
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:28,491
If he trusts me and not
you, that's my fault?

1072
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,059
Everything is my fault.

1073
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:33,930
You couldn't deal with mom's death.
You dropped out of University.

1074
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,164
Is that my fault?

1075
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:39,268
You married Ayu against father's
wishes, is that my fault?

1076
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,971
Say one more thing
and I'll hit you!

1077
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:44,674
What is this?

1078
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,178
Fighting in a hospital?

1079
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,482
So if someone gets hurt you
can be admitted immediately?

1080
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:56,652
We'll step out and talk out there.
Let's go, let's.

1081
01:10:56,986 --> 01:11:01,390
You two!
What if your dad had heard you?

1082
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,594
Luckily he was given
sleeping pills.

1083
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:07,730
On top of that, why should an
older and younger brother fight?

1084
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:13,069
All these years I've never fought with
my older or younger siblings.

1085
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:15,872
Of course I'm an only child.

1086
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:17,707
- Good Evening, Doc.
- Evening.

1087
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:19,909
- I've got this.
- I'll leave them with you.

1088
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,811
- I have to do my rounds.
- Okay, Doc.

1089
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:22,812
Let's go.

1090
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:31,420
Who's the eldest?

1091
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,629
That means you
should apologize.

1092
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,565
Go on.

1093
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,203
Sorry, yeah?

1094
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,539
Sorry.

1095
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,011
Yeah.

1096
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,280
He said, "Yeah."

1097
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:02,785
This is troublesome like this.
You sit here, go on.

1098
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,360
Now ask for forgiveness.

1099
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:16,666
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that about Ayu.

1100
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,569
Who's Ayu?

1101
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:23,172
Ayu is his wife.
My brother's wife.

1102
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,775
- Sister-in-law?
- Yes, my sister-in-law.

1103
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,979
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

1104
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:33,182
If she saw what happened,
I'm sure Ayu would get mad.

1105
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,051
Why would she be mad?

1106
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,486
Maybe he means his
wife wouldn't like it...

1107
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,789
... if he fights with his
younger brother?

1108
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,591
- Doesn't want his feelings hurt?
- Yes.

1109
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:46,162
Congrats.
So are you going to Singapore?

1110
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,231
Yes brother, thank you.

1111
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,132
Why are you going to Singapore?

1112
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:53,102
It's an office thing, mine.

1113
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,438
- With Ayu?
- No, not with Ayu.

1114
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:58,407
My office, Ayu is his wife.
I'm going alone.

1115
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:05,114
Okay then, what's important
is we save the store.

1116
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,251
- What store?
- My father's store.

1117
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:10,786
- Ayu is taking care of it?
- Ayu has nothing to do with it.

1118
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:13,289
- In Singapore?
- No, the store is in Jakarta.

1119
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:17,059
Enough, enough.
Your family issues are so complicated.

1120
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:30,072
- <i>So, how's dad doing?</i> 
- He's okay, in stable condition.

1121
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,974
- You don't have to worry.
- <i>I haven't stopped by. </i>

1122
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,710
- <i>Mrs. Ayu is at the hospital.</i>
- Okay.

1123
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,546
I'm at Mr. Robert's office now. 
I'll talk to you later.

1124
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,015
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1125
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:40,683
<i>Come on honey, let's find her.</i>

1126
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:42,852
- Where is that woman?
- Sorry, one moment.

1127
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:44,487
What are you looking for?
There's nothing here.

1128
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:49,225
Lana, help mommy please okay honey?
Look behind the sofa.

1129
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:51,727
Why is she behind the sofa?
Is she a cockroach?

1130
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:55,898
That woman is just like a cockroach,
honey, I want to step on her.

1131
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:59,268
- Where is that woman?
- Anita?

1132
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,405
I can't stand saying
her name, disgusting!

1133
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:04,540
Anita isn't here,
she's not at the office.

1134
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,376
You're making such a fuss.
You want me to tear apart your office?

1135
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,613
 Bring her out here.
I'll flip your desk over!

1136
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,081
I found it.

1137
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:14,650
- What, honey? Where?
- I found my toy!

1138
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,521
Baby, come here honey.
I can't believe you'd do that to me.

1139
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,223
- Alright, you should go home first.
- Getting rid of us?

1140
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:23,225
I'm not trying to get rid of you.
I have a meeting.

1141
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,527
What's a meeting?

1142
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:27,863
A meeting is like a
gathering, honey.

1143
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,665
What's a gathering?

1144
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:33,135
A gathering is when I get
together with my friends...

1145
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,204
... and we talk about
our problems.

1146
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:39,809
- A talk, so complicated.
- Exactly!

1147
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,411
He likes to make things complicated.
Let's go home, honey.

1148
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,385
Sorry about that.
What's up?

1149
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,222
Your father must want
the down payment, right?

1150
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,526
The payment is being processed.
Relax, it'll be available soon.

1151
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,495
We came here to
cancel the contract.

1152
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,465
- Why do you want to cancel it?
- The point is we want it canceled.

1153
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:06,435
This isn't something you can do.
The store belongs to Mr. Afuk.

1154
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,337
Mr. Afuk has already signed.

1155
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,110
Sorry sir, was there
something urgent you needed?

1156
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:18,814
No, nothing urgent.
I just missed you.

1157
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:25,721
The contract cannot be
canceled on a whim.

1158
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,724
My father is in the
hospital because of this.

1159
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,227
He doesn't want to sell the store,
can't you show some empathy?

1160
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:33,028
Once the payment
has been made...

1161
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:35,064
... I'm sure your father
will recover quickly.

1162
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,569
Excuse me, miss.

1163
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:47,510
Excuse me,
may I ask you something?

1164
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,911
Is it important or not?

1165
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,882
If it's not important,
you should ask me another time.

1166
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,951
I'm trying to take a selfie.
I haven't found the right angle.

1167
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:58,354
Allow me to help,
so you get a good angle.

1168
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,823
I can help, it's okay.
It'll be quick.

1169
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:02,792
Don't you understand the
essence of the selfie?

1170
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:06,429
If someone else takes your picture,
it's no longer a selfie.

1171
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:08,564
That's just a photobox.

1172
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,670
Why don't you use
the front camera?

1173
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,205
The result is different.

1174
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,274
So, what do you want?

1175
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:19,909
I would like to ask...

1176
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,646
... Ms. Anita, Mr. Robert's
assistant, what's her full name?

1177
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:25,414
Anita Sofyan.
Go away.

1178
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,649
Yeah, thanks.

1179
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:29,051
Maybe I should just
play Angry Birds.

1180
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,154
Die you pig!

1181
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:34,957
See I knew it.

1182
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:37,026
Here.

1183
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,761
Look.

1184
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,363
What are you doing looking
at Anita's instagram?

1185
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,898
Read it.

1186
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,400
If you want bigger breasts...

1187
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,036
Read the caption,
not the comments.

1188
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:50,105
Seriously, someone posted an offer?
Doesn't she already, anyway.

1189
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:55,511
My son, my life, my everything.

1190
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,814
One more, look.

1191
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:02,017
My darling Jason, my only man.

1192
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,054
Anita is a single mother?

1193
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,261
See the dress she's wearing?

1194
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:14,697
So different.
This is more prudent.

1195
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:17,766
I'm certain Robert tells her
to wear those clothes...

1196
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:18,934
... she's also treated unpleasantly.

1197
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,136
And she needs the money
to take care of her son...

1198
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,172
... that's why she still
works with Robert.

1199
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,574
Exactly, exactly.

1200
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:38,387
I'm delighted to help work Mr. Robert
over, but whats most important is...

1201
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,123
... we need to help
your father out.

1202
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:43,959
Your father is a very kind person.

1203
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,798
I've already forwarded
the contract to you.

1204
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,934
Please print two copies
and bring them here, okay?

1205
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:53,068
Yes, sir.

1206
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,245
Mr. Robert, you have
a daughter, right?

1207
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:04,580
I have one, yes.

1208
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,284
Would you like it if your daughter
became a victim of harassment?

1209
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,019
Who's brave enough to
harass my daughter?

1210
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,122
- I'd cut off his arm.
- You yourself?

1211
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:16,859
Anita?
You're uncomfortable?

1212
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,629
There isn't a woman who
deserves such actions.

1213
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,965
Karma exists, Robert.

1214
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,734
If you do something terrible...

1215
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,904
... then you will receive
something terrible in return.

1216
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:36,845
What if I get fired?

1217
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,282
About that, don't worry about it.

1218
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:44,053
I've already told you,
everything will be okay.

1219
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,055
Alright, I'm in.

1220
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,991
- Then?
- It'll go down like this.

1221
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:52,795
Tonight I'll get my
father's sleeping pills.

1222
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:57,933
<i>Tomorrow Ms. Anita
will invite Mr. Robert...</i>

1223
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:00,069
<i>... to the cafe that Ayu works at.</i>

1224
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:04,073
- Sorry, who's Ayu?
- My wife.

1225
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:16,652
<i>Then, Ayu will mix the sleeping
pills into Mr. Robert's food.</i>

1226
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,058
All of it?
Yeah, sure why not.

1227
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,120
Delicious.

1228
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:55,357
<i>Once Mr. Robert falls 
asleep, we'll take him.</i>

1229
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,529
From that point we
only have 2 hours...

1230
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,531
... before Mr. Robert
regains consciousness.

1231
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:07,369
The point is I'm suspicious
about Ari's friends.

1232
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,338
Maybe they're getting
drunk again, honey?

1233
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:14,009
Why would anyone be
drunk in the afternoon?

1234
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,483
- Excuse me.
- See?

1235
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,820
- He's drunk in the afternoon.
- No, he's not drunk.

1236
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,722
While there's nobody around.

1237
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:33,829
Okay I'll go this way.

1238
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:37,032
Wait, wait.

1239
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,336
There's someone coming,
watch out.

1240
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,474
- Be careful.
- Sorry, it wasn't on purpose.

1241
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:51,580
- Careful, he'll wake up stupid.
- As if he's smart now.

1242
01:21:19,942 --> 01:21:21,710
- Now what?
- You take off his clothes.

1243
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:25,447
I'll pick out something for
Ms. Anita to wear.

1244
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:27,015
- I have to get him naked?
- Yes.

1245
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,350
- You're with Anita.
- Wait a sec.

1246
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,918
We can't change job descriptions?

1247
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,054
Enough, it's my idea
so we'll do it my way.

1248
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,188
So unfair.

1249
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,958
Will this work?
It's not a problem?

1250
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,594
Yeah, that works.
Go change.

1251
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,395
Let's hurry.

1252
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:53,175
This is enough, right?

1253
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,281
Her clothes have
to be like that?

1254
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:01,784
It has to be believable.
Get on with it.

1255
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:04,253
- What's he doing down there?
- He fell.

1256
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,254
Yeah.

1257
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:11,026
- What now?
- Wait.

1258
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:12,494
Let me get it.

1259
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,367
What is it?

1260
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:21,603
Breasts, I mean nothing.
It's nothing really.

1261
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,772
If it's nothing why did
you press the doorbell?

1262
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,974
This breast, I mean ticket.

1263
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:30,012
Ticket, I mean ticket for parking.
I found it there.

1264
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:34,116
- It's yours right?
- Yes, thanks.

1265
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,517
You're welcome.

1266
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,925
Alright, now Ms. Anita get on the bed.

1267
01:22:42,925 --> 01:22:44,993
Win, move him so it looks
like he's about to...

1268
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:47,663
- How?
- You know.

1269
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,331
How?
Like...

1270
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,600
You know!
As if you haven't done it yet.

1271
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,635
You haven't yet, Win?

1272
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,405
Are you serious?
You're still a virgin?

1273
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:57,773
Do we really have to
talk about this now?

1274
01:22:57,773 --> 01:23:00,108
What do you do with Natalie?
Play Monopoly?

1275
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:02,177
No, sometimes we
play Candy Crush.

1276
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,947
Do we have to talk about this now?
Focus! Focus!

1277
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:07,382
Your career is amazing,
your love life is suffering.

1278
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:08,617
Your life so sad.

1279
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,221
- I'm going home.
- Okay, enough.

1280
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,790
- Are we continuing?
- Yeah, okay, let's go.

1281
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,225
Lets teach this asshole a lesson.

1282
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,828
What did he say then?

1283
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,064
<i>He asked, 
Why didn't you wake me up?</i> 

1284
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:26,034
<i>So I told him, "You looked very 
tired, so I didn't want to wake you."</i>

1285
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:27,169
Good.

1286
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,971
- Alright, until tomorrow then.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1287
01:23:28,971 --> 01:23:30,739
- Thank you for today.
- <i>Bye.</i>

1288
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,207
- Bye.
- Bye.

1289
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,613
But seriously,
Robert's going to be okay?

1290
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:40,415
It's okay, those were just
normal sleeping pills.

1291
01:23:40,983 --> 01:23:42,918
Just the dose was more than normal.

1292
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:47,089
What I'm worried about is
if he has a concussion.

1293
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,893
He can get a concussion
from sleeping pills?

1294
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:53,462
No, but you kept banging
his head into things.

1295
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:57,999
How is he?

1296
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:00,669
He's eating well.

1297
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:04,706
The doctor said he'll be allowed
to go home in two or three days.

1298
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:07,075
- You should rest.
- Thank you.

1299
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,844
Thanks.
Take care.

1300
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:10,679
- Take care.
- Yeah.

1301
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,052
- You want tea?
- Sure.

1302
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:18,453
With sugar?

1303
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,455
- Have you forgotten?
- No sugar.

1304
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,893
It's been awhile you know, since I've
wanted to do something like that.

1305
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,195
You mean, it's been awhile
since you've wanted to drug someone?

1306
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,264
Of course not.

1307
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:32,868
I mean, it's been awhile
that I've wanted to...

1308
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,571
... do something
together with you.

1309
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:43,245
I remember when I was younger,
I still idolized you.

1310
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:50,619
Win, Idolizing me?
What were you thinking?

1311
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:54,957
Thank you.

1312
01:24:56,825 --> 01:25:01,229
Well I guess all boys
admire their older brother.

1313
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,532
It seems everyone's like that.

1314
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:07,769
But I don't deserve to be idolized,
I'm just like this.

1315
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,839
You're amazing.
You have a successful career.

1316
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:12,741
Successful in disappointing our dad.

1317
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,847
Do you know why I really wanted
to take over the store?

1318
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:23,785
Yeah, I'm sorry, if I ended
up being envious of you.

1319
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:27,322
Yeah, it's okay I understand.

1320
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:32,427
No, Win.
You don't.

1321
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:38,066
When the store first opened it was
a difficult time for our father.

1322
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:40,502
At the time you were
still too young.

1323
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,574
He was up to his ears in debt.

1324
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,410
When he was stressed
I would take the brunt of it.

1325
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:51,646
Luckily Mom would
always be understanding...

1326
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,615
... even if everything
was difficult.

1327
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,387
Mom was always kind to me.

1328
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:04,292
I wanted to continue with the store
not because I was envious of you.

1329
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:10,365
But because it's the last memory
of Mom that I can hold onto.

1330
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:19,875
If that's the case why didn't
you just tell our dad that?

1331
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:24,513
Yeah, I didn't want to force him.
We'd end up constantly fighting.

1332
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,984
Let him choose
what's best for him.

1333
01:26:31,053 --> 01:26:34,389
He chose you.
It's okay for me.

1334
01:26:36,425 --> 01:26:37,859
What's important is he's happy.

1335
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:50,472
What is this?

1336
01:26:51,173 --> 01:26:53,975
Win, in your opinion,
if those photos made their...

1337
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:57,546
... way to Mr. Robert's wife,
what would happen?

1338
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:03,819
I would tell my dad, so my
flirtatious husband would be fired.

1339
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:08,256
Fired from from the office,
fired from being my son-in-law.

1340
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:14,896
- You Photoshopped this right?
- Photoshop?

1341
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:19,768
We still have other proof.

1342
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:24,106
This is the receipt from the
hotel, using your credit card.

1343
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:28,877
Those pictures will disappear
from the face of the...

1344
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:31,279
... Earth as long as our dad's
contract is canceled.

1345
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:36,985
This is also Anita's resignation
letter, please sign it.

1346
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:38,920
You...

1347
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:40,889
I...

1348
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:42,591
- But...
- Deal?

1349
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,344
- You won't believe this.
- What?

1350
01:28:02,344 --> 01:28:04,279
Mr. Robert voided the contract.

1351
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,349
My father's store won't be sold.
Its safe.

1352
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,485
Hey, Nat.
Wait.

1353
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,989
My Dad will be happy now.

1354
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,091
Okay.

1355
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:18,460
But?

1356
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:21,997
As long as that store exists...

1357
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:27,302
... your dad will keep hoping
you'll take care of it, right?

1358
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:28,737
Yeah I know.

1359
01:28:28,737 --> 01:28:30,639
Okay then, if you already
know then you have...

1360
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,707
... to focus on what you
need to do in Singapore.

1361
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:35,076
You remember right?
You're about to be...

1362
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,847
Win, hey. Come on, Win!
Win!

1363
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:44,252
This is your future,
this is our future.

1364
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:47,355
What is more important than this?
What?

1365
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,624
- I can't believe this.
- What?

1366
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:50,825
- You!
- Me!?

1367
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,327
Yes, you.
What you just said.

1368
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,963
- Am I wrong?
- You know what?

1369
01:28:54,963 --> 01:28:56,331
What?

1370
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,467
Never mind, never mind.

1371
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,437
- Never mind, Nat.
- Erwin! Erwin.

1372
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:07,108
I'm headed home to
edit first, okay?

1373
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:10,378
- Don't stay up too late.
- Yeah.

1374
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:12,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

1375
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,853
- Mrs. Ayu.
- What's wrong with Erwin?

1376
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,522
How did you know?

1377
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,657
What else could it be?

1378
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:25,327
If you wanted nastar,
all you had to do was call.

1379
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,131
So...

1380
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:33,134
... Erwin is mad.

1381
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:39,808
Because I don't want Erwin to be
bothered by this store business.

1382
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:46,047
Yeah, I want him to
focus on his work.

1383
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:49,050
He said he wanted to
focus on his career.

1384
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:55,190
Then it turns out like this and I
feel like I'm the one who is wrong.

1385
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,931
Everything I do,
I do for him.

1386
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:06,268
For him or for you?

1387
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,940
Nat, you must know the story from
when his mother passed away.

1388
01:30:13,475 --> 01:30:15,143
Yohan, at that time...

1389
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,579
... was a mess.

1390
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:23,451
He did drugs, and he,
well you know the story.

1391
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:31,259
Honestly, his sadness wasn't
because he lost someone he loved or...

1392
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,895
... losing a mother figure, but...

1393
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:37,432
... he felt he couldn't
make his mother proud yet.

1394
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:42,237
Erwin has that
opportunity now, Nat.

1395
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,976
He has the opportunity to
make his father proud.

1396
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:51,579
You love Erwin?

1397
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:56,251
Why do you have to ask?
Of course I love him.

1398
01:30:57,185 --> 01:31:00,789
If that's the case, trust him.

1399
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:07,295
Seeing the person we love
live with regret, that sucks.

1400
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,098
It's sad.

1401
01:31:10,999 --> 01:31:13,301
Nat, you've chosen Erwin.

1402
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:18,073
Now you have to let
him make a choice.

1403
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,319
Dad.

1404
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:33,688
Win.

1405
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:36,358
Go home.

1406
01:31:36,358 --> 01:31:39,494
It's okay, I'll stay here.
It's soft here.

1407
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,734
There's good news, dad.

1408
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:49,137
Mr. Robert voided the contract.

1409
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,749
You won't have to sell your store.

1410
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:09,691
But...

1411
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:16,131
But, I won't go to Singapore, dad.

1412
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:24,439
Win.

1413
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,577
I already heard the conversation
between Yohan and you.

1414
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:54,903
<i>If someday your feet
can't touch the ground</i>

1415
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:02,911
<i>If someday your arms
can't feel my touch</i>

1416
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:11,252
<i>If someday your eyes
can't see my face</i>

1417
01:33:13,021 --> 01:33:17,091
<i>I'll carry you, be
there for you anytime</i>

1418
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:20,628
I can't stay for long.
My dad is alone up there.

1419
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:29,003
<i>Forever is a long time to
keep the words to say to you</i>

1420
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:38,413
I love you.

1421
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,851
Sorry for being egotistic.

1422
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:54,963
I'm sure you know what's best.

1423
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:03,471
Okay.

1424
01:34:05,507 --> 01:34:07,108
Are you really prepared?

1425
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:13,481
Having a husband who
sells groceries?

1426
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:30,131
Yes.

1427
01:34:34,903 --> 01:34:40,108
Are you sure, if I need
help at the store, then...

1428
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,710
... you have to leave
your office job?

1429
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,447
Yes, I'm ready.

1430
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:48,449
Are you sure?

1431
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:52,020
Sure, sure.

1432
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:02,297
My dad told me...

1433
01:35:03,498 --> 01:35:08,369
... that store, okay.
Listen to me first.

1434
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,072
That store...

1435
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:15,209
... will be given to Yohan.

1436
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:23,685
Then he was adamant that
I need to go to Singapore.

1437
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,421
What?

1438
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:33,928
You're so annoying.

1439
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,536
Even though I already
started imagining...

1440
01:35:41,536 --> 01:35:43,871
... you wearing a
one-piece pajama.

1441
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:46,407
- Weighing rice.
- What else?

1442
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:48,776
- Measuring sugar.
- Okay.

1443
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:52,714
Miss, I'd like to buy
some eggs and butter.

1444
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:54,649
You...

1445
01:36:01,889 --> 01:36:05,526
In the end he gave up and
canceled the contract.

1446
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:09,063
But I don't know, Mom.

1447
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,600
What will happen to the store.

1448
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:16,270
If only I could sort
out my life right Mom?

1449
01:36:16,704 --> 01:36:18,406
So Dad would trust me.

1450
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:22,377
So Erwin can focus on his career.

1451
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:25,413
I feel sorry for him, Mom.

1452
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:29,484
I was wrong.

1453
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:31,853
I was wrong.

1454
01:36:55,043 --> 01:36:56,744
Forgive me, Ling.

1455
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,882
I already told you.

1456
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:05,453
If you're not here,
everything would be a mess.

1457
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:11,726
But it's not too late.

1458
01:37:12,794 --> 01:37:15,596
I'll try to fix everything.

1459
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:26,641
Forgive me, Yohan.

1460
01:37:29,944 --> 01:37:31,813
Forgive me.

1461
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:42,190
Forgive me too dad.

1462
01:37:49,831 --> 01:37:53,468
- I'm sorry, Ayu.
- Yes dad.

1463
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,252
- Naryo.
- Yes, ma'am?

1464
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:13,654
Why are all these
containers open?

1465
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:18,426
I've been trying each one,
you said I could test them.

1466
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:21,963
I meant that one container
could be tested, Naryo.

1467
01:38:21,963 --> 01:38:24,699
I thought you meant one
pastry from each container.

1468
01:38:25,133 --> 01:38:28,035
That's what you wanted you.
What?

1469
01:38:28,035 --> 01:38:30,238
Don't act like you know anything
about pastries, bread seller.

1470
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,342
Why not? They're both made from flour
I'm just not selling from my cart now.

1471
01:38:35,777 --> 01:38:38,813
See Ma'am.
All men are the same, all of them.

1472
01:38:38,813 --> 01:38:41,916
Look Ma'am, he's leaving.
That's supposed to be sold!

1473
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,519
- It's cute, I like the design.
- How long did it take to prepare?

1474
01:38:45,553 --> 01:38:47,822
- Congratulations.
- Thank you sir.

1475
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:50,091
Ma'am you're getting even bigger!

1476
01:38:50,558 --> 01:38:52,827
- What is, sir?
- The store, store.

1477
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:57,598
So Anita just finished her
probation period with Ms. Sonya.

1478
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:01,035
- She does a great job.
- Thank you, Ma'am.

1479
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:05,473
Miss Anita's clothes aren't
as revealing anymore, I like it.

1480
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:07,809
- Yeah, not as exciting, right?
- Yeah.

1481
01:39:07,809 --> 01:39:08,876
It's become indoor.

1482
01:39:09,544 --> 01:39:11,078
Covered, indoor.

1483
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,514
Will you be able to maintain
a long distance relationship?

1484
01:39:14,182 --> 01:39:16,250
Yeah, we'll make it work.

1485
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,986
Just pray we'll be married quickly
so I'll be able to join him.

1486
01:39:18,986 --> 01:39:20,454
- Amen.
- Married this, married that.

1487
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:23,691
This engagement ring still
smells of the store.

1488
01:39:23,691 --> 01:39:26,961
Alright, what's important is that
you guys start a family soon.

1489
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:28,596
Remember.

1490
01:39:28,596 --> 01:39:32,733
<i>The treasure that is most
valuable is, come on...</i>

1491
01:39:32,733 --> 01:39:35,303
<i>... family, gem...</i>

1492
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:37,338
You too, you don't know?

1493
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:41,475
When the store closed,
where did you guys work?

1494
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:45,479
I worked at a mini-mart.
Really boring, nothing happens there.

1495
01:39:45,947 --> 01:39:47,715
I just ring up the
goods on the computer.

1496
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:49,317
Customers pick their own goods.

1497
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:52,086
It was like a vacation listening
to the printer printing.

1498
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:58,659
Instead of listening to the printer,
you should listen to your parents.

1499
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:01,495
The problem is my parents
sound like a printer too.

1500
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:07,201
What did you do while
the store was closed?

1501
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:11,639
I stayed at home,
writing a lot of poems.

1502
01:40:11,973 --> 01:40:13,908
Writing poems,
you want to be Rangga?

1503
01:40:13,908 --> 01:40:15,243
Then Tini would be "Cinta?"

1504
01:40:15,243 --> 01:40:18,412
- No, Cinta is better looking.
- No, Karmen is prettier.

1505
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:20,147
- Are you a fan of Karmen?
- Yes.

1506
01:40:20,481 --> 01:40:22,149
- Have you met her before?
- No I haven't.

1507
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:23,784
- I'll pray so you meet her soon.
- Amen.

1508
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:25,286
Then we could take
a photo here.

1509
01:40:25,286 --> 01:40:26,387
Mr. Kuns.

1510
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:31,058
Your poems were amazing.
I melted.

1511
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:33,828
- You really liked them?
- Yes.

1512
01:40:37,732 --> 01:40:39,400
Mr. Kuns, come with me.

1513
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,602
- Where to?
- To my heart.

1514
01:40:45,907 --> 01:40:49,210
- Hi.
- Hi, Ma'am.

1515
01:40:50,177 --> 01:40:51,345
Thanks.

1516
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:54,148
Why thanks?
We didn't do anything.

1517
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:57,118
You guys deserve it.
Well done.

1518
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:00,888
Where's dad?

1519
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:11,265
He'll make it on his own!

1520
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:15,369
This isn't fair.

1521
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:19,240
You can't disrespect the elderly.

1522
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,442
Let's change games.
Play with tarot cards instead.

1523
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:24,879
So fussy.
Write it down, let's go again.

1524
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:27,248
So, now what do you want to do?

1525
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:30,785
I'm going to fish every pond
in the Greater Jakarta area.

1526
01:41:30,785 --> 01:41:33,321
Sir, so troublesome fishing.

1527
01:41:33,321 --> 01:41:35,256
You can buy all the
fish at the market.

1528
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:37,792
You don't understand
the art of fishing.

1529
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:40,161
Mom, are there any
fried breadsticks?

1530
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:44,465
- This isn't your house.
- Your mother isn't here Ming.

1531
01:41:47,068 --> 01:41:49,437
Your mother,
is she pretty?

1532
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:55,676
<i>My darling I love you,
you know that it's true</i>

1533
01:41:55,676 --> 01:42:00,281
<i>I will always be with you,
you know that I'll do</i>

1534
01:42:02,249 --> 01:42:08,456
<i>Honey, I love you (I love you)</i>

1535
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:13,160
<i>I'll always be with you</i>

1536
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,432
You played in "My Stupid Boss" right?

1537
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:22,603
- Forgive me, okay?
- Dad.

1538
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:25,172
Dad, one of mom's friends.

1539
01:42:30,211 --> 01:42:31,512
Dear, dear.

1540
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:33,948
Ask for some time.

1541
01:42:37,084 --> 01:42:38,586
Don't want to ride a taxi, Ma'am?

1542
01:42:38,919 --> 01:42:40,287
You're getting tired aren't you?

1543
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,791
Mom! I lost, Mom!

1544
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:45,459
What are you doing,
calling for me?

1545
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:46,694
My Lord.

1546
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,935
Thanks, sir.
Sir.

1547
01:42:56,737 --> 01:42:59,874
- Anita is a single mother?
- Correct!

1548
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,210
- Here.
- Okay, alright, let's go.

1549
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,513
If father hears about your
love life he'll get worse.

1550
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:09,050
I'll keep him safe.

1551
01:43:09,617 --> 01:43:11,819
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1552
01:43:19,093 --> 01:43:21,162
Don't block my face with that.

1553
01:43:21,162 --> 01:43:27,401
Everyone, thank you for watching
Check the Store Nextdoor.

1554
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:29,837
Be careful on the roads.

1555
01:43:29,837 --> 01:43:31,806
Keep your wallets safe.

1556
01:43:31,806 --> 01:43:34,141
You in the corner, stop kissing.

1557
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:37,545
- C'mon everyone.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1558
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:38,612
The important is...

1559
01:43:38,612 --> 01:43:40,981
<i>... The treasure that
is most valuable is...</i>

1560
01:43:47,955 --> 01:43:50,558
You don't even know your own history.
Naive!

1561
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:53,060
It's over ma'am.
Let's go.
