00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,125
- Hey!
- What's going on?

3
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,125
What happened?

4
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,875
Are you okay?

5
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,375
Come on, I'll help you.

6
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,458
I'm fine.

7
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,875
Let's go to the hospital.

8
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,083
No, I'm fine. Just...

9
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,583
help me inside.

10
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,458
Who did this to you?

11
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,458
Those motherfuckers...

12
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,625
Gil was attacked.

13
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,167
What?

14
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,667
They beat him up.

15
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,708
- Gil, are you okay?
- Yes, I just need to sit down.

16
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,917
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

17
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,917
- Need help?
- No, I can manage.

18
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,375
Come to the kitchen.

19
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,333
Hawla, come to the kitchen.

20
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:32,042
Hawla, stop what you're doing
and come to the kitchen.

21
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,208
- Go see how Gil's doing.
- In a minute.

22
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,708
There's lots to do in the kitchen.

23
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,458
Go help out.

24
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,625
Okay, sit down here.

25
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,083
Shit...

26
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,292
- You're sure you don't want a doctor?
- Yes.

27
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
How awful.

28
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,667
They could've killed you.

29
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,625
Forget it...

30
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,875
It was all planned.

31
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,333
So you would help me.

32
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,958
Come here.

33
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,833
Are you cold?

34
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,458
Not anymore.

35
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,125
Asher,

36
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,708
don't bother,
we're not putting that one up.

37
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,292
What?

38
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,833
I told you, no soldiers on this wall.

39
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,042
Only the Resistance.

40
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,458
Put this up instead.

41
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,333
Don't move.

42
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,792
Finally!

43
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,625
So, how do you like it?

44
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,958
It's weird.

45
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,292
Can you explain to my friend Andre

46
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,208
what's the subject of this exhibition?

47
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,667
It's political art.

48
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,750
We believe it's very important
to raise awareness

49
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:25,542
on political issues through art.

50
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,500
Especially in those days, yes...

51
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,833
Nowadays...

52
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,500
Okay, take care.

53
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,833
What's going on?

54
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,000
- A little problem came up.
- Why isn't it ready?

55
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,792
He'll be here soon and we'll finish.

56
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,375
Honey, if you want to work in America
you have to be professional.

57
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,583
This is not professional.

58
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,208
You're right, it'll be ready soon.

59
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,625
- And where is the artist?
- He'll be here soon.

60
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,125
He's on his way, he'll be here.

61
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,208
- He can't wait to meet you.
- Likewise.

62
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,875
Okay, go finish up.

63
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,625
Make it fast.

64
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,375
Laila is the PR of the gallery

65
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:35,000
and tonight is the opening night.

66
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,458
It's great.

67
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,667
This way.

68
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,542
This is the best place in Haifa
to party.

69
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,833
It's super cool.

70
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,917
- Looks like Ali Baba's cave.
- It is.

71
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,500
Do we have to talk about it now?

72
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,750
I can't judge till I've heard all sides.

73
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,125
It's a matter of principle.

74
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,875
Speaking of principles...

75
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,000
how do you justify your lovers?

76
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,292
As if I've had that many...

77
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,292
Why are you asking?

78
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,333
Asking what?

79
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,667
Are you messing with me?

80
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,375
No question has only one answer.

81
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,708
What does that mean?

82
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,292
It's always the same.

83
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:40,083
People cling to a question
and don't let go.

84
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,083
It sucks.

85
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,542
When you act this way,
it's as if I don't exist.

86
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,667
Is this what your husband does, too?

87
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
Leave him out of it.

88
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,333
I'm also surprised
by how often my mood changes.

89
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,375
That's the only reason I asked.

90
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're impossible.

91
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,833
- Hey.
- Hi.

92
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,917
I was looking for you.

93
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,333
Naama, my sister.

94
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,167
Stepsister.

95
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,458
You don't really have a sister.

96
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,458
Figures you'd show up with a girl.

97
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,583
Laila, wait.

98
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,750
I have stuff to do.

99
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,583
Don't forget,
you have an exhibition tonight.

100
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,958
What's wrong?

101
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,208
Tomer and I no longer have sex.

102
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,167
I can't even remember
the last time.

103
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,542
I'm home with the kids all day.

104
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,458
He barely notices me,
he's always busy.

105
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,167
I'm a slave.

106
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,667
I can't stand what he writes,
and he can't forgive me for this.

107
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,792
Have you talked about it?

108
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,917
No.

109
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,417
I know all couples reach a point

110
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,875
where all that's left is family life,
but...

111
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,250
I don't care if he writes
and this drives him nuts.

112
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,250
A century ago, he would've learned
his father's trade

113
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:21,000
and become a carpenter,
but now he has to be a writer.

114
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,208
If he doesn't know
what he loves about me...

115
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,667
how can we build anything together?

116
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,250
I need a drink.

117
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,208
- Good evening.
- Hello.

118
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,958
- What do you want?
- A quick frisk before going in.

119
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,250
Nonsense! Do you know who I am?

120
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,292
- Of course.
- Really?

121
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,500
I have to frisk you
even if you own half of Haifa.

122
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,375
Just let me frisk you,
then you can go.

123
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,542
Arms up.

124
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,750
Go ahead.

125
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,833
This way, sir.

126
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,333
- Welcome.
- Hello.

127
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,583
Meeting someone?

128
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,417
- My wife.
- Go ahead.

129
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,500
Have you seen my wife?

130
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:56,958
What?

131
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,083
Have you seen my wife?

132
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,583
Who's your wife?
A lady helped me hang the pictures.

133
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,458
- Laila, the gallery owner.
- Laila's your wife?

134
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,625
Yes.

135
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,292
I see. She was here,
but I don't know where she went.

136
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,500
Maybe upstairs.

137
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,875
I don't think she's here.

138
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,750
Laila?

139
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,458
Last night I dreamt
I was climbing Mount Carmel.

140
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,458
I got dizzy and felt really sick.

141
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,875
So I told the person I was with:

142
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:28,333
"Let's not overdo it,
there's room for everyone in the valley".

143
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,250
Maybe you were there with me?

144
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,125
If you were king for a day,

145
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,958
what would you do?

146
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,708
Erase reality.

147
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,083
And how?

148
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,958
Dunno.

149
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,083
I haven't thought about that.

150
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,042
It's not you,

151
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,833
it's me,
I don't think it will work between us.

152
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,292
But I love you.

153
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:01,708
But I think we overrate the present.

154
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:09,042
The fact that we're together now,
for example...

155
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,583
we give it too much importance.

156
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,833
Is that all you have to say?

157
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,375
You wasted your energy on the exhibit.

158
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,958
Where were you?

159
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,625
- I looked everywhere.
- Some last minute issues.

160
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,792
You shouldn't have left me here,

161
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,917
..waiting like a fool.
- Relax.

162
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,167
Did you see the photos?
Go look at them in the gallery.

163
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:56,917
Some are really nice,
I think you'll like them.

164
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,333
Do you hate Israelis?

165
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,542
I don't speak Hebrew.

166
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,375
Do you hate Israelis?

167
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:27,042
Sometimes I wouldn't mind
seeing them all croak,

168
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,250
sometimes not.

169
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,250
I have other things to think about.

170
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,208
They say love and hate are alike.

171
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,083
And wouldn't you?

172
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,667
Wouldn't you hate Israelis
if they kept you in prison,

173
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,583
if they locked you up
and humiliated you?

174
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,167
If they forced you
to see your mother, father,

175
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:54,583
sister, the man you love,
your children, die?

176
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,708
Or go crazy day after day,

177
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,375
year after year,
generation after generation?

178
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,208
I don't think I have the right
to say you're wrong.

179
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,667
Of course not, you're Israeli.

180
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,417
Maybe we have more reasons
to complain than you.

181
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,833
It's no "maybe", of course you do.

182
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,167
Then have some compassion.

183
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,042
You want too much, too much.

184
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,667
Look, the difference between...

185
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:40,333
what happens inside us
and what happens outside,

186
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:44,917
is so big
and the space in between...

187
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,125
we pay a tremendous price for it.

188
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,000
The life we live

189
00:27:55,292 --> 00:28:00,167
is so full of nuances
and it's marked by an endless struggle

190
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:05,333
between good intentions,
good wishes,

191
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,333
and evil thoughts, evil deeds.

192
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:15,500
Imagine if you did
what you said you'd do,

193
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,458
and then you realize...

194
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:24,792
you regret it,
it's not what you meant to do.

195
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:30,083
You'd be super sorry for that.

196
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:36,667
Maybe it would change you,
maybe...

197
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:41,625
it would make you be a different person.

198
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,917
You said that.

199
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,375
Okay...

200
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,750
Have a good night.

201
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,583
You, too.

202
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,000
Do you really think
this gallery makes sense?

203
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,167
Of course.

204
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:24,542
The fact that it exists proves
how much this initiative is needed.

205
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,417
What today is worth devoting
all one's energy to?

206
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:35,292
The time of the great epochs...

207
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,833
has passed.

208
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,875
Religion?

209
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,958
Why not?

210
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,458
And other than religion,

211
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,708
the nation, the State...

212
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,833
science, culture? No, no.

213
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,125
That leaves the arts.

214
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:05,417
But nowadays, it feels like everything
has been done already.

215
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,417
Don't look always to the past.

216
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,333
I agree.

217
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,125
We give too much importance
to too many things.

218
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,750
Bye-bye, my friend.

219
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,375
I have a proposal for you.

220
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,083
I'm going to open a gallery in L.A.

221
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:46,250
I would like to show your work.

222
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:49,750
Doesn't sound like
you have much to gain.

223
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:55,417
It's not a question of money.
The money it'll cost

224
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:59,083
is nothing compared to
what I wish to gain.

225
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,125
To gain from me?

226
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,625
I don't hear that often.

227
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,083
Your personality is what interests me.

228
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:11,250
My personality?

229
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,958
- I have a question for you.
- Go ahead.

230
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,500
What's in it for Laila?

231
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,042
Money?

232
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,583
I heard you want to use her connections
to buy land in Ramallah.

233
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,458
No offense,

234
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,250
but if you and I intend to work together,

235
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,833
we should be honest from the beginning.

236
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,083
Do you always believe rumors?

237
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:43,000
In this country, we have the means
to know everything about everyone.

238
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,042
I know.

239
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:56,208
Indeed, I've spoken some business
to some people.

240
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:01,250
Listen, Laila doesn't know
about your plan.

241
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:06,500
She thinks
that she's your only interest.

242
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:11,625
My only interest is to promote
Palestinian art and culture,

243
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:14,125
and your exhibition

244
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,375
could be very interesting
to the American audience

245
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and sponsors.

246
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,292
Bullshit.

247
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,833
Your only interest
is to promote yourself.

248
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,792
Not a clever thing to say.

249
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,667
I'll think about your proposal.

250
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:32,792
I say, if you're thinking of something
then just do it.

251
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,708
You're weird.

252
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,208
Sometimes,

253
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,583
it feels like my thoughts come out

254
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,875
then return,

255
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,333
as if I was in the bedroom
with the door shut.

256
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,875
There are days

257
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,417
when everything around me is clear,

258
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:11,917
when it's easy to go out of myself
and go somewhere else.

259
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,708
But there are days
when I feel closed in

260
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,375
and everything
becomes sad, suffocating.

261
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,042
What kind of day is today?

262
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,708
Dunno.

263
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,708
I'm not sure.

264
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,500
You should do what you have to do.

265
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,792
Not just talk about it.

266
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,500
You say just let it happen,

267
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:56,125
but it's more dangerous to let it happen
than to make it happen.

268
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,458
Fathi...

269
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,583
I once had a friend...

270
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,875
he was so messed up

271
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,250
and I felt like he...

272
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,000
just wanted someone to touch him.

273
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,000
Not in a sexual way,

274
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:44,250
though that could've happened too,

275
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:47,875
but it seemed like he needed a hug.

276
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,958
And that night, I'll never forget...

277
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,083
He needed someone.

278
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,542
I lay down next to him

279
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,958
and looked at his back,
but didn't touch him.

280
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,667
I couldn't sleep a wink.

281
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:18,417
Then he decided to die.

282
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:29,292
I'm tormented by the thought
that I could've done something,

283
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,958
if I had only hugged him.

284
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:37,000
I was afraid he would misinterpret
the situation, I don't know...

285
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,958
I couldn't save him.

286
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,500
Bon!

287
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,042
It's a full house.

288
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,042
What's wrong?

289
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,667
What are you staring at?

290
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,000
Want a sip?

291
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,417
Too bad.

292
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:28,750
It's all gone.

293
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,750
Now I want it even more.

294
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,917
Funny, the things we want most
are the hardest to obtain.

295
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,250
You know what, Hawla?

296
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,500
I don't know...

297
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:01,250
I don't know what you mean,
but I do know one thing:

298
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,417
you shouldn't make things
so complicated.

299
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,833
Enjoy life a little.

300
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:14,375
Nature, kids...

301
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,708
Kids give us stability.

302
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,083
I disagree.

303
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,542
- Yusef.
- Yes, bro?

304
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,833
Keep an eye on the pan.

305
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:44,375
- Hey!
- How's it going, boss?

306
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:47,458
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

307
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,333
- Good.
- Good.

308
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,333
Hawla, look at me.

309
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,667
What do I look like?

310
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,042
A lawyer?

311
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,500
An artist?

312
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,208
A politician?

313
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,917
You're overdoing it, aren't you?

314
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:09,333
Well?
Maybe a photographer?

315
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:13,167
Why, what does a photographer
look like?

316
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,250
Nobody looks like what they are,
except religious people.

317
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,667
Nothing is stable, everything changes.

318
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:25,042
There are no more answers,

319
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,542
no more feelings.

320
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,958
Just opinions and half-truths.

321
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,292
Know what I mean?

322
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,417
I like it that way.

323
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:37,083
Really?

324
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:40,875
Everything is stuck,
not just you.

325
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,333
No big deal.

326
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:49,375
It just means people don't know
what to think or do.

327
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,583
I think that's a good thing.

328
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,792
I want to go look for <i>hafafish</i>.

329
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,542
- What is <i>hafafish</i>?
- Bats.

330
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,958
Bats? Now?

331
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,875
You never know...

332
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,292
Gimme a kiss.

333
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,042
A little one.

334
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,708
Hey, hey, Fathi, Fathi.
Fathi, what's wrong?

335
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,667
We have to stop seeing each other.

336
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,417
What?

337
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,333
Why?

338
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,542
Because I can't be seen with you.

339
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:25,583
You know I don't give a damn
about what people think.

340
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,000
You know that.

341
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,500
- Don't you get it?
- What?

342
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:34,167
They can't touch you,
they'll take it out on me.

343
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,750
I'd never let anyone hurt you.

344
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,458
- You know that.
- Stop it.

345
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:41,250
They'll come get you first,
then me.

346
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:45,375
Stop it, enough.
Don't think about it.

347
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:48,417
Stop worrying
about what might happen and live.

348
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,667
Want to live in this moment?

349
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,958
Want to kiss me?

350
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,708
Well?

351
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,833
Relax.

352
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,833
Look at her... Josephine.

353
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:17,208
You might not know,
but Josephine thinks she's a saint.

354
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:20,833
But believe me...

355
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,125
she's dying from her sins.

356
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:26,667
Do you think I'm like Josephine?

357
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,417
Meaning the way a sculpture
is like a piece of wood?

358
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,875
Wow.

359
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,083
Nice.

360
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:42,333
You know, at times when I'm invited
to social events,

361
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:48,875
I feel like a person who walks out
before the last scene, you know?

362
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,500
Into a dark space,

363
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,708
leaving behind a hat, a cane,

364
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,542
and a play.

365
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:02,917
Fathi, you'll be leaving me
in a few days.

366
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,625
How will I deal with my issues?

367
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,083
We can be together.

368
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,875
Just... give me your hand.

369
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:16,208
Let's go.

370
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:32,000
Explain to me

371
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:36,000
why you sent an Israeli photographer...
I'm talking to you.

372
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:40,917
An Israeli photographer to America
on behalf of the gallery?

373
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:44,250
What were you thinking?

374
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,500
Use your head.

375
00:46:48,292 --> 00:46:50,625
It could help the gallery.

376
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:56,792
I told you not to meddle in politics
without talking to me first.

377
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:02,292
I will, but you're overreacting.

378
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,000
There's a big difference

379
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:09,667
between promoting the Palestinian cause

380
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,750
and promoting an Israeli photographer.

381
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:18,417
Know how many messages I've gotten
from interested clients?

382
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:22,083
Gil is famous
and Roberta is respected worldwide.

383
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:25,125
Roberta? Her?

384
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,792
You're so shallow.

385
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:40,708
Hani.

386
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,333
Hani?

387
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,583
- Whisky, please.
- Right away.

388
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,125
- Hello, Gil.
- Hello.

389
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,417
- How are you?
- Fine.

390
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,333
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

391
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,667
Cheers.

392
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:10,500
Cheers.

393
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,208
Gil...

394
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:23,625
can you tell me
what my wife sees in Roberta?

395
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,542
Maybe...

396
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,042
she can help her with her career.

397
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,000
I don't know...

398
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,333
Other ideas?

399
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,208
Maybe she has an artistic side.

400
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:53,042
A women like that has an artistic side?

401
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,833
Ever notice how many people
talk to themselves on the street?

402
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:06,292
There's something wrong with them.

403
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,667
Whatever they can't swallow,
they spit out.

404
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,000
With some people, the need to create
works the same way.

405
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:29,500
I think there is something wrong with her.

406
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:37,208
When you're as rich as her,
why not be an artist?

407
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,042
You didn't want to be an artist,
did you?

408
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,667
Not really.

409
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,625
Never.

410
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,417
I just documented
the lives of others.

411
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,417
To you.

412
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,292
To life.

413
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,583
I wanted to tell you something.

414
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:40,417
At one point in life,
everything you do is for someone else.

415
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:44,667
The sun shines only for him,

416
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,917
he's everywhere and you're nowhere.

417
00:50:51,792 --> 00:50:55,250
But yet, you don't do it

418
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:59,292
because you expect that person
to feel exactly the same way.

419
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,208
Until, in end, those two people...

420
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:07,583
almost cease to exist.

421
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,958
They exist, but only for each other

422
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:15,500
and all that remains
is a world for the two of them,

423
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,750
where there's nothing
but mutual encouragement,

424
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:23,458
devotion,

425
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,625
friendship,

426
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,833
and total self-sacrifice.

427
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,292
Fill it up.

428
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:10,958
More?

429
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:12,292
Enough.

430
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,417
- Listen to this song...
- Go ahead.

431
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:19,250
<i>Kiss me, Hani, Hani, kiss me...</i>

432
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:21,583
You and your nonsense!

433
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,583
- I found a bottle...
- Hush.

434
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,250
- Full of water.
- Enough.

435
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:27,333
- Hi.
- Hello.

436
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,792
- Can I get a mixed Martini?
- Sure.

437
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,542
Mixed with what?

438
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,167
Dunno, that's what it's called.

439
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,458
What's it mixed with, Hani?

440
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,292
Lemon, bro.

441
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,875
Lemon.

442
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,375
Not working tomorrow?

443
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:56,083
No, tomorrow is Saturday.

444
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,417
Right.

445
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,208
Silly me.

446
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,000
No, thanks.

447
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:22,208
You don't smoke?

448
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,167
Sometimes when I drink.

449
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:29,958
You drink often?

450
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,917
No, I don't like drinking alone.

451
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,792
- Majd.
- Naama.

452
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:45,167
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

453
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:46,958
Thanks.

454
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:56,125
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

455
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:58,875
- Look me in the eye!
- I did.

456
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,667
Why are you here alone?

457
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,708
I came to see the exhibition.

458
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:20,333
It's my brother's work.

459
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:25,417
First time here?

460
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:32,208
I was born here.

461
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,917
Here?

462
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:37,167
Not right here, but in Haifa.

463
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,208
- In a hospital.
- I figured.

464
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,667
I think you're really sweet.

465
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,000
You're really sweet, too.

466
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:08,958
<i>Laila, where did you go tonight?</i>

467
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:16,542
<i>And the night tells me:
"Give my regards to Laila"</i>

468
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:23,833
<i>Love is not sweet</i>

469
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,708
<i>Unless Laila sings tonight...</i>

470
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:29,750
- You don't understand, do you?
- No.

471
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:32,458
- But it's nice.
- Thanks.

472
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,833
Were you warned about the Arabs
you'd meet in Haifa?

473
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,000
I've never been afraid of Arabs.

474
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:42,542
They're no different from other men.

475
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:06,792
You know what bothers me?

476
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,833
The way my husband looks at me.

477
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,833
Because he loves you.

478
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:25,083
He can't wait
for everything I've done to flop.

479
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:31,208
He's worried about you.

480
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,750
He's not a fan of Roberta.

481
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,708
She only looks out for herself.

482
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,833
Roberta thinks her reputation
can help us both.

483
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:46,333
Of course.

484
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:49,250
She says that because she's rich.

485
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:51,833
All she cares about is fame.

486
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:54,458
Why?

487
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,167
Because she can.

488
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,667
What do you have against her?

489
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:06,917
Nothing.

490
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,625
You seem bitter.

491
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:20,292
You're never happy with anything.

492
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:24,167
Roberta told me
you turned down her offer.

493
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,875
She's a liar.

494
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,458
I didn't say yes or no.

495
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:35,958
All you do is criticize.

496
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:41,250
She could get us both
out of this shithole.

497
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,792
Where were you?

498
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,833
I went for a walk.

499
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,667
Listen, Gil...

500
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:16,833
I don't want to step on my wife's toes,

501
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,750
but between you and me...

502
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:23,083
do you think this is a good idea?

503
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:33,125
When politics falls into the hands
of amateurs

504
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,542
it's very dangerous.

505
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,917
That Roberta is odd, isn't she?

506
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,833
Who does she think she is?

507
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,042
If you loved your homeland...

508
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,417
- Then?
- What?

509
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:58,458
Then what?
If I loved my homeland then what?

510
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,958
I'd find a way.

511
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:10,250
A covert way out
that my wife wouldn't notice.

512
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:23,625
- Nobody takes me seriously here.
- That's not true.

513
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:26,792
Everyone here thinks
you're an excellent photographer.

514
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:36,750
You know what keeps the Middle East going?

515
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:41,417
- More or less.
- People like me.

516
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:46,708
You see what's happening,
do you call that balanced?

517
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,250
I'm leaving.

518
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,292
What do you want?

519
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,625
Kamal Khadr.

520
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:30,792
Mr. Leech?

521
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:35,042
Do I look like a leech to you?

522
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:38,708
You don't look like Mr. Leech.

523
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:49,208
Range Rover.

524
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:54,542
You look like someone
who has it all.

525
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,833
Thanks to my hard work.

526
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:03,125
Can't a man enjoy
what he's worked hard for?

527
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,625
Some work, and some shed blood.

528
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,542
Must be a fancy car.
What did it cost?

529
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:20,458
Don't push your luck,
give me back my keys.

530
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,000
How much did it cost?

531
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:27,208
Kid...

532
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:29,458
Watch out.

533
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,542
How much?

534
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,500
Enough!

535
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,667
Sometimes, I regret my life.

536
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:38,667
That's the only thing you can't do.

537
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:48,250
Unlike you, I haven't done much yet
so I have nothing to regret.

538
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:53,292
You have no idea how that feels.

539
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:56,792
It's an unpleasant situation.

540
01:06:58,292 --> 01:07:00,375
Nobody has the right

541
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:05,500
to deny the burden of life,

542
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,375
to deny the fact
that we're all doomed.

543
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:15,333
If life were short
and mostly empty...

544
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:22,833
You never listen when I try
to tell you something important.

545
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,417
Know how many times I've felt fear...

546
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:33,458
growing inside of me,
when I wasn't paying attention?

547
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,583
Suddenly, I've realized
how different we are.

548
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,833
If something is bothering you

549
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,125
it's not my fault.

550
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,708
What really bothers you are my opinions

551
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:53,625
about the morals of this generation.

552
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,417
You'd probably disappoint me

553
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:04,042
if I asked you to be more ethical.

554
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,000
Let me tell you something...

555
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:16,625
if you asked me

556
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:20,792
for an open relationship,

557
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:25,250
I would disappoint you.

558
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,333
A decision like this

559
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:35,625
requires some preparation.

560
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,000
That's how I see it.

561
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:09,292
You still haven't told me
how much this car costs.

562
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,000
Get out.

563
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:15,000
One million?

564
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,250
50,000?

565
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,208
100,000 at most.

566
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:23,583
What do you want, money?

567
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:27,083
100? 200? 300?
That's all I have on me.

568
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:32,542
Listen, honey,
we're like an insurance agency.

569
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,042
The only difference is,

570
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:37,333
we set fire to the property

571
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,542
of those who aren't smart enough
to buy our insurance.

572
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,625
What do you want?

573
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,958
How much is this car worth?

574
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:47,875
- What?
- How much is it worth?

575
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,792
It's used.

576
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,250
Sure.

577
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,708
It's nothing special.

578
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:59,042
I beg to differ.

579
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:02,500
And...

580
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:06,708
it loses half its value
with every passing year.

581
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:10,167
How long have you had it?

582
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:12,792
Three and a half years.

583
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,083
That's 60,000.

584
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:15,958
What?

585
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:19,708
The carburetor's ruined,
the tires are worn down. Maybe 20,000.

586
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,000
Give me a break.

587
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:23,708
It's a gem.

588
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:25,375
40,000.

589
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:27,583
What?

590
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,708
- Fine, who's it for?
- The Palestinian Resistance.

591
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:38,125
That's too much!

592
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,792
We use the money

593
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:42,875
to buy weapons,

594
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:45,208
to pay the fighters,

595
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:47,083
and if they die,

596
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,875
to help their families,

597
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:51,375
their wives and children.

598
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,875
Fine, I'll write you a check.

599
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:59,417
Want a receipt, too?

600
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:02,167
I really don't have any cash on me.

601
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,250
Okay, I believe you.

602
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:08,583
Who do I make it out to?

603
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,292
To the nightclub.

604
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,375
And watch what you do.

605
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:17,917
Get out now.

606
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,417
How dare you threaten me?

607
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,833
Get out!

608
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:26,667
Now!

609
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:29,542
You got off easy this time.

610
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,583
We need to talk.

611
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:48,958
Did Hisham send you?

612
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:53,125
He's desperate.

613
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,292
He wants a baby but...

614
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,083
I don't.

615
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,875
Then no it is.

616
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:08,292
But it'll kill him.

617
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:11,167
Or me.

618
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,792
You'll be fine.

619
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:16,500
Even when we're old and wrinkly,

620
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:19,708
Hisham's face will be young and fresh.

621
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:23,292
Even if his hair goes white.

622
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:26,375
He thinks he has to protect me.

623
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:32,417
That's why he thinks
I need to get pregnant.

624
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:38,875
He'll say that good mothers
take care of their children,

625
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,917
but he'll raise them with his principles.

626
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:47,125
He wants me to belong only to him.

627
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:51,250
He wants to turn us into
a ridiculous bourgeois couple.

628
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:55,583
I'm his whole world.

629
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:01,833
But I'd rather have your baby.

630
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:10,833
I can't betray a friend.

631
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,500
Am I moving too fast?

632
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:22,833
You're not attracted to me?

633
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,083
You like me, I know it.

634
01:14:30,792 --> 01:14:34,917
I can tell by how you look at me
when you come over.

635
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:39,958
You try to keep your cool
and tell yourself

636
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:42,583
you don't betray friends.

637
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:46,000
But hundreds of times you've thought:

638
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,417
"I'd love to fuck Hawla".

639
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,625
You should've...

640
01:14:56,375 --> 01:15:00,375
You should've used your lying mouth
for more than just talk.

641
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:21,958
Hawla, you don't want to do this.

642
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:25,625
You shouldn't do it.

643
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:42,000
I don't understand you.

644
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:45,417
It's simple.

645
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,042
Fine,

646
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,833
I won't keep you.

647
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:02,875
Don't tell Hisham, okay?

648
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,958
It'll be our secret.

649
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:17,417
Hisham!

650
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,833
What's up?

651
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:25,042
Come here, shithead.

652
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:03,542
What are you doing?

653
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:05,833
Hawla.

654
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
What's gotten into you?

655
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:10,917
Hawla, what are you doing?

656
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,542
What's wrong?

657
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,042
- Calm down, calm down.
- Leave me alone.

658
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,167
You'll regret that.

659
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:31,292
I'm sorry.

660
01:17:34,042 --> 01:17:36,000
Come here...

661
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:37,583
Stay away!

662
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,917
Hawla, calm down.

663
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:43,083
Sorry, sorry...

664
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,208
I didn't mean to.

665
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:58,083
Calm down, come here.
Come here.

666
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,500
It's all right, honey.
I'm sorry.

667
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,167
Trust me,

668
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:20,625
the political system today
is like a bad play,

669
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:24,167
same old characters, same old stories,
same old plots.

670
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:28,292
But if you change the backdrop,
the crowds always clap.

671
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:30,667
Absurd.

672
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:34,333
Disagreeing with him again?

673
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,917
You contradict everything he says.

674
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:39,792
I didn't mean to.

675
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:42,000
You want to have a baby,

676
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:45,542
but in a world like this,
do you have the right to have a child

677
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:48,292
or is it just the animal instinct talking?

678
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,708
- Is something wrong?
- No.

679
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:59,208
Everything and nothing can be said
without saying anything.

680
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:04,042
Just like what you do.

681
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:15,000
When I was 15,

682
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:17,250
my uncle and Salma...

683
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:22,625
- Who is Salma?
- Salma is my friend.

684
01:20:22,792 --> 01:20:26,042
She and my uncle
were crazy about each other.

685
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:28,417
They always met up secretly.

686
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:32,458
She was proud of her actions
but ashamed around me.

687
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,833
Know what I mean?

688
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,417
More or less.

689
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:41,000
- How far did she go?
- She never told me.

690
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:46,083
But my uncle was 15 years older.

691
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:52,792
I doubt she went very far.

692
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:55,125
Maybe not, but...

693
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:59,333
in any case, when my father found out,
he sent her to Europe.

694
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:02,000
You should've seen my uncle.

695
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:03,667
He...

696
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,958
wandered day and night,
doing nothing.

697
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:10,042
He got old, lost his youth.

698
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:13,958
One day, I was in my bed

699
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,125
when the door opened.

700
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:20,083
I knew it was him.

701
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:27,500
He stood by the door

702
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:29,000
and said my name.

703
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:32,542
He had a sweet voice.

704
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:37,125
He made a strange sound...

705
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,333
like a crying baby.

706
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,375
Ever hear a sound like that?

707
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,708
No.

708
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:49,500
He was crying without tears.

709
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:53,958
Then he suddenly leapt onto my bed.

710
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:58,208
He put his head next to mine,
I felt his hand...

711
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:02,458
moving across my body.

712
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:06,958
I...

713
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:10,042
just stayed there and didn't move.

714
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:13,167
I felt helpless.

715
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:17,208
He touched my face with one hand and...

716
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,875
my breasts with the other.

717
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:26,250
He tried to kiss me but I pulled away.

718
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:31,458
He was a much older man,
I was just a kid,

719
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,542
I was strong enough to stop him but...

720
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:37,208
I did nothing.

721
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:39,625
And I hated myself for this.

722
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,667
He stroked my hair
and left without saying a word.

723
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,625
Your opinions have taken root in us...

724
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:14,958
and have imprisoned us for life.

725
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:24,042
You're all liars.

726
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:31,000
You want to see us broken
and play with us like puppets.

727
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,000
If we don't wake up now,

728
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:47,208
it will just be another case...

729
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:49,500
of murder.

730
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:56,167
And the next victim could be me.

731
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,958
Leave us alone for once.

732
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:25,833
If you weren't showing off your body,

733
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,125
nothing would've happened.

734
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:32,333
I bet you provoked him.

735
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:39,792
What are you doing out so late?

736
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,417
Where are your brothers?

737
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:55,792
I don't know what'll become of me.

738
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:00,917
They threaten me, nobody believes me.

739
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,458
I'm ashamed to tell them about me.

740
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:16,333
I have nowhere to go.

741
01:25:17,042 --> 01:25:19,250
I was kicked out of my home.

742
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:28,500
I feel like
they're watching my every move.

743
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,833
I feel like I'm suffocating.

744
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:39,083
I'm afraid no one can help me.

745
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,500
Last night...

746
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:45,833
I dreamt Hawla was climbing
up a ladder.

747
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:50,667
Suddenly...

748
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:02,208
Suddenly, I lost my balance.

749
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:07,625
The ladder slipped from my hands,
I tried to grab it.

750
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:14,500
She fell.

751
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:19,792
She fell on her back
like Christ on the cross.

752
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:28,708
You should take her to a doctor.

753
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,208
She's changed lately.

754
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:34,375
I'm worried.

755
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:39,000
I don't want her to die.

756
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,167
Hisham,

757
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:48,500
she needs someone to take care of her
and listen to her.

758
01:28:39,542 --> 01:28:40,833
Amir?

759
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,125
- No.
- Sorry.

760
01:28:54,792 --> 01:28:56,875
Excuse me... Amir?

761
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:59,000
- No.
- No?

762
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,500
- Gila?
- Yes.

763
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:03,833
- Amir?
- Yes.

764
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,083
Thanks.

765
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:16,250
- How are you?
- Good evening.

766
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,292
- Good evening.
- I'm nervous.

767
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:21,792
I thought you'd be... younger.

768
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:24,167
- Younger?
- Yes.

769
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:27,125
I thought you'd be more Jewish.

770
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:29,708
Sorry.

771
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:31,708
- A drink?
- What?

772
01:29:31,875 --> 01:29:35,500
Sorry, my Hebrew sucks,
can I speak in English?

773
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:37,417
Okay.

774
01:29:38,417 --> 01:29:40,583
What do you do in life?

775
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,667
I'm a widow.

776
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:46,833
I buried my husband, thank God.

777
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,917
No, I mean, I was very sad.
He died a year ago and...

778
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:55,458
- I'm sorry.
- Why? You didn't kill him!

779
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:57,792
It's not your fault.

780
01:29:57,958 --> 01:29:59,708
- A toast!
- Cheers.

781
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:03,125
- <i>Sakha sahkten</i>, as you say.
- Sahkten.

782
01:30:03,792 --> 01:30:05,958
What do you do?

783
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,833
I'm a rapper.

784
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:10,750
- Rap? In Arabic?
- Yeah.

785
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:13,083
Let me hear something.

786
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,833
<i>You're a senior, unlike me</i>

787
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,500
<i>I've always loved rap,
for you it's just a dream...</i>

788
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:21,000
Wow, that's kind of scary!

789
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:23,792
Do you improvise, too?

790
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,375
No.

791
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:29,083
- You know, on the spot.
- I understand.

792
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:32,167
<i>Amir, Amir, Amir</i>

793
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:35,583
<i>Where are you, Amir?</i>

794
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:39,292
<i>I came looking for you, Amir</i>

795
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,625
<i>And couldn't find you, Amir</i>

796
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:44,708
<i>And you surprised me, Amir</i>

797
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:47,458
<i>And I surprised you, Amir</i>

798
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:50,875
<i>- Cheers to us...</i>
- Cheers.

799
01:30:51,042 --> 01:30:53,292
<i>To a fun night</i>

800
01:30:55,167 --> 01:30:57,250
<i>Where are you, Amir?</i>

801
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,792
<i>Where?</i>

802
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:01,958
<i>- Where?</i>
- Right here.

803
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:03,708
<i>Where?</i>
See?

804
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:06,292
<i>Where are you, Amir?</i>
I can sing, too.

805
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:08,167
- Sure.
- Yes.

806
01:31:09,292 --> 01:31:11,583
I leave nearby if you want to come.

807
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,250
- Nearby?
- Yes.

808
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,042
Yes?

809
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:20,083
Okay and...

810
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:24,375
Okay, but first
I need to use the bathroom. Okay?

811
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:26,208
Sure.

812
01:31:27,292 --> 01:31:29,750
I need to powder my nose.

813
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,875
- Okay?
- Okay.

814
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:36,000
- Okay, I'm here.
- I'm here.

815
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:38,000
Bye-bye.

816
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:39,792
