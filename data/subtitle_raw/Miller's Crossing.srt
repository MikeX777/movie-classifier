1
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,835
CASPAR:
I'm talking about friendship.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,357
I'm talking about character.
I'm talking about...

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,918
Hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed to use
the word. I'm talking about ethics.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,398
You know I'm a sporting man.
I like to lay the occasional bet.

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,875
But I ain't that sporting.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,710
When I fix a fight, say I pay
a 3-to-1 favorite to throw a fight...

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,708
...I got the right to expect
that fight to go off at 3-to-1.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,708
But when I bet with this
son of a bitch Bernie Bernbaum...

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,593
...before I know it, the odds even up.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,510
Or, I'm betting on the short money.
The sheeny knows I like sure things...

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,951
...he's selling the information
I fixed the fight.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,119
Out-of-town money pours in.
The odds go straight to hell.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,711
I don't know who he's selling to,
maybe the Los Angeles combine.

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,789
Bernie ain't satisfied with the honest
dollar he can make off the vig...

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,712
...or the business I do on his book.
He is selling tips on how I bet.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,914
So part of the payoff that should ride
on my hip rides on someone else's.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,509
So back we go to these questions:

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,948
Friendship.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,236
Character.

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,237
Ethics.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,439
So it's clear what I'm saying?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,639
As mud.

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,478
It's getting so a businessman can't
expect no return from a fixed fight.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,116
Now if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,437
For a good return,
you gotta bet on chance.

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,633
Then you're back with anarchy.
Right back in the jungle.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,795
That's why ethics is important.
What separates us from the animals...

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,709
...the beasts of burden,
beasts of prey: Ethics.

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,517
Whereas Bernie Bernbaum is a horse
of a different color, ethics-wise.

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,676
As in, he ain't got any.

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,634
- You sure it's Bernie selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,674
- No one else knows about the fix?
- No one without ethics.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,352
LEO: What about the fighters that tank?
- We only pick those we can threaten.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,269
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,268
- I sometimes bet with Mink Larouille.
- It ain't Mink.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,393
LEO: How do you know?
- It ain't Mink. He's Eddie Dane's boy.

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,111
Of course. The Dane
always knows about the fix.

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,276
What the hell does that mean?

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,677
Let it drift.
It means a lot of people know.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,237
I guess you ain't been listening.
Sure, other people know.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,151
That's why we question character to
determine who's chiseling in on my fix.

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,399
And that's how we know it's
Bernie Bernbaum, the shmatte kid.

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,109
Because ethically, he's kind of shaky.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,072
So you wanna kill him.

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,277
For starters.

46
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,432
Sorry, Caspar.
Bernie pays for protection.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,590
Leo, I ain't asking for permission.
I'm telling you as a courtesy.

48
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,753
- It's gonna get done.
- You'll have trouble.

49
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,708
You came to see if I'd kick if you
killed Bernie. There's your answer.

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,151
I pay off to you every month
like a greengrocer...

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,915
...more than the shmatte,
and I'm getting the high-hat!

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,192
LEO: You pay off for protection,
like everyone else.

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,678
Far as I know, the cops
haven't closed your dives...

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,400
...and the D.A. Hasn't touched
any of your rackets.

55
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,912
You haven't bought a license
to kill bookies. I ain't selling any.

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,714
So take your flunky and dangle.

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,869
I'm not some guinea
fresh off the boat you can kick.

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,954
I'm too big now.
I'm sick of taking the strap from you.

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,199
I'm sick of marching in here
to kiss your Irish ass!

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,437
And I'm sick of the high-hat!

61
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,638
You's fancy-pants, all of youse.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,233
Johnny... You're exactly as big
as I let you be and no bigger...

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,836
...and don't forget it. Ever.

64
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,828
That's right, Leo.
You're the big shot around here.

65
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,431
And I'm just some schnook
likes to get slapped around.

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,434
Twist a pig's ear, watch him squeal.

67
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,074
Bad play, Leo.

68
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,511
- You got up the wrong side, huh?
- Same side as always.

69
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,632
That's what I mean.
Still owe Lazarre money?

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,037
- I could put it right for you.
- I don't need it.

71
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,712
You haven't played a winner in weeks.
People'll talk if he breaks your legs.

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,435
- People'll say I had it coming.
- They'll be right.

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,235
Call me a big-hearted slob,
but I'll square it.

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,432
I think I'll do that
this very same night.

75
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,077
Looking at you moping around
takes away my... What do you call it?

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,675
- Joy de veever?
- Joie de vivre.

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,237
- Lf you laugh at me, the hell with you.
- The hell with you.

78
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,794
I'll square myself with Lazarre.
That's why God invented cards.

79
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,640
- There's one thing you can do.
- Name it.

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,994
Think about what protecting Bernie gets
us and what offending Caspar loses us.

81
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,079
- You know I don't like to think.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,397
Well, think about
whether you should start.

83
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,197
TAD:
Wake up, Tommy.

84
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,674
I am awake.

85
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,237
TAD: Your eyes are shut.
- Who you gonna believe?

86
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,275
- How'd I do?
- What do you think?

87
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,638
You are a millionaire.
You gonna remember your friends?

88
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,631
- Where's me hat?
- You bet it, mug.

89
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,038
Good thing the game broke up
before you bet your trousers.

90
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,238
- Who made off with me hat?
- Verna. Verna and Mink.

91
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,830
- Who?
- Mink and Verna.

92
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,750
- Is Thunderclap running tonight?
- Thunderclap?

93
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,470
- Yeah.
- What's she leaving at?

94
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,154
3-to-1, more than likely.

95
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,234
Lay off, Tom. You shouldn't go
deeper in the hole.

96
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,316
Tell Lazarre I want 500 on the nose.

97
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,954
You would have it.

98
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,436
TOM:
I want me hat.

99
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,229
Is that all you came for?

100
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,915
Yeah. I want me hat.

101
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,031
It's mine. I won it.

102
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,437
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Drop dead.

103
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,836
TOM:
I need a drink.

104
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,836
Why didn't you say so?

105
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,636
[KNOCKING]

106
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,352
Hello, Tommy. Sorry about the hour.

107
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,915
I'll live. What's the rumpus?

108
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,031
Can I come in?

109
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,033
Sure.

110
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,829
TOM: Drink?
LEO: I wouldn't mind.

111
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,833
- I tried calling earlier.
- I got home late.

112
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,719
- Well, I'm sorry about the hour.
- Uh-huh.

113
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,119
Not bad.

114
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,632
- Better than the paint we sell.
- That it is. That it is.

115
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,436
- You thought about cutting Bernie loose?
- Can't do it, Tommy.

116
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,839
That's sort of why I'm...

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,595
- Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.
- Uh-huh.

118
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,194
I know you're thinking,
"What's new?"

119
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,757
- But the situation now, I'm worried.
- She can take care of herself.

120
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,633
- Maybe better than you can.
- What does that mean?

121
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,831
Want another one?

122
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,792
LEO:
No.

123
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,991
What does that mean?

124
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,230
- How far has she got her hooks into you?
- That's a hell of a question.

125
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,798
It's a grift. If she didn't need you
to protect her brother from Caspar...

126
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,515
...you think she'd take
slow carriage rides with you?

127
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,872
That's the deal, isn't it? You protect
Bernie till Caspar cools down?

128
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,798
You're a prickly pear.

129
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,788
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing. I don't blame her.

130
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,080
She sees the angle, you, she plays it.
She's a grifter, just like her brother.

131
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,711
From grifter parents and grandparents.
They'll spawn grifter kids.

132
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,469
Stop it. I don't like to hear
my friends run down.

133
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,629
- Friendship has nothing to do with it.
- You'd do anything to help friends.

134
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,798
Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.

135
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,834
You know all the angles.
Christ, better than anybody.

136
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,439
Maybe you're wrong about this.
You don't know what's in her heart.

137
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,436
If she's such an angel, why are you
looking for her at 4:00 a.m.?

138
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,552
- I put a tail on her this afternoon.
- Uh-huh.

139
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,518
I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around.

140
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,429
To keep her out of trouble.
Wasn't to spy.

141
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,036
I was worried. With Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

142
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,117
What did Rug say?

143
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,437
That's just it. Nothing.
He's disappeared.

144
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,712
So you've lost your lady friend
and her tail?

145
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,354
I guess it sounds pretty sorry.

146
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,599
Help me out.
I don't know where to look.

147
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,234
You know Rug's crowd and Verna's.

148
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,591
I'm worried, with the way things are
with Caspar.

149
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,357
You shouldn't be confronting Caspar.
You can't trade body blows with him.

150
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,634
I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

151
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,912
Except you, Tom.

152
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,432
And Verna.

153
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,834
Okay, give me the needle.

154
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,835
I am a sap.

155
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,233
I deserve it.

156
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,229
Thanks for the drink.

157
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,232
Let me know if you hear anything.

158
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,512
Who was that?

159
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,039
Leo.

160
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,476
He's looking for you.

161
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,910
Did you tell him I was here?

162
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,838
No.

163
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,037
Did you put in a good word

It's not that sinister. A strange man

Verna wouldn't panic,
shoot someone for following her.
