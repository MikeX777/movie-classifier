1
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:53,016
- What does this letter mean?
- I hoped you would come earlier.

2
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:57,975
I couldn’t risk missing my flight.
I'm going now.

3
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:01,100
- Bye.
- No, wait.

4
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:03,933
There's no rush.
And you can take a later flight.

5
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,391
Not now. It's late,
and I wrote everything.

6
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,433
Everything? I don't know a thing.

7
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:13,100
You said you'd go live by yourself
when you returned from Africa.

8
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:15,350
It means we have grown up.

9
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:20,183
- You married me to grow up?
- No. I hoped you'd grow up.

10
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,141
The taxi is here. Will you help me?

11
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,350
Come on, please. Get the suitcases.

12
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,058
I don't want you to leave me.

13
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:45,308
I wouldn't want to either,
but it's useless to talk about it.

14
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,350
Let's go. It's late.

15
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:19,058
Your father being sick
was an excuse to get rid of me.

16
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,683
- You know it's not true.
- Oh, sure.

17
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:24,766
You're going to Africa to meet
a father you've never seen.

18
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:28,850
- An old colonial.
- Don't be silly. He's dying.

19
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:31,850
Now have an emblematic death
in the family.

20
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,058
Colonialism is dying.

21
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,641
Yes, just go on.

22
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:43,766
No, Fiorenza. Wait!
I didn't mean to!

23
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,975
Please!

24
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:45,475
- Espresso.
- Right away.

25
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,432
- Mrs. Fiorenza?
- Yes.

26
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:21,350
- Your father sends me.
- How is he feeling?

27
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,391
What do they say? Is there hope?

28
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,766
They hope... that he dies.

29
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:29,057
They just want Italians
to leave, in any way...

30
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:36,015
Put yourself in the Africans' place.

31
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:40,015
If a guest, after three days, stinks.
Imagine us, after 80 years!

32
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:58,683
- Where are we going?
- Massawa, where your father lives.

33
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,850
- Is it far from Asmara?
- 2,500 meters... downwards.

34
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:08,641
If you go on the plateau
and look at the sea,

35
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,725
black girl, a slave among slaves,

36
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:15,266
you'll see that as in a dream...

37
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:59,890
- Are they curing him, at least?
- Yes. They don't give a darn.

38
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,641
In Western Africa they gave
a medal to the malaria mosquito

39
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,058
for the great contribution to
the extermination of the white man.

40
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,266
Not out of resentment.

41
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:13,683
It seems to be
an initiative in defense of Nature.

42
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,266
- Cool, huh?
- I bet you come from Rome.

43
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:28,850
Granddad. We've been here since 1887.

44
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:31,016
Granddad was a "chicken" soldier.

45
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:34,683
It's what the Abyssinians called the
"bersaglieri" because of the feathers.

46
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,850
He was with Colonel De Cristoforis,
the "Cinquecento".

47
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,308
Do you know Piazza dei Cinquecento,
near the station?

48
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:46,140
That one.

49
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:51,140
They were taking supplies to the
outposts, and he met the Abyssinians,

50
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,558
so Granddad stayed.

51
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:57,600
Do you see that hill up there?
It's Dogali.

52
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,391
Balilla!

53
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,433
Balilla! Is your name Balilla?
I have to get up.

54
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:13,350
I don't want my daughter to find me
in bed like an invalid.

55
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,808
- Balilla!
- You can't get up.

56
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:18,141
The doctor says it will hurt you.

57
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,475
Where's Balilla? I never
find him when I need him.

58
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:24,641
He's always going with sluts!
He will end up in a bad way.

59
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,141
- Here's Balilla.
- Where have you been?

60
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,558
- I went to call the doctor.
- I need my pants. Come.

61
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,100
Help me.

62
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,350
- No, wait.
- What do you want?

63
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:41,100
- You can't get up.
- Who will stop me? You?

64
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:44,640
If I hadn't sent you to school,
you would be naked in a hut

65
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,975
being a witch doctor,
not a real one!

66
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,390
- I'm getting up.
- I said no.

67
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:55,100
- You hate me.
- You are very sick and you know it.

68
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:57,308
Nice gratitude!

69
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:00,266
Who brought you water?
Who brought vegetation

70
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:03,683
to this desert of rocks?
They called it "the rocks' conquest".

71
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:07,808
It was true! We should have
massacred all of you.

72
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:10,725
As the Americans did
with the Indians.

73
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,558
See? You hate me, Captain.

74
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,683
When you were little,

75
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:22,183
you used to jump on my lap

76
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,225
and I held you in my arms
as if you were my son.

77
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:29,683
You had a daughter you'd never seen.
You are a bad father for everybody.

78
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,808
Hear that? You gave your son
a great education.

79
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:38,808
Young people are too severe.

80
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:41,140
Young people know nothing
about life.

81
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:47,765
You're laughing? Go away! Away!

82
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,975
All of you, go to hell!

83
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:54,683
Balilla.

84
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,558
Not you. You stay here.

85
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:31,141
Oh, sad and impassioned gypsy,

86
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,100
who make your violin cry
among your fingers,

87
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:39,225
continue playing
like a sweet serenade,

88
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:43,725
while I am pale
and silently listen to this tango.

89
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:47,850
On this perfumed night,

90
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:53,850
I will enchain my heart
to another heart.

91
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:03,141
Play only for me,

92
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,808
oh, gypsy violin.

93
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:15,100
Maybe you too are thinking
of a love down there

94
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:19,516
under a faraway sky.

95
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:25,391
If some secret sorrow

96
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,683
makes your hand tremble,

97
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:34,225
this tango of love

98
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,015
makes my heart tremble.

99
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:42,475
Oh, gypsy violin.

100
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,433
Dad.

101
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:59,100
I wanted to get up, but they
forbid it. They're the bosses now.

102
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:03,641
Don't move.

103
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:07,766
- How are you?
- And you?

104
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,891
- Can't you see? I'm dying.
- And you laugh?

105
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:17,766
No. It's that I look at you,

106
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:21,141
and for a moment I thought
I'd seen your mother again.

107
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:28,141
- We don't have a lot to say.
- We'll have time.

108
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:32,765
I didn't want to abandon a woman
with a baby in her arms,

109
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:37,515
but Africa was still inside of me.
Now they say it was all wrong.

110
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:40,933
But we were 20 years old.

111
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,640
I understand.

112
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,933
After the war, I tried to
get used to living in Italy.

113
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,558
- Just for a short while.
- The time it took for your birth.

114
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:53,183
Right. The worst was over.

115
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:58,850
- Why don't you come back to Italy?
- Me? Among Communists?

116
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,225
You should stay here.

117
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,725
- And do what?
- What do you do in Rome?

118
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:10,641
I don't know... I go out
in the evening, I see people.

119
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15,558
Your mother went out at night too,
but not in Africa.

120
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,891
She never wanted to come here.
She was afraid of snakes.

121
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,933
I've lived in this country
for 37 years

122
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:25,058
and I never saw a snake.

123
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,766
Maybe she didn't love you enough.

124
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:35,933
Does she still live happily
with the engineer?

125
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:41,390
She still lives with the engineer,
but I don't know if she's happy.

126
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,308
- And you?
- Me, what?

127
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,600
Are you happy with your husband?

128
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:55,933
You surely married some roughneck.

129
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:02,100
We are not very lucky
with marriages in the family.

130
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:05,558
- Do you have children?
- No.

131
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,640
Why not? Children are important.

132
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:16,058
We thought that in the beginning
it was better to have fun.

133
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:19,265
But maybe only your husband
has fun.

134
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:22,765
Why do you say this?

135
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:35,225
Those scoundrels! After 20 years
of running the salt mines,

136
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,975
now they want to substitute me
with a Japanese.

137
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,433
These Japanese people
are everywhere.

138
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,183
My dear, you can't even imagine
what Massawa was like in 1936.

139
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:58,516
Each evening there was a party
on some boat.

140
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,933
They received you
with lined up soldiers.

141
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:04,475
All in white starched uniforms!
You can't recognize them anymore.

142
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,183
Sailors are hobos,
all black, wearing blue jeans.

143
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,808
But they say it's better,
we are all the same. As who?

144
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:15,391
But I told them,
"If you send those Japanese,"

145
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,891
"I'll go behind a salt barricade
and receive them with rifle shots."

146
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,641
Captain!

147
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,600
He never leaves me.

148
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:26,808
Captain!

149
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:29,641
He's always chasing me.

150
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,058
- What do you want?
- Why did you go out?

151
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:36,933
Go home. The doctor said
that you must stay in bed.

152
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:41,058
We did the war together
in the 28h Eritrean regiment.

153
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:44,808
We lived together 40 years.

154
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:47,308
We were prisoners in Kenya
together,

155
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:51,558
and together we'll end up
under the red Eritrean soil.

156
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:54,266
- Dad!
- Captain!

157
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,808
- It's nothing.
- Let's have him sit down.

158
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:59,016
Leave me alone.

159
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,683
- I'll do it myself.
- Easy!

160
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:08,016
- Dad, do you feel sick?
- Don't be scared.

161
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:11,975
You're too stubborn.

162
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:15,016
You are not young anymore.
Time has gone by.

163
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,100
Don't listen to him.

164
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,016
He's old.
He's worse than a mother-in-law.

165
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,058
You shouldn't have.
You made a mistake.

166
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,308
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

167
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,558
He has me rest
on grassy pastures.

168
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:49,100
He leads me to calm waters.
He reassures me.

169
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:52,975
He guides me to the right path
for the love of his name.

170
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,600
If I should walk
into an obscure valley,

171
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,516
I wouldn't fear any evil
because you are with me.

172
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:04,016
Your stick and your rod
give me security.

173
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:07,475
In front of me, you prepare a meal
under my enemies' eyes.

174
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:11,683
You sprinkle my head with oil.
My chalice overflows.

175
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:14,183
What do you care?

176
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:18,933
Happiness and grace will be me
companions every day of my life

177
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:22,683
and I'll live in the House of the Lord
for many long years.

178
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,183
Eternal rest grant to him,
Oh Lord.

179
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,558
And may eternal light shine on him.

180
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:31,350
Rest in peace. Amen.

181
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,516
- Hello?
- Love, do you hear me?

182
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,725
- It's me, Orazio.
- Massawa is on line.

183
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:03,600
Darn! I can't hear a word.

184
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,725
Miss, what kind of phones are these!

185
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:10,683
- Speak, sir.
- I can't speak alone like a lunatic.

186
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:14,891
Fiorenza, can you hear me?
You must come back home now.

187
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,308
You know I'm scared at night.
I must turn on all the lights,

188
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:20,391
and I can't sleep.

189
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,766
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I'm not talking to you.

190
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:29,266
Fiorenza, I found out
that everything creaks in this house.

191
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:33,141
There are many strange noises,
footsteps.

192
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,350
And you can hear music...
No, not music.

193
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,600
Fiorenza, I think we had
a misunderstanding.

194
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,558
We must try
starting over again.

195
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:56,100
Come back soon, please.
Will you come back?

196
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,850
Miss, nobody is answering!

197
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:01,058
Are you sure
she wants to talk to you?

198
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:03,183
Yes!

199
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:04,933
No.

200
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,141
As usual, my wife
didn't hear a word.

201
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,766
She might be under the effect
of tranquillizers.

202
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:14,725
If she doesn't get drunk
with sleeping pills, she can't sleep.

203
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,433
You must understand that,
she's having a nervous breakdown.

204
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:21,975
I'm sorry, sir. Have you finished?

205
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:32,766
No. Can you tell me what time
it is now down there?

206
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,725
It's dawn, sir.

207
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:39,308
It must be a wonderful country
if it's daytime at night.

208
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,016
Madam!

209
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:35,266
The car is here
to go to the airport.

210
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:17,391
- What monkey is that?
- A baboon.

211
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:31,808
- Where are they going?
- Down there, in the Savannah.

212
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:25,725
Madam, it's late.
You'll miss your flight.

213
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,183
Where does this lead to?

214
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,225
The Savannah.

215
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:03,225
I'm leaving.
I have a schedule to respect.

216
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:06,516
- Are you Pan American?
- Don't make fun. I'm leaving.

217
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:10,891
That poor woman lost her father.
Maybe she was crying. Wait.

218
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,058
- No.
- Then fuck off.

219
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,558
Wait. Here she is!

220
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:45,808
Here's the plateau.
We'll be in Asmara in a while.

221
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:48,766
If I lose my flight for Italy,
don't worry.

222
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:14,016
- Where do those roads go?
- They just go!

223
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,100
Otherwise what roads would they be?

224
00:28:20,183 --> 00:28:22,350
You don't want
to go back to Italy, do you?

225
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,391
I spent my whole childhood
having paper boats float

226
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,766
on the bidet water.
I used to say,

227
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,516
"This is Dad navigating
towards Africa".

228
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:37,016
- And my mother would hit me.
- A horrible childhood!

229
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:40,933
Many times I travelled clandestinely
on those small boats.

230
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:45,933
But I didn't think about my father.
I thought about monkeys, lions,

231
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,266
the Three Wise Men.
- The Three Wise Men?

232
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,725
Caspar was Abyssinian,
a Negus maybe.

233
00:28:55,475 --> 00:29:00,058
So many times, after Christmas, I went
back to Africa with him on his camel!

234
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:04,516
We always left before
they dismantled the Nativity scenes.

235
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:08,141
From the Nativity to Africa
across imaginary lands.

236
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,308
OK. You want me to detour you.

237
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:22,016
- Yes, please!
- Go on the plateau

238
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:26,058
and turn 180 degrees.
It's like hijacking.

239
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,141
- This will costs you more.
- I know you.

240
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,266
How beautiful! Are they castles?

241
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:11,766
Yes.

242
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:21,100
No. They are rocks.

243
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:23,391
They are castles
of an imaginary kingdom.

244
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,141
Walls of cities that never existed.

245
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,433
See? Does this look like an airport?

246
00:33:56,641 --> 00:34:00,558
Where is the asphalt?
When you come here you don't land.

247
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:03,350
You touch the ground
like a migrating bird.

248
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:08,850
Let's go get the suitcases.

249
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,350
- We'll make out a single bill.
- It's not very big, anyway!

250
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:28,183
- Tell them "Salam".
- Salam!

251
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,058
Don't look at them like that,
or they'll notice it.

252
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,766
- Notice what?
- That their tits are uncovered.

253
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,975
- They don't know?
- They do, but they don't care.

254
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,516
If you make it obvious,
you'll make a bad impression.

255
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,933
- I don't understand.
- You just arrived

256
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:53,141
and you expect to understand?
This is Africa.

257
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:31,683
- What is it?
- I don't know.

258
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:35,933
- Suddenly I felt...
- Me too, but don't worry about it.

259
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:38,808
It's the sunset.
It's always like this in Africa.

260
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:42,600
If someone doesn't shoot himself at
this hour, he may live another day.

261
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,016
It's anguish.

262
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:49,433
It's nothing. Animals feel it too,
because predators come out.

263
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:53,350
It's an insidious time.

264
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,641
And if you felt it, it means
you're somewhat of an animal too.

265
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,850
It's a compliment,
but it's just a moment.

266
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:04,475
I already feel better.
How are you?

267
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:07,683
- Just as before.
- Let's go, then.

268
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:49,016
This is my shop. I sell t-shirts,

269
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:52,391
towels, socks, undershirts,
stuff like that.

270
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,016
I'm the pride and joy
of the local market.

271
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:59,683
- But I never open. I don't care.
- Is your name Getulio?

272
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:05,350
What else to who sells underwear
to Nomads, Lawrence of Arabia?

273
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,308
Must this child be washed
all the time?

274
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:45,516
She'll get some illness.
They wash her too much.

275
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:49,016
- I live here. Do you want to eat?
- No, thanks.

276
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:54,433
Don't be shy!
A soup, a plate of spaghetti...

277
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:57,058
Thank you, but I'm very tired.

278
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:59,016
Nothing, then.

279
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:12,266
- Is it alright?
- Yes. It's cute.

280
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:16,016
But a woman's touch is missing.

281
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:20,225
A woman's touch
was enough once.

282
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:23,475
Just one touch and my heart,
brain and wallet phased out.

283
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:26,891
- It happens.
- Nobody touches anything.

284
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,308
Let's leave everything the way it is.

285
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,725
Come. I'll prepare the room
in a minute.

286
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,766
Sorry about the mess, but...

287
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:43,558
We won't touch anything.
We'll leave everything as it is.

288
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:46,725
- No. We should take a look.
- Where?

289
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:51,308
What are you looking for?

290
00:38:51,516 --> 00:38:54,641
There are no bedbugs,
but there can be a scorpion.

291
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:58,350
Keep this away from the wall.

292
00:38:58,558 --> 00:39:00,683
- Why?
- The "scolopendra"!

293
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,266
It won't hurt you,
but it can scare you.

294
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:09,475
If some snake comes out, don't be
afraid. They aren't poisonous.

295
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,725
Thanks for telling me.

296
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:16,058
They're just disgusting
if they slip under the covers.

297
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,516
- What is it?
- It's a hyena.

298
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,433
Don't worry, it's a sort of dog.

299
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:29,975
- It cries like this?
That's a jackal.

300
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:32,183
It's a sort of hyena.

301
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,683
But it's strange.

302
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:40,016
Strange!

303
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:42,850
What is strange?

304
00:39:43,558 --> 00:39:47,225
Maybe you didn't hear it,
but we also heard a cheetah.

305
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:49,933
Is it a sort of cat?

306
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:54,475
Yes, but when it arrives,
the hyena and the jackal run away.

307
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,891
Dogs run away from cats here?

308
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,391
Yes. It's a matter of proportions.

309
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,516
The dogs you talk about
are like this. While cats...

310
00:40:03,891 --> 00:40:06,058
What is this?

311
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,850
- I don't know.
- But you must know!

312
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:12,725
In Africa, at night,
there are mysterious voices

313
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,933
that maybe are nothing.

314
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:18,225
But imagination exaggerates,
magnifies.

315
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:21,683
- But what is it?
- What is it?

316
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:25,183
Nothing! Or everything.

317
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:28,141
Or vice versa.
One thing that it's totally nothing,

318
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,683
nor is it everything...

319
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:34,183
I don't know if I explained that,
but outside of here...

320
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,725
There's Africa.

321
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:40,641
You had better keep
the door closed.

322
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:44,433
- Lions could come in.
- No. They don't bother you.

323
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:48,475
They are almost domestic.
They attack only if you bother them.

324
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:53,058
- You mind your own business...
- I'll bear that in mind.

325
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:59,683
Mosquitos come in.
Those will really devour you.

326
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,433
Good night.

327
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:13,141
Good night.

328
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:17,183
- And thanks.
- For what?

329
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:21,433
Stay low. Don't make noise.

330
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:26,725
Fortunately Gualtiero didn't
hear you. He's a heavy sleeper.

331
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:28,766
Who is Gualtiero?

332
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:35,266
I knew you were awake.

333
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:39,308
You can't fool me.
I'll catch you.

334
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:43,808
What will you catch?

335
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:03,350
Don't get nervous.

336
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:05,391
What are you doing?

337
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:12,183
Are you scared of the lady?
I'll send her away. Wait.

338
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:17,766
Where are you going?
Wait.

339
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:20,391
Wait!

340
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,475
It's me!
He noticed. He sometimes does.

341
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,475
- Noticed what?
- That I'm human.

342
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,183
The perspiration betrays me.
I perspire a lot, but reptiles don't.

343
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:34,891
- Why? Otherwise...
- He would never have noticed.

344
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,266
Who is it?

345
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:41,766
Don't worry. He looks like a bandit,
but he's the gamekeeper.

346
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:44,558
Don't bother the crocodile,
or he'll eat you.

347
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:51,558
He can't eat me. Gualtiero and I are
related. We are blood relatives.

348
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,308
What are you doing?

349
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:57,016
Before he eats you, I'll kill you.

350
00:45:58,266 --> 00:46:01,475
You can't.
It's against the rules.

351
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:04,016
If you kill me,
it's like killing an animal.

352
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:07,933
I'm tired of hearing you say
this nonsense.

353
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,225
Nonsense? Is it nonsense
that every man has an ancestor

354
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:15,016
that can be an animal,
a plant, a mineral...

355
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:18,433
It was just an example.

356
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:22,683
You think that this is just a rock,

357
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:26,141
that it's not related to anyone,
it's not a blood relative.

358
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,475
- What?
- Yes...

359
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,183
You laugh!

360
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:36,266
How do you explain
that in Rome I have a cousin,

361
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:39,766
but I feel more similar
to Gualtiero than to him?

362
00:46:39,975 --> 00:46:42,391
Not because he's in Rome
and I am in the bush.

363
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,933
- Why, then?
- Because he's an imbecile.

364
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,350
I seem imbecile, but the truth is,
Gualtiero and I have

365
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,266
a magic bond, of fables
that in Africa become true.

366
00:46:55,475 --> 00:46:58,475
It's not the reality you know,
but it's never-the-less real.

367
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:01,516
Even better!
Do you understand that?

368
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:04,016
I don't know.

369
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:07,516
You don't either, huh?

370
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,766
The fact is that we, down here.

371
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:14,725
Men, animals, trees, rivers...

372
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:16,558
Rocks!

373
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,933
- We are all people of the Earth.
- I'm not.

374
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,475
- I am.
- But it's not true.

375
00:47:25,683 --> 00:47:29,058
I know.
But it's beautiful.

376
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:40,808
Who is it?

377
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,850
I had a head
full of curls and fables.

378
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:49,725
I was born here, on the river.

379
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:53,058
As soon as Mom saw me,
she ran away with an English colonel.

380
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:57,433
Dad was always away
and I grew up with crocodiles.

381
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,641
Maybe you, as a woman,
are frightened,

382
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,225
but I spent days with them.

383
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:09,975
Remember when you were little
during the summer afternoons

384
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:12,433
when time never went by?

385
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:16,600
Who stays awake in the world?
Kids and lizards.

386
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,058
Who doesn't know these creatures

387
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:54,391
has an arbitrary idea
of human relationships.

388
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,850
Go that way.
Go around.

389
00:49:55,016 --> 00:49:57,016
Don't make noise.

390
00:50:14,975 --> 00:50:19,058
Tell your dad I'll catch him.
Where does he think he's going?

391
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:28,725
Sorry if I told you these things,
but I never talk to anyone.

392
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:32,391
You'll say, "You don't have
someone, a friend?"

393
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,183
Where can you find one?
Man is son of the moon.

394
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,975
He's all dark inside.
His brain is frozen.

395
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,100
I don't think I completely
understand you.

396
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:43,058
Sure...

397
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,558
Look at that imbecile!

398
00:51:03,766 --> 00:51:07,350
It's flying over me because I'm
a fellow countryman. Italians abroad!

399
00:51:07,558 --> 00:51:10,933
I don't care about being Italian.
I'd like to be a crocodile.

400
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,100
It wasn't even predicted today.

401
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,975
Maybe people are coming.

402
00:51:20,183 --> 00:51:23,558
- Are you waiting for someone?
- I'm not.

403
00:51:28,058 --> 00:51:31,100
But I have a bad premonition.

404
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:50,600
It's ready!

405
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:12,600
I knew it!

406
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:19,475
Who is it?

407
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:26,141
He's a handsome man.

408
00:52:47,308 --> 00:52:51,433
- Good morning.
- You could pave that street.

409
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:53,433
It's not a street.
It's a river bed.

410
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,891
Then put water in it.

411
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,100
It's not the right season.

412
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,475
Come. The sun is deceiving here.

413
00:53:10,975 --> 00:53:13,850
- Why did you come?
- I ask myself that too.

414
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:16,266
- The sun.
- I was in Venice at Mom's.

415
00:53:16,475 --> 00:53:19,225
My flight was cancelled
because it was foggy.

416
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:22,433
I took a train to Rome.
A 7 hour trip.

417
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:25,350
There was a strike at the station.

418
00:53:25,558 --> 00:53:28,475
I couldn't smoke on the taxi.

419
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:30,683
- A useless trip.
- Useless?

420
00:53:30,891 --> 00:53:35,391
- I must talk to you. Alone.
- No. Stay.

421
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,725
I have nothing to say.

422
00:53:43,016 --> 00:53:46,141
Where does he come from?
The pilot told me.

423
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:50,391
Even if he flew over the house
at a low altitude to warn you

424
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,683
so you wouldn't get caught.
- He does it because he's a jackass.

425
00:53:53,891 --> 00:53:56,516
- I'm talking to my wife.
- Is he staying long?

426
00:53:56,725 --> 00:54:01,350
- No, he's leaving.
- I'll stay until we clear things up.

427
00:54:01,558 --> 00:54:05,766
Where would he go? There are
no hotels or restaurants here.

428
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:09,600
The only choice is to stay. Please.

429
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,558
I'd like to sit down a bit, in fact.

430
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:20,391
One thing at a time.

431
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,683
You'll clear things up after you eat.

432
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:28,850
- He'll leave after having eaten.
- I accept because I'm tired.

433
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:33,266
- Let us eat in peace.
- Without washing our hands.

434
00:54:33,475 --> 00:54:35,933
Eat. I made it.

435
00:54:36,141 --> 00:54:39,433
He knows how to make soup.
A real pioneer!

436
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,016
See? This is what he's like.

437
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:58,016
We all make mistakes in life!

438
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:02,183
I took an impossible trip
convinced I'd find you in tears.

439
00:55:03,141 --> 00:55:06,600
- I'm sorry about your father.
- Don't worry.

440
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:11,933
Why are you getting into this?
I'm grieved even if I didn't know him.

441
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:16,558
I'm the only one who knew him.
Believe me, you can forget it.

442
00:55:16,766 --> 00:55:18,975
I wanted to say that...

443
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,725
- What?
- There's a mosquito in the soup.

444
00:55:24,683 --> 00:55:27,266
You think of everything
to be a victim.

445
00:55:27,475 --> 00:55:29,183
There.

446
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,683
- It's gone.
- You worry about mosquitos in Africa?

447
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:37,058
- You don't?
- No.

448
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,350
It's good to know.

449
00:55:43,016 --> 00:55:45,766
I was saying I never expected

450
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:50,558
to find my wife with a man without
a shirt among huts and mosquitos,

451
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:55,308
even if I you don't bother with them.
I don't know why.

452
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:58,766
They bother me.
And the soup is disgusting.

453
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:05,225
Not only because of the mosquitos,
but because he made it. Disgusting!

454
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:12,766
How exaggerated!
You don't need to cry.

455
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:17,350
After having eaten,
my eyes always water.

456
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:19,391
Like crocodiles.

457
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,808
Considering the welcoming,
I'll take the first flight leaving.

458
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,933
Excellent idea.

459
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:33,725
The first flight
leaves tomorrow morning.

460
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:37,058
Tonight you'll sleep
at the end of the hut.

461
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:40,016
What? I'll sleep with him?

462
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,683
If there are no hotels,
I won't sleep in the street.

463
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:48,266
I'm busy tonight.
My bed is vacant.

464
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:50,475
If that doesn't disgust you too.

465
00:56:55,058 --> 00:56:57,350
I don't want to be alone with him.

466
00:56:57,558 --> 00:57:02,933
- Don't you sleep alone with me?
- It's different with you.

467
00:57:05,308 --> 00:57:07,308
Is it an offense or a compliment?

468
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:11,975
Let him sleep here.
I'll come with you tonight.

469
00:57:12,183 --> 00:57:15,766
- Where?
- I don't know. Where are you going?

470
00:57:25,225 --> 00:57:27,558
Is it true that reptiles like music?

471
00:57:27,766 --> 00:57:30,641
No. Gualtiero likes this song.

472
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:34,891
I tried with others, but he comes out
only with this song.

473
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,558
- Why doesn't he come out?
- There's no logic in relationships.

474
00:57:42,766 --> 00:57:44,975
I keep saying, "I'll catch him".

475
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,516
- But what do I catch?
- Listen.

476
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:52,891
Will you do me a favor?
Forget it.

477
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:57,808
- Forget it?
- At least for tonight.

478
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:02,266
- What's with tonight?
- I don't know.

479
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,016
It's the most serene night
of my life.

480
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,558
Tonight? What sort of life
did you lead?

481
00:58:12,891 --> 00:58:14,975
You can't imagine.

482
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,058
Your familiar tone...

483
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,141
Must that lamp stay lit?

484
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:29,766
Yes.

485
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:34,558
As soon as Gualtiero comes out,
he'll be dazed by the light.

486
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:38,183
It's like a paralysis.
He's at my mercy.

487
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:41,266
I could hit him over the head.

488
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:45,516
It doesn't seem like it,
but crocodiles are stupid.

489
00:58:46,975 --> 00:58:48,725
Crocodiles?

490
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:52,225
I don't understand.

491
00:58:56,683 --> 00:59:01,433
- They're singing at the village
- No. Those are poachers.

492
00:59:04,183 --> 00:59:07,183
They say they killed
a crocodile very long...

493
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:12,600
Oh, God! Gualtiero. Hurry!

494
00:59:13,558 --> 00:59:15,600
Where are we going?

495
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,391
- It's not him.
- How do you know?

496
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,933
His eye. He has a lunatic's eye.

497
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:21,808
And he's bigger.
He'll eat you in one bite.

498
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:24,600
You really care about Gualtiero, huh?

499
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:31,266
Jump. The gamekeeper
only comes when he feels like it.

500
01:00:31,475 --> 01:00:34,641
Don't get so excited.
You just killed a lizard.

501
01:01:06,558 --> 01:01:08,433
What are you doing up there?

502
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:12,516
Stop with these idiot things.
Let's go home.

503
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,933
- He's still here.
- I thought he'd left.

504
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:20,183
Come down immediately.

505
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:23,558
You are exaggerating
with this Africa.

506
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:25,850
I'm tired of your whims.

507
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,058
You've been having them
for a lifetime.

508
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:32,100
I haven't eaten in two days.

509
01:01:32,308 --> 01:01:35,058
This climate is bad for me.

510
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:38,683
I hate the sun, the dust
and the prehistory.

511
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:42,933
You know how it will end up.

512
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:46,975
I must always shout with you.

513
01:01:50,891 --> 01:01:52,891
See how easy it is?

514
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:59,516
- Where do you think you're going?
- Orazio.

515
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,516
- You go. I'm staying.
- Here?

516
01:02:02,725 --> 01:02:06,016
- Yes.
- Are you crazy? What's here?

517
01:02:06,225 --> 01:02:09,516
See?
You didn't even look around.

518
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:13,558
You're doing it on purpose.

519
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,016
You know very well
that there's nothing here.

520
01:02:18,225 --> 01:02:21,516
If there's no connection, I'll yell.

521
01:02:21,725 --> 01:02:25,350
Yes. We're far away
from Via Condotti.

522
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:30,266
- Look.
- I should see it?

523
01:02:31,058 --> 01:02:34,350
I didn't sleep last night
in that hut.

524
01:02:34,558 --> 01:02:36,808
Cries, screeches, inhuman voices.

525
01:02:38,016 --> 01:02:42,850
The blacks. They spoke
continuously until dawn.

526
01:02:44,308 --> 01:02:47,558
Then suddenly... silence.

527
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,683
An ambush type silence
like in a mystery book.

528
01:02:51,891 --> 01:02:54,183
It was like that for you every night.

529
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:57,933
It's not true.
I even finished my cigarettes.

530
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:02,683
I looked everywhere,
but naturally he doesn't smoke.

531
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:11,600
Maybe I didn't sleep because
I waited for you to come back.

532
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:16,225
- It happened to me every night.
- Sorry, but I'm going.

533
01:03:18,516 --> 01:03:22,308
Why him?
What sense is a man like him?

534
01:03:22,516 --> 01:03:26,933
- Don't involve me.
- You must tell me who you are

535
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:31,433
and what you do in life, besides
spending nights along a river and...

536
01:03:34,225 --> 01:03:36,641
And the mosquitos!

537
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:39,558
Like the night we'd finished
the Flit.

538
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:41,141
Be quiet.

539
01:03:42,766 --> 01:03:45,683
You don't remember anymore?

540
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:51,308
Come on. Let's go home.

541
01:04:11,058 --> 01:04:12,891
You won.

542
01:04:17,225 --> 01:04:19,183
The lady's suitcases.

543
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:28,391
It's just your impression.
Here in Africa...

544
01:04:30,225 --> 01:04:33,808
- You can find the connection.
- Congratulations.

545
01:04:35,725 --> 01:04:37,433
Please, let's go.

546
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:52,933
- Are you getting in or not?
- I don't know. I'm undecided.

547
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:55,808
I have a schedule to respect.

548
01:04:56,016 --> 01:05:00,391
- I have my dignity.
- Is the plane embarrassing?

549
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,391
What? That's not it.

550
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,641
- Will you wait half an hour?
- You think I'm a taxi?

551
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,266
- I don't know what to do.
- Fuck off.

552
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:23,516
What manners! This dust!

553
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,641
Listen. Excuse me.
I changed my mind.

554
01:05:50,058 --> 01:05:51,850
Stop!

555
01:05:57,891 --> 01:06:00,975
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

556
01:06:01,183 --> 01:06:04,808
I didn't want to offend you. Stop.

557
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:09,016
Don't leave me here, please.

558
01:06:10,683 --> 01:06:12,933
The truth is, my husband is crazy.

559
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:17,558
He's crazy without a reason,
as everybody up there.

560
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,391
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

561
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:25,100
Orazio would wake me up
in the middle of the night saying,

562
01:06:25,308 --> 01:06:29,308
"I'm bored. Let's go out!
I get nervous at home."

563
01:06:29,516 --> 01:06:31,850
In the beginning I went out.

564
01:06:32,058 --> 01:06:35,975
I fell asleep in the car,
standing up, against the walls.

565
01:06:38,058 --> 01:06:39,891
Do you hear me?

566
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:46,600
One night I said,
"You go out, I'm staying in bed."

567
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:48,475
Do you understand?

568
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,391
It was the beginning of the end.

569
01:06:52,516 --> 01:06:56,641
Lately he came home
just to change and shave.

570
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:59,933
He's say,
"What are you doing tonight?"

571
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,600
"Shall we go drink something
somewhere?"

572
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,933
Where is this somewhere?

573
01:07:11,475 --> 01:07:13,100
Listen.

574
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:18,516
- What do you do here during the day?
- Wait for darkness.

575
01:07:18,725 --> 01:07:22,350
- And when it's dark?
- You wait for it to be day.

576
01:07:22,558 --> 01:07:28,766
Want some advice? Find a goal in life.
It's necessary in Africa too.

577
01:07:55,725 --> 01:07:57,308
A hotel.

578
01:07:59,058 --> 01:08:01,058
Incredible. It really exists.

579
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:08,891
He's right.
It's as if it didn't exist.

580
01:08:16,016 --> 01:08:18,933
Young man, wake up.

581
01:08:20,516 --> 01:08:24,891
I can see that she doesn't sleep
at night and talk too much.

582
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:36,641
Excuse me. I normally am
very nervous. Imagine today!

583
01:08:37,725 --> 01:08:40,350
You all seem crazy here.
Including the pilots.

584
01:08:41,308 --> 01:08:45,266
I don't know if it's the effect of the
place, or the people who come here

585
01:08:45,475 --> 01:08:48,475
have brains that... Not me.

586
01:08:48,683 --> 01:08:51,100
I don't like Africa at all.

587
01:08:52,766 --> 01:08:55,600
My wife likes all this stuff,

588
01:08:55,808 --> 01:08:58,850
and she even likes a man
I don't approve of.

589
01:08:59,058 --> 01:09:02,058
If I did, it would be a liberation.

590
01:09:02,266 --> 01:09:04,975
I'm perfectly well off by myself.

591
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:22,308
Sir, your raincoat!

592
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:48,641
Excuse me, miss.
Do you speak Italian?

593
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:57,558
We could have a drink together.
Let's sit at the cafe.

594
01:11:18,891 --> 01:11:21,516
Do you come out of a fairy-tale book?

595
01:11:21,725 --> 01:11:24,391
Are you the daughter of the king
of the river or the Savannah?

596
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,933
Dear and beautiful African girl,

597
01:11:27,141 --> 01:11:29,683
Italy remains in Africa
and you remain in my heart.

598
01:11:29,891 --> 01:11:32,266
What am I saying?
Am I crazy?

599
01:11:32,475 --> 01:11:35,766
You could appear on coffee bags
with a cup in your hand

600
01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:39,600
in the ad of a coffee shop.
This is horrible too.

601
01:11:39,808 --> 01:11:41,558
Oh, God!

602
01:11:41,766 --> 01:11:45,225
Maybe I know who you are.
You are the fertile half-moon.

603
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:50,850
You are Antinea, queen of Atlantis,
the lost continent. Stop.

604
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,725
I can't take it anymore.

605
01:11:56,141 --> 01:11:57,683
What are you doing?

606
01:12:05,516 --> 01:12:08,808
No, please. Don't go away.

607
01:12:09,016 --> 01:12:11,016
Just tell me who you are.

608
01:12:13,475 --> 01:12:16,683
Are you the mysterious flame
of queen Loana?

609
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:18,891
The eternal woman?

610
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:24,766
Where are you going?

611
01:12:26,266 --> 01:12:28,975
Don't take her away.
Tell me who she is.

612
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:41,558
She disappeared in the Sahara nights,
slowly,

613
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:44,058
in the garden of oblivion.

614
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:07,433
- See? He's provoking me.
- Don't look at him. Be nonchalant.

615
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:19,100
I stop, and he stops.

616
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:22,808
It's useless that you look at me
like that. I'll catch you!

617
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:32,183
- Answer when I speak!
- Are you crazy?

618
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:35,600
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

619
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,391
Wait.

620
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,308
Wait. I'll show you.

621
01:13:43,308 --> 01:13:45,391
Are you going under water?

622
01:13:46,808 --> 01:13:50,600
- It's easy for you amphibians.
- Leave him alone.

623
01:13:50,808 --> 01:13:54,891
- What are you doing?
- I had to tell him something.

624
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:57,641
The last.

625
01:14:21,225 --> 01:14:22,766
This way.

626
01:15:05,766 --> 01:15:08,475
- Is he still here?
- No. He left.

627
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,100
What are you doing tonight?

628
01:15:29,308 --> 01:15:31,308
I'll wait for it to be day.

629
01:15:43,558 --> 01:15:46,391
- How are you, madam?
- Fine, and you?

630
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,766
- Will you eat with us, madam?
- No, thanks. They're waiting for me.

631
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:53,100
First you eat and then you go.

632
01:15:57,308 --> 01:16:02,100
- What is he doing?
- He comes here every night to eat.

633
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:08,016
When at dawn the baboons
return to the Savannah, he stays.

634
01:16:08,975 --> 01:16:11,183
He's scared of the forest.

635
01:16:18,683 --> 01:16:23,891
He doesn't like being with monkeys.
He likes being with men.

636
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:27,641
He looks at men work, talk.

637
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:30,600
Maybe he wants to learn.

638
01:16:32,266 --> 01:16:36,016
Who knows! Or maybe he's crazy.

639
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:41,891
He thinks he's a man
and doesn't know he's a monkey.

640
01:18:00,183 --> 01:18:04,391
They are passionate kisses, love...

641
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:02,725
She liked me immediately.

642
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:22,475
- He's with the long haired woman?
- Madam is here.

643
01:21:22,683 --> 01:21:24,850
The husband is always better.

644
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:33,100
- What is it?
- Sorry. I was looking for Fiorenza.

645
01:22:33,308 --> 01:22:35,350
You look for women
in other people's beds?

646
01:22:37,558 --> 01:22:41,725
- I always found mine.
- I feel sorry for you.

647
01:22:46,308 --> 01:22:48,558
Weren't you supposed to...

648
01:22:49,433 --> 01:22:53,225
- Yes, but I met an angel.
- This woman.

649
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:57,850
No. I met this one at the cafe.

650
01:22:58,058 --> 01:23:01,766
The angel flew away with a camel.

651
01:23:03,016 --> 01:23:06,725
Sure!
Excuse me for disturbing you.

652
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,100
No, wait.

653
01:23:10,308 --> 01:23:14,183
I wouldn't want you to think... It's
just company. Don't misunderstand

654
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,516
I'm happy for you.
I was looking for Fiorenza.

655
01:23:19,683 --> 01:23:23,683
You're telling me? I came from Italy
for her. Let's talk about it.

656
01:23:23,891 --> 01:23:25,891
About what?

657
01:23:26,558 --> 01:23:28,808
No. Excuse me.

658
01:23:29,016 --> 01:23:33,475
One can't be alone with his problems
that they rummage in your bed.

659
01:23:33,683 --> 01:23:39,600
Are we crazy? I know these men
who try to be moralists.

660
01:23:39,808 --> 01:23:44,141
He was looking for Fiorenza.
It's what I came to do.

661
01:23:47,725 --> 01:23:53,141
Sorry. I must talk to that man.
Wait for me, I'll be back.

662
01:24:00,266 --> 01:24:02,516
Listen. Don't make me run.

663
01:24:02,725 --> 01:24:05,766
I wanted to tell you not to worry.
She'll come back.

664
01:24:05,975 --> 01:24:08,516
Don't worry.
They always come back unfortunately.

665
01:24:08,725 --> 01:24:11,933
What did you understand?
I just want to be hospitable.

666
01:24:12,141 --> 01:24:16,516
She'll get lost. You must know
how to get around in Africa.

667
01:24:16,725 --> 01:24:20,641
Where will she go?
When it's dark here...

668
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,225
It's very dark.

669
01:24:33,891 --> 01:24:35,891
- What?
- I didn't speak.

670
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,100
The muezzin!

671
01:24:38,766 --> 01:24:43,266
You want to get into
other people's business?

672
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:53,016
- He says God is great.
- Brilliant intuition!

673
01:24:58,975 --> 01:25:02,766
He says life passes.
Everything turns to dust.

674
01:25:02,975 --> 01:25:04,933
You're trying to intimidate me?

675
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:08,141
- I'm saying...
- Stop! I hate these topics.

676
01:25:17,475 --> 01:25:21,766
Tell me something.
What do these blacks think?

677
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:28,641
- Are we engaged?
- No. I must hang on to someone.

678
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:31,933
- It's an illness.
- Must you hang on to me?

679
01:25:32,141 --> 01:25:36,308
If you'd stayed in bed,
you'd have recovered. I know her.

680
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,391
You're the type of man
I always hated.

681
01:25:42,891 --> 01:25:45,766
You don't have to do anything
for women to like you.

682
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:49,516
You can go around dirty,
without washing.

683
01:25:51,016 --> 01:25:53,141
Stinking.

684
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:56,350
Women will find
evocative odors on you,

685
01:25:56,558 --> 01:25:59,016
reminding them of a lost childhood.

686
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:07,391
If it wasn't so, I would like you.
But no.

687
01:26:13,683 --> 01:26:18,725
Women! They always divide us
and put us one against the other.

688
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:22,766
If Fiorenza is missing,
we'll have to call the police.

689
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:26,683
She might have found out you stayed
and she disappeared.

690
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:30,308
- I think it's the only reason.
- Believe me.

691
01:26:30,516 --> 01:26:34,766
If I were you, I wouldn't worry.
Women are strange.

692
01:26:34,975 --> 01:26:37,475
Women again!

693
01:26:37,683 --> 01:26:41,850
I liked being on my own.
I had to meet these lunatics!

694
01:26:42,058 --> 01:26:46,141
Her and the father,
little paper boats, Three Wise Men.

695
01:26:47,933 --> 01:26:51,266
- He has to hang on to someone.
- Me?

696
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:56,266
Is it a punishment?
Will you just leave me alone?

697
01:26:58,058 --> 01:26:59,558
I have things to do.

698
01:27:00,808 --> 01:27:03,350
- I know what you have to do.
- Meaning?

699
01:27:03,558 --> 01:27:08,016
I got information.
You chase a crocodile.

700
01:27:08,225 --> 01:27:10,016
How disgusting!

701
01:27:13,516 --> 01:27:15,433
Gualtiero is not disgusting.

702
01:27:16,183 --> 01:27:18,600
- Who is Gualtiero?
- He's not disgusting.

703
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,975
Keep your hands off of me.

704
01:27:25,058 --> 01:27:26,683
Understand?

705
01:27:32,433 --> 01:27:34,975
Not in the face, jerk!

706
01:27:37,225 --> 01:27:40,058
No, don't tickle me.

707
01:27:40,266 --> 01:27:44,850
I'll go crazy. Please.

708
01:28:04,058 --> 01:28:07,391
- Look at what a man!
- Crocodile man!

709
01:28:08,141 --> 01:28:12,016
- I'll kill you.
- Don't think I'm having fun.

710
01:28:12,225 --> 01:28:15,016
- It's a nervous twitch.
- Yeah, sure...

711
01:28:15,225 --> 01:28:19,933
- What should I say?
- Always this dust.

712
01:28:20,933 --> 01:28:23,058
What do they want?

713
01:28:24,016 --> 01:28:26,308
This is crazy!

714
01:28:26,516 --> 01:28:29,350
Stop. Are you crazy?

715
01:28:29,558 --> 01:28:31,600
Don't touch me.

716
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,475
How did you get here?

717
01:29:30,725 --> 01:29:32,683
You scared me.

718
01:29:32,891 --> 01:29:35,391
You went too far away.
It's not safe.

719
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,600
I lost myself following a baboon.
It was night, so I slept there.

720
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,641
- I've never slept so well in my life.
- Of course.

721
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:53,308
- We come from here.
- We, who?

722
01:29:54,225 --> 01:29:57,391
We used to live in the forest,
on trees

723
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,516
with our cousins,
chimpanzees, gibbons.

724
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:07,516
Then we went out of the forest
and we came to the Savannah.

725
01:30:07,725 --> 01:30:11,141
- Why did we get off trees?
- I don't know.

726
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:14,641
The forest was peaceful, safe.

727
01:30:15,266 --> 01:30:18,641
The Savannah was the unknown,
it was danger.

728
01:30:20,891 --> 01:30:24,058
Maybe that is what attracted men.

729
01:30:24,308 --> 01:30:26,225
The danger.

730
01:30:28,683 --> 01:30:32,516
We weren't men yet
when we left the forest.

731
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:36,933
Here, we learned to use our hands
and to walk erect.

732
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:39,391
- In the Savannah?
- Yes.

733
01:30:39,891 --> 01:30:41,975
We became men here.

734
01:30:42,183 --> 01:30:44,308
This was man's first home.

735
01:30:58,975 --> 01:31:01,891
That is why I felt at home.

736
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,016
- Like returning to a familiar place.
- Maybe.

737
01:31:05,225 --> 01:31:08,516
Getulio is right.
We are all people of the Earth.

738
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,433
No. There was just one animal
in the Savannah like us, the baboon.

739
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:19,058
Then man became man
and the baboon remained an animal.

740
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,266
Since then, man is alone.

741
01:31:46,766 --> 01:31:48,766
Look. Baboons.

742
01:31:49,641 --> 01:31:52,808
- Where?
- Down there. Near the forest.

743
01:31:53,016 --> 01:31:57,891
During the day they stay in the
Savannah. Then they leave at night.

744
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,266
Why do they go back to the forest?

745
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:05,100
Maybe because they know that if
they stay here, they'll become men.

746
01:32:17,891 --> 01:32:20,975
This is why every night at sunset
they go back on trees.

747
01:32:21,183 --> 01:32:23,475
To be able to remain monkeys.

748
01:32:23,683 --> 01:32:27,100
When I think about it,
I feel a great pity.

749
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,266
For us or for the monkeys?

750
01:33:14,808 --> 01:33:17,100
Are you going out tonight too?

751
01:33:18,891 --> 01:33:22,725
I wonder why I only meet men
who always go out at night.

752
01:33:27,933 --> 01:33:31,975
- He didn't leave.
- I know. I saw him.

753
01:33:33,725 --> 01:33:36,433
He goes around the town
like a madman, but I...

754
01:33:48,183 --> 01:33:49,850
I found something out today.

755
01:33:52,808 --> 01:33:57,600
It's not to get away from him or to
see my father that I ended up here.

756
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:03,850
Nor for spirit of adventure
or distraction.

757
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:10,516
You know what brought me to Africa?

758
01:34:12,558 --> 01:34:13,850
Nostalgia.

759
01:34:19,141 --> 01:34:21,266
Didn't we have a date last night?

760
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:26,766
- I'm not busy anymore at night.
- Sure.

761
01:34:26,975 --> 01:34:31,391
I knew someone else who
never had commitments... with me.

762
01:34:33,683 --> 01:34:36,308
I don't care about you,
about Africa and Gualtiero!

763
01:34:36,516 --> 01:34:39,766
- Not even Gualtiero.
- Not Gualtiero!

764
01:34:39,975 --> 01:34:43,100
She comes and explains everything!

765
01:34:45,975 --> 01:34:49,266
I've had an offer for years
from some Germans.

766
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,933
They want him for a zoo.
You know what I'm doing tonight?

767
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:56,641
I'll get him, sell him,
go to Paris and go with sluts.

768
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:03,725
Are you laughing?
You don't think I'll do it?

769
01:35:03,933 --> 01:35:06,350
What am I doing here,
alone like a hyena?

770
01:35:06,558 --> 01:35:09,350
Who am I out here
in the middle of Africa?

771
01:35:09,558 --> 01:35:12,141
They sent Granddad,
Dad remained,

772
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:15,016
and I chase Gualtiero?
- Yes.

773
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:18,933
I just saw trees in life,
rivers and animals.

774
01:35:19,183 --> 01:35:23,850
- People of the Earth.
- I never met anyone.

775
01:35:24,058 --> 01:35:26,058
Who am I, Captain Nemo?

776
01:35:27,683 --> 01:35:31,891
When it's dark here,
it's really dark.

777
01:35:33,225 --> 01:35:35,058
While in Paris...

778
01:35:36,391 --> 01:35:38,141
Can you imagine?

779
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:40,808
Paris is all lit up.

780
01:35:41,016 --> 01:35:45,891
The traffic lights, ads on buildings,
windows, movie theaters,

781
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,475
cafes,
everybody drinking and smoking.

782
01:35:49,683 --> 01:35:55,141
Nightclubs full of excited
and horny women.

783
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:58,975
I'll close myself in the Moulin Rouge
and die there.

784
01:36:00,475 --> 01:36:02,058
It's not fair.

785
01:37:38,141 --> 01:37:42,975
You're not looking at me? Are you
upset? I could've come earlier.

786
01:37:44,891 --> 01:37:47,100
I know!

787
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:51,016
I don't give a darn about her.

788
01:37:51,225 --> 01:37:53,641
I'm an animal.

789
01:38:01,183 --> 01:38:04,141
I'll catch you.
You won't get away.

790
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,016
You're not running off?
Does the light bother you?

791
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:44,600
Gualtiero, it's me.

792
01:40:12,016 --> 01:40:16,766
I told him not to bother
the crocodile. He ate him.

793
01:40:20,141 --> 01:40:22,141
He wanted to go to Paris.

794
01:40:25,433 --> 01:40:27,725
I should've killed him.

795
01:40:34,058 --> 01:40:37,891
It was awesome.
Fortunately I didn't see anything.

796
01:40:38,558 --> 01:40:40,891
All these people were running.

797
01:41:17,891 --> 01:41:20,266
Good thing I waited.

798
01:41:20,475 --> 01:41:25,141
Let's go back together.
What it is? Fiorenza.

799
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:29,600
Wait. Talk to me.

800
01:41:34,725 --> 01:41:36,725
The sandals?

801
01:41:38,975 --> 01:41:42,808
What are you doing?
You want to leave again?

802
01:41:43,016 --> 01:41:45,766
You know I'm afraid the water.

803
01:42:13,183 --> 01:42:15,016
Come back.

804
01:42:16,725 --> 01:42:20,516
- Where is she going?
- Down there. In the Savannah.

805
01:43:00,808 --> 01:43:05,391
I can't fly over the Savannah forever.
The autonomy is finishing.

806
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,683
My wife's lover died.
Don't you realize it?

807
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:12,100
And you talk to me
about autonomy? It's absurd.

808
01:43:12,808 --> 01:43:16,350
We can't fly after sunset.
Want to end up against a mountain?

809
01:43:25,266 --> 01:43:29,641
It could be an idea.
Dying here.

810
01:43:29,891 --> 01:43:33,266
- Yes, but not with me.
- You just worry about piloting.
