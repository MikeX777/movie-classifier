1
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,260
After circulation for a while,

2
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:34,163
a brand new note will be too used.

3
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:40,263
A $1,000 note
generally has a longer life.

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,773
It can averagely circulate for 18 months.

5
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,813
A $100 note may last for 12 months only.

6
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,210
Damn you stay off my foot.

7
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,454
$10 only, come on.

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,857
A $10 note has a still shorter life.

9
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,550
It normality circulates
for about 8 months only.

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,998
But he's really gone too far!

11
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,940
The old bank-note are shredded daily

12
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,215
through a special machine,

13
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,845
and then sent to an incinerator.

14
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,857
Where they are burnt out in a pyre.

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,462
Take it.

16
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,696
No wonder mammy said money has no value.

17
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,800
Then what happens?

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,465
I can talk, I can't listen.

19
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,443
They're burnt out in a garbage station.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,509
How often do they burn it?

21
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,946
No! Every week.

22
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,984
- Sometimes even daily.
- Right...

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,283
Now let's show you the burning process.

24
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,584
It's like burning garbage.

25
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,333
Come on!

26
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,835
Let's see the boss on TV.

27
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,268
Call me when I am on.

28
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,374
Okay, back to your work.

29
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,974
The plug doesn't work.

30
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,344
Let's me... Let me.

31
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,034
Replace the two wires.

32
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,529
It's playing...

33
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,336
- You're on...
- Really?

34
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,242
Come here... beautiful...

35
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,542
Boss, you're on TV.

36
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,793
Boss something wrong!

37
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,295
How come?

38
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,561
It's machine trouble.

39
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,295
I know! I'm fixing it!

40
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,702
Quiet! The boss is fixing it!

41
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,432
It's going to be alright.

42
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,637
The machine's out of order.

43
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,278
What about these bank-notes?

44
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,890
Put them aside!

45
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,796
$30 million!

46
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,791
Boss!

47
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,162
Fatty, you're late.

48
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,464
We're just leaving.

49
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,805
It's no 1 o'clock yet.

50
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,707
We work to rule, today's Saturday.

51
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:04,606
We stop the machine at 11:45.

52
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,347
Then we get ready to go at one.

53
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,954
What about the unburnt bank-notes?

54
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,985
They're locked up for next Monday.

55
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,681
Boss Monday is Public Holiday.

56
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,951
Next Tuesday then.

57
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,653
Mr. Thomson, it's for you.

58
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,740
"Opposition to overtime work"

59
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,756
Time's up Fatty, it's too bad.

60
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,195
Come again next Tuesday.

61
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,697
We work to rule.

62
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,026
Why are you moping there?

63
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,189
Are you all right?

64
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,699
I'm feeling
a bit proud of my achievement.

65
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,530
I started with nothing.

66
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,069
But when there's a break,

67
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,639
I may get avoid getting rich

68
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,674
and have a chauffeured
limousine standing by...

69
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,107
It's a bit large, but better than none.

70
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,370
Want to get emigrated?

71
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,207
You won't stand a chance.

72
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,077
We all love Hong Kong Bye-bye.

73
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,084
Maniac, a Hong Kong special.

74
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:28,917
Sorry.

75
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,519
- What's the matter? Pick it up.
- OK.

76
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,692
Sorry.

77
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,265
- Sorry!
- Mark...

78
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,336
Mark, there's money waiting for us!

79
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,638
I'm busy.

80
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,480
A big $30 million deal.
We're going to be rich.

81
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,175
$30 million?

82
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,785
Get back to work.

83
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,763
Go and bring Tomboy.

84
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,525
Her daddy's tough. You go yourself.

85
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,498
- Get going.
- Why me?

86
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:14,129
Guess the figure in my mind From 1 to 10.

87
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,774
Three.

88
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,569
It's seven. Go in!

89
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,372
I should have guessed it!

90
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,642
Brother...

91
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,007
Tomboy, waiting to die here?

92
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,411
Who's kicking me?

93
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,812
- Oh! No!
- Damn fatty, how dare you?

94
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,717
Uncle, not my fault!

95
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,525
Go to hell?

96
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,530
Go away!
My daddy's going to kill someone.

97
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,666
- Oh! My car!
- Go away...

98
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,904
Don't go away, bastard!

99
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,076
With $30 million, you can eat anything!

100
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,113
Stop eating, try something.

101
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,355
Replace them with 3 bags of joss money.

102
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,753
It won't work. What now?

103
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,017
I never dreamt of
having such a hell lot of money.

104
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,825
Why not simply let us have it?

105
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,730
It may upset the finance.
You may get shot.

106
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,436
You know how much money
is in circulation?

107
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,630
Over $20 billion!

108
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,638
So $30 million is negligible.

109
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,739
- Sorry.
- Why not?

110
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,744
It ain't easy, did you steal before?

111
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,381
Let me demonstrate to you.

112
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,882
Thief! Show it.

113
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,558
I'm caught. See you at prison!

114
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,222
We can get some help.

115
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,855
There are only three days left.

116
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,230
Have you got thieves in your family?

117
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,336
Your father!

118
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,301
You always said he is a dumb thief.

119
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,701
Eat now!

120
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,734
Where can we find the thieves?

121
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,318
"Government Correctional Services"

122
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,406
We'd better give up.

123
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,137
What's wrong?

124
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,746
The prison scared me.

125
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,370
It seems specially made for me.

126
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,676
Shut up! Someone's coming out.

127
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,390
It's him. I can see he's the one.

128
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,663
Remember,
we're dealing with the big guys.

129
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,129
Show your dare.

130
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,029
Yes, boss.

131
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,602
Come on.

132
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,480
Friend, we have got a tough deal.

133
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,047
Have you got the guts to do it?

134
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,749
What kind of a tough deal?

135
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,520
Have you got the guts?

136
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,026
Morning, warden.

137
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,728
Warden? Finished.

138
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,034
What kind of deal is it?

139
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,263
Clean all the beaches in Hong Kong.

140
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,175
It's voluntary, tough, eh?

141
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,043
Have you got the guts?

142
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:43,940
Guess you're busy.

143
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,573
Why don't you recommend someone?

144
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,278
Any prisoners discharged today, sir?

145
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,989
- One.
- Thank you.

146
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,548
Let's go.

147
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,347
He looks miserable.

148
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:24,445
Must have spent years in jail.

149
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,557
Don't get us involved.

150
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,860
Mark give hell. Please!

151
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:33,431
This is our only chance.

152
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:51,745
Fatty, let's find out his background.

153
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,286
What's it, kid?

154
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,691
His accent shows he's mainlander.

155
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:04,921
Did you get jailed for illegal entry?

156
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,089
You can't get going
without even an I.D. Card.

157
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,162
What's it?

158
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,234
We need you for a big deal.

159
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:17,364
Oh no. I've decided to go straight now.

160
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,007
Find someone else.

161
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,583
Damn Baldy.

162
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,511
Big Mouth! My goodness.

163
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,383
What are you doing?

164
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,963
I can go straight after I get rich.

165
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,622
Go...

166
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,863
What's wrong with that beige car?

167
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,936
It's orange.

168
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,403
- Beige...
- Orange...

169
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,666
It makes no difference.

170
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:50,638
Orange.

171
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,902
Beige or orange?

172
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,403
Quiet! It's beigy orange!

173
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,440
- Who's he?
- Inspector!

174
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,952
So he's an Inspector!

175
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,349
Let's go!

176
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,786
Bitch, you're more scared.

177
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,295
Is his car stolen?

178
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,297
Yes, it is.

179
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,867
I told you to borrow, not to steal it.

180
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,527
Where to borrow in such a hurry?

181
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,663
Don't... don't go up a slope!

182
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,140
Why didn't you say so?

183
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,010
It's running out of gasoline.

184
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,478
- How do you know?
- Look!

185
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,375
It really is empty.

186
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,453
I'll break the fastest record
of getting caught.

187
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,383
It's reversing!

188
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,650
Pull the handbrake, quick!

189
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:44,229
Damn! You kids drive me, nuts.

190
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,163
Last time I got caught by Big Mouth

191
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,326
in a similar situation.

192
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,965
Watch out!

193
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,577
Don't...

194
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,487
Damn Baldy!

195
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,264
Don't look! Run!

196
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,269
Run... Quick!

197
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,039
Here's a car!

198
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,514
My goodness!

199
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,452
- What are you doing?
- Snake... I'm afraid of snakes!

200
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,819
It's all right!

201
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,686
- Get in...
- No... I won't even if you killed me.

202
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,726
Why did you get such a wreck, you idiots.

203
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,560
Why didn't you get a good one?

204
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,599
When a good car comes along,

205
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,440
lie down in the road.

206
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,042
The car stops, we take it.

207
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,705
Fatty, lie down,
or you sleep with the snake.

208
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,545
- You, too!
- And you?

209
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,311
I'm coming.

210
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,985
You too!

211
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,385
Lie down!

212
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,925
All lie down! Come on.

213
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,052
No, it's safer here.

214
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,639
Don't be silly!

215
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,642
- Are you all right?
- Where's the car?

216
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,712
My legs are numb!

217
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,543
You're damned!

218
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,014
You're unsympathetic.

219
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,482
Another car's coming!

220
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,450
Let's take this car.

221
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,456
Let's take this car.

222
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,227
What's so funny?

223
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,233
What's so funny?

224
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,668
Tell me how to make money
when you stop laughing.

225
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,104
We don't even know your name.

226
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,942
General Chuen was my godfather.

227
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:15,046
My last name is Chuen.

228
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,511
Bluffer.

229
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,843
You all know my name already.

230
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,076
Tell me the secret.

231
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,120
Don't tell him the secret.

232
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,157
Unless you take us with you
to vow at the Chuen Temple.

233
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,854
No way, I'm a Catholic!

234
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,955
Good! I'll give you a break?

235
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,930
Stop at any Church.

236
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,899
- Okay!
- Bad!

237
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,046
Quick? Go in! Go in!

238
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,543
Get going...

239
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,279
Do I look sincere?

240
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,392
If I ever betrayed you,

241
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,553
I'd be knocked down by a car,

242
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:10,157
choked in eating...

243
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,495
get no heir after getting married.

244
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,201
Get pimples on my head...

245
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,844
Sleep in a coffin and die in water bed.

246
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,006
And have no girlfriend before 90.
Wicked enough?

247
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,016
Sure, enough to poison even the listener!

248
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,382
Well, tell us what it's all about.

249
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,352
What sort of windfall you have in mind?

250
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,155
3 bags of bank-notes ready to be burnt.

251
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,854
Right... Locked in the incinerator.

252
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,724
- How much is that?
- $30 million.

253
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:39,990
Once more.

254
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,622
$30 million.

255
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,763
In that Incinerator Station?

256
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:49,703
Tsing Yi Incinerator Station.

257
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,865
Where?

258
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:51,976
An iron cage on the 1st floor.

259
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,873
Anything else hidden from me?

260
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,909
No!

261
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,913
In fact, I should go straight.

262
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,618
Backing out after knowing the secret?

263
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,313
Even a straight forward man needs money.

264
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,754
What do you mean?

265
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,816
Count me in.

266
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,726
Where are you going?

267
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,228
To a sweetheart
I haven't seen in six months.

268
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,326
What shall I get her?

269
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,594
- Money, of course!
- Maniac!

270
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,294
- Diamond.
- You must be crazy.

271
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:23,169
- Roses.
- You're smart.

272
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,772
I'm rich...

273
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,515
This time I'm rich.

274
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,487
Quick...

275
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,687
Let me get in first!

276
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,949
Sister Maria's brought me trouble again!

277
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,986
I must rush to help 3 lambs
and an old fox.

278
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,125
Sister Maria...
You've come at the right time.

279
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,090
I was looking for you!

280
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,253
Why you gave
so little for family expenses.

281
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,831
Shut up! I played mahjong.

282
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,830
And you said I neglected the children.

283
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,696
I wanted a divorce
and you said God wouldn't agree.

284
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,097
- Did I?
- What should we do?

285
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,829
Quiet! Let me finish.

286
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,964
I, Maria, approve of your divorce.

287
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,073
Effective immediately.

288
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,370
Maria...

289
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,242
- I'm free now!
- Stop dreaming!

290
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,058
What now?

291
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,725
Wait or get out! Bye-bye.

292
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,227
That's your fault to bring an old crook.

293
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,067
Who's backbiting me?

294
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,435
Him! Her!

295
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,471
I'm used to it.

296
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,475
Let's be cooperative.

297
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,309
You two go and get the blueprint.

298
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,851
And wait for me
at the shipyard in Aberdeen.

299
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,146
Okay...

300
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,255
We can't make it.

301
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,881
It's $30 million! No price's too great.

302
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,084
Yes...

303
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,195
- Okay, no problem.
- Don't be cocky.

304
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:29,023
You take me to that Incinerator Station.

305
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,601
Let me see if there's really $30 million.

306
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,700
And according to rule, it's 30/70.

307
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,743
You get 30 and I get 70.

308
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,937
I'm professional and you're amateur.

309
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,207
As in soccer
you got only travel expenses.

310
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,612
No way?

311
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,049
He's right! I used to get only that.

312
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,176
Hell with you!

313
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,190
Want to fight me? Come on!

314
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,854
Baldhead, it's been a long time.

315
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,190
- Where did you go?
- I've just returned from the sea.

316
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,435
So you're back.

317
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,049
Baldhead, I...

318
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,678
You don't have to tell me,
I know you're lonely.

319
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,214
You do?

320
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,724
I know what to do.

321
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,522
Wait!

322
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:36,623
Hurry up then! Hurry up!
I've waited for 6 months.

323
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,061
Baldy.

324
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,342
Come on...

325
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,812
What time is it now?

326
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,450
Back from prison?

327
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,713
What? I returned from the sea.

328
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:00,222
Get out of here.

329
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,024
I live here.

330
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,124
What? When have you moved in?

331
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,754
Never mind, go out and have coffee.

332
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,457
Come on, sweetheart!

333
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,001
Only one minute will do!

334
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,129
Baldy, we've been married for 3 months.

335
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,872
Yes!

336
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,176
You've got guts. All ready made.

337
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,248
Baldy!

338
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,747
Goodbye.

339
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,692
Going to sea again?

340
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,891
Damn...

341
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,741
So soon?

342
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:55,971
A fast shooter!

343
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,775
An expert must be fast.

344
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,248
Right, no time wasted and nobody hurt.

345
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,285
- What did you say?
- I got an idea.

346
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,389
Fling a snake in
and play the Pest Control.

347
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,649
And you'll look around.

348
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,224
What a lousy idea!

349
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,271
Sir, what a shame.

350
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,170
You're interfering. Where's Baldy?

351
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,974
Over there.

352
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,611
Take him.

353
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,484
He must be up to something.

354
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,919
Follow him.

355
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:58,542
Sir, last time you framed Baldy up,

356
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,771
and he got 6 months as a result.

357
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,041
He cheated my god sister a diamond ring.

358
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,378
I swore to fix him each time I see him.

359
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,617
I'll never let him go.

360
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,636
Fatty, wait for me at the entrance.

361
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,865
Be ready to go anytime, it's not safe.

362
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,475
Okay, go now.

363
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,165
Reverse! He saw it.

364
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,104
Watch it. Let me go up and see.

365
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,677
You can't get away!

366
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,527
Hello!

367
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,162
I know you, you're that old fox.

368
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,997
Don't run!

369
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,838
I mean you're damned okay.

370
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,866
You're damned! Don't run!

371
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,469
Kid, let me!

372
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,239
- Stop!
- Open the door.

373
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,112
Let me get in first!

374
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:52,788
Stop!

375
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,448
Go!

376
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,086
Don't run!

377
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,861
Where can you go?

378
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,360
It's killing me!

379
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,196
Well, you've seen
the 3 bags of bank-notes!

380
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,704
We can get it easily!

381
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:17,074
Snakes... not my business!

382
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,259
Help...

383
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,531
Help.

384
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,698
Sister, help!

385
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,898
Calm down! I'll help you.

386
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,440
God, help me!

387
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,942
Snakes!

388
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,082
My behind!

389
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,659
Leave me alone! I don't want God now!

390
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,558
Blast! Snakes!

391
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,096
Snakes!

392
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:21,801
Don't... don't tug at me. I can't breathe!

393
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,515
Help! I can't swim!

394
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,679
Don't worry! I'll teach you now!

395
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,791
I'm sinking...

396
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,053
That's no way to swim!

397
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,992
- Who are you?
- Hey!

398
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,433
Why are you hanging on my car?

399
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,334
Well, why am I hanging up here?

400
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,968
Get down!

401
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,976
What? I'm a policeman.

402
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,637
Being pursued by a crook. Go quick!

403
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,508
Don't look! Go!

404
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,550
Okay, sit still.

405
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,623
Your driving technique is not bad.

406
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,885
Nonsense!

407
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,927
Frizzy, pay me back for my glass!

408
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,504
- Bitch you...
- Baldy...

409
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,505
Stop that! Pay me...

410
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,971
Don't go away! Pay me back!

411
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,422
Plenty of dogs! I won't go down!

412
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,097
Baldhead!

413
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,229
I'm not baldheaded.

414
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,787
Frizzy, don't let me see you again.

415
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,990
So it's you! Frizzy kiddo.

416
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,562
So it's you!

417
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,555
This kick is killing!

418
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,963
Stop! Why are you baldheaded?

419
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,194
Why are you baldheaded?

420
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,838
Bitch, stop that!

421
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,306
My head's bald!

422
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,143
Hit me?

423
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,272
Thief...

424
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,405
What are you doing?

425
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,678
Nothing! Nothing at all!

426
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,916
Scream, and I'll gag you!

427
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,953
Thief!

428
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,260
Chuen!

429
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,296
Don't go in!

430
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,927
Come here!

431
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,169
Stand there!

432
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,205
Get rid of your jinx.

433
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,144
Run faster when you're chased again.

434
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,243
Several young men are waiting.

435
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,784
What are you up to?

436
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,515
Stay out of this
and you'll stand to gain.

437
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,693
You've never spoken the truth, kid.

438
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,031
Now it's true, we're rich!

439
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,433
- All fixed.
- Sit down! How's everything?

440
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,508
All fixed.

441
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,803
Sit still, Mr. Lin.

442
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,669
Over here. Take a look at this blueprint.

443
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,712
The best way would be through the gutter.

444
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:57,114
There's a house right behind the station.

445
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,519
The entrance of the gutter
is in the garden.

446
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,152
How do you know
it leads to the incinerator.

447
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,260
The blueprint was designed by me.

448
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,794
Are you sure it's not clogged?

449
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,490
Never, I drained it 6 times a year.

450
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,033
The female owner of that house
is a designer Feng.

451
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,069
To get in,

452
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,536
we must fix her first.

453
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,506
But it seems she's not easygoing.

454
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,006
It all depends on you.

455
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,341
"She's the girl in my dreams"

456
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,882
"With a figure as shapely as can be"

457
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,476
"I yearn to woo her and marry her"

458
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,283
"And even the it means the hosting of'

459
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,986
"A big wedding party. I'm ready"

460
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,856
"To enslave myself to win her heart"

461
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,396
"But a poor and miserable man like me"

462
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,159
"is only snubbed by her snobbish mother"

463
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,030
"She puts money above anything else"

464
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,866
"And jeers at me for my vain ambition"

465
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,334
"So I really can do nothing"

466
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,339
"till fortune smiles upon me"

467
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:58,381
"And I need a windfall
to get me off the hook"

468
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,787
"Only if I were rich"

469
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,057
"Could I vent my grievances"

470
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,525
"May the tide turn in my favor"

471
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,493
"May luck be with me from now on"

472
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,366
"So I can make a good showing"

473
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,993
"I swear I'd bring a beautiful world"

474
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,471
"For both you and me"

475
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,372
"At last luck has knocked at my door"

476
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,205
"With unabated vigor to"

477
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,804
"Make you dream come true"

478
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,376
"When it comes to money"

479
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,417
"Everybody is in the same religion"

480
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:39,045
"You can't raise your head without it"

481
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,652
"I really can do nothing"

482
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,656
"Till fortune smiles upon me"

483
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:48,993
"And I need a windfall
to get me off the hook"

484
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,332
Cigar...

485
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,705
I feel the smell of cigar.

486
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,274
Are you alone?

487
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,480
You didn't expect me
to bring more people?

488
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,479
How did you get to be like this?

489
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,247
Come...

490
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,155
I kissed a lioness in the zoo.

491
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,917
- Nonsense!
- Liar!

492
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,524
Who are they?

493
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,559
This is an Engineer
who designed the blueprint.

494
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,361
Thank you. You may go home and sleep.

495
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,470
You agreed that I get a cut.

496
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,468
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

497
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,970
Who's he?

498
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,665
He... he drains the gutter.

499
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,605
He'll get a cut too?

500
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,506
Me, too.

501
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,340
Is this blind man going to lead us?

502
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,914
No, he heard of our secret.

503
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,950
And followed us.

504
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,519
Well, let the dough
be split thin among us!

505
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,350
Tell the whole world
to send someone to split it!

506
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,452
Is she going to lead us to Heaven?

507
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,702
She's my benefactor.

508
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,395
Please tell them!

509
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,638
The Lord said we're 3 sheep.

510
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,901
And he's an old fox.

511
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,135
Damn! How dare you curse me?

512
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,212
You use violence, God won't forgive you.

513
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,907
- Sister, watch out for the Lord!
- Sorry!

514
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:17,284
It hurts! I give up...

515
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:23,817
Well, the Lord said
a thief can't enter Heaven.

516
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,590
Fatty wants to go to Heaven.

517
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,666
Do you?

518
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,062
Sister, I'd rather not go to Heaven!

519
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,705
Why, Fatty?

520
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,273
I've no friends in Heaven.

521
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,566
Then I must inform the police!

522
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:48,117
Thank you, Sister, for guiding me.

523
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,619
You made me think back of my past.

524
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,585
I'm now repenting!

525
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,854
The jail was such an ordeal. Thank you.

526
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,895
Have you ever been in jail?

527
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,260
Feel it. It's now creased!

528
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,391
Not you, she!

529
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,399
I wouldn't care to!

530
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,730
Let's disband then.

531
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,133
Okay!

532
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,796
Where's Sister?

533
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,603
What about you three?

534
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,070
I knew I'd never be rich.

535
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,702
Let's go before the police arrive.

536
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,144
Where are you going, old fox?

537
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,880
Easy, Sister.

538
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,182
I don't worry about those 3 lambs.

539
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,884
But you must stick with me for 3 days.

540
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,192
Dare you ever get out of my sight?

541
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:34,789
- Dare you?
- No!

542
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,199
- You really have a way.
- You're superb!

543
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,242
A Sister's taking Baldhead to Heaven!

544
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,777
Taking him to a motel?

545
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,380
Let's do it ourselves.

546
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,412
Do it ourselves?

547
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,514
Get the blueprint.

548
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,983
We've to get the blueprint all the same.

549
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,396
When will you embrace the faith?

550
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,967
Sister, I must go and talk to my brother.

551
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,593
You don't have to follow me so closely.

552
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,966
Okay!

553
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:27,013
What to do if someone is in the way?

554
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,941
Just play tough.

555
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,151
Fix her for me.

556
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,283
I don't hit women.

557
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,892
Do it for $30 million?

558
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,123
- How much?
- $30 million.

559
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,097
I can't stand it.

560
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:48,963
Are you sure you must use violence?

561
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,869
Lock her up for 3 days.

562
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,100
And feed her like a kitten.

563
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,235
Sister, do you eat fish?

564
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,947
I'm afraid of the bones.

565
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,479
Put some more fish bone to choke her.

566
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,451
- How much?
- $30 million.

567
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,199
- Get going!
- Trying to run?

568
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,562
Coming...

569
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,064
- Fixed.
- Get going!

570
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,770
Fixed. Where's Baldy?

571
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,537
My back!

572
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,021
My back! Oh, my back!

573
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,887
Master! Help!

574
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,188
Don't ruin me like that!

575
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,490
- Let me off.
- Okay!

576
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,226
You're dumb! Tell her to let go.

577
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,928
Put me down quick!

578
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,577
Fan... Come...

579
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,880
She's terrific!

580
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,884
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

581
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,079
Kill her.

582
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,622
Oh no,
not in the presence of General Kwan.

583
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,022
She's a nun, she's a Sister.

584
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:17,889
Anna? I must never do it then!

585
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:23,864
I'm now a common female! Come on!

586
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,861
Bitch, how dare you?

587
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,097
I'm Boxer Liang!

588
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,572
Bastard Liang? Boxer Liang! Show power!

589
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,414
She's terrific!

590
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,116
$30 million!

591
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,853
I wouldn't starve even if I were maimed.

592
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,293
Hit her!

593
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,329
You're good for nothing.

594
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,367
I'm not yet ready! Stop!

595
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,227
Get her!

596
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,768
My back!

597
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,701
Hold on!

598
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,774
Where's the money? Tell me!

599
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,406
- Knock her down first.
- Nonsense.

600
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:16,753
Have you got a light?

601
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,980
Take your cigarette away!
Where's the money?

602
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,205
Damn, you're tough!

603
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,809
You're so mean.

604
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,001
You're not a nun.

605
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,703
You're a witch, a shrew.

606
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,677
An old maid... A hag, a jilted woman.

607
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,682
Go on! I'll "electrocute" you...

608
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,948
I'll electrocute you!

609
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,414
Sorry... Stop that!

610
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,060
- I'll kill you...
- Sorry.

611
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,761
It's fun! Damn bitch! Damn old maid!

612
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,628
Someone's slipping away.

613
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,399
You kicked me!

614
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,903
So what?

615
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,642
Dare you do it again?

616
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,940
- He's beating up a woman.
- I didn't!

617
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,173
My back!

618
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,785
Trying to run? I'll kill you!

619
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,349
Baldy, don't come to me again on this!

620
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,754
Bitch, you don't care a damn about me!

621
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,796
My head! Is it alright?

622
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,806
- Lots of stars!
- Are you sure?

623
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:06,521
Is there no place for me
in this wide world?

624
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,927
Sister, what do you think?

625
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:14,330
God is fair.
Heaven's spacious and beautiful.

626
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,371
I don't want to go to Heaven.
Waste of energy!

627
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,903
Well, let's forsake him,
let's do it ourselves.

628
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,247
Cheers!

629
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,315
Wait, we may be accused of betrayal.

630
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,349
Idiot.

631
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,350
At worst we'll give them a cut.

632
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,045
Right, we won't let them down.

633
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,323
How much?

634
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,782
$10,000 each?

635
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,018
So much? You're mad? Are you rich?

636
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:37,889
How much then?

637
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,791
$10,000 for all of them.

638
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,894
Our conscience is clear! Let's drink!

639
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,097
It's cold!

640
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,033
What are you doing?

641
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,210
It was cold last night.
Didn't want you to catch cold.

642
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,211
You're nice. Thank you.

643
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,321
Blessed be the Lord!

644
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,793
Something's wrong?

645
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,399
I've decided to give up.

646
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,740
And I'm going to persuade my friends too.

647
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,275
Are you going or not?

648
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,308
Of course!

649
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,640
But I can't with the suit I'm wearing.

650
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,146
Lend me some money to redeem my tuxedo.

651
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,250
What about these gold watches and chains?

652
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,945
They're all fakes.

653
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:12,922
Okay!

654
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,263
Wait a minute.

655
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,514
My late wife's photo.

656
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,051
I must print a few for souvenir.

657
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,091
Photo-finishing.

658
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,197
- Print 2 dozen, I'll come this afternoon.
- Yes!

659
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,303
Merry Villa - To Let only.

660
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,203
Pimp Tak! This is Bluffer.

661
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,399
Wrong number!

662
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,909
Don't hang up!
I'm not calling up for money.

663
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,571
I'll introduce you a beautiful bird.

664
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,081
You're not in this line. Any good birds?

665
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,816
I've changed after six months in prison.

666
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,683
I now have a new gimmick.

667
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,790
A new breakthrough.

668
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,926
What breakthrough? Tell me!

669
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,325
Great! Now new packing is in vogue.

670
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,432
I'll have her packaged from head to toe.

671
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,089
Is she beautiful?

672
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,599
Better than Lin Ching-hsia.

673
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,029
Really? What about her figure?

674
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,940
Great! Like a hairy ape!

675
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,412
- What!
- Never mind.

676
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,945
Stop nagging.
Inform those old clients to try.

677
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,744
Hurry up then.

678
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,916
Coming now!

679
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,088
Why are you so late?

680
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,095
Why such a crowd?

681
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,526
We need men to make money.

682
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,896
- Watch out!
- I know.

683
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,533
I know you need me now.

684
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,334
- Well.
- Sit down first.

685
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,737
Don't be in the way.

686
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,603
- Go in.
- Okay.

687
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,676
Calm down.

688
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,177
Go in and get ready.

689
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,015
One grand!

690
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,723
I must call the police! There's a fight!

691
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,050
Let's go...

692
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,660
Police! Got a ticket from the police!

693
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,162
- Assaulting police?
- No, reporting!

694
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,765
There's a fight at the hotel upstairs.

695
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,264
A Sister was injured by whore mongers.

696
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,872
Those whore mongers were hit by police!

697
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,176
You're more eloquent, say it! Excuse me!

698
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,978
Don't bluff! Stay!

699
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,882
I'll be waiting in the car.

700
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,728
Who's it? Coming!

701
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,402
It's you!

702
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,775
Open up! Feng,
I've brought you a fortune.

703
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,216
What are you doing?

704
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,719
Coming in if you dare!

705
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,753
My vase is expensive!

706
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,829
It's expensive.

707
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,107
- This is more expensive!
- I don't care.

708
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,270
- Catch!
- Don't.

709
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,546
- You're clumsy.
- Baldy, I'll call the police.

710
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,247
I'll make good for you.

711
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,359
My hard-earned dough. Take it!

712
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,563
Please take it.
I'll be grateful if you do.

713
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,530
I'm despicable.

714
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:22,868
Since I met you,

715
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:30,976
I've been thinking of you,
yearn to be with you...

716
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,476
And go to your bedroom to...

717
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,912
do what I'd like to do with you.

718
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:43,720
Let me lie down and put it in!

719
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,660
What a clumsy sex crook I am.

720
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,502
I'll find her soon.

721
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,366
I've found it.

722
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:03,679
Having a good time?

723
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,915
Kick!

724
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,392
I'll support it!

725
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,026
Great!

726
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,793
Wait! Let me say something first.

727
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,062
It concerns a wind fall of $30 million.

728
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,263
You'll get a cut of $1 million Okay?

729
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,735
So little for me? He'll with you!

730
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,303
- Ouch! I'm finished!
- Don't finish!

731
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:37,343
Damn...

732
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,471
Are you alright? Why didn't you tell me?

733
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,880
With $30 million everything's okay.

734
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,879
I never thought you'd be so tough.

735
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,988
I thought we were now two in one.

736
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,214
What?

737
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,723
Here it is! Turn!

738
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,928
We're going to get this woman.

739
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,069
Okay!

740
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,802
If she reacts normally, I'll do it.

741
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,811
If she's pervert, Fatty goes.

742
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,482
If she's lesbian, let Tomboy do it.

743
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,379
Where's Tomboy?

744
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,618
Do it for the sake of the dough.

745
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:19,980
I know you don't have the taste.

746
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:22,455
But for $30 million, anything goes.

747
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,457
Come on...

748
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,825
Isn't that great?

749
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,462
Is Baldy here?

750
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,600
Remember to fix these!

751
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,270
- What about my cut?
- How much did I say just now?

752
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:43,276
$10 million.

753
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,913
- Would I be so generous?
- Yes.

754
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,742
Okay, go and make a cup of coffee.

755
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:47,941
Okay.

756
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,709
Add sugar and milk!

757
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,755
We're rich!

758
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,822
This time we aren't going to miss.

759
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:07,365
It's okay. Everything's okay!

760
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,367
What are you doing?

761
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,909
- To make fun of you! Come here!
- What?

762
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:19,339
Come here and you'll see.

763
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,507
Dress up in one minute.

764
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,209
Or I'll have someone to castrate you.

765
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,952
A slip again!

766
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,855
Quiet!

767
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,566
Game over!

768
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,438
He's dressing.

769
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,633
You're not like match.

770
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:50,041
Quiet! I'm racking my brains.

771
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,513
Well, you won't get hurt!

772
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,684
Sorry!

773
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,369
Big Mouth?

774
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,971
Bluffer...

775
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,970
Big Mouth's here!

776
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,113
I'm going!

777
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,512
Hurry! Bye-bye!

778
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:39,192
What are you up to?

779
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,223
Get in quick!

780
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,398
You bastards again!

781
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,010
What's your offence?
Robbing a jewelry shop?

782
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,236
So serious?

783
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,141
What's your offence now?

784
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,942
Attempt to have sex
with ill-gotten money.

785
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,015
What do you mean?

786
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,415
Whore mongering? Stop being so highbrow.

787
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,048
- Are you the Inspector?
- Yes. Miss.

788
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,746
Why give me such a hell?

789
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,756
My duty requires that.

790
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,689
Inspector, we can't find Baldy.

791
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:20,827
Let me out! Don't do that!

792
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,335
Here...

793
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,476
What's going on...

794
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,881
Close the door!

795
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,379
Excuse me!

796
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:43,014
Sorry for putting you in here for.

797
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,421
One night, so you won't be in our way.

798
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,653
Don't worry,
we'll reserve one cut for you.

799
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,855
We won't keep it
all for ourselves like you.

800
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,861
- He can't hear us.
- He can't.

801
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,266
You talk and you act,
let him die comforted.

802
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,731
Sorry, we had no choice.

803
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:03,505
You tried to get rid of us first!

804
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,707
You made it... Jump!

805
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,882
Waves!

806
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,783
Damn, you're dirty!

807
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,819
Look!

808
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:20,086
How come?

809
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,494
Can't be opened! It's spinning!

810
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,965
He may get drowned!

811
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,070
How long will it go on?

812
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:29,466
Five minutes for a tablecloth.

813
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,903
A dirty man may take longer.

814
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,367
If this goes on,

815
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,776
he may die.

816
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:39,479
Stop...

817
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,812
It won't stop, it will turn back.

818
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:47,719
How are you?

819
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,382
Poor Baldhead. Try to stop it!

820
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,585
Let's take a chance.

821
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,665
It's stopped!

822
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:07,275
Careful!

823
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,810
Help him.

824
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,813
No need.

825
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,476
The room's spinning.

826
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,352
- Be careful!
- Sit tight!

827
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,854
Sorry to have caused you this.

828
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,690
Out of my way! Don't touch me!

829
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,123
Are you repenting now,
after the brainwashing?

830
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,664
Why are you so crafty?

831
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,370
What? It's a fight for an ideal.

832
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,264
Have you got any ideal?

833
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,377
Which school did you come from?

834
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,078
I do have an ideal.

835
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,007
What's this?

836
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,176
Hawaii! That's not much of a demand!

837
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:55,155
When I was 20, I yearned for a sum of
money to settle down in Hawaii.

838
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,449
No reason for you to hog our shares too.

839
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,684
What?

840
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,756
I wanted to be the vanguard.

841
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,326
What do you mean?

842
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,965
You don't even know that?

843
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,795
Which school do you came from?

844
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:11,765
Look you're the country's mainstay.

845
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,602
You can't be a thief?

846
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,108
Only I am fit for this job.

847
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:19,510
Did I ever say I won't give you your cut?

848
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,310
- Yes.
- I'm not talking to you.

849
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,042
Miss, you're understanding.

850
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,618
Did I say that?

851
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,147
- Yes.
- Lousy bitch!

852
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,759
Speak up! Answer 'Yes' or 'No'.

853
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,657
Did I ever say that?

854
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,560
Say 'Yes',
and I'll strangle you to death!

855
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,393
- Yes or No?
- No!

856
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,263
No...

857
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,473
My gold chain has faded.

858
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,571
The glass has cracked.

859
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:53,376
Even this fake jade is lost. Happy.

860
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,412
And the watchcase too.

861
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,250
I'll find it for you. It's getting short!

862
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:04,188
It's wet. Don't catch cold.

863
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,525
Be nice and find the watchcase for me.

864
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,331
What's it?

865
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,143
Would he ever slip away?

866
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,504
What?

867
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,371
Trying to hog everything again?

868
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,972
Don't be suspicious.
Man is by nature kind.

869
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,984
- He's muttering nonsense.
- People can change.

870
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,386
Come here.

871
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,621
- I was right!
- A good man!

872
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,729
Something to see.

873
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,993
- The watchcase has been found.
- Good boy.

874
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,861
- Mr. Chuen, sorry.
- Never mind.

875
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,572
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

876
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:51,671
Never mind.

877
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,174
- To see what?
- Go in and you'll see.

878
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,310
Why is it missing?

879
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,506
What do you want?

880
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,280
Kids, stay here for the night.

881
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,852
I must make money.

882
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,249
- What a fox!
- Tso Sho.

883
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,254
- Shih Chien.
- Chiang Chung-ping.

884
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,686
- Mar Ka!
- Mar Ka!

885
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,052
Is Mar Ka crafty?

886
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,993
Who isn't crafty, idiot?

887
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:19,158
There are big and small villains.

888
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:20,860
But I was forced by circumstances.

889
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,129
My mammy wouldn't feed me
when I was a child.

890
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,864
And I had someone else feed me.

891
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,042
When my teacher expelled me from school,

892
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,734
I forced him to join the underworld.

893
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,276
When I got nothing to eat,

894
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,880
I eat everything.

895
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,709
- Where's that smart guy.
- Go on!

896
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,878
As I said. I'm not crafty at all.

897
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,989
Crafty is not enough, you must be wicked.

898
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,690
You must be extremely wicked.

899
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,691
Small wickedness builds up the country.

900
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,194
Big wickedness conquers the world.

901
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,036
But sometimes it won't work.

902
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,229
Let me give you the antidote.

903
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,304
There's no key! What now?

904
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:01,805
Damn Baldy!

905
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,607
Don't close the door! You...

906
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:09,115
Bye-bye.

907
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,978
Don't say bye-bye!

908
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:17,320
I was only joking. Damn...

909
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,955
My father!

910
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,059
I'll go to steal upstairs.

911
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:22,664
Lure him away.

912
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,357
- Me to lure her father away?
- Yes!

913
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,161
Go now! He wants to send you away.

914
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:27,700
Get going!

915
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,862
Get going! You'll be alright!

916
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,668
Only an accident!

917
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,676
What can you do?

918
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,814
Come up and have a fight! Come...

919
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,776
Who are you? Why are you kicking me?

920
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,282
Sorry, I thought it was someone else.

921
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:43,680
Trying to run?

922
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,386
Are they really worth $1,000?

923
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,985
Sure, but I must give 10% to my father.

924
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,229
10% of $30 million?

925
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,867
- That means...
- $3 million!

926
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,796
Otherwise, I'll take them back upstairs.

927
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,734
Okay, we have no choice. Let's go.

928
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,508
Father, I'll repay you $3 million.

929
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:15,140
$3 million? For me?

930
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:18,405
Bad, she's blocking the gutter.

931
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:19,578
Lure her away.

932
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,647
- Me again?
- You're better for the job.

933
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:22,910
For the sake of the money.

934
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,111
- The money?
- Go now.

935
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,749
- Who's it?
- Baldy!

936
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,556
I'm rich...

937
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,466
Hello! How are you?

938
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:58,843
Red and green beans
bring you lots of gas.

939
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:03,989
Oh, My god!

940
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,621
Guardroom.

941
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,096
- Mr. Wang!
- I'm Chiang!

942
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,497
Just now I saw a monster!

943
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,866
Hurry up! She might see us
after she finishes calling.

944
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,097
Keep calm! She won't finish so soon.

945
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,002
Wearing a bikini!

946
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,434
Why has she got that?

947
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,044
I didn't notice it.

948
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:24,270
What a woman!

949
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,347
- What's it?
- Wait, let me see more of it.

950
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,847
What are you doing? What about the money?

951
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,954
With the money, we can see anything.

952
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,923
Well, I've gone too far.

953
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,585
Forget it, you won't believe it anyway.

954
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,396
Who cares?

955
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:50,064
Why is the floor dry?

956
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,639
You scared me!

957
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:57,610
It came from outside!
Just now I saw monster.

958
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,914
Forget it!

959
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,381
What are we going to do?

960
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,145
Well, shut up and start.

961
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:05,082
Dose everything get ready?

962
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,381
Yes, they're all there.

963
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:11,622
Darling, let's have a kiss.

964
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,859
Wait till we get the money.

965
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,306
What are you doing?

966
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:34,780
I am a thief!

967
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,008
Now?

968
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,915
Yes, I designed it myself.

969
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,047
Maniac!

970
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,250
They've all gone to steal the money.

971
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,152
It's finished.

972
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,486
What do you mean?

973
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,663
You tried your best to help them.

974
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,128
I'll take over from now on.

975
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,096
No, it's not yet finished.

976
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,292
It's the police responsibility.

977
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,962
No, it's the god's responsibility.

978
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,140
Wang, come and see.

979
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,077
What's it?

980
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,842
Anyway it's kicks... Quick!

981
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,008
Great!

982
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:56,690
Over there.

983
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,258
Come on quick!

984
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,714
Up there!

985
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,897
- $30 million!
- Hurry up!

986
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,276
$30 million.

987
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,483
Hurry up!

988
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,458
"There's none better than mammy"

989
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:38,718
What has that to do with your mammy?

990
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:40,759
Mammy brought me to this beautiful world.

991
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,593
Nothing?

992
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,843
Let's go over there and see.

993
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,313
- What should we do?
- Hide up.

994
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,424
Over there.

995
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:16,494
Run!

996
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,463
No hurry. A good show.

997
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,932
Look at the expert you brought.

998
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,003
Hurry up!

999
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,478
Hurry up!

1000
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,452
Over there is a hole.

1001
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,383
Go now!

1002
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,560
Close the door.

1003
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,338
Out of the way...

1004
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,441
Quick!

1005
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:22,294
Bastard, it's all joss money!

1006
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,365
- Hush! Quiet!
- Damn you!

1007
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,660
I've an idea.

1008
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,809
Up above.

1009
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,221
Over there.

1010
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:52,591
Little Fatty.

1011
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,025
Over here... quick...

1012
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,824
- Go!
- Quick!

1013
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:58,392
Quick!

1014
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,031
- Mu Lan-hua.
- Catch!

1015
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:10,270
Here, quick. Not here... over there.

1016
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,715
My god! Baldy.

1017
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,161
Catch.

1018
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,428
- Throw it!
- Catch!

1019
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:38,195
Don't move! Don't run. Grab it! Hurry!

1020
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,772
Baldy...

1021
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,639
Don't fight! Every has a cut!

1022
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,246
Let me mix them
and split into 2 portions.

1023
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,972
We get 1 portion;

1024
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:48,946
You 3, 1 portion, Fair?

1025
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,574
- Never! There are only two of you.
- Yes.

1026
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,683
Let me tell you in secret.

1027
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,914
She's got my child in her womb.

1028
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,521
What an insult!

1029
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,383
One more portion!

1030
01:14:58,527 --> 01:14:59,892
Right... Im pregnant!

1031
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,362
- Tell him.
- What?

1032
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,866
She's got our twins inside too.

1033
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,490
Hell with you!

1034
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,365
Let's not quarrel and fight over.

1035
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,666
A little money. You'll suffer.

1036
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:13,608
Come on...

1037
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:16,501
You're big brother, you decide.

1038
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,272
Right! We're only your coolies.

1039
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:20,506
We'll help ourselves then.

1040
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,581
- More partners.
- Damn, more parasites.

1041
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,784
It's been a long time.

1042
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,582
They're trying to run.

1043
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:32,158
Get back the money! Trying to desert me
over such a big deal!

1044
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,455
Had Sister Maria not warned me.

1045
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:38,293
You'd have mad of with the fortune.

1046
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,859
- Who's she?
- No idea.

1047
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,068
I told him that.

1048
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:47,869
I don't want you to follow this old fox.

1049
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,802
You sold me to that pimp.

1050
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,245
Stop!

1051
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,450
- Old fox...
- Maria!

1052
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,678
Don't follow that old fox.

1053
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:02,556
Now it's up to you! Be fair! Speak up!

1054
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,723
He's a villain, he tried to take all.

1055
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,162
Damn you!

1056
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,286
You tried to ruin me!

1057
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,331
Damn Baldy.

1058
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,524
Don't shoot, I'll call the police.

1059
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:14,658
- Okay!
- Don't!

1060
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:16,201
Don't run away or he'll kill us.

1061
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,169
Don't.

1062
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:19,501
- Shut up!
- I won't.

1063
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:20,767
As I said, he's no good.

1064
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,434
If you go on, I'll kill you.

1065
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,706
Shoot, I've dedicated myself to the Lord.

1066
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,940
Don't if you have the guts.

1067
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:30,613
Shoot...

1068
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,718
We'll all spring over you if you shoot.

1069
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:34,947
Right! We're only your coolies.

1070
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,557
A bully like him can stand 6 shots.

1071
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:37,954
Right! Don't be scared.

1072
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,455
I'm silent! Is that against the law?

1073
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,656
Bewitch him.

1074
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,965
- What's his name?
- Inspector Chu!

1075
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:52,563
Insp. Chu, we can never spend it all.

1076
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:56,303
Take 3 bags. They may be real.

1077
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,242
Shut up, Cutie!

1078
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,409
Look, even be calls me a cutie.

1079
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,712
He's blind.

1080
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,958
Stay where you are!

1081
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,059
Hand over the dough.

1082
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:21,395
Or I'll break his bald head.

1083
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,293
Don't...

1084
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:32,004
I'm finished...

1085
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,115
Let's stay for a little longer.

1086
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,276
Well, see how he'll end up.

1087
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,114
To punish him for his lie.

1088
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:45,152
I'll count up to three... One...

1089
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,064
Two...

1090
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,202
Don't! I submit.

1091
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:05,978
And the other three?

1092
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,579
Three.

1093
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,887
- Wait!
- Let's come down!

1094
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,383
Let's go.

1095
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,557
Open all the bags!

1096
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,269
- Open them!
- Wait!

1097
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:36,010
Okay! Don't get tough!

1098
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:40,814
Open it!

1099
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:11,570
How come?

1100
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,308
You fooled us again!

1101
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,939
No, it was he.

1102
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,745
How dare you, Damn Fatty?

1103
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:22,255
Damn fatty, I'll kill you!

1104
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,915
Don't...

1105
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,292
Thank God, only misunderstanding.

1106
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,830
We committed no offence.

1107
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,863
We've a bright future.

1108
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,663
Please get out of
this criminal world with me.

1109
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,537
Okay...

1110
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:42,940
Stop! Is there really $30 million?

1111
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,306
- Where's the money?
- Yes, it's true.

1112
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,346
Speak...

1113
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,541
I swear... if I lie,
my whole family will...

1114
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:53,284
If I ever cheat you, my family will...

1115
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:54,387
Say it.

1116
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:55,989
Get Aids.

1117
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,659
Stand up!

1118
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,395
Who took it?

1119
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:31,556
You really are incorrigible.

1120
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:33,952
I think of it now.

1121
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,563
Who? Speak up.

1122
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,326
Bye-bye, Penniless.

1123
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,299
I'm rich!

1124
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,612
Are you all here to see me off?

1125
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:53,509
Old bore, you're pulling my legs.

1126
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,852
Don't let him get away... Open up...

1127
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,385
Behind quick!

1128
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:09,491
Quiet!

1129
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,760
Let's move him out and "mutilate" him.

1130
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,795
I mean to split the money into 9 shares.

1131
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,707
No... Don't repeat the same mistake!

1132
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,310
Right, Sister's right!

1133
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:26,846
Move him to the hillside.

1134
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,714
Hey! He's gone!

1135
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,078
After him!

1136
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,213
Don't run!

1137
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,561
Come down if you dare! Come down...

1138
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,456
Trying to run?

1139
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:01,972
Don't run...

1140
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:03,816
Toilet paper.

1141
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:05,249
Stop!

1142
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,119
There.

1143
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,890
Go up! Quick!

1144
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:27,942
You can't get away!

1145
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,737
Police behind you!

1146
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:30,867
Police behind you too!

1147
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,537
- You can't fool me.
- You can't fool me either.

1148
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,411
I'll kill you, I'll...

1149
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,145
I have your cut ready.

1150
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,343
So nice?

1151
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:39,885
- Let's split it, okay?
- Show me.

1152
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,318
Stop dreaming.

1153
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:44,085
Don't get away.

1154
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,024
You can't get over!

1155
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,889
What a double dealer.

1156
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,429
Brother, see you in Hawaii.

1157
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,667
The board! The board's here.

1158
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:06,044
Show me... Quick...

1159
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:07,273
Let go.

1160
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:10,077
Put it on.

1161
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:13,452
Damn! Who's so dumb? So short!

1162
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:14,714
It's too short. It won't work.

1163
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:15,914
It's her.

1164
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:17,456
Bitch.

1165
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,890
Why didn't you get a longer one?

1166
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,188
See if you can get away!

1167
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:22,421
It could be fatal!

1168
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,657
What are you doing? Me down the sea.

1169
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,390
Quiet! Look!

1170
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:37,808
Bye-bye!

1171
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:39,704
Bye-bye!

1172
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,816
You still say bye to him. You're stupid.

1173
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:45,078
- Think of something.
- Try to get over!

1174
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:15,672
Miracle...

1175
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:18,142
- What miracle?
- Look!

1176
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,315
Let's order it to rise further, okay?

1177
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,081
Yes...

1178
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,282
Oh, no!

1179
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:33,193
- Who say?
- I didn't...

1180
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,555
I do. It has risen to the top.

1181
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,289
How are you going to go up?

1182
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,462
Over there is a drawbridge!

1183
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,204
Go and see!

1184
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:45,238
- Go away!
- Don't be in the way!

1185
01:25:56,284 --> 01:26:00,653
Come down...

1186
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:06,587
Put him down. Let's kill him.

1187
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,388
I can't sail it!
I'm only playing with it!

1188
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,717
It doesn't work!

1189
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:39,189
Trying to rob?

1190
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:41,628
Let me come up to break your head.

1191
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:47,330
Want money? Come up and get it!

1192
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,407
You'll have to kill me to get it!

1193
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:56,906
You wanted me to go down, idiots.

1194
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,604
Where are the idiots?

1195
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:26,897
So high! I'm scared.

1196
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,776
Don't be afraid.
I'll take care of it here.

1197
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,639
Come over if you dare.

1198
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,041
Stop ballyhooing!

1199
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:34,910
Why not? I'll fight with you.

1200
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,946
I'll kill you, Baldy.

1201
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,052
Sister, I'm damn scared!

1202
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:47,855
Don't worry. God bless you.

1203
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:49,657
He may hit me.

1204
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,299
Don't worry. He never hits a female.

1205
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:10,543
Don't worry! Go down!

1206
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,722
Go down! I'll pray for you.

1207
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,495
- She said you never hit a woman!
- $30 million!

1208
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:40,776
What are you doing?

1209
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,644
- Child turn back.
- Nonsense!

1210
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:47,846
Trying to run?

1211
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,251
Come over if you've the guts.

1212
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:51,858
Sure, with $30 million!

1213
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,925
Don't!

1214
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,460
I'm coming!

1215
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,971
My goodness! What's wrong?

1216
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,403
What are you afraid of?

1217
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:12,240
Many jelly-fish down below.

1218
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:14,412
Don't worry! I'll put you up.

1219
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:15,914
Hold close...

1220
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,446
Damn, how clumsy I am.

1221
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:24,615
- I 'm coming.
- Who?

1222
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,867
Don't run!

1223
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:36,563
Get it back.

1224
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:38,235
Don't let him get away!

1225
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:39,968
Stop...

1226
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:42,533
Don't run! Get it back.

1227
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:44,611
- Lend him a hand, please.
- Coming.

1228
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:49,243
Throw it to me!

1229
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,818
Lord, please give me strength
to save them.

1230
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:57,752
God be blessed!

1231
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,291
Thank you...

1232
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,627
Stop him...

1233
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,327
Don't scramble... It's dangerous.

1234
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:08,093
Look, it's so high!

1235
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,397
It's dangerous! Don't fight!

1236
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:12,999
You can't get away!

1237
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,858
Quick! I've it!

1238
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:58,346
$30 million! It's with me, it's here...

1239
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,888
- Hell with you!
- Don't! Stop that!

1240
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,906
May the Lord give me strength
to save these lost sheep.

1241
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:23,076
Hope on earth.

1242
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:26,337
God loved the world.

1243
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:28,745
Say that again...

1244
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:29,882
What did you say just now?

1245
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:31,541
God loved the world.

1246
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,980
Before that!

1247
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:36,182
Hope on earth.

1248
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:39,919
Hope on earth, we're rich!

1249
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:44,422
"In order to secure your work"

1250
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,334
"You can't help but to work hard"

1251
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,868
"See what the boss looks"

1252
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:55,541
"He looks discontented"

1253
01:31:56,644 --> 01:32:00,171
"In order to make a living,
you're willing to be slaves"

1254
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:03,579
"Being obedience make me unhappy"

1255
01:32:03,951 --> 01:32:07,409
"Work until all parts of my body hurts"

1256
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:11,047
"Hope one day I would be rich"

1257
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,618
"When it comes to money"

1258
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,624
"Everybody is in the same religion"

1259
01:32:14,762 --> 01:32:18,129
"You can't raise your head without it"

1260
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:19,759
"I really can do nothing"

1261
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:21,801
"till fortune smiles upon me"

1262
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:28,034
"And I need a windfall
to get me off the hook"

1263
01:33:03,544 --> 01:33:06,809
"Only if I were rich"

1264
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,848
"Could I vent my grievances"

1265
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:14,347
"May the tide turn in my favor"

1266
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:18,021
"May luck be with me"

1267
01:33:19,327 --> 01:33:21,124
"to enable me to make a good showing"

1268
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:22,752
"I swear I'd bring a beautiful world"

1269
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:26,663
"For both you and me"
