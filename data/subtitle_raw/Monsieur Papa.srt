1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,682
"The sheep were grazing..."

2
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:23,293
"The sheep..."
What then?

3
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:25,213
-"Were grazing."
- OK.

4
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:27,432
"The sheep were grazing."

5
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:30,284
"The butcher was making pate."

6
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:32,369
Not so fast.

7
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:34,737
After "the butcher"?

8
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,305
"Was making pate."

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,203
After pate?

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,203
"The shoemaker was tanning leather."

11
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:00,570
"Leather."

12
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
Then...?

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,410
-"The little town lay stretched out
as time went by."

14
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,753
Come on, Laurent, sit up straight!

15
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,220
You'll ruin your spine.

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,700
When I'm like this,
it makes the letters big...

17
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,191
Especially the O's.

18
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,019
The what?

19
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:43,097
The letter "O".

20
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,460
Come on, sit up straight!

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,902
So, where were we up to?

22
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,378
"The little town..."

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,870
An "O"?

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,444
Where did the "O" come from?

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,866
That's not right, is it?

26
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:04,210
Laurent...

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,020
Of course it's not.

28
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,060
In this case the "O" sound,
is written "AU"...

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,382
and not "O".

30
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,580
I thought it was
"O thread of time".

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,940
Like "O time!
Suspend your flight".

32
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,776
It's wrong.
Don't argue.

33
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:20,882
Anyway, this dictation is stupid.

34
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,975
What?

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,499
"The butcher makes pate..."

36
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,619
They're really shitty sentences.

37
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,900
Please, Laurent...

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,175
I don't need your opinions...

39
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:39,038
And I don't like you
saying bad words.

40
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:41,220
- Alright?
- Alright.

41
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,284
We'll go over it.

42
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,901
"The butcher was making pate."

43
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
You spelled pate with an extra E.

44
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,862
- Sure I did.
- But that's wrong!

45
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,800
You told me before
that it has an E.

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,300
Me? I told you there was
an extra E in pate?

47
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,604
Yes, last Thursday.

48
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,627
You're just being cheeky now.

49
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,854
You're forcing me
to make mistakes.

50
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:07,380
That was "LA patée du chien".

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,791
La patée du chien...
Dog mince!

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,820
In that case,
there's an E on the end!

53
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,369
So, when the butcher is making pate,

54
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,947
there is no "e".

55
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:20,541
But if the dog eats it,
it gets another E. Crazy.

56
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:22,103
That's how it is!

57
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,820
And now to finish...
the cultural outing.

58
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,340
We have Abel Gance's film, "Napoleon".

59
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,700
A masterpiece, that shows us
a very fiery Bonaparte.

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,577
6 francs, with metro ride.

61
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:59,744
Or, more classic,
a visit to Malmaison...

62
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,900
12 francs...

63
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,740
Coach and sandwiches included.

64
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,367
So all we need do now,
is to vote.

65
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,060
For the film to discuss,
raise your hand.

66
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,780
1, 2, 3, 4,

67
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,980
5, 6,

68
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,020
7, 8.

69
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
8.

70
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,507
We'll discuss the film
in the Trocadero gardens.

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,733
The film is shorter
than the visit would be.

72
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:33,400
It's cheaper because
of the distance.

73
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,150
Any questions?

74
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:37,245
So, Malmaison?

75
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,900
3,

76
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,580
4, 5, 6,

77
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,420
7, 8, 9, 10,

78
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,860
11, 12.

79
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,980
12...

80
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,217
Well, I see classicism
has won out.

81
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Good evening.

82
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,180
Mr Lanier, I wanted
to congratulate you, about Laurent.

83
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,355
Congratulate me+

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,269
Despite your family situation,
I understand...

85
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:19,004
...you've been able to
keep him balanced, and mentally sound.

86
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,347
My wife and I have split up
without animosity.

87
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:25,887
I know what I'm talking about.
You're a fantastic father.

88
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,902
- "Fantastic"...?
- Yes.

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,121
To bring up a child on your own,
is rare.

90
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,940
Well, it's just a matter
of being organised.

91
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,449
Thank you.
Goodbye.

92
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,135
<i>Leave me the dry-cleaning ticket.
You'll forget tomorrow.</i>

93
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:53,586
3, 4...

94
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,595
5 faults... well done!

95
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:58,545
<i>I bought your cigarettes.</i>

96
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:19,936
<i>There's cold chicken
in the kitchen.</i>

97
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,748
Unbelievable!

98
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:25,936
Unbelievable!
What's going on...?

99
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,833
Damnation!

100
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:39,422
<i>The lights don't work.
I put the stool there to fix the fuses.</i>

101
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:40,563
Thanks.

102
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,422
I hear buzzing.
I hate that.

103
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,438
Capital 'A'...

104
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,340
"Brumaire the 18th."

105
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,020
...m, a, i, r, e.

106
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,860
Small 'a'...
"The origin of the coup."

107
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,820
Small 'b' - The event.

108
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,460
Small 'c' - The consequences
of the coup.

109
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,140
Small 'a' - "The origin..."

110
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:55,928
Pellegrin, can't you restrain
your artistic impulses?

111
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:59,260
- I didn't do it, Ma'am.
- So did I do it?

112
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:02,372
- I'd never draw that, Ma'am.
- Go outside.

113
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:05,060
- It wasn't him, Ma'am.
- What are you on about Lanier?

114
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,136
About the truth, Ma'am.

115
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,128
- Did Berthier call?
- No.

116
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,500
I called all morning.
It was busy.

117
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,558
He doesn't give a damn
about anyone.

118
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:23,644
- Does he know the form-work was frozen?
- Obviously.

119
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,589
He'll call back.

120
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,620
Well, I'll go up and help them.

121
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,084
Hey!

122
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:52,714
Well...

123
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:15,426
So?

124
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:17,761
It'll all need to be re-done.

125
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,619
What do you mean, "all re-done"?

126
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,933
It has to be checked out.

127
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:23,803
It needs to be assessed.

128
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,709
Can you hear me?

129
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,808
You're wanted on the phone.

130
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,060
- What did she say?
- You're wanted on the phone.

131
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,404
I think it's Berthier.

132
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:56,634
Who is it?

133
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,759
It's your son.

134
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,803
That's why you brought me down?

135
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:05,740
He said it was important.

136
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,706
- Laurent?
- Hello... Dad?

137
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,102
You forgot the dry-cleaning ticket.

138
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,180
What?

139
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:20,342
You forgot to leave me
the dry-cleaning ticket.

140
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:24,123
I was to go and pick up
your suit after school.

141
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:26,904
Listen, Laurent...

142
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:28,427
But I can't.

143
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,020
Can't what?

144
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,936
I won't be able to.
Too bad for you.

145
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:33,983
Listen, Laurent, be a good boy..

146
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,647
You won't yell at me
about your waistcoat?

147
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:49,554
Miss Turp is much better
than Carpentier.

148
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:50,829
You've never had her.

149
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,889
Yeah, but you're
still on Napoleon.

150
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,622
We do him in more detail.
Takes more time.

151
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:58,225
Carpentier's a bitch.

152
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,340
Tassard says she's hopeless.

153
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,381
You're kidding...

154
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,195
He made 100 mistakes in his dictation.

155
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:07,992
- That true, Tassard?
- Tassard, he says you're crap.

156
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,490
If there's no answer,
we'll go round the side.

157
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,193
Come on.

158
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:06,774
Hello, ma'am.

159
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:08,271
Hello, children.

160
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,420
It's soil from the country.

161
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:14,740
We got it last weekend.

162
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:19,365
If you have pot-plants,
you should change the soil.

163
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,880
- It's 5 francs.
- Yes, but...

164
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:24,318
How often have you changed it?

165
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,474
- I don't know.
- That's bad.

166
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:28,669
You'll be infected by bugs.

167
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,294
Plants like fresh soil
that breathes.

168
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:33,860
It's only 5 francs.

169
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:35,380
We won't make a mess.

170
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,245
- Finished?
- Yes.

171
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,420
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- Goodbye, boys.

172
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,285
- Hello, Ma'am.

173
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:42,902
It's soil from the country.
We got it last weekend.

174
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,784
If you have pot-plants...

175
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
...you should change the soil.

176
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,405
It's only 5 francs.

177
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,740
How long is it
since you changed it?

178
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
That's bad.

179
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,707
You'll get bugs.

180
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,339
Plants love fresh soil that breathes.

181
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:02,418
- It's only 5 francs.
- We won't make a mess.

182
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,953
<i>Good evening.
Hotel Westminster.</i>

183
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:53,144
Hello. Possible to speak
with Miss Garcin?

184
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:55,540
<i>Just a minute.</i>

185
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,742
<i>I'm afraid Miss Garcin
is not here.</i>

186
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:06,344
She don't left a message
for Mr Lanier?

187
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,277
No message. Sorry.

188
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:11,511
Thank you.

189
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,285
You're welcome, Sir.

190
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,082
-"You're welcome, Sir."

191
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,008
Something wrong?

192
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:32,172
Everything's fine.

193
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,235
Fancy a movie?

194
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,696
Now?
I've already been this afternoon.

195
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,336
So what?

196
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,337
I won't get to bed till late.
I start at 8.30 in the morning.

197
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,117
You act like an old man.

198
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:50,235
Well, if it will make you happy...

199
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,474
Yes... yes.

200
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:01,940
No... that can take 2 days.

201
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:05,372
We can't start the plumbing during...

202
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:08,957
April 17?

203
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:17,594
Catching up in winter
is difficult, you realise.

204
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:20,711
Yes, I realise how upsetting
it must be.

205
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:23,707
Very well then...

206
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:26,060
I'll report back in a fortnight.

207
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,004
That OK?
Fine, that's what we'll do.

208
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,137
[Ingredients for rabbit dish]

209
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:32,769
Call me on the 15th.

210
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,481
I'm going to the supermarket.

211
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,475
You got the good plates out?

212
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,291
A special dinner.

213
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,322
- The rabbit fricassee?
- Yes.

214
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,242
Done your homework?

215
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,149
- Yeah, yeah.
-"Yeah, yeah."

216
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,657
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I've done it.

217
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,912
This is how you
mop up the sauce.

218
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,497
I'm still hungry.

219
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:10,244
"Still hungry!"

220
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,857
It was really yummy.

221
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:16,752
Rabbit's my specialty.

222
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:20,885
That's all you can do,
but you do it well.

223
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,069
Thank you Sir.

224
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:25,028
Well...

225
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,814
Now then...

226
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:31,018
You want Liege coffee
or Vanoise?

227
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,041
- Vanoise.
- Alright.

228
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,518
That's good.
Then I get what I like.

229
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:41,243
Have you really finished
your homework?

230
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,348
Yeah.

231
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,728
"Yeah"...

232
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,853
I only say "yeah".

233
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,820
Where's your exercise book?

234
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,447
On the table
in my room.

235
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:04,897
4 remains...
carry 3....

236
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:07,537
7 and 3 is 10.

237
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,697
Take away 3... point...

238
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:13,816
2 x 5 is 10.

239
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,748
3...

240
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:19,331
2 x 5...

241
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:23,176
5... 9.

242
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:27,096
9 x 5 is 45.
46, 47, 48, 49, 50...

243
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,456
0, and I carry 4...

244
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:32,831
9 x 5...
9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

245
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:34,276
There we are.

246
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,947
Divisions are hard
with the decimals.

247
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,494
You haven't made any mistakes.
That's good..

248
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,034
You don't have
a very clear conscience.

249
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:48,838
- Me?
- Yes.

250
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,455
Laurent, don't laugh.
Where is it?

251
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,518
I understand.
Go and get it.

252
00:20:56,543 --> 00:20:57,431
What?

253
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,182
Go and get it...!
You think I don't know?

254
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,299
And do you think
you're making progress?

255
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:16,932
You also use it.

256
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:21,886
But you know that
I can do divisions.

257
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,056
I use it to save time.

258
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,330
Me too... to save time.
Mine's just as valuable.

259
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,213
Go to bed!

260
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:33,018
- You're in my room.
- So what? Go to bed!

261
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:35,834
Confiscated.

262
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,573
Aren't you saying goodnight, Dad?

263
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,090
What's this thing?

264
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:02,739
It's memory
for polar coordinates.

265
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,656
Why don't I have it on mine?

266
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,387
I don't like when you yell at me.

267
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,645
You're nuts...

268
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:18,239
I'm not yelling at you.

269
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:22,020
I'm just a bit tired.

270
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,378
But all the same, we can
have a little match if you like.

271
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:30,489
- Now? - OK? - Sure!

272
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,416
Come on...
we'll set up.

273
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:38,262
Be careful of the TV.

274
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:40,296
Let's go!

275
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:55,191
A professional match
of 15 rounds...

276
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:59,177
...competing for the world
mosquito-weight title.

277
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,936
Between the title-holder,
Franck Lanier...

278
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,776
and his challenger...

279
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,136
the little Laurent Lanier.

280
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:09,096
Laurent Lanier,

281
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,056
26,850 kg,

282
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,336
Franck Lanier, 71,500 kg.

283
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:15,497
Allow me to present...

284
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,495
Laurent Lanier!

285
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:19,678
And Franck Lanier!

286
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:36,378
Dong!

287
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:13,249
Dong!

288
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:18,056
Go to your corner.

289
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,245
Already?

290
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:23,715
- Yes. 5 minutes rest.
- It didn't last long.

291
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,113
3 minutes...
with head-butts...

292
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:29,016
You know...

293
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,176
It's not fair
that you're the referee.

294
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:35,043
We only resume
when it suits you.

295
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:38,348
When you're in trouble,
you make the round shorter!

296
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,254
Dong!

297
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:07,896
1, 2, 3,

298
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,096
4, 5,

299
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:11,951
6...

300
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:20,490
Hello?

301
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:22,287
No, I'm not leaving.

302
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:26,272
Oh, it's you?

303
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,052
You're in Paris?

304
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,928
You'll be there
in half an hour?

305
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:53,123
Dad?

306
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,772
Who was that?

307
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:03,568
On the phone.

308
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:08,428
No one special.
Just about work.

309
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:12,616
Brushed your teeth?

310
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:17,643
We had a super evening, eh?

311
00:26:18,302 --> 00:26:19,354
Sure, yeah.

312
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,572
You hurt me.

313
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:26,752
Sleep tight, world champ.

314
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:28,799
We both had a great time.

315
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,354
Of course we did.

316
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:35,197
Come on... off to sleep.

317
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,479
Hey, the door!

318
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,028
What about it?

319
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,543
Leave it open.

320
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:45,296
Sorry.

321
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,128
- Like this?
- Yes. Thanks.

322
00:27:42,856 --> 00:27:44,081
Have you missed me?

323
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:48,323
- Finished with your travels?
- Yes.

324
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:00,026
Look...

325
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:03,056
It's cute.

326
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:08,440
Terrific, eh?

327
00:28:09,198 --> 00:28:10,651
I found them in Glasgow.

328
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:37,296
Quiet!

329
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,376
Miss Carpentier is here.

330
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,479
Tassard, you watch the class.

331
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:52,376
No noise!

332
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:54,273
I'll be listening.

333
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:15,453
Hey, you haven't paid.
5 francs.

334
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:17,372
Here.

335
00:29:43,604 --> 00:29:45,247
Are we practicing, Tassard?

336
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:49,003
- Dad!
- Here.

337
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:52,154
Look at this.

338
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:55,834
- What?
- You have to buy another pair.

339
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:58,717
- With what money?
- Yours.

340
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:03,693
It's not a scooter.

341
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,412
It says age 10.
Go try them on.

342
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,325
Hey, how are they?

343
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,271
Pardon me.

344
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:24,349
Hurry up, Laurent.

345
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,256
We could've fixed the others.
It would've cost less.

346
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,498
Considering my talents
as a seamstress...

347
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:39,185
Laurent, are you coming?
We're going to be late.

348
00:30:39,736 --> 00:30:41,816
I'm coming!

349
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:46,771
- What's this?
- It's for Grandma's turtles.

350
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,857
For the turtles?
You sure have a lot there!

351
00:30:51,736 --> 00:30:53,830
They're not going
to eat all that.

352
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:55,310
There are 2 of them.

353
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:57,279
Oh, there's 2, yes.

354
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:00,881
I was thinking of leaving you
with Grandma today.

355
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:02,618
And then...

356
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:05,400
You'll do what?

357
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:07,351
I'll pick you up this evening.

358
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:12,795
I wanted the chance to take a walk
in the countryside with a lady friend.

359
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:17,776
Who is she?

360
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:20,576
Oh, you'll see.
She's a very old friend.

361
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:24,029
A girl I knew at university.

362
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:28,232
Funny I should run into her
as I was leaving the work site.

363
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:32,146
Pure chance.

364
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:36,349
We decided...
You don't mind, do you?

365
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,623
That's OK.

366
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:50,701
- There's a cop over there.
- Where?

367
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,756
There.

368
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:56,264
If he shows up,
tell him I'm coming.

369
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:57,477
Okay.

370
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:21,123
Liar!

371
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:23,530
"Funny I should run into her..."

372
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:30,425
- Is the driver your father?
- Yeah.

373
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:33,096
Go and tell him
he can't park here.

374
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:34,776
He's with a woman.

375
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:36,096
What?

376
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:38,451
He doesn't care
about parking tickets.

377
00:32:39,314 --> 00:32:41,223
He tears them up anyway.

378
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:52,679
He's alright about
staying on his own.

379
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,764
We'll drop him off
with his grandmother.

380
00:32:55,816 --> 00:32:57,625
You're not worried
he'll make a fuss about it?

381
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,691
Not at all.

382
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:08,590
- Here you are?
- For me?

383
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,504
Why?

384
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,428
I don't want to go to Grandma's.

385
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,593
What did you say?

386
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:33,936
I don't want to go to Grandma's.

387
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:38,880
A little while ago you said
you wanted to go.

388
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:41,376
I've changed my mind.

389
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:44,489
You said you were going to Grandma's.
You're going to Grandma's.

390
00:33:47,136 --> 00:33:50,497
Mum said you were dressed
like an old man.

391
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,091
I need to pee.

392
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:04,622
Can't you hang on?

393
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:08,559
He's decided to screw up our day.

394
00:34:09,056 --> 00:34:10,489
He can have a pee.

395
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,856
My intrusion isn't going so well.

396
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:27,153
Let him come with us...
for my sake.

397
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:29,747
No... I mustn't give in.

398
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,769
Franck, I'm getting to know him.

399
00:34:31,794 --> 00:34:34,052
I want this day
to be a success.

400
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:36,099
Let's go to the seaside.

401
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,096
The sea? You're joking.
It's 200 km.

402
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,442
Well...

403
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:44,786
We'll have to fill up...

404
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:47,766
You like the seaside?

405
00:34:48,138 --> 00:34:49,403
Yeah, it's not bad.

406
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,802
You'd better, because we're going.

407
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:53,085
Yeah!

408
00:34:58,405 --> 00:35:00,161
My first is a first-name.

409
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:02,419
My second is a name.

410
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:05,966
Making an actor.

411
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:11,520
Who is it?

412
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:16,786
- Jean-Paul Belmondo.
- Wrong.

413
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,641
Humphrey Bogart.

414
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,817
Do you have many others
like that?

415
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,720
Thousands.

416
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:25,339
Want to hear another one?

417
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,296
No thanks, I'd rather
get some fresh air.

418
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:05,176
This is not the Olympics,
for heaven's sake!

419
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:09,514
It's stupid we don't have a ball.
We could've played a game.

420
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:12,967
- You just have to buy one.
- You've got 10 balls at home.

421
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,571
Go on!
Buy one!

422
00:36:14,787 --> 00:36:17,690
We buy one
every time we go out.

423
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,021
Go on, Dad!

424
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:24,217
Alright, but it counts
towards your birthday.

425
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,303
Which one?
10th or 11th?

426
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:28,584
- Which do you prefer?
- 10th.

427
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,248
He's not stupid, you know.
He's 10½ now.

428
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:33,797
Really...

429
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:35,615
How do you feel
about eating oysters?

430
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,470
My first is numeral "Un".

431
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,267
My second is... "frais".

432
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:10,015
My third is...

433
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:12,169
..."beau".

434
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:15,353
My fourth is a "gare".

435
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,744
All making a film actor.

436
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,895
A...lain Delon.

437
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:22,579
No!

438
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,509
Has the cat got your tongue?

439
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:26,838
Yeah..

440
00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:29,142
Humphrey Bogart.

441
00:37:32,055 --> 00:37:34,530
Un, frais, Beau, gare.

442
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:39,695
It's the iodine...
It increases his brain activity tenfold.

443
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:42,976
Doesn't stop her laughing madly.

444
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:54,968
"Come along."

445
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:58,112
"Quietly, this time."

446
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:02,397
"Pass me the suitcase.
We'll stash the dough in it."

447
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:05,375
"The dough!"

448
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,310
I could do with a short nap.

449
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:14,162
On the beach
or in the car?

450
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,061
On the beach.

451
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:21,264
The sand, the sun,
your toes spread out.

452
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,795
You know there are bedrooms
with central heating.

453
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,889
The sea tends to give me ideas.

454
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,186
Really?
What sort of ideas?

455
00:38:35,281 --> 00:38:36,661
Wonderful.

456
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:38,693
It's the iodine.

457
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:41,695
It increases your
brain activity tenfold.

458
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,522
Like me to show you my idea?

459
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:46,998
Don't want me
to show you my idea?

460
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,433
Yes.

461
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:50,381
Laurent?

462
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:53,404
Can't he stay playing
on the beach?

463
00:38:56,553 --> 00:38:58,633
Shouldn't be a problem.

464
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,522
It feels nice,
taking you to the seaside.

465
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:15,694
Did you see that, Dad?

466
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,478
The horses?
Yeah.

467
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:19,822
Do you think we could have a ride?

468
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,415
Sure!
Janine is a bit tired.

469
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:25,935
You could have 2, 3 rides.

470
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:34,895
Laurent wants to go horse-riding
on the beach.

471
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,947
He wants to do it on his own.

472
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:38,978
The horses down there?

473
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,528
Yes. Do you want to come?

474
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:42,490
Why not?

475
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,119
Well, let's get going!

476
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,353
Good... let's go.

477
00:39:47,698 --> 00:39:49,258
It'll be fun, eh?

478
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:08,371
You know what
he said to me just now?

479
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,598
"You wouldn't think so,
but she's very nice."

480
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,812
You don't put on airs...
but you're very pretty.

481
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:25,601
Have you thought about Bangkok?

482
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:27,549
Are you going to be able
to get away?

483
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:29,156
I'm sick of being the sucker!

484
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:34,413
I'm always the one who cops it.

485
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,859
You're all going on a trip,
and I have to stay.

486
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,044
You don't like going on trips.

487
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:44,630
Bangkok is more than a trip.

488
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:04,293
The lady from Bangkok.

489
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,418
Are you going to tell him
you're going with me?

490
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:28,316
I don't know...
We'll see later.

491
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,695
- Is he your gangster?
- What?

492
00:41:43,855 --> 00:41:45,335
Doesn't look like one.

493
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:48,215
The garage is a hideout.

494
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:53,839
You want to spend your life
carrying bags of soil around?

495
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:56,626
With his trick, you can make
at least 30 francs.

496
00:41:57,575 --> 00:41:59,975
Don't let me down...
I have the tokens.

497
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:03,181
OK. But we need to make
at least 30 francs each.

498
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:05,564
- I'll go and get it.
- Alright.

499
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:15,345
What are you doing here?

500
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,868
Laurent wants 30 francs each.

501
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:20,523
I've told you 100 times
already not to come here.

502
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,992
He's not the boss.

503
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:27,046
A 5.58pm, you go
to the record section.

504
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:29,382
You casually collect
a bunch of records.

505
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:31,554
Each of you a separate bunch.

506
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:35,023
- In the pop section?
- Yeah... pop that's in English.

507
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:37,735
- All clear?
- Yeah.

508
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:41,139
At 6pm I come in
and attract attention.

509
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,952
You grab the discs
and scram.

510
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,054
We'll meet up
at the garage.

511
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:50,546
- How will you attract attention?
- Never mind.

512
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,039
Let's set our watches.

513
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,850
Are you looking for something?

514
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,484
No... nothing...

515
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:04,225
You going to work in jeans?

516
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:06,703
I'm meeting your mother.

517
00:44:08,466 --> 00:44:11,422
She's always telling me
how I dress like an old man...

518
00:44:11,772 --> 00:44:14,612
Shit, I forgot my exercise book.

519
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:17,604
- See you this evening.
- See you!

520
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:41,430
<i>2 return tickets to Bangkok</i>

521
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:44,320
Cut the noise!

522
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,031
I found two tickets.
He wanted to surprise me.

523
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,090
He's going to say to me...

524
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:53,375
"Pack your bag, we're
going to Bangkok."

525
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,242
I know what he's like.

526
00:44:55,455 --> 00:44:59,855
Two sets are equal if,
and only if...

527
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:02,250
Where's Bangkok?

528
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,492
I don't know.
To the right, in Asia...

529
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,840
You just have to look
in the dictionary.

530
00:45:07,055 --> 00:45:08,953
Pass me the dictionary.

531
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,531
Pass me the dictionary.

532
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:13,173
The dictionary.

533
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,453
The rule is as follows...

534
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:23,615
When more than one set
is involved...

535
00:45:24,695 --> 00:45:27,289
A or B...

536
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:30,828
A equals B...

537
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,335
or B equals   A

538
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:35,695
signifying that...

539
00:45:35,895 --> 00:45:38,015
A and B...

540
00:45:39,215 --> 00:45:42,524
...designate one
and the same set.

541
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:45,255
"Bangkok, capital of Thailand."

542
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,855
It's on the right,
down the bottom.

543
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:51,535
"Cement works, shipyards,
food factories..."

544
00:45:52,895 --> 00:45:55,695
Sounds like Bangkok
is like Aubervilliers.

545
00:45:55,895 --> 00:45:58,438
There are no shipyards
in Aubervilliers.

546
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,855
What are you
talking about?

547
00:46:00,531 --> 00:46:02,867
That there are no shipyards
in Aubervilliers.

548
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:38,045
<i>We don't give brochures
to schoolchildren</i>

549
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:49,295
What a nice surprise.
What's her name? Corinne?

550
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:51,576
No... Janine.

551
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,475
Oh yeah.
When are you leaving?

552
00:46:57,855 --> 00:46:59,983
- You haven't told anyone?
- No.

553
00:47:00,815 --> 00:47:03,022
- It's not true.
- No, I swear.

554
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,015
You'll never change, eh?

555
00:47:05,175 --> 00:47:06,319
What do you mean?

556
00:47:06,815 --> 00:47:08,362
It's true you're secretive.

557
00:47:08,386 --> 00:47:10,170
Now my son gets into it!

558
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:11,775
Give me a break, you two!

559
00:47:11,974 --> 00:47:14,869
The other day you
shook hands with Janine,

560
00:47:14,894 --> 00:47:17,092
as if I didn't know
you kiss each other.

561
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:19,561
Modesty...

562
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:22,451
You won't even tell me
where we're going on holiday.

563
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:25,389
You going to Courchevel
with your mother.

564
00:47:26,225 --> 00:47:28,490
You'll see... He'll keep it
right till the end.

565
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:33,545
I found the tickets
for Bangkok, you see.

566
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:45,415
-1, 2, 3, 4.

567
00:47:45,575 --> 00:47:48,935
1, 2, 3, 4.
We open up the lungs.

568
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:50,873
Tassard doesn't have his outfit?

569
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:54,061
Come and see me at
the end of the session, Tassard.

570
00:47:54,449 --> 00:47:55,592
3, 4...

571
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:58,053
On tire. 3, 4... 1, 2...

572
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,670
There's Dede who wants to see us
in the garage at 6 o'clock.

573
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:04,358
He wants to talk about
a great new hit.

574
00:48:04,529 --> 00:48:06,459
- Not interested.
- What's up?

575
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:08,459
I'm just not interested.

576
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,070
...has its source
on Mt Gerbier-de-Jonc...

577
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:14,506
1,307 metres high.

578
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:17,015
Do you have photos
of Bangkok?

579
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:18,108
Shit.

580
00:48:18,256 --> 00:48:21,514
I investigated.
There are elephants.

581
00:48:22,495 --> 00:48:24,695
- You're lucky.
- You're pissing me off.

582
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:27,457
Who was using bad language?

583
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:37,011
I'm waiting.

584
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:41,666
It was me, Ma'am.

585
00:48:42,535 --> 00:48:44,015
What was it about?

586
00:48:57,055 --> 00:48:58,455
- Good evening.
- Miss.

587
00:48:58,655 --> 00:49:02,160
Sorry to disturb you.
It's about Laurent.

588
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:05,015
Really?
Come in.

589
00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:14,135
I'm worried,
Mr Lanier.

590
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:17,714
Laurent is not interested anymore.
He's regressing day by day.

591
00:49:21,886 --> 00:49:24,095
Well... give me your coat.

592
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:25,980
Certainly.

593
00:49:35,535 --> 00:49:37,655
He's becoming downright
insufferable.

594
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,535
Isn't that wonderful!

595
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:44,295
You have wonderful taste.

596
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:49,358
So I did a little investigating.
May I sit down?

597
00:49:50,255 --> 00:49:51,593
Of course...

598
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:55,718
I put some questions
to Laurent.

599
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:59,921
It turns out that he's traumatized
by your trip to Bangkok.

600
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:02,615
Really?

601
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:04,735
With Janine.

602
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:08,895
Because...

603
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:12,995
It started the day you
received the call from the airport

604
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:15,046
and when you kissed Janine.

605
00:50:17,257 --> 00:50:19,296
Children feel rejected.

606
00:50:21,866 --> 00:50:24,093
They are also
quite talkative.

607
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:26,811
Aren't you going to
offer me a drink?

608
00:50:27,335 --> 00:50:30,811
Yes, what would you
like to drink?

609
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:35,022
A whisky with lots of water.
I wouldn't want to get drunk.

610
00:50:44,733 --> 00:50:47,405
This morning,
I'm making breakfast.

611
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:50,085
- Cocoa and French toast.
- You're burning the toast.

612
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,015
Not serious.

613
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:53,815
There we go.

614
00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:04,249
About Bangkok,
if I'm not taking you...

615
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:06,015
...it's really not my fault.

616
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:08,815
You want to be alone
with Janine.

617
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:12,647
Don't be silly...
You don't understand...

618
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,179
It's all about money.

619
00:51:16,622 --> 00:51:20,107
4,000 francs. I don't have enough
to take you to Bangkok.

620
00:51:20,149 --> 00:51:21,230
You must realise that.

621
00:51:21,255 --> 00:51:25,015
- Otherwise you'd take me?
- Yes, of course.

622
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,763
Who's paying for Janine?
You?

623
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,411
What? For her ticket?

624
00:51:29,575 --> 00:51:30,599
Yeah.

625
00:51:32,177 --> 00:51:34,415
She is, of course.
Not me.

626
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:37,239
There's cement in Bangkok.

627
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,661
How much will it make?

628
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:48,630
Lots.

629
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:50,810
At least 4,350?

630
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:54,138
5 times that.
The tote takings, understand?

631
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:57,028
What is the tote?

632
00:51:57,455 --> 00:52:00,177
The betting shop.
You'll pinch the takings?

633
00:52:00,302 --> 00:52:02,615
The one at the Cafe Goulart,
on Michelet St.

634
00:52:03,763 --> 00:52:06,138
- You're talking about a heist?
- So what?

635
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,550
It's not serious.
Your mum's gonna make you rinse.

636
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:15,924
I like cordial better.

637
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,026
We can buy some.

638
00:52:21,062 --> 00:52:22,734
Were you in time
for the doctor?

639
00:52:23,455 --> 00:52:25,063
So what did he say?

640
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:28,295
Angina?
What do you mean, angina?

641
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:31,056
Hold the line.

642
00:52:33,055 --> 00:52:34,820
So is it serious or not?

643
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:38,266
Where did he get hold of it?

644
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:41,055
Hold the line...
It's Janine.

645
00:52:43,695 --> 00:52:45,938
Alright... please...

646
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:49,727
Can you stay
to make him his dinner?

647
00:52:50,175 --> 00:52:53,855
I'm sorry to have to ask you.
Very kind of you.

648
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:56,975
Well, you take care of it.
Love you. Goodbye.

649
00:52:57,135 --> 00:52:58,617
I'll put him on.

650
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:07,215
You OK?

651
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:10,095
He has angina.

652
00:53:16,935 --> 00:53:18,655
- Is this what you're reading?
- Yeah.

653
00:53:18,815 --> 00:53:20,719
But that'll give you nightmares.

654
00:53:22,175 --> 00:53:24,711
I swapped it with Gilles,
for 2 "Asterix" comics.

655
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,375
- Who's Gilles?
- My best friend.

656
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,055
- "Your best friend"?
- Yes.

657
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,335
I had an even better one,
before we moved.

658
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,215
Laurent! See who's at the door?

659
00:53:54,415 --> 00:53:55,415
Hello.

660
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:00,613
Who was it?

661
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,945
She's a bum.
She sells potatoes door-to-door.

662
00:54:07,935 --> 00:54:09,895
I told her to get lost.

663
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:12,055
Open the door!

664
00:54:13,895 --> 00:54:15,415
Ignore her, Mum.

665
00:54:22,015 --> 00:54:23,575
You sell potatoes?

666
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:24,775
Sorry?

667
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:30,175
I find it hard to believe.

668
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:34,535
"A bum"?
You called her a bum?

669
00:54:34,695 --> 00:54:37,895
- Yes, I was very cool about it.
- Cheeky, you mean.

670
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:40,455
If you call that
being cool.

671
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,895
How long, for
the potato gratin?

672
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:47,015
95 minutes.
Set the thermostat at 4.

673
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:52,335
Hello? Who do you want?

674
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:57,035
It's Janine.
She's calling from work.

675
00:54:57,555 --> 00:54:59,095
I think she's crying.

676
00:55:09,855 --> 00:55:11,495
Hi, Franck.
How are things?

677
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,039
Fine thanks.

678
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,455
Well, I'll leave you to it.

679
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:20,815
See you.

680
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:28,575
Everything must be wrapped up
by Christmas. It's hell.

681
00:55:29,415 --> 00:55:32,295
So tell me, what's wrong, eh?

682
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:33,295
Nothing.

683
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:37,193
Is it the potato story,
that's brought this on?

684
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,695
I don't give a stuff about that.
It's all about your ego.

685
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:40,966
My ego?

686
00:55:41,044 --> 00:55:43,825
I'm sick of you hiding me.
It's gone on too long.

687
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:47,919
I'd come to spend the afternoon
with Laurent.

688
00:55:48,575 --> 00:55:51,122
And I find myself
in a clownish situation.

689
00:55:51,535 --> 00:55:53,495
It's because of the divorce.

690
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:56,482
My lawyer says
I have to be sensible.

691
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:59,935
Stop it! Anyone would think
you were at war with Sylviane.

692
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:03,310
Your kid's not going
to get stolen from you.

693
00:56:13,043 --> 00:56:15,372
This is for Laurent.
It's a Meccano set.

694
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:23,415
Can I come up for 5 minutes?

695
00:56:25,655 --> 00:56:26,655
On Sunday.

696
00:56:28,495 --> 00:56:31,075
Pick me up around 3pm
at the printery.

697
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:52,604
What's the matter?

698
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:54,545
Dracula comes out
from under the bed.

699
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:00,779
Look.

700
00:57:02,095 --> 00:57:03,147
So?

701
00:57:03,775 --> 00:57:05,694
You can see no one's there.

702
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,735
You're hot.

703
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:10,095
Go back to sleep.

704
00:57:13,622 --> 00:57:15,262
Who's told you about Dracula?

705
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:17,335
Nobody.
He's in the lounge-room.

706
00:57:18,495 --> 00:57:19,575
You'll see.

707
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:23,834
He's behind the books.

708
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:35,339
There's no one.

709
00:57:35,363 --> 00:57:37,741
Behind the German dictionary.

710
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:39,131
Mum put him there.

711
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:55,421
What are these horrors?

712
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:57,734
Can I sleep in your bed?

713
00:58:02,421 --> 00:58:03,945
Who gave you this?

714
00:58:04,135 --> 00:58:06,687
I swapped it with Gilles
for 2 "Asterix" comics.

715
00:58:10,775 --> 00:58:12,554
Come on.

716
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:30,135
Dad...?

717
00:58:31,615 --> 00:58:32,615
What now?

718
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:34,632
Did you hear a noise?

719
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:41,855
Go to sleep, Laurent.

720
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:47,468
I can't sleep.

721
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,617
Count sheep.

722
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:51,055
That's dumb.

723
00:58:53,735 --> 00:58:54,781
We could play poker?

724
00:58:55,593 --> 00:58:57,773
Don't be silly...
We're going to sleep.

725
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:19,828
Give me two.

726
00:59:21,735 --> 00:59:22,735
Plus 2.

727
00:59:25,535 --> 00:59:26,615
Pair of queens.

728
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:29,815
Three kings!

729
00:59:32,495 --> 00:59:33,895
Good... you've won.

730
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:42,295
-6, 8, 10.

731
00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:50,415
Cut.

732
00:59:55,935 --> 00:59:56,935
Tell me, Dad...

733
00:59:57,095 --> 01:00:00,194
...if I had those 4,300 francs,
will you take me to Bangkok?

734
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:04,007
- 2.
- I'm in.

735
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:10,215
- How many cards?
- 3.

736
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:13,895
2 to me.

737
01:00:16,015 --> 01:00:17,735
We're going to do a heist.

738
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,055
Yeah?

739
01:00:20,255 --> 01:00:22,055
The tote.

740
01:00:22,815 --> 01:00:26,015
You'd be justified.
It's dirty money.

741
01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:29,303
Either way, there are people
who ruin themselves on the trifecta.

742
01:00:30,135 --> 01:00:31,415
Don't you feel sorry for them?

743
01:00:31,655 --> 01:00:34,895
Not at all.
It's your turn.

744
01:00:35,655 --> 01:00:37,295
Your call.
I'm all in.

745
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:41,335
- What have you got?
- Nothing at all.

746
01:00:42,463 --> 01:00:45,543
I'm sorry, pal,
full house, kings and tens.

747
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,695
You win.

748
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:48,420
- Yes?
- Marlboro.

749
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:15,735
If it starts like this,
let's stop here and now.

750
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,358
Second window on the right
with the flowers.

751
01:01:23,655 --> 01:01:24,646
See it?

752
01:01:24,686 --> 01:01:27,015
- Of course.
- You can do it?

753
01:01:27,215 --> 01:01:31,178
We already smashed the windshield
of Carpentier's car.

754
01:01:56,815 --> 01:01:58,053
It's not an Olympics time.

755
01:01:58,109 --> 01:01:59,075
Show me.

756
01:01:59,135 --> 01:02:01,912
1 minute 40.
We need to cut at least 10 seconds off.

757
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:05,942
- Shall we do the voice shot?
- I'm out of breath.

758
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:08,209
Will you be out of breath
on the day of the heist?

759
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,135
I will have practiced.

760
01:02:11,335 --> 01:02:13,858
How do you do that?
Show me again.

761
01:02:14,055 --> 01:02:17,022
Show you what again?
What do you want?

762
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:25,305
It's for tomorrow.

763
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:39,563
"National Defense Committee
against tuberculosis."

764
01:02:46,575 --> 01:02:47,555
<i>Good morning.</i>

765
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:48,855
<i>Good morning, Marie.</i>

766
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,335
<i>Here's another trifecta
that's difficult to decipher.</i>

767
01:02:52,495 --> 01:02:55,575
<i>But with these handicaps,
it's became the norm.</i>

768
01:02:55,735 --> 01:02:58,335
<i>These handicaps are given
to young horses...</i>

769
01:02:58,495 --> 01:03:02,655
<i>or today, with the price of 'Plaisance',
to the elderly.</i>

770
01:03:02,815 --> 01:03:06,663
<i>There will be 22 starters,
2,200 metres to cover.</i>

771
01:03:06,688 --> 01:03:08,415
Hello, Gilles?

772
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:10,360
- It's starting badly.
<i>Why?</i>

773
01:03:10,975 --> 01:03:13,855
- It's stamps of '56.
<i>- What year?</i>

774
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:15,855
1956.

775
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:17,688
We can't go back now.

776
01:03:17,887 --> 01:03:20,321
Will we be finished
with the heist by noon?

777
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:23,625
I have to be at my mother's
by 12.30.

778
01:04:53,175 --> 01:04:54,175
Good morning, Ma'am.

779
01:04:54,335 --> 01:04:56,655
It's for the anti-tuberculosis campaign.

780
01:04:56,815 --> 01:04:58,454
Do you want stamps?

781
01:05:05,805 --> 01:05:06,805
-Shit!

782
01:05:06,855 --> 01:05:08,743
They were talking about it on TV.

783
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:11,615
I've seen nothing about it.

784
01:05:11,815 --> 01:05:15,430
On the TV... for research...
It's for doing good.

785
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:17,680
It's for saunas.

786
01:05:17,907 --> 01:05:19,455
- For what?
- Saunas.

787
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,615
"Saunas"?!

788
01:05:21,204 --> 01:05:22,855
You mean sanatoriums don't you?

789
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:26,415
Show me your stamps.

790
01:05:28,135 --> 01:05:30,907
- They're not for this year.
- What?

791
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,083
Look!

792
01:05:53,134 --> 01:05:55,158
Mrs Goulart!
Mrs Goulart!

793
01:05:55,223 --> 01:05:57,705
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

794
01:05:57,847 --> 01:05:59,665
The same thing happened to me.

795
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:05,375
You still here?

796
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:06,815
Where are my stamps?

797
01:06:07,251 --> 01:06:09,902
What stamps?
Yes, here you are.

798
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:12,869
I sell stamps for a living.
I don't buy them.

799
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:52,615
- Here.
- Thank you.

800
01:07:31,655 --> 01:07:33,295
What have you broken?

801
01:07:33,495 --> 01:07:35,470
- Nothing.
- What's that then?

802
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:37,705
It broke all on its own.

803
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:41,582
- What can I do about it?
- What can I?

804
01:07:41,663 --> 01:07:43,143
It's not my fault.

805
01:07:43,405 --> 01:07:46,827
It's nothing to yell at me about.
I'm fed up.

806
01:07:57,495 --> 01:08:00,069
I told you I wasn't OK about it!

807
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:02,326
He just had to work,
to get started.

808
01:08:04,296 --> 01:08:06,350
He tells me he can't find a job.

809
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,739
So I said "Spend less time at the cafe
and more at the job centre."

810
01:08:20,935 --> 01:08:25,353
He said to me... "If I'm at the cafe,
it's because I'm unemployed."

811
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:29,416
I said... "The hospitals
are full of unemployed."

812
01:08:30,175 --> 01:08:31,275
I tell you!

813
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:34,775
- Marcel...!
- Yes?

814
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:39,908
- Shall I put the roast on?
- Yes, that'd be the right time.

815
01:08:40,892 --> 01:08:43,095
Got to run..
Got to feed him.

816
01:08:43,223 --> 01:08:45,023
Talk to you Sunday.

817
01:08:58,464 --> 01:09:00,058
I'll get it.

818
01:09:07,986 --> 01:09:08,975
Mr Goulart?

819
01:09:09,135 --> 01:09:11,242
Owner of the Cafe des Coteaux?

820
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,313
Someone's messing
with your security shutter.

821
01:09:15,227 --> 01:09:17,070
Sounds like burglars.

822
01:09:31,295 --> 01:09:32,775
Shit!

823
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:38,009
What's going on now?

824
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:06,135
What is it?

825
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:10,175
Seems someone was messing
with the shutter.

826
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,290
Got a phone call...

827
01:10:12,455 --> 01:10:13,649
Hi, folks!

828
01:10:33,135 --> 01:10:35,455
Cottage pie...
do you like it?

829
01:10:35,885 --> 01:10:36,885
Sit up.

830
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,191
You don't look
very happy about it.

831
01:10:42,215 --> 01:10:44,350
It's true...
You look sad.

832
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:47,776
I'm tired.
I've had a hard week.

833
01:10:47,948 --> 01:10:49,815
Well, in 10 days
it'll be holidays.

834
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,935
- It'll be fun in Courchevel.
- Yeah.

835
01:10:57,543 --> 01:10:59,104
Hi... how are you?

836
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:00,815
Could you call Janine?

837
01:11:01,022 --> 01:11:03,970
- She didn't come in.
- What?

838
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,041
Did you have
a date with her?

839
01:11:06,686 --> 01:11:08,008
Can I use your phone?

840
01:11:20,198 --> 01:11:21,975
Hello, Mr Lanier.

841
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:24,317
Miss Janine isn't here.

842
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:26,383
She didn't leave a message?

843
01:11:28,258 --> 01:11:29,655
She left a note?

844
01:11:30,344 --> 01:11:32,855
Could you do me a big favour.

845
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,156
Could you please
read it to me?

846
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,867
I can't. It's private.
I'd be terribly embarrassed.

847
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:42,336
You could do it for me,
Mrs Ferral.

848
01:11:42,626 --> 01:11:44,546
It's just to tell me
where she is.

849
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,625
Do me a favour.
Thank you.

850
01:11:55,015 --> 01:11:56,877
I really don't know
if I should.

851
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:00,855
I give you full authorisation.

852
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,290
I have no secrets from you.

853
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:05,975
Alright, I'll read it.

854
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,345
"Darling..."

855
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,408
"Darling!"

856
01:12:10,175 --> 01:12:12,895
I've gone to the country, to reflect.

857
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:15,501
"Partly to clear my mind,
and partly to be alone."

858
01:12:16,228 --> 01:12:18,275
"Don't read too much
into my departure."

859
01:12:18,869 --> 01:12:21,495
"I'm not only happy
with sex..."

860
01:12:22,575 --> 01:12:24,408
<i>"I also want a life with you."</i>

861
01:12:25,935 --> 01:12:27,128
<i>Shall I go on?</i>

862
01:12:27,152 --> 01:12:29,272
No, thank you, Mrs Ferral.

863
01:12:29,895 --> 01:12:33,030
Goodbye.
Sorry to have bothered you.

864
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:01,610
- What's Dede doing?
- I don't know.

865
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,015
What if he doesn't come?

866
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,594
It's your fault, after all.

867
01:13:17,095 --> 01:13:18,875
You're the one
who called Dede.

868
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,535
Think you're smart,
do you?!

869
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,781
So, guys?
Arguing are we?

870
01:13:29,335 --> 01:13:30,535
No, it's OK.

871
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:33,295
We were just talking.

872
01:13:33,961 --> 01:13:36,805
Here, a stick each.
Almost.

873
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:38,977
What's a stick?

874
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,532
You just have to count, man.
See you guys next time.

875
01:14:04,363 --> 01:14:05,695
Do you know what time it is?

876
01:14:06,455 --> 01:14:07,575
Yes.

877
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:19,004
What are you up to?

878
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:20,115
Here.

879
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:26,769
- What is it?
- A stick.

880
01:14:27,948 --> 01:14:29,548
So it's a stick.

881
01:14:30,955 --> 01:14:32,715
You want me to open it?

882
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,355
Where did this money
come from?

883
01:14:41,528 --> 01:14:44,559
- Answer me, Laurent.
- The tote robbery.

884
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:48,067
What are you saying?
Are you kidding?

885
01:14:48,095 --> 01:14:51,455
- No, I'm not kidding.
- Come on, there's a good boy.

886
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:55,137
Tell me about it.
Just between you and me.

887
01:14:55,953 --> 01:14:57,473
Calm down now.

888
01:14:59,615 --> 01:15:03,191
Come on, old chap,
tell me about it.

889
01:15:04,777 --> 01:15:05,895
Tell me about it.

890
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,015
You think it's normal?

891
01:15:12,735 --> 01:15:14,735
A heist at 10 years old
is normal?

892
01:15:14,935 --> 01:15:18,175
You grumble because
we're too hard on you!

893
01:15:19,655 --> 01:15:23,015
If you watched less TV,
it wouldn't happen.

894
01:15:26,575 --> 01:15:29,135
I told you about the heist,
and you didn't believe me.

895
01:15:29,335 --> 01:15:30,535
Rubbish!

896
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:34,575
Your story is a load of nonsense.

897
01:15:34,735 --> 01:15:37,175
It could have been
that Goulart had a safe...

898
01:15:37,335 --> 01:15:42,015
or that his wife closed the door.
Or they weren't downstairs

899
01:15:42,135 --> 01:15:45,335
at his cafe, eh?
Completely crazy.

900
01:15:45,495 --> 01:15:48,775
9 out of 10 chances for it to fail.
It's crazy.

901
01:15:49,186 --> 01:15:51,084
Perhaps. But we succeeded.

902
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:54,015
Laurent, forget
that kind of reasoning.

903
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:16,735
You want me to go in?

904
01:16:42,653 --> 01:16:43,853
Where does Dede live?

905
01:16:46,615 --> 01:16:47,615
This is it?

906
01:16:58,855 --> 01:16:59,855
Yes?

907
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:06,695
- You're Dede?
- Yes. Why?

908
01:17:07,112 --> 01:17:08,620
The tote?

909
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:22,702
You want Gilles' address?

910
01:17:24,026 --> 01:17:25,175
Good idea.

911
01:17:25,335 --> 01:17:28,055
I have to warn you
about his father, though.

912
01:18:38,106 --> 01:18:39,301
There's your father.

913
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:48,015
Come here.

914
01:18:49,575 --> 01:18:52,175
What are you doing
still with that boy?

915
01:18:54,495 --> 01:18:57,968
You're not to see him again.
He's a bad influence on you.

916
01:18:58,255 --> 01:18:59,255
A what?

917
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:02,950
The less you see of each other,
the less you'll get into trouble.

918
01:19:03,053 --> 01:19:04,053
Hurry up.

919
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:07,241
We have to pack
your suitcase.

920
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,343
Your mother's coming at 5.
You little devil!

921
01:19:10,389 --> 01:19:12,749
- I don't care, I won't go.
- What?

922
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,796
Bangkok?
What next?

923
01:19:15,944 --> 01:19:18,655
I won't be rewarding you
for what you did.

924
01:19:18,804 --> 01:19:21,202
Consider yourself lucky
to go to winter sports.

925
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:23,895
I don't know if I'll be going
to Bangkok, now.

926
01:19:25,264 --> 01:19:27,358
I've heard nothing from Janine.

927
01:19:29,759 --> 01:19:30,759
Laurent.

928
01:19:36,747 --> 01:19:37,780
Laurent!

929
01:19:43,633 --> 01:19:44,633
Laurent!

930
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:56,055
<i>Dear Dad...</i>

931
01:19:56,255 --> 01:19:58,935
<i>I only did this to be able
to go with you,</i>

932
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:00,599
<i>but you didn't understand.</i>

933
01:20:00,735 --> 01:20:02,735
<i>I'll take care of myself,</i>

934
01:20:02,895 --> 01:20:05,415
<i>because I don't want to go
to the snow.</i>

935
01:20:05,615 --> 01:20:09,832
<i>You'll be able to walk quietly
with Janine in Bangkok. Goodbye.</i>

936
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:13,403
Shit.

937
01:20:28,135 --> 01:20:29,775
I'm so happy to see you!

938
01:20:36,895 --> 01:20:39,255
But what's up, Franck?

939
01:20:39,672 --> 01:20:40,672
Laurent...

940
01:20:41,815 --> 01:20:42,815
"Laurent"?

941
01:20:45,695 --> 01:20:47,172
He's run away.

942
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:49,614
"Run away"?

943
01:21:03,575 --> 01:21:06,020
It's so sad him saying
"You can walk quietly."

944
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:11,043
He's misspelled it.

945
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:36,775
Excuse me, Madam.
Is Janine here?

946
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:38,975
No, she's gone out.

947
01:21:42,655 --> 01:21:44,175
There, there, little one...

948
01:21:45,056 --> 01:21:46,564
She won't be late.

949
01:21:47,775 --> 01:21:49,135
Come inside.

950
01:21:53,135 --> 01:21:55,689
No, inspector.
1 metre 39.

951
01:21:56,815 --> 01:22:00,228
Yes, Inspector.
I'll wait to hear from you.

952
01:22:00,778 --> 01:22:01,778
Thank you.

953
01:22:22,695 --> 01:22:23,695
Thank you.

954
01:22:30,535 --> 01:22:32,408
- Is that you there?
- Yes.

955
01:22:32,575 --> 01:22:33,975
I was a singer.

956
01:22:36,255 --> 01:22:37,975
Drink it while it's hot.

957
01:22:39,335 --> 01:22:41,939
I'm sure you've never
heard "Carmen" sung.

958
01:23:25,855 --> 01:23:27,975
- Like it?
- Not bad.

959
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:33,975
Pardon?

960
01:23:34,855 --> 01:23:36,615
How come he's at your place?

961
01:23:38,775 --> 01:23:40,295
What's he doing there?

962
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,815
Janine, he's at your place.

963
01:23:51,975 --> 01:23:55,935
Attention. Departure of
Thaï International flight 905...

964
01:23:56,095 --> 01:23:59,415
destination Frankfurt
and Bangkok....

965
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:01,575
...boarding now.

966
01:24:01,735 --> 01:24:05,338
Please present your boarding card
to the hostess.

967
01:24:06,295 --> 01:24:09,455
Thaï International
wishes you a pleasant journey.

968
01:24:14,495 --> 01:24:18,175
Passport, vaccines.
The dough...

969
01:24:20,775 --> 01:24:23,955
<i>Mr Dad had a trivial life...</i>

970
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:27,535
<i>A sweet little girlfriend,
just a bit of a bother</i>

971
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:31,215
<i>Because Mr Dad
had but one desire,</i>

972
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:34,615
<i>to be as one with his kid.</i>

973
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:38,695
<i>Mr Dad had his little boy</i>

974
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:42,375
<i>who ran the house,
taught him a lesson.</i>

975
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:46,175
because Mr Dad, in his desires

976
01:24:46,335 --> 01:24:49,615
<i>was even smaller than his son.</i>

977
01:25:01,975 --> 01:25:05,015
<i>Mr Dad said to his wife</i>

978
01:25:05,175 --> 01:25:08,775
<i>"It's okay, now that
I keep the apartment"</i>

979
01:25:08,935 --> 01:25:12,575
<i>because Mr Dad
for once, knew how to do it</i>

980
01:25:12,735 --> 01:25:15,975
<i>Conducting his business
in an upside down way</i>

981
01:25:17,055 --> 01:25:20,055
<i>Mr Dad had a certain charm</i>

982
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,735
<i>When at thirty-one
he got it together,</i>

983
01:25:23,895 --> 01:25:27,455
<i>only Mr Dad felt torn.</i>

984
01:25:27,615 --> 01:25:30,935
<i>A shared love is only half...</i>

985
01:25:43,295 --> 01:25:46,575
<i>Mr Dad wanted a mum</i>

986
01:25:46,735 --> 01:25:50,015
<i>to take care kindly
of his little child</i>

987
01:25:50,175 --> 01:25:53,815
<i>Only Mr Dad had a rascal</i>

988
01:25:53,975 --> 01:25:57,255
<i>who politely said
"Go to blazes"</i>

989
01:25:58,255 --> 01:26:01,335
<i>Mr Dad wanted to live his life</i>

990
01:26:01,621 --> 01:26:05,061
<i>and leave his little one
at least a lifetime</i>

991
01:26:05,175 --> 01:26:08,655
<i>So Mr Dad began to say</i>

992
01:26:08,815 --> 01:26:10,055
<i>that he was going to work</i>
