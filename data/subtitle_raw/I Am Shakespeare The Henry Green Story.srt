00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:26,287
- "Listen, if you shoot
him, put two in his face.

5
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:29,267
"This gun is long but
it's not that powerful,

6
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:32,100
"so if you shoot him one time,
it's not gonna kill him."

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,330
He said that to me like
it was good advice,

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,860
and gave me a little pat on the shoulder,

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,593
like he just taught his son
how to ask a girl to prom.

10
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:50,233
I think I was 15 when I
bought that gun, 15 or 16.

11
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:06,107
Newhallville is changing all the time,

12
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,710
and the more it changes,

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,550
the more it stays the same.
(moody blues music)

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,900
There are specific sections that are owned

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,970
by certain groups of young men

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,680
and it's crazy that one
small street, like a block,

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,180
something that could be
maybe 100 yards in length,

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,670
can be owned so tightly
that you could be afraid

19
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,720
to into go to that corner store

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,580
if you're from another section

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,470
and this is all just a couple blocks.

22
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,700
You can drive through the Ville probably

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,920
within four to five minutes
and each section is so heavily

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,313
guarded, almost.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,730
Strange.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,730
It's like guerrilla warfare,
it's like civil war,

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,890
all within a tiny area.

28
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,300
And sometimes these small
sections or factions are allies.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,370
Sometimes they get along.

30
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,393
And then other times,

31
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,020
they're beefing so hard with one another

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,580
that if you go to a specific corner store

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,420
that is in another person's
area, there's a great chance

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,823
that you'll be shot at or
killed or stabbed or robbed.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,970
Where you get off at the
bus stop is very important.

36
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,460
You gotta know what streets
or what area you can walk to.

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,890
If you're from a specific area,

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,700
you may have to take the longest way home

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,260
just to walk all the way
around to avoid another spot

40
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,965
that you're not allowed to go into,

41
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:24,798
(acoustic blues music)

42
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:26,730
where it's dangerous for you to go into.

43
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:30,310
And then if you go further
down street up Dixwell,

44
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,510
there's Yale University.

45
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,503
Where everyone has a Starbucks
cup and a peacoat on.

46
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,833
But inside the Ville,

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,633
it's a different world.

48
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,860
And I remember the terror on
my mom's face all the time

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,960
and I remember the terror
on my brother's face

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,900
and they would always say,

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,430
I used to hear this all the time,

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,267
all different points of the day,

53
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,405
"Henry, come inside right now,

54
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,000
"Henry, come inside right now."

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,590
At different points in
the day and I never knew

56
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,300
how much danger I was escaping.

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,263
I never knew people were being killed.

58
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,160
I never knew people were
being molested, like friends,

59
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,780
family, people close to
me, houses next door,

60
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,513
I never knew that and to a
certain degree, my childhood was,

61
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,260
it was like a sanctuary
in the middle of hell.

62
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,520
Then at some point in time,

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,823
your innocent world just crashes.

64
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,653
It crashes around you.

65
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,660
My teacher had proposed that

66
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,770
my mother bring us some cups
and some juice, some cupcakes

67
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,430
and some juice and some
chips, some snacks or whatever

68
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,430
for this birthday party
that she wanted my mom

69
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,603
to throw for me.

70
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:47,540
All the kids, whenever
they had a birthday,

71
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,410
their parents would come
in and they would bring in

72
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,170
some candy or something for the kids

73
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,040
and it was kind of the norm.

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,917
And she said, "Henry, go
tell your mom to bring us

75
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,780
"some cupcakes and
everything for the next day."

76
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,990
I go home, I ask my
mom, of course she says,

77
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,240
the same sentence, "Honey,
we can't afford it,"

78
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,660
so I go into class the next day,

79
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,437
when my teacher calls
me up in front of her

80
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:09,290
and the whole class is staring.

81
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,660
It's dead quiet in the classroom

82
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,030
and I walk up with my head down

83
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,820
'cause I'm already embarrassed

84
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,627
and the teacher says, "What's wrong?

85
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:20,670
"Why didn't you bring the cupcakes?

86
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,890
"Why didn't you bring the juice?"

87
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,260
And I say, "My mom said
we couldn't afford it."

88
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,590
And I'll never forget
what this teacher said.

89
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,447
This teacher looked at me and said,

90
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:33,600
"It's only cupcakes and
juice, you can't afford that?"

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,600
In short, I was poor. (laughs)

92
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:40,960
And you never know you're poor

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,810
until you're compared to
somebody else, like food stamps,

94
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,850
I don't care what nobody
say about food stamps, yo.

95
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,850
It's the most embarrassing
thing to walk into a line

96
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,540
and swipe that card, I feel like,

97
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,620
and this may just me being paranoid,

98
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,930
but I feel like the cashier
kind of gives you a side eye,

99
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,760
like this nigga's on food
stamps, you know what I'm saying?

100
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,258
Okay, you didn't earn this,
you know what I'm saying,

101
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:08,650
you didn't earn this, and
all that made me angry.

102
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,399
It made me angry to the point
where I did not want to use

103
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,017
food stamps, I didn't
want to use my mom's card

104
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:14,850
to go and buy nothing,
you know what I'm saying.

105
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,330
I hated going to the
grocery store with her.

106
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,230
If she was gonna use her food stamps card.

107
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,163
I never said that to her
but it was embarrassing.

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,173
And after a certain point,
you start to lose it.

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,040
It be enough is enough.

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,413
You reach a certain limit.

111
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,960
You're wearing the same
hand me downs every day

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
up through eighth grade.

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,630
If your brother's friends
go to the same school as you

114
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,690
and he wears a shirt one day

115
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,440
and then the next day
you're wearing a shirt

116
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,600
he was wearing the day before,

117
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,830
it becomes kind of hard to hide,

118
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,080
and it becomes kind of
hard for kids to miss.

119
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,190
And you know what's crazy is that

120
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,440
everyone else can live in
the same projects with you.

121
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,580
They could live in the
same neighborhood with you,

122
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,610
but for some reason every time
they walk to the bus stop,

123
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,850
they look fresh.

124
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,610
They still have a brand new jacket,

125
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,820
they still have good shoes,

126
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,123
they're dressed well and you're not.

127
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,159
And then you start to question,
what am I doing differently?

128
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,017
What am I missing, what am
I lacking that they have?

129
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:17,017
(moody blues music)

130
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,370
I always felt like other people loved me

131
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,620
more than I loved myself.

132
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,010
(moody music)

133
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,430
Every time someone would talk about me,

134
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,960
I would be confused,
people would say things

135
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,060
and it's like, who are they talking about?

136
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,760
Then every now and then, like
a teacher would pull me aside

137
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,380
and say something to me at
the time which was cryptic,

138
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,707
they say, "You know,
Henry, you're very talented

139
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:53,114
"and we don't want you
to throw that away."

140
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:57,207
and my response would be
like, "Cool, me neither.

141
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,280
"So, see you later."(laughs)

142
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,123
I didn't know what they were poking at.

143
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,650
Some people wanted me to go into acting,

144
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,480
people wanted me to, I had
a teacher at Juilliard,

145
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,850
who was pushing me to
audition at Juilliard,

146
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,140
because of a summer theater program I did,

147
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,483
and I had so many people saying

148
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,870
"You should do this, you should do this."

149
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,480
My response was, "I might."

150
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,920
I just for some reason,
I just didn't care.

151
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,070
There were other things that
were on my mind stronger.

152
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,460
There was so much more danger.

153
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,720
There was the danger that
I never knew was around

154
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,830
started coming for me.

155
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,247
My little brother texts me and says,

156
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,030
"Yo, I just got robbed on our porch."

157
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,420
I get up out of class, I rush down there,

158
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,710
I go, I get a gun from my boy.

159
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,610
And I run down, we go around
looking for this person,

160
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,310
because now he knows where I live.

161
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,210
He's gonna come back, so
then I call other people

162
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,690
we go start looking for him.

163
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,367
And I go back to class the
next day and the teachers like,

164
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,507
"Oh, well you shouldn't just get up

165
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,360
"and come out of class like
that in the middle class."

166
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,257
And I'm like, "Somebody
pulled a gun on my brother.

167
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:01,667
"I don't really care about
my English paper right now."

168
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:05,757
I felt like everyone I knew
was in danger all the time.

169
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,073
If I left my post who was
gonna to protect them?

170
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,740
I don't know, it's
easier to leave your post

171
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,070
when you feel like everything's okay.

172
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,210
If you feel like you leave your post

173
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,410
and someone's gonna die.

174
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,420
It's a scarier thought
like how many people

175
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,640
will go to college if they thought

176
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,510
that their sister or brother will get shot

177
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,810
with them not being their?

178
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,223
College wasn't as important.

179
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,150
I didn't know what theater was
for me at the time actually.

180
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,503
I don't think I knew it was important.

181
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,233
I didn't know what was important to me.

182
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,970
At that point in time, it was my fix

183
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,010
and what other people saw as my talent

184
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,900
and as a bargaining card for success,

185
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,010
I just saw as my fix.

186
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,180
Everyone was going to college,

187
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,067
everyone was applying for
colleges and discussing,

188
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,807
"Oh, I'm going to Temple
University, I'm going to NYU

189
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,257
"Henry, where are you going?"

190
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,640
But when people were asked
me where I was going,

191
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,450
I had no idea.

192
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,050
And that's because I had
no idea who I wanted to be.

193
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,500
I had two personalities that

194
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,840
were supposed to be joined into one

195
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,543
But my, I was split.

196
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,981
I didn't know how I wanted to be.

197
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:28,793
I didn't know who I was supposed to be.

198
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,410
I never did it because I thought I'd be

199
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,083
a professional at it one day.

200
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,693
I did it for myself.

201
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,993
And then when everyone went to college,

202
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:43,836
I had no direction.

203
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,687
I didn't feel worthy.

204
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:58,415
I didn't feel like I deserved it.

205
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,303
I felt like I deserved a new Haven.

206
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,410
My favorite book when I
was in elementary school,

207
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,740
I read this book called "Nightjohn"

208
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,940
about this this slave who

209
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,610
you know what I'm saying
in his circumstances,

210
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,920
would rebel against
against everyone around him

211
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
'cause he would teach
the slaves how to read

212
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,340
and he will run and help him escape.

213
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,590
And I wanted to be
Nightjohn so bad, you know,

214
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,800
I wanted to be able to just rebel

215
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,033
against everything that I should be,

216
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,350
Nightjohn should be a slave,

217
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,610
he shouldn't be able to read.

218
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,200
He should listen to his masters

219
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,870
and I just wanted to rebel against that.

220
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,263
I wanted to be the best,

221
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,550
the best person at where I was

222
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,140
and lead them into the next phase.

223
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,640
I wanted to be that so bad.

224
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,443
I thought that was coolest thing ever.

225
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,870
Renegade, that name was
a originally given to me,

226
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,373
by my brother, my little brother, Solomon.

227
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,610
The name means to defect or to betray,

228
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,280
to leave one group and become a soloist,

229
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,380
so to leave one group and to join another.

230
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,470
He originally gave me that name because

231
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,563
I never wanted to be
exactly like everyone.

232
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,177
So then my little brother said to me,

233
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:30,610
"So you kind of like a renegade?"

234
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,970
And I was like, "Yeah, that's right."

235
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,480
I had to find some type of way

236
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,033
to name what I was doing positively.

237
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,300
Sooner or later, though, that name

238
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,270
began to mean something very different.

239
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,090
I had this dream of this
guy, this powerful guy,

240
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,363
with no face,

241
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,690
chained in this room,

242
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,690
locked up with a chain and a skeleton key

243
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,570
hanging around his neck.

244
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,090
And this was the key to let himself free

245
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,140
but he sat inside this room

246
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,033
and just cried and cried and cried.

247
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,770
He had a key to himself
free, but he didn't.

248
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,713
He was afraid to.

249
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,573
Somehow I began to associate
that person with Renegade.

250
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,420
Kind of like my Jekyll and Hyde.

251
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,530
It wasn't what I wanted it to be.

252
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,940
Renegade was supposed to be the thing

253
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,940
that wasn't afraid of the streets.

254
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,173
He was supposed to be the thing

255
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,951
that wasn't afraid of
people doing him harm.

256
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,370
The person that wasn't afraid to succeed.

257
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,770
But instead, Renegade became

258
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,560
a name for violence.

259
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,957
He became a symbol for apathy,

260
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,243
apathy for life.

261
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,247
And the more I said the name

262
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,240
the less I wanted to be Henry.

263
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,560
The double life thing probably started,

264
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,202
once I became afraid of where I lived.

265
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:12,773
If the thing that rules
your neighborhood is fear,

266
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,980
then you do well there

267
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,550
and you either do well at being afraid,

268
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,548
or you do well at making
other people afraid of you

269
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,463
so that you have less people to fear.

270
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,500
And at first, I did very
well at being afraid.

271
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,200
I did really well at being afraid.

272
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,970
I remember being at the bus stop one time

273
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,460
and I was in like fifth grade.

274
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,677
And I remember some kid saying,

275
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:37,180
"Oh, I'm gonna fight you,
I'm gonna fight you."

276
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,310
And I did not wanna fight.

277
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,670
I didn't know how fight.

278
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,114
In fifth grade, I was
real skinny, awkward,

279
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,500
my ears was huge.

280
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,866
They're probably still
a little big right now.

281
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,374
But you know, I didn't know how to fight.

282
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:51,216
So I remember trying to
worm my way out of this

283
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:52,647
and asking everybody,
you know what I'm saying,

284
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:53,480
"What do I do?

285
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,077
"I don't wanna fight him,
I don't wanna fight him."

286
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,077
And I remember somebody standing
me up straight and saying,

287
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:59,827
"Listen, you don't want niggas
to think you're a pussy.

288
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:01,520
"If you don't want them to think that

289
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,010
"then you have to fight him."

290
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,993
Ronda won.

291
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,250
And I remember coming
to this realization like

292
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,623
that there is no escape.

293
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,020
There's no escape from it.

294
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,403
If you want to escape, you have
to make them afraid of you.

295
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,850
I became slightly addicted

296
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,090
to taking things from other people.

297
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,520
Even if it was I'm just
taking their dignity

298
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,470
and a horribly violent way.

299
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,270
When it came to me targeting people.

300
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,720
I think, to me, my main enemy first

301
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,893
was people who I thought were
gonna put me in harm's way.

302
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,990
Any person who that was was a target.

303
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,980
But mainly it was black people.

304
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,490
I mean, to be honest, I mean,
a few Puerto Rican people

305
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,830
like it's New Haven.

306
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,830
So the colors that separated
people were mainly gang colors.

307
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,200
That defined you almost
as much as race did.

308
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,440
We divided ourselves in
our own little subculture.

309
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,450
And that is how I was able
to divide people in my mind.

310
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,400
So I had enemies based upon their faction,

311
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,630
and most times they were
black and Puerto Rican.

312
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,300
The second enemy for me personally,

313
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,779
I think this was a personal thing for me

314
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,770
and a couple of people who I knew

315
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,720
were people who are of
a higher class than us.

316
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,690
The thing about New Haven is

317
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,430
New Haven can be broke on
one side of the street,

318
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,910
one side of the street, houses boarded up,

319
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,280
naked babies running around,
crack noodles everywhere.

320
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,090
Liquor store and corner store
and a church for some reason

321
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,730
on every corner, right?

322
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,083
You go 10 minutes up the street, mansions.

323
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,330
Why are there mansions,
if I live in a project

324
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,163
down the street from you?

325
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:46,240
And you think you can walk?

326
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,140
You think you can walk
through these projects,

327
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,763
and you gonna be street
when you got a mansion?

328
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,370
Okay, that's what made
you my enemy right there

329
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,300
is you're gonna live life to the fullest

330
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,660
right next to me when I'm
in a projects, really?

331
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,850
That's what you're going to do?

332
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,550
So for me that made them a target.

333
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,290
And I didn't care what race you were.

334
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,700
I didn't care, that's not
what made life unfair.

335
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,470
The thing that made life
unfair was who had the power.

336
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,987
And either you have power through a gun

337
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,943
or you have power through cash.

338
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,400
And if you had power through cash,

339
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,960
I was a little more angry at you.

340
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,653
So if I could use that same
fear that was used on me on you,

341
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,245
then that's your fault.

342
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,350
That's really what I thought.

343
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,660
And if I saw weakness in other people

344
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,513
that I once had to myself,

345
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,140
it made me hate them.

346
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,060
It made me hate them because

347
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,590
I was weak at some point

348
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,940
and I felt like it was
my fault for being weak.

349
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,444
So I don't know.

350
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,773
Don't be weak.

351
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,963
It's your fault for being weak.

352
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:19,340
(upbeat music)

353
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,250
You know, I remember being
downtown a lot in high school

354
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,760
and watching Yale students
ride by on their bikes,

355
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,130
and they'd be going from class to class

356
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,600
from restaurant to restaurant,

357
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,750
enjoying life laughing,
smiling all the time,

358
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,260
walking in front of traffic.

359
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,430
And no matter where we
were, for some reason

360
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,240
us as kids, it'll be a group my friends

361
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,160
we'd be like 10 of us.

362
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,993
We were a problem.

363
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,190
The police would come over

364
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,940
and they won't want us in a group.

365
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,773
You gotta move here.

366
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,606
You have to do this.

367
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,910
This is school property.

368
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,400
But Yale's never had a problem.

369
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,853
They were going to a great
school, they had great clothes.

370
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,450
They just were happy all the time.

371
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,450
And I felt like it was something,

372
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,302
I remember feeling like

373
00:17:58,302 --> 00:17:59,610
this is something that
they didn't deserve,

374
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,660
you didn't earn this.

375
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,383
I remember feeling that and
I remember feeling angry.

376
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,780
And then I started to catch a pattern.

377
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,840
Whenever I would walk
with my friends downtown,

378
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,950
it'd be a group of five, 10 of us,

379
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,400
you know, wearing all black hoodies.

380
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,413
And if they saw us coming,
they would cross the street.

381
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,033
And at first, I didn't
really take notice to it.

382
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,900
But after a while, I started to recognize

383
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,470
this look in their eyes.

384
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,279
It was this look of fear.

385
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,596
It was this expression of fear.

386
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:40,429
And for some reason,

387
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,250
my power was greater than
theirs at that moment.

388
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,083
And these are the same people

389
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,900
that are going to one
of the top universities.

390
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,190
And I'm more powerful than you right now

391
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,410
because you're afraid of me.

392
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,993
I was able to take their pride.

393
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,113
One, just because of how I looked.

394
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,770
If I could take your pride

395
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,470
you know, what else can I take?

396
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,720
Not only can I take your pride
but I can take your bike.

397
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,820
If I can take your bike,
I can take your phone.

398
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,323
If I can take your phone,
I can take your cash.

399
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,810
And if I can do that,

400
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,453
then I'm more powerful than you.

401
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,623
I have control now.

402
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,160
And it's an addictive feeling.

403
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,095
You don't have control over
anything else in your life

404
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,953
but you have control over this person.

405
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,570
What's funny is, it's never
actually about the money

406
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,760
'cause you can't take enough from someone

407
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,960
to the point we'd be
able to live off of it.

408
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,960
It's never about the money,
it's about the control.

409
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,930
You have to somehow make it so that

410
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,880
you feel sane where you are,

411
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,940
so that you feel like I'm in
the best situation possible.

412
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,560
I did that in school
by getting good grades.

413
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,860
I did that in the streets

414
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,080
by inflicting fear when I
needed to where I needed to

415
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,243
and materialistically I did
it from taking from people.

416
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,473
It made me feel like I had
control over my own situation.

417
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,290
I remember another time

418
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,650
when there was a kid downtown

419
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,050
who had said something
to one of my friends

420
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,893
and someone comes from behind him.

421
00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:28,970
One of my friends comes from behind,

422
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,670
and I don't even know if
this kid said something

423
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,547
along the lines of

424
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:34,897
"Watch where you're going."

425
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,820
And that was enough,

426
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,193
that was enough challenge.

427
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,270
One of my friends come
behind and smacks this kid.

428
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,860
You know like, right hook to
the right side of his face

429
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,210
from behind.

430
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,210
And the rest of us come in and
just start unloading punches

431
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,363
and kicks on this guy.

432
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,360
And we feel powerful

433
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,053
because we're able to
make one person cower.

434
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,140
And this was actually a
kid that was pretty big,

435
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,393
he wasn't a small kid.

436
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,180
And he's on the ground and we kick him

437
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,210
and we punch him and in these moments,

438
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,060
everything's happening so fast

439
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,840
that you don't wanna miss your chance

440
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,173
to be a part of the event.

441
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,840
You don't want to miss your
chance to prove to other people

442
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,600
that when something happens,
when something goes down,

443
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,700
you'll play your part.

444
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,830
And inflicting pain on a stranger is

445
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,723
it can be thrilling
and it can be exciting.

446
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,960
Everyone around you is watching.

447
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,010
You hear the crowd reacting and it's like

448
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,973
you almost feel like a
gladiator in a coliseum.

449
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,212
(acoustic blues music)

450
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:16,430
You know relating to Tybalt was probably

451
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,710
one of the easiest
characters I've ever played.

452
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,033
I felt like he was me.

453
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,740
He said some of the things I would say

454
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,840
except in Shakespearean dialect of course.

455
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,620
He was me, Tybalt was angry and aggressive

456
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,850
but only out of pride,

457
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,310
only out of this desire to
have what you don't have,

458
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,743
and to go and get that at any cost.

459
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,460
And I immediately saw the resemblance,

460
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,093
I saw the similarities
between myself and Tybalt.

461
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,380
That we'd be willing to hurt other people

462
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,550
and hurt ourselves

463
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,150
to hold on to a piece of dignity

464
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,763
or a piece of pride or reputation.

465
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,963
Something that I think
Shakespeare stories,

466
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,200
something that they do
is he talks about pain,

467
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,813
I feel like in such a way
that I was able to relate to.

468
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,383
He didn't sugarcoat anything.

469
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,880
When I was able to
transfer like translate it

470
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,353
and understand the language,

471
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,370
suddenly this dude was
reading out my diaries,

472
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,820
it sounded like, you know,

473
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,440
and he was speaking about things

474
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,323
that everyone is going
through and no one listens to.

475
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,220
Then it stops being a play.

476
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,020
He stops being a character.

477
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,433
He starts being a reflection of your life.

478
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,200
You focus on on walking in their shoes

479
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,410
and breathing in their
shoes and feeling emotion

480
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,563
from their perspective.

481
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,200
If there's no other way to forget

482
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,810
what you're going through

483
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,780
that's the way right there.

484
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,660
Acting in front of
hundreds, maybe thousands.

485
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,400
Such a powerful classical
piece with people

486
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,770
who are considered the cream of the crop

487
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,330
in the acting world,

488
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,330
and me coming from Co-op High School,

489
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,749
you know what I'm saying,
coming from New Oroville.

490
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,263
It was real man.

491
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,923
I felt easily like the most
important person on the planet.

492
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,123
After Romeo and Juliet was over,

493
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,490
I had so much idle time

494
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,023
and I lost contact with Henry.

495
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,243
I just had way too much
time to be Renegade.

496
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,200
I felt like I didn't fully belong

497
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,180
in a world where people
thought I was a great actor,

498
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,300
I was a great student,

499
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,400
'cause I didn't believe that about myself.

500
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,580
I didn't wanna go back to a world of fear,

501
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,543
paranoia and violence.

502
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,933
And I had no one to tell about it.

503
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,283
I was always looking to
reach out to anybody.

504
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,760
I just had to wait for the right person,

505
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,900
and it had to be someone

506
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,630
who wasn't proud of me on either side.

507
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,770
It couldn't be someone who
was proud of me in the streets

508
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,140
and it couldn't be someone
who was proud of me

509
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,483
in the world of theater or
school or anything like that.

510
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,810
I remember I met this girl

511
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,490
'cause it was always a
girl who liked me whatever.

512
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,490
And I remember calling her

513
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,300
and her thought was, "Oh, I like Renegade,

514
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,200
Oh, he's gonna call me blah, blah, blah."

515
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,670
So she's all happy and everything.

516
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,210
And I remember calling her

517
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,060
and talking to her for a few minutes.

518
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,270
And I remember trying to vent to her

519
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,093
to tell her my situation.

520
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,327
I remember trying to tell her,

521
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:32,633
"Sometimes I don't wanna live anymore.

522
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:39,357
"Sometimes I wish that all
I can do is be on the stage.

523
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,653
"I'm afraid that people
are trying to kill me.

524
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,847
"And I need help."

525
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,631
And I never said that sentence before.

526
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:53,197
I never said that to anybody.

527
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:56,173
And this was a nobody
girl, this was a nobody.

528
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,070
But I had to reach out to someone.

529
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,977
I said, "And I need help."

530
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,690
And I remember her reaction being,

531
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:18,297
"Oh okay, I gotta go, this is weird.

532
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:22,897
"You should call the police.

533
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:25,397
"I don't know, but I'll text you."

534
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,319
And when a girl says that,

535
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,530
you already know what that means.

536
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,580
She's not gonna text you.

537
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,650
She's not gonna call you.

538
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,760
That means, leave me alone,
don't call me no more.

539
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,460
You did something to weird me out.

540
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,240
And I remember hanging up the phone

541
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,230
and feeling so alone

542
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,667
and feeling like I didn't
belong in either world.

543
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,620
And I remember going upstairs

544
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,720
into my room and I had kept
a gun inside of a book bag

545
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:10,423
that was inside of another bag
that was inside of this box.

546
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,880
And I remember going
upstairs and taking a gun

547
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,873
and staring at the barrel for a long time.

548
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,570
And the way a gun trigger works
is you pull it a little bit

549
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,403
and all this power and
fury unleashes all at once.

550
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,297
And I remember debating,
could this end anything?

551
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,573
Could this help me
belong in a better place?

552
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,770
'Cause I didn't feel
like I belonged anywhere

553
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,980
and I did not like my life to the point

554
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,343
where I wanted it to end.

555
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,910
And I pushed the thought
away and I put the gun back.

556
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,860
And I didn't talk to anyone about that.

557
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,180
But then I remember leaving

558
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,710
and hoping that someone would
kill me for some reason.

559
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,140
And whenever there was a time

560
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,710
where I thought somebody
was gonna be doing

561
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,191
something stupid I went.

562
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:49,280
(upbeat music)

563
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,030
Actually in the wintertime,

564
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,430
there's a term that
everybody in New Haven anyway

565
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,180
that on behalf of wintertime
they call it grimy season.

566
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,460
They call it grimy season

567
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,640
because during those months
when it starts to get cold

568
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,240
and it starts to get dark early,

569
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,230
everyone becomes a little bit more bitter,

570
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,170
everyone becomes a little more violent.

571
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,540
The chance of you getting
robbed increases dramatically,

572
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:19,350
the chance of someone doing
a home invasion in your house

573
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,520
increases dramatically.

574
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,610
It's dark earlier, it's easier
for people to do crimes.

575
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,113
And you can feel the
transition into grimy season.

576
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,560
There was such an influx,

577
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,460
like an increase in
violence in New Oroville.

578
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,520
I remember this one time
we were walking up shouting

579
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,100
and we ran into this old guy who we knew

580
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
who used to be really well known.

581
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,340
He's just this old man.

582
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,630
He had a funny voice, really raspy voice

583
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,900
and he had a cane all the time.

584
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,760
And we ask him, "Yo what's
going on, like what happened?"

585
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,747
And he says, "Yo, these
three kids, they came up

586
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:57,787
"and I'm a old man and they they rob me

587
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,407
"and after I gave them everything I had,

588
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:00,697
"they still started beating me,

589
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,890
"they still started beating on me."

590
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,020
And me and my friends we're
surprised like, "What?"

591
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,160
'Cause this is someone who
no one really messes with

592
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,460
you know, he's an old guy,

593
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,890
everyone knows him around the neighborhood

594
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,440
and like who would do that?

595
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,117
And he was kind of telling us he's like,

596
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:18,950
"Yo, listen, y'all need to watch out,

597
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,020
"y'all need to be careful out here."

598
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,150
And he kept warning us about that.

599
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,090
As the violence increased in the Ville,

600
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,670
I expected it for there always to be

601
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,760
someone ready to attack me,
someone ready to hurt me.

602
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,210
And it's like every couple
weeks or every few days

603
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,270
you hear story about someone
who you knew that got shot,

604
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,980
you hear someone that you
knew that got cornered

605
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,790
and jumped and beat
down by multiple people.

606
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,512
You hear stories about and
these are innocent people,

607
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:50,977
some of them are bangers,
some of them were criminals.

608
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:53,090
But it seems like everyone

609
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,063
was a target at this point in time.

610
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:04,260
It felt like a quiet night initially.

611
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,043
It was cold, dry.

612
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,460
Like a typical winter night,

613
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,880
real starry, I remember that.

614
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,080
Bus ride wasn't but four
minutes from downtown

615
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,210
to get to my bus stop
which was on Munson Street

616
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,770
and Dixwell Ave.

617
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,270
I usually get off right there.

618
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,430
I hopped off and my boy
D-Eazy was waiting for me,

619
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,210
one of my little brother's friends.

620
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,100
Nice kid, wasn't involved
in anything crazy,

621
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,450
not involved in any criminal activity.

622
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,950
He was just a nice kid
that I liked to chill with.

623
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,950
I hopped off the bus and
D-Eazy is all happy to see me.

624
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,700
He's dancing at the bus
stop,(laughs) looking crazy.

625
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,410
This was one of those 'cause
no matter where he was at,

626
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,460
he was always getting liked all the time.

627
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,240
I meet up with D-Eazy and
he starts telling me about

628
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,300
this day that he had.

629
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,120
He starts telling me about
this girl that broke his heart.

630
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,920
That's usually what we talked about,

631
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,263
you know, girls that broke his heart.

632
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,820
And during the first
few steps down a block,

633
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,720
it just felt like a normal night,

634
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,233
we felt good, we felt safe.

635
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,720
And then we spotted these four boys

636
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,680
and there's a certain
dress that people have

637
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,630
when you know that they're out robbing.

638
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:37,360
It's like standard, it's a black hoodie.

639
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,080
All black hoodie, hood up,
a black ski mask, dark pants

640
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,093
and sometimes they have some gloves on.

641
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,590
And when I see people wearing this outfit,

642
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,710
I know that they're robbing.

643
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,350
They are dressed in a certain way

644
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,940
where no matter how you describe them,

645
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,190
the police won't be able
to narrow them down.

646
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,470
I see these four people,

647
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,440
they're probably maybe like
20, 30 feet in front of me

648
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,440
and I'm walking from Munson up
to Division by Moe's Market.

649
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,813
And I see them and they're walking slow.

650
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,877
I tap my boy D-Eazy and I say,

651
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:19,057
"Yo, look, they robbing people,

652
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,890
"you know what I'm
saying, they're juxing."

653
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,757
So I say, "Yo, listen,

654
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:24,707
"let's just take this right over here."

655
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,800
I think it was Gibbs Street.

656
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,960
So we take that right and we
start cutting down that block

657
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,080
in my hopes to avoid them.

658
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,010
I see these boys, they turn
around, they look back,

659
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,110
they see that we turned down Gibbs Street

660
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,390
and now we're not behind them

661
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:46,390
and they make an about-face,
they make a straight U-Turn

662
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,610
and come back and start speed walking,

663
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,960
they start increasing their speed.

664
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,853
So I know now they're targeting us.

665
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,870
And at this point in time,

666
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,550
you know that there's gonna
be one of two inevitables.

667
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:04,010
You have to run away or
you have to face them

668
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,570
and either deal with whatever harm

669
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,290
they're going to put towards
you or fight them off.

670
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,103
So I know that there's no way out of this.

671
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,980
I start walking a little bit faster

672
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:22,380
and what's crazy is my house is not even

673
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,703
a five second, 10 second walk.

674
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,363
I didn't stop at my house.

675
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,210
I knew if I would have went to my house,

676
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,150
while these guys are behind me,

677
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,696
they would have known where I live.

678
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:40,940
They would have known
where my family lived

679
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,750
and I didn't wanna bring that danger

680
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,860
to my family, to my house.

681
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,120
So I keep walking down Shelton Avenue

682
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,210
and they start speed walking faster.

683
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:57,210
At this point, D-Eazy is
getting extremely nervous

684
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,637
and he starts tapping me saying,

685
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:01,447
"Yo listen, they following
us, they following us man,

686
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:02,597
"we gotta run, we gotta run."

687
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:05,600
And in my mind, I'm
contemplating what to do.

688
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,810
Because for me running
means I've been defeated,

689
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,050
running means that they've
been able to instill fear in me

690
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,173
and they were able to take my pride.

691
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:21,000
I know it sounds dumb and
it doesn't sound like much

692
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,630
but that was the main thing.

693
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,600
That was the most important thing to me.

694
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,230
Most important thing to me
was my dignity, was my pride,

695
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,903
was my control over myself.

696
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,630
Because I know D-Eazy
isn't someone who wanted

697
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,720
to live a life of crime.

698
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,553
I know he was someone

699
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:44,240
that didn't want to be
involved in violence.

700
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,890
I thought it would be
unfair for me to turn around

701
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,240
and face them and involve him in that.

702
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,890
I wanted to face that harm alone,

703
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,023
I wanted to face that danger alone.

704
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,390
He didn't need that pride,
he didn't need that.

705
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,627
So I tell him, "Listen, run."

706
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,710
I told him, "Run."

707
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,703
D-Eazy starts booking
it fast down the street.

708
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,260
I turn around and I
start walking up towards

709
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,633
these four kids that are all blacked out.

710
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,700
The first thing I say, I open my arms

711
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,100
and I say, "Yo what's good?"

712
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,357
When you say, "Yo what's good?"

713
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:26,443
that's the same thing as saying,

714
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:32,653
"Whatever you are ready
to do, let's get it done.

715
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:35,157
"If you're gonna try to stab me,

716
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:36,867
"if you're gonna try to fight me,

717
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:40,377
"if you're gonna walk past me,

718
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:42,677
"let me know your intentions
right now because I'm willing

719
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,077
"to handle whatever you
gonna throw out at me."

720
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,050
So they walk up to me

721
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,440
and the youngest one of the
group is short, light skinned.

722
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,563
It looks like he got he got
braids underneath his ski mask.

723
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,130
He pulls out this shiny nine millimeter

724
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,083
and puts it right on my
stomach, point blank.

725
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,247
And he says to me, "Yo,
give me everything you got."

726
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,850
At this point in time I have
another two choices to make.

727
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,710
I can decide to let go of
everything that I have,

728
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,340
to release whatever bullcrap cash I have

729
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,240
which is probably a few
dollars, maybe my phone

730
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,403
and then with it, my pride.

731
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,713
And I don't want to give up my pride.

732
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,060
And considering what's been happening

733
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,670
in the past few weeks,

734
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,210
everyone who's gotten robbed

735
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,933
has gotten beaten or shot anyway.

736
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,480
Why would I give up my cash

737
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,973
and my pride and then
still take a beating.

738
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,180
I know the possibility of me
getting shot is a little high

739
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,463
but I test those limits,
I push those limits.

740
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,540
See the thing about the
kid who was holding the gun

741
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,293
is his hand was noticeably shaking.

742
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,130
When you hold a gun to somebody,

743
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,200
when you hold any weapon to somebody,

744
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,290
when you're standing there

745
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,860
and it's your strength
against their strength

746
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,360
and you're trying to rob them,

747
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,403
it's a scary moment.

748
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,010
Everything is on the line.

749
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,720
Your pride is on the line,

750
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,913
your self esteem is on the line really.

751
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,070
You're trying to conquer another person

752
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,543
mentally and emotionally.

753
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,810
You're trying to overcome
them through intimidation.

754
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,450
And since I've done that
to other people before,

755
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,950
I didn't want someone to
be able to do that to me.

756
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,883
So my response to this kid is,

757
00:40:12,697 --> 00:40:16,347
"I'm not giving you nothing,
I don't got nothing for you."

758
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,390
Now me saying that, now
I'm challenging him.

759
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,580
He tried to overcome me
and I'm pushing back.

760
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:28,580
When you do this, the levels,
the risk continues to rise.

761
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,860
He rises up here, he gave
me you know what I'm saying

762
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,657
he put the gun on my stomach,
gave me an ultimatum,

763
00:40:33,657 --> 00:40:36,060
"Give everything you got
or I'm gonna shoot you."

764
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,117
And I raise it here, "I'm
not giving you everything,

765
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:39,617
"I'm not giving you anything."

766
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,960
So if you do want it,
you'll have to kill me,

767
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,160
you'll have to shoot me.

768
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,255
The only way that that
ends is one of us win.

769
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:51,770
(slow acoustic music)

770
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,584
And he has these three kids
behind him that are all

771
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:57,247
egging him on "Yo shoot him,

772
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,270
"yo shoot that nigga
yo, shoot that nigga."

773
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,530
And you can see in this kid's head,

774
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,880
he's having a battle inside his mind.

775
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,570
You know there's people behind him

776
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,360
that are watching him,

777
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,890
that are analyzing and
critiquing his power,

778
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,643
that are critiquing the
control that he has over me.

779
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,240
That are egging him on
that are pushing him on.

780
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,720
And in his own mind,
he is probably debating

781
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,830
'cause I'd be debating the same thing.

782
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,460
You know, what's worth it?

783
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,693
If I shoot this guy, I will
get dignity, I will get pride,

784
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:35,803
I'll get the sense of control.

785
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,853
But the risk,

786
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,410
one, you're taking somebody's life,

787
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,923
two, jail time possibly.

788
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,400
And it shows how important pride is,

789
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,000
it shows how important control is.

790
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,920
If the benefit of getting pride

791
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,240
is just as high as the risk

792
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,160
or as higher than a risk of jail time

793
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,120
and of taking somebody's
life, it's worth that.

794
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,003
In that world, it's worth that.

795
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,510
This verbal battle last
maybe five seconds,

796
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,080
but if Feels like an eternity

797
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,660
because it's two lives clashing,

798
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,413
two lives with the same struggle.

799
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,880
And in the heat of this battle

800
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,130
and in the heat of this conflict,

801
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,560
I'm able for a split second,

802
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,560
I don't know if this was
God giving me a moment

803
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,320
or clearing my mind so
that I can see this,

804
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,210
so I can see beyond my primal instinct,

805
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:53,183
my Renegade mindset.

806
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,850
But I was able to clearly see

807
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,100
beyond this little world for a second.

808
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,020
For a second I was able to
see beyond me versus him

809
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,770
and I was able to see beyond New Oroville,

810
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,810
I was able to see me on
New Haven, Connecticut,

811
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,800
and this is only for a few seconds,

812
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,800
but I saw a lost child in this kid's eyes.

813
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,703
I saw a human being that
was lacking something.

814
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,070
A human being that was
lacking understanding.

815
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,523
I saw a human being that was
confused and hurt and angry.

816
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,163
And I guess in that sense I saw a mirror.

817
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,783
I saw a mirror in his eyes.

818
00:43:47,193 --> 00:43:48,970
And it's at that point that I see

819
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,510
the similarity between
me and this young man.

820
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,450
I see how we're both broken.

821
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,930
We're both fighting for control

822
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,833
that we are lacking in our lives.

823
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,310
I see how we're both the same

824
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
in that brief second

825
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:10,886
and then the gun went off.

826
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,330
A lot of people asked me
if I saw a white light

827
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,453
and the response that I give to people is,

828
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,373
at that point in my life,

829
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:35,194
there's no way I would have been seeing

830
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:39,603
a white light at all and
that's just being honest.

831
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,484
There would have been no
white light coming for me.

832
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:47,401
(slow blues music)

833
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,347
During the coma, I think
the thing I remember most

834
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,373
was my dad coming to visit me.

835
00:45:09,736 --> 00:45:12,236
See, like, I've never seen
my dad cry before this,

836
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:18,010
and in a coma, everyone thought
that I couldn't hear them

837
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,920
but I heard everything to the point

838
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,480
where I came back to
people after I woke up

839
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,233
and I told them what they said.

840
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,160
My dad came in, teary eye and he said,

841
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:37,803
"How you doing H?

842
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:41,033
"You're gonna get out of here soon,

843
00:45:44,087 --> 00:45:45,537
"everything's gonna be fine."

844
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:50,820
And then I remember him sniffling

845
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:57,100
and sang, "I love you so much son."

846
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,137
I never felt closer to my dad
than at that point in time.

847
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,300
I couldn't hug him, I couldn't touch him,

848
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,970
I couldn't tell him I heard him

849
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,700
but I never felt closer to my dad.

850
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:23,130
And what's weird is the thing

851
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,373
that allowed that to happen was a bullet.

852
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:37,360
They changed my name from Henry
Green to Stanley Galbraith

853
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,910
because the kid who shot me
was running around still,

854
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,150
they thought that he might
come into the hospital

855
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,530
to finish me off.

856
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,030
So they literally said
we're gonna choose a name

857
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,790
that sounds really white,

858
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,240
so that no one thinks
it'll be you in the charts.

859
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,180
During that entire time, the
doctors were really just trying

860
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,840
to figure out a way for me to stay alive.

861
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,320
My femoral artery had
been singed by the bullet,

862
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,580
the night of and when they
were doing surgery on me,

863
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,260
it actually popped, it popped open.

864
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,140
And a femoral artery is one of

865
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,210
the much larger arteries in your body

866
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,170
so I lost so much blood.

867
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,520
Actually that night or
those first three days

868
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,620
when they're trying to save my life,

869
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,730
I had actually flatlined three times.

870
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,963
So three times total my heart stopped.

871
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,670
They told me that they gave me a total of

872
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,940
I think 42 units of blood.

873
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,390
So a unit of blood is like
the little IV bags of blood

874
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,110
so 42 units is enough to fill
the body a couple of times.

875
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,733
That's how much blood I lost.

876
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,420
All the blood loss took
a toll on my intestines

877
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,240
because the blood from my
femoral artery was coming up

878
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,280
to make sure my intestines
were getting oxygen

879
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,250
and getting life and when the
doctors I had opened me up,

880
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,160
they told me later that they
smell something rotting.

881
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,780
It smelled like garbage and
the thing that was rotting

882
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,960
was actually my intestines.

883
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,120
They were rotting inside my body.

884
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:16,120
I heard one doctor say, they
actually walked up to my mom

885
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,850
and they said, "I'm so
sorry for your loss."

886
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,210
Of course, I'm still alive

887
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,410
but they thought that I was gonna be gone.

888
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:26,887
They started coming in and telling her,

889
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:29,420
"Listen, you have to let go of your son."

890
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,430
There was this one doctor
who kept telling her

891
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,767
that "You have to let go,

892
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:34,497
"you can't keep holding
on to him like this."

893
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,900
And the sad thing is about to be over

894
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,823
after I began learning who I was,

895
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,140
but I wasn't gonna give up there.

896
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,370
I remember the week when I had to learn

897
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,180
how to sit up by myself.

898
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,587
I felt like an infant.

899
00:48:55,587 --> 00:49:00,070
I didn't have the abdominal
strength to be able to sit up

900
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,500
'cause I've been laying down for months.

901
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,490
Imagine when you first wake up
from just sleeping overnight

902
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,650
when you first sit up
you're a little bit dizzy.

903
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:12,700
Imagine laying down and sleeping
for two to three months.

904
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,263
The dizziness is unreal.

905
00:49:15,644 --> 00:49:17,760
I had a practice first
sitting up a little bit.

906
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,700
A little bit for each day.

907
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,380
I would sit up for maybe
5, 10 minutes a day

908
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,880
just to get the strength to sit up.

909
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,600
And they had to stand
me up after a few weeks

910
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,563
and I took my first couple of steps,

911
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,293
steps that they didn't think
I was gonna be able to take.

912
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,400
Sooner or later,

913
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,240
I was able to get myself
around in a wheelchair.

914
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,090
And at that point in time,

915
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,960
they had moved me over to Gaylord Hospital

916
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,083
and here, I really
started my rehabilitation.

917
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,220
I had to learn how to get
around the house again,

918
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,570
I had to learn how to walk.

919
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:55,490
I had to learn how to get out
of my bed and into a walker.

920
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,490
So I came from being this
powerful, strong feared Renegade

921
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:06,180
to walking around with a walker

922
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,313
with a colostomy bag.

923
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,563
Really sharp contrast,

924
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,683
really humbling.

925
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:18,262
(guitar music)

926
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,780
I spent a couple months
at Gaylord Hospital

927
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,330
and then I was finally taken home.

928
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,700
Still with no intestines,

929
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,670
some intestines enough to have a colostomy

930
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,630
but not enough to eat.

931
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,573
So I was I was attached to
this bag which is called TPN.

932
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,350
Total parental nutrition I
think is what TPN stands for

933
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:40,108
and this is bag of white
fluid that they hooked up.

934
00:50:40,108 --> 00:50:42,143
I had wires connected all over me,

935
00:50:42,143 --> 00:50:44,400
I had a tube for my own colostomy bag,

936
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,310
I had another tube that basically fed me.

937
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,420
It was this huge white IV bag

938
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,490
that gave me all the nutrition I needed.

939
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,480
I had a tube for all my IV fluids

940
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,950
because nothing I drank, stayed down.

941
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,290
Anything I drink came in and
came out the colostomy bag.

942
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,430
As a matter of fact,

943
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,350
I would test this by drinking Kool-Aid.

944
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,463
So I would take a red cup of Kool Aid,

945
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,520
even though red isn't a flavor.

946
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,620
It was red Kool-Aid, I would
drink it and in 30 seconds,

947
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,467
you'd see red start coming
out of my colostomy bag.

948
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,600
Anything I ate I couldn't
hide from anybody.

949
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,350
I went to go visit the doctor

950
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,793
to ask them how I was doing.

951
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,780
How I was gonna get out of the situation

952
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,580
'cause at this point in time it was,

953
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,700
this is how my life was
going to be forever.

954
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,340
Just medicine and IV bags

955
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,493
and walking around the house in a walker.

956
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,940
That was gonna be the reality of my life.

957
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:45,350
And I remember being
referred to this hospital,

958
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:50,593
Georgetown University
Hospital in Washington DC.

959
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,320
So we took the train down there,

960
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,080
and the doctor gave me a projection

961
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,260
of how long I was gonna live

962
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
after taking a series of tests.

963
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,207
They said, "You probably
have about five good years."

964
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,550
They told me that there was a chance

965
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,380
for me to get a transplant

966
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,080
an intestinal transplant
which is incredibly rare.

967
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,590
You know you hear about heart transplants,

968
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,350
liver transplants and kidney transplants.

969
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,660
Intestinal is weird,

970
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,023
that's a strange and unique transplant.

971
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:22,780
So they put me on a list

972
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,240
and the only thing I could do is wait.

973
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,230
I waited and I got stronger and stronger

974
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,400
and healthier and healthier

975
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,123
despite what doctors thought might happen.

976
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:38,810
Of course I was still dying slowly

977
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,860
but my physical strength was coming back.

978
00:52:43,698 --> 00:52:47,550
And I had one false alarm actually.

979
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,277
One day they had called me and they said,

980
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:51,830
"Hey, we have a transplant for you."

981
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,680
So they put me in his
private plane, we flew over,

982
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,310
I got to the hospital, I got to my gown.

983
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,890
They took all these tests and
then they walk into the room

984
00:52:58,890 --> 00:52:59,723
and told me, "I'm sorry,

985
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,717
"but this transplant doesn't match you."

986
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,830
Man I flew back to New Haven heartbroken.

987
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,380
And this next time

988
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,150
that I went to the hospital
for unrelated reasons.

989
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,390
I actually went because
I had pancreatitis.

990
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,803
I had an emergency in my
stomach, that's what it was.

991
00:53:13,803 --> 00:53:18,590
I had pancreatitis and
I was flown down to DC

992
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,140
actually it was an ambulance
drive the second time,

993
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,130
which is a six hour drive by the way

994
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,700
in an ambulance very, very uncomfortable.

995
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,500
Six hour drive and I'm in DC,

996
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,917
I'm talking to Daviya,

997
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,180
trying to get her to fall
in love with me.(laughs)

998
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,397
And then comes this doctor who says,

999
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:42,826
"Listen, we have a transplant for you

1000
00:53:42,826 --> 00:53:44,157
"and this one is a match."

1001
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,393
It was my chance to get my life back.

1002
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,840
Everything that the doctors told me

1003
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,803
were unlikely to happen was happening.

1004
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,940
My doctor told me that I had
a one out of a 100% chance

1005
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,910
of surviving the gunshot wound

1006
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,800
and all the rest of the infections

1007
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
and everything that'd
survived from the wound.

1008
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,750
They said less than 1%

1009
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,600
would have been able to survive that.

1010
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:22,799
That's a miracle number.

1011
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,493
I woke up from that transplant,

1012
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,223
weak but with new hope.

1013
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,940
I got that transplant

1014
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,023
August Friday the 13th.

1015
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,620
It was from a young boy who was 13

1016
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,523
from Colorado named Jack.

1017
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,813
He was killed in an automobile accident.

1018
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:00,820
And I think I've always felt
kind of guilty for that.

1019
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,020
Not for his death but

1020
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,330
for the fact that an
innocent person's death

1021
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,820
gave me second chance at life.

1022
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,000
And I certainly wasn't innocent.

1023
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:30,450
And this family wrote me afterwards,

1024
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,240
they didn't know my name.

1025
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,633
The hospital doesn't give out the name,

1026
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,710
but they wrote me and
they told me how Jack was,

1027
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,563
they told me that he
was a football player.

1028
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,732
He had a great personality,
he was popular with everyone.

1029
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:50,523
He was actually a flirt, his mother said,

1030
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,133
irresistible to ladies and
he had so much life in him.

1031
00:55:58,728 --> 00:56:03,728
And she said, now she feels so
blessed that his death means

1032
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,293
that someone else can continue to live.

1033
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,480
And I keep that letter

1034
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:18,163
because for most of my life,

1035
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,337
a big chunk of it at least I
felt like I deserved to die.

1036
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,833
But I can't die now.

1037
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,210
I can't give up because I'm
continuing this kid's life,

1038
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,133
I'm continuing Jack's life.

1039
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,730
And even though I don't think it's fair

1040
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,680
that somebody like me is still living

1041
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,233
and someone like Jack is dead.

1042
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:59,270
I'm gonna use the blessing
that he's given me

1043
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,360
to carry on as much as possible,

1044
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,963
to make as big of a
difference as I possibly can.

1045
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:16,190
But I always feel a slight guilt

1046
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,123
and not only just for Jack but for...

1047
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,470
I see a Facebook post, I see pins,

1048
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:29,410
I see tweets and news articles

1049
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,320
about someone else getting killed,

1050
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,673
shot almost every week.

1051
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,420
And I wonder why these
kids die and I didn't.

1052
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:47,400
I'm alive because Jack,
an innocent young kid died

1053
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,980
and I dealt with,

1054
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,080
I guess this is called a survivor's guilt.

1055
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,300
But there's so many people
who die in the same situation

1056
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,433
you are and don't get me
wrong, I'm not a soldier,

1057
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,590
but when soldiers are on the battlefield

1058
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,740
and they're fighting towards something

1059
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,718
and they're all on the
same level of suffering,

1060
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:12,600
the same risks.

1061
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,240
And for some reason, they come back

1062
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,223
and so many other people die.

1063
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,900
You question whether or not
you were the right choice.

1064
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,213
Was I the right choice to be alive?

1065
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:34,080
I think even now I'm trying
to earn my life still.

1066
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,973
Deserve?

1067
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,903
Deserve is a loaded word.

1068
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,790
I think I'm earning my life now.

1069
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:52,723
I don't think I deserve it, deserve it no.

1070
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,830
But I think it can be used

1071
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,420
and I think that's how I can earn it.

1072
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:03,290
I think that's how I can honor Jack

1073
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,610
because now I can honestly say

1074
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,683
that I am starting to love myself finally.

1075
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,163
And it's not because
anyone else is proud of me.

1076
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:16,223
It's not because anyone
else is applauding me.

1077
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,023
I heard someone say this to me before.

1078
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:26,097
They said, "I think that
the bullet saved your life."

1079
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,263
And when said that it made a lot of sense.

1080
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,700
Maybe it took this,
maybe this was necessary,

1081
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:39,500
maybe this was needed for
me to reach this point

1082
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,850
for me to be able to
effectively impact people.

1083
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,270
It pushes me to keep bettering myself,

1084
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:53,270
it pushes me to make my
story transparent and open.

1085
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,040
'Cause this isn't something
that's easy to talk about.

1086
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,753
I'm making it my mission to talk about.

1087
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,540
I mean, here people ask me to
lay out my biggest failures,

1088
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,833
my biggest moments of shame and guilt,

1089
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,853
my darkest secrets and sins.

1090
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,060
But if I know it's gonna help people,

1091
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:32,560
if I know it's worth something

1092
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:35,943
then I'm willing to take that shame

1093
01:00:35,943 --> 01:00:40,847
and I'm willing to take
that embarrassment.

1094
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:47,370
I'm willing to take that
uncomfortable spotlight

1095
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,310
and I decided, if I'm gonna
change my life mentally,

1096
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:58,773
if I'm gonna change my life spiritually,

1097
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,200
then I'm definitely gonna
change my life physically.

1098
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,983
One of the things they said is,

1099
01:01:04,983 --> 01:01:07,597
"He's always gonna be
addicted to pain medicine.

1100
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,257
"You're always gonna have
neuropathy in your right foot.

1101
01:01:10,257 --> 01:01:11,783
"It's never gonna go away."

1102
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,699
They said that, "All the pain
medicine that we give you,

1103
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:20,317
"they might give him brain damage.

1104
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:23,227
"He might have brain damage,
he might not return mentally."

1105
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,450
All those things were wrong.

1106
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,653
I was taking approximately 60 pills a day.

1107
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,710
I was taking pain medicines,

1108
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:38,090
I took methadone, Dilaudid.

1109
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:41,490
There's another pain
medicine, fentanyl patches.

1110
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:45,560
I had to take tacrolimus
or what's known as Prograf,

1111
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,763
CellCept, prednisone,
pantoprazole, calcitriol.

1112
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,040
Some medicine I can't pronounce,

1113
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,820
some other medicine it starts
with M but it's literally.

1114
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,870
I don't know if the doctor
gave me this to prank me,

1115
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,060
but it's the worst tasting
medicine I've ever had.

1116
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,650
It looks like yellow paint

1117
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:13,243
and I had to swallow it two times a day.

1118
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,850
And it is as bad as
swallowing yellow paint.

1119
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,680
I used it to paint my
name onto a piece of paper

1120
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,707
and it said...

1121
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:29,340
See, I have a nine millimeter
bullet lodged in my sacrum,

1122
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,780
which is pretty much like
my spine near my pelvis.

1123
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,560
And it's not going anywhere,
it's lodged in that spot.

1124
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,260
They told me if they remove
it, I'm probably gonna die.

1125
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,110
So they said, "Let's leave
the bullet right there."

1126
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,940
Actually, I named the
bullet, I forgot about this.

1127
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,740
I named the bullet Byron,

1128
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,930
because I realized it gonna
be there for a long time.

1129
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:53,493
So I named it, fun fact
my bullet's name is Byron.

1130
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,490
I had rehabilitation nurses

1131
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,067
come in and tell me,

1132
01:03:05,067 --> 01:03:07,207
"Oh I'm sorry, you're
not gonna run anymore,

1133
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,080
"you're not gonna build muscle anymore."

1134
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,260
I had showed a picture of it to the doctor

1135
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,433
of how I used to look.

1136
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:14,230
And I had this great picture,

1137
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:16,380
I had a six pack and everything.

1138
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,967
And he said, "Oh, wow, you look great,

1139
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:20,120
"but those days are over."

1140
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,237
I remember him saying that,

1141
01:03:21,237 --> 01:03:23,477
"Those days are over, give it up."

1142
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,640
I went home and I started
doing squats on the bed.

1143
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,420
Of course, I could only do about five.

1144
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,500
No weight, could only do about five.

1145
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,290
And I was determined to get back

1146
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,910
to where I was supposed
to be, to exceed that.

1147
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,750
I was determined I was
gonna get my life back

1148
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,210
in every aspect.

1149
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:47,930
And I had no control over some things,

1150
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:51,330
I couldn't control whose intestines I got

1151
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,550
or how well they were
going to react to me.

1152
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:54,510
And one of the few things

1153
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,983
I was able to control was my body.

1154
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:01,880
I was able to control my muscles,

1155
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,880
I was able to exercise as
much as my body would allow.

1156
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,900
I think the body is the greatest
manifestation of progress.

1157
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,660
You can take someone who has

1158
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:24,430
no muscle tone, no growth, no potential.

1159
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,900
And the same way where you
can take someone's life

1160
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,610
that has no potential, no talent.

1161
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,030
And if everyday you push to
get to where you wanna be,

1162
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:31,983
you can get there.

1163
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:35,050
And every day that I'm able to get up,

1164
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:36,100
and I'm able to lift,

1165
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:39,483
it reminds me that no matter
where I am in my life,

1166
01:04:39,483 --> 01:04:41,363
I can continue to make progress.

1167
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:44,867
I'm in control of how
much progress I make.

1168
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,690
I don't knock any of the
doctors for their estimations.

1169
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,580
It looked like five years,

1170
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,700
it looked like I wasn't
gonna be able to run

1171
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,570
or lift weights,

1172
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,420
it looked like I wasn't
going to have my voice back.

1173
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:59,670
It looked like my mind
wasn't gonna be right.

1174
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,539
It looked like

1175
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:02,783
I was going to suffer
from neuropathy forever.

1176
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,030
It looked like it.

1177
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But this is one of the
times where I'm grateful for

1178
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,450
I suppose the Renegade side of me.

1179
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,930
The same side that's the
most destructive in me

1180
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,430
is the side that sees no limitations

1181
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,850
and whereas before that
was fire and anger,

1182
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:31,193
now it a sees no limitations in faith.

1183
01:05:32,086 --> 01:05:33,843
It sees no limitations in miracle.

1184
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,533
It rebels even against that.

1185
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,720
I won't sprint, I won't
be able to run, why not?

1186
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,423
What happens if I try to do so?

1187
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:50,713
I won't be able to feel my
toes again on my right foot?

1188
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,360
Well, let's see about that.

1189
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,270
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

1190
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:57,670
I'm gonna fight you on that.

1191
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,400
If I'm able to make progress on my body,

1192
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,000
I can make progress or anything.

1193
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:08,360
And Renegade knows that
rules that were given to him

1194
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,700
limitations such as you won't
be able to deadlift anymore,

1195
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,680
you won't be able to run.

1196
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,930
Those rules don't matter,

1197
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,703
those limitations don't matter.

1198
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,623
And I can rebel against those limitations.

1199
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:27,724
I don't have to live by them.

1200
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,070
I can be who I wanna be

1201
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:34,263
and I can get what I wanna
get, despite your limitations.

1202
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,530
So long as Henry Green
is channeling Renegade,

1203
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,328
I think it's a good thing.

1204
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,697
Ever since I was shot

1205
01:06:48,697 --> 01:06:50,480
and I was able to get
my life back on track,

1206
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,760
I made it a personal mission to go

1207
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,190
everywhere I possibly
can and share my story

1208
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,810
and explain to as many people as possible

1209
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:02,100
that you do have this power
and this talent side of you.

1210
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,140
And you can use it for something great,

1211
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,110
you can use it for something good.

1212
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:07,280
And that's what you should focus on doing.

1213
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,433
And I take the ugliest parts of my life,

1214
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:13,440
mainly the parts that
I'm the most ashamed of.

1215
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,220
And I put it out there, I make it open.

1216
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,690
I make it transparent for everyone to see

1217
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:23,770
and I explain my
transition from being there

1218
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:25,083
to being where I am now.

1219
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:32,763
I think for myself,

1220
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,890
my identity is formed
based upon the environment

1221
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:38,723
that I have to adapt to.

1222
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,210
Right now, I think that
I'm at my most whole

1223
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:48,210
but I've always been categorized
in some way or another.

1224
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,030
You know that I was Henry Green,

1225
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:56,841
I was Renegade to somebody
or Stanley Galbraith.

1226
01:07:56,841 --> 01:07:58,400
(laughs)

1227
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,500
That name, or Stanley Galbraith

1228
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,080
or in DC I'm like the miracle patient

1229
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,743
to people I'm different things.

1230
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:13,030
And I think I've come to a
place now where I understand

1231
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:16,550
that all of those different characters

1232
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,950
that other people see are me

1233
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:20,050
and now I'm not gonna work

1234
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,710
to portray myself as one or the other.

1235
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:26,400
I think for the first
time ever since the coma,

1236
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,733
I've accepted that I'm all
one, I'm all these people.

1237
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,590
And I'm going to not fight
to try to be one or the other

1238
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:39,940
and I'm gonna be all of
myself everywhere I am.

1239
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,700
From the New Haven, I'm
not just gonna be Renegade,

1240
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,600
I'm also going to be Henry Green.

1241
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,567
I'm probably never gonna be
Stanley Galbraith anywhere.

1242
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:47,650
(laughs)

1243
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:52,030
But I am all of these things,

1244
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,240
I'm all of these experiences

1245
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,610
and it would be foolish
of me to try to hide one,

1246
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:59,723
take one away or bring
one up and push one down.

1247
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,340
It's not sides of me.

1248
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,950
A lot of people think
it's this side of you

1249
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:06,783
or that side of you.

1250
01:09:06,783 --> 01:09:07,616
It's not sides of me,

1251
01:09:07,616 --> 01:09:09,900
it's just it's all me.

1252
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,302
It's all one person.

1253
01:09:11,302 --> 01:09:13,700
(moody blues music)

1254
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,563
And I'm finally whole.

1255
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,603
My life is all one life.

1256
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:22,203
When someone gets shot,

1257
01:09:22,203 --> 01:09:25,110
everyone wants to believe
that either they are innocent

1258
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,380
or if it's their loved one,

1259
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:28,490
they wanna believe that they're innocent.

1260
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,660
And it's because especially

1261
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,780
when it's covered by a big news story,

1262
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:37,110
you're able to get a full
picture of an individual.

1263
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:41,520
Many times when we get a
picture of a victim or criminal,

1264
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,160
when you get the picture of the criminal,

1265
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,300
the only side that you get,

1266
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,680
the only story that
you get is their crime.

1267
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,150
Their crime and possibly a
few negative characteristics

1268
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:54,233
that are meant to explain the crime.

1269
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:56,330
You know what I'm saying for instance,

1270
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,017
for the shooter, they say,

1271
01:09:58,017 --> 01:10:02,090
"Oh, he was gang affiliated,
and he shot him and ran."

1272
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:04,060
And that's all the information

1273
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,870
that we get about the shooter.

1274
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,990
But for myself, and probably the reason

1275
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:11,310
why so many people feel
compassionate towards my situation,

1276
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:14,680
is that they were able to
fully understand me afterwards.

1277
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,990
They were able to get stories,

1278
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,273
stories from my family's,
stories from friends

1279
01:10:18,273 --> 01:10:20,470
and people who I've worked with,

1280
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,200
they were able to get a full picture.

1281
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,430
I couldn't just be a criminal,

1282
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:26,630
they couldn't make a two
dimensional picture of me

1283
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:30,153
and because of that, now
I'm suddenly a victim,

1284
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:36,220
instead of simply a black
on black crime casualty,

1285
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:39,540
now I'm a victim, because
you can put a face on it,

1286
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,140
you can put a personality on it.

1287
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,140
And the only thing that's different

1288
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,790
that I did with the
shooters, I put a personality

1289
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,450
and I put a face and
I put memories on him.

1290
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,093
So now, he's a victim too.

1291
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:56,440
And not everyone will view things this way

1292
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,000
because we're all we're
all a little biased.

1293
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,580
I know that I'm both a saint and sinner,

1294
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:06,570
as is anyone else.

1295
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:09,380
And I think that we have
this natural tendency

1296
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,500
to paint someone either
a saint or a sinner

1297
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,320
because then it's easier
to hate to love them.

1298
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,910
It's easier to do that.

1299
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:19,130
It's harder to look at the
complex picture of someone

1300
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:22,950
and see everything that's great about them

1301
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,530
and then at the same time,

1302
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,230
see their mistakes and see their flaws.

1303
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:28,730
I think Have a unique situation

1304
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,443
where I was able to survive a situation

1305
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:32,240
where I would have died.

1306
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,560
And I probably would have been labeled

1307
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,430
as either a saint or a sinner.

1308
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:39,530
But I was able to survive and
then explain my own story.

1309
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:42,600
I was able to paint a gray picture,

1310
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,790
instead of a black and white
picture, and we're all gray.

1311
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,790
The shooter is gray, the victim is gray.

1312
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:53,163
I guess my compassion for
the shooter comes from,

1313
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,003
I think honesty with myself.

1314
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:01,420
The only reason why you can
really, truly hate someone

1315
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,060
is if you think you're nothing like them.

1316
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,743
If you don't understand them.

1317
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,913
But if I'm gonna be honest with myself,

1318
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,990
he's very similar to me.

1319
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,160
We both were really angry and frustrated

1320
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,910
with the situation that we were in.

1321
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,900
We both handled our anger

1322
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,510
and our frustration in the wrong way.

1323
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,890
I'm sure this kid grew up in
the same type of environment

1324
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:26,050
that I did, where he realized

1325
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,990
that he didn't have the
things that he wanted

1326
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:31,780
or the things that he
felt as if he should have.

1327
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:36,710
Maybe he's lacking some type
of love or pride in himself

1328
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,883
that he should naturally have

1329
01:12:37,883 --> 01:12:40,610
or that someone should
have instilled in him.

1330
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:41,500
So now he's going out,

1331
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,950
he's trying to find a way
to be proud of himself.

1332
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:46,450
He's going out and he's
trying to find a way

1333
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:49,420
to accept himself and
to take back the things

1334
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,473
that he didn't have.

1335
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,409
And I did the same thing

1336
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:58,050
and it will be nothing
short of hypocritical

1337
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,400
for me to blame this kid

1338
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,460
or to to make a monster out of him

1339
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,803
when I did the same thing.

1340
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:09,363
And I really wish I could just
meet him and tell him that.

1341
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,300
I wish I could meet him

1342
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,250
and talk to him about everything
that he's been through

1343
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,310
so that we could find out

1344
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,410
how to channel him in the right direction.

1345
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,390
I wish he knew he was forgiven.

1346
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,182
After a few years,

1347
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:31,182
I've narrowed down my thoughts
of who the shooter might be.

1348
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:37,499
And from what I know,

1349
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:40,893
he's in jail right now for something else.

1350
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:45,280
And, you know, looking at where his life

1351
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,970
probably is right now,

1352
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,160
actually, all the people that
I've hurt may have shot me

1353
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,763
or are in jail or have died.

1354
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:57,893
Whereas, me five years after the shooting,

1355
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:59,960
I have a full time job

1356
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,770
and I'm about to graduate from college.

1357
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,330
I'm married with my own apartment,

1358
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,807
and I don't really think I'm
a loser in this situation.

1359
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:15,867
I would love to shine some light onto him.

1360
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:22,787
If I could, and this is what I want

1361
01:14:22,787 --> 01:14:25,110
and I knew this initially,

1362
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:27,113
when I first said, I forgive him.

1363
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,560
I know and I knew in my heart

1364
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,770
that I was gonna be able to run into him

1365
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:35,853
and have a conversation
with him about this.

1366
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,453
I want to,

1367
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:43,133
I know that is destiny.

1368
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:48,720
I know that the only way
to start changing New Haven

1369
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,203
is to take steps like this.

1370
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,930
I wanna meet with him

1371
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:58,623
and tell him to his
face that I forgive him.

1372
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,803
And then I wanna help him
get his life on track.

1373
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,943
I wanna personally guide
him and help him to do that.

1374
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,823
I want to get therapy with him.

1375
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,283
I'm sure we both need therapy.

1376
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,603
Shooting somebody is probably
as traumatic as getting shot.

1377
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,623
If I could meet him,

1378
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,290
I would love to be able to meet with him,

1379
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:34,503
talk with him and share
our story together.

1380
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:41,980
I think a shooter and his
victim meeting together

1381
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,830
to forgive one another is more powerful

1382
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,083
than a victim jailing a shooter.

1383
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:51,643
I think it creates more change.

1384
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,963
Sounds weird, but I
think it definitely does.

1385
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,620
The thing about New Haven,

1386
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,930
the curse about New Haven and why

1387
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:08,930
the cycle of violence
continues to be perpetuated

1388
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,990
is there's a nonstop tit for that.

1389
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,963
Someone gets shot,

1390
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,300
someone over here gets angry,

1391
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,690
shoots the person who shot that person.

1392
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:24,393
Someone over here gets
angry shoots the person

1393
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:28,020
that shot that person and it never stops

1394
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,273
until all family members are dead.

1395
01:16:31,905 --> 01:16:34,260
Then their children do it,
then their cousins do it

1396
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,533
and their friends do it.

1397
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,063
The only way stops is
if a person forgives.

1398
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,918
And I wanna start that.

1399
01:16:45,918 --> 01:16:48,918
(moody blues music)

1400
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,680
I can see now that without that bullet,

1401
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,860
without Byron, the bullet, there's no way

1402
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,663
that I would have brought all
these worlds into one place.

1403
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:07,013
A bullet saved me man.

1404
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,990
Sometimes it's the worst things in life

1405
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:15,720
that bring the greatest
and most profound change.

1406
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,883
Necessary change.

1407
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,043
It's the climax to the plot.

1408
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,160
The climax to the plot makes you nervous

1409
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:26,893
and it sounds horrible,

1410
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,863
but it's needed for the happy ending.

1411
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,235
It's needed.

1412
01:17:32,235 --> 01:17:35,860
(moody blues music)

1413
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,740
It's hard to see that in the
middle of the climax of course

1414
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:42,483
but it's needed.

1415
01:18:17,466 --> 01:18:20,466
(moody blues music)

1416
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:44,400
The dude who wakes up
with the gangster face

1417
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,030
calls me crying in the middle of night.

1418
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,970
It's like two o'clock in the morning,

1419
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,610
he calls me bawling.

1420
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,540
He just keeps repeating
the same thing over

1421
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:52,960
and I'm like, "Yo what's good, you okay?"

1422
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,560
And he says, "How did you do it?

1423
01:18:55,987 --> 01:18:56,820
"How did you do it?

1424
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,920
"Henry how did you do it?"

1425
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,260
And keeps crying and asking

1426
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,850
that same question over and over.

1427
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,057
He says, "How did you forgive him?

1428
01:19:02,057 --> 01:19:03,387
"How did you change?

1429
01:19:03,387 --> 01:19:06,600
"I wanna change, I wanna
change like you did."

1430
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,670
And out of all the things that
I did that was hard for me,

1431
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:10,473
I had to learn how to walk again.

1432
01:19:13,671 --> 01:19:14,686
I had to do everything over,

1433
01:19:14,686 --> 01:19:16,403
really I had to do everything over,

1434
01:19:16,403 --> 01:19:18,310
I wasn't supposed to survive
and nothing like that.

1435
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:20,160
How to get my life back.

1436
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,015
You know what I'm saying,

1437
01:19:21,015 --> 01:19:22,823
I had to try to get a
professional life started.

1438
01:19:22,823 --> 01:19:26,890
And out of everything that
I had to fight and get,

1439
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:28,650
I think that was my
greatest accomplishment

1440
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,970
because I realized at that point in time,

1441
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:32,000
and I want y'all to remember this

1442
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,050
whenever you trying to stay good,

1443
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,890
whenever you're trying to

1444
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:36,410
continue to do something
positive, people are watching you.

1445
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,400
And it's always the ones
that are trying to plow you

1446
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:41,701
that are watching you.

1447
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,440
The ones that seem like
they hating are watching

1448
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,580
and they're hoping that you'll continue

1449
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,017
being that good person
'cause you know what?

1450
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:51,620
You are their last hope in the world.

1451
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,940
You're the last shot of seeing something

1452
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,403
actually get out of here, positive.

1453
01:19:59,552 --> 01:20:01,113
And in that moment, when I realized

1454
01:20:01,113 --> 01:20:05,960
that I cracked that heart
that had all this callous

1455
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,330
and this pain on it.

1456
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,970
When I realized I had broke that open,

1457
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,300
I think that was the
greatest accomplishment

1458
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,849
I could have ever gotten,
I could have ever received.

1459
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:16,650
Because I realized that
at that point in time,

1460
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,360
the way I live my life makes a difference,

1461
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,280
an actual a difference on other people.

1462
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,247
You know, I know a lot of people say,

1463
01:20:21,247 --> 01:20:22,210
"Oh, you're making a difference."

1464
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:23,830
But I was able to see it

1465
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:26,220
and that reminded me every day

1466
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:29,370
that I have to live my life
like the people are watching me

1467
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:30,397
because they are.

1468
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,619
And I think that was my
greatest accomplishment.

1469
01:20:33,619 --> 01:20:35,046
That's it, thank you.

1470
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:37,546
(crowd claps)
