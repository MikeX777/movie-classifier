00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,061
Billy, stay here,
all right?

183
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:06,392
Just going to stay
in the car?

184
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:10,126
All right.
Stay here.

185
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:16,167
Jackie.
Jackie! Hey!

186
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:23,040
Come on, Jackie.
Hey. Hey, come on.

187
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,337
Man:
There. Hey, Mikey.

188
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,384
Give your daddy
a kiss.

189
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:27,308
Come over here.
Come on.

190
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,842
Excuse me, but you
haven't seen

191
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,276
this kid but twice
since he's been born.

192
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,110
Now all of a sudden,
you want to come around here

193
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:35,046
and play daddy?

194
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,751
Jesus,
he's my kid, too,

195
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:38,452
for Christ's sakes.
Come on.

196
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,153
That's not what
you said to me

197
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,954
when I told you
that I was pregnant.

198
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,213
Fuck you, Billy.

199
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,430
Whoa! Why you got
to talk to me like that

200
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:51,658
in front of the kid?

201
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,903
Why? Because you are just
such a fucking asshole.

202
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,369
Don't you come
stepping into my life

203
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,227
and telling me that
you care about my son.

204
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:00,566
Hey, "our" son.

205
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,911
Tony, voice-over:
Dig. Like last new year's night,

206
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:05,967
when the whole scene
shown bright

207
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:10,036
and all the goons
was stalking their prey.

208
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,946
The cold was pure crime
on them neon lights

209
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,108
and all the tricks
were doomed to pay.

210
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:19,116
Crime suddenly begun
soon as daughters made sons.

211
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,860
Some of them's
only 5 years old.

212
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:25,137
You know, there's been
many, many a night

213
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,432
I had to settle for
a bite off of some old...

214
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,798
Moldy roll.

215
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,836
Seen your
father lately?

216
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,237
He's dead.

217
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:43,206
He's dead?
You sure?

218
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,508
Yeah, I'm sure.

219
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,714
Positive?

220
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:52,282
Absolutely.
Absolutely positive.

221
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,447
A fucking deadbeat.

222
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:04,156
A fucking prick
is what he was.

223
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,270
Are you hungry?
You want to go

224
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:18,871
get a slice of pizza
or something?

225
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:21,442
Come on.
Take a walk with me.

226
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:22,841
I'll buy you a slice,
all right?

227
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:25,182
That's all right.
I'm good.

228
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,807
Like you got something
better to do?

229
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:31,912
Come on. Take a walk
with me, bro.

230
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:36,079
Ok. But don't
call me that.

231
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,860
What can I do
you fellas?

232
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,218
Let me get two slices
and a coke.

233
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,986
What you want
to drink, bro?

234
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,164
Dr. pepper.

235
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,331
Dr. pepper?
You need something

236
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,489
with vitamin c, yo.

237
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,296
Hey, let me get
an orange drink with that.

238
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,957
Man: 10 minutes
on the pizza.

239
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,795
Yeah. No problem.

240
00:13:58,835 --> 00:13:59,525
What?

241
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,995
Look at you.

242
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:03,844
Wipe your nose.

243
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,839
Thanks.

244
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,340
You know
you got to eat, bro.

245
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,271
Feed a cold,
starve a fever.

246
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:09,976
That's what they say.

247
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:12,407
I fucking told you
not to call me that.

248
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:15,212
Now, see,
look what you did.

249
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:17,284
Are you stupid
or what?

250
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:19,422
Why the fuck you got
to talk to me like that?

251
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,817
You put me back
another 10 minutes.

252
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,039
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,262
Yeah, sorry.
It does nothing for me.

254
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:25,485
"You're sorry."
You know what? Get out.

255
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,819
What? We just want
some pizza, man.

256
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,523
Oh, get a fucking
haircut.

257
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:30,964
Two of you
are knuckleheads.

258
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:33,432
Aah! What the fuck!

259
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,487
Fuck, man!

260
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:37,134
Torch: Say it
to my fucking face.

261
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,599
Who's stupid now,
motherfucker?

262
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:42,258
Wait a minute.
We got to go.

263
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,566
We got to go.
The cops are coming.

264
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,097
What are you
talking about?

265
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,581
What cops?

266
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,065
The ones
behind me, yo.

267
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:50,603
Holy shit.

268
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:55,316
Officers: Hold it!
Hold it! Police!

269
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:58,335
Stop right there!
Police officer! Stop!

270
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:09,947
Get the fuck
out of the way!

271
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,294
Torch: Wait up, man.
Wait up.

272
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,373
How did you know
those cops were coming?

273
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:27,098
I got eyes in the back
of my head.

274
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,503
20/20 Mike. That's me.

275
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:30,485
What's the matter
with you?

276
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:31,468
What? Are you
fucking crazy?

277
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,543
You're trying to
get us busted again?

278
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,110
We just got out,
man.

279
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,338
Yeah, well,
I may be crazy,

280
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:37,383
but I ain't stupid.

281
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,406
What do you mean
"we" just got out?

282
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:39,421
We ain't together.

283
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:40,432
Come on. Don't be
like that, bro.

284
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:41,443
Don't fucking
call me that.

285
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:42,407
Just because
my old man

286
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:43,414
was fucking
your mother

287
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:44,575
don't make us
brothers.

288
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,792
Oh, wait a minute.

289
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,003
Why you got to talk
about my mother, huh?

290
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,214
Why you got to talk
about my mom?

291
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:49,248
Ha ha ha!

292
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,352
Fucking asshole.

293
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:51,452
You fucking put
your hands up to me again,

294
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,552
I'll throw you
a fucking beating

295
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:53,915
you'll never forget.

296
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,523
I'm sorry, all right?

297
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:56,524
Look. You're
pretty good

298
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,655
with the smitties,
right?

299
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:00,459
Maybe we could make
some money together.

300
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,431
Doing what?

301
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,928
This and that.
A little flim,

302
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,429
a little flam,
you know.

303
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,398
I don't know.

304
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,609
What? Like you got

305
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,820
something better
to do, Mr. Williams?

306
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,031
Cut me a break with
that Mr. Williams shit.

307
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,195
Ok. Whatever the
fuck your name is.

308
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:14,443
Billy.

309
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,637
Billy?

310
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:17,498
Yeah. Billy.

311
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:21,006
You want to make
some money or not?

312
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,241
Ok.

313
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:46,097
What you want
from me, Max?

314
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:47,269
You know what I want?

315
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,426
I want you to do what
you fucking promised.

316
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:49,604
It's not that
fucking complicated.

317
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,101
You say you're going
to do something,

318
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:51,972
you do it.

319
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,629
It's not my fault.

320
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,536
Whose fault is it?
Mine?

321
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:55,497
No.

322
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:57,204
And I bet you
won't tell her

323
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,135
you won't take her
trick-or-treating.

324
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,070
Maxine!

325
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,514
Maxine what?

326
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,339
I knew this shit
was going to happen.

327
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,344
It's the same
fucking shit

328
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:06,825
that happened
last year.

329
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,309
Look. I got business
to take care of.

330
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:10,384
You're going to have to
take her this year.

331
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,732
You know what?

332
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,082
She doesn't
want me to take her.

333
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,424
She wants her father
to take her.

334
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:16,418
All right?
She's a little girl.

335
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,390
Halloween
is important to her.

336
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,618
I know that.

337
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,692
Think I don't
know that?

338
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,159
Why don't you
fucking act like it?

339
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,628
She's not going to
be little forever.

340
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,627
Where you going?

341
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,128
Where you going?

342
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,629
Going to pick her up
from school.

343
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,201
This is bullshit!

344
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,669
Now just stop it,
all right?

345
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:41,710
Max...You know
the game.

346
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,112
I'll be back.

347
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:51,283
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

348
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:03,062
Just do what
you got to do.

349
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:08,361
Come here.
Don't be scared.

350
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:09,733
It'll be ok.

351
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:12,161
You go get precious.

352
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,996
Tell her
daddy's sorry.

353
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,072
Will you do that
for me?

354
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:20,274
Yeah.

355
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:28,587
I'll do that
for you.

356
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,505
I'll tell her
you're sorry.

357
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,316
Maxine:
I don't know why

358
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,120
I'm with your
sorry ass anyway.

00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,372
You can make it, bro.

539
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,173
I told you not to
call me that.

540
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,375
You sure we're
going to be safe up here?

541
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,808
Yeah, I'm sure.

542
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,880
Torch: Huh? Oh, shit.
This is it?

543
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,846
This is your
fucking hideout?

544
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:46,154
Yeah, yeah,
this is it.

545
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,885
Go ahead. Make
yourself at home.

546
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:51,891
You sure Manny won't
come looking for us here?

547
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:52,734
Yeah, I'm sure.

548
00:28:52,728 --> 00:28:53,888
You positive?

549
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:55,255
I'm telling you,
absolutely.

550
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:57,503
Absolutely positive.

551
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:58,588
Let me tell you something.

552
00:28:58,587 --> 00:28:59,677
It looks like
quite a few people found

553
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:00,756
your little
fucking hideaway here.

554
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,427
Will you just go ahead
and sit down?

555
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:07,896
Yeah, yeah.
I'll do that.

556
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:10,743
Let me tell you
something else.

557
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,410
I sure as shit ain't taking
my shoes off in this joint.

558
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:14,739
God forbid, I get
fucking aids.

559
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:17,884
What are you so fucking
worried about, huh?

560
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,960
I don't know.

561
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,053
What if Manny
and his boys find us?

562
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,278
What about that, huh?

563
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:23,082
<i> Mierda,</i> look it,
I told you.

564
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,353
This place is like
fucking fort knox.

565
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:27,522
Nobody comes
in our out

566
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,199
unless they know
the way.

567
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:30,893
All right? Me
and my man Tony,

568
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:32,259
we used to hide out
here all the time.

569
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:34,817
What you keep saying.
Are you sure nobody saw us?

570
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:38,256
Yeah. Yeah.

571
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:43,832
Jesus Christ. Damn
place is a mess.

572
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,404
No shit.

573
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:47,072
I don't know
if I like this.

574
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:48,149
I think we should blow.

575
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,232
I think we should get
the fuck out of here.

576
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:50,667
And do what? What,
you want to ride

577
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:52,101
the fucking subway
till somebody spots us?

578
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:53,166
No. We take our chances
on the street.

579
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,523
We're better off.
I'm telling you.

580
00:29:54,523 --> 00:29:55,873
No. Forget about it.
We got half the dealers

581
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,165
in the city looking
for us probably,

582
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:58,106
not to mention the cops.

583
00:29:58,109 --> 00:29:59,039
We got to do some
fucking thing.

584
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:00,044
At least get
out of New York.

585
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:02,505
To Jersey, Philly,
maybe Miami.

586
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:04,054
I hear the weather's nice.

587
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:05,458
Miami?

588
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:06,875
Miami? What are
you, fucking crazy?

589
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:08,824
Manny's got connections
up the ass

590
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:09,479
on the east coast.

591
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:11,116
We got to go
out west.

592
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,520
California, Seattle,
maybe.

593
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,791
Maybe this guy Tony,
the friend you called,

594
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:16,519
maybe we could sell
the shit to him.

595
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,124
No way. No way.

596
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,785
Tony's out
of the life now.

597
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:21,133
Let me tell you something.

598
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,387
Once you got a taste
of the life, that's it.

599
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,964
Once in the life,
always in the life, Mikey.

600
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:28,203
Not my man Tony,
man. He's out.

601
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,399
Lucky motherfucker.

602
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:33,835
Oh, we used to come
up here all the time

603
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:34,997
back in the day.

604
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:36,474
Me, him,
fucking Freddie.

605
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:38,412
Fucking Freddie nine lives.

606
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,767
A piece of work, he is.

607
00:30:39,774 --> 00:30:41,144
Catch that motherfucker,
throw him off a roof.

608
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:43,413
Freddie: Aah!
I don't know nothing.

609
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:44,541
I don't know nothing.

610
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:46,375
I swear I don't know
anything.

611
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,810
I swear to God, please!

612
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:50,354
Come on, Freddie,
who was it?

613
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,839
Come on.

614
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,329
Freddie: I don't know
nothing, man. I swear to God.

615
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,819
You don't tell me,
I'm going to throw you

616
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,590
off this fucking roof.
Tell me.

617
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,918
Please, Manny, please.
I don't know anything.

618
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,463
Oh, God, no!

619
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,988
Hey, Buddha, don't cats
usually land on their feet?

620
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:06,034
Yeah, but at this
height, I don't know.

621
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:09,229
No, Manny, please.
Don't drop me, Manny.

622
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:11,872
Don't kill me. Not like
this, Manny, please.

623
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:12,827
Drop him.

624
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,374
No! No! No!

625
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:15,618
It was Mike!

626
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:16,868
It was Mike,
20/20 Mike!

627
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,500
Come on, Freddie,
stop fucking around.

628
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,144
Come on.
The other guy, huh?

629
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,568
It was some crazy white boy
with long hair,

630
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:23,813
a dope fiend.

631
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:25,037
I swear that's all
I know, Manny.

632
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:28,312
Oh, my God, don't...

633
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:31,581
20/20. Ain't that
Tony's boy?

634
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:35,248
Yo, Manny. I ain't seen
this cat in, like, years,

635
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,851
you know what
I'm saying?

636
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:38,922
Freddie: I swear.
Don't drop me.

637
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,020
I swear to God!
Please.

638
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:42,552
It's ok, Tony.

639
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,056
Really, it's ok.

640
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,557
Freddie: Oh, my God,
don't kill me, Manny.

641
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,619
Please, not like this!

642
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:48,626
Ruffhouse, Buddha,

643
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:50,028
why don't you take
Freddie downstairs

644
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:50,989
and hang out, huh?

645
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,626
Me and Tony
got to talk.

646
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,600
I can't believe he fucking
left us hanging, man.

647
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:56,198
Cocksucker said the job
would be a cinch.

648
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,499
Said it would be easy.
Now look at us

649
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,270
sitting here
in a fucking firetrap.

650
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:00,248
It would have
been a cinch

651
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,231
if you'd have chilled
the fuck out.

652
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:02,336
Don't fucking start
with me.

653
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:03,436
I can't believe you
fucking shot those guys.

654
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:04,536
How many fucking times
are you going to say it?

655
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,009
You fucking shot
two kids, man.

656
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,867
I can't believe that.

657
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:08,044
Forget about it,
will you?

658
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,441
What's done is done.

659
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,584
Yeah.

660
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:14,607
You came to me
about a year ago.

661
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:15,912
You asked
for your own franchise.

662
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:17,613
I gave it to you,
and what happens?

663
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:19,884
Is this how you show
your fucking appreciation?

664
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:20,912
Manny, you got to
believe--

665
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:21,876
shut the fuck up!

666
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:23,653
Just keep on talking.

667
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,121
Keep on talking.

668
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,649
Freddie: Don't hit me--ohh!

669
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:31,115
Now, I know
this motherfucker

670
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,393
set me up.

671
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,620
Now, I know he's
responsible for Hector.

672
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,585
All I want to know is

673
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:38,563
when, where, why,
what, who.

674
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,112
Come on.

675
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:41,663
I got to the hotel,
all right?

676
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:44,425
[Cell phone ringing]

677
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:52,436
Yeah.

678
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,610
Yeah, baby.

679
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:56,118
No.

680
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,635
Look, Max, I'm kind of
tied up right now, ok?

681
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,614
How's your hand, bro?

682
00:32:58,611 --> 00:32:59,981
Stop calling me
that.

683
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,409
I ain't
your brother.

684
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,353
So it's like that now?

685
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,677
You bet your ass
it is.

686
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,522
You're a sick man,
Mr. Williams.

687
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,647
I told you
not to call me that.

688
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,351
Yep. You're
a very sick man.

689
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,153
I'm not sick.

690
00:33:12,154 --> 00:33:14,044
Just got a cold,

691
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:15,918
and my fucking
hand's killing me.

692
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:19,185
Come on, Tony.
Where the fuck are you?

693
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:21,933
I think I know where
they are, Manny.

694
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:23,129
That's good, Tony.

695
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,230
Now we're going to
talk about

696
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,601
how you should handle it.

697
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,500
Me?

698
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,930
Yeah, you.

699
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,534
I can't
do that, man.

700
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:32,285
Why is that?

701
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:34,036
I ain't never killed
nobody before, man.

702
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:35,738
Well, guess what, Tony.

703
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,439
There's a first time
for everything.

704
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,282
What?

705
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,340
It's your product
we're talking about here.

706
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,546
It's your responsibility.

707
00:33:44,547 --> 00:33:48,547
You wanted to be
your own boss, right?

708
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:51,471
Guess what.

709
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,389
You got to pay the cost
if you want to be the boss.

710
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:59,528
You take that with you.

711
00:34:01,428 --> 00:34:03,018
Fuck this sitting around

712
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:04,596
waiting for your friend
to show up.

713
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:06,194
God forbid, Manny
and his boys find us.

714
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:07,782
Forget it. They'll fucking
have us for breakfast.

715
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,370
Hold up. Hold up.
What the fuck is that?

716
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:10,369
What?

717
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,470
Listen.

718
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:12,441
What the fuck
is that?

719
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:13,398
I don't know.
Maybe it's your friend.

720
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:14,366
No. That's
something else.

721
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:15,343
I know I've heard
that sound before.

722
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:16,671
So what are you
asking me for?

723
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:17,635
I don't know--

724
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:19,612
shh! Shh! Wait.

725
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:23,081
Oh, shit!

726
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:24,138
Fuck!

727
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,405
That's a fucking rat, man.

728
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:26,642
Don't do
that shit, man!

729
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,976
I'm telling you,
that's a fucking rat, man.

730
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,487
I hate rats.

731
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:42,391
I can't stand
them shits.

732
00:34:42,392 --> 00:34:44,262
I remember I was
dating this girl.

733
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,730
She lived down
by mill basin--

734
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,258
candy brown.

735
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,262
Bitch was fine, bro.

736
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:49,503
Told you not
to call me--

737
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:51,197
I mean, fine.

738
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:52,628
This chick was so fine,
I spent all the bread

739
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,632
I could get my hands on

740
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,433
trying to get
into her panties.

741
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:57,234
Took her to coney island,
the aquarium, the movies.

742
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:58,666
Any place in Brooklyn
I thought she might give it up,

743
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,770
that's where I
would take her, right?

744
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:02,642
So after we had gone out
a few times--

745
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,410
I don't know to this date
how I knew,

746
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,138
but I could tell
she had finally decided

747
00:35:06,143 --> 00:35:07,513
to give me some, right?

748
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:09,611
So, we had gone
to the movies

749
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:11,533
over on church Avenue,

750
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:13,451
and when the flick was over,
she asked me to walk her home,

751
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,480
so I go like a bat.

752
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:16,154
So, we start walking,
talking,

753
00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:17,622
shooting the breeze,
you know.

754
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,150
And bing bing!

755
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:21,424
My 20/20 start going off
like crazy.

756
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,522
It was like I could feel
all the fellas around her way,

757
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:24,664
they were checking
me out, you know,

758
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:25,658
like, "who's this chump?

759
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,659
What's she doing
with him," right?

760
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:29,661
So, we finally get
to her building,

761
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:31,163
and it's all run-down
and shit.

762
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:32,664
I'm like, "what the fuck
is a chick this fine

763
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,566
doing living in a place
like this?"

764
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,467
<i> Mierda,</i> she was fine as wine.
I'm telling you,

765
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,569
dress her up
in garbage bags,

766
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,669
put fucking TV dinners
on her head,

767
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,551
you could not hide
this kind of beauty,

768
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,435
and after I'd taken
her out all them times?

769
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,511
Said I was going to
get these panties.

770
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,579
I mean, I was very serious
about this pussy, ok?

771
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,708
Is there a point
to this story?

772
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,653
Oh, yeah, check it out,
I forgot.

773
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,719
We had stopped to get some
bacardi on the way, right?

774
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,749
When we get to her apartment
on the fourth floor,

775
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,815
that shit was hooked up.

776
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,192
Top to bottom,
all exotic and whatnot.

777
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:04,161
The bitch got beads hanging
over the bedroom door,

778
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,590
different colored
light bulbs in the ceiling,

779
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:07,694
and pillows on the floor--
that type of shit.

780
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:10,196
Yeah, she lit up a joint,
some incense,

781
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:11,848
asked me to
make some drinks

782
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:13,499
while she goes
and gets comfortable.

783
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,801
[Speaks spanish]

784
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:19,774
I made it. I made it
to mill basin alive.

785
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,123
I'm going to fuck
the finest girl

786
00:36:21,123 --> 00:36:22,473
I ever seen
in my life, right?

787
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:24,705
So, I make the drinks.

788
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,610
One for me, right?

789
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:28,541
One for her.

790
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:30,406
I'm sitting on the floor.

791
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:32,214
I'm sipping my drink.
I'm taking it all in, right?

792
00:36:32,215 --> 00:36:34,915
The lights, the reefer,
the incense--

793
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,647
bling bing bing!

794
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,722
My 20/20 goes off
again, right?

795
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,590
It's like I could feel
something in the room.

796
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,659
So, I go to put
my drink down, right?

797
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:46,789
The shit spills over.

798
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:47,922
Fucking floor was
slanted, bro.

799
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:49,487
No lie, the shit
was like this.

800
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:52,355
So, now I'm trying
to clean up my mess,

801
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:53,664
and I hear
this scratching sound

802
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55,865
on the floor behind me.

803
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,497
I turn around.

804
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:00,092
I see this rat.

805
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:01,666
Go on, yo, a fucking rat
this fucking big.

806
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:03,771
Swear to God, it was
as big as your fucking head.

807
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:06,543
Ahh, I can't stand
them shits.

808
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:07,842
I'm telling you, man,
that shit blew my mind.

809
00:37:07,843 --> 00:37:09,783
I mean, I couldn't
concentrate on nothing else

810
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:12,748
for the whole rest
of the night.

811
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:14,213
See, what happened was,
when I was little,

812
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:15,654
my sister Debbie,
she got bit by a rat.

813
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,678
She was only, what,
2 or 3 years old at the time.

814
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:19,724
I didn't know it then,

815
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:20,747
but I kept that shit
locked up

816
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:23,222
in the back of my mind.

817
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,217
Like, in my subconscience,
you know?

818
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:27,992
So when the chick
came out of the bathroom--

819
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,471
I mean, all ready
to go, man,

820
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:30,955
looking finer than
a motherfucker--

821
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,300
pussy? Furthest thing
from my mind.

About time, yo.
Here he comes.

824
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:07,464
We got to get out
of here, Mike.

825
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:08,587
Shut up. I'm trying
to think of something.

826
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:10,032
While you're doing that,
I'm bleeding

827
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,456
like a stuck pig. I got
to take a piss--

828
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:13,361
ow, ow, ow!

829
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:14,562
You fuck!

831
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,601
Yo, Mikey!

832
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:25,797
Fuck.

833
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,188
Yo, Mike.

834
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,646
Ok. I'm going to go
up on the roof.

835
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,686
I'm coming with you.

836
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:46,719
No way you're
leaving me by myself.

837
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,174
No. You move
around too much,

838
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:49,624
you'll only make
yourself bleed more.

839
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,356
Are you stupid?

840
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:53,361
Don't call me stupid
one more fucking time!

841
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:54,803
Ok, I'm sorry, ok?

842
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,657
Tony: Yo, Mike.

843
00:38:56,665 --> 00:39:00,665
Yo, Mike, you there?

844
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:04,599
Where you at, baby?

845
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:06,704
I don't know, Mike.
I don't know this guy.

846
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:07,936
How many times
I got to tell you?

847
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,510
He's a friend of mine.

848
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:10,968
You keep saying that.
Big deal.

849
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,435
He ain't no
fucking friend of mine.

850
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:13,744
Ok.

851
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:19,721
Ha ha ha!

853
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:30,889
Ok. Keep it out,
all right?

854
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:32,693
Now, don't let him leave,

855
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:34,594
and whatever you do,

856
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,825
don't fucking shoot him.

857
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,330
Ok?

858
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:40,661
I'm going to go up
on the roof.

859
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,396

Goddamn, this place
is fucked up.

of the floor, slick.

00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:00,998
Empty out your pockets
on the table there

873
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:02,606
and be very, very
careful.

874

Careful is
my middle name, man.

875
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,735
Just don't shoot
a brother is all I'm saying.

876
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:08,633
Just so long
as the brother

00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:10,507
keeps his hands
where I can see them.

878
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,618
It's all I got, chief.

879
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:23,823
I hate carrying this thing.

880
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:25,235
off my case, you know
what I'm saying?

Hey, I ain't interested
in your life story, pal.

and keep your
fucking hands up.

884

do you want?

How the fuck
should I know?

00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:48,988
Didn't I hear
two people up here?

890
00:41:48,987 --> 00:41:49,947
Who gives a fuck
what you heard?

891
00:41:49,947 --> 00:41:51,697
Look, I'm just
trying to make sure

892
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:53,448
I'm in the right place.
That's all I'm saying.

893
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,850
Now, he called
my old lady,

894
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:56,251
said he was trying to
find his sister Debbie.

895
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:57,652
I just want to see if I
can help a brother out.

896
00:41:57,654 --> 00:42:02,664
Oh, great. Another one
with the brother shit.

897
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:08,856
So, you're a friend
of his, huh?

898
00:42:08,864 --> 00:42:11,504
Look, man, that's
my motherfucking man.

899
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:12,699
Go back like
car seats, baby.

900
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,900
There's too much crime
and too much time.

901
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:17,873
See what I'm saying?

902
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:20,468
Oh, Christ almighty.

903
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:21,613
You all right, man?

904
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:22,937
Yeah, I'm fine.

905
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,021
I got to take a piss.

906
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:25,114
Go ahead, man,
take a break.

907
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,809
I ain't gonna
give you no--

908
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,510
you, just be quiet
till Mike gets back.

909
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,872
Oh, so he's here?

910
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:31,218
Yeah, he's up
at the roof.

911
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:32,584
He said you was to wait
for him till he comes down.

912
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:34,182
Said to keep you here.

913
00:42:45,994 --> 00:42:47,094
Yo, my man.

914
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:48,185
What?

915
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,596
Can I put my hands
down now?

916
00:42:50,598 --> 00:42:52,968
Yeah.

917
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:55,204
Don't think I
won't cap you one

918
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:56,671
just because you're
a friend of Mike's.

919
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,270
No problem, man.

920
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,502
Yo, what's
your name?

921
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:01,736
What? Are we
fucking friends?

922
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,010
What's your name, man?

923
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:05,118
Torch.

924
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,235
I'm Tony t.
Nice to meet you.

925
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:07,843
Whatever.

926
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,010
I seen you somewhere
before, right?

927
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:14,075
Never.

928
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:15,152
You sure I ain't
never met you before?

929
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,330
Hey, let me
tell you something.

930
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,515
I never seen you before.
You never seen me before.

931
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:21,101
I don't know you.
I don't want to know you.

932
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:22,685
I'd just as soon shoot you
as look at you. You got it?

933
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,620
I got it, man.
No problem, all right?

934
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,885
Put your fucking hands
behind your head.

935
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:28,733
Mikey?

936
00:43:28,728 --> 00:43:30,088
Mikey, man.

937
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:31,226
I got to take
a leak, man.

938
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,500
You better get
down here fast,

939
00:43:32,497 --> 00:43:33,757
or I'm going to fucking
put one in your friend here.

940
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:35,925
Hey, yo, take it
easy, all right?

941
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:38,173
You, shut the fuck up.

942
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,739
Oh, shit.

943
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,040
Ohh!

944
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:53,539
Ohh...Ohh, shit!

945
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:54,276
Shit, no.

946
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,610
Mike: Oh, yeah, Billy.

947
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:56,614
Motherfucker!

948
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:58,715
Oh, shit!
Fuck, man, whoa!

949
00:43:58,717 --> 00:44:00,847
Take it easy, torch.

950
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:04,052
Give me the gun.
Don't shoot, ok?

951
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:05,215
What's the matter?
You ok, bro?

952
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,692
Don't fucking call
me that.

953
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,790
What's the matter?
Tony, what happened?

954
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:09,892
I think your boy had
a little accident.

955
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:12,263
I pissed
my fucking pants, man.

956
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:17,702
Oh...Shit, uh...
I'm sorry, bro.

957
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,730
Hold up. Hold up.
Come here. Come on.

958
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:23,666
Now, you sit
over here, all right?

959
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:24,742
There you go.

960
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:25,699
20/20 Mike.

961
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:28,706
Tony t., what's up,
huh? Ha ha!

962
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:29,839
So, what
happened, Mike?

963
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:31,613
Fellas, can I get
a hand over here?

964
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:33,681
Hey, yo, chill.

965
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,749
We'll get you cleaned up
in a second, ok?

966
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,253
Tony: What up, Mike?

967
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:40,601
Well, it's a long story.

968
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:41,951
Hey, you ain't seen nobody
following you, did you?

969
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:43,623
No. Two dudes
on the corner

970
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:45,621
using the pay phone.

971
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:47,153
Word?

972
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:48,666
Word.<i> Suave,</i> Mike.

973
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:50,189
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i> Suave.</i> We cool.

974
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:53,764
You bet. Torch, ok?

975
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:55,004
Fuck you.

976
00:44:54,998 --> 00:44:56,228
Torch: Fuck the both
of you cocksuckers.

977
00:44:56,232 --> 00:44:57,472
I'm bleeding.
My fucking hand's killing me.

978
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:58,696
I'm soaked to the gills
in my own piss,

979
00:44:58,702 --> 00:45:00,172
for Christ's sakes.

980
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,270
Torch, just take it
easy, ok?

981
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:02,941
It's all right.
I got some old sweats

982
00:45:02,939 --> 00:45:04,199
in my ride downstairs.

983
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:05,906
I'll go get them,
bring them up,

984
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,357
get you out
of them pissy pants,

985
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:08,807
get you cleaned up,
all right?

986
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:10,639
Well, hurry up. What the fuck
are waiting on?

987
00:45:10,644 --> 00:45:12,164
I'm dying over here.

988
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:13,681
Damn, Mike. Where you find
this evil motherfucker?

989
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,650
It's a long story.

990
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:16,047
Can you get us
something to eat,

991
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,678
and maybe something
to drink, too?

992
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:19,042
No problem.

993
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:20,388
Yeah, some cigarettes
and something sweet.

994
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:21,754
And maybe some stuff
to clean up his hand?

995
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,792
You know, it's
pretty fucked up.

996
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,298
Yeah. No problem, man.

997
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,815
What happened, man?
What did y'all do?

998
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,994
We tried to
beat somebody

999
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,333
and we ran
into a little problem.

1000
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:32,357
Tried to beat
somebody? Who?

1001
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:33,831
Yeah, well, you
don't want to know.

1002
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:34,889
Manny Rivera, that's who.

1003
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:36,326
Torch: Ok? You can
fucking go now.

1004
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,760
Wait a minute. Wait
the fuck a minute here.

1005
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:40,095
You beat Manny Rivera?

1006
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,503
For how many keys?

1007
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:44,151
3. Supposed to be 4.

1008
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:45,802
Torch: We lost one.
What a fucking waste.

1009
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:47,154
You got a lot of nerve

1010
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:48,489
talking that shit
after what you did.

1011
00:45:48,494 --> 00:45:49,844
You going to start that
fucking shit with me again?

1012
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:50,991
You're so
fucking stupid.

1013
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:52,141
The next time you
call me fucking stupid--

1014
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:53,963
there won't be
no next time,

1015
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,780
Manny Rivera find
you two motherfuckers.

1016
00:46:02,786 --> 00:46:04,916
[Sighs]

1017
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:31,477
I'm not feeling
too good, Mike.

1018
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,109
You got to stop moving
around so much.

1019
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,950
Look, Tony will be back
in a minute, all right?

1020
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,253
Let me see your hand.

1021
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:44,554
I can't feel
my fingers.

1022
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:47,815
I think I'm going to
pass out.

1023
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,791
Jesus, man, you all
fucking sweaty and shit.

1024
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:52,022
That's this fucking cold
I'm trying to catch.

1025
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,286
I'll be fine as soon as
we get out of here.

1026
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:55,093
All right, all right.
Let me see that hand.

1027
00:46:55,094 --> 00:46:56,964
No, just leave it alone.
It will be fine.

1028
00:46:56,962 --> 00:46:58,362
Come on. You keep it
in your pocket,

1029
00:46:58,363 --> 00:47:00,833
it's only going to get
infected. Let me see.

1030
00:47:00,832 --> 00:47:01,562
No. Ow!

1031
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:02,526
Let me see.

1032
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,123
No, man, stop.

1033
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:05,713
Let go of my fucking arm,
for Christ's sakes, will you?

1034
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:07,303
Yeah, ok, go ahead.
Keep in your pocket.

1035
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:08,484
Bleed to death, stupid.

1036
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:09,662
Hey, next fucking time
you call me stupid,

1037
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,840
I'll throw you a beating
you'll never forget.

1038
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Oh, right. With one
fucking hand, right?

1039
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:16,543
You know, that shit gets
infected bad enough,

1040
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:18,435
you get gangrene.

1041
00:47:18,446 --> 00:47:19,956
Cut the fucking thing
off of you.

1042
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,483
The fuck they will.
Besides, it ain't that bad.

1043
00:47:21,482 --> 00:47:22,912
Oh, that's
what you think?

1044
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:24,026
Well, then, hey.

1045
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,153
See if I give
a marvelous fuck

1046
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:26,051
when it falls off.

1047
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,221
It ain't gonna fall off.

1048
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:31,289
It ain't that bad.
I'm telling you.

1049
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:39,963
Just a scratch.

1050
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:43,096
Ok.

1051
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:46,525
Yo, house,
where's Manny?

1052
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,873
I got to talk
to him.

1053
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:51,338
Manny went to see
his mother.

1054
00:47:51,337 --> 00:47:53,397
You take care
of your boy?

1055
00:47:53,405 --> 00:47:55,465
I'm working on him.

1056
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,410
Buddha: Hmm.

1057
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,510
Ruffy, you owe me $100.

1058
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:09,382
Nah, nah. Give him
a chance. He's a virgin.

1059
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:11,585
[Chuckles]

1060
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:16,058
What you going
to do now?

1061
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:19,558
Buddha: I don't know
what happened,

1062
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,400
but something's
got to be a deal.

1063
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:24,857
We'll give you another
couple of hours

1064
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:26,325
to take care
of your business.

1065
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:31,073
Or your business
becomes our business.

1066
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:33,241
Ahh-ahh!

1067
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:36,439
Make me some money, baby.

1068
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:44,607
Look, I didn't want
to say nothing,

1069
00:48:44,615 --> 00:48:46,645
but I think
I seen him before.

1070
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,980
Who?

1071
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:50,924
Your friend there.
Frosted flakes.

1072
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,590
Tony?

1073
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:53,287
Yeah.
You sure?

1074
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:54,318
Yeah, I'm sure.

1075
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:56,622
You positive?

1076
00:48:56,624 --> 00:48:58,564
I don't know.
I can't remember where.

1077
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,659
How could you forget
somebody like Tony?

1078
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:02,431
I don't know,
but it will come to me.

1079
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:03,899
I'll tell you
one fucking thing for sure,

1080
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:04,927
I don't like him.

1081
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:05,960
Yeah, well, you
didn't like me

1082
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:08,395
when you met me either,
Mr. Williams.

1083
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,500
Cut me a break with that
Mr. Williams shit.

1084
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:13,374
Sorry, bro.

1085
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:15,041
Stop calling me bro.

1086
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:16,329
Jesus. I've known you
two weeks.

1087
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,618
Already the biggest
pain in the ass

1088
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:18,907
I've ever had in my
whole fucking life.

1089
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,209
Well, that's only natural

1090
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:21,509
seeing as how me and you
got the same fucking father.

1091
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:23,011
You and me is
different, period.

1092
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:24,242
What you and me
got in common,

1093
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:25,346
I don't want to
talk about.

1094
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:26,647
What I want
to know about

1095
00:49:26,648 --> 00:49:28,408
is your friend there--

1096
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:30,175
fucking Tony
the frosted flake.

1097
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:32,547
Mike: Come on, man.
Fucking Tony the tiger.

1098
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,952
Torch: What's
the difference?

1099
00:49:33,952 --> 00:49:35,352
We're talking about
the same guy, right?

1100
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:36,424
So, what about him?

1101
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:37,591
How you know
we can trust him?

1102
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:38,868
You see what I'm saying?

1103
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:40,162
How do you know
he won't rat us out?

1104
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:42,537
No way!

1105
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:44,932
Look, man. Me and Tony did
too much time together for that.

1106
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:45,628
You sure?

1107
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:46,928
Yeah, I'm sure.

1108
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:49,549
Positive?

1109
00:49:49,547 --> 00:49:52,157
Absolutely.
Absolutely positive.

1110
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:55,268
Ok.

1111
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,940
Ok.

1112
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:01,967
Hey, Mike.

1113
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:03,144
What?

1114
00:50:03,141 --> 00:50:06,681
You think they'll
really cut my hand off?

1115
00:50:12,014 --> 00:50:15,254
Tony, voice-over:
I was young, impressive,

1116
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,120
hot with my fancy.

1117
00:50:17,118 --> 00:50:21,418
I was known as
the adequate male.

1118
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:25,292
Oh, but how I cursed the day
I made my play

1119
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,292
for that sidewalk jezebel.

1120
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,534
Manny: Precious.
Hey, come here.

1121
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:32,259
She was a brown-skinned moll
like a China doll

1122
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:34,225
walking the path of sin.

1123
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:37,403
Up and down she trod
with a wink and a nod,

1124
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,542
and this bitch
I had to win.

1125
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,997
What's up, Manny?

1126
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,366
No, it was not by chance
I caught her glance

1127
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,305
because I meant
to steal this thing,

1128
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:50,081
and when she looked at me,
I jumped a league.

1129
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,250
Said it's time
for old slim again.

1130
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:56,553
Freddie, did you
miss us?

1131
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:58,531
[Freddie groaning]

1132
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:00,515
Boo hoo hoo. Trying
to say something?

1133
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:02,291
What?

1134
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:04,459
Huh?

1135
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:06,217
What's the matter?

1136
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:09,985
You got problems
with language?

1137
00:51:09,995 --> 00:51:12,395
Come on, fellas.
Give me a break, man.

1138
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:14,657
Why you got to treat
a brother like this?

1139
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:16,045
A brother?

1140
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:17,429
What are you,
a comedian now?

1141
00:51:17,434 --> 00:51:18,604
You a funny man?

1142
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:20,271
No, man, I'm just
trying to add

1143
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:21,369
a little levity

1144
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,469
to the situation,
you know.

1145
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:23,571
Levity?

1146
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:24,742
Oh, that's
a good idea.

1147
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:26,439
Here's levity.

1148
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,040
Seriously, fellas,
life's too short.

1149
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,311
You shouldn't take
everything so serious.

1150
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:33,339
Oh, philosophy now, huh?

1151
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:35,783
Make me laugh.

1152
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,060
He's right.

1153
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:38,354
Make--make
Buddha laugh.

1154
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:39,309
You make him laugh,

1155
00:51:39,316 --> 00:51:41,776
you get to live
a little longer.

1156
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:44,145
Yeah. Ok.
Yeah. All right.

1157
00:51:44,154 --> 00:51:45,194
Show your best.

1158
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,148
Ok. All right,
here's a good one.

1159
00:51:47,156 --> 00:51:48,616
There's a--there's
a white guy,

1160
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:51,364
a Chinese guy,
and a black guy,

1161
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,730
all in the fifth grade.

1162
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:55,598
Who's got
the biggest dick?

1163
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:56,657
I don't know.

1164
00:51:56,664 --> 00:51:57,734
Who's got
the biggest dick?

1165
00:51:57,732 --> 00:52:00,072
The black guy,
of course.

1166
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:01,567
He's 18.

1167
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:03,528
Ha ha ha!

1168
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:04,566
18...

1169
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,340
You motherfuck--

1170
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:07,468
ow!

1171
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:09,102
Looks like you lost
a lot of blood, Billy.

1172
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,166
Yeah. You should have
seen the other guy.

1173
00:52:11,174 --> 00:52:12,574
Yeah. Very funny,
very funny.

1174
00:52:12,575 --> 00:52:13,825
Now don't move.

1175
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,091
All right, but it's
fucking--

1176
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:16,337
I told you
it fucking hurts--ow!

1177
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:17,635
Hey. Quit moving, then.

1178
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:20,546
You know, we're lucky
to be alive.

1179
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:22,478
Come on. Quit
fucking moving, Billy.

1180
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:23,653
You keep fucking
poking, and I told you

1181
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,280
it hurts me,
for Christ's sakes.

1182
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:26,554
You know, I swear to God
if I get any more

1183
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:27,831
of your blood on me,
I'm gonna--

1184
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:29,115
you think you're gonna
fucking catch something?

1185
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,550
Don't worry, I've been
tested more times

1186
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:31,524
than I can count.

1187
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:34,041
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too.

1188
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:36,559
Great. Makes us one
happy fucking family.

1189
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,429
Ha ha ha!

1190
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:39,627
You fucking asshole.

1191
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:40,828
What are you
talking about?

1192
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:43,229
Look at you, man.

1193
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:45,361
What?

1194
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:47,495
You're all fucking
pissy and shit.

1195
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,951
I'm sorry.

1196
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:50,401
Look, we got to get you
out of the jacket.

1197
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:51,303
Ok.

1198
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:52,303
All right?

1199
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,303
Yeah. Take it easy
because

1200
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:54,535
it fucking hurts,
all right?

1201
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,569
Don't fuck around.

1202
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,535
Ok.

1203
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:00,683
On 3--

1204
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,738
let me help you.

1205
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:02,905
All right. Ready?

1206
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:05,382
1, 2, 3, go.

1207
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:06,651
Aah! Fucking shit.

1208
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:07,678
Attaboy. Attaboy.

1209
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:10,422
Motherfucking
son of a bitch.

1210
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:12,378
There you go, Billy.

1211
00:53:12,386 --> 00:53:13,846
You did it, huh?

1212
00:53:13,854 --> 00:53:15,254
You did it, all right?

1213
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:16,215
Fuck, yeah.

1214
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:17,352
Good. Good.

1215
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:20,656
Ok. Ok? All right.

1216
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:21,859
Hey, Mike, wait.

1217
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,790
What? What?

1218
00:53:22,793 --> 00:53:23,733
You ain't gonna
tell anybody

1219
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:25,488
I pissed my pants,
are you?

1220
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:26,726
No, I'm not gonna
tell anybody

1221
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:27,730
you pissed your pants.

1222
00:53:27,731 --> 00:53:28,701
You swear?

1223
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:31,228
I swear to my mother.
Ok?

1224
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:32,773
Ok.

1225
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,527
Come on,
come on.

1226
00:53:34,535 --> 00:53:36,635
Ok.

1227
00:53:36,637 --> 00:53:38,647
All right.

1228
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:40,665
A guy's going to buy
a brain, right?

1229
00:53:40,674 --> 00:53:42,544
There's
a white guy's brain,

1230
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:43,672
a Chinese guy's brain,

1231
00:53:43,676 --> 00:53:46,706
and a black guy's brain.

1232
00:53:46,712 --> 00:53:48,582
White guy's brain
is $200,

1233
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,310
Chinese guy's brain
is $300,

1234
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:54,376
the black guy's brain
is $5,000.

1235
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:56,545
This guy goes,
"hey, how come

1236
00:53:56,553 --> 00:53:59,393
the black guy's brain
is so expensive?"

1237
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:03,889
The guy goes, "it's
never been used."

1238
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:04,763
Ha ha ha!

1239
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,890
Never been used,
you dumb--

1240
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:19,297
go ahead. Lay down.

1241
00:54:19,306 --> 00:54:22,436
I like two pillows.

1242
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:29,814
Mmm.

1243
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,742
So what's up with
you and him, huh?

1244
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:55,767
What's all this
too much crime,

1245
00:54:55,772 --> 00:54:57,672
too much time shit
all about?

1246
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:58,673
Like I say, man,

1247
00:54:58,674 --> 00:54:59,874
too much time,
too much crime.

1248
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:01,095
I mean, it's funny

1249
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,318
we even ended up
being friends.

1250
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:03,541
We were supposed to have
this big fucking fight

1251
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:05,595
when we met.

1252
00:55:05,596 --> 00:55:07,646
The two of youse was
supposed to fight?

1253
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:08,619
I'd pay good money

1254
00:55:08,616 --> 00:55:09,576
to see you get
your ass kicked.

1255
00:55:09,584 --> 00:55:11,584
Ain't that much
kung foolishness

1256
00:55:11,586 --> 00:55:13,046
in the world, all right?

1257
00:55:13,054 --> 00:55:14,394
I'd have paid.

1258
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:15,718
Yeah. You and the guy
that started it.

1259
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:17,493
Fucking garnett--

1260
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:19,721
little guy
with a big mouth, right?

1261
00:55:19,726 --> 00:55:20,726
Said he was
Tony's cousin,

1262
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:22,317
but he wasn't, right?

1263
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:23,907
See, what happened was,
we was in the eighth grade.

1264
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,497
It was just before school
was getting out for summer.

1265
00:55:25,498 --> 00:55:26,728
I remember it was hot
that day.

1266
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:27,972
Me and some of my boys
were in the bathroom

1267
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:29,697
smoking cigarettes
after lunch period.

1268
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:33,372
So, fucking garnett
comes in with his boys.

1269
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,672
You know.
He's wearing, like,

1270
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:36,353
a brand-new leather jacket,

1271
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:38,032
talking shit about how
he robbed it off somebody,

1272
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:39,711
about how he did this,
that, the other thing

1273
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,921
to the guy.

1274
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,130
Anyway, I said
to garnett, I said,

1275
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:43,339
"what's the big
fucking deal, man?

1276
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:44,548
It's only
a fucking jacket, right?"

1277
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,779
The next thing I know,

1278
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:48,254
the punk jumps up
in my face.

1279
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:49,721
You know, talking about
he was gonna kick my ass

1280
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,990
if I didn't mind
my business.

1281
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:52,847
So, I picked him up,
I threw him headfirst

1282
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:56,055
right into the fucking
toilet bowl.

1283
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,832
Motherfucker did not know
whether to shit

1284
00:55:58,827 --> 00:56:00,927
or go blind, but that
ain't stopping him

1285
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:02,799
from running his mouth.
No. Mm-mmm.

1286
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:04,157
He's all like, uh,

1287
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:05,534
"my cousin Tony's gonna
make you sorry

1288
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:06,773
you ever messed with me,"
right?

1289
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:10,027
The next thing I know,
everybody around my way,

1290
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:11,996
they're telling me
about some big dude

1291
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:13,704
who's looking for me,

1292
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,405
he's into that fucking
kung fu, karate-type shit.

1293
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:16,967
So now, I'm bugging
the fuck out, right?

1294
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:18,465
I mean,
I got my switchblade,

1295
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,606
I'm all up and down
the Avenue

1296
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,640
looking for this guy.

1297
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,555
I'm standing
across the street

1298
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:25,483
from Danny's candy
store--ping ping.

1299
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,452
Ping ping.

1300
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,420
So I turn around,
and I could see it was him.

1301
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:32,619
He says to me,
"you're Mike?"

1302
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,822
I'm like, "yeah,
you're Tony?"

1303
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,204
He's like, "yeah,"

1304
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,582
so now I got my hand
on the switchblade,

1305
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,960
and I'm hoping I get it
out of my pocket, you know,

1306
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:42,101
before he commences
to kung foo-ing my ass.

1307
00:56:42,097 --> 00:56:43,857
Next thing I know,
he says to me,

1308
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:45,634
"you want to go
for a walk?" "Yeah."

1309
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:46,973
I'm telling you,
bro, it was,

1310
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,527
it was like we were
strangers to each other,

1311
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:50,966
but we wasn't.

1312
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,910
And we've been like this
ever since, man.

1313
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:57,737
Went to erasmus hall
together,

1314
00:56:57,743 --> 00:56:59,883
drank, smoke, got high...

1315
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:02,448
Ate at each other's house
all the time.

1316
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:06,617
You saw him, you saw me
and vice versa, yo.

1317
00:57:07,818 --> 00:57:09,118
My mom's practically
adopted him,

1318
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,619
and my sister, Debbie,
forget about it, man.

1319
00:57:12,622 --> 00:57:16,692
She loved her some Tony.

1320
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:18,142
Senior year, we--

1321
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:19,592
we got tired
of doing school, you know--

1322
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:20,964
dropped out, started
doing crime instead.

1323
00:57:20,962 --> 00:57:26,732
Got busted. They done
put us on riker's island.

1324
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:30,803
I spent a whole 18 months
locked up with this dude.

1325
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:32,073
I don't even know how
I would have

1326
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:35,000
done my time without him,
you know?

1327
00:57:35,006 --> 00:57:39,836
He used to recite this--
this poem all the time.

1328
00:57:39,844 --> 00:57:43,784
This crazy, jailhouse
poetry-type shit,

1329
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:46,351
know what I'm saying?

1330
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:48,919
Tony: And under them neon
lights, her eyes shone bright,

1331
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:51,649
and from them,
a teardrop fell.

1332
00:57:51,655 --> 00:57:53,955
When I asked her why,
she began to cry

1333
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:55,687
and tell me
this bitter tale,

1334
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:57,762
all about some guy
that blacks her eye

1335
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,060
and takes all the bread
she gets.

1336
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:03,563
When she lands in jail,
he won't go for bail,

1337
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:07,625
and he defies her
to call it quits.

1338
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:11,665
Well, I said, darling,
dry them tears.

1339
00:58:11,672 --> 00:58:13,662
Have no fear,

1340
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,636
because the tender,
kind lover is here,

1341
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:19,442
and I'm staking a claim
on all parts of your game.

1342
00:58:19,445 --> 00:58:21,135
I'm vowing to have
no peer.

1343
00:58:21,146 --> 00:58:24,076
Well, she looked at me
like a slave set free

1344
00:58:24,082 --> 00:58:26,452
and said, "I'll be
your woman."

1345
00:58:26,451 --> 00:58:30,151
And when I left with her,
her man did not stir.

1346
00:58:30,154 --> 00:58:33,724
Yeah. I knew I had me one.

1347
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:40,631
That shit really
got me through, bro.

1348
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,600
Helped me hang
in there, you know,

1349
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:43,798
and do my time.

1350
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,629
Mike: And then
when we got out,

1351
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:47,674
and he had Maxine pregnant
with precious,

1352
00:58:47,669 --> 00:58:49,739
he asked me
to be the godfather.

1353
00:58:49,737 --> 00:58:53,637
Me--nobody but me.

1354
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:59,575
Nah, man.
Fuck that noise, man.

1355
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,214
Ain't no way that
he would rat us out.

1356
00:59:02,213 --> 00:59:05,453
That's my
motherfucking man.

1357
00:59:05,448 --> 00:59:08,678
Mike: Too much time,
too much crime.

1358
00:59:08,685 --> 00:59:10,885
You know what I'm saying?

1359
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:14,047
Mike: Torch, you ok?

1360
00:59:14,056 --> 00:59:17,016
Billy.

1361
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:21,685
Come on.
Wake up, bro.

1362
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:25,158
Yo, Mike.

1363
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,000
I got something sweet, man.

1364
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:38,643
¶ And the itsy bitsy
spider ¶

1365
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:44,211
¶ climbed up
the spout again ¶

1366
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,813
somebody's not
singing here.

1367
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:51,923
Who's not
singing here?

1368
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:54,749
Who's not
singing here?

1369
00:59:54,755 --> 00:59:57,255
Mommy.

1370
00:59:57,257 --> 00:59:59,757
What's the matter,
mommy? Sing with us.

1371
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,190
Yeah, mommy.

1372
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:06,725
What time does
a Chinese guy

1373
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:08,062
go to the dentist?

1374
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,666
Look out now.

1375
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:10,797
2:30.

1376
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:12,751
Ok.

1377
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:14,702
"Tooth hurty,"
you fucking--aah!

1378
01:00:17,173 --> 01:00:22,043
Oh, no. It's tooth hurty.

1379
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:23,944
Aah.

1380
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:27,877
Come on, come on.

1381
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:29,731
Why do white people

1382
01:00:29,732 --> 01:00:31,582
go to black people's
garage sales?

1383
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:32,954
I don't know.
Why?

1384
01:00:32,952 --> 01:00:35,052
To get
their stuff back.

1385
01:00:35,054 --> 01:00:37,594
Ha ha ha!

1386
01:00:41,793 --> 01:00:42,993
Why did the black guy

1387
01:00:42,994 --> 01:00:46,004
hit the white guy?

1388
01:00:45,997 --> 01:00:49,227
Because he
wasn't funny.

1389
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:52,867
Pace yourself now,
ruffy, come on.

1390
01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:56,199
Don't give yourself
a heart attack.

1391
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:59,635
Be in control
of your emotions.

1392
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:01,941
Knock, knock.

1393
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:06,680
Knock, knock.

1394
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:10,983
Knock, knock.

1395
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:15,181
No one's home.

1396
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:18,468
Just one more time,

1397
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:19,618
break it down
for me, man.

1398
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,950
Make me understand.

1399
01:01:21,955 --> 01:01:24,785
Ok?

1400
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,261
Ok.

1401
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:27,718
Like I say,
we got to

1402
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:30,627
the stuyvesant
hotel around 3:00,

1403
01:01:30,629 --> 01:01:32,229
cased the joint,
like me and you

1404
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,560
used to do
back in the day

1405
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,904
when we flim-flammed all
them wall street types.

1406
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,229
Tony: I hear you.

1407
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:39,874
Now, we were
supposed to meet,

1408
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:41,129
like around 4:00.

1409
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:43,066
Around about 3:30,
these 3<i> chulitos</i>

1410
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:44,601
show up I never
seen before, man--

1411
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:46,115
real young cats.

1412
01:01:46,122 --> 01:01:47,642
Really young--couldn't
have been no more

1413
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:49,911
than what, 19, 20
years old at the most?

1414
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:52,279
Yeah. Had on them
baggy clothes,

1415
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:53,558
fucking cornbred hair--

1416
01:01:53,562 --> 01:01:54,852
they were straight up
stickup kids.

1417
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:55,777
Mike: They was
babies, man.

1418
01:01:55,781 --> 01:01:57,251
Tony, I mean,
they were riding

1419
01:01:57,249 --> 01:01:58,949
in an elevator
with 4 kilos of heroin

1420
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,480
and looked like
they was still

1421
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:02,024
on their mama's titty,
<i> ni me pregunte.</i>

1422
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,389
So, we get to
the eighth floor.

1423
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:05,568
I break left.
They break right.

1424
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:06,762
I can feel them
clocking me, right,

1425
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:07,757
but I never look back.

1426
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:08,788
No, no, no.
I just keep walking

1427
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,092
like I'm going
towards my room,

1428
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,833
and what happened?

1429
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:14,358
Ping ping.

1430
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,033
My 20/20 goes off,
right?

1431
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:17,731
Tells me exactly
what room

1432
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:19,102
they go to, right?

1433
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,200
Fucking guy got eyes

1434
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:21,301
in the back
of his head, man.

1435
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,302
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ping ping.

1436
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:24,804
So check it:

1437
01:02:24,805 --> 01:02:26,305
I just ease
down the hall.

1438
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:27,806
I couldn't believe
that Manny would send

1439
01:02:27,808 --> 01:02:28,768
such young, dumb
motherfuckers

1440
01:02:28,775 --> 01:02:30,205
to deal
with all this weight,

1441
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:31,189
but I figure, ok,

1442
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:32,172
it makes the job
easier, right?

1443
01:02:32,177 --> 01:02:34,507
I knock on the door.
They let me in.

1444
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:35,632
They frisk me.

1445
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:36,749
They ask me
who I got with me,

1446
01:02:36,747 --> 01:02:38,257
that type of shit.

1447
01:02:38,264 --> 01:02:39,784
I see they're getting
a little nervous.

1448
01:02:39,783 --> 01:02:40,633
So what do I do?

1449
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:41,483
Try to chill them out
a little bit.

1450
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:42,874
You know, try to make

1451
01:02:42,868 --> 01:02:44,248
a little
light conversation.

1452
01:02:44,253 --> 01:02:45,503
Chill them out,

1453
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:46,738
tell them how
professional they are.

1454
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:47,993
You know, how Manny's
a stand-up guy,

1455
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,160
he's always bringing
up new talent,

1456
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:50,817
it's always a pleasure
doing business

1457
01:02:50,825 --> 01:02:52,325
with him and his people,

1458
01:02:52,326 --> 01:02:53,826
blahsy, blahsy, blahsy,
blip, blip, blip,

1459
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:54,758
bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit.

1460
01:02:54,762 --> 01:02:56,432
Carlito?
Chill,<i> papi.</i>

1461
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,860
Mike: They seemed
to chill out after that.

1462
01:02:58,865 --> 01:03:02,365
So, torch knocks
on the door.

1463
01:03:03,835 --> 01:03:06,195
The kid lets him in
because he thinks

1464
01:03:06,204 --> 01:03:08,474
that we've got
Manny's money.

1465
01:03:08,472 --> 01:03:09,872
Money talks.
Bullshit walks.

1466
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,913
Here endeth
the lesson.

1467
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:12,507
That's why the shit
went wrong, bro.

1468
01:03:12,508 --> 01:03:14,168
You came in sweaty

1469
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:15,876
with your jaws
all tight.

1470
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:16,877
You wasn't cool.

1471
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:17,877
Fucking guy was reaching
for his piece.

1472
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,009
He never would have
fired on us

1473
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:20,283
if you'd have
just chilled.

1474
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,550
Get the fuck out of here.
You don't know that.

1475
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,078
Yeah, I do.
Let me tell you why.

1476
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:25,782
Because I done it.
Me and Tony, man.

1477
01:03:25,784 --> 01:03:27,824
We were in the same game
with a lot of people, man.

1478
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:31,389
And you got busted,
though, Mr. pro.

1479
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,045
Anyway...

1480
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:34,805
Yeah, anyway...

1481
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,556
So you started
shooting.

1482
01:03:36,558 --> 01:03:37,718
Then what?

1483
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:38,885
You should have
seen it, man.

1484
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:39,933
Fucking bullets
are flying--

1485
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:41,057
[imitates gunplay]

1486
01:03:41,061 --> 01:03:42,431
Fucking blood
was everywhere.

1487
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:44,259
Man, I must have
fucking shot these kids

1488
01:03:44,264 --> 01:03:46,134
5, 6 fucking times.

1489
01:03:46,132 --> 01:03:47,872
Lit their asses up, man.

1490
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:49,867
Fucking the whole joint
smelled like gunpowder.

1491
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:51,899
I didn't even know
I was shot at first.

1492
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:53,874
It felt more like
something burned me.

1493
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,952
Yeah, yeah.

1494
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,030
And then we lost
one of the 4 kilos

1495
01:03:56,028 --> 01:03:57,108
because you
started shooting.

1496
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:58,338
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1497
01:03:58,342 --> 01:03:59,582
I tried to pick up
what was left.

1498
01:03:59,577 --> 01:04:00,507
The shit was everywhere.

1499
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,861
It was mixed up

1500
01:04:01,856 --> 01:04:03,196
with the shooter's blood
and whatnot.

1501
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:04,551
Tasted like some very
high-quality shit, though.

1502
01:04:04,548 --> 01:04:06,508
Yeah. Thank you
very fucking much.

1503
01:04:06,516 --> 01:04:08,516
So you picked up
the rest of the shit.

1504
01:04:08,518 --> 01:04:10,048
You got the fuck
out of dodge.

1505
01:04:10,052 --> 01:04:12,052
Tony: So afterwards,
where did you go?

1506
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:13,194
Went to Brooklyn.

1507
01:04:13,188 --> 01:04:14,088
Brooklyn?

1508
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:14,988
Yeah. Let me
tell you something.

1509
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:16,289
We could've got busted

1510
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:17,589
waiting for that
fucking asshole.

1511
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:18,591
Who?

1512
01:04:18,591 --> 01:04:19,591
Freddie:
So what's up, fellas?

1513
01:04:19,593 --> 01:04:20,863
Are we going to
do this or what?

1514
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,860
He's all fucking
worried over here.

1515
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:24,532
Are we going
to move the shit?

1516
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,600
Don't worry
about it.

1517
01:04:25,597 --> 01:04:27,597
Yeah, yeah. I got
this guy in sales

1518
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:29,598
says he can
move the shit no problem.

1519
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:32,601
So where
and when?

1520
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:34,504
The stuyvesant hotel--

1521
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:36,065
get this--

1522
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:37,273
on Halloween.

1523
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:39,274
Tony: What the fuck
made you think

1524
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:41,336
you could trust that
motherfucker, Mike?

1525
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:42,634
Come on, man.

1526
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,908
We used to get all
our flimflam victims

1527
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,713
from him, right?

1528
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:47,514
Yeah, but didn't you
never stop to think, Mike?

1529
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,476
It might have been him
that set us up

1530
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:51,254
to get busted, man.

1531
01:04:51,252 --> 01:04:52,352
Yeah, yeah, but...

1532
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:54,603
But nothing.

1533
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:56,854
The fucking guy has been
working for Manny for years.

1534
01:04:56,857 --> 01:04:57,857
Word?

1535
01:04:57,858 --> 01:04:59,388
Word.

1536
01:04:59,392 --> 01:05:00,932
Right over here
in the fucking park.

1537
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:02,456
Yo. Remember when nine lives
got shot in the head?

1538
01:05:02,462 --> 01:05:04,562
Yeah, when Manny--
I remember that.

1539
01:05:04,564 --> 01:05:06,204
That's how
he got his name.

1540
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:06,958
Mm-hmm.

1541
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:07,955
Well, ever since then,

1542
01:05:07,966 --> 01:05:09,396
Manny has been real
superstitious

1543
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,460
about nine lives.

1544
01:05:10,459 --> 01:05:11,519
I mean, he keeps
that motherfucker around

1545
01:05:11,518 --> 01:05:12,578
like a fucking
rabbit's foot.

1546
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:13,637
They ain't even invented
the type of shit

1547
01:05:13,637 --> 01:05:15,137
that can kill nine lives.

1548
01:05:15,138 --> 01:05:16,798
Where did you
hear all this?

1549
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:18,465
What do you mean,
where did I hear all this?

1550
01:05:18,474 --> 01:05:19,794
I heard it around.

1551
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:21,096
What do you mean,
you heard it around?

1552
01:05:21,098 --> 01:05:22,408
Around, man.
You know, around.

1553
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:23,441
No, I don't know.

1554
01:05:23,444 --> 01:05:24,484
Around the corner?
Around the block?

1555
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,549
Around the fucking
world? What?

1556
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,547
Mike: Come on, torch,
lighten up, all right?

1557
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,579
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

1558
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:31,864
No problem, Mike.

1559
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:33,142
I just want to know where
you heard about nine lives.

1560
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,420
You said he's
out of the life, remember?

1561
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,651
So how the fuck
does he know?

1562
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,560
Yeah. Where did you
hear all this, Tony?

1563
01:05:44,563 --> 01:05:46,613
Tony: Mike,

1564
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:48,664
I come to the city sometimes
with my old lady, all right?

1565
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,627
Now, you know Maxine.

1566
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:52,595
She likes the restaurants,
the shops over here,

1567
01:05:52,604 --> 01:05:54,804
and whatnot.

1568
01:05:54,805 --> 01:05:57,005
I run into people
from back in the day.

1569
01:05:57,008 --> 01:05:59,008
I hear things.

1570
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:01,440
Hears things.

1571
01:06:01,445 --> 01:06:03,205
Fucking hears things.

1572
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:04,513
Hear that, Mr. Williams?

1573
01:06:04,514 --> 01:06:05,454
Mike: What?

1574
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:06,578
Fucking rat is--

1575
01:06:06,582 --> 01:06:07,582
where?

1576
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,553
Right here, bro.
Your friend--

1577
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:12,921
Tony the frosted flake.

1578
01:06:14,088 --> 01:06:15,118
What's the matter, Mike?

1579
01:06:15,122 --> 01:06:16,652
Your fucking ping-ping
ain't working?

1580
01:06:16,656 --> 01:06:18,086
I told you I seen
this guy before.

1581
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:21,360
All I got
is the white girl, baby.

1582
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,619
If you're looking
to score dope,

1583
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:25,386
you have to take your
business elsewhere.

1584
01:06:25,395 --> 01:06:26,655
See what I'm saying?

1585
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:27,562
Mike: You sure?

1586
01:06:27,562 --> 01:06:28,992
Torch: Yeah, I'm sure.

1587
01:06:28,996 --> 01:06:30,276
You positive?

1588
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,560
Absolutely, absolutely
positive.

1589
01:06:31,565 --> 01:06:33,925
Torch: Freddie,
I got to get well.

1590
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:35,104
Ok.

1591
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:37,431
Freddie, what the fuck
you doing?

1592
01:06:37,436 --> 01:06:38,886
What?

1593
01:06:38,886 --> 01:06:40,336
Manny find out
you selling dope,

1594
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:43,338
he going to
crucify your ass.

1595
01:06:43,341 --> 01:06:44,641
Fuck Manny,
all right?

1596
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:47,042
But you wasn't shopping
with your old lady,

1597
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,544
was you, my man?

1598
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:51,345
You know who
I was with, punk.

1599
01:06:51,547 --> 01:06:52,547
Ohh, fuck!

1600
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:53,708
<i> ¡Ay, Tony, coño!</i>

1601
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:55,575
Not the balls, man!

1602
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:56,923
Oh, shit! Ow!

1603
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:58,247
Hey, hey, Tony.
Be careful, man.

1604
01:06:58,252 --> 01:06:59,992
What the fuck
are you doing?

1605
01:06:59,987 --> 01:07:01,087
You ok, Billy?

1606
01:07:01,087 --> 01:07:02,187
Hey, what the fuck
is wrong, fellas?

1607
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:03,229
He's wrong, Mike.

1608
01:07:03,234 --> 01:07:04,284
They're wrong--him
and nine lives.

1609
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:05,319
I seen them dealing
in the park together.

1610
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:06,355
They's both working
for Manny.

1611
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:07,959
Who's stupid now,
motherfucker?

1612
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,660
Mike. Mike,
I can explain.

1613
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:11,661
Please, Mike. Mike,
you got to listen to me.

1614
01:07:11,663 --> 01:07:13,403
Fucking listen
to me, man!

1615
01:07:13,398 --> 01:07:14,628
I'll fuck you up!

1616
01:07:14,632 --> 01:07:16,062
Tony: Listen to me, Mike.

1617
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,296
Mike! Put
the gun away, Mike.

1618
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,530
Put the fucking gun away!

1619
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,704
Ok, ok. I put it away.

1620
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:22,502
All right.

1621
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:31,105
Ok. Ok, now I'm
kind of confused, Tony,

1622
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:32,341
because I don't
remember you

1623
01:07:32,345 --> 01:07:33,575
telling me nothing
like that, right?

1624
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,550
Let me explain.

1625
01:07:34,547 --> 01:07:35,507
I remember
coming to Jersey

1626
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:36,684
when precious
got baptized.

1627
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:38,251
You told me you was
out of the life, right?

1628
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:40,519
You and Maxine,
you opened up a laundromat

1629
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:41,647
or some shit, right?

1630
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:42,681
Ok. So what
happened to that?

1631
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:43,965
I don't understand.

1632
01:07:43,969 --> 01:07:45,249
You understand how I could
be a little confused

1633
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:46,524
when you tell me
you out of the life?

1634
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,391
Now you tell me you
working for Manny, right?

1635
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:49,589
Mike, I'm sorry,
all right?

1636
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,640
Tony, I love you.

1637
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,690
I love you like you
was my own blood.

1638
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,432
<i> Te amo como mi sangre,</i>

1639
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:55,156
but if you're lying to me,
I swear to God,

1640
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:56,162
I will fucking kill you.

1641
01:07:56,163 --> 01:07:57,333
Fuck him.
Let's waste him,

1642
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,500
take his car, get
the fuck out of dodge

1643
01:07:58,498 --> 01:07:59,458
while we can, man.

1644
01:07:59,465 --> 01:08:01,255
[Cell phone ringing]

1645
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:06,536
Come on!

1646
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:08,297
Hold up.

1647
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:10,048
Hold up.

1648
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:11,565
What are you waiting for?
Fucking waste him.

1649
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:14,014
Hold up a minute,
all right?

1650
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:16,609
Go get the phone.

1651
01:08:22,116 --> 01:08:24,316
Torch...

1652
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:27,291
Check the pay phone.

1653
01:08:28,288 --> 01:08:31,218
Mike: You see
anybody there?

1654
01:08:31,224 --> 01:08:34,364
Bet your ass, Mr. Williams.

1655
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:38,358
Answer it.

1656
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,496
Yeah.

1657
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:47,471
[Busy signal]

1658
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,070
Yeah.

1659
01:08:54,075 --> 01:08:55,665
No.

1660
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:58,136
No. Uh-uh.

1661
01:08:58,145 --> 01:08:59,605
Not yet.

1662
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:02,313
Listen up,
you motherfucker.

1663
01:09:02,315 --> 01:09:05,545
Michael, it's Max.

1664
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:08,591
Max? Hey,
hey, Maxine.

1665
01:09:08,587 --> 01:09:10,317
How you doing, girl?

1666
01:09:10,322 --> 01:09:12,592
You know, how come you
always got to drag us

1667
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,120
into your bullshit,
Mikey?

1668
01:09:14,124 --> 01:09:16,124
We ain't even heard from
you for 2 or 3 years.

1669
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:17,786
Yeah, I know, Max,
but what can I do?

1670
01:09:17,794 --> 01:09:20,094
Debbie's my sister,
you know. I love her.

1671
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:20,896
I got to find her.

1672
01:09:20,896 --> 01:09:21,696
All right. I don't
want to hear

1673
01:09:21,697 --> 01:09:22,657
about your
fucking sister.

1674
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:24,334
Just put Tony
on the phone.

1675
01:09:24,332 --> 01:09:25,632
Come on, Maxine.
Don't be like that.

1676
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:28,733
Just put Tony
on the phone!

1677
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:31,636
Yeah, ok.

1678
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:33,568
Yeah, baby.

1679
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:35,813
I'm sorry, baby.

1680
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:39,437
Yeah, me, too.
You all right?

1681
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,313
Maxine,
are you all right?

1682
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:42,541
Yeah, I'm all right.

1683
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,545
How's my little girl?

1684
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:45,577
She's sleeping.

1685
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,611
Manny is singing
to her.

1686
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:51,746
You got to get us
out of here, baby.

1687
01:09:51,753 --> 01:09:54,393
You got to get us now.
He's singing to my baby.

1688
01:09:54,388 --> 01:09:56,548
You got to come and
get us right now.

1689
01:09:56,556 --> 01:10:00,786
Maxine, I'll do that
on my way home, ok?

1690
01:10:02,894 --> 01:10:05,464
I'm scared.

1691
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:07,633
I-I'm scared.

1692
01:10:07,631 --> 01:10:11,201
I'll be there
soon as I can.

1693
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:13,771
I just got to help
Mike out, that's all.

1694
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,640
Maxine: Do it.

1695
01:10:15,638 --> 01:10:16,948
Just do it, ok?

1696
01:10:16,955 --> 01:10:18,265
Just do what you got
to do, you hear me?

1697
01:10:18,273 --> 01:10:20,773
Just do what you
got to do.

1698
01:10:20,775 --> 01:10:22,735
Yeah, I hear you.

1699
01:10:22,743 --> 01:10:24,283
I love you.

1700
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:26,577
Love you, too, baby.

1701
01:10:32,517 --> 01:10:34,217
Maxine sounds
good, bro.

1702
01:10:34,218 --> 01:10:35,648
Sounds the same.

1703
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:38,552
She's the same old Max.

1704
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:40,217
So what?
His old lady called?

1705
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:41,491
That don't prove shit.

1706
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:42,748
Still don't mean he ain't
working for Manny.

1707
01:10:42,756 --> 01:10:44,616
I know, but we got
to be cool, right?

1708
01:10:44,624 --> 01:10:45,664
I'm through being cool.

1709
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,688
I say we fucking
waste him now.

1710
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:49,629
You just got to
calm down, ok?

1711
01:10:49,627 --> 01:10:51,157
Yeah.
Calm down, torch.

1712
01:10:51,161 --> 01:10:52,691
You already got two murder
beats hanging over your head.

1713
01:10:52,696 --> 01:10:54,296
I ain't interested
in being the third.

1714
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:57,357
The night is young,
motherfucker.

1715
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,300
Where are you
going, Tony?

1716
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:01,571
Where are you going?

1717
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:03,328
Ooh!

1718
01:11:03,336 --> 01:11:04,696
How your balls
feel there, fucko?

1719
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:05,974
Ok,<i> maricón.</i>

1720
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:07,971
Tell me
something, t.

1721
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,573
Come on.
Talk to me.

1722
01:11:10,575 --> 01:11:11,435
<i> Dime.</i>

1723
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:13,512
All right. All right.

1724
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,530
All right.

1725
01:11:15,528 --> 01:11:17,548
I started working for Manny
after we got out of riker's.

1726
01:11:17,547 --> 01:11:20,577
Me and nine lives were slinging
jobs over in seward park.

1727
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,353
Now, I never liked
being around him,

1728
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:23,631
but business is business.

1729
01:11:23,635 --> 01:11:24,915
We only worked together
for about a year.

1730
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,450
He could never stop
running his mouth

1731
01:11:26,454 --> 01:11:28,654
about how much money
he was going to be making,

1732
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:29,716
how Manny was going
to hook him up

1733
01:11:29,723 --> 01:11:31,023
with a franchise
of his own now.

1734
01:11:31,024 --> 01:11:32,824
You know
what I mean, Mike?

1735
01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:36,255
I kept my mouth shut
and went about my business,

1736
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:37,431
but Manny heard.

1737
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:38,588
Man, all the wolf tickets
that nine lives was selling

1738
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:40,296
decided to cash in on him.

1739
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:41,527
One day, I look up,

1740
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:42,761
walks up to nine lives
in seward park,

1741
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:44,266
shot him in the head.

1742
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:46,697
Then I come
into thinking, man,

1743
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,542
about getting
out of the life, you know?

1744
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,438
About getting
my shit together.

1745
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,740
Max was pregnant with
precious at the time, man.

1746
01:11:55,743 --> 01:11:59,853
I wanted to be around
to see my firstborn,

1747
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:01,477
so I went to Manny.

1748
01:12:01,481 --> 01:12:03,781
I told him how I was feeling
about my situation,

1749
01:12:03,783 --> 01:12:05,523
and he was cool, man,

1750
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:07,718
so I took my little bit
of chump change that I made

1751
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:09,919
from slinging them rocks,
and I stepped the fuck off,

1752
01:12:09,922 --> 01:12:10,922
moved to Jersey.

1753
01:12:10,923 --> 01:12:12,363
I got my little
storefront--

1754
01:12:12,357 --> 01:12:13,987
some washing machines,
a couple of dryers,

1755
01:12:13,991 --> 01:12:16,561
and that's when I went
into business for myself.

1756
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,030
So I swear to you, Mike,

1757
01:12:19,029 --> 01:12:21,599
on my little girl, man,

1758
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:23,968
I ain't had no further
conversations with Manny

1759
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:27,637
or fucking Freddie nine lives
or anybody else in the life

1760
01:12:27,637 --> 01:12:29,737
except for you.

1761
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:31,909
The only reason
I didn't tell you

1762
01:12:31,907 --> 01:12:36,677
was I didn't want
to let you down.

1763
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,005
Word is bond, man?

1764
01:12:39,013 --> 01:12:41,683
My word is bond.

1765
01:12:41,682 --> 01:12:43,582
Now she caught on
kind of fast

1766
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:44,783
as the months
rolled past.

1767
01:12:44,783 --> 01:12:45,983
Are we game
till the bitter end?

1768
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:48,715
A better ho
I have yet to know,

1769
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:51,621
and they claim a dog
is a man's best friend.

1770
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:55,093
She ran with the best,
from the east to the west.

1771
01:12:55,093 --> 01:12:57,333
I liked when her
boosting hand came down.

1772
01:12:57,328 --> 01:12:59,728
Many, many a chump
got left in the dumps

1773
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:02,000
as we stole from them
in all of them towns.

1774
01:13:01,998 --> 01:13:04,728
Yeah, I laid,
and I played

1775
01:13:04,734 --> 01:13:06,034
off the bread
this bitch made

1776
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:07,595
from the coast
to old Broadway.

1777
01:13:07,603 --> 01:13:09,743
My habits were small,
and the money was tall.

1778
01:13:09,738 --> 01:13:11,798
I really made
this business pay.

1779
01:13:11,806 --> 01:13:13,536
Torch: What a fucking
fairy tale.

1780
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:14,611
Don't believe him.
Don't believe him.

1781
01:13:14,608 --> 01:13:15,788
He's only trying
to save his ass.

1782
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:16,982
We're going to have
to trust him.

1783
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:17,737
Why?

1784
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:18,794
Because I say so.

1785
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:19,844
Look. Fuck that.
Give me the piece.

1786
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:20,894
You don't want to do him?
I'll do him.

1787
01:13:20,894 --> 01:13:21,944
How many fucking times
I got to tell you "no"?

1788
01:13:21,948 --> 01:13:23,548
We ain't going
to do it your way.

1789
01:13:23,549 --> 01:13:24,649
Why the fuck not?

1790
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:25,749
Look. If I was
working for Manny,

1791
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:26,821
you'd be dead already.

1792
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:27,678
Ah, yeah. Maybe.

1793
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:28,715
Ain't no maybe about it

1794
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,449
because the longer
you sit here,

1795
01:13:30,454 --> 01:13:33,564
it's only a matter of time
before he finds you.

1796
01:13:33,557 --> 01:13:34,987
Come on. Think
for a minute, man.

1797
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:36,421
Use your head. Maybe
he's telling the truth.

1798
01:13:36,426 --> 01:13:37,486
Yeah, maybe, but--

1799
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:38,563
come on. I want you
to trust me on this,

1800
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:39,611
all right?

1801
01:13:39,606 --> 01:13:40,646
I've known this guy
over half my life.

1802
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:41,701
If he says he quit
Manny, I believe him.

1803
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:43,057
Ok. We let him
live for now.

1804
01:13:43,065 --> 01:13:46,465
I still don't
like you, motherfucker.

1805
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:47,668
Check the pay phone.

1806
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:51,899
See if our friend
is still there.

1807
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:36,851
Mike.

1808
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:38,716
Why heroin, man?

1809
01:14:38,717 --> 01:14:40,717
Thought you'd stay
away from that shit.

1810
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,689
Debbie being
a dope fiend, and all.

1811
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,047
I told you before, Tony.

1812
01:14:44,054 --> 01:14:45,424
My sister ain't got
nothing to do with this.

1813
01:14:45,423 --> 01:14:46,583
You understand me?

1814
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:47,729
Debbie's clean.
She's clean.

1815
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:48,885
Oh, she's clean?
I didn't know that, man.

1816
01:14:48,893 --> 01:14:50,663
That's really beautiful.

1817
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,430
How's she doing anyway?
Where she at?

1818
01:14:52,429 --> 01:14:53,479
Arizona.

1819
01:14:53,485 --> 01:14:54,535
They got some kind of
rehab program out there.

1820
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:55,601
Yeah? What's it like
in Arizona?

1821
01:14:55,598 --> 01:14:56,728
How the fuck
should I know?

1822
01:14:56,732 --> 01:14:58,002
Thought maybe your
sister might call you

1823
01:14:57,999 --> 01:14:58,959
or write you
or something.

1824
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:00,276
Jeez, it's
a normal question.

1825
01:15:00,283 --> 01:15:01,603
People have families,
they try to stick close,

1826
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:02,681
that's all.

1827
01:15:02,684 --> 01:15:03,774
Oh, so now you want to
talk about family, right?

1828
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:04,629
Forget it!

1829
01:15:04,636 --> 01:15:06,386
Yeah. Thought so.

1830
01:15:06,387 --> 01:15:08,137
If it wasn't your idea,
whose was it? Nine lives?

1831
01:15:08,139 --> 01:15:09,039
No, it was mine.

1832
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,089
That fucking figures.

1833
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,139
Fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1834
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:12,641
How's your cold,
my man?

1835
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:13,782
Fuck you.

1836
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:14,906
Don't fuck with me.
How's your cold, junkie?

1837
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,040
Hey, Tony, what the fuck
you talking about?

1838
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:17,135
I'm talking
about your boy there.

1839
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,106
Can't you see
he's jonesing?

1840
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:19,083
Don't listen to
this guy, Mike.

1841
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,050
He's full of shit.
He doesn't know

1842
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,608
what the fuck
he's talking about.

1843
01:15:21,615 --> 01:15:23,175
He ain't no junkie, Tony.
He's just got a cold.

1844
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:24,024
That's all.

1845
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:25,018
Wake the fuck up, bro.

1846
01:15:25,019 --> 01:15:26,939
Boy's got the chills.

1847
01:15:26,937 --> 01:15:28,847
His nose is running like
a fucking v-8 engine.

1848
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:29,986
Got no tracks,
motherfucker.

1849
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,020
See, Mike?
No tracks.

1850
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:32,094
What about your feet?

1851
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:32,961
What about them?

1852
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:34,438
I peeked them after you

1853
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:35,932
had your little accident,
stupid-ass junkie.

1854
01:15:35,927 --> 01:15:38,627
Should have killed you
when I had the chance,

1855
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:40,829
you motherfucker.

1856
01:15:41,898 --> 01:15:43,198
Aah!

1857
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:44,849
Aah!

1858
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:46,500
Mother, sit your
fucking ass down.

1859
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:47,172
Come on, man.

1860
01:15:47,169 --> 01:15:48,519
Check his feet, Mike.

1861
01:15:48,519 --> 01:15:49,869
If you don't believe me,
check out his fucking feet.

1862
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:50,951
Get off me,
man! Ow!

1863
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:52,044
I swear to God,
Mike. No lie.

1864
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:53,639
Check out
his fucking feet.

1865
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,710
Ow! Get the fu--
ow! Fuck! Ow!

1866
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:57,959
It ain't what
it looks like, Mike.

1867
01:15:57,959 --> 01:15:59,209
I swear to God,
it ain't that bad.

1868
01:15:59,211 --> 01:16:01,541
Man, I'm just chipping,
that's all.

1869
01:16:01,546 --> 01:16:03,146
Ow. Fuck!
Let me up, man.

1870
01:16:03,147 --> 01:16:05,747
Everybody in my family
got to be hooked on dope.

1871
01:16:05,749 --> 01:16:07,049
You related to
this asshole?

1872
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,330
He's my brother, man.

1873
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:09,624
Half brother,
you fucking prick.

1874
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:10,619
Shut the fuck up!

1875
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:11,940
Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow!

1876
01:16:11,937 --> 01:16:13,247
What's the matter,
junkie? You sick?

1877
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:14,845
Say "please,"
dope fiend.

1878
01:16:14,856 --> 01:16:16,086
Say "please"!

1879
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,720
Leave him alone.

1880
01:16:17,724 --> 01:16:20,494
Ow!

1881
01:16:22,727 --> 01:16:25,027
Oh, Mike. That
fucking hurt, Mike.

1882
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:28,699
Oh, man, you got to
fucking help me, man.

1883
01:16:28,699 --> 01:16:32,669
Ok. Ok. I got you.
I got you, all right?

1884
01:16:32,669 --> 01:16:33,829
We're brothers, right?

1885
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:35,036
<i> Somos hermanos ¿verdad?</i>

1886
01:16:35,037 --> 01:16:36,997
We got to look after
each other, right?

1887
01:16:37,005 --> 01:16:38,955
Damn, Mike.

1888
01:16:38,956 --> 01:16:40,906
I ain't even know
you had a brother,

1889
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:43,008
let alone
one who was...

1890
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,740
Well, you know it.

1891
01:16:45,746 --> 01:16:49,276
I'm sorry, all right?

1892
01:16:50,716 --> 01:16:52,046
Tony: I'm sorry, man.

1893
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:54,280
So you all never
met before, right?

1894
01:16:54,285 --> 01:16:57,115
You never knew anything
about each other

1895
01:16:57,121 --> 01:16:58,791
or nothing?

1896
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:00,089
Damn.

1897
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,820
Your pops was a player.

1898
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,555
Yeah. I'd like to kill him
for what he did

1899
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,790
to me and my mother.

1900
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:06,034
He didn't break
your mother's heart

1901
01:17:06,028 --> 01:17:07,258
by knocking up some poor
bitch from the projects.

1902
01:17:07,263 --> 01:17:09,533
Hey, listen. You can
talk about your father

1903
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,931
any way
you want to, ok?

1904
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:12,232
But when you talk
about my mother,

1905
01:17:12,232 --> 01:17:13,532
you better show her
some fucking respect.

1906
01:17:13,534 --> 01:17:15,004
<i> ¿Oiste?</i> You heard
what I said?

1907
01:17:15,002 --> 01:17:18,102
Yeah, yeah. I heard you
twice the first time.

1908
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:19,195
Let me tell you
something

1909
01:17:19,206 --> 01:17:21,736
about your
old man, Mike.

1910
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:23,541
When I was
in high school,

1911
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:24,872
I was a complete
fucking ignoramus

1912
01:17:24,876 --> 01:17:27,636
when it came to reading,
writing, arithmetic,

1913
01:17:27,645 --> 01:17:29,775
but I always got
good grades in math.

1914
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,380
You know why?

1915
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:34,982
Because the old man was
fucking my math teacher.

1916
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:36,215
Miss delvecchio.

1917
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,549
Never paid attention

1918
01:17:37,553 --> 01:17:40,223
to what we were
supposed to be learning,

1919
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,223
so she calls my parents

1920
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:44,334
to have a meeting
about my grades.

1921
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:46,887
So the old man comes
down to the school,

1922
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:48,146
off we go

1923
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:49,396
to the guidance
counselor's office.

1924
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:52,128
So after about 5, 10
minutes of conversation

1925
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,804
about my grades,
my attitude,

1926
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,002
my attention span,
whatever,

1927
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,844
she goes to me
and Mr. d.,

1928
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:58,969
"would you gentlemen
step outside

1929
01:17:58,973 --> 01:18:01,843
so I can talk to
Mr. Murphy in private?"

1930
01:18:01,842 --> 01:18:05,212
So I'm sitting in class
just after she came in.

1931
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:06,952
I remember thinking,

1932
01:18:06,946 --> 01:18:08,676
"there's something
different about her."

1933
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:11,052
She was always kind of
an uptight broad,

1934
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:13,721
wore her hair
pinned up in a bun.

1935
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,850
She comes back from
talking to the old man.

1936
01:18:16,856 --> 01:18:18,086
All of a sudden
she's wearing it

1937
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,360
down around her
shoulders.

1938
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:20,817
You know, like
out of nowhere,

1939
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:22,825
she's all relaxed.

1940
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,687
She's got that
well-fucked look,

1941
01:18:24,695 --> 01:18:25,825
you know?

1942
01:18:25,828 --> 01:18:26,958
She never said
another word to me

1943
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:29,133
for the rest
of the year,

1944
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:30,731
not a fucking word
except,

1945
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:31,832
"thank you, Mr. Murphy,"

1946
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,933
when I handed in
my test,

1947
01:18:32,934 --> 01:18:34,804
and that was the reason

1948
01:18:34,802 --> 01:18:38,172
I suddenly became
a mathematical genius.

1949
01:18:40,706 --> 01:18:44,736
Broke my mother's heart.

1950
01:18:44,743 --> 01:18:47,233
Because I knew about it,

1951
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:49,708
I could never look her
in her eyes again.

1952
01:18:49,714 --> 01:18:52,854
Now I ain't going
to sit here and tell you

1953
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,850
that he didn't give you
and your poor mother

1954
01:18:54,852 --> 01:18:56,142
a hard way to go,

1955
01:18:56,141 --> 01:18:57,431
but me and my mother
put up with more

1956
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,720
of his bullshit
on a day-to-day basis

1957
01:18:58,722 --> 01:19:01,862
than you could ever
imagine, Mike.

1958
01:19:01,858 --> 01:19:04,288
So believe me
when I tell you

1959
01:19:04,293 --> 01:19:08,163
I know
how you feel, bro.

1960
01:19:08,163 --> 01:19:10,903
Believe me, man, I do.

1961
01:19:10,899 --> 01:19:12,969
Damn.

1962
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,830
That's fucked up,
yo.

1963
01:19:16,969 --> 01:19:18,939
Tony: Now, you know
how some bitches cry

1964
01:19:18,937 --> 01:19:22,367
about the wind being high,
cops being on their trail,

1965
01:19:22,373 --> 01:19:25,943
about the snow and the sleet
being asshole-deep

1966
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:28,443
and all the pimps
can go to hell.

1967
01:19:28,445 --> 01:19:30,975
Sitting in greasy spoons,
jukebox saloons,

1968
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,080
killing a lot of time,

1969
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:34,451
sucking on beers,
crying hard-luck tears

1970
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:37,380
while the pimps
ain't got a dime.

1971
01:19:37,386 --> 01:19:38,486
Both: Just sitting

1972
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:40,447
and bullshitting,

1973
01:19:40,455 --> 01:19:42,285
sucking them
party friends.

1974
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,490
Nodding so tough--
they're out messing with stuff--

1975
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:47,392
that they miss
all the righteous tricks.

1976
01:19:47,394 --> 01:19:49,594
Why, you could
lap their lid

1977
01:19:49,595 --> 01:19:51,795
for the lowest bid,
set that young ass on fire--

1978
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:54,828
the cheapest young girl
you could buy.

1979
01:19:54,834 --> 01:19:57,504
Digging that cunt
for a solid month

1980
01:19:57,503 --> 01:20:00,943
while it's dope that's been
doing all the pimping.

1981
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:04,209
But not this triple-a
broad of mine.

1982
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:07,538
She was a sex machine
that could walk between

1983
01:20:07,544 --> 01:20:11,854
raindrops come typhoon,
blizzard, or Gale.

1984
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,778
Standing on the hot brick,
she'd turn a trick.

1985
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:17,054
Man, she'd trick
with creeps and freaks,

1986
01:20:17,052 --> 01:20:20,822
toenail creeps,
breeds I can't even name,

1987
01:20:20,822 --> 01:20:24,562
eskimo, negroes, Jews,
apache, sioux.

1988
01:20:24,559 --> 01:20:27,529
To her, it was
all the same.

1989
01:20:27,528 --> 01:20:30,828
Any way she would follow
that righteous dollar

1990
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,961
to hell if she had to go.

1991
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:35,066
And be down there
just waiting

1992
01:20:35,068 --> 01:20:36,328
that trick with Satan.

1993
01:20:36,335 --> 01:20:38,125
She was really
a money-making ho.

1994
01:20:38,136 --> 01:20:40,996
Why, for a lick or a lap
of that mental trap,

1995
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:42,495
the tricks defied her due.

1996
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:45,466
Of course, her longest bread
was made by head,

1997
01:20:45,475 --> 01:20:48,405
and, Jim, how that bitch
could chew.

1998
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,841
Now all my troubles began,

1999
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:55,306
and I quit snorting
and commenced the hit.

2000
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:57,816
Now, you know
how that go.

2001
01:20:57,818 --> 01:21:01,918
I shot up more dope
than any one bitch could get.

2002
01:21:01,922 --> 01:21:05,522
I sold my shack, my Cadillac,

2003
01:21:05,525 --> 01:21:07,115
the rug from up off my floor.

2004
01:21:07,126 --> 01:21:09,026
I stole from ma and pa,

2005
01:21:09,027 --> 01:21:10,387
and I shot up all that dough.

2006
01:21:10,395 --> 01:21:12,855
My woman cried
and damn near died

2007
01:21:12,864 --> 01:21:14,434
when I ran up with her mink,

2008
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:17,832
but I stayed in my role,

2009
01:21:17,834 --> 01:21:21,244
and I stole, and I sold
everything but the kitchen sink.

2010
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:25,308
Down I fell
to the depths of hell.

2011
01:21:25,308 --> 01:21:28,308
I had put myself in a cross.

2012
01:21:28,311 --> 01:21:31,411
My habits got tall,
my money got small,

2013
01:21:31,414 --> 01:21:34,284
but the deadliest blow of all

2014
01:21:34,282 --> 01:21:37,152
came when this bitch
took ill on short notice

2015
01:21:37,152 --> 01:21:39,592
and could no longer gin.

2016
01:21:39,587 --> 01:21:42,087
Her head was dead,
her ass was red,

2017
01:21:42,089 --> 01:21:44,489
the lips on her cunt
was cold.

2018
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:46,511
I figured, what the hell,

2019
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:48,529
since the bitch ain't well,
I'll get me a wife-in-law.

2020
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:52,098
Now there's this redhead bitch
with a whorehouse itch

2021
01:21:52,098 --> 01:21:53,898
over in Bernie Willis' stable.

2022
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:56,479
I call her big mabel,

2023
01:21:56,484 --> 01:21:59,074
do my best while you convalesce,
get back on your feet again.

2024
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:01,440
"Like hell," she cried.

2025
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:04,369
"I'll see you dead
before I see you go.

2026
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:08,605
"May the black coach of sorrow
pick your ass up tomorrow

2027
01:22:08,612 --> 01:22:10,452
"if you walk beyond that door.

2028
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:13,107
"Now, I ruined my health
and a bid for wealth

2029
01:22:13,116 --> 01:22:14,476
"so that you
could have your bed.

2030
01:22:14,484 --> 01:22:16,654
"But you done
went dopehead--

2031
01:22:16,652 --> 01:22:17,922
"shot up all of that bread.

2032
01:22:17,919 --> 01:22:19,519
"Now, you talking
that stable shit?

2033
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,620
"But you see,
I'm wise to the lines

2034
01:22:21,622 --> 01:22:23,522
"that you pimps
drop on the frails

2035
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:25,193
"and the games
you try to play,

2036
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:29,461
"and if this shit
don't cease like motherfucker,

2037
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:30,891
"I'm calling the po-lice.

2038
01:22:30,895 --> 01:22:33,625
Have them carry
your ass away."

2039
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:36,601
Well, I just kept on
fixing my shit

2040
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,530
because I was aiming to split.

2041
01:22:38,535 --> 01:22:40,265
This is what I said.

2042
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,070
Mike:
What did you say?

2043
01:22:42,071 --> 01:22:45,141
"Bitch, you ain't no lady.

2044
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:48,910
"You know the game,
but they call it cop and blow.

2045
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,680
"You done had your run,
and now you're done.

2046
01:22:50,678 --> 01:22:52,358
"I'm going to find me
another ho.

2047
01:22:52,362 --> 01:22:54,052
"Now, wouldn't I look silly
with a broke-down filly

2048
01:22:54,048 --> 01:22:55,548
on a track that
was way too fast?"

2049
01:22:55,549 --> 01:22:57,069
Mike: Mm-hmm.

2050
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:58,576
"Besides, a bitch ain't shit
without a good man's wit,

2051
01:22:58,585 --> 01:23:00,275
"and your thoroughbred
days are past.

2052
01:23:00,286 --> 01:23:03,546
"No, I'll put you in charge
of my whorehouse at large,

2053
01:23:03,555 --> 01:23:04,985
"give some girls the rule.

2054
01:23:04,989 --> 01:23:06,419
"But you sound like hell

2055
01:23:06,423 --> 01:23:08,523
"talking about
putting me in jail,

2056
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:12,485
"you must be
a goddamn fool, bitch.

2057
01:23:12,495 --> 01:23:15,355
"Step aside. Let me slide.

2058
01:23:15,364 --> 01:23:18,504
Hurry up. Get off my back."

2059
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,496
"I'm going to find me
another young woman

2060
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:22,131
who can run
the real fast track."

2061
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:26,095
Now I lean on my back
in another ho's shack

2062
01:23:26,105 --> 01:23:27,495
running down my pedigree.

2063
01:23:27,506 --> 01:23:31,066
We heard a tremendous thunder
that shook the door under,

2064
01:23:31,076 --> 01:23:34,376
and I'm wondering
who in the fuck that could be.

2065
01:23:34,379 --> 01:23:36,679
Just then a policeman walked in

2066
01:23:36,681 --> 01:23:40,681
with a great big grin
fixed in a deadly expression.

2067
01:23:40,685 --> 01:23:44,345
Wants to know,
"your name rock?"

2068
01:23:44,355 --> 01:23:45,545
"Pimping rock."

2069
01:23:45,556 --> 01:23:48,056
"Hurry up.
Sign this confession."

2070
01:23:48,058 --> 01:23:50,388
"That's him," she cried,

2071
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:52,693
swinging her arms
in the deepest of glee.

2072
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:56,525
"That's the dirty son of a bitch
with the con man pitch

2073
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,502
that made a stinking ho
out of me."

2074
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:02,300
Just then, a deadly blow
knocked me to the floor,

2075
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:05,373
and I fell into a black repose.

2076
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:09,412
When I awoke, my jaw was broke.

2077
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:12,009
Blood was all over my clothes.

2078
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:17,651
And that's the tale that I tell
from my prison cell,

2079
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,619
sitting here on my bed.

2080
01:24:19,617 --> 01:24:23,747
Murder one, possession of a gun,

2081
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:30,224
and, yeah, I shot that
stinking bitch dead.

2082
01:24:30,226 --> 01:24:33,526
[Gunshots]

2083
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:49,509
Torch: I'm really
sick, Mike.

2084
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:51,710
You got
to help me.

2085
01:24:54,114 --> 01:24:57,684
Mike, I'm really
fucking sick, man.

2086
01:24:57,684 --> 01:25:00,154
You got to just let me
have a little taste.

2087
01:25:00,153 --> 01:25:01,343
No way, man.

2088
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:02,517
No way I can let you
have any of that shit.

2089
01:25:02,522 --> 01:25:03,652
I just need
a little bit, man.

2090
01:25:03,656 --> 01:25:05,256
That's all.
I just need a little bit.

2091
01:25:05,257 --> 01:25:06,617
Sorry. You got to
excuse me, bro,

2092
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,315
but I can't let you
do that. All right?

2093
01:25:08,326 --> 01:25:10,656
I'm going
to be sick.

2094
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:13,191
Hey. Come on.
Billy?

2095
01:25:13,196 --> 01:25:14,596
Billy.

2096
01:25:14,597 --> 01:25:17,457
You ok? Huh?
You ok, bro?

2097
01:25:17,466 --> 01:25:18,666
You all right?

2098
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,297
Oh, shit.

2099
01:25:21,302 --> 01:25:23,272
[Coughing]

2100
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,420
Shh.

2101
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,570
Motherfucker, let me
have a little bit, man.

2102
01:25:25,572 --> 01:25:26,642
I just need
a little bit.

2103
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,509
Come on, man.
I need a little bit.

2104
01:25:28,507 --> 01:25:29,537
Come on.

2105
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,570
I don't fix soon,
I'm going to fucking die.

2106
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:31,605
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

2107
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:32,639
Don't say that.

2108
01:25:32,643 --> 01:25:33,583
You ain't
going to die.

2109
01:25:33,577 --> 01:25:34,637
He's going to wish
he was dead

2110
01:25:34,644 --> 01:25:36,144
if he don't
get straight.

2111
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:37,305
It still don't
make no sense

2112
01:25:37,312 --> 01:25:39,112
in putting that shit
in his veins, Tony.

2113
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:40,183
He ain't going
to get better

2114
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,910
no time soon
without it.

2115
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:43,654
Torch, when's the last
time you fixed?

2116
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:44,720
Yesterday.

2117
01:25:44,717 --> 01:25:45,777
Come on, Mike.
I'm fucking sick, man.

2118
01:25:45,785 --> 01:25:46,675
Come on.

2119
01:25:46,685 --> 01:25:47,865
Man, why
I got to have

2120
01:25:47,869 --> 01:25:49,049
a dopesick junkie
for a brother?

2121
01:25:49,054 --> 01:25:50,154
Huh?

2122
01:25:50,154 --> 01:25:51,254
You don't want
him to be sick?

2123
01:25:51,256 --> 01:25:52,656
Let him fix.

2124
01:25:52,657 --> 01:25:54,617
[Moaning]

2125
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,143
Ok.

2126
01:25:58,143 --> 01:25:59,593
Ok. Go ahead.
<i> Comé mierda.</i>

2127
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:01,455
Put that fucking
poison in your body.

2128
01:26:01,463 --> 01:26:02,803
Why the fuck
should I care?

2129
01:26:02,797 --> 01:26:03,697
Come on.

2130
01:26:03,697 --> 01:26:05,127
Sit over here.

2131
01:26:05,131 --> 01:26:06,231
Thanks, bro.

2132
01:26:06,232 --> 01:26:08,202
Don't call me that.

2133
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,370
Sh--

2134
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:10,267
I'm sorry, bro.

2135
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:11,667
Hey, don't
call me that.

2136
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:12,668
Aah!
Mike!

2137
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:13,599
You heard
what I said?

2138
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:14,773
Don't you ever
call me that

2139
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,240
as long as you live.

2140
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:17,398
Aah!

2141
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:18,835
Mike!

2142
01:26:18,839 --> 01:26:20,269
First my sister.
Now this fucking shit?

2143
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,705
Put your head
out the window, man.

2144
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:22,689
You need to chill.

2145
01:26:22,692 --> 01:26:23,672
You're only
my half brother anyway.

2146
01:26:23,677 --> 01:26:24,937
I don't even know why

2147
01:26:24,944 --> 01:26:26,214
I thought that shit
meant anything to me.

2148
01:26:26,212 --> 01:26:28,582
Get the fuck out.

2149
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:32,576
Fuck.

2150
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:33,883
You got your
works, baby?

2151
01:26:33,884 --> 01:26:35,754
Yeah, in my jacket.

2152
01:26:36,652 --> 01:26:38,352
All right.

2153
01:26:39,721 --> 01:26:42,561
[Moans]

2154
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:01,209
Fuck.

2155
01:27:02,742 --> 01:27:05,282
You guys got
to help me, man.

2156
01:27:05,277 --> 01:27:07,337
My hand don't
work no more.

2157
01:27:07,345 --> 01:27:09,375
I can't do this one
by myself.

2158
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,780
Don't you even
fucking look at me.

2159
01:27:11,782 --> 01:27:13,382
I hope that
shit kills you.

2160
01:27:13,383 --> 01:27:15,453
Don't say that.

2161
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,790
I got it, baby.

2162
01:27:21,655 --> 01:27:22,585
What you need?

2163
01:27:22,589 --> 01:27:23,589
I just need you

2164
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:26,290
to hook it up
for me.

2165
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:28,492
Ok.

2166
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:39,266
Like this?

2167
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:40,800
Yeah, that's good.

2168
01:27:48,944 --> 01:27:50,944
Hey, Tony, man...

2169
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:54,347
Thanks.

2170
01:27:54,348 --> 01:27:56,278
No problem.

2171
01:28:00,453 --> 01:28:01,723
I'm sorry about
throwing up on you.

2172
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,590
It's just when I get
sick like this,

2173
01:28:04,589 --> 01:28:06,419
I can't help myself.

2174
01:28:08,592 --> 01:28:09,592
And you, too, Mike.

2175
01:28:09,593 --> 01:28:11,693
I'm sorry about
pissing my pants

2176
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:13,525
in front of your
friend here, man.

2177
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,630
Hope I didn't
embarrass you.

2178
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:16,261
It's just
when I get sick,

2179
01:28:16,265 --> 01:28:17,755
I can't help...

2180
01:28:45,927 --> 01:28:46,857
Torch: Come on, man.

2181
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:47,991
Don't look at me
like that.

2182
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:49,625
I hate it
when people

2183
01:28:49,629 --> 01:28:51,459
look at me
like that.

2184
01:28:52,698 --> 01:28:55,628
Don't fucking look
at me like that.

2185
01:28:55,634 --> 01:28:58,034
What you do that
shit for anyway, man?

2186
01:28:58,036 --> 01:28:58,826
I don't know.

2187
01:28:58,836 --> 01:29:00,636
Because it's
all I got.

2188
01:29:00,637 --> 01:29:01,637
That's bullshit.

2189
01:29:01,638 --> 01:29:03,538
No, it's not
bullshit.

2190
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:04,669
It's not bullshit.

2191
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,573
You are
bullshit, man.

2192
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:07,644
You're bullshit.

2193
01:29:07,641 --> 01:29:08,971
Oh, no, I
almost forgot,

2194
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:10,705
you're my long lost
half brother, right?

2195
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:13,340
You tell me, what
else have I got?

2196
01:29:13,345 --> 01:29:15,645
I got no
real family.

2197
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:16,807
Got no job.

2198
01:29:16,814 --> 01:29:18,914
Ain't been able
to keep one

2199
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:19,826
the past 5 years.

2200
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:20,753
Last job I had,
I missed

2201
01:29:20,751 --> 01:29:22,421
so many workdays
from being sick,

2202
01:29:22,419 --> 01:29:23,499
I said "fuck it."

2203
01:29:23,502 --> 01:29:24,582
Started stealing
full-time

2204
01:29:24,587 --> 01:29:25,587
to support my habit.

2205
01:29:25,588 --> 01:29:26,718
It's part
of the reason

2206
01:29:26,722 --> 01:29:28,862
I started hitting
myself in the feet.

2207
01:29:28,857 --> 01:29:30,757
This way, I don't
got to walk around

2208
01:29:30,758 --> 01:29:31,788
wearing long sleeves
all the time.

2209
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:33,422
Sure, you know,
it gets messy--

2210
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:34,406
walking around,

2211
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:35,389
blood dripping
out of your shoe.

2212
01:29:35,394 --> 01:29:36,934
It's easy to hide.

2213
01:29:37,595 --> 01:29:38,755
You want to know
why, Mike?

2214
01:29:38,762 --> 01:29:40,532
You really want
to know why

2215
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:41,630
I shoot dope?

2216
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:42,801
Because I have to.

2217
01:29:42,798 --> 01:29:44,528
The colds,
they come.

2218
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:45,673
I don't,
I get sick.

2219
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:47,997
You ever been sick?

2220
01:29:48,002 --> 01:29:49,772
So fucking sick your
whole body aches,

2221
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:51,540
your guts feel like
it's on fire,

2222
01:29:51,538 --> 01:29:52,518
your blood's
boiling?

2223
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:53,501
There's not
a fucking thing

2224
01:29:53,506 --> 01:29:54,606
in the whole
wide world

2225
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:55,687
you can do about it.

2226
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:56,770
It's not
a good feeling, bro.

2227
01:29:56,775 --> 01:29:58,365
Stop looking at me
like that.

2228
01:29:58,376 --> 01:30:00,736
20/20 my ass.

2229
01:30:00,745 --> 01:30:02,505
Yeah, you got eyes

2230
01:30:02,513 --> 01:30:03,713
in the back
of your head.

2231
01:30:03,714 --> 01:30:04,884
You got any idea
what it's like

2232
01:30:04,881 --> 01:30:06,111
to want to quit and
know that you can't?

2233
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:08,075
Like you really,
really want to quit,

2234
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:09,773
but you just can't?

2235
01:30:09,767 --> 01:30:11,447
Like in the past
5 years alone,

2236
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,423
I tried to kick
3 different times.

2237
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:15,721
Cold Turkey
the first time.

2238
01:30:15,723 --> 01:30:17,623
Next two times,

2239
01:30:17,624 --> 01:30:19,494
tried a 10-day
methadone program

2240
01:30:19,492 --> 01:30:20,762
they got
over in Brooklyn.

2241
01:30:20,759 --> 01:30:22,589
I had 7 out of 10
days clean

2242
01:30:22,594 --> 01:30:23,764
on my first
go-around.

2243
01:30:23,761 --> 01:30:26,731
Big fucking deal,
right?

2244
01:30:29,432 --> 01:30:32,372
Next time,
two years later,

2245
01:30:32,368 --> 01:30:35,438
on the 11th day,
my girlfriend pattie

2246
01:30:35,437 --> 01:30:36,437
came to pick
me up.

2247
01:30:36,438 --> 01:30:38,838
Off we went
to cup.

2248
01:30:39,073 --> 01:30:40,813
I had 11 days clean,

2249
01:30:40,808 --> 01:30:43,008
$60 in my pocket.

2250
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,540
Bought 5
bags of dope,

2251
01:30:45,545 --> 01:30:46,475
a pack
of cigarettes.

2252
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,449
Shot them up
just like...

2253
01:31:14,606 --> 01:31:17,006
I remember the high
I got from that shit

2254
01:31:17,008 --> 01:31:19,478
like it was
yesterday.

2255
01:31:27,784 --> 01:31:31,894
Felt like
superman.

2256
01:31:31,888 --> 01:31:34,648
Invincible,
you know?

2257
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,089
Here I come,
man...

2258
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:42,634
Looking at you
with those eyes.

2259
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:44,599
Only it
wasn't your face

2260
01:31:44,597 --> 01:31:45,657
I'd be looking at.

2261
01:31:45,664 --> 01:31:46,704
It was my own.

2262
01:31:46,698 --> 01:31:49,168
I'd be staring
in the mirror,

2263
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:49,997
begging and crying

2264
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:51,601
for him
to let me stop,

2265
01:31:51,602 --> 01:31:52,852
but he wouldn't.

2266
01:31:52,852 --> 01:31:54,102
Just kept
staring back at me

2267
01:31:54,104 --> 01:31:55,774
with this look
on his face

2268
01:31:55,772 --> 01:31:56,992
that's saying,

2269
01:31:56,989 --> 01:31:58,209
"who's that crazy
strung-out junkie

2270
01:31:58,207 --> 01:31:59,457
"looking at me?

2271
01:31:59,457 --> 01:32:00,707
"Can't be who
I think it is.

2272
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:02,579
"I don't look
like that, do I?

2273
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:04,737
"This guy looks
dangerous.

2274
01:32:04,745 --> 01:32:06,605
"Too dangerous to be
on the street.

2275
01:32:06,613 --> 01:32:08,783
Too dangerous
to be me."

2276
01:32:08,781 --> 01:32:10,651
But it is you.

2277
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:12,879
It's you exactly
the way you are,

2278
01:32:12,884 --> 01:32:13,784
sure as shit.

2279
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:15,954
What scares you
the most is,

2280
01:32:15,952 --> 01:32:17,022
that's what
people see

2281
01:32:17,019 --> 01:32:18,589
when they
look at you

2282
01:32:18,587 --> 01:32:21,487
the way you
look at me.

2283
01:32:30,964 --> 01:32:33,134
Whoa.

2284
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:37,003
Mike?

2285
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:41,071
I'm not feeling
too good, man.

2286
01:32:45,508 --> 01:32:48,978
Mike: Billy, stop
fucking around, man.

2287
01:32:52,246 --> 01:32:54,006
Billy?

2288
01:32:55,215 --> 01:32:56,675
Billy?

2289
01:32:56,683 --> 01:32:59,583
[Slapping Billy]

2290
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:03,918
Ok, um...

2291
01:33:03,921 --> 01:33:05,941
Ok.

2292
01:33:05,939 --> 01:33:07,959
I got to pick
you up. All right?

2293
01:33:09,592 --> 01:33:11,492
We're going to walk,
Billy. Come on.

2294
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:13,693
Going to walk
with me, bro?

2295
01:33:13,695 --> 01:33:15,825
That's it, huh?
Come on.

2296
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:22,631
What's the difference
between the police

2297
01:33:22,636 --> 01:33:24,596
and the po-lice?

2298
01:33:24,604 --> 01:33:25,974
No idea.

2299
01:33:25,972 --> 01:33:28,642
Well, obviously
you've never

2300
01:33:28,641 --> 01:33:30,641
been chased
by them.

2301
01:33:32,578 --> 01:33:34,778
Come on, Billy.

2302
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:36,810
Come on.

2303
01:33:36,814 --> 01:33:38,784
Come on, Mike.
Look at you.

2304
01:33:38,782 --> 01:33:40,852
What you
look like, man?

2305
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:43,980
Tony, you're supposed
to be helping me, man.

2306
01:33:43,986 --> 01:33:45,816
Oh, I'm supposed
to be helping you?

2307
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:47,691
Ain't that a bitch?

2308
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:49,059
Don't move, Billy.

2309
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:51,087
You stay
right there.

2310
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:52,932
I'm going to fix
you up, ok?

2311
01:33:52,928 --> 01:33:54,828
We're going
to fix you up.

2312
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:55,829
Ok.

2313
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,160
Come on.
Don't be dead.

2314
01:33:58,732 --> 01:33:59,762
Come on.
Don't be dead.

2315
01:33:59,766 --> 01:34:01,026
Don't be dead, ok?

2316
01:34:01,033 --> 01:34:03,733
Billy, Billy,
don't be dead, ok?

2317
01:34:03,735 --> 01:34:05,465
Come on.

2318
01:34:05,469 --> 01:34:07,199
It's supposed
to be my dope.

2319
01:34:12,676 --> 01:34:13,366
Yeah.

2320
01:34:13,376 --> 01:34:14,906
The dope you stole?

2321
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,240
Mine.

2322
01:34:16,244 --> 01:34:17,464
But you said--

2323
01:34:17,461 --> 01:34:18,681
you said you
was out of the life.

2324
01:34:18,679 --> 01:34:20,259
Oh, come on, Mike.

2325
01:34:20,263 --> 01:34:21,853
Once in the life,
always in the life.

2326
01:34:21,848 --> 01:34:23,748
You know the game.

2327
01:34:24,382 --> 01:34:28,682
Hey, Tony.
Look, uh,

2328
01:34:28,686 --> 01:34:31,246
I need you
to help me now.

2329
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:32,285
Ok?

2330
01:34:32,289 --> 01:34:34,259
I want to, Mike.

2331
01:34:34,257 --> 01:34:36,317
I really do.

2332
01:34:36,325 --> 01:34:39,755
Besides killing
you myself...

2333
01:34:40,728 --> 01:34:43,958
I can't do nothing
for you, baby.

2334
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:48,933
You going
to kill me, man?

2335
01:34:48,934 --> 01:34:50,704
I don't know,
man.

2336
01:34:50,702 --> 01:34:52,802
You don't know?

2337
01:34:52,804 --> 01:34:53,974
You don't know?

2338
01:34:53,971 --> 01:34:54,901
Come on, man.

2339
01:34:54,905 --> 01:34:55,845
You just now said

2340
01:34:55,855 --> 01:34:56,795
you was going
to kill me.

2341
01:34:56,806 --> 01:34:58,066
Me--godfather
to your firstborn.

2342
01:34:58,073 --> 01:34:59,073
You remember me?

2343
01:34:59,074 --> 01:35:00,074
Too much crime,

2344
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:03,805
too much time
like this, yo.

2345
01:35:03,812 --> 01:35:05,142
Now you standing
there telling me

2346
01:35:05,146 --> 01:35:06,706
that all that shit
don't count?

2347
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:07,714
Like it don't
mean nothing?

2348
01:35:07,715 --> 01:35:08,805
Like, what,
all of a sudden

2349
01:35:08,816 --> 01:35:09,976
I'm--I'm--I'm
a fucking stranger?

2350
01:35:09,983 --> 01:35:11,253
I don't mean shit
to you no more?

2351
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:12,350
I can't believe
that, man.

2352
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,251
I mean, I know
a lot of shit

2353
01:35:14,252 --> 01:35:15,682
can happen
in 2 0r 3 years.

2354
01:35:15,686 --> 01:35:16,916
You know,
people change.

2355
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,540
But, Tony, yo,

2356
01:35:18,543 --> 01:35:20,173
what the fuck
happened to you?

2357
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:21,786
The fucking world
happened to me, Mike.

2358
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,361
I got a criminal
record, Mike.

2359
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:25,789
The world don't want
no parts of me.

2360
01:35:25,794 --> 01:35:27,064
It don't give
a fuck about me.

2361
01:35:27,061 --> 01:35:30,931
It don't owe me shit.
Not a goddamn thing.

2362
01:35:30,931 --> 01:35:33,871
So I did what
I had to do, Mike.

2363
01:35:33,867 --> 01:35:36,097
Now I don't owe
nobody nothing.

2364
01:35:36,102 --> 01:35:37,972
Yeah, nobody
but Manny.

2365
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:39,550
You owe him.

2366
01:35:39,554 --> 01:35:41,144
The motherfucker
owns you.

2367
01:35:41,139 --> 01:35:42,809
No, motherfucker.
Oh?

2368
01:35:42,807 --> 01:35:44,287
You own me.

2369
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:45,771
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about the dope, man.

2370
01:35:45,776 --> 01:35:47,006
I didn't know it
was yours, you know?

2371
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:48,380
Talk to Manny.
Maybe--

2372
01:35:48,378 --> 01:35:49,728
Manny ain't
interested

2373
01:35:49,728 --> 01:35:51,078
in no conversations
about nothing.

2374
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,710
Take a look
out the window, Mike.

2375
01:35:53,715 --> 01:35:55,715
Go ahead. Take a look
out the window.

2376
01:35:55,717 --> 01:35:57,777
This ain't no
flimflam.

2377
01:35:57,785 --> 01:35:59,475
This ain't no
riker's fucking island.

2378
01:35:59,486 --> 01:36:00,746
This is the life,
Mike.

2379
01:36:00,753 --> 01:36:02,393
What do you think
they're going to do

2380
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:03,487
to me when I don't
come through?

2381
01:36:03,488 --> 01:36:05,188
What do you think
they're going to do

2382
01:36:05,189 --> 01:36:07,289
to Maxine,
my little girl?

2383
01:36:07,291 --> 01:36:09,121
They got Max?

2384
01:36:09,126 --> 01:36:10,726
They got precious?

2385
01:36:10,727 --> 01:36:11,787
I'm sorry,
Tony, man.

2386
01:36:11,794 --> 01:36:12,864
I didn't mean to put
you in no shit.

2387
01:36:12,862 --> 01:36:15,402
You are so fucking
full of shit, Mike.

2388
01:36:15,397 --> 01:36:17,097
I just thought
that I could--

2389
01:36:17,098 --> 01:36:18,228
you thought?

2390
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:19,462
You thought what?

2391
01:36:19,466 --> 01:36:21,166
That you
could be Manny?

2392
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,797
That you could
trust nine lives?

2393
01:36:23,802 --> 01:36:25,102
You see, that's
your problem

2394
01:36:25,103 --> 01:36:27,103
right there,
Mike.

2395
01:36:27,104 --> 01:36:29,104
You don't think.
You never fucking did.

2396
01:36:29,107 --> 01:36:30,737
20/20 Mike.

2397
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:31,871
You walk
around like

2398
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:34,175
a fucking
blind man, man.

2399
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:38,749
I ain't ready
to die today, Tony.

2400
01:36:38,748 --> 01:36:42,048
Brother, I ain't ready
to die for you.

2401
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:43,481
Ok.

2402
01:36:43,485 --> 01:36:46,515
Ok, I'll make a deal
with you then.

2403
01:36:46,521 --> 01:36:48,051
Fuck a deal.

2404
01:36:48,055 --> 01:36:49,345
Come on, man.

2405
01:36:49,356 --> 01:36:50,856
Look, I'm going
to go downstairs

2406
01:36:50,857 --> 01:36:51,937
like you said.
I just--

2407
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:53,020
ok, I'm going to go
downstairs. I'm--

2408
01:36:53,025 --> 01:36:54,115
shut the fuck up,
Mike.

2409
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:55,126
I ain't trying
to hear you.

2410
01:36:55,127 --> 01:36:56,957
I need you to stall
them for me.

2411
01:36:56,962 --> 01:36:58,762
I ain't trying
to hear you, Mike.

2412
01:36:58,763 --> 01:36:59,503
Listen to me.

2413
01:36:59,497 --> 01:37:00,827
I'm going
to go downstairs

2414
01:37:00,831 --> 01:37:02,161
like you said, but
I'm going to try--

2415
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:03,266
fuck that, Mike.

2416
01:37:03,266 --> 01:37:04,366
Get your fucking
ass in here.

2417
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:05,466
I'm going to try
and make it. I just--

2418
01:37:05,469 --> 01:37:06,939
I'm going to make it.
I'm going to--

2419
01:37:06,937 --> 01:37:08,067
get that fucking
hand down.

2420
01:37:08,071 --> 01:37:09,371
Tony, I'm begging you.

2421
01:37:09,372 --> 01:37:10,872
[Speaking spanish]

2422
01:37:10,873 --> 01:37:12,373
I'm begging you, man.
Please don't kill me, all right?

2423
01:37:12,374 --> 01:37:13,874
Tony, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please.

2424
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:14,976
Please don't
kill me, Tony.

2425
01:37:14,977 --> 01:37:17,207
Tony. Tony,
don't kill me.

2426
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:19,452
<i> No me mates,</i> man.
<i> No me mates.</i>

2427
01:37:19,448 --> 01:37:20,408
Tony.

2428
01:37:20,415 --> 01:37:22,845
Get up.

2429
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,920
Huh?

2430
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:26,547
Get the fuck
up, Mike.

2431
01:37:30,956 --> 01:37:33,256
I don't even know
why I'm doing this,

2432
01:37:33,258 --> 01:37:34,088
but...

2433
01:37:34,092 --> 01:37:35,562
Because I'm your boy.

2434
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,060
Too much crime,

2435
01:37:37,061 --> 01:37:38,491
too much time.
Too much time.

2436
01:37:38,495 --> 01:37:40,085
Mike...

2437
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:40,986
What the fuck

2438
01:37:40,996 --> 01:37:42,796
am I going
to say to Manny?

2439
01:37:42,797 --> 01:37:43,947
Hey, hey.
Come on. Come on.

2440
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:45,097
Come on, Tony.
You'll think of something.

2441
01:37:45,099 --> 01:37:46,529
You'll think
of something, man.

2442
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:47,683
You're smart.

2443
01:37:47,683 --> 01:37:48,833
Are we going
to do this? Mm-hmm?

2444
01:37:48,835 --> 01:37:50,565
We're going to do
this right now, Mike.

2445
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,570
Ok. Ok.
Do-or-die time, right?

2446
01:37:52,572 --> 01:37:53,902
Right.
Ok.

2447
01:37:53,906 --> 01:37:55,906
Do-or-die time.

2448
01:37:56,508 --> 01:37:57,938
In all these years
