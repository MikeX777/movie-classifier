1
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,756
Vicky? It's your father...

2
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,698
Oh, that damned English!

3
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,465
I'm at the airport.
I'm coming round to see you now.

4
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,050
You're Vicky's father!

5
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,256
I'm Christa,
Vicky's Hungarian friend.

6
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,695
Nice to meet you.

7
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,928
What's in there?
- Real Bavarian sausage.

8
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,973
I smuggled it through customs.
Vicky loves it.

9
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,301
I have to put it in the fridge at once.

10
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,139
At my sister's place.
We live nearby.

11
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,818
But where is Vicky?
- She's at work.

12
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,478
Doing a matinee?

13
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,387
Something like that.

14
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,730
It's <i>so</i> clean here.
You can eat off the floor.

15
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,212
I bet you can't get
such good sausage here.

16
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,786
What is that?

17
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,768
It's a beautiful apartment.

18
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,404
Surely you don't want to live
with your sister for ever?

19
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,748
I was engaged to a German. Fritz.

20
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:08,977
And then?

21
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,213
Well, one day...

22
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,247
On 2O April...

23
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:20,363
...he came to the door of his house
wearing a uniform...

24
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,796
...the <i>Horst</i> Wessel song
in the background.

25
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:28,061
His mother had made potato salad...

26
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,767
...with a swastika of mayonnaise on top.

27
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,779
Then they served celery cutlets.

28
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,051
The F?hrer was a vegetarian.

29
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,436
Vicky? It's your father...

30
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,739
Oh, that damned English!

31
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,778
I'm at the airport.
I'm coming round to see you now.

32
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,028
Connoisseurs don't drink
American beer.

33
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,365
They prefer Japanese, Mexican...

34
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,998
...or German beer.

35
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,839
Can you drink the water here?

36
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,815
I can tell you a strange story.

37
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,417
I know this German woman...

38
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,916
...who was ashamed
of her small breasts.

39
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:04,855
After a year in New York,
when she drank lots of water...

40
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,990
...her breasts started to grow.

41
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,446
I should go now.

42
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,323
This...

43
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,961
...is my little man.

44
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,834
His name is Fritzi.

45
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,132
You look terrible.

46
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,205
Would you like tea?
- Please.

47
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,401
Your house looks worse
than I thought.

48
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,279
What does your husband say?

49
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,437
Dad, do me a favour.

50
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,012
Don't criticise my way of life.

51
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,286
I have a gift for you.

52
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,066
They are very efficient.

53
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,137
German technology.

54
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,775
Just try it.

55
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,912
Impossible. The electricity
is different here.

56
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,446
No problem.

57
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,351
Just press this button.

58
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,151
Watch.

59
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,168
Who is that?

60
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,136
My husband.

61
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,767
I could eat a horse.
Let's have a meal.

62
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,954
Knishes...

63
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,254
What are "knishes", Vicky?

64
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,729
I want you to speak German to me.

65
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,643
Come on. Lots of Russian Jews
live here and they hate Germans.

66
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,678
We won't get served here.

67
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,365
American women seem <i>so</i> independent.

68
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,397
Don't they need men any more?

69
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,316
Are you having problems with Ben?

70
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,853
What makes you think that?

71
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,048
I don't understand you.
You are never together.

72
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,860
Ben organises parties and I often
have to go to rehearsals.

73
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,200
You leave me alone every day.
Tomorrow we'll spend the day together.

74
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,771
Impossible.
I have an audition.

75
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,639
Then I'll come too.
- Really, Dad.

76
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,939
Don't argue.

77
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,684
This isn't for us.

78
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,822
I have to pay the rent.
- But not with sex.

79
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,230
Let go of me.

80
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,436
I'll wait outside.

81
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,894
Vicky, you'll be surprised...

82
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:48,197
...but you're father's been
offered a great job.

83
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,440
Where were you?

84
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,972
I'll be in an
American commercial.

85
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:00,683
Are you joking?
- Aren't you happy for me?

86
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,952
I'll tell you later.

87
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,226
I have to hurry to the agency.

88
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,830
See you later.

89
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,444
What was it like?
- Great.

90
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,679
She was fantastic.

91
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,048
Does it sound real?

92
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,126
Ay Caramba! There's only one arm-bah!

93
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,896
Me in an American commercial.

94
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:48,471
What will they say in Germany?

95
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,414
Tofu again!

96
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:08,026
No food in the house.

97
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,309
Then he slammed
the door behind him.

98
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:32,310
I haven't seen him since.

99
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,273
He didn't ring either.

100
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,791
Come on!

101
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,725
I may lose my job.

102
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,702
No, because I am always late.

103
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,299
Look, your father!

104
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,304
Very professional.

105
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:36,635
If only I knew where he was.

106
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,890
I'm Hans M)hring.
You're not bleeding.

107
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:23,342
Does that mean "pain"?

108
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:37,714
I thought about it...

109
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,960
What's it like as two women...?

110
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,400
What do you think?

111
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:52,798
You don't need to explain.
I understand.

112
01:08:56,833 --> 01:09:02,715
I didn't tell the truth.
Ben and I aren't married.

113
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:09,981
I never thought that you and Ben...

114
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:37,645
My daughter is a local celebrity.

115
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,878
I'm no celebrity.

116
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,695
Just look.

117
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,734
It's for you.

118
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:05,268
Where did you get that money?
- From the agency.

119
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:09,313
At first I thought it was a lot of cash...

120
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:12,749
...but then I read the contract
and concluded...

121
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,287
...that the crooks had ripped me off.

122
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:26,834
Up America!

123
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:49,116
You really won't come back
to Germany with me?

124
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:54,918
How can you manage now
Ben has moved out?

125
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,657
Don't you worry,
I like my own company.
