1
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,653
Asomidin Tohirov?

2
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:31,903
I did it yesterday.

3
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,445
It's my third time.

4
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,445
Want me to go?

5
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:40,820
No, I will.
You can sleep.

6
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,278
Yum... here.

7
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:56,362
- Hot?
- No, it's not.

8
00:01:58,237 --> 00:01:59,862
I said you could sleep.

9
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,195
I couldn't.

10
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,820
You okay, Leo?

11
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:04,070
Too hot?

12
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:05,153
Yes.

13
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:08,487
This way I see you.

14
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,487
We don't see much of Mommy
these days.

15
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:22,903
We meet at my mom's or here?

16
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,028
It's tonight?

17
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:28,737
Virginie, you're a fucking pain.

18
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,278
Is your partner coming along?

19
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:55,737
No.

20
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,153
Do you have anyone
to accompany you?

21
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:02,320
No.

22
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,820
Tonight, antibiotics

23
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,903
to prevent infection
during the procedure.

24
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:53,987
Have a good day.

25
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:55,070
Thanks.

26
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,195
What's your problem?

27
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:10,362
You do things offhandedly.

28
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:13,070
- You're imprecise, careless.
- And on the ground?

29
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:14,237
Am I a good cop?

30
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:17,153
Answer me.
Am I good on the ground?

31
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,987
Yeah.

32
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,112
So? Why are you railing?

33
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:21,945
I'm not Oxford Unabridged!

34
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,987
I'm a cop.
I'm not here to write a novel.

35
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,612
All good, Miss Norway?

36
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,153
What's wrong?

37
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:40,570
Virginie?

38
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,653
Are you free?

39
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:44,862
Yeah, why?

40
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,737
To get this woman's belongings.
Violent husband.

41
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:51,487
He's not in.
Can you come along?

42
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:12,362
It'll be fine, ma'am.

43
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:16,445
We're here.

44
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:28,278
- What the fuck?
- Step back.

45
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:29,445
Step back.

46
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,237
Sonia, come on...

47
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:32,487
Sir, over there.

48
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,320
- I can't talk to her?
- No.

49
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,278
Back up and stay put.

50
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:46,862
Bitch.

51
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,320
Little whore.

52
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:57,862
Go wash, dirty whore.

53
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:00,237
Feel better now?

54
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,028
You're cumming, right?

55
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:04,945
Your uniform gets you off.

56
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,237
Stop pretending you have balls.

57
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,862
I've had enough now.

58
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,695
Let go! Let go, I said!

59
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:17,278
Will you let go?

60
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,778
Bitch!

61
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,737
Miss Norway!

62
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:42,862
Aristide, stop calling me that.

63
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,653
What?
Would you prefer Miss Senegal?

64
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:48,778
I have an important question.

65
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:50,612
Primordial.

66
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,195
What do we do for lunch?

67
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:56,737
Kebab or kebab?

68
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,820
Be happy.
I'm leaving you the choice.

69
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,737
I can't. I have work.

70
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:03,362
Cheating on me?

71
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:06,028
Eating with another man?

72
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:10,778
Okay, then.

73
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,362
<i>Backup requested by the riverbank.</i>

74
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,987
<i>36 Quai d'Austerlitz.</i>

75
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,070
<i>Do you copy?</i>

76
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:41,862
Cool.

77
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:43,862
Time to kick some ass.

78
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:45,320
Sounds likely.

79
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,570
Good sex last night.

80
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:49,653
And a good fight today.

81
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,320
You gonna help?

82
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:38,320
Don't move!

83
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,778
Nice workout!

84
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,070
What happened?
Rip your pantyhose?

85
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,403
I haven't slept in 18 months.

86
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,487
So?

87
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,612
That's women for you.

88
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:00,695
You want equality

89
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:04,320
then you play the mother card
or the period card.

90
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:05,570
Seriously.

91
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,195
- Leave your ovaries at home.
- Lay off!

92
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,778
Not today, not you.

93
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:11,987
Why "not me"?

94
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,070
- What did I do?
- You did nothing.

95
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:17,153
So what is it?

96
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:20,153
I'm getting an abortion.

97
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,237
I couldn't leave my ovaries at home.
Sorry.

98
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:29,987
It's not your fault.
I forgot my pill, one fucking time.

99
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,112
Here we are.

100
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:34,153
You sure it's mine?

101
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,153
I'm sure all right.

102
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:39,945
I'll spare you the details.
100% sure.

103
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,945
<i>- It won't work!</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

104
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:07,320
<i>You can't have</i>
<i>more than one girl in a car.</i>

105
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,737
<i>I know.</i>

106
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:11,237
It's the rule
but rules change.

107
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,487
Two girls can't patrol without a man.

108
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,278
Am I not right?

109
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:20,403
It's the rule!

110
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:25,820
- How do you make a cop?
- Tell us.

111
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,320
One man minimum.

112
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,612
Takes more than a woman alone.

113
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:34,112
- And two women?
- Not even two women!

114
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,195
You're unbelievable!

115
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:38,737
Machos like you still exist?

116
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:41,445
It's the truth.
One man minimum!

117
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,362
I need two officers to volunteer.

118
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,278
It's not our sector

119
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:24,237
and it means doing overtime.

120
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:27,570
The prison fire
has Escort Crew scrambling.

121
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:28,820
Gregoire?

122
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,487
No, sorry.

123
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,528
Aristide?

124
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,278
No way.

125
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,987
I have a life, unlike others.

126
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:43,362
Erik? Up for it?

127
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,653
Okay, but they have some nerve.

128
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,862
I'll do it. I'll go along.

129
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:51,903
I had nothing to do with it.

130
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:53,987
No, it doesn't suit me.

131
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:57,570
I told you I wasn't sure.

132
00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:00,070
An emergency is an emergency!

133
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:02,487
Hello?

134
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:47,903
- You okay?
- Fine.

135
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,737
I need to search the car.

136
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:51,403
You never know.

137
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,737
See?

138
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:03,195
This can become a weapon.

139
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,612
Anything can.

140
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,403
What's Herve doing?

141
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,112
<i>Where did you put them?</i>

142
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:39,945
Not in there.

143
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,903
You're a pain, Martine.

144
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,487
You're a pain in the ass, you know.

145
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,403
Can't you stop busting my balls?

146
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:50,653
Freezing.

147
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,528
No, cold.

148
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:02,695
Don't come crying
when you get cancer.

149
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:05,737
Don't count on me
to take you for chemo.

150
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:08,362
Why are you always so nasty?

151
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,528
Why take it out on me?

152
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:14,487
If we'd had a kid,
I'd take it out on him.

153
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,237
But it's all muscle, no balls.

154
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:35,737
I grab the guy and say:

155
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:37,153
"I'll whip your ass

156
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,945
next time you call me 'bro'..."

157
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,028
<i>You upset?</i>

158
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:40,945
His bro?

159
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,695
From what mother?

160
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:44,862
Can you take it down?

161
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,403
You're not happy?

162
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,070
No, I'm not!

163
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,695
You know why?

164
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:53,070
Your robbery report is full of mistakes.

165
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:56,653
Stop nitpicking. They're just typos.

166
00:14:57,445 --> 00:15:00,820
Want me to write my reports
in sonnet form?

167
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:02,653
Enough already.

168
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
What's your problem?

169
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,362
You do everything offhandedly.

170
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:09,320
You're imprecise, careless.

171
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:11,278
And on the ground?

172
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,487
Am I a good cop?

173
00:15:15,237 --> 00:15:17,112
Answer me.
On the ground?

174
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,153
Am I a good cop?

175
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,487
Yeah.

176
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,987
So why are you railing?
I'm not Oxford Unabridged.

177
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:30,112
I'm a cop.
I'm not here to write a novel.

178
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:34,653
Take her to her place.
All her stuff is there.

179
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,028
All right, I'll deal with it.

180
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:40,070
Virginie...

181
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,028
Are you free?

182
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:43,528
Yeah, why?

183
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,528
To get this woman's belongings.

184
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,070
Violent husband.

185
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,487
He's not in.
Can you come along?

186
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:52,612
Look.

187
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:54,987
Broken, as usual.
Pain in the ass.

188
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:58,945
How can we work in a clunker like this?

189
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,737
Sometimes even the automatic locks
don't work.

190
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:08,987
They want more arrests
for their statistics

191
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:11,903
but the guys can open the doors and run.

192
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,445
It's wild.

193
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,237
- Step back.
- What the fuck?

194
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:20,320
Step back.

195
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,028
Sonia, come on.

196
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:23,320
Sir, over there.

197
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,195
- I can't talk to her?
- No.

198
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,195
Step back and stay put, you hear?

199
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:43,945
He's not a bastard, you know.

200
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:46,612
Excuse me?

201
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:51,487
He's not mean.
He didn't do it on purpose.

202
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,945
It's my fault too.

203
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,153
It'll be fine, ma'am.

204
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:07,737
A man who hits a woman is no man.

205
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,862
There's no justifying that, ever.

206
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,028
Let go! Let go, I said!

207
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:17,528
Stay here.

208
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,778
Calm down! You hear me?

209
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,612
Yeah, I hear you.

210
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,112
What are you doing to him?

211
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,070
Stop, you're hurting him.

212
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,237
It'll be fine.

213
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,695
You're hurting him.

214
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:40,945
Leave.

215
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,528
Please...

216
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,612
leave.

217
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:12,320
It's good.

218
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:14,403
Take it away.

219
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,445
I need a place like that.

220
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,653
Change scenery, take a breather.

221
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:07,487
<i>Everywhere in the streets</i>
<i>I want them to talk about me</i>

222
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:11,403
<i>I want the girls to be naked</i>
<i>and to jump on me</i>

223
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,153
<i>To admire me and to kill me</i>

224
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,987
<i>To strip away my virtue</i>

225
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:22,945
<i>For the former schoolgirls</i>
<i>I'll be an idol</i>

226
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:26,778
<i>And every night,</i>
<i>out of breath in their beds</i>

227
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:30,487
<i>they'll cheat on their husbands</i>

228
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,695
I just wanted to punish him.

229
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,778
I love my son!

230
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:43,070
I wanted to teach him a lesson,
so he'd cool off.

231
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:44,903
I'm not a bad mom.

232
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:46,362
I didn't want to kill him.

233
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:02,862
Despite the soap, it lingers.

234
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:06,778
The smell of death.
Ever notice? It sticks.

235
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,903
When I go home,
I stay on the landing.

236
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:15,737
Till the light goes out.

237
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:18,487
I undress and count to 60.

238
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:22,070
So I don't take the shit inside.

239
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,362
I leave it in the hallway.

240
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:26,570
It's stupid.

241
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,570
For me, it's underwear.

242
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:39,570
I always make sure
my underwear isn't too ugly.

243
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:42,445
To be presentable, just in case.

244
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:45,362
If I end up on a slab at the morgue.

245
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,612
It's stupid too.

246
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,987
<i>So Granny, what's this all about?</i>

247
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:05,487
Trying to get attention?

248
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,028
Take care of yourself.

249
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:09,278
Okay?

250
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,528
And go easy on the nurses,
I know you.

251
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:16,320
I'm coming for Christmas.

252
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,862
So wait for me.

253
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,862
You promise?

254
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:30,070
There you go.

255
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:33,612
Love you.

256
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,612
Something between you two?

257
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:18,987
Yeah, right.

258
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:27,528
All good, Miss Norway?

259
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:30,903
What's wrong?

260
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,320
Didn't get your bonus?

261
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:48,445
- Miss Norway...
- Aristide, stop calling me that.

262
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:51,362
- Kebab or kebab?
- I can't. I have work.

263
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:53,570
Cheating on me?

264
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,320
Eating with another man?

265
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,112
Okay, then.

266
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,778
Hello, chef!

267
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:10,903
Hello.

268
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,487
Today I'm on a diet.

269
00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:16,278
Kebab, no meat, no bread.
Just lettuce and tomato.

270
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,695
The usual?

271
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,445
Just kidding. The usual.

272
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:21,237
Everything but onions.

273
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,278
No onions.

274
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,612
- For here or to go?
- For here.

275
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,820
All right.

276
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:39,445
I love my son.

277
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:42,987
I wanted to teach him a lesson,
so he'd cool off.

278
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:44,820
I'm not a bad mom!

279
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:48,945
- I didn't want to kill him...
- Shut up.

280
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:54,737
Stop now.

281
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,903
<i>Backup requested by the riverbank.</i>

282
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,070
<i>What's wrong?</i>

283
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:20,695
<i>Nothing.</i>

284
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:26,362
Cool.

285
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:28,903
Time to kick some ass.

286
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:33,278
I mean it.

287
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:35,612
Leave your ovaries at home.

288
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:37,570
Lay off.

289
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,987
Not today, and not you.

290
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:41,445
Why "not me"?

291
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:44,320
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

292
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:46,612
So what is it?

293
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,403
I'm getting an abortion.

294
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,487
I couldn't leave my ovaries at home.
Sorry.

295
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:56,862
It's not your fault.

296
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,903
I forgot my pill.
One fucking time, here we are.

297
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:07,028
You sure it's mine?

298
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:09,278
Yeah, I'm sure.

299
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:11,778
I'll spare you the details.
100% sure.

300
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:39,237
Why did you become a cop?

301
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:44,028
Don't say you dreamt of it as a kid.

302
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:46,737
I wanted to figure skate.

303
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:49,445
Really?

304
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,487
How did you go from skates to guns?

305
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:55,987
I don't know. It just happened.

306
00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:57,945
Let me guess.

307
00:25:58,278 --> 00:25:59,070
Dad a cop?

308
00:25:59,237 --> 00:26:00,195
Nope.

309
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:02,695
- Grandfather a cop?
- Not even.

310
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,487
How about you?

311
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,028
Well, me...

312
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,195
My choice was dealer or junkie.
Like my brothers.

313
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,695
What can I say?

314
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:16,487
I went astray.

315
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:20,987
You believed me?

316
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,653
It's not true?

317
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,153
- You believed me?
- Yeah.

318
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,237
Nope.

319
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:27,237
Why not?
How would I know?

320
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:29,612
- You're so prejudiced.
- Nonsense.

321
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:30,737
You are.

322
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,362
It could have been true.

323
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:36,570
I have no brothers.

324
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:37,653
All right.

325
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,195
Just a sister.

326
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:41,070
She's a judge.

327
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,820
Okay. Is that true?

328
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:44,070
No.

329
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:45,778
- It isn't?
- Nope.

330
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:48,862
She's a speech therapist.

331
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:50,903
Which is still cool.

332
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:55,778
An ice skater.

333
00:26:58,403 --> 00:26:59,320
Yep.

334
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,278
I don't believe you.

335
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:05,945
When is your curfew?

336
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:09,570
Is your husband nice?

337
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,070
Yeah, he is.

338
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:12,612
He's cool.

339
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:13,528
And the kid?

340
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:15,820
How old is he now?

341
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,237
Young enough to count in months.

342
00:28:21,987 --> 00:28:23,237
How long you married?

343
00:28:23,695 --> 00:28:25,778
Is this an interrogation?

344
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,278
Can I keep my shoes and laces?

345
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,112
I'm just interested.

346
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:32,737
I'm not allowed?

347
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:36,612
Seven years.

348
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:38,903
Wow, not bad.

349
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,945
I never went beyond seven days.

350
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,487
Bravo.

351
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,195
That's the way I am.

352
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,570
I can't be tamed.

353
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,653
No one's trying to tame you.

354
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:55,445
You mustn't worry.

355
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,028
Really?

356
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,987
Not even a little?

357
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,028
You're being an idiot.

358
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:08,987
And I have to tell you.

359
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:10,070
What?

360
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:12,903
You skate well.

361
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,153
All right.

362
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:20,362
I have to go.

363
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:23,070
Goodnight.

364
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,153
I need two officers to volunteer.
It's urgent.

365
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:00,487
Aristide?

366
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,112
No way.

367
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:04,570
I have a life, unlike others.

368
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,653
Erik? Up for it?

369
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:11,403
Yeah, but they have some nerve.

370
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,320
The fire isn't their fault.

371
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:15,487
I'll do it.

372
00:30:15,862 --> 00:30:18,362
I have no plans.

373
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,278
We'll meet you at the car.

374
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:25,612
Still, I don't like it.

375
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:28,153
Escorting a prisoner isn't hard.

376
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I don't like it.

377
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:32,445
Neither do I.
I'd rather be with my wife.

378
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:34,112
Herve!

379
00:30:35,195 --> 00:30:37,112
I was kidding. I can go.

380
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,737
No one's expecting me.

381
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,695
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

382
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:43,570
All right then.

383
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,320
Asomidin Tohirov?

384
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:07,070
We're sending you to your country.

385
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:15,903
Understand?

386
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,237
Sit down.

387
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,362
Give that to me.

388
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:15,320
What is this?

389
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,570
You meant to swallow it?

390
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,112
What are you doing here?

391
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:16,612
So?

392
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,403
Ready to kick out a foreigner?

393
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:22,028
Why do you say that?

394
00:33:22,403 --> 00:33:24,153
It's what we're doing.

395
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:26,903
You hadn't understood?

396
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:29,153
Erik, is this true?

397
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,237
Yes, because of the fire.

398
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:34,653
A guy needs to be at the airport.
We're driving him.

399
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,403
It's not our job.
Why do we have to?

400
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,195
Not our job? Why did you offer?

401
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:41,862
You're funny.

402
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:46,278
I told you, Escort Crew is busy
transporting detainees.

403
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:48,070
I didn't know.

404
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:49,778
You volunteered.

405
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,278
I couldn't guess.

406
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:55,028
You just didn't want to go home.

407
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:14,570
Where's an all-night drugstore?

408
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:17,112
What's wrong now?

409
00:34:17,653 --> 00:34:20,403
I need to make a quick stop.
Can we?

410
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:22,570
Can't wait till tomorrow?

411
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:25,070
No. I needed to go after my shift.

412
00:34:25,403 --> 00:34:27,820
I don't know where there is one.

413
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:30,320
There's one at Nation.

414
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,695
We have time to make a detour.
Quickly.

415
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:10,570
Anything else?

416
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,903
A glass of water.

417
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:18,945
Prefab units are fire hazards.

418
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:21,528
They cram them in
and they're surprised.

419
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:14,945
<i>That's the way it is</i>

420
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,820
<i>So damn pretty,</i>
<i>when she goes out</i>

421
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:27,028
<i>So damn pretty,</i>
<i>I love her so damn much</i>

422
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:32,570
<i>She has eyes like a gun</i>

423
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:35,653
<i>She has a killer gaze</i>

424
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,528
<i>She's pulled the trigger first</i>

425
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,695
<i>She hit me, I'm dying...</i>

426
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:52,570
You're such a cock-block.

427
00:38:54,945 --> 00:38:57,278
You two are so depressing.

428
00:38:57,695 --> 00:38:59,778
It's like being in a hearse.

429
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,237
I won a song contest as a kid.

430
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:14,112
I had a voice, I swear...
clear as crystal.

431
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:15,987
Angelic.

432
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:19,528
My grandma thought I'd be
the next Michael Jackson.

433
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:23,445
But no... my voice changed.

434
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,528
Who cares about your life?

435
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:28,653
We don't give a shit.

436
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:31,112
You're pissing us off.

437
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:01,862
The reception office?

438
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:03,445
Down on the left.

439
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,570
I'm here to take the detainee
to the airport.

440
00:41:02,612 --> 00:41:03,987
Follow me.

441
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,695
How did the fire start?

442
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:08,362
With a mattress.

443
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:11,445
They have lots of imagination.
Lots.

444
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:16,612
Some slice open their bellies,
others start fires.

445
00:41:17,362 --> 00:41:18,945
Each one has his thing.

446
00:41:20,737 --> 00:41:22,153
We have nothing here.

447
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,903
No equipment.

448
00:41:24,403 --> 00:41:26,362
Not even an emergency exit.

449
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,320
We had to cut the bars

450
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,403
or they'd all have sizzled.

451
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:43,820
Guy in the orange sweater.

452
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:45,237
A Tadjik.

453
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:47,778
He has his belongings.

454
00:41:48,487 --> 00:41:50,487
- Was he frisked?
- He's clean.

455
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:53,612
He had a blade on him, so watch out.

456
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:16,195
For the Deportation Unit at Roissy.

457
00:43:19,237 --> 00:43:20,862
Know where you're going?

458
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:23,695
Understands nothing.

459
00:43:24,278 --> 00:43:26,362
We're taking you to the airport.

460
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:31,153
You have a layover in Istanbul.
Then back to Tajikistan.

461
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,528
Any objections?

462
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,862
No?

463
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,778
I'll handcuff you for the ride.

464
00:44:37,112 --> 00:44:38,362
Tohirov?

465
00:44:38,987 --> 00:44:41,278
You're not going to the airport?

466
00:44:41,737 --> 00:44:44,862
We appealed to the European Court
for Human Rights.

467
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:46,278
They're ruling soon.

468
00:44:46,445 --> 00:44:47,612
I know nothing about it.

469
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:49,737
They'll kill him back home.

470
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:50,987
It's not my call.

471
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:53,403
You may as well let him burn.

472
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:54,820
Less hypocritical!

473
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,653
Noble profession! Bravo!

474
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:02,320
So?

475
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:03,737
It's all good.

476
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:05,320
I was looking for you.

477
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:06,487
I'm here.

478
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:31,653
We saved you from the flames.

479
00:45:33,153 --> 00:45:35,362
- Say thanks.
- No French.

480
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:37,570
TN12, individual in custody.

481
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:38,487
<i>Copy that.</i>

482
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:05,987
He's not too calm?

483
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:09,028
Keep an eye on him...

484
00:46:11,612 --> 00:46:12,737
Yeah.

485
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:30,570
Erik...

486
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,945
Why did you open it?

487
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,528
What are you, a cop?

488
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:39,987
Is your name on it?

489
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:41,737
No? So don't open.

490
00:47:41,903 --> 00:47:43,528
It was half open.

491
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,945
Mail theft.

492
00:47:57,528 --> 00:47:59,195
Something political?

493
00:47:59,903 --> 00:48:01,362
I don't know...

494
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:05,820
Understand what you read?

495
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:10,028
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

496
00:48:11,445 --> 00:48:12,695
And so?

497
00:48:12,987 --> 00:48:14,112
Just words.

498
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:16,612
Excuse me.
"Men in masks led me

499
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,195
to an isolation cell,

500
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:21,653
a dungeon.
I was tortured for days.

501
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,112
Very violent.
Groups of 3 or 4, at all hours.

502
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:28,903
They beat me nonstop.
Fists, feet, clubs.

503
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,112
A torturer asked if I wanted a smoke.

504
00:48:32,445 --> 00:48:33,320
I said yes.

505
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:34,737
He lit a cigarette

506
00:48:34,903 --> 00:48:37,862
and put a gas mask on me,
so I'd suffocate.

507
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,737
Then they put wires around my wrists

508
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:46,612
and electrocuted me.
I fainted.

509
00:48:46,945 --> 00:48:49,820
It lasted ten days.
I thought I'd die."

510
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,112
Just words?

511
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:55,903
A story like that costs 15 euros.

512
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:59,487
There are tons of details.
He can't have invented it.

513
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,612
What do you want us to do?

514
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:07,403
Envelopes are sealed for a reason.

515
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:14,612
They're going to kill him.

516
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:16,195
A real sob story.

517
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:17,278
Yeah.

518
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,653
They exaggerate the threat
to get refugee status.

519
00:49:22,903 --> 00:49:24,987
They lie. Embroider.

520
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:27,487
Why issue an order to deport

521
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:30,278
if he'd be killed upon arrival?

522
00:49:30,445 --> 00:49:31,737
Think it over.

523
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:41,612
Enough.
We're not here to chitchat.

524
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,820
We're cops, not social workers.

525
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:46,028
You never loosen up.

526
00:51:32,903 --> 00:51:33,778
What the hell?

527
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:36,445
It's okay. He's fine.

528
00:51:36,987 --> 00:51:38,987
What's got into you?
Cuff him.

529
00:51:41,403 --> 00:51:42,278
Go on, breathe.

530
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,278
What's your problem today?

531
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:48,570
Is he a friend of yours?
Got family in Tajikistan?

532
00:51:49,903 --> 00:51:52,278
He's a shrimp.
Why are you scared?

533
00:51:52,445 --> 00:51:54,820
You're a pain! A real pain!

534
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,612
Isn't she?

535
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,112
Yes. She's a pain.

536
00:52:09,237 --> 00:52:11,112
<i>I'm working, dammit!!!</i>

537
00:53:48,528 --> 00:53:50,362
Why not the flashing lights?

538
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,570
Yeah, run red lights,
take roundabouts counter-clockwise.

539
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:05,362
Want the engine on our laps?

540
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:08,153
I said we have time.
What's your problem?

541
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,945
<i>Your mother?</i>

542
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:24,362
<i>No, my grandmother.</i>

543
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,445
She raised me.

544
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:28,237
One hell of a woman.

545
00:54:28,403 --> 00:54:29,820
What about your parents?

546
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,445
What about them?

547
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:33,820
What did they do?

548
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:35,862
Where are they from?

549
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:41,112
Do I ask you questions?

550
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,862
I can't know?

551
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:47,070
They were in France.

552
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:49,112
I came afterwards.

553
00:54:49,278 --> 00:54:50,903
How old were you?

554
00:55:01,153 --> 00:55:03,070
Do we have to share our lives?

555
00:55:05,112 --> 00:55:06,028
Yes?

556
00:55:06,445 --> 00:55:07,278
No.

557
00:55:11,528 --> 00:55:14,028
We'll have to stop meeting up.

558
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:16,070
I know.

559
00:55:16,237 --> 00:55:18,862
I don't know, like this anyway...

560
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,945
- I'm trying, I swear.
- Okay.

561
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,570
Trying very hard.

562
00:55:24,737 --> 00:55:26,028
I keep saying it.

563
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:28,362
I'm also trying hard.

564
00:55:28,903 --> 00:55:30,570
I keep saying to myself:

565
00:55:30,945 --> 00:55:33,528
"Miss Norway isn't for you.

566
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,487
She's not for you.

567
00:55:37,528 --> 00:55:38,862
She's married."

568
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,737
So I try to imagine you old, wrinkled.

569
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:46,195
Ugly as sin, no teeth.

570
00:55:46,653 --> 00:55:49,153
So you'll disgust me forever.

571
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,778
So I can move on.
But then you laugh...

572
00:55:52,028 --> 00:55:53,528
What can I do?

573
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:57,070
My heart melts like snow in the sun.

574
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,945
A poet. You kept that hidden.

575
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,778
What do I do now?

576
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:04,862
Figure it out.

577
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,862
It's a lost cause.

578
00:56:13,778 --> 00:56:15,112
Why are you exiting?

579
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:17,362
I'm hungry.

580
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:35,320
Coming?

581
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:38,862
Hurry up.

582
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:10,903
Keep it up
and Erik's going to lose it.

583
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,320
What are you after?

584
00:57:14,695 --> 00:57:16,403
Any chance the Tajik can run?

585
00:57:17,278 --> 00:57:18,278
No.

586
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,445
Would you let him run?

587
00:57:26,945 --> 00:57:28,487
I have no idea.

588
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:31,112
I don't care about him.

589
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:35,070
Think Mr. Clean would let you do it?

590
00:57:36,112 --> 00:57:37,153
But you...

591
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:40,278
would you let him run?

592
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:42,653
You're talking crap.

593
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,320
They're playing me for a fool.

594
00:57:49,528 --> 00:57:51,403
Don't try anything stupid.

595
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,945
I have my eyes on you.

596
00:57:58,862 --> 00:58:00,403
I'm no fool.

597
00:58:02,403 --> 00:58:04,112
You play the victim,

598
00:58:04,278 --> 00:58:06,945
but maybe you came
to blow up a market.

599
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,945
Who knows if you're an innocent lamb?

600
00:58:11,195 --> 00:58:14,028
Refugee or terrorist, how can we tell?

601
00:58:15,612 --> 00:58:17,153
No one is innocent

602
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,028
until proof of the contrary.

603
00:58:44,903 --> 00:58:48,195
3-course meal?
They're fucking in the crapper!

604
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:56,778
I don't understand what you said.

605
00:58:58,278 --> 00:58:59,653
I don't understand.

606
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,653
I understand nothing.

607
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:23,528
You're even prettier when you frown.

608
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,237
You're stupid.

609
00:59:27,403 --> 00:59:28,737
I wish.

610
00:59:29,028 --> 00:59:30,195
Wish what?

611
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:31,653
That I was stupid.

612
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,778
What you told me earlier...

613
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:43,362
about what you're doing...

614
00:59:47,195 --> 00:59:48,862
I keep thinking about it.

615
00:59:52,862 --> 00:59:54,195
It kills me.

616
00:59:56,987 --> 00:59:59,070
I can't get it out of my head.

617
01:00:05,153 --> 01:00:06,570
When are you going?

618
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,612
Tomorrow morning.

619
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,695
Is anyone accompanying you?

620
01:00:13,112 --> 01:00:14,028
Yes.

621
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,778
I'm going with a friend.

622
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:18,070
Good.

623
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,195
- Just don't go alone.
- Don't worry.

624
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,903
Corinne is coming along.

625
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,445
Corinne?

626
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,903
You better watch your guy.
He can up and go.

627
01:00:40,653 --> 01:00:41,737
No, no.

628
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:45,362
He's not hungry.
He'll eat in the plane.

629
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:47,070
Come on.

630
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,362
What are you doing?

631
01:01:12,028 --> 01:01:13,737
Think I don't understand?

632
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,445
You open the file, uncuff him,

633
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:21,778
stop for burgers,
stop at every light.

634
01:01:23,237 --> 01:01:26,862
We're asked to take him to Roissy,
we take him to Roissy.

635
01:01:27,737 --> 01:01:30,278
Police, airport, airplane.
Understand?

636
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:38,362
At least Escort Crew is competent.
Imagine the clusterfuck!

637
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,362
- Someone shit on your brains?
- Enough!

638
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:44,195
Stop bossing us around.

639
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,528
What do you think?

640
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,570
That your platitudes impress us?

641
01:02:01,445 --> 01:02:03,445
You'll make me gain weight.

642
01:02:06,778 --> 01:02:08,153
Find that funny?

643
01:03:34,737 --> 01:03:36,487
Pain in the fucking ass!

644
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:37,820
Pull over!

645
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:39,862
What do I do?

646
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:41,320
Take the exit.

647
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,945
And he's not cuffed, dammit!

648
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,362
Get up front.

649
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:28,528
I take the highway?

650
01:04:31,445 --> 01:04:33,153
Yes or no?

651
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:38,737
So?

652
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,445
Of course. Take the highway.

653
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,362
What else?

654
01:04:45,112 --> 01:04:47,320
Open the door and let him run?

655
01:04:47,945 --> 01:04:49,903
You think it's that easy?

656
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:51,528
Think so?

657
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:54,945
Sure, it's romantic,
but you think it's easy.

658
01:04:56,778 --> 01:04:59,153
They wouldn't send a chopper.

659
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:01,195
He's not a fugitive.

660
01:05:01,612 --> 01:05:03,028
Yeah, he's nothing.

661
01:05:03,528 --> 01:05:04,903
No one cares about him.

662
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,903
If he vanished,
no one would go looking.

663
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:13,487
He's just a poor guy, not a criminal.

664
01:05:14,903 --> 01:05:15,737
What do you know?

665
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:17,820
I know, that's all.

666
01:05:35,987 --> 01:05:37,653
And your panic attacks?

667
01:05:38,487 --> 01:05:39,612
Fine.

668
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,112
Still a tranquilizer a day?

669
01:05:43,945 --> 01:05:45,695
I'm down to a quarter.

670
01:05:45,862 --> 01:05:49,028
If it's not enough,
three quarters, or four.

671
01:05:51,987 --> 01:05:53,653
Meaning a whole pill.

672
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,153
Sometimes it comes back.

673
01:06:01,903 --> 01:06:03,362
Especially at night.

674
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:07,528
I tell myself
his death wasn't my fault.

675
01:06:09,778 --> 01:06:12,653
I couldn't know
the guy had a box-cutter.

676
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,362
Bad luck, that's all.

677
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:22,153
Bad luck?

678
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,320
Is that what you really think?

679
01:06:25,737 --> 01:06:27,362
I don't think.

680
01:06:28,112 --> 01:06:30,528
I think nothing.
I clear out my head.

681
01:06:35,695 --> 01:06:37,653
It's like there's a desert inside.

682
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:41,362
I listen to the wind blow.

683
01:06:42,653 --> 01:06:43,903
And I move forward.

684
01:06:45,153 --> 01:06:46,153
That's all.

685
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,737
I move forward.

686
01:06:53,695 --> 01:06:54,862
Look at him.

687
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:58,820
Look.

688
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:02,653
Still waters run deep.

689
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,028
Stop with your dumb proverbs.

690
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:06,362
Look at him.

691
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:22,820
You two are out of your minds!

692
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:26,445
We'd be in deep shit
if we let him run.

693
01:07:26,612 --> 01:07:27,903
You have no idea!

694
01:07:33,612 --> 01:07:35,653
You're okay
sending him to die?

695
01:07:36,903 --> 01:07:38,653
I'm the bastard, is that it?

696
01:07:38,987 --> 01:07:41,737
You're humanists.
I'm a dumb, obedient cop.

697
01:07:41,903 --> 01:07:44,695
Yes, I follow orders. It's my job.

698
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:47,153
It's yours too. Dammit!

699
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,903
You're all pissing me off!

700
01:07:56,653 --> 01:07:58,028
Yes, what now?

701
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:03,987
Martine, I'm working.

702
01:08:04,362 --> 01:08:06,487
Understand? Working!

703
01:08:07,445 --> 01:08:11,070
Unlike you, on my ass
popping pills and watching TV.

704
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:13,945
We'll deal with this later.
Okay? Later.

705
01:08:23,528 --> 01:08:25,195
Pain in the fucking ass!

706
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:29,612
TN12, it's cutting out.
No-signal zone.

707
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,028
You have 6 minutes.

708
01:08:33,195 --> 01:08:35,487
Do as you please.
I wash my hands of it.

709
01:09:18,528 --> 01:09:20,320
You played your game well.

710
01:09:22,612 --> 01:09:23,570
Fuck...

711
01:09:24,653 --> 01:09:26,112
Unbelievable.

712
01:09:27,778 --> 01:09:29,570
It's a topsy-turvy world.

713
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,487
What?

714
01:10:01,987 --> 01:10:03,612
Got a problem with that?

715
01:10:05,445 --> 01:10:06,862
Go on, say so.

716
01:10:08,778 --> 01:10:10,612
Got a problem with alcohol?

717
01:10:19,195 --> 01:10:21,320
Only remedy that works.

718
01:11:08,237 --> 01:11:11,028
Martine, where are you?
Why won't you answer?

719
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,403
Now I'm worried.

720
01:11:13,862 --> 01:11:16,028
Bravo, you won, call me back.

721
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,237
If I ever had to shoot myself,

722
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:48,112
I'd come here.

723
01:13:04,153 --> 01:13:06,278
What the fuck is he doing?

724
01:13:11,112 --> 01:13:12,862
Enough already, get lost!

725
01:13:13,403 --> 01:13:15,028
Go, we'll keep quiet.

726
01:13:15,278 --> 01:13:16,570
We'll keep quiet!

727
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:18,403
Wait...

728
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:20,278
Here, take this.

729
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,112
Go on, run.

730
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:23,778
Move it, move it!

731
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:25,320
Beat it!

732
01:13:25,487 --> 01:13:26,570
Go on, go on!

733
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:28,362
I don't believe this!

734
01:13:46,112 --> 01:13:47,195
Forget it.

735
01:13:47,362 --> 01:13:48,195
Why?

736
01:13:48,362 --> 01:13:50,653
He thinks we want to kill him.

737
01:13:56,903 --> 01:13:57,945
Wait.

738
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,612
Now the airport. Get in.

739
01:14:03,778 --> 01:14:05,070
What's got into you?

740
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:08,195
Stick your consciences up your asses.
Get in.

741
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,653
- We almost...
- That's enough!

742
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:12,570
You're fucking pains!

743
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:16,778
I can't take it anymore.

744
01:14:17,403 --> 01:14:18,528
Enough!

745
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,612
He won't run an inch.

746
01:14:24,778 --> 01:14:26,903
Stop bothering him and get in.

747
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:29,237
Good dog.

748
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:32,403
A good little retriever. Great.

749
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,070
Get in.

750
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:40,070
Stop showing off.
Let's finish the job.

751
01:14:40,487 --> 01:14:42,528
You got no balls, do you?

752
01:14:43,528 --> 01:14:45,112
Not yours, in any case.

753
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:50,653
Get in.

754
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,987
What if I refuse?
What then?

755
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:56,028
You'll call the cops?

756
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:57,403
That's enough.

757
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,778
Everyone, get in. Let's go.

758
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:05,653
Get in!

759
01:18:30,028 --> 01:18:31,695
The file, please.

760
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,195
Hey. What's he like?

761
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:36,778
Cooperative.

762
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:38,945
This way, sir.

763
01:18:39,112 --> 01:18:40,278
Come.

764
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:42,903
Go inside. We'll search you.

765
01:18:46,403 --> 01:18:50,028
You leave today. Understand?
You take the plane.

766
01:18:51,195 --> 01:18:52,487
We'll search you.

767
01:18:54,403 --> 01:18:55,820
Can we go now?

768
01:18:56,362 --> 01:18:58,403
You must wait till takeoff.

769
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,695
Are you kidding? Wait an hour?

770
01:19:02,528 --> 01:19:04,195
Yes, and I'm being nice.

771
01:19:04,362 --> 01:19:06,362
Rule is you wait 2 hours,

772
01:19:06,528 --> 01:19:08,862
till the point of no-return.

773
01:19:22,487 --> 01:19:24,237
Are you hazing us?

774
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,778
Because we're not Escort Crew?

775
01:19:27,653 --> 01:19:30,612
Not at all, it's just procedure.

776
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:05,987
- You okay?
- No...

777
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:09,195
I don't feel well. Can we stop?

778
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:12,445
Virginie, what are you doing?

779
01:24:22,862 --> 01:24:24,987
We're in charge of security.

780
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:26,778
It's under control.

781
01:24:26,945 --> 01:24:28,612
He was agitated, but...

782
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:30,445
Why the Velcro cuffs?

783
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,070
They never come off. Procedure.

784
01:24:33,487 --> 01:24:34,778
- He's calm.
- He's dangerous.

785
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,612
Don't fall for his victim act.

786
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:59,070
...he's capable of anything...

787
01:25:05,862 --> 01:25:07,945
...want to take that risk?

788
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,778
We'll remove him.

789
01:26:02,237 --> 01:26:03,737
Watch out for mosquitos.

790
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:05,987
They carry malaria here.

791
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:11,903
There are rabbits.

792
01:26:14,445 --> 01:26:16,570
I'm so damn stupid.

793
01:26:19,112 --> 01:26:22,862
Talking about rabbits,
not the stuff I want to say.

794
01:26:27,612 --> 01:26:29,028
Like what?

795
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,945
Even if you're crazy,

796
01:26:39,237 --> 01:26:41,195
life is less boring with you.

797
01:27:04,278 --> 01:27:08,445
Remember the schizo who killed his son,
then himself.

798
01:27:08,945 --> 01:27:09,987
Yeah.

799
01:27:10,362 --> 01:27:12,237
Remember the mom's cries?

800
01:27:13,987 --> 01:27:15,903
I still remember the address.

801
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:17,445
The floor.

802
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:19,237
I remember the door code.

803
01:27:19,403 --> 01:27:21,237
Want me to tell you?

804
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:26,570
I'm no retriever dog.

805
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:51,612
Thanks for calming down
the Customs agents.

806
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,987
Don't exaggerate.

807
01:27:56,528 --> 01:27:59,653
I did damage control.
They'll report us.

808
01:28:01,195 --> 01:28:02,778
A fucking report.

809
01:28:06,195 --> 01:28:08,653
20 years of service, not one blemish

810
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,987
and you stir up the shit.

811
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:13,112
I feel dirty.

812
01:28:13,945 --> 01:28:16,153
I lied to cover your asses.

813
01:28:17,153 --> 01:28:18,695
What got into you two?

814
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,612
Jesus...

815
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:23,028
What got into you?

816
01:28:23,403 --> 01:28:25,653
What did you buy him, 2 days?

817
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,445
You don't think
he'll be on the next plane?

818
01:28:28,778 --> 01:28:30,028
You never know.

819
01:28:31,278 --> 01:28:34,653
- If the European Court rules...
- Yeah, right.

820
01:28:37,195 --> 01:28:38,820
Keep lying to yourself.

821
01:29:19,403 --> 01:29:20,903
Not going home, chief?

822
01:29:21,237 --> 01:29:23,778
No, as you can see, I'm not.

823
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,362
See you tomorrow.

824
01:29:31,778 --> 01:29:32,820
Yep.

825
01:29:51,945 --> 01:29:55,320
<i>No use coming home.</i>
<i>I changed the lock.</i>

826
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:35,945
47, 48, 49...

827
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:52,820
60.

828
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:15,862
I'll keep my clothes.
You don't mind?

829
01:32:20,612 --> 01:32:23,320
Just your hands on my arms, my back...

830
01:32:27,153 --> 01:32:28,487
Gently.

831
01:32:34,778 --> 01:32:38,195
Just my back and arms.
Don't bother on my skin.

832
