1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:32,700
--== McEphie ==--

2
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,038
Are they here?

3
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,232
No, not yet. But they will be soon.

4
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,116
How soon?

5
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,675
There are only a few dances left.

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,235
Hopefully more.

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,194
God willing,
we'll make it through the night.

8
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,633
This?

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,355
I won't need that in the forest.

10
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,711
We're leaving too many things behind.

11
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,998
We're taking too many things
we don't need.

12
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,793
Come here a moment.

13
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,038
There isn't enough time,
we have to leave...

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,913
Come here.

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,076
Listen well.

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,991
If there's one thing we must bring,
it's our faith.

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,760
Son, you have to be with me.

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,837
But I am with you.

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,191
It's one thing to be with me,

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,597
and another to believe in me.

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,952
We have to get going.

22
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,196
Why did you stop?

23
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,391
I thought I heard something.

24
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,070
- Where?
- Put that away!

25
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,840
There's nothing wrong, my child.
Let's go.

26
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,238
Mother!

27
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,515
Let me see if anyone is inside.

28
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,440
- What was that?
- The floor.

29
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,552
But otherwise, it's usable.

30
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,037
A bit of work
and it will be good as new.

31
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,198
Looks like it was abandoned
centuries ago!

32
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,879
Must be the Spanish!

33
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,038
It will be easy to fix the mess
they left behind!

34
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,635
We're already running out of wine.

35
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,837
So, what are we going to do here?

36
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,476
How long are we going to stay?

37
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,192
We'll try to live here.

38
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,152
We shouldn't worry
about wine and tobacco,

39
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,990
when the rest of the land
is in conflict.

40
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,470
Have some wine.
We'll get through this.

41
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,557
No, thank you.

42
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,116
Lunch is ready!

43
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,471
What are we having?

44
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,911
Potatoes! What were you expecting?

45
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,870
Tonight, we'll eat meat!

46
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,871
It's a good thing I brought these.

47
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,117
I thought they were for planting.

48
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,596
Yes, I will plant them!

49
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,997
I only need a few leaves
for your wound.

50
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,514
They say that these herbs
become healthier and more potent

51
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,677
if grown in the forest.

52
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,871
They come from the forest anyway.

53
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,953
They were once wild plants

54
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,756
discovered by our forefathers
a long time ago.

55
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,830
Bear it!

56
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,351
As they say,
if it hurts, it will heal.

57
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,152
What was in the forest,
and how did this happen?

58
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,511
This is a great forest!

59
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,157
I saw trees far greater
than the ones around us.

60
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,830
I saw one
wider than this whole house!

61
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,191
I think...

62
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,437
...I could walk several days and nights,

63
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,315
and I still wouldn't reach
the other end of the forest.

64
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,478
I've heard that at the end
of the forest lies the sea!

65
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,030
I'd like to reach the sea one day.

66
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,360
I think I'm more of a fisherman
than a hunter.

67
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
There are a lot of big fish
in the sea!

68
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,550
- Sometimes I dream about the sea.
- You don't like the river?

69
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,990
You caught our dinner from the river.

70
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,194
Of course! I like the river.
This forest's river.

71
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,960
The water was so cold!
There were so many fish.

72
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,795
I could fish every day
for the rest of our lives,

73
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,877
and the river
wouldn't run out of fish.

74
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,352
We'll never have meat?

75
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,759
Of course we'll have meat!

76
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,590
For example,
on special occasions,

77
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,314
like when we have fiesta.

78
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,434
I promise. One day,
I'll bring some meat home for us.

79
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,596
We need to dig up this soil.

80
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,390
What about the owner?

81
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,592
No one owns land
that's been abandoned.

82
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,554
- Should I start a fire?
- Don't!

83
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,551
Someone might notice us.

84
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,712
I lost my way.

85
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,157
Come inside.
You must be starving.

86
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,719
Mother!

87
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,351
I woke up in your hut.

88
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,711
I had some of your potatoes.

89
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,038
I was so hungry that
I finished everything in the pot.

90
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,155
Well, the hungry always find
something to eat.

91
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,317
I never got to meet my grandfather.

92
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,353
But my father told me
many stories about him.

93
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,996
My favourite is about
how he fought with snakes.

94
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,474
Snakes!

95
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,592
Don't worry!
There aren't any around here.

96
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,077
I'm not afraid of them.
Like my grandfather.

97
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,719
You see... his vegetable patch
in the forest was taken over by snakes.

98
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,872
He couldn't even
get close to the patch.

99
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,117
Neglected, it became overgrown
with weeds.

100
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,993
So my grandfather said,

101
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,319
"These evil snakes cannot reign
over my property!"

102
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,992
So he sharpened his sword
and with a friend, marched to the forest.

103
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,397
As they approached, they could hear
the angry hissing of snakes.

104
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,115
It seemed the snakes knew
they were coming.

105
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,517
Frightened, his friend
quickly climbed up a tree.

106
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,680
From the top, he could see
how my grandfather fought the snakes -

107
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,712
severing their heads with his sword,

108
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,117
or pounding them into the ground
till they were dead...

109
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,197
When he finished killing the snakes,

110
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,789
he gathered them up
into a huge pile taller than him!

111
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,950
Afterwards, he collapsed
from exhaustion.

112
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,471
Later, they extracted
all the bile from the snakes

113
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,637
and distributed it
amongst the villagers.

114
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,549
A form of medicine!
It cures many ailments.

115
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,190
You know how my grandfather
was able to do all that?

116
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,516
Because he had an amulet!

117
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,872
A pebble: round, smooth,

118
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,311
and black, which he found
inside a coconut on Good Friday.

119
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,557
It wasn't from
any ordinary coconut tree.

120
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,674
It grew in the middle of the forest
all by itself.

121
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,949
He gave the amulet to my father,

122
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,596
but people say
that lightning will take it back

123
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,679
if the keeper does bad things.

124
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,635
Then the lightning puts it back
inside another coconut in the forest.

125
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,797
Where is it now?

126
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,917
One day, I'll find it.

127
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,391
Mother...

128
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,477
Did you see her?

129
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,357
Why did you leave?

130
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,917
Why are you crying?

131
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,238
Boil some water!

132
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,672
Son! Where are you!

133
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,031
Father, I'm here!

134
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,277
Stay there! I'll come over to you!

135
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,233
What are you doing here?

136
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,397
I was looking for fruits.

137
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,079
Fruits?

138
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,080
I can give you sacks full of fruit
if you just ask.

139
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,557
Let's go home.
Your mother is worried about you.

140
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,040
- Why aren't you eating?
- I wanted to have fruit for dinner.

141
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,637
Nobody has fruit for dinner.
This is what people eat for dinner!

142
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,432
Are there as many people
as there are fruits in the forest?

143
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,711
Where do they live?

144
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,432
Listen, son...

145
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,634
If you only ate fruit, when you go
to bed you'll have stomach ache

146
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,834
and you won't be able to sleep.
Then you'll cry all night.

147
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,079
The witch will hear
and she'll come for you.

148
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,479
Mother, is the witch
human like us, or an animal?

149
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,990
Child, listen.

150
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,355
You're more talkative
than the birds!

151
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,360
A good boy does
what his father and mother say!

152
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,833
That's right...

153
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,749
Witch or no witch,
you have to be a good boy.

154
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,440
- Right, my child?
- Yes, Mother.

155
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,555
Let's go inside.

156
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,353
Yes, Mother.

157
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,320
I'll heat up your dinner.

158
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,959
What do you see in the night sky?

159
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,720
Wow, it's really beautiful tonight!

160
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,154
The evening star is as bright as ever
and it's right above the trees.

161
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,078
It will disappear in a while.

162
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,959
I can't see the night
as well as you do.

163
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,477
What do you mean?

164
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,959
In the town,
there are many people like us.

165
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,595
And many houses too.

166
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,552
It is good to live in a town

167
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,718
but the problem is
when people quarrel with one another.

168
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,792
I'll tell you a story.

169
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,238
There was once a town
near the forest.

170
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,677
The people were happy as there were
lots of animals to hunt in the forest.

171
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,554
Every day, they had meat to eat.

172
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,554
But people from another town
heard about it.

173
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,434
So they started to hunt
in the same forest.

174
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,032
Soon enough, the wild animals
started to become scarce.

175
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,951
So the two towns quarrelled
with each other.

176
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:34,873
Until... they hunted one another
rather than the wild animals.

177
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,637
In the end... they all died.

178
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,872
Because there were no more people,

179
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,233
trees started growing in the towns.

180
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,194
They grew into forests.

181
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,679
The animals grew in number
and roamed freely

182
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,391
with no people to hunt them down.

183
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,591
Your son woke up early!

184
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,552
He must be feeding the chickens.

185
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,798
I don't hear him or the chickens!

186
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,675
Your son is missing!

187
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,919
He's not a baby any more. Leave
him be. He'll be around somewhere.

188
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,359
Son!

189
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,033
Where are you?

190
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,750
I hear the Americans.

191
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,310
They're close. Listen.

192
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,390
He was so big and tall!

193
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,515
He came out of the river
and the sun was looking down on him!

194
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,318
His hair was the colour of the sun
and his body was bathed in light!

195
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,909
Your eyes hurt
if you looked at him for too long!

196
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,431
I was so afraid,
I ran away as fast as I could!

197
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,836
I got lost on the way home.

198
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,433
Father's back!

199
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,760
Something is going on in the forest.
Haven't you noticed?

200
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,194
Well you, little boy... You saw the man
in the river bathed in sunlight.

201
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,238
Because you have
the innocent eyes of a child!

202
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,114
Strange things
have entered this forest.

203
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,240
Your failing eyesight
sees many things.

204
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,158
I see them!

205
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,037
I feel them!

206
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,110
Both terrible and wonderful things!

207
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,514
You encountered the giant wild boar?

208
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,799
- Something even worse!
- The witch!

209
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,071
Much worse than that!

210
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,752
It's the evil army
that's been taking over the town.

211
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,792
Now they're here in the forest.

212
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,071
You're scaring the boy.

213
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,711
Listen. Don't worry.

214
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,958
The Saviour
to whom this forest belongs

215
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,152
will destroy the evil outsiders!

216
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,590
You saw him in the river, right?

217
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,237
The one bathed in light,
he will protect us and the forest!

218
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,992
We must find the amulet that lightning
has hidden back in the forest.

219
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,510
The time has come
for someone to find it!

220
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,869
I will find it.

221
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,117
I will make my grandfather proud!

222
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,520
Its power will save us.

223
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,789
Let me tell you
about my brave grandfather...

224
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,231
How he fought snakes
with the amulet in his mouth!

225
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,750
- Snakes!
- That's enough!

226
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,196
It's not good
to speak of snakes while eating.

227
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,990
Son! Where are you?

228
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,077
Father, I'm here!

229
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,438
Father!

230
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,831
Father...

231
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,119
Let's go home.

232
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,192
Father...

233
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,879
Father...

234
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,192
Mother...

235
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,439
Mother...

236
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,275
Where did you come from, boy?

237
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,278
Up there?
