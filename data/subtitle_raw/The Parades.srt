1
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,875
No...

2
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,708
Ryo.

3
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,750
Ryo.

4
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,250
Ryo!

5
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,250
Ryo!

6
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,125
Ryo!

7
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,708
Somebody!

8
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,375
Anyone here?!

9
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,708
Is anyone here?!

10
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,750
- All right, listen up.
- Yes, sir.

11
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,833
There might be more people
under the rubble. We should...

12
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,291
Excuse me! I can't find my son!

13
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,916
Where are the rescued...

14
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,208
Ryo.

15
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,958
Mr. Kanda. You're okay.

16
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,125
Yuko, are you all right?

17
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,166
I'll get some blankets.

18
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,916
Have you seen my son?

19
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,791
Mr. Kanda.

20
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,416
What's going on?

21
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,625
Hello?

22
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,875
Somebody...

23
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,541
It's not safe in there!

24
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,333
Wait.

25
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,458
Wait.

26
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,708
Hey!

27
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,291
Are you okay?

28
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,416
Thank goodness.

29
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,291
I woke up washed up on the beach.

30
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,208
No one is responding to me
and I can't feel any physical touch.

31
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,125
I didn't know what was going on
and then you called out...

32
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,458
I understand.

33
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,833
First...

34
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,416
Let's try to calm down first.

35
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,583
Take a deep breath.

36
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,125
It was a pretty big one.

37
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,916
For now, come to our place.

38
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,666
Oh, can you walk?

39
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,625
Like I said,

40
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,416
I came up with the idea
for this star sand.

41
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,375
Okay?

42
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,458
You've seen these
in souvenir shops, right?

43
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,041
I used to buy them for my family
on work trips.

44
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,458
Right?

45
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,333
That's all me.

46
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,125
There he goes again.

47
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,583
It's the truth, okay?

48
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,125
You see, I participated
in a student protest, right?

49
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:58,291
I went completely broke back then,
so I ran away to Iriomote Island.

50
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,041
And you stuffed the sand in bottles
and sold them, right? We heard.

51
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,541
Oh, do we have a new guest?

52
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,291
Oh...

53
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,333
From that earthquake?

54
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,750
Probably.

55
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,083
Well, hi there.

56
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,958
You must've been through a lot.

57
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:43,875
That...

58
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,875
It was huge.

59
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,375
Michael.

60
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,875
Um, what's this place?

61
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,083
Well...

62
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,125
It's hard to explain, but...

63
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,500
It's all right.

64
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,041
Don't worry.

65
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,708
We've got plenty of time, okay?

66
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,583
Kaori, give her a tour.

67
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,208
Sure. I'm Kaori.

68
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,166
This way.

69
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,583
I'm sorry.

70
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,333
What is all this?

71
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,583
I-I don't want to explain.

72
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,166
Well...

73
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,916
People who have regrets
in the living world are gathered here.

74
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,291
Well, it's not just here.

75
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,250
There are places like this
all over the country.

76
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,833
Regrets?

77
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you mean?

78
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,000
Hey, Akira.

79
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,291
Don't beat around the bush.

80
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,250
Then you tell her, Shori.

81
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:06,583
So basically, you died.

82
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,583
But you can't go over to the other side
because you have some unfinished business.

83
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,208
Died?

84
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,000
I died...

85
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,125
Now, now. Come on.
Get some rest for today.

86
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,208
We have alcohol too.

87
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,416
I don't want any.

88
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,041
Come with me, okay?

89
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,083
You'll be fine.

90
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,458
There's probably a guy.

91
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,375
Probably.

92
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,708
Really? At her age?

93
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:26,916
Hang on.

94
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,458
This way.

95
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,708
The last occupant left.

96
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,500
So feel free to stay here.

97
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,666
I know it's a lot to handle all at once.

98
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,625
So get a good night's rest.

99
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,083
Are you all the same as me?

100
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,125
That's right.

101
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,041
We're your seniors.

102
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,916
We're quite the experts.

103
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,791
Goodnight.

104
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:22,125
<i>Here's your baby. Congratulations.</i>

105
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,458
Why won't you understand?!

106
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,375
I'm...

107
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,958
That's what you want!

108
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,500
<i>Mind your own business!</i>

109
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,791
There, there.

110
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,916
Ryo, come here.

111
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,833
Scary!

112
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,166
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

113
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,375
Congratulations!

114
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,458
- Look.
- Move.

115
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,916
What are you doing?!

116
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,125
Mommy, look.

117
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,250
Stop!

118
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,791
Hurry up and go.

119
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,041
- I don't want to go!
- Why? I have to go to work!

120
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,791
<i>I don't want to go to school!</i>

121
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,250
<i>Mommy.</i>

122
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,125
<i>Wake up.</i>

123
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,125
- <i>Mommy!</i>
- Ryo!

124
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,666
- Hey.
- Morning.

125
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,625
Good morning.

126
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,208
Hey.

127
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,250
Hi there.

128
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
Good morning.

129
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,458
Good morning.
Kaori, I'd like some coffee too.

130
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,416
Sure thing.

131
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:39,958
Here.

132
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:49,916
What's that?

133
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,541
It's yoga.

134
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,500
A dead person doing yoga
and trying to stay healthy?

135
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,875
Shut it.

136
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,291
Yoga.

137
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,375
I'm the one who brought yoga to Japan.

138
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,333
Enough already.

139
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,375
It's the truth.

140
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,541
That's how I hurt my back. Right here.

141
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,458
Good morning.

142
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,750
Hey, miss. Good morning.

143
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,166
You look cute in daylight.

144
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,791
What's your name?

145
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,250
Minako Kawakami.

146
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,083
Minako.

147
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,000
Man, really. You're pretty.

148
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,125
Michael.

149
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,916
You can't say things like that
in this day and age.

150
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,333
What? Really? Why?

151
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,041
This old man here is Michael.

152
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,416
And the guy who brought you here is Akira.

153
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,458
That young man is Shori.

154
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,458
He used to be a yakuza.

155
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,333
That's Mr. Tanaka, a former banker

156
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,416
and I'm Kaori, a former hostess of a bar.

157
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,041
J-Join us.

158
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,208
Hey!

159
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,125
STOCK MARKET CRASH

160
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,208
1990 OCTOBER 2

161
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,125
This...

162
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,541
Well, it's an old habit of mine.

163
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,041
Can I borrow your car key?

164
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,041
Huh?

165
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,708
Oh, sure.

166
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,041
She's got a bad attitude.

167
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:21,000
PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION
ON MISSING CHILDREN LISTED BELOW

168
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,250
Chinatsu!

169
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,666
Aiko!

170
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,041
Kazuki!

171
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,541
You too?

172
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,708
I got separated from my family.

173
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,375
I thought I might find them
if I shout their names out every day.

174
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,250
But...

175
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:53,500
if they can hear me,
it means they're dead.

176
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,083
I hope...

177
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,041
you find your family too.

178
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:14,458
The highway acted as a breakwater,
so urban areas were less affected.

179
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,208
We haven't found Kawakami yet.

180
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,833
Let's hope she's safe.

181
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,541
The rescue teams are doing their best
to find the missing people.

182
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,041
What we can do right now
is to work with the police

183
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,791
and report accurate news promptly.

184
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:30,708
Get to work.

185
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,458
Yes, sir.

186
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,666
Mr. Kanda, I'm right here.

187
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,333
- Oh, welcome back.
- Hi.

188
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,500
Uh, yeah.

189
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, thank you.

190
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,958
Great timing.
We're having hot pot tonight.

191
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,375
You wanna join us?

192
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,166
Sorry, I'm not in the mood for it.

193
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,458
That's exactly why you should come.

194
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,833
Okay?

195
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,708
Oh...

196
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,583
<i>It is now autumn</i>

197
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,791
<i>At this empty beach</i>

198
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:12,541
<i>Even if</i>

199
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:17,916
<i>A single dream breaks</i>

200
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,333
His one-thousandth time.

201
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,208
<i>I won't forget you</i>

202
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:27,875
<i>Because I promised the sand</i>

203
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:32,500
<i>No matter how sad I am</i>

204
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,750
<i>I will not die</i>

205
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,916
"Empty Beach."

206
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,208
I-It's such a good song. Right, Shori?

207
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,333
Sure, sure.

208
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,791
Minako, do you want to sing something?

209
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,083
No thanks.

210
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,291
Yeah? That's a shame.

211
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,833
Okay, here it is. The hot pot's ready!

212
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,833
Come on.

213
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,416
- Done.
- Come here.

214
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,041
Thank you.

215
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So heavy!

216
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,625
Kaori's special hot pot!

217
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,208
Looks good!

218
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,375
- Have some meat.
- Come on. Let's eat.

219
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,583
Meat gives you energy.

220
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:26,083
- Let's dig in.
- Let's eat.

221
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,041
Yum!

222
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,583
Um...

223
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,958
Do you all have regrets
in the living world?

224
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,833
Well, yeah.

225
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,000
R-Regret is all we have.

226
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,125
Is that why you're all lazing around?

227
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,000
I wouldn't say we're lazing around.

228
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,375
Huh?

229
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,666
Well, I guess it does look like
we're just fooling around.

230
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,416
I don't mean to be rude,

231
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,916
but I can't waste my time like this.

232
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,125
Minako.

233
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:26,625
Could you stick around for just today?

234
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:30,958
Why?

235
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,125
Because

236
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,416
we might be able to help you.

237
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,208
Y-Yeah. That's what I was going to say.

238
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,708
Yeah, right.

239
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,000
It's time. Hurry up and eat!

240
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,375
Hurry.

241
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,000
Hi there.

242
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,750
We can't start without doing this, right?

243
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,291
Start what?

244
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:14,000
We always do this as a purification ritual
before making films.

245
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,666
He's a self-proclaimed film producer.

246
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:21,208
Come see when you have time.
They're all masterpieces.

247
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,958
Y-You can watch them all
in the cinema over there.

248
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,083
All right. Let's get going.

249
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,208
Okay, then. Let's go.

250
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,083
What's everyone doing?

251
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:32,916
Once a month,

252
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:37,458
on the night of a new moon,
we all get together and search.

253
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,041
What?

254
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,666
We search for the ones we're looking for.

255
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,708
This is so strange.

256
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,458
I didn't think I'd be with people
when I died.

257
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,000
Shori.

258
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:57,666
Trying to make sense of a contradiction
is a contradiction in itself.

259
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,500
That's true.

260
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,416
Oh, hey. Hey!

261
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,333
I found them.

262
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,458
Chinatsu.

263
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,375
Dear...

264
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,208
Aiko.

265
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,875
- Dad.
- Dad...

266
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,958
Kazuki.

267
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:30,958
I'm sorry.

268
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,375
Strange, isn't it?

269
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,708
We're dead, but we're here.

270
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:42,375
We definitely exist in this world.

271
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,208
We exist.

272
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,625
I'm sorry.

273
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,958
I couldn't protect you.

274
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,916
My back hurts.

275
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:08,250
Kaori, beer please.

276
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,208
Okay.

277
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,416
Here.

278
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,375
- Thank you.
- Does Minako want any?

279
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:16,958
I'll give it to her.

280
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,625
Thanks.

281
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,541
Here.

282
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,416
What did you think?

283
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,333
What?

284
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:31,750
Uh...

285
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,208
I was surprised...

286
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:37,541
and confused.

287
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:39,666
Who wouldn't be?

288
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,708
Minako,
I hope you find your boyfriend soon too.

289
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,416
Hey! That's enough.

290
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,833
Why?

291
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:49,708
It's my son.

292
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,583
I...

293
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,958
I have a son I raised alone named Ryo.
He's seven.

294
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:06,583
My only concern is
whether he's alive or not.

295
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:21,416
Will you let me stay here a little longer?

296
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,208
Thumbs up to that.

297
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,750
O-Of course you can.

298
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,083
We'll find him.

299
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,625
Thumbs up?

300
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,458
Thumbs up then.

301
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:41,958
Thumbs up.

302
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,166
Right, come here. Let's have a toast.

303
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,333
We understand.

304
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,541
Kaori.

305
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,291
- All right. Cheers.
- Cheers.

306
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,875
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

307
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,333
It's open.

308
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,791
Oh, come in.

309
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,083
W-What are these?

310
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,625
These are the notes I've been taking.

311
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,625
But you know,

312
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,916
I'll summarize them into one story.
I <i>am</i> an author.

313
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,375
Right.

314
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,041
Something wrong?

315
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:06,500
Um, thank you for asking me
to stick around the other day.

316
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,416
I feel a little better.

317
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,583
No worries.
I know what you're going through.

318
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,000
Are you looking for someone too?

319
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,375
Oh, no. I'm not.

320
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:25,250
I just want to take note of all this.

321
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,583
I want to keep a record that
there's a world like this after we die.

322
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,791
Is that your unfinished business?

323
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,791
I'm not sure.

324
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,958
Oh. You want the car, right?

325
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,791
You can use it whenever you want.

326
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,708
Thank you.

327
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,666
We'll definitely find him.

328
00:31:59,041 --> 00:31:59,875
Don't worry.

329
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:06,208
You can rely on us more.

330
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,583
Minako.

331
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,875
Please let me interview you sometime.

332
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,166
Tell me about your life.

333
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,333
If you'd like.

334
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,958
Hi there.

335
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,541
Hey.

336
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,458
Nice.

337
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,208
Looking good.

338
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,416
Shut up.

339
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:55,708
I made a yakuza film a long time ago.

340
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,750
One of those half-assed films, right?

341
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:02,166
No, it's a very good one.
I'll show it to you sometime.

342
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,291
Sure, sure.

343
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,750
Okay, I'm off.

344
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,208
CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY
CONFERENCE IN CHAOS

345
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,208

346
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,875
DECEASED

347
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,416
They haven't found Minako yet, huh?

348
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,291
MISSING
FROM HOSHISUNA, MINAKO KAWAKAMI (35)

349
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:03,125
Boss, happy birthday.

350
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,125
Congratulations.

351
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,458
I appreciate it.

352
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,250
Drink up.

353
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,791
Thank you.

354
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,000
Dad, happy birthday.

355
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,208
Eat.

356
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,208
Thank you.

357
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:23,708
WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE?

358
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,250
I'm back.

359
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,166
Hi.

360
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,041
Kaori, b-beer please.

361
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,083
Sure thing.

362
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,000
- I'll leave it here.
- Yeah.

363
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,583
What's wrong, Shori?

364
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,666
You look glum.

365
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,541
Huh? Do I?

366
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,583
Today was your dad's birthday, right?

367
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:48,625
How was he?

368
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:55,250
Well, he's gotten pretty old.

369
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:56,791
Well, yeah.

370
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:00,291
It's already been seven years
since you came here.

371
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,916
I wonder sometimes.

372
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,500
That it wouldn't have been this way
if I stayed by his side.

373
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,541
I made a yakuza film before.

374
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:17,291
But the yakuza t-today have it rough.

375
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,458
They're a symbol of society.

376
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:24,750
B-But they were separated from society
and they're not even given human rights.

377
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,625
I'll show it to you
when you come to the cinema next time.

378
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:33,333
Yeah, okay. I got it.

379
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,583
What's your unfinished business, Shori?

380
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,166
What's with the sudden interest?

381
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,000
I told my story to everyone.

382
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:58,750
I ended up here because I was killed
in a yakuza conflict seven years ago.

383
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:05,500
I left my wife behind.

384
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,458
Huh? You were married?

385
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,583
Well, not exactly a wife.

386
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,083
It wasn't official.

387
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,875
He's actually quite a softie.

388
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,541
What? Keep your mouth shut.

389
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:27,666
You've been looking for her
for seven years?

390
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:32,375
Well, I'm not really sure.

391
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,041
Maybe I don't want to see her.

392
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,583
It's not like I can hold her anymore.

393
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:56,750
WHAT HAPPENS
IF UNFINISHED BUSINESS IS LEFT UNRESOLVED?

394
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,500
Hello?

395
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,500
<i>Is everyone else safe?</i>

396
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,875
<i>I see. Let's do our best.</i>

397
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:08,500
<i>Yeah.</i>

398
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,041
<i>Bye.</i>

399
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,125
1970, OKINAWA

400
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:23,333
<i>It is now autumn</i>

401
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,916
<i>At this empty...</i>

402
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,750
Sasaki, Tamashiro was arrested.

403
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:33,958
I see.

404
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,833
Authorities are coming with an iron fist.

405
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,958
They're coming for you next.

406
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,791
Keep a low profile.

407
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:43,916
I know.

408
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:49,208
Tamashiro's arrest will be
the headline for tomorrow's flyer.

409
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,375
Yeah.
I'll get it done by the end of the day.

410
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,083
So, Maiko.

411
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,125
See you tomorrow.

412
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,666
Koga.

413
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:10,500
Are you all right?

414
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:14,500
Yeah.

415
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,625
<i>Don't worry.</i>

416
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:23,791
<i>The other day our comrade, Tamashiro,
was unlawfully arrested on the street.</i>

417
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:28,541
<i>We will never give in to
such oppression from the authorities!</i>

418
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,916
That's right!

419
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,041
<i>Now is the time for students...</i>

420
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,541
<i>We cannot let you
occupy the university any longer.</i>

421
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,541
<i>Remove the barricade
and come out immediately.</i>

422
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,458
Sprechchor!

423
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,625
<i>Sprechchor!</i>

424
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,750
<i>Give Okinawa back to us!</i>

425
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,875
Give Okinawa back to us!

426
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,958
<i>We're against the Vietnam War!</i>

427
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,083
We're against the Vietnam War!

428
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,958
<i>Remove the U.S. military base!</i>

429
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,500
Remove the U.S. military base!

430
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,833
Charge!

431
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,416
<i>Unite!</i>

432
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:05,916
<i>Unite!</i>

433
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,833
<i>Unite!</i>

434
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,458
<i>Unite!</i>

435
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,125
Koga!

436
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,125
What time is it?

437
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,041
It's still midnight. You should lie down.

438
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,083
Does it hurt?

439
00:42:58,708 --> 00:42:59,666
You scared me!

440
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,416
Sorry. I kind of just walked in.

441
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,041
M-M-Minako.

442
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,750
W-What a surprise.

443
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:11,208
What was that film called?

444
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:15,541
Oh. <i>In Search for Lost Time</i>.

445
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,916
It's great, right?

446
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:21,500
Yeah. It ended halfway though.

447
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:26,875
Yeah, I know.
It's not complete because I died.

448
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,958
Really?

449
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:36,666
This film will leave a very huge impact
on young people today.

450
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,458
It's incredible.

451
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:44,916
The poster was going to be Maiko,
the heroine, standing alone on the beach.

452
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,666
And bam! The title right on top.

453
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,708
It was going to be a huge hit.

454
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,416
The poster was decided already?

455
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,000
O-O-Of course it was.

456
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:58,000
I was the decision-maker for everything.

457
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,625
The theme, story, and all of it.

458
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:07,916
But why did you want to
shoot a film about a student protest?

459
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,333
Oh, this.

460
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,375
This is a true story about me.

461
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:15,833
It's an autobiography?

462
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,291
Not exactly...

463
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:20,208
You see,
I was participating in a student protest.

464
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:24,125
Regardless of
whether it was right or w-wrong,

465
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:25,666
there was unity.

466
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,500
Films are the same.

467
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:32,958
A bunch of grown-ups working passionately
towards the same goal. It's amazing.

468
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:37,250
You really loved films, huh?

469
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,583
Yeah.

470
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:45,375
If it's an autobiography,
was Maiko your girlfriend?

471
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:50,166
Yeah, well. I-I guess s-she was.

472
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,416
What happened to you two?

473
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:59,041
Well, you know. A-A lot happened.

474
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:06,458
But I wish
she could've seen the completed film.

475
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,541
I think she might still be waiting.

476
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:22,291
Nah.

477
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,791
I wonder.

478
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:31,750
I'm home.

479
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,916
Welcome back.

480
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,500
Hey, dinner's ready.

481
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:38,333
<i>Come on, Kenta.</i>

482
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,708
<i>She said dinner's ready.</i>

483
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,000
Hey, Kenta. Stop playing your game.

484
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,250
- Riko, this is for Mom.
- Okay.

485
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,250
Kenta! I said dinner.

486
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,416
Here.

487
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,166
You?

488
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,416
The usual amount.

489
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,833
- Kenta?
- I want a lot.

490
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,208
A lot... This good?

491
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,416
Yeah, thanks.

492
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:10,500
Kenta, you're gobbling up the food.

493
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:13,833
So? How are your club activities going?

494
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:14,791
Seconds.

495
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,666
- You have a match next week?
- Yeah.

496
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,166
Think you can win?

497
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:22,833
Piece of cake.

498
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:26,208
- They were mercy-ruled last time.
- Don't say that!

499
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,208
W-Why'd you...

500
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,833
I saw that game too.

501
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,583
Don't bring it up.

502
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,208
The baby kicked.

503
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,125
Really?

504
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,750
Wait, hold on...

505
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:36,666
Do it again.

506
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,208
- The baby kicked!
- Yeah.

507
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,458
- Kenta.
- I'm good.

508
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:44,375
Come.

509
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:01,916
It's vintage, but it's still usable.

510
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:05,750
Look, it's so shiny.

511
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:07,833
Hey, Minako.

512
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,375
Good morning.

513
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:11,666
What are you doing?

514
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:16,750
I was deeply moved
by your words yesterday!

515
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:18,833
What? Which words?

516
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:22,166
Why did you get him worked up?
I've got plans today.

517
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,000
Seriously, I'm not following.

518
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,875
Minako, you worked in TV, right?

519
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,541
More like a journalist.

520
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,000
Okay, then. Take this.

521
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:34,541
Listen,

522
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,000
I decided to complete that film.

523
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,291
Come again?

524
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:45,000
All right. Everyone listen.

525
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:50,125
TV shows come and go,
but films are unforgettable.

526
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:53,208
I can't have you doing this halfheartedly.

527
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,625
So what are we supposed to...

528
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:59,875
Right. Akira, you look slow.
So you can hold this.

529
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,625
What? This?

530
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,166
Kaori, you do the recording.

531
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,875
Wow, that's an important job.

532
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,791
- Tanaka, you're the assistant director.
- Yes.

533
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:09,875
Yes.

534
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:12,208
And Shori.

535
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:15,666
Y-You're good looking,
s-so you can play my son.

536
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,708
Here's the script.

537
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:17,666
What?

538
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,666
IN SEARCH FOR LOST TIME

539
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,666
Michael, you're the director?

540
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,458
I'm the lead and the director.
It's Yang Ik-june style.

541
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,625
What? What style?

542
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,958
- Huh?
- Okay, then.

543
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:32,916
Let's begin.

544
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,833
Take one.

545
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,833
Ready.

546
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,375
Start.

547
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,500
It's been...

548
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:53,833
50 years since then.

549
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,208
What's next?

550
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:03,291
- "I want to see her again."
- Huh? What?

551
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,208
What?

552
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,208
"I want to see her again."

553
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:07,125
Cut!

554
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,416
Ready, roll!

555
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:18,875
What was it?

556
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,333
Um...

557
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,750
Oh, your board is in the shot.

558
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,916
"I want to see her again."

559
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,083
It's not about the lines.

560
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,208
It's the emotion.

561
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,375
Okay. Once more.

562
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,041
I'm into it already.

563
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,750
It doesn't open smoothly.

564
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,375
"I want to see her again."

565
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,333
I know that.

566
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,666
Too bright!

567
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,416
How long do I have to wait?

568
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,166
Just get into...

569
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,791
Watch me and prepare for your role.

570
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,125
- Let's do this in one take.
- Yeah.

571
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,083
Oh...

572
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,708
- It's been 50 years since then.
- I know that.

573
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:07,916
W-W-What? W-Why are you turning it?

574
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,833
It's nothing.

575
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,708
We can start with "It's been..."

576
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:14,125
O-Oh, well. It's still the first day.

577
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:17,458
The team is not one yet.

578
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Is that how it is?

579
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:21,083
Yes, it is.

580
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:24,333
Filmmaking is all about teamwork. Right?

581
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,416
Why are you asking me?

582
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:31,583
Anyway, I think we all need to
hold a review meeting.

583
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:35,208
Minako, I'll teach you about the camera.

584
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,125
I'm good.

585
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:37,958
- Why? Come on.
- Huh?

586
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,291
Is that a guest?

587
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,166
I'll go.

588
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,375
At such a young age...

589
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:54,791
Hello.

590
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,333
You can see me?

591
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,625
What's going on?

592
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,291
I'm new here too.

593
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,458
Let's go over there for now.

594
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:16,666
Your name?

595
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,625
Nana.

596
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,583
Hi there.

597
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,666
You like films?

598
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,583
What?

599
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,083
Nice to meet you.

600
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,625
I know. It's shocking, right?

601
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,291
I'm sorry, but...

602
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:55,708
I'm not sorry.

603
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,291
I'm so glad my shitty life ended.

604
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:05,250
We've got one very jaded kid in the house.

605
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,250
Huh? Who the hell are you?

606
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:08,791
Okay.

607
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,250
Young lady,
there's a place you can rest. Let's go.

608
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,333
That girl is you-know-what, right, Tanaka?

609
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,208
Probably.

610
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,375
Okay, I'm off.

611
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,083
Shori.

612
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:33,458
Huh?

613
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:35,666
Congratulations
starting your seventh year.

614
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,583
Shut up.

615
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,625
I'm sorry, Shori.

616
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,916
I've decided to dissolve the group.

617
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:33,208
KATO FAMILY

618
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:26,041
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
RIDE ON YOUR PRECIOUS MOTORBIKE!

619
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,375
I'm home.

620
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:41,666
Hi.

621
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:46,750
You're home early.

622
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,916
Yeah. I sent you a text.

623
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,375
I didn't realize. Sorry.

624
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,958
Curry for dinner?

625
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah, thanks.

626
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,583
Mizuki.

627
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,500
I got a day off next week.

628
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,833
Do you want to visit my parents?

629
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:12,916
I haven't had the chance to introduce you.

630
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,750
Yeah. Sounds good.

631
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:21,791
I think we should
talk about our future too.

632
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,250
You're right.

633
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,125
It's been a while.

634
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,791
You haven't changed at all.

635
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,375
He seems like a good guy.

636
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:11,333
Well, I'm better looking than him though.

637
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,375
I'm sorry.

638
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,666
Have a good life.

639
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,916
<i>...memories of you</i>

640
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,708
<i>Even if you do not return</i>

641
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,125
<i>I won't...</i>

642
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,833
- You're back late.
- Hey.

643
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,958
Kaori, I'll have a hard one.

644
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,000
Sure thing.

645
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:17,708
<i>Because I promised the sky</i>

646
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:22,625
<i>No matter how lonely I am</i>

647
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:27,708
<i>I will not die</i>

648
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,625
<i>No matter how lonely I am...</i>

649
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,666
Shori, did something happen?

650
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:35,458
<i>...I will not die</i>

651
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:36,500
I saw her.

652
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,333
What?

653
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:49,625
Seems like she's already over me.

654
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,041
She looked well.

655
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,166
I think she's getting married.

656
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,541
That's a relief, huh?

657
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:06,541
Yeah.

658
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,791
And you know what?

659
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:17,625
Her new man is such a great guy.

660
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,041
The complete opposite of me.

661
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,166
I'm so glad.

662
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:27,791
She'll be okay now.

663
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,541
I'm sure.

664
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:48,708
Hey, Shori!

665
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:52,208
Y-You haven't seen my film yet.

666
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,583
You're right.

667
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,708
I'll watch it.

668
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:00,708
Your boring yakuza film.

669
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,708
Yeah, t-that's what I'm talking about.

670
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:08,416
Then, let's go. Let's go now.

671
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,916
- Akira, get the car.
- Let's go.

672
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,916
Let's go!

673
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,625
- You're gonna be moved.
- Are you sure?

674
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:25,250
Hey, kid.

675
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,625
Make sure to live your life.

676
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,500
What?

677
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,458
<i>You have anywhere to go?</i>

678
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:51,625
<i>You wanna join us?</i>

679
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,416
<i>Boss, what are you...</i>

680
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,583
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

681
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,291
<i>Doesn't hurt to have a bigger family.</i>

682
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:01,166
<i>What's your name?</i>

683
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,250
<i>Masashi...</i>

684
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:08,958
<i>Yamada.</i>

685
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,458
So? It's good, right?

686
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,541
It's all right.

687
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:20,000
<i>Come over once things are settled.</i>

688
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,041
<i>Let's go.</i>

689
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:59,333
Shall we go?

690
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:04,250
Yeah.

691
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:34,666
I'm the one who made yoga popular.

692
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:36,333
Not again.

693
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:39,625
It was 30 years ago.
I was in advertising, right?

694
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,916
There was a fitness boom back then...

695
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,083
Shori's gone
so there's no one here to stop him.

696
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:48,250
- I was the one...
- Nana, good morning.

697
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,833
Morning.

698
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,333
Where's that yakuza guy?

699
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,458
He went to the other side.

700
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,416
Y-You're not making sense.

701
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:08,875
Do you have regrets or unfinished business
from when you were alive?

702
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:11,000
What?

703
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:14,125
I think that's the reason you're here.

704
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:20,125
You're freaking me out.
Is this some kind of cult?

705
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,583
A cult? How rude.

706
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:27,000
Oh, hey.
Do you want to shoot a film with us?

707
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,833
- Minako, shall we go?
- Ew.

708
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:30,750
Sure.

709
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,000
Nana, take a seat.

710
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:43,625
DECEASED

711
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,666
Every day,
I'm scared to look through this.

712
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:51,750
I wonder what'll happen to me
if I find Ryo's name here.

713
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:55,958
Yeah.

714
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,208
So you want to know about my life?

715
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:06,958
Yes.

716
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:12,291
I want to know more about you
before you move on to the other side.

717
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:15,625
Um...

718
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,666
I'm Minako Kawakami. 35 years old.

719
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:24,875
I was a journalist here, for Hokuto TV,
and a single mother to a seven-year-old.

720
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,333
Your husband?

721
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,916
We split up soon after Ryo was born.

722
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,875
I wanted to work but he didn't want me to.

723
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,291
Since then, it's just been Ryo and me.

724
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:44,208
What was this world like for you?

725
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,708
You mean the living world?

726
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:48,666
Yes.

727
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:54,875
I don't know.

728
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,958
I was so frantic with work and parenting.

729
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:05,375
Looking back,
I don't know why I was trying so hard.

730
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:13,750
If you could go back,
what would you like to do?

731
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,833
I want to...

732
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:25,541
go on a trip with Ryo.

733
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:29,291
Because I've never been able to
take him on one.

734
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,333
And...

735
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:38,041
I want to apologize to him.

736
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:52,666
There are lots of unknown facts
in the world we can't see,

737
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,666
such as atoms,
electrons and elementary particles.

738
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:00,708
For example, what we're experiencing is
three dimensional.

739
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,500
Four dimensional, if we add time.

740
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,958
Lisa Randall, a scientist...

741
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,375
It's gonna go viral.

742
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,875
This is genius.

743
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:11,583
Are you gonna post it?

744
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:14,625
- So true.
- Hey...

745
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:16,708
Yasuko.

746
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:21,833
Don't slit your wrist like Nana, okay?
It's so annoying.

747
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:26,666
Everything okay there?

748
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,291
- Yup.
- Sorry.

749
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:32,250
So let's review the word "dimension."

750
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:37,208
It is defined as an indicator
for measurement of space.

751
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:42,458
Okay. What is one dimension? It is a line.

752
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:47,875
Here's dessert.

753
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:51,000
Hey.

754
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,750
Oh, Nana.

755
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,458
I get that I died, but...

756
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:01,791
Can I kill a person?

757
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:05,750
There's someone I wanna kill.

758
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:09,333
Hey, Nana.

759
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:12,166
Don't say things like that.

760
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:16,708
We can't harm people in the living world
from this world.

761
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:21,750
How stupid.

762
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,583
I mean, you're all dead.

763
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:39,416
Hey.

764
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,625
It has no taste at all.

765
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:04,125
How long do I have to stay in this hell?!

766
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:22,125
Nana.

767
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,416
Why don't you come with us?

768
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,125
I want to show you something.

769
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:31,958
What?

770
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:35,125
Trust me and just tag along.

771
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,708
All right, then. Let's go!

772
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,000
Huh?

773
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:19,916
What's this?

774
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:25,166
Everyone who died and left behind
those who are important to them.

775
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,208
We all search together...

776
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,000
for the ones we are looking for.

777
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,583
The ones we're looking for...

778
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:42,125
I don't know what your regret is,

779
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:45,375
but we can help if you want.

780
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,625
Hey, over here!

781
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:02,958
I'm sorry.

782
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,041
I'm so sorry.

783
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,708
- Isn't this good?
- I got a message!

784
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:40,208
I...

785
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,875
There's someone I want to apologize to.

786
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:08,541
This is your baby's face.
There's the eyes and nose.

787
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:10,125
Here's the mouth.

788
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:13,333
I didn't want to die
until my daughter gave birth.

789
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:16,500
So, I fought my destiny and here I am.

790
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:19,625
This world is pretty lenient, isn't it?

791
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:23,291
I think so too.

792
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:28,958
I was able to be with them
for a long time.

793
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,958
I have no more regrets.

794
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:44,208
Watching my kids all this time
made me realize...

795
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:47,541
that they're very strong.

796
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:55,875
Maybe they would've been fine without me
from the start.

797
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,875
I think that sometimes.

798
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:08,958
That's not true.

799
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:20,125
DAY 32, NOTHING ON SHELTER'S NOTICEBOARD
HOKUTO TV, NO PROGRESS

800
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:26,250
Oh my, Michael.

801
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:28,625
Hey, why are you sleeping here?

802
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:32,166
Let's go to your room, okay?
Mr. Tanaka, give me a hand.

803
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,083
Okay.

804
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,291
Wake up.

805
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:38,166
Michael, you ready?

806
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,500
One, two, lift.

807
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,666
Okay, let's walk.

808
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,083
He's so drunk.

809
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:56,666
Is it going well?

810
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,541
Yes. I enjoy writing.

811
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,958
I can't see the end though.

812
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,458
It's your turn, Akira.

813
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,833
Tell me.

814
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:19,625
What? No.
I have nothing interesting to tell.

815
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:22,958
You always dodge the question
when it's about you.

816
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,708
Do I?

817
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,583
I want to know what your life was like.

818
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,250
Minako,

819
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,041
I'm sensing the spirit of a journalist.

820
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:41,916
You're right.

821
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,291
But...

822
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,541
I guess I don't mind telling you.

823
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,833
The reason why

824
01:15:57,291 --> 01:15:59,250
I can't go to the other side.

825
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,500
Is this your...

826
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:22,958
Yes.

827
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,250
My dad looks stubborn, right?

828
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:38,958
I've always been sickly so for me,

829
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:43,208
his existence was the scariest thing
in the world.

830
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,166
Your lunch stinks.

831
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,666
What? She's picking them up.

832
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,583
What's she going to do with that?

833
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:09,541
Is she gonna eat that?

834
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:12,166
That's disgusting.

835
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:15,333
What a freak.

836
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:17,750
She got something on me. Ew.

837
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:19,625
- You okay?
- So gross.

838
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:34,958
Nana.

839
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:52,916
Y-Yasuko.

840
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,125
Yasuko, I'm sorry!

841
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,541
Nana...

842
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,458
Why...

843
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:15,375
Nana...

844
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:27,125
Nana, why...

845
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,541
Yasuko, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

846
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:37,875
I'm sorry, Yasuko.

847
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:39,875
I'm so sorry.

848
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:44,458
Why... Nana.

849
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,625
Nana.

850
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,208
I practically lived in my bed.

851
01:19:02,666 --> 01:19:06,166
I was a ranch owner's son,
but I wasn't capable of physical labor.

852
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,041
I always thought

853
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:18,041
my dad didn't accept me
as a member of the family.

854
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:36,750
When they told me my remaining days,

855
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:40,375
I thought, "Why me?"

856
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:44,916
I took it out on my family so many times.

857
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:49,416
I've hurt them a lot.

858
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,500
I think...

859
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:25,166
this is the reason why I can't move on.

860
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,375
My dad, who's never even read a book,

861
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:45,125
has been writing a novel
for many years now.

862
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,583
A story about me.

863
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,958
If I were alive,

864
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,000
maybe he wouldn't be writing a novel.

865
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:06,791
Or maybe he would've anyway.
I'll never know.

866
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:13,416
But it made me happy.

867
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,791
It felt like I finally got to know my dad.

868
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:30,333
AKIRA CHEERED ON THE NEWBORN CALF...

869
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:36,375
Though...

870
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:41,750
I only wish I had known while I was alive.

871
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,083
Nana.

872
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,666
Your room's a mess.

873
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,333
My bad.

874
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,916
What are you writing?

875
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:25,333
I'm keeping a record of everything
that's happened since I got here.

876
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,958
BEFORE GOING TO "THE OTHER SIDE"
(WORKING TITLE) CHAPTER FOURTEEN

877
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:38,833
Something wrong?

878
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,000
You know,

879
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:47,000
I apologized.

880
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,000
But...

881
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:54,583
nothing changed.

882
01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,000
Why?

883
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,875
I'm sure that one day,

884
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,958
your voice will be heard.

885
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:15,708
Don't worry.

886
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,541
That's not an answer.

887
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,666
You can borrow that.

888
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:02,750
Goodbye.

889
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:05,541
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

890
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:18,000
Minako!

891
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,291
Minako!

892
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:23,708
Minako, he's alive!

893
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,000
Y-Y-Your son! He's alive!

894
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:02,541
He's alive.

895
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:14,416
{\an8}HOSHISUNA HOME FOR CHILDREN

896
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,666
{\an8}We'll wait out here.

897
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:41,625
Ryo has a fever again.

898
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:45,916
It's already been a week. Let's take him
to see a doctor again tomorrow.

899
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,833
Okay.

900
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,041
Mommy.

901
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,041
Mommy.

902
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:20,458
Ryo, we'll go to
the doctor tomorrow, okay?

903
01:27:21,625 --> 01:27:23,666
I want to see my mommy.

904
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,458
I know.

905
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:31,291
I'm sure we'll find your mom.

906
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:00,875
Ryo.

907
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,291
I'm sorry I left you all on your own.

908
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:15,000
Mommy.

909
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,333
Mommy.

910
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:19,833
Are you there?

911
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:25,250
Yes.

912
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:27,083
I'm right here.

913
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:32,833
I wanted to apologize to you.

914
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,958
I went to pick you up from your school,

915
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:42,458
but I was washed away by the tsunami.

916
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:44,333
I'm sorry.

917
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:51,750
Mommy, we're going home together, right?

918
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,583
I wish I could.

919
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:07,750
Do I have to live here forever?

920
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:12,583
I'm so sorry.

921
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:22,708
I'll watch over you
so that you won't be alone, okay?

922
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:28,625
Okay.

923
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:30,791
Mommy.

924
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,083
Tell me a story until I fall asleep.

925
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:39,625
Sure.

926
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,333
Which story?

927
01:29:43,875 --> 01:29:47,000
Something fun you did recently.

928
01:29:58,541 --> 01:30:00,750
In the world I'm in right now,

929
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:06,833
everyone helps to find
each other's loved ones.

930
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,750
Like a parade.

931
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:11,291
That sounds amazing.

932
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,916
They helped me find you too.

933
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:20,166
I see.

934
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:26,416
Then, it's your turn to help everyone.

935
01:30:30,916 --> 01:30:31,750
Yeah.

936
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,208
You're right.

937
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:41,083
Hey, Mr. Tanaka.

938
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:44,625
Yes?

939
01:31:47,583 --> 01:31:50,041
I have one unfinished business.

940
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,875
Will you help me out?

941
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,791
If it's within my power.

942
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:03,750
Akira.

943
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:08,500
Don't give me that
"I'm so heartbroken" look.

944
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:10,750
What are you talking about?

945
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:11,666
I'm not.

946
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:15,708
Yeah, but Minako was a fox.

947
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:18,791
If I was younger, I would've...

948
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:19,708
Ew.

949
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:20,666
What?

950
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:22,250
What do you mean "Ew"?

951
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,166
Ew.

952
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:27,666
Minako.

953
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,291
I'm back.

954
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:33,708
Come here.

955
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,458
You want coffee?

956
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:36,708
Thanks, Kaori.

957
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:44,708
Michael.

958
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:48,583
I haven't thanked you properly.

959
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:50,875
Thank you.

960
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:55,666
Stop it. You're making me blush.

961
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:58,291
Your film.

962
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:02,166
Let's complete it.

963
01:33:03,541 --> 01:33:04,375
Huh?

964
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:07,583
I'll stay until we do.

965
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:09,791
You want her to see it, right?

966
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:19,500
Come on, stop it!
You're gonna make me cry.

967
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:25,333
All right. I-I'll do it. Yeah.

968
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:28,916
This film is going to be great.

969
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:30,291
You too, Nana.

970
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:32,083
What? No way.

971
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:34,458
Nana, this is mandatory.

972
01:33:34,541 --> 01:33:35,708
No way.

973
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,291
- Tanaka.
- Yes.

974
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:39,541
Get the camera.

975
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:40,625
As you wish!

976
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:41,791
All right.

977
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,083
Let's do this.

978
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:54,375
- It's rolling.
- Okay.

979
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,833
Take one.

980
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:00,750
Ready, start!

981
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,708
It's been 50 years.

982
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:23,708
This film is almost complete.

983
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:26,083
The protagonist, Koga,

984
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:30,708
believed in the revolution and
devoted himself to the student protest.

985
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,250
But in fear of getting caught,

986
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:37,875
he decides to go back to Tokyo
on the day of the protest...

987
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:41,041
<i>without his girlfriend.</i>

988
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,708
He ran away.

989
01:34:45,083 --> 01:34:46,041
The pathetic fool.

990
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:50,208
Koga, wait!

991
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:56,541
{\an8}I'm sorry.

992
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:00,375
{\an8}There's no way I can start a revolution.

993
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:05,750
{\an8}You don't have to.

994
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:08,208
Just stay with me.

995
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:20,291
We'll meet again. I promise.

996
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:44,500
<i>And so, Koga quit the student protest</i>

997
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:47,000
<i>and ran away to Tokyo.</i>

998
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:48,875
I know these will sell.

999
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:53,666
<i>Maiko married Sasaki.</i>

1000
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:57,666
<i>And Koga buried himself in work.</i>

1001
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:04,625
<i>They both lived their lives
with a lid on the past they had shared.</i>

1002
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:24,541
<i>50 years had passed.</i>

1003
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:30,500
<i>Koga returned to
the city of Okinawa again.</i>

1004
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:43,625
<i>Memories of that day come back to his mind
like it was yesterday.</i>

1005
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:50,541
M-M-Maiko...

1006
01:36:52,916 --> 01:36:54,916
He's really into it.

1007
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,250
Are you Mitsuru Koga?

1008
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:07,625
<i>And by a strange coincidence...</i>

1009
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:13,333
Koga has an encounter
with Maiko's grandchild.

1010
01:37:15,666 --> 01:37:16,583
Huh? Me?

1011
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:25,333
You know my grandma, right?

1012
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,833
Huh?

1013
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,000
Are you Maiko's...

1014
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:33,833
Please come see her.

1015
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,958
Grandma's been longing to see you.

1016
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:49,458
Cut.

1017
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:55,166
What are you, a prodigy?

1018
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:57,208
You're incredible!

1019
01:37:57,291 --> 01:37:58,500
It's a thumbs up!

1020
01:37:58,583 --> 01:37:59,416
Wonderful!

1021
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,416
Nana!

1022
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:02,750
Stop it!

1023
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:04,833
Please come see her.

1024
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:08,500
- Michael, don't!
- He's mocking me.

1025
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,750
<i>I see.</i>

1026
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:22,875
<i>You went on before me.</i>

1027
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:47,708
<i>Koga!</i>

1028
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,291
<i>Goodbye!</i>

1029
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,416
Koga,

1030
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,458
live your life to the fullest.

1031
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:13,041
<i>Koga!</i>

1032
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:24,541
Maiko.

1033
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:27,875
Maiko!

1034
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,333
<i>Maiko!</i>

1035
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:35,000
<i>Koga!</i>

1036
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:38,708
<i>Maiko!</i>

1037
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,125
Maiko!

1038
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:44,708
Michael.

1039
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:48,083
- No. Wait, Michael.
- Michael!

1040
01:39:48,166 --> 01:39:49,541
Michael!

1041
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:50,500
What's wrong?

1042
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:52,208
Maiko!

1043
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:54,000
Michael!

1044
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:55,208
Michael!

1045
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,625
<i>Maiko!</i>

1046
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,375
Let's show it on the big screen.

1047
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:31,375
Yes, let's.

1048
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:37,958
What's wrong?

1049
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:43,208
A-About that...

1050
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:49,458
I want to give this film to someone.

1051
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:55,291
But I feel really embarrassed
doing stuff like that.

1052
01:40:57,166 --> 01:41:00,166
Could you all go and do it for me?

1053
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:03,041
What? Do it yourself.

1054
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:06,083
I know, but...

1055
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,958
Michael.

1056
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,208
Let's go together.

1057
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:17,333
I'll come with you.

1058
01:41:31,416 --> 01:41:35,333
T-This is kinda nice.
This whole camaraderie thing.

1059
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,333
Okay.

1060
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:44,500
I'll go.

1061
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,208
For real? There's so many people.

1062
01:42:07,291 --> 01:42:08,375
Yeah. It's crazy.

1063
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,125
Hey, you guys.

1064
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:15,583
There's something I want to show you.

1065
01:42:15,666 --> 01:42:17,041
Come with me.

1066
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:22,083
This way.

1067
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:24,291
Look at this!

1068
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:27,541
See this?

1069
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:28,958
Is this you, Michael?

1070
01:42:29,041 --> 01:42:32,125
- You're a major producer.
- Don't flatter me.

1071
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:33,708
You weren't lying.

1072
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:35,041
Of course I wasn't.

1073
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,416
I thought you were.

1074
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:37,666
Yeah, we all did.

1075
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:38,583
See.

1076
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:40,500
Oh, wow.

1077
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:41,666
"FILM SHOULD BE FREEDOM"

1078
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,375
This is nerve-wracking.

1079
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:54,166
I-I'm really bad at stuff like this.

1080
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:58,000
You're gonna be fine.
We'll wait for you out here.

1081
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:04,833
I changed my mind.

1082
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:06,666
We came all the way out here.

1083
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:08,208
But...

1084
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:09,750
Koga. Is that you?

1085
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:14,875
S-Sasaki?

1086
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:25,333
What is it? After all this time.

1087
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:32,708
I-I want to apologize to Maiko.

1088
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,208
Please let me see her.

1089
01:43:44,541 --> 01:43:45,416
Come in.

1090
01:44:02,708 --> 01:44:06,000
Sasaki, when did you die?

1091
01:44:07,416 --> 01:44:09,250
Two years ago. Cancer.

1092
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:11,125
I see.

1093
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:15,250
What's that?

1094
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:16,916
Oh, this.

1095
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:19,833
It's my new film.

1096
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:24,791
I-It's about me, M-Maiko, and you.

1097
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:30,250
Films even after you died?

1098
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:32,458
You film freak.

1099
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:34,583
That's right.

1100
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:37,750
This is the only thing I can do.

1101
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:40,916
This way.

1102
01:45:12,541 --> 01:45:15,166
Maiko, you haven't changed at all.

1103
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:26,666
She's always been rooting for you.

1104
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:35,291
But she chose you.

1105
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:18,291
You know...

1106
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:25,541
I still think about
the time we spent back then.

1107
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:32,000
We couldn't start a revolution.

1108
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,333
But...

1109
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:40,625
We were united. That, I know for sure.

1110
01:46:51,291 --> 01:46:52,541
Maiko.

1111
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:18,166
M-Maiko.

1112
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:22,625
Sorry.

1113
01:47:28,333 --> 01:47:29,541
I'm sorry.

1114
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:53,958
Hi there.

1115
01:47:54,708 --> 01:47:55,708
Is everything okay?

1116
01:47:55,791 --> 01:47:57,958
It was perfect. Excellent.

1117
01:47:58,916 --> 01:48:00,583
You didn't give it to her?

1118
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:04,791
Yeah, but if you think about it,
you can't watch films at home.

1119
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:06,500
I'll do it when it's on DVD.

1120
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:09,250
It won't be on DVD though.

1121
01:48:09,333 --> 01:48:11,708
Oh, c-come on. It's okay.

1122
01:48:12,291 --> 01:48:14,375
Now, shall we go home?

1123
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:40,708
Hey, everyone.

1124
01:48:45,166 --> 01:48:47,708
Why don't we have a film screening?

1125
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:50,250
We can invite everyone.

1126
01:48:55,666 --> 01:48:57,416
Great idea.

1127
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:00,208
I was a-about to say that myself.

1128
01:49:00,291 --> 01:49:01,125
Really?

1129
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:02,083
Yeah.

1130
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:04,041
- Let's do that.
- Yes, let's.

1131
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:06,125
All right. We're doing this!

1132
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:25,250
Michael, we're ready.

1133
01:49:45,291 --> 01:49:46,416
Um...

1134
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:50,791
Good e-evening everyone. I'm Michael.

1135
01:49:52,666 --> 01:49:58,416
I forced my friends to help me
and we managed to complete the film.

1136
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,625
T-This f-film
has the power to revolutionize the era.

1137
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:11,583
And I also think that
it c-connects the past and the present.

1138
01:50:18,291 --> 01:50:21,291
"Films even after you died?"

1139
01:50:23,291 --> 01:50:27,958
That's what my friend said.
But hey, whoever does it first wins.

1140
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:29,750
I hope...

1141
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,916
you enjoy the film.

1142
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:00,125
So,

1143
01:52:00,916 --> 01:52:02,791
I have an idea for a new film.

1144
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:04,500
Another one?

1145
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:06,791
An autobiography.

1146
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,625
I want to make a film
about the time I've spent here.

1147
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,916
Michael, that's my idea.

1148
01:52:16,458 --> 01:52:19,208
T-Then, we can do it together.

1149
01:52:19,291 --> 01:52:22,125
This is going to be a masterpiece.

1150
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:23,458
I can't let you.

1151
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:25,583
No?

1152
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:32,250
Minako.

1153
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:33,958
You okay?

1154
01:52:34,041 --> 01:52:35,125
Oh, yes.

1155
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:39,666
It just hasn't sunk in yet.

1156
01:52:42,333 --> 01:52:43,625
Same here.

1157
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:49,583
To be honest,
I'm feeling a little uneasy too.

1158
01:52:51,208 --> 01:52:52,583
Hey, Mr. Tanaka.

1159
01:52:52,666 --> 01:52:53,500
Yes?

1160
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,250
W-What is it like on the other side?

1161
01:52:59,291 --> 01:53:00,375
I can't tell you.

1162
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:02,166
What?

1163
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:06,041
Mr. Tanaka is kind of like our warden.

1164
01:53:08,291 --> 01:53:11,666
What? Why didn't you tell me?
That's so scary.

1165
01:53:12,916 --> 01:53:15,583
O-Oh, come on. Tell us already.

1166
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:17,250
You'll find out soon anyway.

1167
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:20,791
Tanaka, you're so hard-headed.

1168
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,500
But you know what?

1169
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,375
Making the film was fun.

1170
01:53:38,333 --> 01:53:39,541
Right?

1171
01:53:40,958 --> 01:53:43,000
Films are great.

1172
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:48,916
A bunch of grown-ups w-working
passionately towards the same goal.

1173
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:51,833
It's amazing.

1174
01:53:51,916 --> 01:53:53,250
- Yeah.
- Right?

1175
01:53:55,583 --> 01:53:56,416
Nana.

1176
01:53:58,208 --> 01:53:59,791
Make more films, okay?

1177
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:02,625
You can use the notes in my room.

1178
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,125
Work hard, Nana.

1179
01:54:05,125 --> 01:54:06,291
Why only me?

1180
01:54:08,583 --> 01:54:09,416
Akira.

1181
01:54:12,166 --> 01:54:14,291
I'll leave the rest to you.

1182
01:54:19,625 --> 01:54:23,291
Make sure to keep
a detailed record of this world.

1183
01:54:26,291 --> 01:54:27,625
You can count on me.

1184
01:54:30,625 --> 01:54:34,541
But you gotta stay on the offense.
Don't lose, all right?

1185
01:54:34,625 --> 01:54:36,000
Who's he competing with?

1186
01:54:45,041 --> 01:54:47,083
Let's have a toast.

1187
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:49,750
A toast.

1188
01:54:59,291 --> 01:55:00,250
Cheers.

1189
01:55:01,083 --> 01:55:02,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1190
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,583
We still have some food left. Eat up.

1191
01:55:24,125 --> 01:55:25,125
Let's eat.

1192
01:55:26,458 --> 01:55:27,875
Could I have some of that?

1193
01:55:32,083 --> 01:55:35,000
- Have fried chicken too.
- Okay, then one please.

1194
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:35,916
Thank you.

1195
01:55:36,875 --> 01:55:39,041
Here's the fried...

1196
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:40,875
- About this much?
- Yes, thank you.

1197
01:55:40,958 --> 01:55:42,625
A little bit more...

1198
01:56:15,375 --> 01:56:22,291
...SOUND OF WAVES, AND AN EMPTY BEACH

1199
01:56:30,916 --> 01:56:31,916
Knock, knock.

1200
01:56:35,625 --> 01:56:37,416
Is everyone asleep?

1201
01:56:37,958 --> 01:56:38,791
Yeah.

1202
01:56:39,416 --> 01:56:42,333
In the end,
Michael fell asleep while talking.

1203
01:56:43,666 --> 01:56:46,875
He really is full of energy.

1204
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:54,583
Here.

1205
01:56:54,666 --> 01:56:55,541
Thanks.

1206
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:10,250
Are you going to continue writing?

1207
01:57:11,208 --> 01:57:12,041
Yes.

1208
01:57:13,208 --> 01:57:16,416
I think I will
until my dad completes his novel.

1209
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,000
I see.

1210
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:21,291
Make sure to write about me.

1211
01:57:21,916 --> 01:57:22,750
Of course.

1212
01:57:24,166 --> 01:57:26,541
You're going to be the main character.

1213
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:29,458
Don't. I just want a small part.

1214
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:37,166
I wanted to be with you

1215
01:57:39,208 --> 01:57:40,375
a little longer.

1216
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:44,125
Where's this coming from?

1217
01:57:48,125 --> 01:57:49,416
I kind of...

1218
01:57:51,041 --> 01:57:52,083
liked you.

1219
01:57:55,458 --> 01:57:56,791
What's with that confession?

1220
01:57:58,333 --> 01:57:59,166
Is it weird?

1221
01:57:59,791 --> 01:58:01,041
Yes, it's weird.

1222
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:07,541
I wonder if things would've been different

1223
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:11,125
if we met when we were alive.

1224
01:58:12,041 --> 01:58:13,833
I guess we'll never know.

1225
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:16,458
Yeah.

1226
01:58:20,541 --> 01:58:21,666
Akira.

1227
01:58:25,166 --> 01:58:28,041
Thank you. It's been fun.

1228
01:58:35,291 --> 01:58:36,208
Me too.

1229
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:38,666
Thank you.

1230
01:59:56,541 --> 01:59:57,750
Let's go.

1231
02:00:02,625 --> 02:00:04,541
Passing it to you now.

1232
02:00:04,625 --> 02:00:05,750
Watch out behind you.

1233
02:00:05,833 --> 02:00:07,458
- Thank you.
- What about this?

1234
02:00:07,541 --> 02:00:09,083
Right in the middle here.

1235
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,833
All right. Yeah.

1236
02:02:33,458 --> 02:02:35,166
Wow, so many people.

1237
02:02:50,833 --> 02:02:51,666
Ryo.

1238
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,166
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

1239
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:01,875
We still have some time.
You wanna go for tea?

1240
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:02,833
Yeah, sure.

1241
02:03:03,625 --> 02:03:04,666
You've grown.

1242
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,958
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

1243
02:03:08,125 --> 02:03:09,208
First time in Tokyo?

1244
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:10,583
Yes.

1245
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:12,916
There are so many people.

1246
02:03:13,875 --> 02:03:15,583
Yeah, compared to that place.

1247
02:03:15,666 --> 02:03:16,958
Right.

1248
02:03:18,875 --> 02:03:21,500
Are you graduating next year?

1249
02:03:22,041 --> 02:03:23,166
Yes.

1250
02:03:24,375 --> 02:03:26,625
Do you know what you want to do?

1251
02:03:27,375 --> 02:03:31,958
Well, I'm not completely sure.

1252
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:39,083
But I might want to do what my mom did.

1253
02:03:46,458 --> 02:03:49,416
Please tell me about my mom again.

1254
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,833
Sure. Of course.

1255
02:03:51,458 --> 02:03:53,958
I'm looking forward to the film today.

1256
02:03:54,041 --> 02:03:56,000
Yeah, please do.

1257
02:03:57,458 --> 02:03:58,458
Nana!

1258
02:03:59,041 --> 02:04:00,041
It's been a while.

1259
02:04:00,125 --> 02:04:01,666
Oh, hi!

1260
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:03,166
Long time no see.

1261
02:04:05,416 --> 02:04:06,541
Hello.

1262
02:04:08,125 --> 02:04:08,958
Thumbs up!

1263
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:13,333
Thumbs up!

1264
02:04:15,541 --> 02:04:17,166
Tickets please.

1265
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:19,416
- This way.
- Theater 2, please.

1266
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:20,583
I'll see you later.

1267
02:04:20,666 --> 02:04:21,500
Enjoy.

1268
02:04:24,875 --> 02:04:26,583
I'm getting nervous.

1269
02:04:26,666 --> 02:04:27,500
Yeah.
