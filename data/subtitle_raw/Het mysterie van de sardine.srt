1
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,235
Excuse me?

2
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,392
Where's Professor Boerhave's house?
- What d'you want him for?

3
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,558
What did you say?
- What d'you want him for?

4
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,149
I should discuss that with him.

5
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,909
Sounds logical.

6
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,358
I'm going that way. Give me a lift
and I'll show you the way.

7
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,751
Please don't smoke in the car.
I have valuable things with me.

8
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,069
What's up?
- I tore a muscle.

9
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,235
Oh dear.

10
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,116
Let me see.
- No, no, here.

11
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,514
Sorry, sorry.

12
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,038
Put it here.

13
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,392
Where did this paper come from?
- Wrong house.

14
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,153
The neighbours...

15
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,237
The paper boy is in love.

16
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,674
With you?
- No, with Mum.

17
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,758
What makes you think that?

18
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,158
When you run, she dances naked.
- You were asleep!

19
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,353
I had to learn Darwin!

20
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,710
Can you test me, Dad?
- Sure.

21
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,198
Boy aged 12 admitted to Oxford,
maths prodigy Jan Prent.

22
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,908
It's a Dutch name.

23
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,112
Dad. Darwin: the questions
are at the back.

24
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,074
Good thing you were nearly back home.

25
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,838
I wasn't nearly home.

26
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,989
I had a lift from a young man
looking for Professor Boerhave.

27
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,958
Where did you leave him?

28
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,670
I said Boerhave never
receives guests before 1 0 a. m.

29
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,075
So he's driving round the block.

30
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,072
Ouch! What's that for?

31
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,238
Don't look at me.
Your pain must be punishment.

32
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,034
Rubbish: I was already in pain
before I met him.

33
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,360
God used to punish after sin, but that
didn't help so now he does it before.

34
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,312
Your logic is unique.

35
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,915
Can you put this in their letter box?
You're passing.

36
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,838
Dad, Darwin...

37
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,358
The questions are at the back,
but are they the right questions?

38
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,919
Take a look.

39
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,509
Darwin's Theory...

40
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,157
...is always assumed to mean that
the strong are always right.

41
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,717
But the fittest were never the strongest
nor even the cleverest...

42
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,037
The fittest
- Mum, can you do it later?

43
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,390
...are the ones best adapted...

44
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,319
They're often the least conspicuous.

45
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,071
The grey mouse...
Who survived under Stalin?

46
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,117
The colourless concièrge.

47
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,632
Who survived prehistory?
Not the dinosaurs, they died out.

48
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,234
Bye, Dad.

49
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,998
You heard what I said?

50
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,351
Yes, we're descended
from mice, not apes.

51
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,792
Can the professor see me now?
- Come on in.

52
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,115
Thank you.

53
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,797
My name's Verkuil.
- Are you one of my students?

54
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,230
No, I'm a film conservator.

55
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,558
I have a few questions for the professor.

56
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,354
Oh, you're Professor Boerhave?

57
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,718
Lecturer, not professor.
- Never mind.

58
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,719
Your name was on the list.

59
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,310
Can this room be blacked out?

60
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,353
It's a pre-war house, so I expect so.

61
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,028
What I have to show you is also
pre-war.

62
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,914
My name's on a list?
- Invitees to the première.

63
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,073
He wants a black out.

64
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,749
No, the room!

65
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,431
The General's off the wall.

66
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,199
Wait a second!

67
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,388
I'm reconstructing
a Polish avant-garde film from 1 937.

68
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,156
Only two lines of dialogue.

69
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,228
That's enough for a dialogue.
- You do speak Polish?

70
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,795
I understand it. That's not the same.

71
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,549
One of them is the key
to reconstructing the film.

72
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,432
The question is which?

73
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,595
One more time.
Emit erom eno.

74
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,949
I beg your pardon?

75
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,232
I spoke Backwards.
Sdrawkcab ekops I.

76
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,113
It all sounds like Frisian or Russian.

77
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,517
You want to hear it again?
- Please. Esaelp.

78
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,911
The sky won't fall on you
if you walk backwards.

79
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,957
No, the French ''reculer''
is more accurate:

80
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,550
The sky won't fall on you
if you walk ass first.

81
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,997
Oh Vera, sorry.

82
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,915
No.

83
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,155
The man took me by surprise.

84
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,915
I understand. I understand.

85
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,476
It's nothing.

86
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,439
A dog in the garden.

87
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,430
Tuttel, you should stay out
of seawater! Dirty doggy!

88
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,560
Who led you astray?

89
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,874
What's the meaning of driving
my dog crazy like this?

90
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,477
Throw that thing back in the sea.

91
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,793
What's that for?

92
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,958
I threw a crab on your book.
- But why?

93
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,232
I thought you might think it
nice, scary or cool...

94
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,795
I wanted to see what you'd do.

95
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,391
I probably would have liked it
if it wasn't a borrowed book.

96
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,713
But I wouldn't have thought it scary.

97
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,480
A dead person stinks more
than a dead crab.

98
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,070
I hear they really stink,
have you ever smelled one?

99
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,236
No, never had the chance.

100
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,831
Even though my own father's dead.
- And you couldn't sniff him?

101
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,795
I think my mother might have let me
but I hadn't been born yet.

102
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,116
My father has no legs.

103
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,869
Oh that's you, is it?
That can be really boring.

104
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,268
Would you rather be dead
or have no legs?

105
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,952
Your father isn't a soccer player, is he?
- No.

106
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,513
So what's the problem?

107
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,996
My heart's on the right side.
- Mine too.

108
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,317
No. it can't be. It's on the left.

109
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,829
Mine is, listen.

110
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,113
I can't hear anything.

111
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,871
That's because it's a very small heart.
Very small and on the right.

112
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,989
Mrs Koenen?

113
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,675
Victoria?

114
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,632
Victoria, it's me: Vera.

115
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,795
Hello?

116
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,118
I told you! It's Vera.

117
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,109
Anne.

118
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,356
I just spoke to your mother.

119
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,597
What happened to her?
- A clot on the brain.

120
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,268
Oh, how awful.
- Indeed.

121
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,028
Do you remember Marjolein?

122
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,077
No, I don't think so.
- I was Bernard's secretary.

123
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,874
You saw her at the funeral.

124
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,868
Was your husband the man we read
about who died in an attack?

125
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,433
Tim didn't die.

126
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,269
Oh but someone did die?
- Not my husband.

127
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,029
Mother wants to go.
She's always tired after confession.

128
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,273
You live here?
- For 2 years, you didn't know?

129
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,509
Come round for coffee some time.
- Great.

130
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,675
Bye.

131
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,835
Looking for me?

132
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,873
No, sorry.

133
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
I want an answer to a mystery.

134
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,715
You know the church is to show mysteries
and not to solve them.

135
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,270
Isn't there a confessional here?

136
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,153
You want to confess?
- No thanks.

137
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,713
It's just...

138
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,469
...how does someone confess
if they can't talk?

139
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,956
I can't tell you.
- Confessional secret?

140
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,918
You could use notes.
- Did you find any?

141
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,315
No, so you use notes.

142
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,715
Are you Catholic?
- No, just curious.

143
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,717
Is that a sin?
- No.

144
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,797
Show me your mysteries.

145
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,629
You'll find them in the chapel of
the Madonna of Czestochowa.

146
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,075
Here you are.
- Thank you.

147
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,709
You want some?

148
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,433
Mr Manfred.
- Mrs Gravesande.

149
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,471
Un blanc.
- One moment.

150
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,950
Your husband is lunching in his room?

151
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,834
You said?

152
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,157
I understand him hiding himself away.

153
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,554
For security reasons.

154
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,991
They might come back any time.
I don't sleep a wink.

155
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,033
They won't come back for you.
- No.

156
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,835
But I'm in the room next-door...
to your husband.

157
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,555
Mum, can I leave the table?
- Yes, dear, go on.

158
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,077
I hear him scuttling round at night.

159
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,070
He has good reason to worry whether
he taught his students the right things.

160
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,796
My husband teaches his students
philosophy, not making bombs.

161
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,594
I didn't say that.

162
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,318
They learn complex things at university.
The simple ones are often forgotten.

163
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,114
Good manners... decency.

164
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,436
There are things you don't do.

165
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,315
Like sending mail bombs.
- Yes, madam.

166
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,110
She says it's Dad own fault.
- She's just incredibly dumb.

167
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,393
She says the culprits will come back.
- She's talking rubbish.

168
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,558
It's possible. What if they send a bomb?

169
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,159
It was pure chance?

170
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,189
You father didn't do anything, did he?

171
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,068
I don't know.

172
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,035
Sometimes you read that stuffy fathers
are spies or murderers.

173
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,151
Our family is really stuffy.

174
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,272
My brother's a murderer.
- What did you say?

175
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,916
He's the king of an
African country, of Bunyoro.

176
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,155
Bunyoro?

177
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,114
To be king there,
you have to kill all your brothers.

178
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,278
And his father is your father?
Does your mother know?

179
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,311
She told me herself.

180
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,593
Aren't you afraid?
Of a package from Africa one day?

181
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,109
No, he won't send a bomb by post.

182
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,518
Maybe a royal strangler,
or a poisonous snake or a curse.

183
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,631
Yes, they're really dangerous.

184
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,594
He sticks a nail in a doll
and you feel it in your heart.

185
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,792
Oh sorry, your heart's wrong anyway.
- Never mind.

186
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,275
Have you ever had a French kiss?

187
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,948
No, but I know how to do it.

188
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,109
I put my tongue in your mouth
so there's no room for yours...

189
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,515
...and so you stick it my mouth.

190
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,151
And you have to hold your head askew,
or your nose gets in the way.

191
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,434
Tim.

192
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,594
I almost knew.
- What did you almost know?

193
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,872
Your dinner was outside the door.
- I'm not hungry.

194
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,038
Have something to eat.
Here you are.

195
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,669
You want your other leg too?

196
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,509
No, I'll take this one off.
I practiced enough for today.

197
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,189
Poodle.

198
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,310
I saw Victoria.
She was in a wheelchair.

199
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,670
Victoria?
- Victoria Koenen.

200
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,916
Your first girlfriend's mother.

201
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,910
A coincidence. She was your
best friend, you were taken.

202
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,238
That's not the point? I'm trying to say
someone we know has a stroke.

203
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,752
I fancied you but you fancied Bernard,
so I dated your girlfriend Anne.

204
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,633
You keep on, don't you?
You never change.

205
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,193
What do you want me to say?

206
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,075
Victoria Koenen in a wheelchair!
Great, so I'm not the only one.

207
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,636
Anyway, Victoria always had a poodle.

208
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,833
She had more than one.
What did Victoria say?

209
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,190
Nothing. She can't talk any more.

210
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,154
And she doesn't have the poodle.
- That's why.

211
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,033
Are you all right?
- Sure.

212
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,155
Right...

213
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,838
Bunyoro African neighbours.

214
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,028
Where you borrowed the paper from.
- Yes.

215
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,110
And the paperboy Emma mentioned?
- Oh, Emma is kissing a boy downstairs.

216
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,873
Not the paperboy?
- No, not the paperboy.

217
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,833
What did he say to Emma.
Oh yes.

218
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,430
He said he was related to
the king of Bunyoro.

219
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,430
A half brother.
- Emma has a black boyfriend?

220
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,438
I didn't say that.
- No black boyfriend?

221
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,996
You should go outside.

222
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,512
With all those shorts around? No way.
I can solve this without leaving my room.

223
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,039
I have everything I need here.

224
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,233
You'll have to come out sometime.
You could go the other way, Tim.

225
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,069
Away from the beach and bare knees.
- Why should I want to?

226
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,032
Why you should want to?

227
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,358
I saw Victoria come out of a church,
I went inside...

228
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,193
...and in the church was a painting
of your accident painted.

229
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,310
No!
- Yes.

230
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,798
Everything, the dog, the explosion...
- You're making it up.

231
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,115
I am?

232
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,351
I know what I know.
Anyway...

233
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,834
Here you are.

234
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,069
Eat.

235
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,755
Be careful.

236
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,754
Looking for something special?
Apples are on offer.

237
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,955
I wanted to buy this paper,
but don't have any money with me.

238
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,990
Professor Boerhave, I presume?

239
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,790
My name is Van Spijk.
You can keep the paper.

240
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,392
Your photo was on all the front pages,
even abroad.

241
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,876
It was sold out everyday.
- Thank you.

242
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,629
Any news?

243
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,715
I mean about the attack.
- I only know what was in the paper.

244
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,833
It's not a poodle, it's
a Portuguese water dog.

245
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,676
The ancestor of the poodle.

246
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,593
It's criminal to use them
for kamikaze attacks.

247
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,472
Did no one claim responsibility
for the attack?

248
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,831
Not that I know.
- Surely that's not logical?

249
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,512
If an attack fails, claim it, or people won't
know what you want to achieve.

250
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,393
Maybe it didn't fail.
- You think so?

251
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,990
So it comes down to that visitor Verkuil?

252
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,952
What film did he show you?

253
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,276
I don't remember anything about it.

254
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,153
If you hold your dog, I can go outside.

255
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,033
Carlos, in your basket.

256
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,595
Very good.

257
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,956
Carlos saved my life once.

258
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,357
I had my foot caught in a fishing net.

259
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,917
Well, that won't happen to me!
- What won't happen to you?

260
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,708
Nice bike.

261
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,672
It doesn't sound very healthy?
- Spare parts are always a problem.

262
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,475
Which year?
- The year of my birth.

263
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,076
Russian. Dnepr. Rpend... Repent...

264
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,510
Did you have a motorbike?
- Yes, a Harley.

265
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,757
From my birth-year too.
No thanks, I stopped.

266
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,315
Don't lead me into temptation.

267
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,956
You said Rpend?
- Dnepr spoken backwards.

268
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,355
You're not a Catholic.
- No.

269
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,710
I'm a logical positivist.

270
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,754
I heard of that. You said Logical...?
- ...Positivist.

271
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,712
That sounds positive!
- Yes.

272
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,432
You mean in a Christian sense?
- No, on the contrary.

273
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,555
It investigates whether one
can sensibly discuss if God exists.

274
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,595
You do believe in
the immortality of the soul?

275
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,394
In a certain sense.

276
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,994
You could say my soul
survived the death of my legs.

277
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,749
Sometimes I feel my legs, phantom pain.

278
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,234
Ah, a beautiful image...

279
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,434
A dead person lives on
as phantom pain in the relatives.

280
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,312
I know my legs are gone.

281
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,514
They found the bits and
dissected them in the laboratory...

282
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,439
...looking for splinters, chemical traces.

283
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,713
...samples were sent to other labs
in Japan, Germany, the USA...

284
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,311
...to compare them with remains
of other victims.

285
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,629
There may be 1 000 bits of Boerhave
scattered around the world like holy relics.

286
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,115
Logical Positivist, you said?

287
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,595
Only the thinking part
of Tim Boerhave.

288
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,829
Cogito ergo sum.

289
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,519
Touché. Indeed.

290
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,349
I heard you have
an interesting collection here.

291
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,118
Not relics, but we have a collection
of unrecognised miracles.

292
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,390
I would love to see them.

293
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,389
Christ almighty!

294
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,278
Sir? What's the matter?

295
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,753
Can I help you?

296
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,669
I have pain in my legs, but it will pass.

297
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,235
What do you want with that painting?

298
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,193
I wanted to take it, steal it.
But the paint's still wet.

299
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,277
Why d'you want to steal it?

300
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,949
I shouldn't be hanging there.
I wasn't saved.

301
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,549
You're still alive, aren't you?

302
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,270
I wondered who the artist was.

303
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,278
I'll show you.

304
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,036
Look, this is him: Jona.

305
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,800
Here he painted his own ex voto.

306
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,228
That whale.

307
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,313
I saw it this morning
in Van Spijk's store.

308
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,798
May I?
- Yes.

309
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,632
He also painted
an ex-voto for me.

310
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,833
You have cramp again?

311
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,519
No, it's all right.

312
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,515
Look.

313
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,991
I see a house with a hand.
- That's my house.

314
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,269
And that hand?

315
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,319
That was my profession.

316
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,595
Manicure?

317
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,632
No chiromancy.
I used to read palms.

318
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,196
You predict the future?
I should have met you before.

319
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,315
No, not the future. People have
a question and a secret wish.

320
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,229
They ask the question and
I have to guess the wish.

321
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,035
Who's the man with the revolver?

322
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,917
That's the father of my child.

323
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,676
Was he saved by a miracle?
- No. he's dead. He was already old.

324
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,596
The miracle is that he fathered a baby.

325
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,951
Poodle, possibly water dog.

326
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,152
Victoria had a poodle
or was it a water dog?

327
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,715
Painting of the big bang.

328
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,751
Painter: Jona.

329
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,635
Who ordered it?
The priest should know.

330
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,274
With his Dnepr. Repent.

331
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,593
The miracle.

332
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,995
Tim?!

333
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,109
Come in, Vera.

334
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,919
Are you going out?
- Yes.

335
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,072
Are you coming?
- No.

336
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,559
Oh, come on.

337
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,592
What did you do today?

338
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,758
You were right about leaving my room.
- Of course I was.

339
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,670
I met a master of a dog
and a servant of God.

340
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,791
And dog is god backwards.

341
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,309
I get it, you went to the church.

342
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,548
I shouldn't hang there. I wasn't saved.
- I don't know why the painting's there.

343
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,754
A woman in the church thought
I should hang there as a miracle.

344
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,918
Who was she?
- ''You're alive, aren't you?''

345
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,949
Yes, what else did she say?

346
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,312
A miracle happened.

347
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,999
How shall I explain it.

348
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,677
No...?
- Yes.

349
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,154
In the church?

350
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,632
Yes.
- No.

351
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,549
What's the matter?

352
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,154
What's up?

353
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,388
What are you doing?
- Go on downstairs.

354
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,395
Why?

355
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,635
Go on.

356
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,879
Will you come too?

357
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,230
Go downstairs.
- I asked you to come too.

358
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,554
I can imagine you bumping
into someone here...

359
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,116
...like a handsome man with two legs.

360
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,756
Is that what you want?
- In a manner of speaking.

361
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,391
If you weren't crippled,
I'd knock you off the bed.

362
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,591
I mean it!
- Yes, I mean it too!

363
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,752
If you go on like that,
I'll do something to you.

364
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,998
Yes, I really will.

365
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,671
You think I can practice my profession?
- Not if you act so stupid.

366
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,428
Tango!

367
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,274
1 , 2.

368
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,594
Jesus Christ!
- Holy Mary.

369
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,710
You're my salvation.

370
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,275
No, you saved me.

371
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,712
If you hadn't turned up, then
- Then you'd be lying in the water.

372
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,390
But if you hadn't braked in time,
there'd be two victims.

373
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,953
You could look at it that way.

374
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,196
Your salvation has a name.

375
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,159
My name is Prudence.

376
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,235
I'm Tim.

377
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,109
Prudentia, Temperatia, Justitia.

378
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,995
Fortitu...! Jesus.

379
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,269
Looking for me?

380
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,635
I almost dived after you.

381
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,637
People have a question
and a secret wish, you said?

382
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,879
They pose the question and
I can guess the wish.

383
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,198
My first question after the explosion was:
do I still exist?

384
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,428
Or is there anything left of Tim Boerhave
to pose that question?

385
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,993
You know the answer.

386
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,992
The certainty of Descartes:
I think therefore I am.

387
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,393
And the next?

388
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,512
That's from Darwin:
Can I still reproduce?

389
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,952
That's a ridiculous question.
Why should I want to?

390
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,709
Without the bomb,
I'd never have even thought of that.

391
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,273
And the third question?

392
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,353
Is there a third question?

393
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,435
Yes.

394
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,115
Can I look at other people's legs
without emotion?

395
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,433
No, I can't.

396
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,438
Other people's legs make me angry,
jealous...

397
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,675
...they excite me...

398
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,716
...they confuse me.

399
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,870
Then you know you exist, don't you?

400
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,117
According to Descartes.

401
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,355
Darwin.

402
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,548
Prudence.

403
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,194
Oh darling, I have to dry myself.

404
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,712
Really?
- Yes.

405
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,555
I'm going to see Anne and Marjolein.
D'you feel like coming?

406
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,392
No. Did Dad go out with Anne?
- Oh, but that's a long time ago.

407
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,957
She's terrible.
She keeps interrogating you.

408
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,436
I'm going. See you later.
- Bye.

409
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,515
Tuttel...

410
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,796
Tuttel, come here!

411
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,838
Victoria, was it your dog
that blew itself up?

412
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,109
Your Diamond?

413
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,515
Anne!

414
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,835
Anne!

415
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,875
Vera!?

416
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,353
You're not leaving, are you?
- I'm not interrupting?

417
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,348
No. Didn't you bring Tim?
- No, I have flowers for you.

418
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,989
Here you are.

419
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,437
What a lovely garden you have.
- Thank you.

420
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,670
What lovely photos.
- Yes.

421
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,189
Weren't we young?
- Yes.

422
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,549
Funny idea. If you'd stayed with Bernard,
you would now be a widow.

423
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,916
And I'd have a legless husband.

424
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,032
Funny?
- No, not funny.

425
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,515
More a strange coincidence.

426
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,437
How's Vicky? I heard she was
working in tropical agriculture?

427
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,679
I don't know. She's somewhere
in the African bush, saving apes.

428
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,871
Don't you write?
- No.

429
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,757
The umbilical cord's been cut.
She didn't like my new marriage.

430
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,030
Marriage?
- Yes, to Marjolein.

431
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,032
I'd said such terrible things about her
when she was Bernard's lover.

432
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,074
Terrible things about me?
- I didn't know the worst yet.

433
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,318
Isn't Victoria here?
- She's gone to church.

434
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,950
What exactly happened to her?

435
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,757
She called that the dog had gone.
Vicky'd gone. ''Come and fetch me.''

436
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,119
We drove over, she sat on the stairs
and couldn't talk.

437
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,879
Did Vicky live with Victoria?
- Yes, didn't you know?

438
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,070
Thanks.

439
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,840
I think you're telepathic, Vera.

440
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,514
Why?
- I wanted to ask you a question...

441
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,517
...and you blushed before I spoke.

442
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,631
I know what she'll ask.
- Don't.

443
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,638
If Captain Cassanova's
tried to seduce you.

444
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,835
Captain Cassanova?
- Van Spijk.

445
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,032
You danced with him all night..
- That's right.

446
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,719
I danced with him.

447
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,469
Van Spijk seduces
all the female tourists in his shop.

448
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,830
I haven't been in his shop.

449
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,194
If his shop door's locked,
you know he has a woman in his bedroom.

450
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,076
That's right, isn't it Marjolein?
- A different one each time, Anne?

451
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,235
Thank you.

452
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,470
Delicious marmalade.
- From Van Spijk's shop.

453
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,716
Can you shop there
without being seduced?

454
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,556
Tim loves marmalade.
- Oh, I'm so happy to hear that.

455
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,156
That vital functions carry on.
- Sex.

456
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,237
Sorry?
- Keep out of it, Mar.

457
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,637
Sex. And not the missionary position.
- What d'you mean?

458
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,718
See? She doesn't know.
- Marjolein means...

459
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,710
She may say it obscurely.
Tim's new form poses new demands.

460
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,471
The classic way of making love
may not be the most functional.

461
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,789
I really don't want
to talk to you about this.

462
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,313
You can trust us. We're your friends.

463
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,080
It's hopeless, Anne.
- Keep out of it.

464
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,350
She doesn't think we should.
- Do what?

465
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,916
I told you.
- Tackle Tim with our expertise.

466
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,671
No. She'd rather he wanked
on the beach between the bodies.

467
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,269
It was lovely. Thanks for the tea.

468
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,555
Hi Dad.

469
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,710
Can I have some money for an ice cream?

470
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,998
How many is that?
- My first today.

471
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,309
Where's Mum?

472
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,751
With that awful Anne,
were you really in love with her?

473
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,870
Well...

474
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,039
You know, Dad?

475
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,879
Jan's mother reads palms,
she can see how long you'll live.

476
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,433
And if you're in love.

477
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,349
Has she looked at your hand?
- No way!

478
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,709
Afraid she'll see something?

479
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,434
No, Jan's in love, not me.

480
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,229
Thanks.

481
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,599
Yes, sir?

482
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,393
I was talking to myself.

483
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,592
What are you reading?

484
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,478
I nearly finished it.

485
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,276
They're detective stories about a priest.

486
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,440
I'd like to borrow it when you finish.

487
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,428
I started it once,
but lost it halfway through.

488
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,995
The bomb.

489
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,393
You can buy it from me later.
- I can what?

490
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,359
Buy the book when I finish it.

491
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,279
Don't hurry for me.

492
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,193
I won't charge for the pages
you already read.

493
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,908
That's nice of you.

494
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,155
What page was it?
It was about leaves...

495
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,116
Where would you hide a leaf?

496
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,073
That was in
The Sign of the Broken Sword.

497
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,634
Where would a wise man hide a leaf?

498
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,798
And the other answered.
- In the forest.

499
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,871
You were more than halfway.

500
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,317
Let me see, that'll be...

501
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,792
...2.58 euro.

502
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,633
That was quick.

503
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,036
You want to know how?
- Yes. No, never mind.

504
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,714
2.58 euro. You have change from ten?

505
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,069
Yes, I'll change it in there.

506
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,876
Can I offer you a drink?

507
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,359
Orange juice please.

508
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,239
Why no vodka?

509
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,871
My father always ordered that,
my mother says.

510
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,075
Time for your aperitif, professor?

511
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,158
Jan is getting me a drink.

512
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,592
I wouldn't count on it.
I saw him walking off with your daughter.

513
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,951
You want a drink, Prudence?

514
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,031
Oh, yes please.

515
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,153
White wine please.

516
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,594
A white wine and vodka ice.
- Vodka ice...

517
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,753
Jan said his father always drank that.

518
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,188
Yes...

519
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,716
The mythology of the father.

520
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,472
You had to make up much?

521
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,912
Jan always wanted to know everything.

522
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,153
He asked things about his father
that I never wondered.

523
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,796
I saw his photo in the paper.

524
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,639
It was in all the papers when he died.

525
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,750
When he died?

526
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,917
The general was famous.

527
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,549
I didn't know that.
When he came to me, I saw...

528
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,551
...a nice, courteous desperate old man...

529
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,149
...with an impossible question.

530
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,919
Could you help him?

531
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,272
He said he was on his way
to the airport...

532
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,115
...with a gun...

533
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,076
...and money for a ticket...

534
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,554
...and a mission.

535
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,433
At the airport, he'd forgotten.

536
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,474
Forgotten what?
- Why he was there.

537
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,069
He didn't know his destination.

538
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,513
Then he drove back. Not back home
but the other way, to the coast.

539
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,472
Then he saw my sign and
got out for a consultation.

540
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,918
He never left again.

541
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,712
Thanks.

542
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,749
Here's to you.

543
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,793
To the future.

544
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,075
To you.

545
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,599
Not to the future?

546
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,717
I'll drink to you.

547
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,238
If I show you my hand...

548
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,999
...am I an open book?

549
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,234
Yes...

550
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,798
You didn't even look. Go on.
What can you see?

551
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,514
A hand.

552
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,794
Prudence!

553
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,835
What did you see?

554
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,118
Something with water.

555
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,593
Look, my father.

556
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,999
And this is the king.

557
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,039
He only drinks milk.

558
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,635
Milk is filthy, yugh!

559
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,872
These are his ministers.

560
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,878
Is that your half-brother
who wants to kill you?

561
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,752
No, he wasn't born yet.

562
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,273
Look, the king has a mask
and a beard like my father.

563
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,475
Shut your eyes.

564
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,509
You can look.

565
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,233
Wow what a great thing.

566
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,954
It's really itchy.
- Don't take it off.

567
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,113
Now dance a real jungle dance.

568
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,909
Not too tight?

569
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,075
How can I make love to my husband?

570
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,949
Hello?

571
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,154
What are you doing?

572
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,189
I jumped out of bed
but forgot that I have no...

573
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,115
They hung up.

574
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,278
How was your tea party?

575
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,391
I don't want to talk about it. It was awful.

576
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,948
Awful?

577
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,637
Awful and I don't want to talk.
- So you stole something...

578
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,668
Vicky, Victoria and Diamond.

579
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,072
What're you doing?
- Looking at what you stole.

580
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,233
I didn't steal anything.
- That photo.

581
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,152
Oh yes. But I stole the photo
before I found out it was awful.

582
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,112
I saw Victoria in the church
with the priest.

583
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,590
That's normal,
but the painter was there too.

584
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,837
I think Victoria had that painting made.

585
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,839
You recognise the dog?

586
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,679
It looks like the one.

587
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,714
And like the dog in Van Spijk's store.

588
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,952
How can we find out?

589
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,109
DNA

590
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,758
Victoria's clothes are covered
with dog, with Diamond.

591
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,634
Yes and Vicky lived with Victoria
as a student.

592
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,148
There's someone else on the photo.

593
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,278
The photographer's shadow
or a passer-by.

594
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,472
No, no look.

595
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:12,392
Look at Vicky's gaze.
She's in love and Victoria...

596
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,670
...she doesn't like it a bit.

597
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,440
Victoria knows who took the photo.

598
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,593
And Vicky?
- Yes, Vicky too of course.

599
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,791
She's in Africa saving apes.

600
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,313
Something else...

601
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,999
I remember that.

602
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,874
Portugal... grilled fish.

603
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,832
The smoke got in my eyes.

604
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,917
Yes, but take a good look.

605
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,277
Bernard was still alive.

606
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,193
No, that girl.

607
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,195
Yes, it's Vicky.

608
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,749
Doesn't she look like Emma?

609
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,197
No, I can't see. It must be the age.

610
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:53,114
Tim, are we sure that
Bernard is Vicky's father?

611
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,995
Calculated: birthday minus gestation.

612
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,159
No DNA test?
- There was no such thing then.

613
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,312
And Bernard recognised it,
let's have dinner.

614
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,155
What, you want dinner?

615
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,638
Yes, I'm hungry and they have wolf fish.

616
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,548
You're going downstairs?
- Yes.

617
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,714
Professor.

618
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:22,909
Is high water at ten tonight?
- I don't know, but I'll check.

619
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,272
What are you planning?

620
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,758
Shall I test you?

621
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,032
No, you can't test,
you only give lectures.

622
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,073
Emma be nice to Dad, he meant well.

623
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,192
But if he tests me,
I don't understand a word.

624
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,475
What can I get from the buffet?
- Don't eat too much.

625
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,871
He'll get too fat.
Let's get some dessert.

626
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,759
There's the dessert.
- You have enough?

627
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,394
Have some potatoes.
- I'm full.

628
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,429
Hi Tim.

629
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:07,191
Are you going swimming tonight?
- I came to ask you that. Hi Jan.

630
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,039
Can I come too?

631
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,715
You know you can't go in the water.

632
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,071
Yes, but what if...

633
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,035
What if I fall in the water?
I won't know what to do.

634
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,396
You know what I think, professor?

635
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,713
Mrs Gravesande.

636
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:29,994
I don't know what you think,
but I can try to guess.

637
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,873
Maybe you want to give me
a piece of your mind?

638
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,355
I think they know who did it.

639
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,632
I don't know about that.
- No, you know why?

640
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,115
What do you think?

641
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,308
You were punished for
committing a terrible crime.

642
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,351
They're investigating that.

643
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,279
What crime?
- You should know that.

644
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:56,194
They told me it was a mistake, chance.
- There's no such thing, professor.

645
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,799
God doesn't play dice.

646
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,639
You were punished by
the Old Testament God.

647
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,469
An eye for an eye,
a hand, a tooth, a foot...

648
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,356
You can't say that, Mrs Gravesande.
- Yes I can, it's the Bible.

649
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,315
But if I didn't take someone's legs,
then I'm owed two.

650
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,312
And who's going to cough up?

651
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,715
You, Mrs Gravesande?!

652
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,752
You're pretty, Mum.
- Don't talk rubbish.

653
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,279
No, I mean it.

654
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,874
Are you going out?
- No, not really.

655
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,117
Just pretending.
What are you going to do?

656
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,914
Maybe that stupid assignment.

657
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,232
Very good. Survival of the fittest.

658
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,277
CLOSED

659
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,914
You locked the door?
- Yes.

660
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,270
Shouldn't I let that girl in?
- No.

661
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,719
No, she's my daughter.

662
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,038
She doesn't need anything.

663
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,477
You have a big daughter.

664
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,713
Sure, but she's still a little girl for me.

665
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,794
I made coffee, you want some?
- Please.

666
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,630
With milk?
- Yes.

667
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,479
Sugar, dash of brandy?
- Delicious, both.

668
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:43,434
Sometimes your shop's shut. Then I hear
you have a lady in your bedroom.

669
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,033
You shouldn't believe all people say.

670
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,389
But is it true?

671
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,999
Not always.

672
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,989
Now the shop's shut, but
there's no lady in my bedroom.

673
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,038
How very convenient.

674
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,714
Good.

675
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,995
Your order, Tim.

676
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,149
Orange juice, after all?
- It's too early for vodka.

677
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,472
I took one yesterday.

678
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,678
Why did you disappear?

679
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,108
Yes...

680
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,598
I wanted to tell you something,
but had to tell Emma first.

681
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,916
You still want to tell me?

682
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,033
Yes. I told her I was in love with her.

683
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,231
Great. What did she say?

684
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,272
I wrote it down for her.

685
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,994
In a poem?

686
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,912
I'm not a poet.

687
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,477
I worked out the shortest distance
in the universe.

688
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,671
I know what the shortest time is too.

689
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:39,080
I called the smallest space unit Emma
and the smallest time unit Jan.

690
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,437
She must have liked that!

691
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,477
I haven't let her read it yet.

692
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,909
Why not?

693
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,992
I thought it was too difficult
and she has to resit Darwin.

694
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,155
Oh God, yes.

695
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,988
Do you see anything in Darwin, Tim?

696
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:04,719
Imagine if everyone exploded
when your bomb did.

697
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,310
Imagine the whole world population
legless at once.

698
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,351
Would that be a comfort?

699
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,149
Comfort? No. I stand on exclusivity.

700
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,551
But it's an interesting thought.

701
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,799
The question is: when you enlarge
the scale of a problem...

702
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,230
...if the problem is the same?
- Yes.

703
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,234
Whether the bomb was for
someone else is then solved.

704
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,316
Or not.

705
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,274
Whether they wanted me
or someone else is pointless.

706
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,996
No. Maybe the culprits did want
to get one person.

707
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,829
What about the rest of the world?

708
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:45,396
They were to stop you
guessing who the one was.

709
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,628
There's another possibility.
- What?

710
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,755
Someone wanted to take your legs,
not kill you.

711
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:59,715
Why in the name of God?
- Yes, that's the question.

712
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,957
I could study physics to find out if
the smallest particles really exist.

713
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,435
You're going to study physics!

714
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,553
But what you discover depends
on your brain structure.

715
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,115
Don't make it too complicated.

716
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,790
I don't think I can
cut someone open to look inside.

717
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,955
Why not?

718
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,433
Everyone is disgusting under his skin.

719
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,200
All that blood, entrails and glands.

720
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,999
All those rampant cells.

721
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,308
Maybe you should study philosophy.

722
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,517
First a swim!

723
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,028
Should you?

724
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:46,836
Emma doesn't like reading,
studying or thinking.

725
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,393
How can she love me?

726
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,153
That's chemistry!

727
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,151
Will you give this to Emma?

728
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,913
Why don't you?

729
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,838
You can read it too.

730
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,350
Euclid was an ass.

731
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,150
You wrote that for Emma?
About how the world works.

732
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,631
Wait, if you talk to Emma about me
being in love with her...

733
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,992
...don't say I think everyone is dirty
under the skin.

734
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,910
Jan, you can't go swimming!

735
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,275
Jan!

736
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,195
Jan, you can't go swimming!

737
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,589
Tim, why don't you come inside?

738
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,479
Where have you been?

739
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,752
I bought some marmalade.

740
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,479
I want to come in.

741
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,433
Well, that's alright.

742
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:51,396
Christ, Tim, how did you
get the chair this far?

743
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,670
I couldn't save him, Vera.

744
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,394
No, but others were on the beach.

745
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,114
I was the only one who knew
and saw it happen.

746
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,114
If I had legs...
- You could have saved him.

747
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,077
I think I need to get someone to help.

748
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:14,592
If I'm guilty and somehow
deserve this punishment...

749
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,598
Because you couldn't save the boy?
- Yes.

750
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,759
But you believe in cause and effect.
- It tallies with your logic.

751
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,712
Punishment precedes sin.

752
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,037
Shall I fetch someone?
- No, wait a while.

753
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,955
Tim...

754
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,154
Would it help if the culprit was found?

755
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,715
Restoration of cause and effect.

756
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,080
You think they're hunting Vicky?

757
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,511
I hope she rescues
lots of apes, our ancestors.

758
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,109
You don't hope she's arrested?

759
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:55,315
What if they find evidence with
traces of culprit and victim?

760
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,318
A DNA test is needed
and they have me.

761
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,718
Are you afraid you're the father,
despite the arithmetic?

762
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:03,796
I dreamt it.

763
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:09,271
I'll go and fetch someone. Okay?

764
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,508
Won't be long.

765
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,348
You saw something in my hand.
- It was impossible.

766
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,919
That's what you said.

767
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,148
What did you see?

768
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,796
It's impossible,
because the hand is a pretext.

769
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,197
They're only lines in the skin.

770
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:02,351
I talk and if someone reacts, I carry on.

771
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,472
Why shouldn't I react?

772
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,998
That's a trade secret.

773
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:13,157
The contact is under the table,
with the knees.

774
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:19,348
You don't have any knees.
- I have phantom knees.

775
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,672
The nerves are exposed.

776
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,715
You should get signals that are
1 00 times stronger from my knees.

777
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,918
What did you see, Prudence?

778
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,429
Jan knew his brother had found him.

779
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,839
You think so?

780
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,635
He tried to flee to where
his brother wouldn't find him.

781
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:10,954
The water.

782
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,877
But how did he know?

783
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,154
From me.

784
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,429
How did you know?
- I didn't know.

785
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,749
I was sent, as an instrument.

786
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,078
A sign.

787
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,351
You, a sign? How?

788
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,838
A truncated man.

789
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,549
Like cutting off and sending
a finger or ear...

790
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,991
...or a horse's head.

791
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,313
Yes...

792
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,950
Your Polish general wanted
to go back to Africa...

793
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:54,472
...to kill the man threatening
his last son 1 3 years ago.

794
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,037
But Jan wasn't born yet.

795
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:03,112
He couldn't remember his mission,
because the crucial piece was missing.

796
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,992
He still had to meet you.

797
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,839
He never knew I had his son.

798
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,437
Without Jan, I'm as maimed as you, Tim.

799
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,949
Forgive my knees for their signals.

800
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:52,550
I want what your knees ask for too, Tim.

801
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,432
I want your child.

802
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,793
Welcome home.

803
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:35,910
I thought they'd be finished.
- The house is finished.

804
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,792
The garden needs some work.

805
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,911
I don't like this at all.

806
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,349
Come on, let's look inside.

807
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,318
What film is it?

808
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,715
It says Polish avant-garde.

809
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,319
Show me.

810
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,273
Dedicated to our conservator G.R. Verkuil
who died tragically.

811
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,198
Shouldn't we go?

812
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,913
I don't know why he came to see me
for one Polish sentence.

813
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,709
Mum?

814
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,592
Yes dear?

815
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,392
I can't sleep.

816
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,356
Nor can we.

817
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,671
Can I come in there?

818
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,675
What?

819
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,279
Can I come in there?

820
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,239
Come on in.

821
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,793
Come in here.

822
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:12,236
Why did he go alone?

823
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,153
He never wanted to go
in the water with me.

824
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,875
What did you say to him, Dad?

825
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:27,193
He wanted to talk to the father
of the girl he was in love with.

826
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,918
What did you say?

827
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,393
I said:

828
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,880
Why don't you study philosophy?

829
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:47,638
He said: I'll go swimming first.

830
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,953
He could have gone with me,
couldn't he?
