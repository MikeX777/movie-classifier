1
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,873
Tell us,
Smaranda!

2
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,031
It seems like Old Ene
is passing us by,

3
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,315
because sleep didn't come,
although we have tried.

4
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,316
Come on, quickly!

5
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:22,631
You know how to tell stories like
nobody else, fairytales and jokes. ..

6
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,717
l don't believe in fairytales!

7
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,118
Ha, ha,
so that's what you think!

8
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,392
Wait until you hear,
and you'll believe in my fairytale!

9
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,477
- No, I won't!
- Yes, you will!

10
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,358
- No, I won't!
- Shut up, you!

11
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,679
Let's all be quiet and
listen to the story!

12
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,750
They say once upon a time...

13
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,596
- What time?
- Long ago, somewhere, there was a wolf.

14
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,718
- Who was there?
- A wolf.

15
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,839
- And he was scarring everyone..
- What was he doing?

16
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,078
- You'll see!
- He was big and he had some teeth...

17
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,118
- He had some what?
- Teeth!

18
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,234
We like it, tell us more,
tell us what went on!

19
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,997
She's making fun of us,
nothing went on!

20
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,550
- Yes, it did!
- No, it didn't!

21
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,995
- Yes, it did!
- Shut up, you!

22
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,716
Let's all be quiet and
listen to the story!

23
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,399
One day, my grandpa...

24
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,953
What was he like?

25
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,636
Like that. As he was walking
towards his village...

26
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,399
- What was he doing?
- Singing.

27
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,156
l don't know how
that happened...

28
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,517
- What was that?
- Happened.

29
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,234
He met with the wolf himself.

30
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,596
Oh, what happened to him?

31
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,154
The wolf said

32
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,308
stay still, I'm going to
eat you right away! 

33
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,193
Look, I'm staying ,
the old man said,

34
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,629
But, you see, I don't want to be eaten
just like that! 

35
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,069
It's you I'm going to eat! 

36
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,909
You're bragging!
You have no teeth!"

37
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,114
You may think l have no teeth! 
Let's see who I'm talking with! 

38
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,393
The wolf widely opened his mouth,
and showed his teeth to the old man.

39
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,911
Then grandpa slightly threw his hand
Into the wolf's neck, this big!

40
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,758
He got to the poor wolf's tail,

41
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,030
Squeezing it so tight, therefore,

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,314
Just like that, he turned
the wolf inside - out!

43
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,231
My, oh, my, what a
power your grandpa had!

44
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,474
Even with a big fortune,
I don't believe a thing!

45
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,875
Perhaps it's unbelievable,

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,878
It happened long time ago,

47
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,952
Back when the fairytale goddess

48
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,556
Appeared, doing wonders.

49
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,918
It happened long time ago,

50
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,070
Back when the wolf was deaf,

51
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,829
But now, you must leave me alone,

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,958
It's time to go to bed!

53
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,110
A fairytale goddess is what
I'd like to see someday,

54
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,998
A fairytale goddess,
to see her coming in my way!

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,520
Never mind,
just listen to her,

56
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,153
I still don't believe a word!

57
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,278
Let's just all go to bed!

58
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,997
Ha, ha, look at her,
She could even sleep up on her feet!

59
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,508
There were also other times,

60
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,949
- I must tell you that.
- Tell us!

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,629
When grandpa was a child,
Little like you, even more,

62
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,831
How thin he was those days!
And he was handsome too!

63
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,555
He listened to the older ones,
Being respectful too,

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,917
And because he was so happy,
He would always run away.

65
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,557
So it was that one sweet day,
The dandelion- fairy came,

66
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,990
With the bag of wonders!
With one look she charmed me,

67
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,079
And laying her hand on him,
She put a spell that he would always win.

68
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,553
Yeah, yeah!

69
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,834
He seemed like he was dreaming,
looking at her amazed.

70
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,750
- A brave bag, I've never heard such thing!
- Shut up, you!

71
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,354
A story is a story, believe it or not,
We'll take it as you told us...

72
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,392
But what about the wolf?

73
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,116
He was left like that,
with the inside out.

74
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,074
But he kept on running, screaming,
and then running,

75
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,757
Then he would rest a while,
screaming like a child...

76
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,875
Hey!

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,958
A noise in the house,
what could it be?

78
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,790
A man from outside,
or a ghost, maybe?

79
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,670
At night, it is normal
to be very quiet!

80
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,118
I must see what happened,
and why is there light?

81
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,116
Ah, what's going on here?

82
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,918
Up-stairs and not
a word spoken!

83
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,155
Up!

84
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,639
What is it?

85
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,872
Why isn't everyone
sleeping at this hour?

86
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,354
Why, why, why?

87
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,198
Why isn't the window
shut up very well?

88
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,470
Why, why, why?

89
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,273
Why was there a screaming,
just like in the woods?

90
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,396
Why, why, why?

91
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,120
Girl, why do you stay with
your mouth opened wide?

92
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,398
Why, why, why?

93
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,952
Go to bed,
go to bed right away!

94
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,870
Look at me, look at me,
I'm in bed already!

95
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,954
Why do you tell stories
wit animals at night?

96
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,151
Why, why, why?

97
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,033
Why does so much dirt
come out of your duster?

98
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,310
Why, why, why?

99
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,079
Why, is the pillow on your
head when you're near me?

100
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,475
Why, why, why?

101
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,433
I want you to leave this
house right this morning!

102
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,910
Why, why, why?

103
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,559
Everybody, everybody,
go to bed!

104
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,957
Please, please, please,
forgive her!

105
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,478
You have to remember,
tomorrow it's your birthday,

106
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,389
But you weren't nice,
so we won't celebrate you!

107
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,116
Then, would you please,
at least make a cake for me?

108
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,310
It is not your birthday!

109
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,635
But I want it to be now!

110
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,952
Hurray, girls,
today it's my birthday!

111
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,073
Hurray girls, hurry!

112
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,516
Hurray, girls,
today it's my birthday!

113
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,633
So, what, you've been punished list night!
He, he, he!

114
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,678
Good morning, here,
comes the milk!

115
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,279
Who is in charge with the bread?
Good morning!

116
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,152
Good morning!

117
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,479
Excuse me!

118
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,156
A gardener told me this morning,

119
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,270
That, in the house,
among the children,

120
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,869
We might celebrate a birthday?
What we should do?

121
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,390
l have a suggestion to make:
I could even bake a cake.

122
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,635
Even if it isn't big!

123
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,432
You won't bake a thing!

124
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,992
The celebrated child
is Veronica today.

125
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,750
I still won't make
the cake anyway!

126
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,155
- But she has no one in this world!
- To bad!

127
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,952
Poor little girl!

128
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,389
Not even the smallest cake!

129
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,796
What!

130
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,956
No way!

131
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,512
We've all been kids someday,
Little children, just like them.

132
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,753
But when we had our birthdays,
There were no cakes for us those days.

133
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,917
One little mistake we made:
breaking something, broking something...

134
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,350
Our mother had her way
In showing us how to behave!

135
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,516
She was doing the right thing!

136
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,308
For playing, laughing
and singing along,

137
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,271
l don't see the guilt!

138
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,395
I said l won't bake a thing!
Where's the flour, where did I put it?

139
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,757
You're standing rig ht next to it!

140
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,518
Be careful when you're mixing!

141
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,279
I said I won't bake a thing!

142
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,031
We weren't receiving any present.

143
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,433
A present?

144
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,999
An egg, please!

145
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,190
Be careful when you're mixing!

146
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,356
Don't teach me how to do it!

147
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,238
If I hang around my mother
Speaking loudly, she would spank me.

148
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,669
She was doing the right thing!

149
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,032
Add some sugar on the top,
To make it even tastier,

150
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,994
I know how to make it good,
But I don't want to do it!

151
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,752
Besides, a promise is a promise.
I said I won't bake a thing!

152
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,032
All this time you kept bugging me,
And, look what we've got here!

153
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,759
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to you!

154
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,678
Happy Birthday, Veronica,
be always happy as today!

155
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,348
Happy Birthday, Veronica,
we wish you all the joy,

156
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,872
Happy Birthday, Veronica,
we wish you all the luck,

157
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,797
Now blow off the candles,
let's see if you can do that.

158
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,718
lf l were her, I would blow,
And instantly I'd cut the cake!

159
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,390
For how long will she wait?
We want to eat the cake!

160
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,792
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday!

161
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,394
- Blow off, blow off!
- Blow off!

162
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,398
Blow off, off, off!

163
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:01,394
Veronica, Veronica,
you're a brave, good, little girl,

164
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,437
This is why my gift for
you is this pretty little bag!

165
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,552
It is full of good advices,
it is magical, you'll see!

166
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,439
It can teach you lots of things,
only if you'll listen to it!

167
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:29,235
It can belong to anyone, to him,
to you, but only if one day,

168
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,354
You'll all be able to say:
 I'm hard- working, I'm brave,

169
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,396
and I'm kind. Respectful
and nice, I can be anytime! 

170
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,318
It is full of good advices,
and in any circumstance,

171
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,114
It can teach you lots of things,
only if you'll listen to it!

172
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,999
It's a present you can
get only on a special day

173
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,237
Because it's a magic bag!
It is yours, Veronica!

174
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,237
It can belong to anyone, to him,
to you, but only if one day,

175
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,830
You'll be able to say:
I'm hard- working, I'm rave,

176
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,274
and I'm kind. Respectful and
nice, I can be anytime! 

177
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,595
It is full of good advices,
and in any circumstance

178
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:56,110
It can teach you lots of things,
only if you'll listen to it!

179
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,716
It's a present you can get
only on a special day,

180
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,078
Because it's a magic bag!
It is yours, Veronica!

181
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,992
Fairy Goddess,
I'm so happy

182
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,910
For this joy that you have brought me!
And I thank you for the present,

183
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,709
I will always listen to it!

184
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,913
- She's gone!
- I know where she went!

185
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,239
No, you don't, she went...
l won't tell where.

186
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,599
- Big deal! A bag is a bag!
- What could be so interesting?

187
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,232
It can only make a wonder,
like I would believe a thing!

188
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,679
Hey, don't be naughty!

189
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,952
- What are you gossiping about?
- Who spoke?

190
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,710
It's me, the magic bag,
and I'm here for you to see

191
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,955
How wonderful I can be.

192
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,238
I'm a bag, and I'm charmed,

193
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,758
Like no bag in the world.

194
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,556
A wish, in a moment,

195
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,957
If you want, I can fulfill!

196
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,717
Oh, how I enjoy sometimes

197
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,037
Singing, dancing,
telling jokes,

198
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,551
I'm a magic little bag,

199
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,751
If you want,
I'll prove it now.

200
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,715
A minute, if l could ask you
To hold your eyes shut,

201
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,877
That's right, at least try!

202
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,434
Set free all of your
thoughts and your dreams,

203
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,551
And you will see right away,
that I guessed!

204
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,273
Now here is your
dream that's fulfilled.

205
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,832
Like a brave man from the story,

206
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,357
On top of the horse you are flying!

207
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,632
If you give me just one second,

208
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,232
But where is the cake?
Who ate it?

209
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,755
It can belong to anyone, to him,
to you, but only if one day,

210
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,872
You'll be able to say:
 I'm hard- working, I'm rave,

211
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,437
and I'm kind. Respectful and nice,
I can be anytime!

212
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,110
Veronica, Veronica,
such a nice and tender girl,

213
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,109
From now on you are my master,
all your dreams I will fulfill!

214
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,075
But I feel that you still doubt me,
you still keep the thought in your mind.

215
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,750
Oh, don't try to hide it from me,
I can read it in your eyes!

216
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,473
I want the spring to come!

217
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,756
- What did she say?
- Shut up, you!

218
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,958
What did you say, Veronica?

219
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,037
Here comes the spring time,
all over hills and fields,

220
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,949
The whole wide place is
filled up with all the joy it brings.

221
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,271
The orchards are rejoicing
of all the songs we sing,

222
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,911
Oh spring, give us a sign,
if you hear our welcoming!

223
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,877
Oh spring, give us a sign,
if you hear our welcoming! 

224
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,197
Here comes the spring time,
in spinach you should fall!

225
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,957
'Till the evening comes,
I'll clean the house by then!

226
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,757
Everything is ready now,
and about the spinach,

227
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,429
'Till it's boiling in the bowl,
I will play sotron!

228
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,510
Instead of playing now sotron,
you should watch the bowl!

229
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,990
Here comes the spring time,
the sky has no more clouds,

230
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,391
Look at my crown of flowers,
it seems more beautiful!

231
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,116
Nobody will dare today
to laugh in my face,

232
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,592
- l have by far the best voice!
- You sing with your nose!

233
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,156
I think you'll become an as,
at the double bass!

234
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,394
Be careful,
keep your head straight!

235
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,317
Here comes the spring time,
And I will learn to fly,

236
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,031
I still need a clock,
to wake me up in time!

237
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,596
I think we should have
by now a new set of fur.

238
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,237
- Hey, wait, where are you going?
-I want to get some sleepers.

239
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,357
I want my sleepers to be red,
So I could dance with them!

240
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,511
Here comes the spring time,
on the wings of wind,

241
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,195
I'll take the violin,
and learn how to sing!

242
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,949
Pop music is my life,
because I love it so much.

243
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,312
- Sing us something, anything!
- Beee, e, e...

244
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,079
- Any other lyrics?
- Beee, e, a...

245
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,916
Here comes the spring time,
with flowers everywhere,

246
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,197
The whole place is dressing
up in clothes of holyday!

247
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,677
The world is yours today,
So, smile while you're a child,

248
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,270
Everywhere you look, you'll
see people sing and dance!

249
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,350
Oh, little magic bag, look
at the bird how she flies,

250
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,476
Under the deep blue sky,
oh, how I wish I could fly!

251
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,429
Make me, little bag, so small,
and so light, just like a fly,

252
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,438
Like an arrow, like a swallow,
I would fly towards the sun,

253
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,590
Higher and higher, on the wings
of wind, the silver clouds to see!

254
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,753
Higher and higher,
higher and higher,

255
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,393
Oh, how great it feels!

256
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,558
I like it, I like it,
just like a dream it is!

257
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,479
She can fly!

258
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,071
Look at her!

259
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,555
Higher and higher, on the wings
of wind, the silver clouds to see!

260
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,990
Higher and higher,
higher and higher,

261
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,593
Oh, how great it feels!

262
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,513
I like it, I like it, just
like a dream it is!

263
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,750
Give it to me, too!
Give it to me, too!

264
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,035
This is it!
This is it!

265
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,229
It is mine and this it!

266
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,749
l won't give it.

267
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,598
Please, would you
lend me the bag?

268
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,236
l won't do anything to it!

269
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,919
I won't give it and that's it!

270
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,272
But I want to fly too!

271
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,799
l won't give the bag to you!

272
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,600
But please, won't you
give it just a bit?

273
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,751
I promise I won't ruin it!

274
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,997
Veronica, Veronica,

275
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,832
I believed you were a nice girl!

276
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,115
You are changed now,
and it hurts me,

277
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,028
- I can't stand seeing you like that!
- Magic bag! Don't leave!

278
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,949
You hurt me. I'm leaving,
so long and good bye!

279
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,757
From now on, you'll have
to find your own way.

280
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,833
You'll have to embrace some
paths full of silence,

281
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,272
That's when your thoughts
will crawl back to me.

282
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,910
The Fairytale Goddess
is asking me to leave you.

283
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,110
To go away from you.

284
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,156
I must fly away,
somewhere in the sky,

285
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,593
But when you deserve it,
you'll easily find me!

286
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,392
My little bag!
Don't leave!

287
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,230
Wait!
My little bag!

288
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,397
Don't leave!

289
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,393
Don't leave!

290
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,399
Wait!
Don't leave!

291
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,676
Don't leave, little bag!

292
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,716
My little bag!

293
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,999
My little bag!

294
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,873
- Who is there?

295
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,235
My little bag!
What am 
 to do?!

296
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,869
What am 
 to do?!

297
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,237
Look at here!
Such a little girl alone in the woods!

298
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,590
Why is she crying?
What happened to her?

299
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,276
She must have come after
wild strawberries, blackberries,

300
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,358
And perhaps she forgot the way home.

301
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,030
Hello,
I'm the Glow Worm,

302
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,391
And, as you can see,
I'm a piece from a star.

303
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,949
l have come to bring hope,
and to lighten your way anytime!

304
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,358
You will never see me sad!

305
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,473
This is me,
I'm always happy!

306
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,950
Would you like me to come closer?
Hold your hand,

307
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,356
but what a sad little girl.
And why is that?

308
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,235
l have lost my little bag,
The Fairytale Goddess gave it to me!

309
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,748
But you should better
tell me about you!

310
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,477
As I said before,
I am the Glow Worm,

311
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,718
And if you want to
come into my world,

312
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,790
If you want to be small,

313
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,918
All you'll have to do
is repeat after me:

314
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,438
Tiribomb, ciribomb, tiribomb!

315
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,794
Three times over your head,
halei - hop!

316
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,434
Tiribomb, ciribomb, tiribomb,

317
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,836
Where's the Goddess?
Where's my bag? Where are they?

318
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,031
Both of them, I guess,
are far away,

319
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,716
In a world where the sun
is always shining,

320
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,838
But I don't belong there, anyway!

321
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,271
I am the Glow Worm,

322
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,992
As you can see,
I'm a piece from a star.

323
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,517
And I can fly only at night.

324
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,197
What am Ito do,
because this is my life!

325
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,118
Tears are no good,

326
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,478
You should always be happy!

327
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,717
You'll always find a friend in me
to help you when you are in need!

328
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,437
You poor, little girl,

329
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,433
Whenever you want to call,

330
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,349
I'll come, no matter how far,
A whistle is my signal!

331
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,550
We are the inseparable brothers,

332
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,037
And if you want to meet us,
You should come in the woods!

333
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,552
Although we have a bad reputation
And we sing about our enemies,

334
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,072
We're hiding behind the nettles.
After they catch us cheat,

335
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,714
We always start to sing:

336
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,317
 Bu - bu - bunny, we have
no fear of the enemy!

337
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,789
We are among the coward ones!

338
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,918
Ah! Ah! Ah!

339
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,238
Raven, dear!

340
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,276
Why are you in such a hurry?

341
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,434
Excuse me,
I don't think! know you!

342
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,319
How dare you?

343
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,559
You will get to know me!

344
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,912
Hey, old raven!

345
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,631
How was your
stealing today, dear fox?

346
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,353
Me stealing?

347
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,149
You're offending me!
Am I stealing?

348
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,840
Of course you are!
It's you!

349
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,919
How dare you speak
to me Ii e that?

350
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,834
It never happened
to me such a thing!

351
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,430
It is only by honest
work, that I live!

352
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,558
The whole forest knows it!

353
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,673
Almost everyone knows me!

354
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,158
Day by day, life in the woods

355
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,433
Becomes harder and harder to live!

356
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,915
The raven isn't used to steal.

357
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,679
But me, if l don't cheat,
I have nothing to eat!

358
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,390
When I see you walking slowly,

359
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,556
You are so full of yourself,

360
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,197
But one day I'll leave you
without feathers, yes, I swear!

361
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,676
You, where did you come from?

362
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,870
I'm looking for the Fairy Goddess,

363
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,318
To cry and ask for forgiveness!

364
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,031
Because I was mean and selfish,

365
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,118
I want to beg her,

366
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,240
to give me back the bag,
with its magic power.

367
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,991
All my sadness would be gone,
I want to play with the other children.

368
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:54,594
There's no such thing as magic bag!

369
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,275
But if it were, it would be
first an object in my house!

370
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,036
Of course it's true
what happened then,

371
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,556
And no one's guilty as I am!

372
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,393
She's a mean goddess!

373
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,152
No, she isn't!

374
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,551
And she taught me this:

375
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,876
 A minute, if l could ask,
Hold your eyes shut.

376
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,870
That's right. At least try!
Set free all of your thoughts and dreams,

377
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,196
And you will see right away
that I guessed,

378
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,240
Now here is your
dream that's fulfilled!

379
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,718
This girl seems
to be pretty smart!

380
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,948
What if I took her in my class?

381
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,799
To help me at my
business  sometimes.

382
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,434
Or else, I don't know
what she could do!

383
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,154
I really don't know
what happened to me,

384
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,759
I admit I begin to like you!

385
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,514
I could keep you all
summer with me, if you want!

386
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,078
Now tell me, what 
do you know to do?

387
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,951
Do you know how to steal?
Do you know how to lie?

388
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,757
Or maybe you know how
to flatter someone!

389
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,314
Do you know how to sneak
with the pray through the brushwood,

390
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,920
Without even making a noise?

391
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,358
- Do you know how to steal?
- I don't know how to steal!

392
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,470
- Do you know how to lie?
- I don't know how to lie!

393
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,398
Or, maybe you know
what revenge means?

394
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,957
Don't worry,
I'll teach you some things,

395
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,351
Because I'm the master
of all these tricks!

396
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,111
I want to go to the bag
and the Goddess!

397
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,028
This isn't hard at all, little girl,

398
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,479
Come on, come with me,
and just take my hand!

399
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,273
If you listen to me,
I'll help you myself,

400
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,514
I will protect you
from any danger,

401
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,954
When you're in need,
I'll keep you safe!

402
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,718
But only if you promise me

403
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,673
That you will always listen to me.

404
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,398
- And you would steal!
- Yes, I will steal!

405
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,158
- And you would lie!
- Yes, I would lie!

406
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,192
And you'd learn how to flatter,

407
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,310
- And also be sneaky...
- Yes, I'll be sneaky!

408
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,237
- Through the brushwood...
- Through the brushwood...

409
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,358
With the pray you would come,

410
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,752
Any word is a vow.

411
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,470
From now on, you must
only listen to me!

412
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,149
Don't worry, I'll teach
you some things,

413
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,113
Because I'm the master
of all these tricks!

414
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,236
- Are you with me?
- I'm with you!

415
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,993
She's with you!

416
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,473
Now listen carefully:

417
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,872
Your face must seem
so innocent,

418
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,554
When you prepare
to play the trick.

419
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,033
Did you see?

420
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,994
They really thought
that I was sick!

421
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,078
To know how to act,
and when to pretend,

422
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,196
It is indeed the biggest art!

423
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,752
What are you doing?
Look over here!

424
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,791
Don't run so fast,
there is no need!

425
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,191
Don't worry, I'll teach
you some things,

426
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,637
Because I'm the master
of all these tricks!

427
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,510
Look over here!
A green, stupid frog,

428
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,715
And my wish for a pickle
is starting to grow!

429
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,678
What do you want
to do with the bag?

430
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,032
Give it to her!

431
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,438
Oh, no, you won't, when
I've worked so hard to get it!

432
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,398
Such good smelling sausages!

433
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,111
Is that smoking ham?
It is!

434
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,671
What a flavour!

435
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,112
How to resist not stealing them
When the evening comes?

436
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,756
What have you learned
from what I've taught?

437
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,197
Right now you'll
give your first try!

438
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,588
Throughout the brushwood
you'll sneak with the pray,

439
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,150
- Without even making a noise!
- No noise!

440
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,150
Behold, here comes Danila!

441
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,437
He lives in his own world!

442
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,432
The entire wood is looking,

443
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,238
At the greatest fisher, now!

444
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,439
Mister Raven, with a cow- tow,

445
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,793
Tell me please,
what's going on?

446
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,348
You're not a bird,
you are a wonder,

447
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,193
Is it by magic that
you've changed?

448
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,999
Oh, milord,
what a beauty!

449
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,599
I've never seen
such thing before!

450
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,678
Your feathers seem
like pure gold!

451
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,192
You're simply gorgeous,
on my pride!

452
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,798
- Did you hear it?
- Yes, I heard it.

453
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,156
She has a hidden thought, the fox.

454
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,990
She will sing,
she will dance,

455
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,512
And let's see
what happens next!

456
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,597
You look so stunning,
even brighter...

457
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,630
Oh, it's the cheese
she's after now!

458
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,230
You look so stunning,
even brighter...

459
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,192
But the cheese is tastier!

460
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,033
You look so stunning,
even brighter,

461
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,194
but I've never heard
you sing before.

462
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,397
I bet that you can't sing at all.
Oh, its such a shame,

463
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,313
I'm dying with the thought of it.

464
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,470
My voice is very powerful,

465
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,831
And if l sing, I'm afraid
that I might kill!

466
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,199
Did you see?

467
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,198
Here, I proved it one more time!

468
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,037
You have to know
how to flatter him,

469
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,513
And it's the best
that you can leave!

470
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,558
I wasn't careful!

471
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,398
I wasn't smart!

472
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,315
It's with a flattery
that I got drunk!

473
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,836
Who knows,
maybe someday I will be

474
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,629
A hero from fable,
who knows, I might be!

475
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,835
Sure you will!

476
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,112
At last,
I see myself at home!

477
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,792
I feel so tired,
just a bit!

478
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,835
Still, I haven't brought anything,

479
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,389
Not even a chicken,
or a cockalorum.

480
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,152
But who knows?
Maybe next morning!

481
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,440
Maybe I'll have some more luck,

482
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,395
And in my way
I'll find a duck!

483
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,474
To eat it,
including the beak!

484
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,796
It's getting harder
and harder to be,

485
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,789
Versatile and careful,

486
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,399
To sneak each day,

487
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,992
To grab a chicken
as fast as you can!

488
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,395
You always have
to fight everyday,

489
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,714
The obstacles that
come in your way!

490
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,278
Night after night,
day after day!

491
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,629
To keep on smiling
throughout the bushes,

492
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,278
Throughout the brushwood,

493
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,758
Here comes another hunting day!

494
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,829
When will I see
my Fair Goddess again?

495
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,797
You don't deserve
yet such a thing!

496
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,437
Now, you must go
to the open road,

497
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,997
And wait there
for the cat to go.

498
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,193
As soon as he's left,
sneak in the garret!

499
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,274
And fast, you must steal
everything, all of it!

500
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,198
From the garret?
All of it!

501
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,158
Now I Runglo'

502
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,113
Mister!

503
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,073
The mouse Aurica!

504
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,071
Do you happen to know where Danila,
the famous cat lives?

505
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,198
I have a letter to deliver.

506
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,197
My name is Daniela, the cat,

507
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,592
And I'm the bravest of my kind!

508
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,114
I have no pity on the mice,

509
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,952
I keep them here, under my nose!

510
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,156
I see them; I hear them,
wherever they hide,

511
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,875
Even if they went to the Pole,
North or South!

512
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,317
My moves, they say,
are very fast.

513
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,239
I want my claws
to be the best!

514
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,038
My name is Danila, the cat,

515
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,588
And I'm the bravest
of my kind!

516
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,955
Mister cat,
I'm not your enemy,

517
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,957
I only brought
a letter to you!

518
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,758
What's in it?

519
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,838
Little maid, I'd have some work,

520
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,316
But what do you know
how to do, my dear?

521
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,997
I dust the floor,

522
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,352
and I even cook,

523
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,913
- I can dust...
- Never mind.

524
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,153
I think I need some help around.

525
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,750
Do you know how to drizzle
the flour and the maize?

526
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,555
- I would say... not really!
- You'll learn.

527
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,798
And now, please,
enter the house,

528
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,312
To see the place
you're working in!

529
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,798
My name is Daniela,
the cat

530
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,358
And my fist is like a mace.

531
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,118
I have no pity on the mice,

532
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,553
I'm the greatest cat of all!

533
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,078
I have to live again,

534
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,078
Now, remember how to drizzle,

535
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,470
Just listen carefully:

536
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,069
to the left...,
and to the right...

537
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,879
But, I really don't know
if I can.

538
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,798
My name is Danila,
the cat,

539
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,914
And I'm the bravest of my kind!

540
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,713
I have no pity on the mice,

541
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,193
I keep them here, under my nose.

542
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,158
With me they have no luck,

543
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,913
I don't like to play along!

544
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,239
I feel and hear everything,
And I grab them instantly!

545
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,673
My moves, they say,
are very fast.

546
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,358
I want my claws
to be the best!

547
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,158
My name is Danila,
the cat,

548
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,473
And I'm the bravest of my kind!

549
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,549
Be hard- working, did you hear?
Now start!

550
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,317
My, oh my,
how scared I am!

551
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,717
I have to run home,

552
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,078
But all the doors are locked,

553
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,238
And I cannot get out!

554
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,712
Locked in here, all by myself,

555
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,237
The cat wouldn't let me out!

556
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,597
I'm still small, that's my blame,

557
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,678
Oh, how hard became my fate!

558
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,157
Maybe for a little while
I'll forget about my fear!

559
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,558
I may be trapped here by the cat,

560
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,310
But I know how to become
even smaller than I am,

561
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,398
So, I could play with you, dear mice!

562
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,593
Tiribomb, ciribomb, tiribomb!

563
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,519
Three times over the head,
halei - hop!

564
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,599
Tiribomb, ciribomb, tiribomb!

565
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,119
Three times over the head,
halei - hop!

566
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,868
I have been chosen, my dear,
Among all the mice,

567
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,309
And I'm ready to present you
All of my friends!

568
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,353
As you can see, they are small,
You shouldn't be afraid!

569
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,631
There are many singers, dancers
In the who e wide world.

570
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,713
They are all mice, and they're my friends.
You have the chance to see a great show,

571
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,356
If you'd allow me
to present them:

572
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,909
The lead singer:
do - do - crunch,

573
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,474
Re - re - crunch,
mi - mi - crunch,

574
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,954
The dancer:
sol - sol - sol!

575
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,434
She is la - la - crunch,

576
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,789
The passionate guitarist,

577
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,110
The wonderful trombonist.

578
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,793
And the others, great actors,
As they stand in line!

579
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,752
Do - do - crunch,
Re - re - crunch,

580
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,631
Mi - mi - crunch,
Fa - fa - crunch,

581
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,552
Sol - sol - crunch,
La - la - crunch,

582
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,033
Ti - ti - crunch,
Do - do - crunch.

583
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,749
My name is Aurica
And I sing: Tra - la - la,

584
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,360
You've never seen me sad,
Tra - la - la- la.

585
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,279
If you listen to me,
You will know our story!

586
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,000
- Tell me!
- We are afraid of the cat!

587
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,916
When he's mad?

588
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,474
- He's a real dictator...
- He is angry too...

589
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,718
But the truth has come to light:
That he is fool and vain!

590
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,752
This is why,
when he is gone,

591
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,435
You will see us
in his home!

592
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,392
The table,
what a stage becomes!

593
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,476
And we start
to sing and dance.

594
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,274
My name is Aurica,
And I sing Tra - la- la,

595
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,789
I'm always happy,
Tra - la - la,

596
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,150
Even if you have
worries and needs,

597
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,998
You should happy like us!

598
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,518
If you allow me:
Veronica,

599
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,673
Just a girl,
like any other,

600
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,315
It fulfills you any dream!

601
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,109
- What's it like?
- It's wonderful!

602
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,239
It only comes once
in your life.

603
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,358
Please, tell us
one more time,

604
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,675
What's it like,
the magic bag?

605
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:18,593
Just a second, that's it,
If you hold your eyes shut,

606
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,432
The thing that you wished for
Is there in your face!

607
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,269
Anything that crossed your mind,
My bag would surely guess!

608
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,352
Take me with you, Veronica!

609
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,076
I want to go so far from here!

610
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,556
Maybe in our way we'll find

611
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,638
The Dandelion Fairy!

612
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,470
And now let's sing and dance!

613
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,558
Aren't you afraid of Danila?

614
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,750
Danila?
Of him we have no fear!

615
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,952
Let us all sing in choir!

616
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,228
Come on, bite, and bite!

617
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,960
Look in here,
great Danila!

618
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,149
Look in here,
the bravest cat!

619
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,754
I hear and smell from faraway,

620
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,319
And instantly I grab the pray! 

621
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,111
But he doesn't see me,
when I'm three meters far.

622
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,839
What luck!

623
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:20,515
So, slowly through the bushes,
now I will disappear!

624
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,756
My name is Danila,
the cat,

625
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,271
And I'm the bravest
of my kind!

626
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,950
I have the keenest eyes by far,

627
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,590
It's on the flue that
I have my house!

628
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,395
I don't run from mice,
I simply can't get them!

629
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,390
And I would like to make all of them
My friends!

630
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,838
My name is Danila,
the cat

631
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,110
And I went hunting
in the woods

632
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,118
I have no pity
on the mice.

633
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,470
Let's sing along together:

634
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,552
Do - do - crunch,
Re - re - crunch,

635
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,597
Mi - mi - crunch,
Fa - fa - crunch,

636
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,512
Sol - sol - crunch,
La - la - crunch,

637
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,352
TI - ti - crunch,
Do - do - crunch!

638
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,075
When the cat is gone,
The mice are on the table,

639
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,795
When the cat is gone,
Life is so beautiful!

640
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,191
I would like some face powder,
So I could put some make- up on!

641
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,074
And so, in the flash- light,
I will sing for you all!

642
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,510
If the cat had bells
at her neck, to ring,

643
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,754
At night, a lot of mice
would keep her company!

644
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,516
But if she did the house- keeping,

645
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,878
Oh, how much trouble
would there be!

646
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:14,195
Throughout the house,
there are a lot of mice,

647
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,190
They could fall from any
corner right into her mouth!

648
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:27,672
But, there is no
 if  for us, it is not our cat!

649
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,352
If the cat bells at
her neck, to ring,

650
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,913
At night, a lot of mice
would keep her company!

651
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,632
Life is beautiful,
and I'd keep on singing

652
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,069
From all my heart!

653
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,115
I forgot about the cat!
He is stubborn, and so mean!

654
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,516
I forgot it in a second,
Singing here with you!

655
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,309
When the cat is gone,
The mice are on the table,

656
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,355
Make room on the stage of the mill,
For, the dancers are coming!

657
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,679
And when we know the cat is gone,
You should see his home!

658
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,999
On the table up we jump
And we dance a ct!

659
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,159
Life is so beautiful and I'd keep on singing
From all my heart!

660
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,230
Life is so beautiful and I'd keep on singing
From all my heart!

661
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,552
Hey, Miss Fox,
are you home?

662
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,639
I just want to have a word!

663
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,869
Have you come through all this heat
Only for a word?

664
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,436
So that you know,
I don't want to joke!

665
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,114
Today I am very upset!

666
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,552
Upset?
And for what reason?

667
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,876
- Hey, fox, you stole from me!
- How?

668
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,839
Yes, indeed,
you stole from me!

669
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,996
Look, my bag is empty!

670
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,677
I swear on what
I have more sacred,

671
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,191
I didn't steal a thing!
But what's flying in the wind?

672
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,238
- You will pay for it!
- What will I pay?

673
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,396
- Thirty fishes!
- Thirty fishes?

674
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,478
And on the top,
you'll get a fee!

675
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,911
I will tell you right away

676
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,198
Who tried to steal from you.

677
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,276
If I missed eating a fish

678
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,479
I would simply ask you.

679
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,237
And I would give
it if you asked me.

680
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,030
I'm not capable of stealing!

681
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,356
Bu I think! know who did it!

682
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,315
- That little girl...
- Veronica?

683
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,473
You should come
along with me,

684
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,633
To see the revenge
I'm going to take!

685
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,910
Mad, but fine!

686
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,232
Everybody,
everybody!

687
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,437
There is only one like Aurica,

688
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,910
And he has no fear at all!

689
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,676
Everybody, everybody!

690
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,312
Call all the cats in here,

691
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,597
To beat them and
to take their money,

692
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,677
Everybody, everybody!

693
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,077
When the cat is gone,
The mice are in the house.

694
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,510
When the cat is gone,
Oh, how life is nice!

695
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,671
Everybody, everybody,

696
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,191
Everybody, everybody,

697
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,749
You say you sleep,
you say you're sick,

698
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,951
He thinks he's great,
just look at him!

699
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,474
Everybody, everybody,

700
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,192
On your poor little claws,

701
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,199
I wouldn't give a thing!

702
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,033
Everybody!

703
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,589
Why are you running from Danila?

704
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,076
I wouldn't harm you anyway!

705
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,949
You know how
I've always wished

706
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,959
For us to be best friends!

707
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,070
You know how much I care

708
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,350
For all the little mice, right?

709
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:39,708
And I've always wished them,
Only the best!

710
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,553
Is that so?
But who believes you?

711
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,839
I swear on what I've got!

712
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,113
I don't believe a
word you're saying,

713
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,994
You're just a cat!

714
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,919
Where is he?

715
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,993
He's gone.

716
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,313
Where, where is he?

717
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,319
He's, he's gone.

718
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,479
Where could be the big cat?

719
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,999
Let's go, let's go,
Let's go and find him!

720
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,918
Let's go, let's go,
Let's go and find him!

721
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,993
He is dead, he is dead,
he is dead!

722
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,993
So what, so what,
so what?

723
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,316
- He is dead!
- So what?

724
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,390
- He is dead!
- So what?

725
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,590
He is dead!

726
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,076
Mercy !
Mercy!

727
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,276
Among all you must know best,

728
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,639
It was you,

729
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,513
It was you,

730
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,988
It was you
I loved the most!

731
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,995
I hear?

732
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,715
Mercy!
Mercy!

733
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,672
Our cat is dying here!

734
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,272
We must go and save him!

735
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,753
We're not going anywhere!

736
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,038
Come with us, all of you!
Let's go and save him!

737
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,755
Oh, no!

738
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,679
Come!

739
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,078
Poor cat!

740
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,633
Let him die!

741
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,197
Poor cat!
Oh my! Oh my!

742
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,432
He deserved it,
he deserved it,

743
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,277
He isn't worth saving!

744
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,799
We will go, we will go'

745
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,038
We want to save the cat!
To bad!

746
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,038
- Not that bad!
- Yes, it's bad!

747
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,799
- Aurica!
- Some space, please!

748
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,557
If I am to save your soul,

749
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,159
What will be,
what will be,

750
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,992
My...reward?

751
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,237
Mercy!
Mercy!

752
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,270
Oh, how low
your voice is now!

753
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,951
Mercy!
Mercy!

754
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,872
Your clock is ticking faster,

755
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,193
And if l am to save your soul...

756
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,312
Save me at once!

757
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,274
Which will be my reward?

758
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,398
Aurica, save me, please!

759
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,117
I want you to give your word

760
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,958
That you would leave us alone,

761
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,552
And you would keep the pact,
no matter what!

762
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,678
I swear I would do that!

763
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,958
I would never touch a mouse,
I would never harm them,

764
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,556
And in any circumstance,
I'd even protect them!

765
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,558
You gave your word, Danila,

766
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,798
That you'd leave us alone!

767
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,913
I'll know how to keep the vow,

768
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,438
If I could only be free at last!

769
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,992
Do - do - rup,
Re- re- rap,

770
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,359
Mi - mi - rup,
Fa - fa - rap,

771
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,072
Sol - sol - rup,
La - la - rap,

772
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,633
Ti - ti - rup,
Do - do - rap!

773
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,558
A pact made when in need,

774
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,633
To get rid of the pain!

775
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,238
The cat won't change
his way of life,

776
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,596
He's still our enemy!

777
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,718
My name is Danila, the cat,

778
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,518
But 'till now,
I've been to kind

779
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,232
Tolerating you!
I'm sick!

780
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,394
From now on,
I'll have no mercy,

781
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,039
And you'll see at once,

782
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,839
I will get my vengeance,

783
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,516
And you'll all be gone!

784
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,674
I have no pity on the mice,

785
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,518
I even made a plan,

786
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,511
My name is Danila, the cat,

787
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,872
And I'm the greatest of my kind!

788
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,953
With me, they have no luck,

789
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,593
For I don't play at all!

790
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,310
And I have no thought
of letting go of it!

791
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,952
Oh, everybody,
come and see

792
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,278
The bravest of my kind!

793
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,628
My name is Danila, the cat,

794
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,910
And I'm going to get rid
Of the enemies, you'll see!

795
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,993
I'll teach you good!

796
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,153
Veronica, Veronica,
You are such a nice girl,

797
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,675
Is there any hope?

798
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,999
To save little Aurica,

799
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,873
What are we to do?
We are small!

800
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,673
Wait, I've got an idea,

801
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,760
Right away I'll send the message,

802
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,197
And in a second
should appear,

803
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,993
Tiri - biri, the Glow Worm,

804
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,198
Sleep tight, sleep tight,
little cat!

805
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,596
I want you to sleep very deep!

806
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,197
Sleep tight, sleep tight,
little cat,

807
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,549
So I can get out of here!

808
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,279
Help!

809
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,754
She got away!

810
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,439
Help!

811
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,593
Wait!

812
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,439
Let me keep it straight!

813
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,710
It's so quiet in the woods,

814
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,910
I'm starting to be afraid...

815
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,791
Who knows, maybe an enemy

816
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,999
Might come along and steal me!

817
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,750
There's nobody next to me,

818
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,670
I've lost little Aurica,

819
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,550
Miss Fox lied to me,

820
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,510
I was afraid of the cat!

821
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,396
A lost child, a poor child,

822
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,593
Will make a hammock in the tree,

823
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,391
Because she didn't listen
to the good advice,

824
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,989
She is far away from her home.

825
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:43,273
It's so quiet in the woods,

826
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,752
The moon seems even bigger,

827
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,630
The stars are running slowly,

828
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,270
Everything is so astounding!

829
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,509
There's nobody here to tell me

830
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,997
Before I went to bed:

831
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,110
 Good night'! Veronica!

832
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,876
Sleep tight , Veronica!

833
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,152
It's me, the Glow Worm

834
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,189
And, as you can see,
I'm a piece from a star!

835
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,716
Sleep tight, good nig ht!

836
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,350
Sleep tight, sleep tight, my dear!

837
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:46,277
I'll be hear, beside you,

838
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,677
And watch your restful sleep!

839
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,556
But I want the little bag

840
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,069
Be patient, she might sleep!

841
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,039
A minute if l could ask you
To hold your eyes shut:

842
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,071
That's right, at least try,

843
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,192
Set free all of your
thoughts and your dreams,

844
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,994
And you'll see right
away that I guessed!

845
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,830
Now, here is your
dream that's fulfilled!

846
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,912
Veronica, Veronica,

847
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:43,556
now forget of all the sadness!

848
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,633
I have brought the magic
bag once again, it is my gift!

849
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,200
Don't stay, run and play!

850
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,550
Live, don't dream of fairytales!

851
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,075
Halei - hop,
halei - hop!

852
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,869
Over your head,

853
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:07,396
With the magic little bag,

854
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,672
You'll fly all around the world!

855
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:17,193
And, whenever you are sad,
Dreaming will save the day!

856
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:21,030
Here comes the spring time,
with flowers everywhere,

857
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:24,993
And there's no time for dreaming;

858
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,078
When the whole world is yours!
Laugh with me, childhood,

859
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,715
Everywhere the children
sing and dance,

860
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,674
It can belong to anyone,
to him, to you,

861
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,271
But only if one day,
you'll be able to say:

862
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,433
I'm hard working,
I'm brave and I'm kind,

863
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,789
Respectful and nice,
I can be anytime!

864
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,717
Veronica, Veronica,

865
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,475
keep on dreaming and be happy,

866
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,230
Veronica, Veronica,

867
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:21,190
any dream might become true!

868
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,391
Veronica, Veronica,

869
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,231
life can be so beautiful,

870
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,757
Veronica, Veronica,

871
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:51,194
all the time you should rejoice!
