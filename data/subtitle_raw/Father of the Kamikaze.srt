1
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,914
Attention!

2
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,596
Last year, on December 12th...

3
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,070
...several participants in the bombing of
Clark Field in the Philippines, namely...

4
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:20,773
...Flight Sergeant 1st-Class Kawata and
eight officers, were shot down.

5
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,283
Though listed as dead,
on January 2nd...

6
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:32,723
...after the 14th Army Unit's invasion of Manila,
they were rescued from a US prison camp.

7
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,122
At that time in Japan...

8
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:40,894
...prejudice against those who became prisoners
of war was beyond current imagining.

9
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,727
"Do not live to endure the shame
of being a prisoner of war."

10
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:53,746
To be a POW meant ostracism, not only
of oneself but of one's entire family.

11
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:58,045
Coupled with the Japanese mentality,
this created a military force...

12
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:02,679
...that would die rather
than surrender.

13
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:08,459
Hence, the focus of the discussion was,
needless to say, the issue of why...

14
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,826
...Flight Sergeant 1st-Class Kawata and the
eight officers did not commit suicide.

15
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,831
Can we not think of a way that they might
live, instead of ways to kill them?

16
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,129
I understand how you must feel.

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,698
All eight officers have been publicly
listed as casualties of war.

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,779
Hence the situation is quite difficult.

19
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,846
Chief...

20
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,344
if we lose planes,
we can always make more.

21
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,720
But pilots are not made in a day.

22
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:45,628
Indeed, going down with the ship, exploding
with one's plane, these are beautiful ideals.

23
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:51,864
However, our Air Corps
cannot fight like that.

24
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,873
We implore you to find
a way to be lenient.

25
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:10,918
But the conclusion of this incident was
not what Onishi had hoped for.

26
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:27,799
We should've killed ourselves.
We're a disgrace to the Navy.

27
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:33,470
We're traitors!
We should've killed ourselves.

28
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,344
I'm going to die...
I'm going to die!

29
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,245
That's enough!

30
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,018
Calm down!
Enough!

31
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,866
Stupid jackass! What's your little
death going to accomplish?

32
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,872
What's it going to accomplish?!

33
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:07,503
I will die!
I will die!

34
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,779
One month later, shortly after Chief of
Staff Onishi was transferred inland...

35
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:20,257
...the eight officers were ordered to launch
a single-plane attack on Port Moresby.

36
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,127
Single-plane attack,
with no other planes as escort.

37
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,665
The command was tantamount
to suicide.

38
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,501
Thank you very much!

39
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,571
It's from the Kawata plane.

40
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,684
What's the matter?
Is that all?

41
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:33,509
Yes sir.

42
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,740
Note: This is the official war
declaration document.

43
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:15,299
"We, the Emperor,
ruler by divine providence

44
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:18,401
of the Empire of Great Japan...

45
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,572
"...hereby clearly and valorously
declare war...

46
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,176
"...against the United States
and Great Britain."

47
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,735
Mere six months after the
start of the Pacific War...

48
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:09,839
...the western Pacific and Southeast Asia
were under complete Japanese control.

49
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,679
But, after the six-month war of
attrition on Guadalcanal...

50
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,479
...Japan's strategic position
began to deteriorate.

51
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:23,017
Even the Air Force, which had once thought
itself invincible, had, by mid-1944...

52
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,792
...lost most of the elite pilots that
participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

53
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,967
Furthermore, U.S. war industrial output
was six times greater than Japan's...

54
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,530
...and was manufacturing new types
of heavily-armed fighter planes...

55
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:42,577
...that established U.S. air superiority.
By the summer of 1944...

56
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:49,618
...having lost Saipan, the critical
defensive bastion defending the homeland...

57
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,885
...Japan's prospects had
become dire indeed.

58
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,427
Allied forces could now attack
Japanese-held territory...

59
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,624
...from multiple staging
points in the Pacific.

60
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,231
What would be their next move?

61
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,567
While Japanese military intelligence
anxiously tried to answer this question...

62
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,196
...a fierce debate raged between
the Allied commanders.

63
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,743
Admiral King emphasized the importance
of immediately invading Taiwan...

64
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,937
...while General MacArthur argued for
the liberation of the Philippines.

65
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:21,350
The Joint Chiefs of Staff decided upon
the capture of the Philippines.

66
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,918
The Philippines became the focal
point of the entire war.

67
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:31,360
For Japan, losing the Philippines meant
losing crucial Southern Pacific resources.

68
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:38,427
In one fell swoop, the enemy would gain access
to Taiwan, to Okinawa, and even the homeland.

69
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,530
The strategy for defending the Philippines
was codenamed SHO-1.

70
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:47,443
At this stage of the war, it was a battle that
they absolutely could not afford to lose.

71
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,522
Meanwhile, Onishi had been
promoted to Vice Admiral...

72
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:03,357
...and was Vice Director of the Department
of Air Weapons on the Naval General Staff.

73
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:09,662
However, the star of the Naval Air Corps
was headed for the battlefront yet again.

74
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,366
The Emperor himself presided over his appointment
as Commander of the First Air Fleet.

75
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,358
We can no longer win this
war with ordinary tactics.

76
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:44,664
We must use special attack tactics to
destroy the enemy; there is no other way.

77
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:50,766
I am petitioning the Naval General Staff
to organize " special attack" units.

78
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:58,078
Therefore, I have come to you, Vice Admiral
Onishi, for a letter supporting my plan.

79
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,620
Please, give me your recommendation!

80
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:15,097
To turn the tide in our favor, we must not just be
willing to die; it is now necessary that we die.

81
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,865
My firm belief is that we must
make self-sacrificing attacks.

82
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:29,207
We'll pack 1,800 kilograms of explosives
in the nose, and fly to the target.

83
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:33,183
From a height of 6,000 meters,
it will enter a dive...

84
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,254
...and plunge into the enemy
at a very high speed.

85
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:49,462
I'm against it. We can't turn
our pilots into ammunition.

86
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,470
We cannot be so cruel
towards our pilots.

87
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:57,633
I could never agree to such
disgusting tactics.

88
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:13,281
Look at this. Accidents happen,
everyday, even here at the base.

89
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:21,456
We are forced to send our pilots into
battle with only 200 hours of flight time.

90
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,230
To expect skilled piloting
is a dream of the past.

91
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:30,775
They can take off, and fly to the target
locations. That's about all...

92
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,504
...we can ask from our current
cadre of pilots.

93
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,204
This is absolutely unacceptable!

94
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:41,048
No matter how bad things are, we can use
our brains to find a better solution.

95
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,523
Please support my suicide-attack plan!

96
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,391
Vice Director Onishi,
why are you silent?!

97
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:19,884
The demand for suicide attacks
is getting more insistent.

98
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:27,364
I believe that the Navy must make a
firm decision on how to proceed.

99
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,991
Please give me your opinion.

100
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,002
My opinion?

101
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:37,769
Well... it'd be easy to order a suicide attack
if a plane was too damaged to return to base.

102
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:42,143
But to deliberately launch
suicide attacks?

103
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,341
There is no precedent for it in all the
long history of warfare around the world.

104
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:50,887
I did not come here to debate tactics.

105
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,327
I have come to inquire of the Navy's
decision about the SHO-1 operation.

106
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,693
Are we going to implement
suicide attacks?

107
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:05,462
I'm aware of the situation.
I'm aware of it. But...

108
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,063
Let's say that we implement
this strategy.

109
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:14,840
If it is a failure, the effect on military
morale will be catastrophic.

110
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,145
We need the Combined Fleet's
opinion... yes...

111
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,776
We can't decide anything until we hear
the Combined Fleet's opinion.

112
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:27,587
The question is whether or not
we can maintain discipline...

113
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,321
...if the tactic is employed.

114
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,290
Am I correct to assume, then,
that the Combined Fleet...

115
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,063
...is against the implementation
of suicide attacks?

116
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,695
I am not saying that I am against it.

117
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,072
Only that it needs more study.

118
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:50,773
We have done all the research, based
on our earlier skip-bombing training.

119
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:55,786
I believe you are already familiar with the
results, as presented in the report.

120
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:04,160
Undeniably, the suicide attack
tactic is not palatable.

121
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,097
But if we are going to bring calm
to the current maelstrom...

122
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:15,402
...then someone... then some,
brave, someone must...

123
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,671
...belt the cat. We need such courage
more than ever before.

124
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:24,738
Chief. I implore you.
Please decide in its favor.

125
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:27,545
I just finished the assignment ceremony
at the Imperial Court.

126
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,615
I will be departing for the Philippines
tomorrow morning.

127
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,720
Well done. Come, have a seat.

128
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,937
An enemy B-29 has been spotted,

129
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:07,828
heading north above Sagami Harbor...
Did it come from Saipan?

130
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,090
An enemy B-29 has been spotted,

131
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
heading north above Sagami Harbor...
Most likely.

132
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:26,927
This war has turned out
just as you predicted.

133
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:35,035
Like Yamamoto, you were opposed to the
Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact.

134
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:44,712
You never took an aggressive stance,
even in the beginning of the war.

135
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:50,350
You opposed the big battleships, instead
you championed the use of aircraft.

136
00:18:54,766 --> 00:19:00,727
You even advocated changing the Navy
emblem from the anchor to a propeller.

137
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:16,649
Knowing this, it is cruel of us to send you
off to the Philippines so unceremoniously.

138
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:23,684
But we need you to do this.

139
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:28,755
For you are the only man who can do it.

140
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:44,078
There is one thing that I want
you to understand.

141
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:54,081
It's regarding the special attack tactic
that is currently being debated by the Navy.

142
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:09,172
I want you to leave the decision on whether
to use it in the Philippines in my hands.

143
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:18,239
Needless to say, I will take full responsibility
for the success or failure of the air mission.

144
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,385
Is that acceptable?

145
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,733
The enemy B-29 is still headed
north above Sagami Harbor.

146
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:50,804
Although no other enemy airplanes have been
spotted, everyone must remain vigilant.

147
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:04,456
Hey, the evening primrose is about to blossom.
Hurry up and come out here. Hurry.

148
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,195
Come on, you're going to miss it.

149
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,971
Yoshi-e, Yoshi-e.

150
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,601
Hey, mother.

151
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,475
Evening primrose again?

152
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,142
Yeah... so you were listening?

153
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,054
Couldn't help it, I could hear
you from across the street.

154
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,332
We are grateful for your efforts.

155
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:38,137
Thanks.

156
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:45,929
Under different circumstances, I would've
been grateful for my promotion...

157
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:52,466
...but this time it's as if His Majesty
has given me the dagger as well.

158
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:03,210
I've finally found this. It's not a name
brand, but its sharpness is guaranteed.

159
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,190
Please take it with you to the Philippines,
as a memento from me.

160
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,380
You're going too, you know.

161
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:12,723
What? I'm going to the
Philippines too?

162
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,201
Yeah. You'll help us
construct an airfield.

163
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,271
Good grief! I'm going from scrounging
to digging ditches?

164
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,969
Driver will come for you at
06:00 tomorrow morning.

165
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,408
Come back here, and don't be late.

166
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,603
Good grief...

167
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,042
Welcome.

168
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:36,176
Ma'am, it looks like I'll never have time to
find a wife while I'm working for your man here.

169
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,389
Look, it's about to bloom.

170
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,529
It's blooming, it's blooming.

171
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,928
The following morning, Onishi and his staff
departed from Tokyo and flew to Fukuoka.

172
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,008
At Hakozaki Shrine, they prayed
for good fortune in war.

173
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,066
Hey, Hiko-chan, when did you arrive?

174
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,208
Last night. I went to Air Corps and
they said you guys were here.

175
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,320
They told me to bring this to you.

176
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:35,601
Read it for me.

177
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:36,608
Yes.

178
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,487
Looks like there was a massive air
strike on Okinawa this morning.

179
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:53,963
All we know so far is that it was a large
B-29 formation that flew in from China.

180
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,599
That's not right.

181
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,635
What's not right?

182
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:04,003
It's just a hunch, but they
didn't fly in from China.

183
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:09,979
I think the attack was launched
from a fleet of carriers.

184
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,743
And if that is the case...

185
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:17,151
...then building new runways
will be a waste of time.

186
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,689
Then what am I supposed to do?

187
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:26,161
Wait in Shanghai with Yoshida.
Be ready to leave at any time.

188
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,492
Yes sir, understood.

189
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,202
Onishi's intuition was correct.

190
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:39,136
General MacArthur's invasion force,
escorted by Admiral Halsey's fleet...

191
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,213
...was headed straight
for the Philippines.

192
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,109
"I have returned...

193
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,950
"...with a colossal fleet of six
battleships, eighteen aircraft carriers...

194
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:55,720
"...and 700 other vessels escorting
the flagship USS Nashville...

195
00:24:55,827 --> 00:25:01,265
"...carrying 174,000 elite US soldiers,
men who have defeated Nazi Germany...

196
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:08,431
"...men who are the greatest warriors
the world has ever seen."

197
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,101
"The ocean covered with our ships
as far as the eye can see...

198
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,179
"...and it is with them that
I have returned to Leyte."

199
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:21,011
"I have returned, indeed. I have returned."

200
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:29,389
Facing this enemy horde was the First Air
Fleet, with only fifty operational aircraft.

201
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,601
What's that vehicle doing here?

202
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,271
It's got a general's flag. It can't
be Chief Onishi, can it?

203
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,674
If that's Chief Onishi, then Commander
Yamamoto should be with him.

204
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,286
He just arrived yesterday. I'm sure
he's busy making his social calls.

205
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,356
Why would he ever come to a
godforsaken place like this?

206
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,172
Chief!

207
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,111
So what's it like here?
Everyone doing fine?

208
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,514
Yes sir.

209
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,107
The morale is very high.

210
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,176
There's something I need
to discuss with you all.

211
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:58,107
Why don't we... all go back to my inn?

212
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,719
Yes sir.

213
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:13,759
All of you know the true
state of the war...

214
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:19,826
...and that if SHO-1 fails, all is lost.

215
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,602
We must...

216
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:28,509
...by whatever means, defeat the
enemy's seaborne forces.

217
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:32,140
And in no more than a week...

218
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,219
...we have to render the flight decks
of the enemy carriers useless.

219
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,518
To accomplish this...

220
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,222
...we will have to load each of our Zeros
with 250 kilos of explosives...

221
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:51,769
...and send them on suicide-bombing attacks.
I don't believe there's any other way.

222
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,838
What are your thoughts?

223
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,445
Well?

224
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,574
Well?

225
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,883
I am only the Executive Officer
of our Air Corps.

226
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,222
I cannot make such a decision
for the entire squadron.

227
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:20,593
I must wait for Commander Yamamoto to return
from Manila, and see what he has to say.

228
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:26,226
I have already met with Commander
Yamamoto in Manila.

229
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,874
He said I should treat the words
of the Executive Officer...

230
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:37,437
...as if they were his own, and that
he trusts in your decision.

231
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:53,854
Chief. Please give me about 30
minutes to think about this.

232
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,872
Excuse me.

233
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,910
What it is, sir?
It's very late.

234
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,581
Gather everyone in the 10th
squadron together.

235
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,726
Yes sir.

236
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,462
...So I'm waiting for...

237
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,489
Is something wrong, sir?

238
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,597
Coming in!

239
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,375
Everyone's here, sir.

240
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:23,347
Listen carefully. What
I'm about to tell you...

241
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,424
...must never be discussed
outside of this room.

242
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:33,494
Today, Commander-in-Chief
Onishi came to see me.

243
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,192
He proposed launching
a suicide mission...

244
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,270
...packing 250 kilos of explosives
into our Zeros.

245
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,431
However...

246
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,806
...I have not given him
my approval yet.

247
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,243
First I want to hear...

248
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,315
...your frank opinions.

249
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,829
I will do it.

250
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,400
Please let me do it, Executive Officer!

251
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,001
I will go too!

252
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,001
I will do it too!

253
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,571
Me too!

254
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,172
Me too!

255
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:16,705
Me too!

256
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,569
Me too!

257
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,299
Me too!

258
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,534
I will go too!
I will go too!

259
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,679
Please let us!

260
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,484
You really...

261
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,217
...really want to do this?

262
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,389
It's not a matter of wanting
to do it or not.

263
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:40,453
All of us have been together since we were
your students at flight school in Matsuyama.

264
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,467
And look at us now...

265
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,462
At Tinian, Yap, and Palau...

266
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,911
...two-thirds of our comrades have been
killed by those Yankee bastards.

267
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,309
We have to avenge their deaths.

268
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,976
Otherwise, we couldn't face
them in the next life.

269
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,486
That's right. We're all going
to die eventually anyway.

270
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,990
So we might as well crash ourselves
into an aircraft carrier.

271
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,128
You'll see. I'll sink an
entire ship by myself!

272
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,328
This is our chance for revenge!

273
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,297
Everyone, let's do this!

274
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,367
Yeah!

275
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,018
Come in...

276
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,986
Come in...
Entering...

277
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:45,385
Reporting. The 201st Flying Corps...

278
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,021
...has decided to carry out
the suicide attack.

279
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:08,252
Regarding the attack planning, please leave
everything up to the 201st Flying Corps.

280
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:44,146
I'm going to take a little nap. I suggest
you guys do the same.

281
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,259
As you were...
As you were.

282
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,105
Who's going to command
the attack force?

283
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:09,179
I thought I'd let Seki do it.

284
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,277
Seki Yukio?

285
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:18,389
Yes... He was one of your students
at the Naval Academy, wasn't he?

286
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:26,987
Yeah. So... Seki...

287
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,066
Seki will do well.

288
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,624
Come in...

289
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,592
Come in...
Entering...

290
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,803
Have a seat.

291
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,344
Listen, Seki.

292
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:20,108
The Chief came to see us today.
It was about SHO-1.

293
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,881
As you know, Admiral Kurita will be
taking his fleet into Leyte Gulf.

294
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,548
To ensure its success...

295
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,889
...we're going to load our Zeros with 250 kilos
of explosives, and launch a suicide attack.

296
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,954
Well, that's the Chief's plan.

297
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:47,443
We want you to accept the white-feathered
arrow... and command the attack.

298
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,682
Please allow me to do it.

299
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,849
I see...

300
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,078
Come in...

301
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,046
Come in...
Entering...

302
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,556
We have 24 pilots.

303
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,724
We chose a Naval Academy graduate,
Seki, to command the assault.

304
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,989
"Shinpu" as "Kamikaze" - religious meaning.
Executive Officer Tamai

305
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:24,063
and I have chosen "Shinpu squadron."

306
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,531
Japan is truly in danger.

307
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:57,205
Who will rescue us from this danger?
Not the Ministry. Not the Generals.

308
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:04,612
Not the Naval General Staff Secretary-General.
Not the Chiefs, like me.

309
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:10,415
It's those who are pure of heart like
children, those who are brimming with energy.

310
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:15,390
It's only the young who can save us.

311
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:24,391
Therefore I, on behalf of our
entire nation, implore you.

312
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:32,602
All of you are already gods.

313
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:40,179
Since you are all Gods, you are free
from all desires, except one:

314
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:51,559
The desire to know that your suicide
mission had not been in vain.

315
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:59,569
However, all of you will be
sleeping for a long time.

316
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:05,939
So you will not know the answer, and
there will be no way to let you know.

317
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:13,142
But... I will take care of the rest.

318
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,151
I will bear witness to the fruits
of your accomplishments...

319
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:19,781
...and will not fail to personally
report them to His Majesty.

320
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:28,855
And after that... I will come and
tell you what happened.

321
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:38,834
Please... do your best!

322
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,719
They've given us eight Zeros;
That's unusually generous.

323
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,222
Yeah, I've got a bad feeling about
this. What's going on?

324
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:31,884
I don't know. They just told us to bring
them here, so we followed orders.

325
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,596
It's probably a gift from Chief-of-Staff
Onishi on occasion of his visit to Mabalacat.

326
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,203
I see... I knew he'd be good to us.

327
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,412
Come in.

328
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:56,149
What is it?

329
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,756
You won't be keeping me out of the
special attack force, will you?

330
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:04,292
"Kisama:" roughly "bastard"; can be used both angrily
and affectionately. You bastard... so you know about it?

331
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:09,227
The Flight Captain and
I are old comrades.

332
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:15,568
Four planes were brought in today to Cebu
to be used in a suicide squadron.

333
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,231
I'm assuming it's permissible
for me to go too.

334
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,980
Thank you very much.

335
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:09,219
<i>I will eventuality fail...</i>

336
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:17,028
<i>...into an ocean a thousand
fathoms deep.</i>

337
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:29,103
<i>Flowers will bloom on the waves...
above my blue grave.</i>

338
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:46,028
Huh?! It's the Chief!

339
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,866
As you were... as you were.

340
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,381
All of you, sit down.

341
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:11,455
Hey...

342
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:11,755
Hey...
Yes sir.

343
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:11,889
Yes sir.

344
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,857
Let me have the canteen.
Yes sir.

345
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,167
Let's drink together.

346
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,873
Thank you, sir.

347
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,717
What prefecture are you from?

348
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,618
From Shizuoka, sir.

349
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,347
Shizuoka? It's nice.

350
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,492
Yes sir.

351
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,521
We're counting on you.

352
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,665
Yes sir.

353
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,069
How about you?

354
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,000
From Fukui, sir!

355
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,265
Are your parents doing well?

356
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:05,842
Yes sir.

357
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,516
We're counting on you.
Yes sir.

358
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,955
Enemy aircraft! Enemy aircraft!

359
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:49,176
US Bombing raids continued relentlessly
for 19, 20, then 21 days.

360
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,587
When will we ever launch our attack?

361
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:37,963
I heard that reconnaissance managed
to locate the enemy carriers twice!

362
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,036
How much longer must we wait?

363
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,604
The Chief hasn't given the order yet.

364
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,674
And besides, they're a long way away.

365
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:48,074
I told him that I'm not letting you guys
go until we're absolutely sure.

366
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,306
So hang in there. Hang in
there just a little longer.

367
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,382
Shit!

368
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,246
Seki...
Yes sir.

369
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,356
Give me a memento,
something to remember you by.

370
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,158
Huh?

371
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,218
Huh?
It's not for me... the Chief insists.

372
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,260
I understand.

373
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,541
The US submarines Darter and Dace...

374
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:25,741
...spotted the Japanese fleet off the
Palawan Passage, at dawn on October 23.

375
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:30,445
Vice Admiral Kurita's armada was spearheaded
by the battleships Musashi and Yamato.

376
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:36,493
They were the leading actors
on the stage of SHO-1.

377
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:41,530
Decoy fleets were launched to lure
the enemy away from Leyte Gulf.

378
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,329
Meanwhile, the battleships, with their
massive 46cm guns, crept towards Leyte Gulf.

379
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:51,966
Their mission was to pulverize MacArthur's
100,000 men when they tried to invade.

380
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:08,086
Periscope at 90° to port,
distance: 0-5-0!

381
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,660
Ready the depth charges!

382
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,863
Man your stations!

383
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:31,846
And so, over three days, what may be the last
great fleet battle in history took place.

384
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:37,552
Enemy attack, 135°, elevation 10°!

385
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,795
235°, elevation 10°.

386
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,110
Open fire!

387
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:39,941
Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!

388
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,280
Ten planes, 180°, fire, fire!

389
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,993
Got him! Good shooting!

390
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,307
Enemy planes!

391
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,501
Enemy planes!

392
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,343
90° right, elevation 20°!

393
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:19,222
90°, elevation 20°!

394
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,692
Fire!

395
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:14,574
Assholes! Screw it! Now I'm
getting really pissed off!

396
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,355
Gunny!

397
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,969
Gunny!

398
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,278
Shit!

399
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,073
The Musashi received a death-blow.

400
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,456
But the Musashi's death
was not in vain.

401
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,628
Admiral Halsey, upon learning of the
Musashi's struggles on the Sibuyan Sea...

402
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:51,139
...assumed that Kurita's fleet
had been devastated.

403
00:51:51,975 --> 00:52:00,383
Having spotted Ozawa's decoy fleet,
he next headed north to intercept them.

404
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:07,648
The watchdog had been lured out of Leyte;
Japan's strategy was a splendid success.

405
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:17,295
Target: enemy ships deployed off
the coast of Samal. Be careful.

406
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:22,031
Synchronize watches to 7:00...

407
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,733
Fifteen seconds...

408
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,537
Ten seconds...

409
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,306
Five seconds...

410
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,405
Set!

411
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,182
We're off.

412
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,753
Let's go.

413
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,599
Any comments? Just a comment, Captain Seki.

414
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:29,929
Please don't make a big deal out of this.
It's normal for soldiers to die on the battlefield.

415
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:39,438
Okay... I'm going to go die to protect my
wife, the person that I love the most.

416
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,076
Entering!

417
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:33,115
We've received a report about the Shinpu
Shikishima Squadron's mission!

418
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,028
Report to Imperial Headquarters:

419
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:30,435
October 25, 1944.

420
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:37,503
At 10:45 AM, the Shinpu
Shikishima Squadron...

421
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:47,046
...attacked an enemy fleet containing four aircraft
carriers 30nm north-east of Suluan island.

422
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:50,126
The surprise attack was a success.

423
00:58:55,131 --> 00:59:04,938
Two planes struck an aircraft carrier.
It has been confirmed as sunk.

424
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:12,846
One plane struck another aircraft
carrier, which is in flames.

425
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:23,917
One plane struck a cruiser,
it has sunk. End.

426
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:39,034
Make sure you write, "one plane struck,"
and "two planes struck." Do you understand?

427
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:43,738
"One plane... two planes."

428
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,881
Yes sir.

429
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:13,266
Seizing their chance, the Japanese Navy
launched more suicide attacks.

430
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:17,940
However, the chance for victory
had already come and gone.

431
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:24,209
Misled by incorrect intelligence, Kurita's
fleet turned back as they neared Leyte Gulf...

432
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:30,685
...and SHO-1 ended in failure.
The US gained momentum.

433
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:34,245
They invaded Mindoro island, and
reconnoitered the main island of Luzon.

434
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:38,123
Then early the next year,
on January 6th, 1945...

435
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,663
...the last five planes of the 20th Flying
Corps, from Kongo Squadron, took to the air.

436
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:47,725
With no more planes in the Philippines,
Onishi and his men became ground troops.

437
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,737
Enemy planes attacking!
Everyone take cover!

438
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:57,708
Take cover! Take cover!

439
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:01,584
Take cover!

440
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:23,104
Chief! You have to get down!

441
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:37,686
Chief! Why did you do that?

442
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:47,887
Well... I was just observing
the enemy planes.

443
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,794
Please don't be so rash.

444
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,934
I know, I know...

445
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,008
Chief. We have orders from
the Combined Fleet.

446
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:08,851
What do they want me to do now?
There's nothing left to be done.

447
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:13,978
You've been ordered to move
your headquarters to Taiwan.

448
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,589
What?

449
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:19,728
The order is effective as
of the 8th. That's today.

450
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:46,388
Not yet...

451
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:50,592
it is not yet time for me to die.

452
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,599
Attention!

453
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:08,599
Attention!

454
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,185
Fall in!

455
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:28,097
Chief, please wait.

456
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,361
Please stay with us in the Philippines.

457
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,505
Commander Sata!

458
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:44,910
It is only because you have been our
commander, Chief... Chief Onishi...

459
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:50,577
...that we have all gladly endured
the hardships of this war.

460
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,586
Can you acknowledge it?

461
01:04:55,291 --> 01:05:00,786
If so, please stay. I ask you
on behalf of the entire unit.

462
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:06,858
Stay in the Philippines, and fight
the enemy with us, once again.

463
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:11,774
I cannot.

464
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,943
Why not?!

465
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,250
Please understand.

466
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:34,995
If you're going to forsake us, then
I am bold enough to say, Chief...

467
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,065
...that you are a coward!

468
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:45,863
That's right. You are a coward!

469
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:55,644
You sent the special attack
forces on their missions.

470
01:05:55,751 --> 01:06:02,020
You stood on the ground in the
Philippines and saw them off.

471
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:09,087
But now, you're going to leave?
I don't understand it!

472
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:17,930
Chief. Chief Onishi!
You are a coward!

473
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,711
You fool!

474
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,153
You...

475
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,858
...fool.

476
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:41,597
You can't fight a war with
that kind of mentality.

477
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:18,293
Considering the current state of the war, with
the enemy in control of the Philippines...

478
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:27,673
...their forces are fast approaching
the shores of Japan.

479
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:31,338
Their air-raids on the mainland are
intensifying with each passing day...

480
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,007
...while our ability to wage war
is in every way reduced...

481
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:37,643
...and our ally Germany
is similarly beset.

482
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:41,553
We must admit that our situation
is most precarious.

483
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:48,821
However, the real war is yet to begin.

484
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,456
The enemy is growing weaker.

485
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:58,336
Now all Japanese must become special
attack warriors, endure a long war...

486
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:03,902
...and find every means at our disposal to
kill as many of the enemy as possible.

487
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:08,006
Then the Americans, who fear the loss
of their lives, will be defeated.

488
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:14,612
This is the path we must follow
to achieve a glorious victory.

489
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:24,961
In a battle on land, it is impossible for
one man to kill a hundred enemies...

490
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:33,031
...but our flying corps is able to kill a ship
and hundreds of its men with a single plane.

491
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:39,637
We can fight a fight that
is worth dying for.

492
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:45,987
Victory or defeat is determined
in the final battle.

493
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:52,550
Even if we are defeated 99 times, if we win
the final battle, then we are the winners.

494
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:58,622
If we can win that final battle, America
will consider peace with Japan.

495
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:07,599
The war will be a draw.
And a draw is a win for Japan.

496
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:13,173
We might not call it a victory,
but it won't be a defeat, either!

497
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:20,778
The deployment of you fine men of
the Shinpu Special Attack Force...

498
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:28,659
...ensures that even if the impossible
happens and we lose the war...

499
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:32,165
...Japan will not be vanquished.

500
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:39,300
Our strength of will and
lofty spirit are ideals...

501
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:43,071
...that demonstrate our superiority
over the white man.

502
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:47,980
But, if defeated without demonstrating
such character...

503
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:53,989
...Japan would truly be a ruined
nation, a people without hope.

504
01:09:55,858 --> 01:10:03,492
Death is not our goal.
But let us be willing to die...

505
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:11,997
...so that we can kill the enemy more effectively.
Choose the most valuable way to die!

506
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:31,054
I know it's short notice, but could you talk
to the suicide troops about the homeland?

507
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,196
The homeland is in shambles
from air-raids.

508
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,792
I can't tell them the truth.

509
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:44,862
And I can't lie to those who are
about to die. I can't do that.

510
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:54,740
Please... if there is any way
you can encourage them.

511
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,614
I myself have nothing to say.

512
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,092
I understand.

513
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,032
I'm counting on you.

514
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:31,485
Though we are not related in blood and flesh,
we still get along, and never want to part.

515
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,169
Chief... How are things back home?

516
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,273
I hear they've been hit
with a lot of air-raids.

517
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:58,102
You guys are about to go on a mission, so I
won't lie to you. I'll be honest with you.

518
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:04,108
It's true that it's just as bad back home
as it is here on the front lines.

519
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:15,519
But everyone takes heart, knowing that you
men are unleashing the Divine Wind.

520
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:21,227
That's too much. Please don't tell the people
back home exaggerated stories about us.

521
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:26,900
After all, we're in a war; it's going to be
a good death no matter where we die.

522
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:33,948
But... for who are you all
willing to die so calmly?

523
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:40,955
Is it for your country? Or is it
for His Majesty the Emperor?

524
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:45,025
We don't need to make a fancy statement
with our deaths. Right, guys?

525
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,459
I guess I could say I'm going
to go die for the old man.

526
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,001
Admiral Onishi?

527
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:57,166
Admiral Onishi?
Yeah. He wants to die too, you know.

528
01:12:57,273 --> 01:13:04,475
But we can't let him die.
We have to go before he does.

529
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,710
But please, don't tell the
old man what I said.

530
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,729
Understood.

531
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:26,635
Hurry up!

532
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,664
Hurry, hurry, please hurry up!

533
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,800
The Special Attack Force can't take off
if the enemy planes come. Faster!

534
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:44,419
Boss, this is my flight-bento, please
give it to someone who's hungry.

535
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,383
That's for you to eat.

536
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:51,515
If I get full I'll get sleepy. Then who
knows, I might miss the enemy.

537
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,897
We're waiting for the runway.

538
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,569
What kind of bento do the Special
Attack Forces get?

539
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,536
So that's the last meal.

540
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:35,997
Originally, the Special Attack Forces
were Rear Admiral Onishi's...

541
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:41,065
...last-ditch tactic, to be used
only in a dire emergency.

542
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,077
But upon learning how effective it was,
Imperial HQ changed its position...

543
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:51,278
...and ordered all units to make suicide
attacks whenever possible.

544
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:39,623
Nobody will understand.

545
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:45,440
About what?

546
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:55,878
The... suicide attacks...

547
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,953
...violate every rule of leadership.

548
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:14,963
"Even after my coffin is buried,
my reputation will be unsettled."

549
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:20,098
"Even after a hundred years
I will not be understood."

550
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,306
Chief...

551
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,346
Chief...

552
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,926
Let's get going.

553
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:33,504
In this way, suicide missions
became official policy...

554
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:39,687
...and the lives of hastily-trained volunteers
were expended as if they were bullets.

555
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:46,353
Furthermore, suicide missions became less and
less effective as the US adapted to the tactic.

556
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:50,522
Target-hitting accuracy, which
was 80% in the Leyte gulf...

557
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:54,864
...dropped to 50% in Okinawa.

558
01:17:54,970 --> 01:18:01,500
Onishi's greatest fear became reality.
Of the men who were ordered to die...

559
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,273
...more than a few rebelled and refused
to participate in special attacks.

560
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:11,046
Blame, criticism, and vilification was heaped
upon the father of the special attacks.

561
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:14,122
Onishi had to bear it, all alone.

562
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:56,360
Japan's do-or-die counterattacks could not
stop the US march towards the homeland.

563
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:02,026
Large formations of B29s flew almost every
day from bases in the Mariana islands...

564
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:07,598
...indiscriminately fire-bombing cities,
large and small, all over Japan.

565
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:25,691
Eighty-one cities were razed, 2,400,000
houses burned, and 240,000 civilians killed.

566
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:30,460
It was up to the elite aviators of the 302nd
Air Corps squadron of Atsugi Air Base...

567
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:35,332
...men tempered in the skies above Rabaul,
commanded by Captain Kozono Yasuna...

568
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:42,138
...to rise to meet the overwhelming US
forces and protect the Tokyo area.

569
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:38,176
Hey, one B shot down, confirmed.
Report it for me.

570
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:41,848
I'm gonna shoot down two
or three more. Hurry!

571
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,746
Yes sir!

572
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,487
Hurry!
Yes.

573
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:05,898
Slow... slow... stop.

574
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,439
I'll turn it around.

575
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:10,407
Hey Kaida. My plane's
wing-tank's been hit.

576
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:13,072
We can't fill it up.
Let me use your plane.

577
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:17,150
Divisional Captain, please tend to
ground affairs, I'll go do the rest.

578
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:19,787
Don't get cocky, you're not
that good. Now get out!

579
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,014
I mustn't!

580
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,157
Out you get!

581
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:29,259
Divisional Captain, you can't borrow
it for free. I'll bill you later.

582
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:33,390
Fine, we'll have a shogi duel when
I return, so go set up the board.

583
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,481
What did you find out?

584
01:26:34,456 --> 01:26:39,894
Um... We just got word from the Air Defense
Command Post in Yokosuka.

585
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:45,299
He crashed in Hodogaya.

586
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:50,904
Who's got custody of the body?

587
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:53,973
The Third Mechanics Unit is getting him.

588
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:59,975
You stay here! I'll go check on it!

589
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:00,615
Kaida!

590
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:02,583
Kaida!
Hey!

591
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,642
Stop!

592
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:44,474
Stand down! The ammo's exploding
from the heat. Let's wait a while!

593
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,953
It's like Captain Arai's ghost is here.

594
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:12,513
Kaida.

595
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:18,074
I'm sorry. Please pardon me.

596
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:25,349
It should have been me,
not the Divisional Captain.

597
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,494
Come with me.

598
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:53,009
You jackass!

599
01:29:53,921 --> 01:30:00,759
It wasn't you that I hit. I hit the God of
Death that's following you around.

600
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:08,598
The God of Death stays close to weepy
guys. You can't do your duty like that.

601
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:14,733
The 302nd Air Corps is not a suicide squad.
As long as we're alive, we fight the enemy.

602
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:22,806
That's our duty. Think hard about how
much the people are counting on us.

603
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:27,554
You can't afford to cry.

604
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:53,377
Nakai...
Sir!

605
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:59,214
Don't offer that sake to the dead.
Let Kaida drink it instead.

606
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:01,355
Yes sir, I will.

607
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,672
Back to work!

608
01:33:11,156 --> 01:33:16,753
In May, 1945, the First Air Fleet
in Taiwan was disbanded.

609
01:33:16,862 --> 01:33:19,456
Vice Admiral Onishi was appointed Vice
Director of the Naval General Staff...

610
01:33:19,564 --> 01:33:23,523
...and ordered home.

611
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:36,946
Welcome home.

612
01:33:43,889 --> 01:33:46,289
It burned down very nicely.

613
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:54,255
I'm so sorry I couldn't
rescue our things.

614
01:33:54,433 --> 01:33:56,264
Where's mother?

615
01:33:56,435 --> 01:34:01,202
She was evacuated to Shimonida in Gunma.

616
01:34:01,373 --> 01:34:03,500
Were you living here all by yourself?

617
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:10,774
No... my relatives, the Chi'iras, have been
letting me stay with them at night.

618
01:34:10,882 --> 01:34:14,648
I just spend my days here...

619
01:34:14,753 --> 01:34:19,713
...to make sure you could find
the house when you return.

620
01:34:23,395 --> 01:34:28,560
I've wandered here and there,
truly, I've been lost.

621
01:34:28,733 --> 01:34:33,432
It's short notice, but the Vice Director must
present himself at the Imperial Court...

622
01:34:33,538 --> 01:34:35,699
...so could you please prepare
his dress uniform?

623
01:34:35,874 --> 01:34:43,906
Oh no. It's been burnt. Had I thought of it,
I would've run out of the house wearing it.

624
01:34:44,082 --> 01:34:47,017
I see.

625
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:50,087
I'll see if I can borrow one
from somewhere.

626
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:52,918
Alright... please do.

627
01:34:53,091 --> 01:34:55,059
Yes sir.

628
01:34:58,563 --> 01:35:00,531
Good job.

629
01:35:04,269 --> 01:35:06,794
I'll make some tea.

630
01:35:06,972 --> 01:35:08,940
Yeah.

631
01:35:30,795 --> 01:35:32,763
Oh... Onishi.

632
01:35:35,767 --> 01:35:38,736
Thank you for all your efforts.

633
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,641
Everyone, my apologies to you all.

634
01:35:45,744 --> 01:35:51,114
Your homes of many years are in ashes,
and it's all the fault of us soldiers.

635
01:35:51,216 --> 01:35:56,176
I sincerely apologize. Please
find a way to forgive me.

636
01:36:07,866 --> 01:36:13,827
I only have a little to share, but...

637
01:36:13,939 --> 01:36:15,133
Rock candy!

638
01:36:15,307 --> 01:36:17,537
Here you go.

639
01:36:17,709 --> 01:36:19,677
Thank you.

640
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:31,188
Here.

641
01:36:33,692 --> 01:36:35,626
Here.

642
01:36:35,794 --> 01:36:38,262
Thank you very much.

643
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:40,523
Thank you very much.

644
01:36:40,699 --> 01:36:42,132
Here, Missus.

645
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,268
Thank you very much.

646
01:36:46,538 --> 01:36:48,506
Here's a present for you.

647
01:37:08,126 --> 01:37:11,095
I can't say that it flatters me.

648
01:37:13,732 --> 01:37:17,793
I can't let the ladies see me like this.
But since it's just the Emperor, who cares?

649
01:37:17,969 --> 01:37:22,929
You look like you've lost some weight.

650
01:37:26,111 --> 01:37:29,672
My countenance has become ugly.

651
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:35,014
This outfit makes me look like Kiratsune
has become a Vice Admiral.

652
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,854
Where will your next official
residence be?

653
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:46,622
Nanpeidai, in Shibuya.

654
01:37:46,798 --> 01:37:49,767
Would it be alright for
me to stay there?

655
01:37:54,773 --> 01:38:03,738
You can stay wherever you want.
But not there, not when we're at war.

656
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:11,854
There are people, parents and children,
struggling to survive.

657
01:38:11,956 --> 01:38:17,451
The suicide warriors went to their deaths
without even knowing family-life.

658
01:38:23,835 --> 01:38:27,396
How then can I enjoy married life?

659
01:38:27,572 --> 01:38:29,563
Yes.

660
01:38:32,277 --> 01:38:39,843
I shook hands with them, with these hands,
and sent them off on suicide missions.

661
01:38:39,951 --> 01:38:42,749
Six hundred and fourteen young men.

662
01:38:45,857 --> 01:38:49,816
Six hundred and fourteen of them...

663
01:38:54,332 --> 01:38:59,736
Meanwhile, the war in Europe
was drawing to an end.

664
01:38:59,838 --> 01:39:05,936
In September of the previous year, Italy, an
ally of Japan, was conquered by the Allies...

665
01:39:06,044 --> 01:39:10,845
...and the fascist dictator Mussolini
was executed by partisans.

666
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:17,281
In May of the same year, Germany fell under
the onslaught of the Russian Army...

667
01:39:17,455 --> 01:39:22,222
...and the Nazi Fuhrer Hitler
committed suicide.

668
01:39:22,327 --> 01:39:28,459
In this way, Japan found itself catastrophically
isolated, with the entire world as its enemy.

669
01:39:29,234 --> 01:39:34,433
The Army believes that if we had
2,000 special attack planes...

670
01:39:34,539 --> 01:39:39,772
...we could devastate the enemy
invasion force at sea.

671
01:39:39,878 --> 01:39:43,211
But is there any solid
data to confirm this?

672
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:45,542
Yes sir.

673
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:50,713
We have results from experiments at Takeyama
Air Base, based on the Vice Director's idea.

674
01:39:50,822 --> 01:39:55,725
If you look at the data and photos,
they will speak for themselves.

675
01:39:55,827 --> 01:39:58,557
Using model No: 25 and No: 50 bombs...

676
01:39:58,663 --> 01:40:02,861
...we tested the effects on the armor used
by enemy aircraft carriers and battleships.

677
01:40:02,967 --> 01:40:08,599
We rammed the explosives into the targets at
the appropriate speed, and the results show...

678
01:40:08,706 --> 01:40:12,142
...that only transport ships could be sunk;
The heavier ships could survive the hits.

679
01:40:16,648 --> 01:40:19,617
Vice Admiral, what is your point of view?

680
01:40:20,819 --> 01:40:22,787
Yes.

681
01:40:24,122 --> 01:40:27,455
Though we can't sink them...

682
01:40:27,559 --> 01:40:36,365
...it's possible to crush their morale
with continuous suicide attacks.

683
01:40:36,467 --> 01:40:40,198
The US military calculates their estimated
losses for each operation.

684
01:40:40,305 --> 01:40:43,672
When their losses exceed this estimate,
they scrap the mission.

685
01:40:43,775 --> 01:40:48,712
That's been their pattern up until now.

686
01:40:48,813 --> 01:40:54,581
We don't know what they estimate their
losses on a mainland invasion will be...

687
01:40:54,686 --> 01:41:02,457
...but if we unrelentingly employ special
attacks, we may convince them to cancel it.

688
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:07,554
But they will respond by increasing
their control over our airspace.

689
01:41:07,665 --> 01:41:11,567
Our planes would be destroyed as soon
as they arrive at our airfields...

690
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:16,470
...before they could depart on
special attack missions.

691
01:41:16,574 --> 01:41:19,702
Strategies based on suicide
tactics are unrealistic.

692
01:41:20,311 --> 01:41:23,644
I admit that what you say is well
within the realm of possibility.

693
01:41:23,748 --> 01:41:28,742
Hence, my belief is that we should not
wait for the enemy to make its move.

694
01:41:28,853 --> 01:41:37,625
We must regain control of our airspace
with bold and aggressive attacks.

695
01:41:37,729 --> 01:41:41,688
Regarding this issue, I will have
Divisional Director Terai explain our plan.

696
01:41:44,435 --> 01:41:47,097
Yes sir.

697
01:41:47,205 --> 01:41:51,699
We propose a ground special attack on the
enemy air bases on Saipan and Tinian...

698
01:41:51,809 --> 01:41:58,271
...aimed at destroying enemy
planes such as the B29s.

699
01:41:58,383 --> 01:42:04,185
On a moonlit night, we land airborne troops
using the enemy's own runways.

700
01:42:04,289 --> 01:42:09,693
They will then use mines to
destroy the target planes.

701
01:42:09,794 --> 01:42:14,822
We have already begun combat training for
the mission at Matsushima Air Base.

702
01:42:14,933 --> 01:42:20,337
We already have several factories
working on perfecting the mines.

703
01:42:20,805 --> 01:42:24,502
When can we launch the attack?

704
01:42:25,276 --> 01:42:29,212
Based on the lunar phase and the training
progress of the troops to be deployed...

705
01:42:29,314 --> 01:42:31,282
...our goal is early August.

706
01:42:34,819 --> 01:42:40,724
How can you avoid enemy
anti-aircraft fire?

707
01:42:40,892 --> 01:42:45,124
If we shadow an enemy squadron as it
returns from a raid on the mainland...

708
01:42:45,229 --> 01:42:50,496
...we believe that it's possible to arrive
at the targets with minimum casualties.

709
01:42:50,601 --> 01:42:54,833
Vice Director, regarding this issue, we have a
plea from the training unit at Matsushima...

710
01:42:54,939 --> 01:42:59,876
...to try out their swords on American POWs
in preparation for hand-to-hand combat.

711
01:42:59,978 --> 01:43:02,446
What should we do?

712
01:43:09,554 --> 01:43:14,287
Such a plea, from those who are willing
to sacrifice their lives on a mission...

713
01:43:14,392 --> 01:43:17,452
...cannot be coldly denied.

714
01:43:17,628 --> 01:43:22,361
I am absolutely opposed! We cannot
kill defenseless prisoners of war.

715
01:43:22,467 --> 01:43:24,435
It would be inhumane!

716
01:43:25,803 --> 01:43:32,675
If news of this were to leak to the US
military, it would fuel their morale and rage!

717
01:43:32,777 --> 01:43:37,908
Look at what happened to Italy and
Germany after they were defeated.

718
01:43:38,016 --> 01:43:43,113
We would be accused of war crimes. We would
be getting ourselves into grave trouble.

719
01:43:44,155 --> 01:43:48,717
His Highness Prince Takamatsu
is present at this meeting.

720
01:43:48,826 --> 01:43:53,889
Vice Director, are you saying that it would
be acceptable to implicate His Highness?

721
01:43:54,065 --> 01:43:59,025
First Divisional Director, is that the
way you should speak to me?

722
01:44:03,908 --> 01:44:05,876
I apologize.

723
01:44:08,746 --> 01:44:12,648
Not only will His Highness have
to bear the responsibility...

724
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,718
...everyone in the military
will be held accountable.

725
01:44:18,523 --> 01:44:23,517
However, the First Divisional Director's
views may have some merit.

726
01:44:23,628 --> 01:44:27,496
So we shall reconsider this
matter at a later time.

727
01:44:27,598 --> 01:44:34,094
However, it is defeatist to even discuss
post-war considerations at this time!

728
01:44:37,275 --> 01:44:47,082
I am willing to bet everything on a single
battle, no matter what our situation might be.

729
01:44:47,185 --> 01:44:51,144
And that final battle is the only one that
we absolutely cannot afford to lose.

730
01:44:53,357 --> 01:44:58,317
Winning that battle is the only parting gift
we can give those who have gone before us.

731
01:45:00,465 --> 01:45:03,798
Perhaps some of you have
already given up...

732
01:45:03,901 --> 01:45:07,769
...believing calculations on paper that we
are outnumbered, and that we cannot prevail.

733
01:45:07,872 --> 01:45:11,035
But we must never give in!

734
01:45:11,142 --> 01:45:16,978
We must be thoroughly committed
to this war; never forget that!

735
01:45:17,148 --> 01:45:22,108
Vice Director! You are out of line.

736
01:45:25,189 --> 01:45:29,523
As for the mission proposed by the Vice
Director, continue the preparations.

737
01:45:29,627 --> 01:45:31,595
Today's council is hereby adjourned.

738
01:45:41,506 --> 01:45:43,474
Minister...

739
01:46:01,692 --> 01:46:04,820
Uncle. It's been a long time.

740
01:46:04,996 --> 01:46:07,965
So you're back.

741
01:46:11,669 --> 01:46:18,131
We got a telegram saying to come back at
once. We flew directly from Shanghai.

742
01:46:18,242 --> 01:46:20,210
What is the occasion?

743
01:46:23,381 --> 01:46:25,076
It's copper. Copper.

744
01:46:25,249 --> 01:46:27,217
Copper?

745
01:46:28,619 --> 01:46:34,319
The torpedoes used for special sea attacks
have been duds. Upon investigation...

746
01:46:34,425 --> 01:46:38,384
...it was because aluminum was
used for the main fuse.

747
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:43,031
We don't have enough copper
to make the electrical circuits.

748
01:46:43,134 --> 01:46:49,232
We asked Headquarters, but they could
only give us 1/16 of the needed amount.

749
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:55,301
We can't just send the young men of the
suicide forces out to die in vain. Any ideas?

750
01:46:57,381 --> 01:46:58,279
It's Yamashita, entering.

751
01:46:58,449 --> 01:47:00,417
Yeah.

752
01:47:05,823 --> 01:47:09,486
Ah...

753
01:47:09,594 --> 01:47:11,562
Thanks.

754
01:47:14,298 --> 01:47:19,258
Copper... you can find
it all over the place.

755
01:47:21,105 --> 01:47:27,510
Wherever a bomb's hit, you can find electric
lines buried everywhere in the rubble.

756
01:47:27,612 --> 01:47:30,513
Copper electric lines are 99% pure.

757
01:47:32,583 --> 01:47:36,542
If we dug them up, we could salvage
a considerable amount.

758
01:47:39,557 --> 01:47:44,654
I see. In that case,
get on it immediately.

759
01:47:45,096 --> 01:47:49,760
Acknowledged.

760
01:47:49,867 --> 01:47:52,358
By the way, old man...

761
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:54,438
...the citizens are exhausted.

762
01:47:56,407 --> 01:48:02,368
If the war is going to continue, then
something drastic needs to be done.

763
01:48:04,715 --> 01:48:08,207
His Majesty the Emperor must
directly lead the nation.

764
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:12,278
He must live in the same way as the citizens
and the soldiers, and fight along with them.

765
01:48:14,225 --> 01:48:20,892
Even the Meiji Emperor went to Hiroshima
during the Russo-Japanese War.

766
01:48:20,998 --> 01:48:26,959
We're all suffering, and yet His Majesty
stays cloistered in the Imperial Palace?

767
01:48:29,473 --> 01:48:31,202
Don't say such things.

768
01:48:34,945 --> 01:48:36,845
Yes sir.

769
01:48:54,298 --> 01:48:56,596
That's not copper! It's no good. Next!

770
01:48:56,767 --> 01:48:58,735
Hey, hey... why don't you
give her something.

771
01:49:00,738 --> 01:49:02,603
Okay.

772
01:49:02,773 --> 01:49:07,335
If you need more workers, you could
get some prisoners released.

773
01:49:07,445 --> 01:49:09,242
I'll put them to good use, you'll see.

774
01:49:09,413 --> 01:49:11,472
That's a good idea.

775
01:49:11,582 --> 01:49:16,679
Anyway, Mr. Seki-ne, your assistance with
the transportation has been very helpful.

776
01:49:16,787 --> 01:49:19,381
As a result, I won't let His
Excellency Onishi down.

777
01:49:19,757 --> 01:49:24,126
Even a gambler such as myself can contribute
to his country. I'm grateful for the chance.

778
01:49:24,228 --> 01:49:31,031
But look, Mr. Kodama. if the Navy needs
help from gamblers, the future isn't rosy.

779
01:49:33,003 --> 01:49:35,528
It's only the citizens who are suffering.

780
01:49:35,639 --> 01:49:39,541
Government administrators and senior
statesmen aren't suffering at all.

781
01:49:39,643 --> 01:49:42,612
That's the problem.

782
01:49:45,116 --> 01:49:48,381
Could you use something like this?

783
01:49:53,724 --> 01:49:59,663
That's a fine Kan'non statue. Young lady,
you should take good care of it.

784
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:06,167
This is the last of my family's things.
Please use it to make ammunition or whatever you need.

785
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:08,738
Please.

786
01:50:08,906 --> 01:50:14,674
Young lady, keep the statue. We'll weigh
your good intentions instead.

787
01:50:14,845 --> 01:50:20,010
I don't want any money.
But how is the war going?

788
01:50:20,184 --> 01:50:23,517
Don't worry. The war will end soon.

789
01:50:23,687 --> 01:50:26,656
It'll end, while we're losing?

790
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:39,663
You people... you are all men! How
could you speak so irresponsibly?

791
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:45,731
What have we all been fighting for?!

792
01:50:48,612 --> 01:50:51,581
I may be a woman,
but even I want revenge...

793
01:50:57,788 --> 01:51:04,751
Young lady, we're sorry. He only said
that because he felt bad for you.

794
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:13,466
Not one of us accepts the idea of losing
the war. I intend to die before it is over.

795
01:51:13,571 --> 01:51:15,539
Please believe in us.

796
01:51:20,377 --> 01:51:22,345
Take cover!
Take cover!

797
01:51:31,388 --> 01:51:34,357
Damn you bastards...
come down here!

798
01:51:39,196 --> 01:51:40,891
Mr. Seki-ne! Are you okay?

799
01:51:41,065 --> 01:51:42,191
Are you hit?

800
01:51:42,366 --> 01:51:49,169
Man, what a surprise.
My balls have shrunk!

801
01:51:49,273 --> 01:51:52,242
If it's broken, my woman will cry.

802
01:51:58,349 --> 01:52:03,582
He's worried about his balls at a time like
this. The guy's got nerves of steel!

803
01:52:03,754 --> 01:52:06,689
Hey boss. If you're so worried,
why don't you stroke it and see?

804
01:52:07,491 --> 01:52:09,459
Yeah.

805
01:52:11,362 --> 01:52:14,331
Oh. It's fine!

806
01:52:19,036 --> 01:52:24,906
Meanwhile, day by day, Japan's economy
was nearing collapse.

807
01:52:25,009 --> 01:52:27,569
Not only was the nation running
out of war machines and fuel...

808
01:52:27,678 --> 01:52:31,273
...but even saltpeter, a key ingredient
of gunpowder, was in short supply.

809
01:52:31,382 --> 01:52:37,343
The necessities of life were available
only in the black-market.

810
01:52:37,454 --> 01:52:43,654
Fearing that this ruinous state of affairs
would soon result in a descent into anarchy...

811
01:52:43,928 --> 01:52:46,055
...senior statesmen such
as Kono-e Fumimaro...

812
01:52:46,163 --> 01:52:50,896
...made appeals to the Emperor,
and maneuvered to end the war.

813
01:52:52,269 --> 01:52:57,969
Prime Minister Suzuki, supported by Foreign
Minister Togo and Navy Minister Yonai...

814
01:52:58,075 --> 01:53:05,004
...asked the Soviet Union, which was neutral
towards Japan, to act as an intermediary...

815
01:53:05,115 --> 01:53:08,278
...but instead, the Soviet Union declared
it was abrogating their treaty.

816
01:53:08,652 --> 01:53:11,314
Soviet diplomatic responses
were uniformly vague.

817
01:53:11,488 --> 01:53:20,487
Meanwhile, the military authorities assumed
that an invasion would precede any peace.

818
01:53:20,698 --> 01:53:26,159
However, the resources available
to mount a defense...

819
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:29,171
...could only be described
as pitifully inadequate.

820
01:53:29,673 --> 01:53:36,772
At the time, these were the weapons
provided to the citizen's militia.

821
01:53:37,648 --> 01:53:41,607
Have a look. He's an example of the
reservists assigned to our unit.

822
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:51,125
These folks don't have full uniforms.
We have neither guns nor swords for them.

823
01:53:51,228 --> 01:53:57,394
They have no changes of clothes,
so their underwear is infested with lice.

824
01:53:57,501 --> 01:54:03,133
All they've been eating are daikon-
radish leaves and potato vines.

825
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:06,300
They're falling down sick left and right
from malnutrition and sleep-deprivation.

826
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:10,642
This is the fact of the matter.

827
01:54:10,748 --> 01:54:18,621
Chief of Staff... are you going to order
these people to fight the Americans?

828
01:54:18,722 --> 01:54:22,681
Navy Headquarters ordered the
activation of the reservists.

829
01:54:22,793 --> 01:54:26,251
Those orders specified what they should be
paid and how they should be equipped.

830
01:54:26,363 --> 01:54:27,853
What else can we do?

831
01:54:28,499 --> 01:54:31,593
Kozono. I truly understand
what you are saying.

832
01:54:31,702 --> 01:54:34,603
However, we need you all
to endure a little longer.

833
01:54:34,705 --> 01:54:37,435
The enemy will soon land
here on the mainland.

834
01:54:37,541 --> 01:54:41,341
At this time, we're preparing
for a decisive battle.

835
01:54:41,445 --> 01:54:46,382
We've increased production, and we're
stockpiling equipment and provisions.

836
01:54:46,483 --> 01:54:50,351
No matter what Headquarters
says, when the time comes...

837
01:54:50,454 --> 01:54:55,756
...I will personally make sure you
get everything you need.

838
01:54:55,859 --> 01:55:02,822
Your troops are essential to me. Believe
in sure victory, and tough it out for now.

839
01:55:05,169 --> 01:55:07,228
Entering.

840
01:55:13,177 --> 01:55:15,338
Commander Kozono.
Atsugi called.

841
01:55:15,446 --> 01:55:18,142
Navy General Staff Vice Director Onishi
has gone there to inspect the base.

842
01:55:18,315 --> 01:55:21,113
Oh, that's right. Nakai.

843
01:55:21,285 --> 01:55:22,149
Yes sir.

844
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:24,947
I'm flying out from Takeyama,
go get me a plane.

845
01:55:25,122 --> 01:55:27,090
Yes sir.

846
01:55:28,926 --> 01:55:34,887
It's been chilled at 3,000 meters,
so it should be a suitable temperature.

847
01:55:39,169 --> 01:55:42,229
Let's give it a try.

848
01:55:54,485 --> 01:56:00,515
It's nicely chilled. Atsugi's definitely
the place for beer.

849
01:56:00,691 --> 01:56:08,655
Come here for a drink anytime. But I also
want you to hear what I've got to say.

850
01:56:11,535 --> 01:56:18,839
Your Kagoshima accent's going
to turn our beer bitter.

851
01:56:19,009 --> 01:56:21,807
Sorry everyone, but could you
please give us some privacy?

852
01:56:21,979 --> 01:56:23,947
Yes sir.

853
01:56:35,959 --> 01:56:42,194
Guy who came back from Shanghai told me that
there's a rumor floating around there...

854
01:56:42,299 --> 01:56:50,263
...that the Japanese government is asking the
Soviets to mediate for us. Is this true?

855
01:56:59,183 --> 01:57:04,246
I don't have all the facts,
but it's probably true.

856
01:57:04,354 --> 01:57:08,120
They're not even considering
continuing the war.

857
01:57:08,225 --> 01:57:11,820
What are the top brass panicking about?

858
01:57:11,929 --> 01:57:17,526
And what happens when our men,
who risk their lives every day, learn of this?

859
01:57:17,634 --> 01:57:19,602
They might revolt!

860
01:57:23,674 --> 01:57:26,643
I went to the port depot
to argue my case.

861
01:57:26,743 --> 01:57:30,873
But when it comes to properly using
the reservists, and war strategy...

862
01:57:30,981 --> 01:57:33,950
...the old guard aren't
giving it their all.

863
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:39,953
We'll never win the war with
such flaky leadership.

864
01:57:40,057 --> 01:57:48,192
Vice Director Onishi, let me tell you face
to face. I'm against suicide attacks.

865
01:57:48,298 --> 01:57:53,964
It's not a path to sure victory.
Isn't it a path to sure defeat?

866
01:57:54,071 --> 01:58:04,276
If every person from the Navy, Army, and the
nation fights with everything they've got...

867
01:58:04,381 --> 01:58:07,942
...we could win, without having
to resort to suicide attacks.

868
01:58:08,051 --> 01:58:12,545
That's the only path we've
got toward peace.

869
01:58:26,436 --> 01:58:30,031
It's as you say.

870
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:34,099
The young men are the only ones who
are seriously fighting the Americans.

871
01:58:35,812 --> 01:58:42,149
Certainly, it's possible that suicide attacks
might not have been the path to victory.

872
01:58:42,252 --> 01:58:49,215
However, if we weren't so totally committed,
our country couldn't rise to the challenge.

873
01:58:52,896 --> 01:59:01,099
If we fight on to the bitter end, our true
character will be revealed to all.

874
01:59:01,204 --> 01:59:05,607
The people will truly understand
what it means to be Japanese.

875
01:59:05,709 --> 01:59:12,672
Only then can we be sure that the next
generation will follow the right path.

876
01:59:14,217 --> 01:59:21,180
If we agree to peace now, the nation of Japan
will have learned nothing from this war.

877
01:59:24,361 --> 01:59:29,355
The young men making suicide attacks
are sacrifices for this cause.

878
01:59:29,533 --> 01:59:37,030
Yes sir, it is as you say, Vice Director.
I've overstepped my bounds.

879
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:39,108
Please forgive me.

880
01:59:43,613 --> 01:59:48,380
No... I understand your point of view.

881
01:59:48,485 --> 01:59:54,446
The time will probably come when I'll be needing
your help. Until then, look after yourself.

882
01:59:56,193 --> 02:00:00,152
Soldiers must do their very best within
the confines of military law.

883
02:00:02,032 --> 02:00:07,197
If you step outside that, you'll only
bring misfortune upon yourself.

884
02:00:07,371 --> 02:00:15,335
Yes sir. I, Kozono, am yours
to command, Vice Director.

885
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:50,469
Hey...

886
02:00:50,647 --> 02:00:51,875
Yes sir.

887
02:00:52,049 --> 02:00:53,516
Is that Kaida's mistress?

888
02:00:53,683 --> 02:00:56,652
No, she's been his fiancee
since his school days.

889
02:01:01,825 --> 02:01:03,952
Yes sir.

890
02:01:18,408 --> 02:01:23,107
Your hair's grown longer since
the last time I saw you.

891
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:28,381
Come on, do guys really pay that
much attention to such details?

892
02:01:28,552 --> 02:01:33,512
Of course. Because each time I
see you could be the very last.

893
02:01:34,424 --> 02:01:37,484
Hey, foxy.

894
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:40,459
This is what you call "a swan
in a garbage dump"?

895
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:45,932
Kaida, this is inexcusable! Why didn't you
tell us that you've got such a fine wife?

896
02:01:46,103 --> 02:01:51,302
Hey, slow down. She's not my wife.

897
02:01:51,408 --> 02:01:54,536
She's the younger sister of a friend from
middle school. Show some respect.

898
02:01:55,112 --> 02:01:58,309
No excuses. Enough with
your little tryst here.

899
02:01:58,415 --> 02:02:00,645
Let's go to the gun-room and have
a grand reception. Right?

900
02:02:00,817 --> 02:02:02,409
Come on, escort her.

901
02:02:02,586 --> 02:02:03,848
Please, this way.

902
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:04,782
Mr. Yoshinori?

903
02:02:04,955 --> 02:02:06,354
Come on, come on.

904
02:02:06,523 --> 02:02:08,491
You've been captured by riff-raff.

905
02:02:10,327 --> 02:02:10,986
Please, come in.

906
02:02:11,161 --> 02:02:13,288
Please.

907
02:02:13,463 --> 02:02:15,988
Come in.

908
02:02:16,166 --> 02:02:17,565
Here, please come in, Missus.

909
02:02:17,734 --> 02:02:19,702
Please.

910
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:23,135
Now Missus, this is where you sit.

911
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,606
Hey Kaida! You come and sit right here.

912
02:02:25,775 --> 02:02:27,743
Hurry up!

913
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:34,314
Leave us alone. We don't
want all this fun.

914
02:02:34,484 --> 02:02:39,387
Endure it. We'll leave you alone
after the wedding party.

915
02:02:39,556 --> 02:02:43,925
Wedding party? Quit kidding around.

916
02:02:44,094 --> 02:02:49,464
We're not kidding.
This is for real! Listen up.

917
02:02:49,566 --> 02:02:53,093
You and Miss Terumi absolutely
must get married!

918
02:02:53,203 --> 02:02:56,366
So, with that in mind, look at this.

919
02:03:00,210 --> 02:03:02,804
Cut the crap!

920
02:03:02,913 --> 02:03:08,408
You're making light of
a big life-decision.

921
02:03:08,585 --> 02:03:14,148
But you two are seeing each other, hoping
that you'll eventually get married, right?

922
02:03:14,324 --> 02:03:17,293
I won't get married while
I'm a fighter pilot.

923
02:03:18,795 --> 02:03:25,758
Think about it. What'll happen
to her after I die?

924
02:03:28,071 --> 02:03:36,445
She's only 20. She'll be a widow at
20. It's cruel to even think about it.

925
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:39,376
So what if you're a fighter pilot,
it doesn't mean you're going to die!

926
02:03:39,549 --> 02:03:45,385
Love is a moment by moment thing. You're
a hypocrite to worry about the future!

927
02:03:45,555 --> 02:03:47,352
Stop your meddling!
This is private!

928
02:03:47,524 --> 02:03:53,485
Hey Missus. No matter what he says, would
you at least accept our good wishes?

929
02:03:55,031 --> 02:03:57,397
It's fine by me...

930
02:03:57,500 --> 02:04:01,732
Miss Terumi, what are you saying?

931
02:04:01,905 --> 02:04:08,868
Okay then, we're on. The shrine is small,
but it'll still be a Shinto wedding.

932
02:04:08,979 --> 02:04:10,446
Everyone, let us be solemn!

933
02:04:10,614 --> 02:04:12,582
Okay, sit down!

934
02:04:20,423 --> 02:04:28,262
Okay, for this couple: Navy First Lieutenant
Kaida Yoshinori and Sada Terumi...

935
02:04:28,365 --> 02:04:32,324
...we shall hold a temporary
wedding reception.

936
02:04:33,536 --> 02:04:37,495
We can't quite do the traditional three exchanges
of nuptial cups, so please bear with us.

937
02:04:44,547 --> 02:04:48,074
What kind of look is that?!
Get over yourself already!

938
02:04:48,251 --> 02:04:51,220
Come on, Missus. You've got
to look happier than that.

939
02:05:09,105 --> 02:05:11,073
Go ahead, Missus.

940
02:05:59,656 --> 02:06:03,752
<i>Silver wings in formation...</i>

941
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:12,097
<i>At the front lines in the South...</i>

942
02:06:12,202 --> 02:06:16,070
<i>...vigilant sea-eagles guard.</i>

943
02:06:16,172 --> 02:06:24,045
<i>We are the ammunition of flesh
that destroys enemy forces.</i>

944
02:06:24,147 --> 02:06:31,986
<i>We are the glorious Rabaul Air Corps...</i>

945
02:06:32,088 --> 02:06:40,086
<i>Our Navy spirit burns with bravado.</i>

946
02:06:40,196 --> 02:06:47,967
<i>To the South, we see the shining sun.</i>

947
02:06:48,171 --> 02:06:51,274
<i>We defeat the enemy in the clouds...</i>

948
02:06:51,274 --> 02:06:53,276
Mission accomplished.
<i>We defeat the enemy in the clouds...</i>

949
02:06:53,276 --> 02:06:54,577
<i>...And on the waves.</i>
Good.

950
02:06:56,112 --> 02:07:03,314
<i>We are the glorious Rabaul Air Corps.</i>

951
02:07:03,453 --> 02:07:06,415
(Onishi is writing down the names
of dead special attack soldiers)

952
02:08:02,645 --> 02:08:08,709
Chief. The enemy has landed at Leyte;
They're consolidating their position.

953
02:08:08,885 --> 02:08:12,218
Shouldn't we stop launching
suicide missions now?

954
02:08:15,325 --> 02:08:24,358
The Grumman's are pounding our airfields.
If we engage them, we get shot down.

955
02:08:24,467 --> 02:08:29,063
We're short on equipment, and the
skill-level of our current pilots...

956
02:08:29,172 --> 02:08:38,080
...makes them easy prey for the enemy.
They're pitiful. Just pitiful.

957
02:08:38,181 --> 02:08:46,145
As a leader, it's one of my duties to find
beautiful ways for my men to die.

958
02:08:46,256 --> 02:08:48,656
We will continue the attacks.

959
02:08:48,758 --> 02:08:55,163
I believe that this shows the love
we have for our young men.

960
02:09:57,493 --> 02:10:02,453
Hey... Listen up.

961
02:10:05,168 --> 02:10:09,127
I'm not going to kill you.
I'm letting you go.

962
02:10:12,642 --> 02:10:18,842
So fly to my mom on my behalf. Okay?

963
02:10:18,948 --> 02:10:21,644
I'm asking this of you.

964
02:10:21,818 --> 02:10:27,779
Pilots assemble!
Pilots assemble!

965
02:10:45,775 --> 02:10:51,941
"My dearest mother. I, Tsuyoshi,
am finally going off to fight.

966
02:10:52,048 --> 02:10:58,578
"I have only one regret... that I must
leave my warm and loving mother...

967
02:10:59,956 --> 02:11:03,289
"...without repaying the
great debt I owe her.

968
02:11:03,393 --> 02:11:09,525
"Please only praise me for sacrificing
my life for the sake of the Empire.

969
02:11:09,699 --> 02:11:11,667
"My dearest mother...

970
02:11:12,902 --> 02:11:17,771
"Though I, Tsuyoshi will die, my spirit
will continue to endeavor for the Empire.

971
02:11:20,443 --> 02:11:26,848
"Please do not grieve for me. I, Tsuyoshi,
am happy to be part of this glorious act.

972
02:11:26,949 --> 02:11:29,918
"This is what a warrior lives for!

973
02:11:30,019 --> 02:11:38,358
"My dearest mother... Please
live a long and happy life.

974
02:11:38,461 --> 02:11:43,262
"I, Tsuyoshi, will embrace your
photograph in my heart.

975
02:11:43,366 --> 02:11:47,359
"And thus! And thus will
I die a worthy death!

976
02:11:47,470 --> 02:11:49,438
"-Day of attack: Tsuyoshi."

977
02:14:00,636 --> 02:14:03,070
This is Tsuchida, entering.

978
02:14:03,239 --> 02:14:05,207
Alright, come in.

979
02:14:07,176 --> 02:14:10,145
Vice Director, Boss Kodama
is on the telephone.

980
02:14:24,827 --> 02:14:28,490
Yes. Connect me...

981
02:14:28,598 --> 02:14:30,122
Hello. It's me.

982
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:35,760
We got some important information,
so I'm calling to let you know.

983
02:14:37,306 --> 02:14:42,141
The Soviet Union is finally massing
troops in Russian-Manchuria.

984
02:14:42,245 --> 02:14:44,645
Supposedly there's over
a million of them.

985
02:14:44,747 --> 02:14:50,583
In addition, they aren't equipped
for winter operations.

986
02:14:50,686 --> 02:14:59,390
Because of this, a faction in the Army
has decided to support peace...

987
02:14:59,495 --> 02:15:04,489
...at tomorrow's Supreme War
Guidance Conference.

988
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:09,469
It seems to be Yonai's faction
that's pushing for this.

989
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:15,499
I see. Thanks.

990
02:15:34,163 --> 02:15:38,532
June, 1945. The Soviet Union
has conquered Germany.

991
02:15:38,634 --> 02:15:42,035
Using over 1.5 million troops,
4,900 fighter planes...

992
02:15:42,138 --> 02:15:47,508
...and 3,700 tanks, they launched their
invasion of Russian-Manchuria.

993
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:53,947
At the secret Yalta conference, the US promised
Sakhalin island and the Kuriles to Russia...

994
02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:58,783
...in return for declaring
war on Japan.

995
02:16:00,022 --> 02:16:05,483
Thus the Soviet Union, which was waiting
for the perfect moment to declare war...

996
02:16:05,594 --> 02:16:10,725
...delayed acting on the request to help
negotiate a peace agreement...

997
02:16:10,833 --> 02:16:14,064
...that had been advocated by Former Foreign
Ambassador Hirota and Ambassador Sato.

998
02:16:29,986 --> 02:16:32,955
Please wait until we are graced by
the presence of His Majesty.

999
02:16:51,273 --> 02:16:55,505
Cabinet Minister, I have come
to make a request.

1000
02:16:55,611 --> 02:17:03,814
Please advise His Majesty to never, to never,
adopt a path to peace. I implore you.

1001
02:17:03,986 --> 02:17:08,013
Mr. Onishi. You are not authorized
to enter this room.

1002
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:12,752
Japan will win. We shall assuredly win.

1003
02:17:12,862 --> 02:17:19,028
Another 20 million special attackers, just
20 million more, would guarantee victory!

1004
02:17:19,168 --> 02:17:20,726
Get out.

1005
02:17:20,903 --> 02:17:26,671
If we all, as a group,
put our heads together...

1006
02:17:26,776 --> 02:17:31,406
...we shall, without a doubt, develop
a new plan. I too will think on this.

1007
02:17:31,514 --> 02:17:33,709
Please give us some time.

1008
02:17:33,883 --> 02:17:35,510
GET OUT!

1009
02:17:35,684 --> 02:17:37,914
Mr. Yonai...

1010
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:45,927
Though Mr. Onishi isn't a member of the cabinet,
I believe he has a right to express his opinion.

1011
02:17:46,028 --> 02:17:53,662
In the time before the Emperor arrives,
why don't we hear what he's got to say?

1012
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:03,178
Mr. Toyoda...

1013
02:18:07,983 --> 02:18:10,850
Come with us.

1014
02:18:22,198 --> 02:18:24,166
Mr. Onishi...

1015
02:18:26,235 --> 02:18:30,569
if you've got something to say, then speak
privately to me, the Cabinet Minister.

1016
02:18:30,673 --> 02:18:34,632
It's most imprudent of you
to come barging in here.

1017
02:18:35,878 --> 02:18:38,312
What did you bring that sword for?

1018
02:18:38,414 --> 02:18:40,382
What's that sword doing here?!

1019
02:18:43,919 --> 02:18:46,888
How dare you come to the
palace looking like that!

1020
02:18:49,992 --> 02:18:55,055
Vice Director Onishi. Apologize
for your insolence.

1021
02:18:55,164 --> 02:18:58,133
Then say what you want to say.

1022
02:19:06,642 --> 02:19:08,610
Please pardon me.

1023
02:19:11,747 --> 02:19:19,313
I... merely... want the Cabinet
Minister to reconsider.

1024
02:19:24,059 --> 02:19:26,027
Let me be frank with you.

1025
02:19:29,298 --> 02:19:33,496
The decision to make peace... has
been made by His Majesty.

1026
02:19:35,304 --> 02:19:38,000
It's not that I don't understand
your perspective.

1027
02:19:38,107 --> 02:19:41,907
But I will not allow you to interfere
in political matters.

1028
02:19:42,077 --> 02:19:45,205
I am well aware of that.

1029
02:19:45,314 --> 02:19:47,475
However, Cabinet Minister...

1030
02:19:47,583 --> 02:19:52,782
To honor the heroic souls of the thousands
who have fallen on the field of battle...

1031
02:19:52,888 --> 02:19:57,325
...at the very least... let peace
come after a victory.

1032
02:19:58,527 --> 02:20:02,395
To placate the souls of heroes,
we launch suicide attacks.

1033
02:20:02,498 --> 02:20:07,458
And to placate those new heroic souls,
we would have to launch even more.

1034
02:20:10,372 --> 02:20:14,331
It would be an endless cycle...
of death and destruction.

1035
02:20:16,011 --> 02:20:19,344
But we must still do it.

1036
02:20:19,448 --> 02:20:24,715
It is not a matter of how many die.
What I am talking about is spirit.

1037
02:20:26,188 --> 02:20:32,093
We must honor the spirit of the Japanese people,
who have shed so much blood, to the very end.

1038
02:20:33,562 --> 02:20:36,531
War is waged in the real world!

1039
02:20:39,501 --> 02:20:43,437
Spiritual arguments...

1040
02:20:43,539 --> 02:20:46,508
...cannot intrude on the conduct
of international politics.

1041
02:20:48,644 --> 02:20:51,374
Even now...

1042
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:53,971
...in one region of the country...

1043
02:20:54,083 --> 02:20:57,450
...there are reports of starvation
and chaos.

1044
02:20:57,553 --> 02:21:00,886
How do you expect us to fight on?

1045
02:21:00,990 --> 02:21:03,618
I arranged for you to join
the Naval General Staff...

1046
02:21:03,726 --> 02:21:06,695
...because I believed you
were a pragmatic man.

1047
02:21:08,530 --> 02:21:12,057
But perhaps my judgment was wrong.

1048
02:21:12,835 --> 02:21:14,803
Cabinet Minister...

1049
02:21:16,872 --> 02:21:22,833
We all knew that this war was an impossible
one, even before we started it.

1050
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:29,383
We all knew that our steel production and
oil supplies were inferior to America's.

1051
02:21:31,453 --> 02:21:37,119
The premise of the war was illogical, and
now we're trying to resolve it logically.

1052
02:21:37,226 --> 02:21:40,195
It's a betrayal to the people
of the nation.

1053
02:21:43,065 --> 02:21:44,692
Furthermore...

1054
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:48,998
...in the constitution set down
by the Meiji Emperor...

1055
02:21:49,104 --> 02:21:54,064
...and in military law, the word
"surrender" does not appear.

1056
02:21:55,978 --> 02:21:58,879
Our front-line soldiers fought to
the last man believing in that.

1057
02:21:58,981 --> 02:22:02,940
They chose the path of suicide over
the shame of being taken captive.

1058
02:22:04,486 --> 02:22:10,914
If the Imperial decision
is to choose peace...

1059
02:22:11,026 --> 02:22:17,955
...it would betray the souls of the
generals and soldiers who died in battle.

1060
02:22:18,067 --> 02:22:22,470
You are urging... His Majesty
to take the wrong path.

1061
02:22:22,638 --> 02:22:29,305
Do you desire the death and destruction of
the hundred-million people of our nation?

1062
02:22:29,478 --> 02:22:32,447
I am speaking of our accountability
as a nation.

1063
02:22:37,419 --> 02:22:39,387
Of course, the living are important.

1064
02:22:40,923 --> 02:22:43,892
But we also must think of the souls
of those who have died.

1065
02:22:43,992 --> 02:22:49,362
Otherwise we shirk our
national responsibility.

1066
02:22:49,465 --> 02:22:51,592
Cabinet Minister...

1067
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:54,567
...do you feel nothing...

1068
02:22:54,670 --> 02:22:57,104
...towards the souls of the
special attackers?!

1069
02:22:57,272 --> 02:22:59,240
Such insolence!

1070
02:23:00,409 --> 02:23:04,277
I, as Cabinet Minister...

1071
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:07,349
...do not let my personal feelings
affect political decisions!

1072
02:23:14,156 --> 02:23:17,125
Cabinet Minister... Director...
please take your seats.

1073
02:23:40,582 --> 02:23:46,020
The government's decision to seek peace
was decided upon in that meeting.

1074
02:23:46,121 --> 02:23:47,884
But it was already too late.

1075
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:54,486
As Ambassador Sato waited,
the Soviet leaders continued to stall.

1076
02:23:54,596 --> 02:23:58,191
In the meantime, on July 16, the Potsdam
Declaration, an ultimatum to Japan...

1077
02:23:58,300 --> 02:24:03,294
...was drawn up by the leaders of
the US, Great Britain, and China.

1078
02:24:03,572 --> 02:24:10,944
That same day, the US detonated the world's
first atomic bomb in a desert in New Mexico.

1079
02:24:11,046 --> 02:24:13,571
As they no longer needed Soviet
participation in the war...

1080
02:24:13,682 --> 02:24:16,412
...they wanted complete control
over Japanese territory.

1081
02:24:16,518 --> 02:24:21,478
The Soviets sought to occupy Manchuria,
Hokkaido, and the Kurile islands.

1082
02:24:21,723 --> 02:24:26,092
Their struggle for control of the corpse
of the Japanese Empire...

1083
02:24:26,195 --> 02:24:30,097
...was the opening battle in
the US and Soviet Cold War.

1084
02:24:30,199 --> 02:24:35,000
The Potsdam Declaration, which demanded
Japan's unconditional surrender...

1085
02:24:35,103 --> 02:24:40,735
...was announced on July 26th by
the US, Great Britain, and China.

1086
02:24:40,843 --> 02:24:45,303
Meanwhile, the government, still hoping
for Soviet mediation on Japan's behalf...

1087
02:24:45,414 --> 02:24:49,043
...had to placate extremists such
as Vice Admiral Onishi...

1088
02:24:49,151 --> 02:24:53,611
...and so the Prime Minister declared that
the Potsdam Declaration would be "ignored."

1089
02:24:54,623 --> 02:24:58,115
But the Americans wanted Japan to surrender
before the Soviets entered the war...

1090
02:24:58,227 --> 02:25:03,722
...so they unilaterally interpreted
"ignore" to mean rejection.

1091
02:25:04,066 --> 02:25:12,303
They immediately launched a B29 from
Tinian island to drop the atomic bomb.

1092
02:25:36,231 --> 02:25:41,498
As soon as they learned that the Americans had
dropped an atomic bomb, the Soviet Union...

1093
02:25:41,603 --> 02:25:46,768
...immediately declared war on Japan,
and invaded Manchuria.

1094
02:25:47,743 --> 02:25:50,735
The Soviet entry into the war meant that
the Americans needed to force Japan...

1095
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:57,080
...to immediately surrender, and so the
atomic bomb was used a second time.

1096
02:25:57,786 --> 02:26:01,517
As there was now no hope of negotiating
a peace, early on August 9th...

1097
02:26:01,623 --> 02:26:07,255
...the Emperor informed the government
that he had decided to accept...

1098
02:26:07,362 --> 02:26:11,264
...the Potsdam Declaration, and the government
immediately sent a telegram to the Allies...

1099
02:26:11,366 --> 02:26:14,358
...acknowledging their acceptance
of unconditional surrender.

1100
02:26:14,836 --> 02:26:19,466
"The order to cease fire...
the order to disarm...

1101
02:26:19,575 --> 02:26:24,376
"These despicable orders are an
attempt to destroy the Emperor!"

1102
02:26:24,479 --> 02:26:26,947
"Having lost faith in assured victory...

1103
02:26:27,049 --> 02:26:33,010
"...the government and the senior officers
have committed high treason...

1104
02:26:33,121 --> 02:26:37,683
"...and have therefore forfeited their
authority to give us orders."

1105
02:26:37,793 --> 02:26:43,493
"Therefore, we hereby declare that we will
reject any and all of their commands!"

1106
02:26:43,665 --> 02:26:46,794
You bastard!
"Japan is God's..."

1107
02:26:48,003 --> 02:26:51,131
Did you actually send that
telegram to all the bases?

1108
02:26:51,306 --> 02:26:58,610
Of course. The Army Command Center in Shiba,
Commander Koga of the submarine forces...

1109
02:26:58,714 --> 02:27:01,308
...the Army Air Corps in Tokorozawa
and Sayama...

1110
02:27:01,416 --> 02:27:06,547
...and Major Masuda's tank force
have responded positively.

1111
02:27:06,722 --> 02:27:12,854
This is absurd. This is a declaration of
a coup d'état. Come to your senses!

1112
02:27:13,629 --> 02:27:18,589
Chief... From what you have
said, I believe that...

1113
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:23,933
...you are absolutely opposed to accepting
the Potsdam Declaration.

1114
02:27:24,039 --> 02:27:28,203
All of us here at Yokosuka should take
this opportunity to stand together...

1115
02:27:28,310 --> 02:27:31,973
...and declare to the government that
we will resolutely continue the war!

1116
02:27:32,147 --> 02:27:34,980
Kozono, calm down!

1117
02:27:35,150 --> 02:27:40,782
The Emperor has made his decision.
It's our duty to obey Imperial commands.

1118
02:27:40,956 --> 02:27:43,925
It is you who has to think calmly.

1119
02:27:45,527 --> 02:27:50,464
Surrendering is a sinister plot hatched
by the Emperor's aides!

1120
02:27:50,632 --> 02:27:51,433
Not true!

1121
02:27:51,433 --> 02:27:54,129
Not true! Our "statesmen"
are selling the country out!

1122
02:27:54,302 --> 02:27:57,032
Kozono...

1123
02:27:59,975 --> 02:28:06,005
His Majesty has said that he can no longer
bear to see his people suffer.

1124
02:28:06,114 --> 02:28:10,813
We have three months of rice.
We're out of fuel.

1125
02:28:10,919 --> 02:28:13,444
The production of planes
has ground to a halt.

1126
02:28:13,555 --> 02:28:16,991
Where do you think we'll get what
we need to continue the war?

1127
02:28:17,592 --> 02:28:23,895
Chief. Have you lost your mind?!

1128
02:28:23,999 --> 02:28:26,866
Only just recently,
you told us to hang on...

1129
02:28:26,968 --> 02:28:31,996
...to keep the faith, and that we had
ample equipment and provisions.

1130
02:28:32,107 --> 02:28:36,009
You were the one who inspired us...

1131
02:28:36,111 --> 02:28:41,481
...you said that when the time came, you'd
lead us, no matter what orders we got.

1132
02:28:41,583 --> 02:28:47,852
If what you said was a lie, then you...
you are a despicable coward!

1133
02:28:48,557 --> 02:28:53,961
Fine. If you are going to obey the
government's orders no matter what...

1134
02:28:54,062 --> 02:28:58,362
...you should take responsibility for having
led Japan into its present misfortunes...

1135
02:28:58,467 --> 02:29:01,868
...and all of you should
commit suicide!

1136
02:29:01,970 --> 02:29:05,235
If you do that, I could return to my unit
and convince my subordinates to stand down.

1137
02:29:05,407 --> 02:29:10,276
Obey your orders. If not,
we will suppress you by force!

1138
02:29:10,579 --> 02:29:16,381
Orders be damned! The Atsugi Air Corps will
take independent action from now on!

1139
02:29:16,551 --> 02:29:18,109
Bastard!

1140
02:29:18,286 --> 02:29:20,516
First Lieutenant Nakai! You'd better
think about what you're doing.

1141
02:29:20,689 --> 02:29:23,021
Go back to your unit and tell
them to stop fooling around.

1142
02:29:23,191 --> 02:29:25,125
What do you mean, "fooling around"?

1143
02:29:25,227 --> 02:29:28,754
We've sacrificed everything for this war!
How can we just give up now?!

1144
02:29:28,864 --> 02:29:30,331
And you call yourselves
professional soldiers?!

1145
02:29:30,499 --> 02:29:32,967
That's enough.

1146
02:29:33,068 --> 02:29:39,530
Up until yesterday, you boasted to your
men about your faith in victory.

1147
02:29:39,641 --> 02:29:42,940
Day goes by, and you
turn completely around.

1148
02:29:43,044 --> 02:29:47,071
You quitters are no longer our peers,
no longer comrades in arms!

1149
02:29:47,182 --> 02:29:51,141
You are our enemies!
Farewell!

1150
02:30:00,095 --> 02:30:02,063
Commander?

1151
02:30:04,266 --> 02:30:06,501
Shit.
You have a terrible fever.

1152
02:30:06,668 --> 02:30:11,628
It's Malaria. I had a bout of it in Rabaul.

1153
02:30:13,542 --> 02:30:18,104
Shit... This is bad timing.

1154
02:30:18,980 --> 02:30:23,314
August 12th: the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs receives...

1155
02:30:23,418 --> 02:30:27,115
...the American response
to Japan's surrender.

1156
02:30:27,222 --> 02:30:29,213
The requirements for disarmament...

1157
02:30:29,324 --> 02:30:33,488
...and subordination of the Emperor to
the Allied Supreme Commander...

1158
02:30:33,595 --> 02:30:35,654
...strengthens the cause of the
extremist military faction.

1159
02:30:35,764 --> 02:30:37,493
Secretary-Generals Toyoda and Umezu...

1160
02:30:37,599 --> 02:30:40,796
...demanded a conference to discuss
the American response...

1161
02:30:40,902 --> 02:30:45,669
...but Prime Minister Suzuki and Foreign
Minister Togo insisted that it was unnecessary.

1162
02:30:45,774 --> 02:30:48,743
As a result, progress towards a cease-fire
agreement becomes stalled.

1163
02:30:50,278 --> 02:30:57,241
Vice Admiral Onishi and others develop
a final plan to continue the war.

1164
02:31:04,226 --> 02:31:09,027
The cabinet had been in continuous
session for two days.

1165
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:12,099
As night fell on the second day,
they still had not reached a consensus.

1166
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:43,019
Vice Director Onishi is here. He would
like to see the Secretary-General.

1167
02:31:43,999 --> 02:31:46,729
Have him come in.

1168
02:32:24,005 --> 02:32:28,908
I heard you went to see Prince
Takamatsu-no-miya.

1169
02:32:37,085 --> 02:32:42,045
The prince does not think as we do.

1170
02:32:44,693 --> 02:32:50,928
He said that in as much as His Majesty
has no confidence in the military...

1171
02:32:51,032 --> 02:32:54,991
...unless there is a plan for assured victory,
he would not act as our emissary to him.

1172
02:32:57,672 --> 02:33:00,300
He admonished me thus.

1173
02:33:07,482 --> 02:33:12,510
For the military to win His
Majesty's confidence...

1174
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:15,418
...we must present him with a
plan that guarantees victory.

1175
02:33:15,523 --> 02:33:18,492
There is no other way to
get him to reconsider.

1176
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:30,528
One more month... if we can continue
to fight for one more month...

1177
02:33:30,638 --> 02:33:34,597
...I believe that we will come
up with a good plan.

1178
02:33:36,144 --> 02:33:41,104
I too will think upon this with
the utmost seriousness.

1179
02:33:42,684 --> 02:33:49,647
We need only one more month...
will this be possible?

1180
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:03,967
Minister of Foreign Affairs... is
there anything you can do?

1181
02:34:04,139 --> 02:34:10,601
We would have rejected the Potsdam
Declaration if we had a good plan.

1182
02:34:10,712 --> 02:34:17,811
The question is, is there
such a brilliant move?

1183
02:34:17,986 --> 02:34:25,950
Mr. Onishi is talking about finding
a way out of a fatal predicament.

1184
02:34:27,896 --> 02:34:32,890
I have a good understanding
of everyone's points of view.

1185
02:34:33,001 --> 02:34:38,268
As to whether we should try to get some
concessions from the Americans...

1186
02:34:38,373 --> 02:34:48,339
...I'm afraid that our only option is to
petition His Majesty to make the decision.

1187
02:34:56,991 --> 02:35:01,724
Prime Minister. Enemy air attack!
Please go to the shelter.

1188
02:35:01,896 --> 02:35:04,865
Your Excellency, please hurry.
Secretary-General.

1189
02:35:34,362 --> 02:35:36,330
Vice Director Onishi...

1190
02:35:44,472 --> 02:35:52,436
Chief Secretary... can we not
come up with any ideas?

1191
02:35:54,182 --> 02:36:00,143
Isn't there any way... that
we could win the war?

1192
02:36:04,159 --> 02:36:13,227
Vice Director. Every avenue has been
exhausted. All that remains...

1193
02:36:13,334 --> 02:36:18,294
...is for you to rein in the rebellious
faction of the Navy staff, isn't that so?

1194
02:36:21,576 --> 02:36:27,537
I see. So you too think that way.

1195
02:36:29,717 --> 02:36:34,677
But how... how do I restrain them?

1196
02:36:37,559 --> 02:36:46,524
What is the way of defeat that will satisfy those
who have survived, and those who have died?

1197
02:36:51,940 --> 02:36:53,908
Mr. Sakomizu.

1198
02:36:58,279 --> 02:37:06,243
This war... did not start because
the people wanted it.

1199
02:37:08,790 --> 02:37:12,749
It's a war of nations.

1200
02:37:13,695 --> 02:37:17,529
It's a war of nation against nation...

1201
02:37:17,632 --> 02:37:21,591
...which means that it is a war between
the leaders of nations.

1202
02:37:24,439 --> 02:37:32,346
Until now, hasn't Japan fought
to the bitter end?

1203
02:37:35,250 --> 02:37:44,852
If His Majesty the Emperor himself
stood on the battlefield...

1204
02:37:44,959 --> 02:37:52,058
...along with the cabinet ministers, the
staff officers, and all our men...

1205
02:37:52,166 --> 02:37:58,730
...all of us attacking the enemy
with everything we've got...

1206
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:02,799
isn't that the only way defeat
could be endured?

1207
02:38:05,013 --> 02:38:10,974
To opt for peace or not, that's a decision
to be left for the civilians who remain.

1208
02:38:12,654 --> 02:38:21,619
I believed there would be a final battle, and
that is why I deployed the suicide troops.

1209
02:38:23,898 --> 02:38:30,565
The young men of the special attack forces
believed this too. That's why, that's why...

1210
02:38:30,672 --> 02:38:36,633
...they went gladly... to their deaths!

1211
02:38:40,315 --> 02:38:42,283
Mr. Sakomizu...

1212
02:38:44,285 --> 02:38:51,248
How many men, do you think,
died in the suicide attacks?

1213
02:38:53,094 --> 02:38:59,055
Two Thousand Six Hundred men.
Two Thousand Six Hundred!

1214
02:39:02,303 --> 02:39:05,067
To those men...

1215
02:39:05,173 --> 02:39:08,700
To those men...

1216
02:39:08,810 --> 02:39:13,770
Who will go to those men to tell
them that we've been defeated?

1217
02:39:41,776 --> 02:39:47,612
At 10:00 AM the next day, August 14th,
the second Imperial Council was held.

1218
02:39:47,715 --> 02:39:52,743
The Emperor stated that in order to explain
Japan's unconditional surrender...

1219
02:39:52,854 --> 02:39:56,483
...he himself would speak to
the people of the nation.

1220
02:39:56,591 --> 02:39:59,458
As the attendees were overcome
with tears of gratitude...

1221
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:05,192
...the decision to end the Pacific War, which
had lasted 3 years and 8 months, was made.

1222
02:40:07,268 --> 02:40:12,228
Your Majesty...
I implore you.

1223
02:40:13,541 --> 02:40:20,572
Please continue the war. I implore you.

1224
02:40:20,681 --> 02:40:24,777
Please continue the war.

1225
02:42:24,539 --> 02:42:30,444
Confections given to us by His Majesty.
There's one for each of us.

1226
02:42:54,936 --> 02:43:01,899
It was I who had you sent
to the Philippines.

1227
02:43:03,477 --> 02:43:13,443
I, Yonai, know what's in your heart
better than anyone else.

1228
02:43:16,457 --> 02:43:26,093
As a military man, you have well-founded
reasons for your principles.

1229
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:29,101
However...

1230
02:43:30,938 --> 02:43:38,902
...the day had to come, when someone
had to say the war must end.

1231
02:43:43,451 --> 02:43:48,411
If... not just the Americans...

1232
02:43:51,158 --> 02:43:54,616
...but the Soviets also invade
the homeland...

1233
02:43:54,729 --> 02:43:59,996
...Japan would get partitioned,
just like Germany was.

1234
02:44:00,101 --> 02:44:04,060
And if that happened...

1235
02:44:07,608 --> 02:44:11,066
...then the national spirit of the people, of
which you speak, would also become divided.

1236
02:44:11,178 --> 02:44:16,138
Maybe each side would get
turned against the other.

1237
02:44:17,284 --> 02:44:21,243
Indeed...

1238
02:44:23,924 --> 02:44:26,893
...surrendering is against
the principles...

1239
02:44:30,297 --> 02:44:35,257
...of our national policy since the
time of the Meiji restoration.

1240
02:44:44,011 --> 02:44:49,972
Perhaps His Majesty's decision
is not the correct one.

1241
02:44:52,586 --> 02:44:55,555
But now...

1242
02:44:58,159 --> 02:45:03,119
...the issue isn't whether His Majesty,
one man, has made a mistake.

1243
02:45:09,303 --> 02:45:15,264
Our priority is to save 60 million
citizens. I'm sure you agree.

1244
02:45:26,721 --> 02:45:38,622
I ask you to accept today's Imperial
Decision as a voice from heaven.

1245
02:45:42,236 --> 02:45:50,200
But if you insist on continuing
to fight, no matter what...

1246
02:45:53,114 --> 02:45:59,075
...you will give me no choice
but to kill you.

1247
02:46:05,860 --> 02:46:08,829
I understand.

1248
02:46:11,465 --> 02:46:17,426
I will... give up.

1249
02:46:27,248 --> 02:46:32,151
Come... Let's partake of them.

1250
02:47:49,063 --> 02:47:51,031
It's over.

1251
02:47:54,068 --> 02:47:59,504
However, the war of the Atsugi
Air Corps was not over.

1252
02:48:00,374 --> 02:48:04,538
Hinomaru Number Eleven, fly to Kisazaru!
Hinomaru Number Eleven, fly to Kisarazu!

1253
02:48:04,645 --> 02:48:06,977
Ten enemy Grumman's are bombarding.

1254
02:48:09,617 --> 02:48:11,585
Roger!

1255
02:48:15,589 --> 02:48:22,518
That day was the final day of combat
for Japan's Naval Air Corps.

1256
02:48:58,299 --> 02:49:01,234
Kaida! Pull up! Bring your nose up!

1257
02:50:14,108 --> 02:50:16,076
Kurashima!

1258
02:50:22,049 --> 02:50:27,954
Kurashima! Bail out!
Bail out now!

1259
02:50:45,205 --> 02:50:48,572
<i>We, reflecting profoundly on
the state of the world...</i>

1260
02:50:48,675 --> 02:50:52,111
<i>...and the prevailing condition
of our empire...</i>

1261
02:50:52,212 --> 02:50:58,447
<i>...have decided that extraordinary measures
are required to effect a settlement...</i>

1262
02:50:58,552 --> 02:51:03,387
<i>...and hereby announce to our
good and loyal subjects...</i>

1263
02:51:03,490 --> 02:51:05,890
<i>...that we have ordered our government
to communicate to the governments...</i>

1264
02:51:05,993 --> 02:51:11,431
<i>...of the United States, Great Britain,
China, and the Soviet Union...</i>

1265
02:51:11,532 --> 02:51:18,961
<i>...that our empire accepts the provisions
of their Joint Declaration.</i>

1266
02:51:19,073 --> 02:51:29,415
<i>The security and well-being of the people, and
the prosperity and happiness of the world...</i>

1267
02:51:29,583 --> 02:51:32,552
Don't listen to this shit!

1268
02:51:34,721 --> 02:51:42,218
<i>...Fate has now dictated that we must bear
the unbearable and endure the unendurable.</i>

1269
02:51:42,329 --> 02:51:46,493
<i>Now we must work for peace on behalf
of the generations yet to come.</i>

1270
02:51:47,134 --> 02:51:51,571
<i>We will always be with you, and will work
diligently to preserve the nation...</i>

1271
02:51:51,672 --> 02:51:57,975
<i>...and our heart is gladdened by
your sincerity and goodwill.</i>

1272
02:51:58,612 --> 02:52:03,675
<i>We caution you in the strongest terms
to treat each other with sincerity...</i>

1273
02:52:03,784 --> 02:52:12,158
<i>...and to accept the tide of events, lest
we lose the confidence of the world.</i>

1274
02:52:12,259 --> 02:52:18,220
<i>Let the entire nation work together as one
family, from generation to generation...</i>

1275
02:52:18,332 --> 02:52:21,130
<i>...ever confident that the nation
will endure for all eternity...</i>

1276
02:52:21,235 --> 02:52:24,693
<i>...but also mindful of our grave responsibilities
and the long and difficult road ahead.</i>

1277
02:52:24,805 --> 02:52:28,935
<i>Come together and devote yourselves
to rebuilding the nation...</i>

1278
02:52:29,042 --> 02:52:32,011
<i>...cultivate moral rectitude...</i>

1279
02:52:34,348 --> 02:52:39,308
Vice Director Onishi... where are you?!

1280
02:52:40,587 --> 02:52:43,556
Commander. Commander!

1281
02:52:54,067 --> 02:52:58,731
Commander, the broadcast
is finished. Shall I...

1282
02:52:58,906 --> 02:53:01,602
No, I'll do the talking.

1283
02:53:01,775 --> 02:53:06,508
Commander! You can't. Hey,
bring me a microphone.

1284
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:08,147
Yes sir!

1285
02:53:16,123 --> 02:53:21,618
All of you, stay at your stations and
listen. This is Kozono speaking.

1286
02:53:21,728 --> 02:53:26,665
You just heard the words
of His Majesty!

1287
02:53:29,670 --> 02:53:36,633
Japan has finally accepted the Potsdam
Declaration, and surrendered.

1288
02:53:38,545 --> 02:53:43,505
Because of this, I acknowledge that the
Japanese military is to be disbanded.

1289
02:53:45,152 --> 02:53:50,283
So now, we begin a war of defense...

1290
02:53:50,390 --> 02:53:57,125
...each of us, as regular citizens,
defending our home soil!

1291
02:53:57,231 --> 02:54:01,861
Gentlemen! Each of you is free
to decide whether or not...

1292
02:54:01,969 --> 02:54:05,234
...you will fight on.

1293
02:54:05,339 --> 02:54:12,905
Therefore, those of you who will fight
with me and continue the war...

1294
02:54:13,013 --> 02:54:20,943
...remain in your units. Those who
do not, return to your homes.

1295
02:54:21,054 --> 02:54:27,857
I believe in assured victory, and will
keep on fighting no matter what!

1296
02:54:27,961 --> 02:54:29,588
Over and out.

1297
02:54:29,763 --> 02:54:30,731
Yeah! Let's do it!

1298
02:54:30,731 --> 02:54:36,260
Yeah! Let's do it! I'm going to
Kasumi'ga'ura to get me a plane.

1299
02:54:36,370 --> 02:54:38,133
Come with me if you want!

1300
02:54:38,272 --> 02:54:42,072
I'm going to Kisarazu.
Who'll come with me?!

1301
02:54:42,242 --> 02:54:45,040
Who'll go get ammo from
the depot in Yokosuka?

1302
02:54:45,212 --> 02:54:47,180
Let's go!

1303
02:55:30,123 --> 02:55:32,091
Boss...

1304
02:55:54,147 --> 02:55:56,381
How bad is the wound?
Sir...

1305
02:55:56,483 --> 02:56:02,945
He slit his stomach in a straight line,
then stabbed his own throat.

1306
02:56:03,123 --> 02:56:04,590
When?

1307
02:56:04,758 --> 02:56:09,718
I heard the groans at dawn,
then saw what had happened.

1308
02:56:31,718 --> 02:56:33,686
"Uncle..."

1309
02:56:35,789 --> 02:56:40,749
It's me, Kodama.

1310
02:56:55,175 --> 02:56:57,143
Hey...

1311
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:10,413
I kept my promise to my men.

1312
02:57:11,992 --> 02:57:18,090
I know. I know it well!

1313
02:57:18,198 --> 02:57:20,758
Uncle, I know how you feel.

1314
02:57:20,867 --> 02:57:22,835
I know it very well.

1315
02:57:30,544 --> 02:57:35,504
Do not act as my second.

1316
02:57:38,585 --> 02:57:45,548
Tell the military doctor there
to go downstairs.

1317
02:57:47,194 --> 02:57:56,159
I want... I want to suffer as long
as possible before I die.

1318
02:58:03,076 --> 02:58:07,706
His heart is unusually strong.

1319
02:58:07,814 --> 02:58:11,045
I believe it will take several
more hours.

1320
02:58:22,929 --> 02:58:26,797
I've put you through much hardship.

1321
02:58:26,900 --> 02:58:33,328
Thank you for being there
for me, all this time.

1322
02:58:36,643 --> 02:58:39,771
Uncle...

1323
02:58:39,880 --> 02:58:41,848
I'm disappointed in you!

1324
02:58:44,684 --> 02:58:47,653
I believed that you'd always
be in good health!

1325
02:58:49,256 --> 02:58:54,592
I was looking forward to fighting MacArthur
when they land, together, with you!

1326
02:58:54,694 --> 02:58:58,653
I've kept machine guns
and grenades ready!

1327
02:59:02,035 --> 02:59:07,996
Now... my dream is gone.

1328
02:59:12,479 --> 02:59:14,447
I'm going to join you.

1329
02:59:16,316 --> 02:59:18,284
Moron!

1330
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:34,223
You won't be worth shit if you're dead.

1331
02:59:36,570 --> 02:59:43,533
I called you here because I've
got things for you to do.

1332
03:00:25,418 --> 03:00:30,549
Mr. Kodama... Mr. Kodama...

1333
03:00:32,592 --> 03:00:37,552
Go to Atsugi and get Kosono
under control.

1334
03:00:40,166 --> 03:00:46,002
Tell him to stop his rash
and blind acts...

1335
03:00:46,106 --> 03:00:49,075
...tell him I said so.

1336
03:00:58,351 --> 03:01:02,685
Also...

1337
03:01:02,789 --> 03:01:08,728
...the prisoners of war... those
that have survived...

1338
03:01:08,828 --> 03:01:15,791
...they can come back
to Japan some day.

1339
03:01:23,143 --> 03:01:32,984
But those who turned to bones on
foreign soil... can't come back...

1340
03:01:33,086 --> 03:01:39,821
...so think about what
you can do for them.

1341
03:01:41,761 --> 03:01:51,727
His Majesty the Emperor will give
it careful consideration, I'm sure.

1342
03:01:55,575 --> 03:02:04,540
We'll entrust it to His Majesty's noble heart,
and the hearts of the Japanese people.

1343
03:02:07,120 --> 03:02:12,080
I will bear witness to it.

1344
03:02:37,817 --> 03:02:41,747
This car always gets a flat. Hurry!
Yes sir.

1345
03:03:26,866 --> 03:03:29,801
First:

1346
03:03:29,903 --> 03:03:36,467
Soldier's primary duty is
to be completely loyal.

1347
03:03:37,143 --> 03:03:42,103
Those who are born in our nation...

1348
03:03:43,516 --> 03:03:50,479
...must have hearts that are willing
to sacrifice themselves.

1349
03:03:52,325 --> 03:04:01,100
Indeed, a strong and loyal heart...
Kozono! Listen carefully!

1350
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:03,870
...Is the true measure of a soldier.
Kozono! Listen carefully!

1351
03:04:03,870 --> 03:04:05,672
...Is the true measure of a soldier.
I am Teraoka of the Third Air Fleet.

1352
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:10,300
The man you're waiting for,
Vice Director Onishi...

1353
03:04:10,410 --> 03:04:13,146
...has cut his belly and died.

1354
03:04:13,146 --> 03:04:16,115
...Has cut his belly and died.
...honing his skills.

1355
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:27,926
Surely you must know why Onishi
chose the path of suicide.

1356
03:04:28,027 --> 03:04:32,430
Onishi choked back his tears and gave
up his dream of continuing the war.

1357
03:04:32,532 --> 03:04:40,769
He chose death, hoping that his
death would end your rebellion.

1358
03:04:40,874 --> 03:04:45,834
Can't you honor his last wish?

1359
03:04:48,882 --> 03:04:54,752
All the other soldiers that rose up
have now ended their rebellion.

1360
03:04:54,854 --> 03:04:57,823
You can protest all you want, but you
can't reverse the tide all by yourself.

1361
03:05:01,561 --> 03:05:04,792
Commander... Commander!

1362
03:05:04,898 --> 03:05:09,335
Everyone here has decided to accept
Vice Admiral Teraoka's position.

1363
03:05:09,435 --> 03:05:12,404
I am giving the command to stand
down on my own responsibility.

1364
03:05:15,174 --> 03:05:21,875
Kozono. You've been relieved of duty
as a Commander since the 16th.

1365
03:05:21,981 --> 03:05:28,910
The young men that are following your orders
will be tried for treason if they continue.

1366
03:05:31,391 --> 03:05:36,294
Treason? You're right about that!

1367
03:05:37,730 --> 03:05:42,690
I shall purge the traitors
who defile God's land!

1368
03:05:50,543 --> 03:05:54,172
Vice Director Onishi, where are you?

1369
03:05:54,347 --> 03:05:56,315
Calm down!

1370
03:05:58,217 --> 03:06:00,879
I, Kozono, will rescue you!

1371
03:06:01,054 --> 03:06:03,022
Calm down!

1372
03:06:05,191 --> 03:06:07,159
Vice Director Onishi!

1373
03:06:13,633 --> 03:06:15,601
Calm down!

1374
03:06:17,537 --> 03:06:20,506
Calm down, damn you!

1375
03:06:25,712 --> 03:06:26,713
Call the military doctor.

1376
03:06:26,713 --> 03:06:28,181
Call the military doctor.
Yes sir.

1377
03:06:28,181 --> 03:06:31,750
Bring a sedative.
Yes sir.

1378
03:06:33,152 --> 03:06:35,950
Release the Commander!
Release him, or we won't let you out!

1379
03:06:36,122 --> 03:06:38,090
Fools!

1380
03:06:42,328 --> 03:06:47,288
If you're going to disobey orders,
cut my head off first.

1381
03:06:49,135 --> 03:06:50,103
Nakai.

1382
03:06:50,103 --> 03:06:52,264
Nakai.
Executive Officer!

1383
03:06:52,438 --> 03:06:56,340
Executive Officer. The guys in the gun room
are trying to escape by plane!

1384
03:06:56,509 --> 03:06:58,704
What?!

1385
03:07:09,789 --> 03:07:11,757
Move.

1386
03:07:15,595 --> 03:07:18,359
Kaida, wait! Listen to me! Calm down!

1387
03:07:18,531 --> 03:07:19,999
Talk is futile.

1388
03:07:19,999 --> 03:07:21,967
Talk is futile.
Calm down!

1389
03:07:27,373 --> 03:07:29,170
Hurry!

1390
03:07:29,475 --> 03:07:34,742
Kaida! Don't go! That's an order!
Don't die! Don't die!

1391
03:07:34,914 --> 03:07:38,680
Kaida, calm down!
Kaida!

1392
03:07:39,385 --> 03:07:41,216
Missus...

1393
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:44,084
Kaida!

1394
03:07:44,190 --> 03:07:47,626
He's at the airfield.
Hurry!

1395
03:07:47,727 --> 03:07:50,594
Missus...

1396
03:09:12,879 --> 03:09:16,440
Captain Arai... Kurashima...

1397
03:09:18,651 --> 03:09:22,052
Long live the Emperor...

1398
03:09:22,155 --> 03:09:24,123
Ten Thousand Years!

1399
03:09:31,864 --> 03:09:36,631
The rebel officers that flew to Atsugi
were captured and court-matialed.

1400
03:09:36,836 --> 03:09:40,772
Each was given several
years of prison time.

1401
03:09:40,873 --> 03:09:45,674
Captain Kozono was admitted to Nobi
Navy Hospital in Fujisawa...

1402
03:09:45,778 --> 03:09:51,182
...and the uprising at Atsugi Air
Corps was finally quelled.

1403
03:09:51,284 --> 03:09:59,248
On this day, the vanguard of the US
occupation forces landed in Atsugi.

1404
03:10:02,061 --> 03:10:04,029
Nurse...

1405
03:10:06,866 --> 03:10:08,834
Nurse.

1406
03:10:10,703 --> 03:10:13,672
Will you please bring
me a drink of water?

1407
03:10:22,949 --> 03:10:24,917
Here you go.

1408
03:10:51,043 --> 03:10:53,534
Somebody help!
Emergency!

1409
03:10:56,415 --> 03:10:58,383
This way... Hey, this way!

1410
03:10:59,919 --> 03:11:02,046
Right, this way!

1411
03:11:04,056 --> 03:11:06,718
Gentlemen!

1412
03:11:06,892 --> 03:11:09,122
He's up there!

1413
03:11:11,364 --> 03:11:18,065
We surrendered... Because the
cowardly cabinet ministers...

1414
03:11:18,170 --> 03:11:23,665
...fearing for their lives...

1415
03:11:23,776 --> 03:11:29,612
...tricked His Majesty the Emperor...
And made him give up!

1416
03:11:30,349 --> 03:11:35,116
Get down from there!
Get down!

1417
03:11:35,621 --> 03:11:37,589
Gentlemen!

1418
03:11:39,425 --> 03:11:44,385
Now is the time for us
to renew the nation!

1419
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:51,800
The surrender must be a sign to us...

1420
03:11:51,904 --> 03:11:59,868
...that we must all unite, purge
the corrupt politicians...

1421
03:12:01,681 --> 03:12:06,641
...and prosecute the war
as private citizens!

1422
03:12:12,825 --> 03:12:17,785
Your Majesty the Emperor...
Please hear my words.

1423
03:12:20,900 --> 03:12:25,200
You have erred.

1424
03:12:25,304 --> 03:12:31,402
The war was originally declared
by your own words.

1425
03:12:33,446 --> 03:12:38,884
Why now have you surrendered?

1426
03:12:39,352 --> 03:12:42,515
What the hell!
Bastard!

1427
03:12:47,393 --> 03:12:49,088
Bastards!

1428
03:12:49,195 --> 03:12:51,629
You bastards!
Bastards!

1429
03:12:51,731 --> 03:12:56,930
Who do you think that man is?!
He's been fighting for all of you!

1430
03:12:57,036 --> 03:13:03,373
He's Captain Kozono of the Atsugi Air Corps!
Who are you to throw stones at him?!

1431
03:13:03,976 --> 03:13:05,944
Your Majesty the Emperor!

1432
03:13:07,580 --> 03:13:10,606
You are...

1433
03:13:10,716 --> 03:13:12,684
...you are to be pitied!

1434
03:13:15,821 --> 03:13:18,790
You do not realize your own error!

1435
03:13:22,328 --> 03:13:24,296
You are to be pitied!

1436
03:13:57,963 --> 03:14:01,956
The Vice Director's mansion, where Vice
Admiral Onishi committed suicide...

1437
03:14:02,301 --> 03:14:08,638
...still stands at Nanpeidai, near
Shibuya Station in Tokyo.

1438
03:14:19,585 --> 03:14:28,516
Though 29 years ago, one heartbroken soldier
took his own life, here in this room...

1439
03:14:28,627 --> 03:14:31,596
...today, that event has
been totally forgotten.

1440
03:17:35,114 --> 03:17:42,885
"To the heroic souls of the special attack
forces I say, you have fought well.

1441
03:17:42,988 --> 03:17:45,354
"You have my deep gratitude.

1442
03:17:45,457 --> 03:17:47,982
"You exploded into glory as ammunition
of flesh, believing in final victory.

1443
03:17:48,093 --> 03:17:55,090
"However, in the end, your faith
did not result in victory.

1444
03:17:55,200 --> 03:18:03,630
"I will atone to the heroic souls of my men, and
to their bereaved families, by my own death.

1445
03:18:03,742 --> 03:18:10,875
"Next, as I die, I say to all young men that
rash acts only give advantage to the enemy.

1446
03:18:10,983 --> 03:18:22,360
"Follow imperial instructions, and behave
with prudent perseverance. Such is my wish.

1447
03:18:22,461 --> 03:18:28,400
"Endure, and do not forget your
dignity as Japanese people.

1448
03:18:28,500 --> 03:18:32,095
"All sons are national treasures.

1449
03:18:32,204 --> 03:18:37,801
"Let them victoriously maintain the spirit
of special attacks, even in times of peace.

1450
03:18:37,910 --> 03:18:40,435
"Endeavor to do your utmost to promote
the well-being of the Japanese people...

1451
03:18:40,546 --> 03:18:46,507
"...and work for peace and harmony
with all of humanity."
