00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,218
JAKE: Are you guys
ready for this?

2
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,253
BILLY: Yes, yes.

3
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,655
Here it comes!

4
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,857
Oh! Oh! Oh! (CHUCKLES)

5
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,359
(LAUGHING)

6
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,028
Oh my God! That's so weird.
GUNDERSON: Oh!

7
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,196
Oh!

8
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,099
Wow. Why don't we
hang out more often?

9
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,701
I told you he can still do it.
I told you. All right.

10
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,071
Yes, you can vomit without
finger penetration.

11
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,238
You're a freak of nature.

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Thank you. You must be
so proud of yourself.

13
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,575
You say that like
it's no big deal.

14
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,710
Oh, you must be so... That's
not easy to do by the way.

15
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,379
That actually burned more than
I thought it would.

16
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,513
BILLY: That was amazing.
GUNDERSON: Yeah.

17
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,048
BILLY: Ah!
Here he is.

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,650
ALL: Rocks!

19
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,286
GUNDERSON: It's a time
warp BILLY: Yeah!

20
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,768
ROCKS: Hey, we can let go,
we don't...

21
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,190
GUNDERSON: How are you doing?
JAKE: Oh, God.

22
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,192
Look at this we're getting the
band back together. This is weird.

23
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,426
This is weird, but us.

24
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,028
Holy shit, all right!

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,465
Welcome to my final
day in New York City.

26
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,301
So, if you'll just
follow me, it begins.

27
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,302
GUNDERSON: Here we go.
JAKE: All right.

28
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,903
Hey!
All right.

29
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,039
BILLY: Yes. Yeah.
Did you burn your legs out?

30
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,474
Whoo! Let's go
guys! Yeah!

31
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:51,516
Hey, what'd you think about
to make yourself throw up?

32
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,345
Uh, the future.

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,750
Oh!

34
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,709
Are you gonna tell him?

35
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,090
Tell me what?

36
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,791
It sucks. Maybe
I'll just bail.

37
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,393
Bail? Bail on
what, Billy?

38
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,462
BILLY: You don't
think I should?

39
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,097
You don't think I should? Guys, what
the hell are you talking about?

40
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,598
GUNDERSON: You don't wanna go
to work, don't go to work.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,833
Whoa! Work?
You're kid...

42
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,002
Today? You shitting me?
I have to go.

43
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,537
Come on. No, no, no.

44
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,172
Look, like, yesterday, my
partner cornered me at the...

45
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,974
At the firm and he said because
we have this... Not today.

46
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,416
It's just gonna be
like, for an hour.

47
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,445
All right. Ready?
Hold on. Hold on.

48
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,047
Three, two, one, go. Go!

49
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,017
Oh! Not even close.

50
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,352
Not even close.

51
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,187
Oh!

52
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,222
I wasn't looking.
Did you see?

53
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,458
I'm sorry, ladies, are you
missing a little boy?

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,860
Okay... Is this
little boy yours?

55
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,595
Okay.
He's not yours?

56
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,730
He's just following us. We
don't know whose he is.

57
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,798
I have to pee.

58
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,067
Oh, God I have to pee.

59
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,536
Could be a different city.
Correct. Yeah.

60
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,972
So, even if you're clothed when
you have an erection Exactly.

61
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,140
Yes.
that's out and greasy.

62
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:30,142
Okay.
Up to two is this?

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,460
JAKE: All right. All right.
Time to start drinking.

64
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,307
Wanna make a toast.

65
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,988
260 blocks, the entire
length of Manhattan,

66
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,528
my final day in the city, so...

67
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,763
To one last great adventure.

68
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,532
Okay, just real quick.

69
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,334
Does it have to be last?
How about another?

70
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,768
Sure.
You got it.

71
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,170
Really? Wait a second, you
know what, how about...

72
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,204
It's his toast.
Let him have his toast.

73
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,939
Another in the long series of...

74
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,874
All right, fine. In a
long series of adventure.

75
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,277
(STAMMERS) Maybe just...
How about one?

76
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,845
To coming and semen.

77
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,447
You got it.
I like it.

78
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,515
I'll drink to that. To
coming and semen. Yeah.

79
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,451
And all the joy they provide.

80
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,920
ROCKS: Yeah? Yeah.

81
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,388
Oh wow!

82
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,956
Did you hold up?

83
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,038
It's like, it's like giving
head to a fine gentleman.

84
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,526
(CHUCKLES)

85
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,528
Give me that.
BILLY: All right.

86
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,810
Ah!

87
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,266
Careful.
Okay.

88
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,567
All right.

89
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,235
We gotta get moving, guys,

90
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,637
this island's not gonna walk itself.
260 blocks.

91

(CAR HORNS BLARING)

92
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,219
JAKE: All right, now is
as good a time as any.

93
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,921
A robber walks into your house.
ALL: Oh.

94
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,590
That's what I'm talking about.
Robber walks into your house,

95
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,375
he puts a gun to your head,

96
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,159
says,<i> Sophie's Choice,</i> you gotta pick
one or I'll shoot you in the face.

97
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,729
All right.
Option one is...

98
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,297
This is just occurring to
me, but why is he a robber?

99
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,299
Uh, you meet the love of your life...
I mean, what's he robbing?

100
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,900
You of your time. This woman is perfect.
She's like.

101
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,769
An 11 out of 10.

102
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,937
All right. She got this incredible
body and the sex is great.

103
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,173
Intelligent. Is that
intelligent sex?

104
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,342
Don't worry about it,
you're never gonna have it.

105
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,344
I'm gonna go on. All right, so
time comes in the relationship,

106
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,646
about six months in...

107
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,015
Where it's time to
meet her family, okay?

108
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,017
So you all decide to go away
to a little county house,

109
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,752
just you and her and her folks,

110
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,020
for about two weeks.

111
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,022
But you all share one bathroom.

112
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,957
That's important.
All right, now

113
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,519
for the entire time you're there,
remember, two weeks, long time.

114
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,595
Every time you have
to take a shit,

115
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,265
you do it...
(CLEARS THROAT)

116
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,470
You have to take
a shit in the bathtub.

117

(CHUCKLES)

118
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,373
All right, okay.
Boom!

119
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,676
Okay, all right, wait I'll tell you
what I'd do. I would just hold it in.

120
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,211
You can't.
You can't hold it in.

121
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,146
Why not.
Firstly, it's impossible.

122
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,215
Secondly, it's
against the rules.

123
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,885
And thirdly after you leave
that dookie in the bathtub,

124
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,520
you have to deny it forever.

125
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,402
You can never say that it was you.
Wow.

126
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,858
BILLY: Is this a museum?

127
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,294
ROCKS: Well, that ends the
relationship, so fine.

128
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,896
Not necessarily, I mean, remember,
this is like, the perfect woman,

129
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,531
so she might forgive you

130
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,900
BILLY: Got it. Shit down the drain.
Shit down the drain.

131

GUNDERSON:
Geez, Billy.

132
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,137
BILLY: What? I'm just trying to understand
the parameters of the scenario.

133
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,638
ROCKS: What's
option number two?

134
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,307
JAKE: Uh, right.

135
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,476
Option two.
Okay, so...

136
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,411
For the next year,
starting tomorrow,

137
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,747
everywhere you go, you,

138
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,383
and only you are responsible
for taking two cars.

139
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,884
(CHUCKLES)

140
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,806
So, the logistics...
(MAN SHUSHES)

141
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,995
Uh, so think about it.

142
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,991
If you need to go to work,
then you need to drive there,

143
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,494
then you have to somehow get
back, walk or cab or something.

144
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,429
And then you have to take
another car, then you're there.

145
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,897
Can you...
No, you can't walk.

146
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,499
Can... And no you can't
take the subway.

147
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,034
Okay? You can't tow the car. You
can't get a ride. Nothing like that.

148
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,536
Okay.
Uh...

149
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,171
What kind of gas
mileage do these get?

150
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,606
What is the matter with you?

151
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,841
How do you clothe and
feed yourself seriously?

152
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,476
How are you such an asshole?

153
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,245
Practice.
Okay.

154
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,113
Yeah? All right. I,
okay option two is

155
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,615
take two cars and...

156
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,384
Option one is fortnight of
in-law bathtub shitting.

157
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,619
Yeah. Okay.
Not even a question.

158
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,020
I'm gonna go option two.

159
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,088
Uh.
Take the two cars...

160
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,856
Why is that not a question?

161
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,558
'Cause I can't even imagine
what Emma's parents would do.

162
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,093
I don't even wanna see it. Yeah.

163
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,128
If I was to shit
in their bathtub.

164
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,197
It's true and she shouldn't forgive you.
Nightmare.

165
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,365
No.
Shouldn't...

166
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,300
Where is your sense of romance?

167
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,068
I mean this is the love of
your life we're talking about.

168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,904
Yeah but the love of your
life should leave you

169
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,605
if you defecate in the bathtub.

170
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,742
You're... Don't knock
freestyle defecation, man.

171
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,977
Okay, so that's
what you would do.

172
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,079
You're a bathtub, bathtub kinda guy?
I'm not knocking it

173
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,614
I just wanna be honest about it.

174
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,749
I'm just... I'm not You
don't have to lie about it

175

playing this game

176
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,351
I find it childish and silly.

177
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,887
(CHUCKLES)

178
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,688
Classic Gunderson.

179
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,161
Do they have museums in Ohio?
Oh fuck.

180
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,763
(CHUCKLES) Fuck you.

181
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,097
You couldn't help yourself.

182
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,399
No, do you...

183
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,934
This is a dumb question.

184
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,836
Is that a serious question?
What museums are in Ohio?

185
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,871
Uh, the...
WOMAN: Excuse me.

186
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,073
Sorry.
We'll be quiet.

187
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,509
Yeah.
What is wrong with you?

188
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,177
Who? Which one?

189
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,580
Don't put your bare feet
on the bench up like that.

190
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,248
Come on.
She's right.

191
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,816
Put it down.
Sorry. Sorry.

192
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,352
People actually have
to sit there after you.

193
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,354
I got it.
Put your feet down.

194
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,689
I gotta put my socks on.

195
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,290
WOMAN:
It's disgusting.

196
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,493
Okay. You've been moving around

197
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,162
and sitting there like
a child for 10 minutes.

198
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,931
You're just incredibly rude.

199
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,800
Okay, that's called
cognitive dissonance.

200
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,968
Yeah. Ding ding.

201
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,003
I said, excuse me.
Yeah, okay.

202
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,038
And I said that's what
we call cognitive dissonance.

203
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,007
Right, and then I put my sock on.
That's what happened.

204
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,929
So, we've have covered everything.
Come on, Barb.

205
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,677
GUNDERSON: Oh, don't drag
Barbara into this. BILLY: Yeah.

206
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm gonna request that
you boys be thrown out.

207
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,282
No. Wait, wait, no, no, no.

208
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,384
No don't do that.
ALL: No.

209
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,686
Why don't we just step outside.

210
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,322
You me, Tweety Bird there.

211
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,724
Let's take you out
for a nice juicy steak.

212
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,492
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

213
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,693
ROCKS: We're young.
We're flirty.

214
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,729
We're nervous. I'm nervous
around older women.

215
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,532
Because I assume you're
older, I'm not sure.

216
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,867
GUNDERSON: We could all
just have a little fun.

217
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,903
So let me ride the
lightning of your love.

218
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,971
I would definitely get that little
canary to sit on my finger.

219
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,540
Come on.

ALL: Oh!
Shhh!

222
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,711
You're in a museum.
Have some respect.

223
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,746
Excuse me?

00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,848
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES)

225
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,049
You really should
get your feet off there.

226
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,651
Oh, dude.
For real it's disgusting.

227
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,219
How old are you?
She's got a great point.

228
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,954
Really? Okay.
Yeah.

(SHAKING PERMANENT MARKER)

231
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,525
Billy, let me ask
you a question.

232
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,728
Do you have a single independent
thought in that head of yours?

233
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,929
Why are we friends
with you again?

234
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,397
Yeah, why are we even
friends with you again?

235
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,099
GUNDERSON: Come on,
you love me.

236
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,635
I'm an anarchist,
but I'm not a dangerous one.

237
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,904
I don't accept that there's
any order in the cosmos

238
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,106
but I do want the trains to run.

239
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,176
I mean, I'm just looking
at the two of you and...

240
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,579
You do everything he does,
like, you're just...

241
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,449
You're his shadow. I mean why
did you order an egg cream?

242
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,117
What are you intimating?
I love egg creams.

243
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,652
Why else would I order...
Delicious.

244
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,554
Yes, they are delicious. Yeah.
You love egg creams?

245
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,489
Then tell me,
lover of egg creams,

246
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,991
what's in an egg cream?

247
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:27,892
ROCKS: You don't have
to answer that.

248
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,227
What?
No, he does.

249
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,895
What's, what's in an egg cream?

250
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,430
It's fine. All right, all
right I'm gonna tell you.

251
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,233
Okay. First of all
there is chocolate.

252
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,635
Cream.
Chocolate syrup.

253
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,604
Syrup and there are eggs in there.
Seltzer. Seltzer.

254
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,573
ROCKS: Seltzer. Seltzer.
BILLY: And there's Seltzer.

255
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,675
Whole milk... Uh, there's...
You know...

256
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,144
You know what, there are... Who
cares what is in the egg...

257
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,812
I don't...
All that matters

258
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,180
is that they're refreshing
and delicious. Right.

259
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,182
Couldn't agree more.
Okay?

260

(TRAIN WHISTLE SOUNDS)

261
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,714
GUNDERSON: Look no one wants to stop
you from going and helping your dad,

262
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,596
but why are you staying there?

263
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,652
You don't know anything
about rubber and plastic.

264
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,121
JAKE: Ach, what's there to know.
And that's not the point anyway.

265
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,724
The point is that it's a stable
career and that's what I need.

266
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,460
You know what else is stable?
Death. You should try that.

267
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,529
Gee whiz, thanks, buddy. That
makes me feel a whole lot better.

268
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,164
You're welcome.

269
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,232
JAKE: What do you want me to do?
My dad needs me, you know.

270
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,701
He asked for my help
and I'm gonna help him.

271
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,536
If I don't go now,
he's gonna have to sell.

272
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,471
GUNDERSON: I guess I didn't
expect you to give up.

273
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,339
Billy, maybe... Who said
anything about giving up?

274
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,141
My work is still up
at Starving Arts.

275
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,743
You know, like...

276
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,079
I can still paint from
wherever I am, including Ohio.

277
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,681
You know, Tabatha
thinks it's very sweet.

278
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,716
Oh, so you're taking advice
from your ex-girlfriend?

279
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,517
Nice. A friend. A current
friend, as well.

280
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,352
Sure, that's a sound decision.

281
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,555
Jesus, man there's only so many
times I can watch my bank account

282
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,024
fall before zero before
I want to kill myself.

283
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,158
You know, I'm in my thirties...

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,694
And I'm moving into
my dad's basement!

285
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,362
Temporarily, I said.
Temporarily.

286
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,598
Yeah, that's what everyone who moves
into their dad's basement says.

287
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,734
Oh my God! And 30 years
later they murder someone.

Oh, I get it now.
I get it. So obvious.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)
You're gonna miss me.

290

You are.
You're gonna miss me.

292
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,010
Come here. Give me a goodbye kiss.
Huh? No.

293
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,213
Don't touch me. You think our
facial hair is gonna stick together

I don't know how
anyone can do that.

we name him officially.

Yeah, if he's a humongous pussy.

Well, he thought that you were
trying to copy his style.

The whole New York
nostalgia thing.

325

explain it to him.

00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,976
CECE: I saved this one
before he could slice it up.

342
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,100
But not, not before he...

343
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,502
Peed on it.

344
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,105
Excuse me? He what on it?
That's piss?

345
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,876
You're always saying how you
wanted to collaborate with...

346
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,410
Max MacKenze, so...

347
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,946
Now you have.

348
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,854
God, I feel so bad.

349
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,589
He put his paintings
up there specifically

350
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,258
'cause that's where
McKenze got his start.

351
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,100
Really?
Yeah.

352
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,828
We should help him.

353
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,730
GUNDERSON: You can't help a
dead man, as the saying goes.

354
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,098
BILLY: That is not
a saying.

355
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,833
Maybe not in
your limited experience.

356
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,234
Guys, he doesn't want
to go back to Ohio.

357
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,076
I mean, he invited Tabatha.
Why did he do that?

358
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,604
Masochism.

359
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,606
No, he's just looking
for a reason to stay.

360
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,242
I'm been shaming the guy all day.
It hasn't made a dent.

361
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,443
The dude is leaving.

362
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,878
No, we can get him to stay.

363
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,446
Listen, I'm gonna somehow,
I'm gonna skip this

364
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,282
checkup with Emma. Can you
still get out of work, Billy?

365
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,683
Yeah, but you told me not to skip.
I know but

366
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,951
my heart is changed.
No worries.

367
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,286
Done and done.
Okay.

368
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,721
Ooh, and what irrational
foolhardy thing should I do?

369
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,623
You two could stop
the constant bickering.

370
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,758
We're not constantly bickering.

371
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,294
Yes we are.
Okay, okay.

372
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,440
You know what guys,
let's uh... Let's...

373
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,975
Call it a day.
No.

374
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,977
ALL: No, no, no. It's been
great that we got to hang out,

375
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,578
but you're busy, we're all busy.

376
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,947
No, not anymore. No.
No, no, forget it.

377
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,748
It's been taken care of,
let's keep walking.

378
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,283
Got a really good idea, I think
you'll like it. Come on, now, Jake.

379
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,484
Yeah?
Absolutely, come on.

380
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,652
BILLY: Let's do this.

381
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,988
Okay. Come on. Adventure time.

382
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,289
Let's gonna go down memory lane.
You're gonna love it.

383
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,371
All right.

384
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,765
BILLY: It literally looks
exactly the same.

385
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,668
Hey man, thanks again for,
you know, letting us...

386
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,303
Uh, yeah, no problem, man.

387
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,771
You guys want
some breakfast or...

388
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,939
Oh, did you just wake up?

389
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,674
Oh, man remember those days?

390
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,676
Barely.

391
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,513
(CHUCKLES) What?

392
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,337
BILLY: I had the bed
the other way, but still...

393
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,719
Lotta history
in this room, Alex.

394
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,754
Lot of history.

395
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,725
You know there was a fire
here, like eight years ago.

396
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,826
Really?
Yeah.

397
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,828
No, there was
no fire. Stop...

398
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,111
Don't start calling
it a fire again. Okay?

399
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,366
Hey, no bickering, right?

400
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,103
He's just really
sensitive about the fire.

401
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,006
Takes a few minutes, but it
was like, instantaneous.

402
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,568
Yeah. This place is so
much smaller than I...

403
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,714
So was there,
like a fire or not?

404
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,956
I try to help. That's what I do.
I'm a hero.

405
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,386
You know if somebody else
like Jake had been there,

406
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,055
who know? The whole place would
have probably burned down.

407
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,756
Okay, there was no fire.

408
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,559
Okay? You destroyed
everything I owned.

409
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,161
Sorry, man. BILLY: With
a fire extinguisher.

410
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,595
Brings up a lot of old issues.

411
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,032
I almost 100%
sure there was a fire.

412
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,535
If there was a fire, why wasn't
anything in my room burned at all?

413
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,103
Because I put the fire out.

414
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,539
I prevented your room from burning.
You're welcome!

415
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,942
Not a single part of the room, Gunderson
was in the least bit charred.

416
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,277
Okay? And yet,

417
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,112
all my photographs and my books

418
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,514
and my, my computer, my...

419
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,617
Magazine collection,
my mom's prized collection

420
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,220
of presidential campaign buttons
dating back to Grover Garfield

421
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,622
were completely covered
in foam and destroyed.

422
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,225
(STAMMERS) It's just a little
difficult to reconcile with this fire

423
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,561
that you so heroically put out.

424
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,129
I think the important
question is,

425
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,864
who the hell is Grover Garfield?

426
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,899
Okay, I misspoke.

427
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,601
That's not a president.

428
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,891
It's not the...

429
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
Point.

430
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,145
Hi.

431
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,147
No way.

432
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,932
Oh, yeah. That was here
when we got here. Huh.

433
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,555
MAN: Thought it was
pretty fucking Gershwin.

434
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,557
JAKE: Yeah,
it's pretty Gershwin.

435
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,493
JAKE: That's a good
thing, right?

436
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,162
MAN: Yeah, I guess.

437
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,452
You know, I feel like doing
something really dumb.

438
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:56,968
What do you think?

439
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,339
Oh, I don't know you.

440
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,140
Uh, guys.

441
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,648
BILLY: No, no,
I know Mr. Kim.

442
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:14,585
Larry, sorry. Yeah, yeah it's
just that, it's just flared up.

443
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,387
It's terrible timing and I really
wanted to come to work today.

444
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,478
BILLY: It's just a general
kind of hurting feeling.

445
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,160
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

446
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,395
Uh, no, no, no.

447
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:25,831
It's a urologist...

448
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,166
(INAUDIBLE)

449
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,004
How much for all those?
Five?

450
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,906
How much for everything?

451
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,410
Squirrel and a hydro post.

452
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,313
It's got a little nut for
a football.

453
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,648
What, Rocks
thought it was funny.

454
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,749
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

455
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,463
Bee in your face.
There's a bee in your face.

456
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,831
BILLY: I already have
an appointment.

457
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,700
You don't have to do that.
It's in the network...

458
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,036
Don't wanna bother
your friend on a Saturday.

459
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:26,724
ROCKS: There he is.

460
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,508
JAKE: Hey. What do you think?
Hey.

461
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,331
I like it.
JAKE: Yeah?

462
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,366
You gonna leave it here?
Yeah.

463
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,468
This is kind of
a symbolic bathroom for me.

464
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,905
(CLEARS THROAT) Truth be told
Tabatha and I actually...

465
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,907
Had sex in there.

466
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,675
Go on.

467
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,611
It was super uncomfortable.

468
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,087
But, you know I've actually thought about
it a lot about it since then and...

469
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,711
Even though it was awful, honestly awful.
Disgusting...

470
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,186
(FLUSHING)

471
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:58,256
I think it was maybe
one of the most

472
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,424
enjoyable sexual
encounters of my life.

473
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
In retrospect.

474
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,862
It's so hard to pee
with a boner.

475
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,824
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry about that.

476
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,568
God to say it out loud,
it sounds so uh, trite.

477
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,210
Sex in the bathroom?
JAKE: Yeah.

478
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,041
No, no it sounds all right.

479
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,343
I uh... I need
to tell you something.

480
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,546
When I saw Tabatha...

481
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,248
She...
At Ted and Audrey's?

482
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,570
Yeah, she told me
that her and...

483
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,267
You know,
what's-his-fuck broke up.

484
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,556
Sebastian?
Yeah.

485
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,438
What are you talking about?

486
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,740
Are you fucking with me?

487
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,595
Tabatha's single now?
Currently single?

488
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,997
Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

489
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,632
And you found out this when?

490
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,601
On Wednesday?
And now it's Saturday.

491
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,470
I thought she was
coming to the walk,

492
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,939
she said you invited her
so I just figured you...

493
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,381
I wanted... Are you fucking...
You know what?

494
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,078
No, I glad I didn't know that.
Wednesday was...

495
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,246
That was bad for me.

496
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,814
No, it is actually good timing.

497
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,516
This is fucking terrible timing.

498
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,618
Dude, I'm leaving tomorrow.

499
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,320
I do not need to know this now.

500
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,655
Oh, come on, man
this is fucked up.

501
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,956
I mean what am I going
to do with this information?

502
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,825
In fact why didn't she tell me?

503
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,360
Fuck her!

504
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,482
I didn't mean that. That was knee-jerk.
That's not me.

505
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,531
She's probably
in pain. Oh God.

506
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,701
I should call here.
No, no, no, no, no.

507
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,303
What? I don't understand
what you wanted me to do.

508
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,672
God! Man, you know what
dick move for telling me.

509
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,375
Real dick move.
But I appreciate it.

510
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,477
That took guts. Should I
not have told you at all?

511
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,812
You should not
have told me at all.

512
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,146
No.
Okay and I apologize.

513
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,388
You should have told me before.

514
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,737
Okay, then I'm not sorry
and you're welcome.

515
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,385
I can't do the walk, it's...

516
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,827
No in fact... You can
do the walk, come on.

517
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,956
Ah! God!
This changes nothing.

518
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,346
This changes nothing.
You're right.

519
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,862
Right, let's go, Tabatha...
Rocks... Oh, fuck!

520
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,399
JAKE: No and to think that...

521
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,068
For the last three years
she was with Sebastian.

522
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,636
Tristan before that.

523
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,038
Where are the normal names here?

524
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,340
She's almost literally
been with somebody

525
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,309
every single day since
we broke up and now that

526
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,745
I have a chance
to be with her, I can't

527
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,180
because I'm leaving and I'm
never going to see her again.

528
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,083
Okay, well, why don't
we focus on the walk?

529
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,418
I mean, where are we going next?

530
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,819
No, I think Jake's right.

531
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,355
Let's focus on things that
we have no control over.

532
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,657
Gunderson, will you
look at, look at him.

533
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,493
Okay? Look at this
little face.

534
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:19,263
Cant' we, can't you be supportive
of this face for once in your life?

535
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,698
I've been supportive.

536
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,234
Hey, who put the fire
out in your room?

537
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,036
Okay, for the last time
stop calling it a fire.

538
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,739
Then what should
I call it? A conflagration?

539
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,441
A holocaust?
Here we go.

540
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,209
Just drop it.
How dare you!

541
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,844
Let it go.
We lost... No.

542
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,013
I will not...
I will not...

543
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:39,617
We lost great aunts and... You
didn't lose anyone at all.

544
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,552
Well, not directly but... ROCKS:
I don't know what that means.

545
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,421
Indirectly, almost surely...
Okay, all right.

546
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,623
Fair. Fair.

547
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,692
Jake, I got a call from work,

548
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,028
and one of my teachers
got food poisoning

549
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,596
for like, the umpteenth time,

550
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,632
and I have to go in
for just an hour,

551
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,434
I couldn't get anyone
to cover, it's on the way.

552
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,568
It'll just be an hour.
You guys can come. No.

553
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,103
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

554
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,039
It's on the way.
No! Dude, not now!

555
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,543
Now's the worst possible time. I've
got an existential crisis afoot.

556
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,077
You don't mean existential.

557
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,346
I don't even know if I mean afoot.
What does afoot mean?

558
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,387
ROCKS: Pythagorean's theorem,
you guys.

559
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,222
It's super cool.
You're gonna have...

560
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,090
Five to seven questions on it.

561
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,959
On the test, depending
on which one you get.

562
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,321
So, I wanna go over it
and make sure we all...

563
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,384
BILLY: Did you
just look at my test?

564
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,993
Gunderson, stop
looking at my test.

565
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,382
GUNDERSON: I'm not
looking at your test.

566
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,472
I've already done number 21.

567
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,875
I bet you forgot about the
three quadratics, Gunderson.

568
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,880
GUNDERSON: I bet you forgot that you're a
college graduate and this is pointless.

569
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,015
BILLY: It won't be
pointless when I beat you.

570
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,217
GUNDERSON: Yes, it will.

571
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,453
Hey, is he almost
done with his class?

572
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:50,455
(PHONE RINGING)

573
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:55,794
Is that Emma?

574
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,367
I'm just disappointed.

575
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,369
I know.

576
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,905
EMMA: I just...

577
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,508
I can't believe you would miss
one of the last appointments

578
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,510
before the baby would come.

579
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:14,712
I'm very sorry.

580
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,701
And to go out drinking
with your friends...

581
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,185
It's just such a fucking
cliche and... Okay.

582
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,587
Oh my God! I sound like I'm one
of those bitchy annoying girls.

583
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,159
Well, you have every right to me mad, okay.
You do. I'm sorry.

584
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,695
I absolutely shouldn't have
missed the appointment.

585
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,564
No, you should not have
missed the appointment.

586
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:36,500
But it was not about just drinking
with my friends, okay, it wasn't.

587
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,302
We are trying to get
Jake to stay.

588
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,371
You know if he has
a good time today,

589
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,333
he might actually do that,
it could go either way.

590
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,174
Really?
Yes.

591
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,143
And you know between
Billy and Gunderson,

592
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,678
he's our only viable
babysitting option.

593

(CHUCKLES)

594
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,384
Oh.

595
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,086
Okay. I can't
argue with that.

596
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,590
So listen...

597
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,613
At the appointment today...

598
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:07,164
Doctor Leponis and I discussed
the birth plan...

599
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,166
Yeah. You know, and who's gonna

600
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,002
be in there when
it all goes down and...

601
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,405
I decided that I want to keep
the participants to a minimum.

602
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,839
Fine. Yeah.

603
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,275
Okay, it'll be
just... Just us.

604
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,245
Cozy.

605
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,314
No, I...
I mean not you.

606
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,950
She said that it's actually
really common

607
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,918
for women to not want
their partners in there...

608
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,753
Are you kidding?
For that. I mean...

609
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,115
God! I don't want
you to see that.

610
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,757
You just decided this?

611
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,260
Well, Marcel, I...

612
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,929
You know that I've been really
stressed out about this. I'm scared.

613
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,031
I mean, what if you
don't want me after that?

614
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,399
Are you kidding me right now?

615
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,801
You're not one who has to
have a baby coming out...

616
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,271
Of your vagina, okay?

617
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,906
Yes, I do realize that.

618
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,574
I understand how
children are born.

619
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,077
Look, how would
you feel, if I brought

620
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,946
a bunch of strangers
into the bathroom to watch you

621
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,315
do whatever it is you do
in there for 45 minutes.

622
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,984
That's not something
that you want people to see.

623
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,652
What are you talking about?

624
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:04,588
How is me being there for the
birth of our son remotely like

625
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,324
you bringing in strangers
to watch me take a dump?

626
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,159
Okay, I get that that's not
a great analogy, now, okay.

627
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,594
No, it's not a great
analogy at all.

628
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,996
It's not even a
mediocre analogy.

629
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,897
I don't, I don't even
understand. Am I...

630
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,165
Am I the one going
into the bathroom?

631
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,400
Am I bringing in the strangers?

632
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,602
No, you're the stranger.

(SIGHS)

634
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,115
I didn't mean it like that.

635
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,311
Yeah, you did.

636
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,648

I don't know what a function is.

644
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,000

don't know the answer?

matters in the real world.

JAKE: Ah, good question.

655
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,621
You know, actually French playwright
Jean Anouilh put it best.

656
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:13,157
Okay, my friend is having an
existential crisis, please.

657
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,159
He does not mean existential.

You know what,
you need to know this.

659
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,896
You really do. So write
his down if you have to.

660
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,864
Life is not gonna turn out
the way you planned it.

661
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:22,866
That's the bottom line.

662
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,802
Okay. And here's
another piece of advice.

663
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:27,371
Don't invest in anyone.

664
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,740
You probably meet a guy,

665
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,782
and he's gonna be great.

666
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,510
And you'll love him and you
give everything to him

667
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,145
and just when
you think it's perfect...

668
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,847
He's gonna take your heart,

669
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,049
he's gonna put it in a blender
and he's gonna press frappe.

670
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,350
Okay. Then he's gonna
pour it down the toilet

671
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,986
and if that wasn't bad enough,

672
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,189
you're gonna jump on into that
toilet after and try and grab it

673
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,759
and you're gonna come out the other
side covered in piss and shit

of<i> Shawshank Redemption</i>

the good news.

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,742
is a probably painful,
inevitable death.

681
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,946
GUNDERSON: So, all
right, class dismissed.

682
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,108
Right, why don't
you figure this out...

683
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,919
Hey, Em.
Bye, guys.

684
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,557
(SIGHS)

685
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,575
Decisions. That's the
big thing right now.

686
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,778
We're just having all
these arguments about...

687
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,479
You know what color
the baby's room should be.

688
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,748
Yellow or cream,
things like that.

689
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,416
Yellow.
ROCKS: And I find myself

690
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,819
talking all these hard lined positions
really just to argue, I mean...

691
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,255
I don't care what color
the actual baby's room is,

692
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:52,657
'cause in the end
it doesn't matter.

693
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,124
BILLY: It should be yellow.
But I hear myself arguing

694
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,260
that one color
will literally lead

695
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:58,629
the child becoming president and the
other one's gonna make him a murderer.

696
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,930
Same thing.

697
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,299
Yeah, it's totally irrational,
all right, I mean...

698
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,541
Nobody actually remembers what
color their baby room was.

699
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,136
Yellow.

700
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,237
Really?

701
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,338
Yeah.

702
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,439
Explains a lot.

703
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,474
It was awesome.

704
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,581
BILLY: What are we doing here?
Is this a planned stop?

705
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,216
I hate cathedrals!

706
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,113
BILLY: Ugh!

707
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,308
And the answer is, back in 1895,

708
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,809
"Construction of the cathedral"

709
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,346
"was halted due
to a labor dispute"

710
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,082
"that resulted in..."

711
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,685
(CLICKS TONGUE) Fuck it.

712
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,953
No. (CHUCKLES)

713
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,955
Put myself to sleep with that.
I apologize...

714
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,156
What happened to labor dispute?

715
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,658
Oh, who cares. Fuck it.
You know. (SIGHS)

716
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,561
You know what, teaching
here is one of the...

717
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,397
One of the great achievements
of mine in New York.

718
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,832
Maybe the only
great achievement.

719
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,367
That's not true. That's
not true, come on.

720
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,735
It's true! No, honestly. I think
I did about the only thing.

721
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:12,803
No, that's not true.

722
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:15,873
GUNDERSON: None of your students
have amounted to anything. So...

723
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,975
Yeah. Doesn't really
count as an achievement.

724
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,243
BILLY: Gunderson,
come on...

725
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,644
ROCKS: Yeah, you know,
like, great achievements.

726
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,145
No.
ROCKS: I mean, that's it.

727
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,814
No, but... What about that
show you had in New Jersey?

728
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:25,482
Yeah...
That was awesome.

729
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,017
It was in New Jersey but still...
You had one in Staten...

730
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,552
You had a thing
in Staten Island.

731
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,753
I mean, if it's
Staten Island, Yeah.

732
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,655
It's something.
It's something.

733
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,824
GUNDERSON: Remember, you almost
sold a painting on the subway?

734
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,325
BILLY: Oh, yeah!
No, no, no.

735
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,895
The guy almost stole the
painting on the subway.

736
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,429
BILLY: Oh. GUNDERSON:
But still, he liked it.

737
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,998
Yeah, I guess.

738
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,165
I mean, people who are
really excited...

739
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,600
You gotta start somewhere.

740
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,002
That's true, I guess.
It's tough.

741
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:46,904
I don't know.
It's good.

742
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,839
This is actually...
Kind of makes me feel good.

743
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,274
I love this place.

744
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,776
Really, 'cause
these are garbage.

745
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:56,058
And your fridge is gonna
be filled with that.

746
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,714
ROCKS: Yeah, I hope.

747
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,883
How do you pretend to like that?
That's awful.

748
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,218
I don't have to pretend.
That's a beauty.

749
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,020
I mean, I... I
genuinely like this.

750
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,622
You're not understanding what this
kid did with space, negative space.

751
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,557
Uh... GUNDERSON: Now, I understand
why you like Jake's stuff.

752
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,926
Hey...

753
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,962
Is it about the money?

754
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,063
Does your dad need...
I mean...

755
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,364
Is that why you're leaving?

756
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,199
If it is, I'm more than happy...

757
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,301
I don't want your money.

758
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,368
I'm just saying,
I'll give you a little...

759
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,304
I'm not your charity case, okay?

760
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,105
Jacob.

761
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,446
I was wondering if you could
clear up something for me.

762
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,149
Weren't you planning on
breaking up with Emma

763
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,651
before you found out she was
carrying your demon seed?

764
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,219
I... (STUTTERS)

765
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,622
No, man, I... Really,
you weren't?

766
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,092
No, we were gonna have
a bit of a conversation

767
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:45,162
that, you know, could've
pre-empted... Good.

768
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,464
But...
And my son.

769
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,267
Right, yeah. But the fact...
But, I...

770
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,668
I don't... We were definitely
not gonna break up, no.

771
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:53,971
Not... Not for sure.
Hmm.

772
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,946
What's the latest?

773
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,449
Well, my partner at the firm

774
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,117
has actually set up
an appointment

775
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,952
with his urologist
friend for me today.

776
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,087
Right.

777
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,055
So I am telling him

778
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,324
that the rash
has spread to my legs

779
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,959
and I'm having trouble walking.
Ah. Oh.

780
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,628
Ergo, I won't be able
to go to his doctor.

781
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,997
Yeah. (SIGHS)
Well...

782
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,999
Sounds medically dubious.

783
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,165
Yeah.

784
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,706
(SIGHS)

785
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,924
Hey, do you think that
the guys hate me?

786
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,380
Yeah.

787
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,249
No, seriously.

788
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,220
I mean, the whole lawyer
thing, the money,

789
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,455
it just feels different

790
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,125
than when we were all
unemployed and broke.

791
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,726
Yeah, you don't wanna
go back to that, though.

792
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,994
Well, I mean, do I?

793
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,063
Remember how much
you used to give blood?

794
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,731
Yeah...
It's not safe.

795
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,034
Yeah, but it was... It
was sort of exciting.

796
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,468
I guess.

797
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,073
I keep thinking about

798
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:06,309
what the most important thing
is for my son, what I...

799
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,078
What I want for him the most,

800
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,647
besides, obviously
wanting him to be...

801
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,983
Healthy, easy-going...
Yeah, sure.

802
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,752
I think it's just
for him to be confident

803
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:16,820
and not worrying all the time,

804
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:19,056
about what everyone else thinks.

805
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,060
Yeah.

806
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,297
Yeah, okay.
I like that.

807
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,872
I'm sorry for your loss.

808
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,119
(SIGHS) My God...

809
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:53,857
The thing is, that I can't really talk
to my friends about it, you know.

810
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,859
They're good guys, but...

811
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,396
(SIGHS) It's... We're not
really the kind of guys

812
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,698
who can, you know,
open up and...

813
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,301
(CLEARS THROAT)
And really, I'm sorry,

814
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,902
is there meant
to be, like, a booth

815
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,438
or a partition, or wall, or...

816
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,007
That's confession in a
Catholic church, Jacob.

817
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,276
We are Episcopalian.

818
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,479
Sure. Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)

819
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,283
Just kind of feels weird talking
to someone I can't see.

820
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,885
I feel that way every
time I talk to God.

821
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,620
(LAUGHS) Zing.

822
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,322
Not really.

823
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,890
No. I guess not.

824
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,627
Well, I may as well
just dive into it, then.

825
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,497
I think I'm still in love
with Tabatha. (LAUGHS)

826
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,132
There it is.
I am.

827
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,467
And I also know
that my dad needs me.

828
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,568
That's important.

829
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,537
Especially now.
He's sick.

830
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:45,976
But I just... I can't
shake this feeling

831
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,712
that maybe leaving is
the wrong thing to do.

832
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,581
Let me tell you this.

833
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,584
God very rarely
limits us to two options.

834
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:58,155
In fact, our choices
are endless, infinite.

835
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,518
But it is up to us to make one.

836
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,693
I would love to be able
to tell you what to do.

837
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,962
But I'm an Episcopalian,
not a Catholic priest.

838
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:06,964
Right.

839
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,267
I get it. (LAUGHS) Okay.

840
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:13,870
You know what, just before I...
I'm not 100% on it.

841
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,907
So, when you say "infinite"
you know, there...

842
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,775
How many is that exactly?

843
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,377
It's like with Jesus.

844
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,578
Okay, hold on. (LAUGHS)

845
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,307
Accepting we all know how
that turned out for him.

846
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,849
You know.

847
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,268
No, I'm just... It's just...
I'm just saying.

848
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,669
It's probably not the
best example, that's all.

849
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,022
Go on.

850
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,558
I tell you what, maybe it's time

851

you can't tell anyone.

kind of, you know, done.
It's been did. So...

warning you.

three days, on and off.

Mostly, on.

999
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:14,183
So I don't know if this is
nostalgia or... I just...

1000
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,818
Come at your own peril,
that's what I'm saying.

1001
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,580
Understood. (WHISPERS)
Okay, no more talking.

1002
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,116
We'll talk about it
on the way over.

1003
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,824
(MUFFLED) Okay.

1004
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,426
(CHUCKLES) Great.

1005
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:27,196
Oh. Can I
meet you there?

1006
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,199
Mmm-hmm.
Okay.

1007
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,701

00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,540
How quickly... What is the
vaginal rejuvenation like?

1010
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,209
(LAUGHS) Good question.

1011
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,278
That I don't actually know.

1012
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,347
Because Noreen
had a c-section.

1013
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,683
Oh, okay.
Right, so it was fine.

1014
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:50,286
Or it would've been fine
if we have had any desire

1015
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:51,622
to have sex afterwards.

1016
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:53,556

breakfast every Saturday?

Yeah.
God.

1019
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,363
The only way that a
girl would get invited

1020
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,899
was if she'd slept with one
of us the night before.

1021
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:03,901
Bunch of assholes!

(LAUGHS)

1023
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,204
Anyway, boys' breakfast
turns into couples' brunch,

1024
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,107
which eventually
becomes birthday parties.

1025
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:14,911
Completely elaborate, unnecessarily
complicated birthday parties

1026
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,447
at which I am dressed
as a pirate.

(INHALES)

1028
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,918
And somebody's gotta
take you to breakfast.

1029
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:25,221
I haven't had pancakes
in eight years.

1030
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:26,723
I'll make you pancakes.

1031
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,091
Shit!

1032
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,095
What? I'm doing it now. Now.

1033
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:33,262
You're doing it now?
Dad!

1034
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,397
Yes, I... I'm getting
the dessert.

1035
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,498
What do you mean, what
have I been doing?

1036
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,566
I'm... I've been
playing with children!

1037
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,234
(RICKY SCREAMING)

1038
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,370
Now!
Ricky, not now.

1039
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,506
Ricky, that's enough. Now!

1040
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,142
WOMAN: Before the party

1041
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:48,077
that I organized...
Dad!

1042
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,112
I planned this!

1043
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,921
Oh. Okay.

1044
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,923
Guys, I need to tell you something.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

1045
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,425
BILLY: Oh,
look who it is!

1046
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,060
Jake, it's my partner.

1047
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,129
You know the guy
I've been lying to all day

1048
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,864
so that we could go out
and have an adventure,

1049
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,232
that guy, remember that?

1050
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:10,900
Yeah, I do.
Unconscionable.

1051
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,136
Yeah, I know, I got the files.

1052
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,270
You know what, I'm actually

1053
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,112
on my way to the
doctor's right now.

1054
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:18,641
He's gotta go. Fuck you! Oh.

1055
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,877
Gunderson, what the fuck!

1056
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:22,912
What the fuck!
(MOCKS) "What the fuck!"

1057
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:25,248
This... No, this is not a joke, okay?
This is my job.

1058
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,983
Oh, it's not a joke? No.

1059
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,184
Is this a fucking joke, "This
is a Tattoo?" All right, guys.

1060
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,286
You know what,
I told you before that

1061
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,587
I didn't know that you got a tattoo.
JAKE: Okay.

1062
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:32,989
GUNDERSON: Oh, you didn't
know I got a tattoo. Guys.

1063
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:34,590
BILLY: That is correct. For one
second, if I could just...

1064
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,758
And anyway mine
is completely different.

1065
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,859
Rocks.

1066
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,796
What? Just leave me out.
What... Rocks!

1067
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:41,918
Yeah, fine.
He knew.

1068
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,800
Rocks!

1069
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,935
When he found out about your
"This is not a Tattoo" tattoo,

1070
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,436
he decided it'd be ironic

1071
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,071
if he got a "This is
a Tattoo" tattoo.

1072
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,406
It doesn't matter.
Who cares?

1073
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,608
That's not ironic, you imbecile.

1074
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,277
Yeah, it is!
No, it's not!

1075
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,846
You have a tattoo
that says it's a tattoo.

1076
00:46:57,282 --> 00:46:59,949
That's the exact opposite
of what "ironic" means!

1077
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,285
Yeah, but that
is the ironic part.

1078
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,687
No, it's not. Yes, that's
what I was going for.

1079
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:07,089
You're a fucking idiot.

1080
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:09,158
Fucking stop it, okay?

1081
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:12,295
Gunderson, you are a
shit-face, you know that?

1082
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:15,264
You're an inconsiderate
shit pile!

1083
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,033
All right.
You know what?

1084
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,601
You know what?

1085
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:23,105
I wish that I let your stuff
burn up in that room.

1086
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:24,740
You fucking...

1087
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,577
(LAUGHING) Ow!

1088
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:30,880
Cut it out, guys.

1089
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,549
BILLY: You son of a...

1090
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,184
So civil.

1091
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,306
What are you doing?

1092
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,554
Stop. Enough. Billy!

1093
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,389
JAKE: Leave him alone! Get off of him!
I will pummel you!

1094
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,625
All right. Fine! It was me!
All right, it was me!

1095
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,667
I did it.
Not Gunderson, me.

1096
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:46,128
It was me!

1097
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:49,165
Stop it!
It wasn't Gunderson!

1098
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,767
I ruined your stuff!
All right?

1099
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:57,139
(SIGHS) I destroyed your
stuff, all right? I'm sorry.

1100
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,208
It's true. It wasn't me.

1101
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:01,777
JAKE: I was hammered.
I mean...

1102
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:04,046
I was shit-faced and I
thought it'd be funny.

1103
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,848
I had no idea

1104
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,718
that the foam
in those extinguishers

1105
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:11,654
cause so much damage.
I thought they were...

1106
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,855
What?

1107
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,390
Gunderson wasn't even with me.

1108
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,525
You just immediately
assumed it was him.

1109
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:19,495
I got to say,
I admired your work

1110
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,564
and was happy
to take credit for it.

1111
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,366
I can't believe you took
the blame this whole time.

1112
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:24,333
JAKE: It was dick
thing to do, Billy.

1113
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,269
I should've told you sooner

1114
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,671
and I will totally pay
you back for everything

1115
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:31,908
that was damaged, with interest.

1116
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,576
Wow, feels good.

1117
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,045
That actually feels good.
It's a relief.

1118
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,414
(CHUCKLES) Dragging that
around for so long.

1119
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,856
It's good. It's nice...
Nice feeling.

1120
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,617
(SIGHS)

1121
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:45,121
There's one other thing
I need to tell you.

1122
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,622
About the walk.

1123
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,424
And Tabatha (LAUGHS)

1124
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,946
(SIGHS) Guys, no offense,

1125
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,380
but, you're
not invited, all right?

1126
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,049
I need to do this on my own.

1127
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,518
Damn it,
that's broken. (SIGHS)

1128
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,120
Let the record show

1129
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,656
that I'm no longer in this
to keep Jake in New York.

1130
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,092
Excuse me? You're trying
to keep me in New York?

1131
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,794
Well, it was. Now, I
just wanna make sure

1132
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:26,996
that you and Tabatha
never get back together.

1133
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:28,431
Are you fucking with me?

1134
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,433
You're trying to break
Tabatha and me up?

1135
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,134
You guys aren't
together now. (LAUGHS)

1136
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,570
Not current... You know what
I mean, for crying out loud.

1137
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:35,972
You guys are awful together.

1138
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,140
You're worse
than Heathcliff and Cathy.

1139
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,276
I was always more of a
Garfield man myself.

1140
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,644
I'm just looking out for you.

1141
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,479
You don't need to look out.
I can look after my...

1142
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,114
You know what,
I had the stupid idea

1143
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,016
that maybe you'd be
happy for me. God, stupid.

1144
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,317
I was happy for you, Jake,

1145
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,152
when I thought we're gonna
be out adventuring.

1146
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,787
All right. Why don't we just
meet up with each other

1147
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:53,522
in a couple of hours and
grab a drink then, huh?

1148
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,524
How's that sound? Rocks,
drinks in a couple of hours?

1149
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:57,426
No? He's drunk.

1150
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,362
What's your big plan anyway?
Aren't you leaving tomorrow?

1151
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:01,597
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe we'll
do a long-distance thing.

1152
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,833
Maybe I won't
leave, I don't know.

1153
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:04,967
Really? Seriously?

1154
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,502
It's possible.
I don't know, Billy!

1155
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,604
I just know that
I've never been happier

1156
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,139
than I was when I was with her.

1157
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:11,340
That is not true, all right?

1158
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,875
Life sucked back then

1159
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,611
and it sucks now.
Deal with it.

1160
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,711
You know what, I didn't want
to have to do this, but you...

1161
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,015
You leave me
no choice. All right?

1162
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:21,684
Oh, come on!

1163
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,821
I'm on your tail! Fuck's sake!
Guys, guys, guys!

1164
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,024
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Okay, okay, fine.

1165
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,692
You can come,
but for fuck's sake,

1166
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,627
just please, please,
behave yourselves.

1167
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:32,728
Who you're talking to?

1168
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,330
Of course, we will.
Yeah.

1169
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,731
And we're gonna
need to bring wine.

1170
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:36,999
And you're paying.

1171
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:38,534
Okay. Well, we are
near my office.

1172
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,735
There's a place a
couple of blocks down

1173
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,170
that we've got
an expense account.

1174
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,304
Great.

1175
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:44,907
I need a cupcake.

1176
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,078
Just real quick.

1177
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,581
The... I know the fire
extinguisher debacle was Jake,

1178
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,717
but I'm still gonna blame you.

1179
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:57,553
Impressive, and I accept.

1180
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,158
BILLY: Come on, Jake, just one.
JAKE: No.

1181
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,893
BILLY: Please! Jake.
JAKE: No.

1182
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:06,796
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake,
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake.

1183
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:08,931
Real quick.
Ugh...

1184
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,033
Fine. All right. A robber
walks into your house,

1185
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:12,601
puts a gun to your head,
he says<i> Sophie's Choice.</i>

1186
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,236
Option one is

1187
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:17,907
you have to gain and lose
30 pounds every month

1188
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,008
for the rest of your life, or...
Oh.

1189
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,277
Or option two,
you could stop making him

1190
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,112
play this stupid game.

1191
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,748
Gunderson, will you just
shut the fuck up? Billy?

1192
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,683
Mr. Kim.

1193
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,518
Larry, please.
How are you feeling?

1194
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,321
Not good.

1195
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:35,458
I am coughing up blood.

1196
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,759
Oh, dear, really?

1197
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,627
No. No.

1198
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,669
I don't know
why I just said that.

1199
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,031
I see.

1200
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,366
Yeah. No, I just...
I just... You know.

1201
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,502
I thought I'd pick up a wine

1202
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:48,537
on my way to the doctor.

1203
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,639
It's not exactly on the way.

1204
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:51,774
No, it is not.

1205
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,110
That's true.

We're not his friends.

1209
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,152
You know, I just wanted to...

1210
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,721
Wanted to pick up a bottle,

1211
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,624
little something
to wet the palette.

1212
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:11,327
It's just a little parched.

1213
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,929
Next time,
you wanna spend the day

1214
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,431
horsing around
with your friends...

1215
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,466
Oh, Mr. Kim, that's...
I get it.

1216
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,468
I do. Just...

1217
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,203
Next time tell me the truth.

1218
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:23,572
Okay? (LAUGHS)

00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,408
(LAUGHS)

1220
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,748
Nailed it.

00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,250
Congratulations, you got
away with it.

1222
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,918
What the hell, I mean, was that?

1223
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,486
I mean, is he serious?

1224
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,688
He seems perfect.

1225
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,824

What are you doing
here? Please, no.

1236
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,732
You sleep with Helen Keller

1237
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:26,134
because of the heightened
sense of touch.

1238
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,004
You should kill Amelia Earhart

1239
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:31,173
because there would
finally be a body. Oh.

1240
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:33,042
And there would be closure.
Ah, that's a sweet story.

1241
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:34,476
There'd be closure.

1242
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:37,846
And then, you're gonna
marry no one, actually.

1243
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,048
Because that one
was a trick question.

1244
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,649
Because how do you know
someone well enough

1245
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,617
to marry them? You don't.
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

Oh, yeah. I'd probably
sleep with all of them.

And then, maybe one
would die accidentally.

does not make it so.

Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
That was on me.

00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,983
That was on me.
There's a bathroom upstairs.

Yeah.

1334

What I was trying to
say to you before

1335
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,633
just so you understand,
is it's not that women

1336
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:28,644
necessarily grow up
better than men.

1337
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:32,614
It's just that, their path
to adulthood is... Different.

1338
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:37,352
I don't give a shit and
I was just being contrary.

Hmm.

1340
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,492
So this is the room then, huh?
This is.

1341
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:45,661
This is my childhood bedroom.

1342
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,831
It is exactly the way I left it.

1343
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,666
That's nice.

1344
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:53,402
Mine's pretty much the same.
It's got a treadmill in it now.

00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:54,404
Yeah.

00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:03,312
I don't want to freak you out, but there's
six enormous faces looking at us.

What's their story?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

1352
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,440
Just doesn't make sense.

1353
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:36,678
I mean, I lied repeatedly and
then directly to Mr. Kim's face,

1354
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,080
and then, nothing.

1355
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:46,288
It's funny. I don't remember inquiring
about you, in any kind of way.

1356
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,856
It's just unsettling.

1357
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,058
That's, that's the word
that I would use.

1358
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:51,361
Fine, I'll bite.

1359
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:56,298
Billy, you got away with it.
What's the big deal?

1360
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:59,801
It's just that
the universe has an order.

1361
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:02,137
Your transgressions
must be punished.

00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,973
Without that order,
there's... Chaos.

1363
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,476
You really are a
simple, simple boy.

1364
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:13,008
Have you seen her?
Huh?

1365
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,610
Tabatha. Have you seen her?
BILLY: No.

1366
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:16,952
Asshole. You don't care.

1367
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:18,587
Neither of you care.

1368
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:22,257
What are you even doing here? I asked
you not to... I begged you not to come.

1369
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:25,294
You. You! That stunt you
pulled at dinner, come on man.

1370
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,863
I'm going through an
existential crisis here.

1371
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,264
You can't go... Whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

1372
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:31,733
You are not going through
an existential crisis.

1373
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:35,737
An existential crisis means that your whole
existence is being called into question.

1374
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,240
What you're dealing with,
are transitional issues.

1375
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,390
Is that really what
existential means?

1376
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:42,512
Yes.

1377
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,112
Oh.

1378
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,550
You don't have to yell at me.

1379
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,545
I didn't yell at you.
That was yelling.

1380
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,323
So for my birthday, my
dad bought me Mmm-hmm.

1381
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,425
A Holga camera.

1382
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:58,994
It was my first camera ever.

1383
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,131
And, this photograph was taken

1384
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,702
the first time that I ever
heard my parents having sex.

1385
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:09,104
Okay.

1386
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,339
(CHUCKLES)

1387
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,615
I heard all these sounds and...

1388
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:15,310
I knew it was significant

1389
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:18,614
so I ran back and I got my
camera and I got a tripod.

1390
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,916
And I stood outside and I
faced away from the door.

1391
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,118
And I looked
and I took the picture.

1392
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,288
What a weirdo. What a weirdo.
I know.

1393
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,556
I know, right.

1394
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:31,760
And you would
not, not frame that

1395
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,695
and put it on your wall
because...

1396
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:36,965
It's a keeper, and you
put it up on your wall.

1397
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,167
I didn't frame it.

1398
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,802
Well, it's in a frame.

1399
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,104
I know, they framed it.

1400
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,805
They framed it.
They framed it.

1401
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,574
Yeah.
So sick.

1402
01:00:45,576 --> 01:00:47,909
And did you tell them
honestly what it is.

1403
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,631
Do they know what they framed?
I don't know.

1404
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,513
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

1405
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:52,614
I don't want to know, either.

1406
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:53,776
(LAUGHING)

1407
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:58,186
God! I'm worried
about her.

1408
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,788
Maybe she's got diarrhea.

1409
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,156
You know, sometimes when she
drinks too much coffee,

1410
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,491
her stomach can get a little...

1411
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:03,825
How about this one?

1412
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,495
A robber shoots you in the head.

1413
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:08,964
Says,<i> "Sophie's Choice.</i>"

1414
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:11,566
"Play chess with the dog
or scrabble with the cat."

1415
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,202
Hmm.

1416
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,371
I don't think you understand
how this game is played.

1417
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,040
Oh! (LAUGHING)

1418
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:20,676
I'm gonna get some scotch.

1419
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,046
I'm gonna take a shit.

1420
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:32,435
You know, Jake,
you're a good egg.

1421
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:35,357
Well, that is true, sir.

1422
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,620
You know what you should do?

1423
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,631
Marry my daughter, have babies

1424
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,199
and name one after me.

1425
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:49,571
(LAUGHING)

1426
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:50,806
(CHUCKLES SKEPTICALLY)

1427
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:52,174
Ow.

1428
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:53,375
Oh, boy.

1429
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,712
(LAUGHING) Wine stain?

1430
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:58,213
Yeah. Let's not go down...
This really...

1431
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,815
That's really quite a mess.

1432
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:01,216
That's quite unfortunate.

1433
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,251
Looking for...
Oh, I could get you a shirt.

1434
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,753
I need to borrow a...

1435
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:07,456
Back, back under the
mattress where it belongs.

1436
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,218
A thoroughly bad choice...

1437
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:18,300
I don't know why...
I've...

1438
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:20,736
Tabatha...
Here's your picture.

1439
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,672
Can you...
I'm so.

1440
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,908
That's my fault.
I'm sorry.

1441
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:40,355
One, have a threesome
with a couple twice your age

1442
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:43,658
or two, masturbate in front
of a room full of strangers.

1443
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:46,862
(LAUGHING)

1444
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:56,738
We should go.

1445
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,540
Oh, God, yes.

1446
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:06,948
JAKE: I don't get it.
I thought you invited me

1447
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,283
around so we could talk.

1448
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,319
Jake, I... Just...
I don't think...

1449
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:15,357
(SIGHS)

1450
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,628
Do you remember this?

1451
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,465
Oh, my God.

1452
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,667
From our first date.

1453
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,068
Do you remember?

1454
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:30,912
I saved it, obviously.
And I...

1455
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:32,941
(CHUCKLING)

1456
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,676
I framed it and...

1457
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:36,798
Anyway...
(LAUGHS) Look at that.

1458
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:47,222
I thought I was really fucked
up for the last couple of days.

1459
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:54,329
Hmm, but I think I've been fucked
up for a long time, maybe.

1460
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,403
So...

1461
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,372
Damn.

1462
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,208
You need to finish your walk.

1463
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,676
Tabby, hey.

1464
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:17,719
(CLEARS THROAT) All right.

1465
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:19,521
All right, all right,
guys, let's go.

1466
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,589
ROCKS: Yeah.

1467
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,913
GUNDERSON: You liked living
in Hell's Kitchen?

1468
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,515
JAKE: Yeah,
the noodle place.

1469
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:49,150
You remember that... Must have
taken you there a thousand times.

1470
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,886
BILLY: You sure there wasn't one
here on the Lower East side?

1471
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,487
JAKE: No, no, no.
That was a donut shop.

1472
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,989
You're thinking
about a donut place.

1473
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,824
JAKE: Oh, East Village. Remember
that East Village place

1474
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:57,225
with the weird door man?
Sounds like Roland...

1475
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,261
Rudolph.
Rudolph.

1476
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,829
GUNDERSON: The guy was always
giving me mix-tapes.

1477
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:02,697
JAKE: (LAUGHS) Oh, God!

1478
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,099
JAKE: You know, I don't
think I've ever not loved

1479
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:05,901
a neighborhood in this city.

1480
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:09,684
JAKE: (SIGHS) Man, I
really don't wanna leave.

1481
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:11,307
BILLY: Then don't.

1482
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:13,742
BILLY: We could
just go to a park.

1483
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,644
JAKE: It'll be worth it,
trust me.

1484
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:44,773
(SHOUTING)

1485
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:35,256
Okay.

1486
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:37,826
You guys are gonna love this.

1487
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:39,995
Oh, Goddamn it.

1488
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,329
Oh.

1489
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,433
Oh, shit.

1490
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:47,268
That's an interesting choice.

1491
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,671
JAKE: God damn, taggers.
Ruined it.

1492
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,007
My breasts are nice.
When did you make this?

1493
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,075
Couple months ago.

1494
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,445
They're turning the whole
place into a hotel.

1495
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,948
So I kinda had
this stupid idea that

1496
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:03,018
you know, that we could live
on, our legacy or something.

1497
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:05,720
JAKE: (SIGHS) God.

1498
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:08,790
Nothing about this day has turned
out the way I wanted it to.

1499
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,191
Well, the day's not over.

1500
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:13,409
We can salvage this, we'll go
to a bar, have a few drinks.

1501
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,063
I kissed Tabatha.

1502
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:17,799
What?

1503
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,970
Me and Tabatha, we kissed.

1504
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:24,005
What are you talking about?

1505
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:25,907
You did not.
No, we did.

1506
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,709
Fuck you, you did not.

1507
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,445
It happened.

1508
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:32,647
When?

1509
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,416
ROCKS: In her old bedroom.

1510
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,651
Not where. When.

1511
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,293
After dinner.
Okay.

1512
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,455
Why?
I don't know.

1513
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:44,119
I don't know.
Just tell me why?

1514
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:47,162
I'm not mad. I just
want to know why.

1515
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:48,396
Because I'm a fucking
piece of shit.

1516
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,098
Uh-huh.
Why else?

1517
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,100
Jake, Jake, come on, Jake.

1518
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:53,334
I don't know.
Jake, let go.

1519
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:54,669
You fucking know.
I don't.

1520
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:56,438
BILLY: Jake...
You fucking know.

1521
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,606
You do know.
You do know!

1522
01:07:58,608 --> 01:07:59,908
Why did you do it?

1523
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:04,079
BILLY: Come on, Jake, Jake.
Come on, Jake. Jake.

1524
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,450
Smooth, Rocks, really smooth.

1525
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:12,454
It was probably
just a little drunken kiss.

1526
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:14,689
Like a peck.
No.

1527
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:17,091
Sure, I mean, it was a momentary lapse.
You weren't thinking.

1528
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:20,061
I wish that were true.
I do. BILLY: It is.

1529
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:21,463
Jake is overreacting.
And...

1530
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:22,797
No, Billy, stop.

1531
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,065
I know you, you would never...

1532
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:25,733
Stop it.

01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,783
(ALL WHOOPING)

(SPLASHES)

1715
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:55,114
JAKE: Hey, I really appreciate
what you guys did for me today.

1716
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,694
Even you, kinda.

1717
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,330
But...

1718
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:06,266
I'm still leaving.

1719
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:09,670
I have to. I got to move on
I gotta...

1720
01:25:10,072 --> 01:25:12,272
Face the future, you know.

1721
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,310
Good.

1722
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,612
Good?

1723
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:21,381
Good.

1724
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:23,450
Good riddance.
