You must be prepared to work hard

$2 dollars, that's too much.

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,837
No need to push.
There are 250 positions.

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,118
lf you feel this is for you,
it's only $2 to register.

- What are you good at?
- Kung fu and acrobatics.

18
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,278
- But can you use an abacus?
- No problem.

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,554
- Guarantor?
- What?

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,473

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,348

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,150
Pay cash, you're in.
Still want it?

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,435
l only have $25.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,195
Pay the rest later. Report

Hurry, they're going fast.

You're really lucky.

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,830
Line up over here!

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,437
Only $2 registry fee!

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,553
What are you doing here?
This isn't Hansen's cloth factory.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,755
Who took your $2?

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,435
The address is right, but the Hansen
factory doesn't exist.

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,478
lt's not easy to make a living
in Hong Kong.

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,870
Leave now, you've all been conned.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,518
Leave, or l'll call the police.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,474
Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,599
- What do we do now?
- Call it a $2 lesson.

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,116
We were lucky.
l saw some guy pay the man $30.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,476
- That was very bad luck.
- More money than sense.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,479
Hong Kong!

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,759
lt's all arranged.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,637
- Be careful.
- Sure.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,675
Boss, you look bad.

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,910
Uncle Hai, l can't find his medicine.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,676
You forgot the boss's medicine?
One of you must have it.

46
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,159
lmbecile!

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,473
Pretending he's boss.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,279
They forgot your medicine.
We'll postpone the meeting.

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,511
- We mustn't show any weakness.
- lt's not that...

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,633
lf Tiger's reasonable,
don't be too harsh.

51
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,473
You're too kind-hearted
for this business.

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,870
ln our business, it's them or us.

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,394
That's why l have
absolute faith in Fei.

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,357
He's vicious and cold-hearted.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,155
Sunglasses.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,437
- Late, as usual.
- l'm not late.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,308
You were early.

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,872
What's wrong, old man?
You're ill again?

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,555
Cut the small talk.
Why did you call me here today?

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,919
Fine. Remember Yang -
your partner, Mr White?

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,594
Sure l do, but he's dead.

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,276
Yeah, but he and l made a deal. The
Ritz would be split down the middle.

63
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,070
He may have said so, but l never did.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,154
Come on, calm down. You came to talk.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,152
l'm here because as Mr White,

66
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,314
l won't be forced into bargaining
with you pack of liars!

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,872
You're calling me a liar?

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,993
That isn't nice. Open fire!

69
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,277
- Are you all right, boss?
- Get him out of here.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,474
- Would you like to buy a rose, sir?
- No.

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,438
Don't refuse me
this early in the morning.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,475
No, thank you.

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,109
Buying a rose from me
will bring you good luck.

74
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,474
- Your first time in Hong Kong?
- Yes.

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,391
Take care.

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,471
l learnt my lesson yesterday.

77
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,030
l'm afraid you didn't.
Look at your suitcase.

78
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,632
As l said, take care, sir.

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,639
Hey, wait a minute.

80
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,917
l will buy a rose after all.

81
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,270
- Let's hope your luck will change.
- l hope you're right.

82
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,355
Thanks!

83
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,435
Be careful.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,115
Get lost!

85
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,073
What now?

86
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,836
- Don't move!
- l'm just trying to help.

87
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,070
Thanks very much, young man.
Don't move!

88
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,034
Run for it!

89
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,358
- Boss, are you OK?
- How did we get into this mess?

90
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,000
Young man, could you help carry him?

91
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,436
- Who are you?
- We'll pay you $100.

92
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,033
$100?

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,429
Over there!

94
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,075
- Where do l take him?
- Anywhere. Move!

95
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,309
Run!

96
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,828
- Where now?
- Ouch! That hurts.

97
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,639
Put me down.
You're hurting my stomach.

98
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,596
- Put him down first!
- OK.

99
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,718
- Boss, are you OK?
- You...

100
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,639
My...

101
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,516
This way.

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,511
How is your stomach?

103
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,231
Boss, how are you?

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
Tell me who is going
to take your place?

105
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,719
Let him have it.

106
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,031
- Let him have it?
- What's happening?

107
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,954
- Are you sure?
- l want him...

108
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,474
Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss!

109
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,595
You all heard Mr White.
We must obey his wishes.

110
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,956
But we must get out of here.
Let's go, boss.

111
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,591
From now on, you're our boss.

112
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,033
Me?

113
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,954
Being our boss, you don't have to
worry where you live or how you live.

114
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,716
You still don't understand. Look,
you get to have elegant clothes.

115
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,553
You're always fighting,
it's a dangerous job.

116
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,476
- l might as well do it.
- What?!

117
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,236
Don't worry.
Just do as l tell you, you'll be OK.

118
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Why did the boss name this jerk?
You were his right hand man.

119
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,268
lf l'm not the right man for the job,
we'd soon know about it.

120
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,557
lf you're not up to it,
then who is?

121
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,229
Let's wait and see what happens.

122
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,790
Boss, any spare change?

123
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,393
Here, now scram.

124
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,596
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

125
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,193
Keep an eye on things.
We'll go in the back way.

126
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,111
What if nothing happens?

127
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,758
Then fix the car.

128
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,559
Young man, a rose for luck?

129
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,834
Get lost.

130
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,633
l'll buy a rose from her. Hey, lady!

131
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,472
l'll buy a rose from you.

132
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,358
lt's your lucky day, sir.

133
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,193
- There.
- That's very kind. l thank you, sir.

134
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,679
Let's go, boss.

135
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,916
- Why isn't Fei our new boss?
- You really want him up there?

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,877
Who else? You?

137
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,238
Fei's the only man,
otherwise it could be any one of us.

138
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,276
Why not you?

139
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,955
We've got him outnumbered.
He doesn't stand a chance.

140
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,429
lf he's got the guts to fight,
he can show us.

141
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,716
l can't go through with this.
Don't force me.

142
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,349
We won't force you.
You can take the back stairway out.

143
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,235
- Thanks.
- But you must be careful.

144
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,399
Why should l be careful?

145
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,278
lf you leave now,
we can't protect you.

146
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,591
lf Tiger catches you,
they'll make mincemeat of you.

147
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,796
But l helped your boss, remember?

148
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,316
l couldn't figure out why you helped.

149
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,188
lt's odd he chose you,
but l must obey his instructions.

150
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,235
l'm cursed whichever way l turn.

151
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,232
No problem. l'll look out for you.

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,076
Now you even look like the boss.

153
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,353
Here's your speech.

154
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,634
Let's go.

155
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,549
We'll test him.

156
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,789
Don't be afraid.

157
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,235
Brothers, at the request of Mr White,

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,392
l'm here to introduce your new boss,
Kuo Chen Wah.

159
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,998
Uhh...good day to you, friends.

160
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,039
l would like to...

161
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,072
l would like to...

162
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,071
Can't you talk without reading?

163
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,915
l don't know how to be your boss.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,356
ln my opinion you shouldn't
rob banks, or do bad things

165
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,876
like racketeering, killing,
or breaking the law in any...

166
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,589
Our new boss has got a great
sense of humour.

167
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,194
Words are fine, but show us
what you're really made of.

168
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,438
- Show us what he's made of.
- Go on.

169
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,192
- All right?
- OK.

170
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,952
- Look out for him.
- OK.

171
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,148
Go on, then.

172
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,673
Over here, over here!

173
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,469
Don't be shy.

174
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,874
Come on!

175
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,439
Fatty, you be referee.

176
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,715
Settle down.

177
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,869
Move out of the way.

178
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,599
Ready? One, two, three...

179
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,355
Who burnt me?

180
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,634
Don't make excuses.

181
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,748
Well done, boss.

182
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,951
l tell you, somebody burnt me.

183
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,156
Arm wrestling doesn't prove anything.

184
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,435
Otherwise Tom would've been
boss long ago.

185
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,034
ln this business,
you must be able to fight.

186
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
You fight him them.

187
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,151
You're on your own now.

188
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,594
We'll show him.

189
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,111
ls two against one too much for you?

190
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,391
Let me go!

191
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,839
Help him up.

192
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,509
Boss.

193
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,836
- The boss is the winner!
- Well done!

194
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,354
The boss is the winner.

195
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,509
''The King George''

196
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,953
The letter?

197
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,555
- And the paper?
- Here. Write sparingly.

198
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,269
lf the boss finds out, he'll fire me.

199
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,352
l won't waste it.
Here's a rose for luck.

200
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,789
'l was at Mr Chow's party today.

201
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,952
'He was asking after you.

202
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,998
'When l got back to the hotel,
l received your letter.

203
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,470
'l am so happy that your school
friend, lan is so good to you.

204
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,473
'l am very happy for you,
l think he must be very handsome.

205
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,032
'lf you're not too busy, l hope we
can meet in Shanghai later this year.

206
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,873
'We're going to a function
at the lndian Consulate tonight.

207
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,997
'No doubt it will be chicken curry.

208
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,470
'l'm sending you some more money
this month.

209
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,394
'You're getting older now,
so you'll be needing a bit more.

210
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,712
'The weather's getting cold, take
care you don't kick off your covers.

211
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,951
'The chauffeur has just arrived.
l've got to go.

212
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,793
'Sorry to write so little, Mum.'

213
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,839
So we're making a loss and breaking
even? Something must be wrong.

214
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,356
You don't know what Yang is like.
He tricked him in a game of chance.

215
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,513
He lost all his shares in the Ritz.
So l juggled the figures a bit.

216
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,830
Do we have to get involved
in shady deals?

217
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,708
Boss, l'm just following orders. The
brothers won't object if they're fed.

218
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,758
Can you make this restaurant
more profitable?

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,273
l won't run a casino.

220
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,072
A whorehouse, then?

221
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,757
Uncle? Sorry, but there's a Miss Yang
here to see you.

222
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,314
Come in. This is Uncle Hai.

223
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,838
Good day, l'm Luming Yang. My father
used to own half this place.

224
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,754
l believe he died in Shanghai
three months ago.

225
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,795
Yes.

226
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,351
That's why l've come to discuss
the business side of things with you.

227
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,910
This is Mr Kuo Chen Wah.
He's our new boss here.

228
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,790
My father gambled his share
of the restaurant away.

229
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,269
He asked me to find a way
to repay you.

230
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,476
lt's nothing. Forget it.

231
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,716
Wait. He meant
at your own convenience.

232
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,391
l've got some money here.
Can l give you that for now?

233
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,710
Your father owed us thousands.

234
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,113
l could work for you without pay.

235
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,235
As what?

236
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,551
l sang and danced
at a club in Shanghai.

237
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,393
- Why did you leave?
- The club closed.

238
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,948
lt wasn't my fault.
l was very good.

239
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,636
One minute. l'll sing for you.

240
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,553
Hong Kong by night, never sleeps

241
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,835
The Pearl of the Orient that we are

242
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,948
Listen to the symphony of waves
and tides

243
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,150
- lt's not much.
- l got it. Build her up.

244
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,789
- We'll open a nightclub.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

245
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,918
- Up there.
- One, two, three...

246
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,198
Be careful, be careful.

247
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,069
What's the total?

248
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,674
lf l knew how to add,
l would have joined the Navy.

249
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,273
You're crazy!

250
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,318
lt's someone for you.

251
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,436
Mr Jang.

252
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,549
Mister.

253
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,230
You're decorating?

254
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,711
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

255
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,637
Be careful!

256
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,711
Why are you taking so long?

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,951
lf l knew how to write,
l would have joined the airforce.

258
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,993
Are you ready?
Now look at the camera.

259
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,035
Ready.

260
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,511
- Let's go in.
- Welcome!

261
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,830
- Put it there.
- Your reservations, sir?

262
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,912
- Tiger Lo needs no reservations.
- This way, Tiger.

263
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,634
So kind of you to come, Mr Tiger.

264
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,189
You've got a nice place here.

265
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,033
Let me introduce you to our new boss,
Kuo Chen Wah.

266
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,638
Kuo Chen Wah. You're not White, then.
l thought White was your father.

267
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,192
Miss Luming, hurry up.

268
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,391
To what do we owe
the pleasure of this visit?

269
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,517
Relax, this is a social visit.

270
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,514
l see you've spared no expense.

271
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,433
l'm ready to forget Yang's debts.

272
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,751
Give me half of the Ritz.

273
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,071
l think...

274
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,914
- Are you the boss here?
- No, he is.

275
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,675
Then shut up. Well?

276
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,028
Yang's debts are not our business.

277
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,475
You can see we've spent a lot
on the decor.

278
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,471
We don't need outside investment.

279
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,199
Ladies and gentlemen, there's
a great surprise in store tonight.

280
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,874
Luming Yang of Shanghai,
star of Broadway.

281
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,235
l'm usually short-tempered,
but tonight...

282
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,719
Make way, make way!

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,270
- Get the lights on.
- Nobody move.

284
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,070
Stay in your seats. Stop the music.

285
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,720
- Spotlights off.
- Turn on the house lights.

286
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,310
The Chief lnspector Ho
of Hong Kong here.

287
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,156
ldentity cards, ready, please.

288
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,915
- Mr Ho, you are disrupting the show.
- lnspector to you.

289
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,195
lnspector, we have a proper license.

290
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,271
And we have a proper search warrant.

291
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,713
l don't carry a card.

292
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,519
What are you saying? No cards? Why?

293
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,876
- So what?
- lmprisonment, that's what.

294
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,675
How are you, sir?

295
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,832
- How's Mr Laughton, your boss?
- He's well, thank you.

296
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,993
You may leave.
These are all good people.

297
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,351
Have you made the check?

298
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,749
lnspector Ho, you are disturbing
our guests.

299
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,358
l will come here whenever l please.
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

300
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,031
- Are you the licensee?
- No, not me, him.

301
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,316
l'm Kou Chen Wah, the manager.

302
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,913
So you're the new boss?

303
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,788
lt's our opening night.
Excuse us for any shortcoming.

304
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,393
Looks like a boss.

305
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,031
l won't disturb them,
but l would like a word with you.

306
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,189
No problem.

307
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,350
Of course.

308
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,835
Now what?

309
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,711
Stop searching.

310
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,189
Let's go.

311
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,508
Come upstairs.

312
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,832
lnspector Ho, please, sit down.

313
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,914
l didn't come here to sit down,
l came here because l saw something.

314
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,558
Saw something?

315
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,116
Something that doesn't belong here.

316
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,273
You must be mistaken, everything here
is bought and paid for.

317
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,920
- l mean you.
- Me? l don't belong here?

318
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,792
Yes, all the people downstairs
make a living through theft,

319
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,997
deceit and other foul means.

320
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,751
Don't argue with me.

321
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,795
l reckon...

322
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,318
amongst all these people...

323
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,958
the only person who hasn't committed
a crime yet...

324
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,196
l want to save you
from this den of iniquity.

325
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,513
- l want to do you a good turn.
- A good turn?

326
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,273
Yes, from now on...

327
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,955
if you can inform me
of Yang and Tiger's activities,

328
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,600
then l will put them behind bars.

329
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,069
Then you and l...

330
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,631
will create the biggest story to come
out of Hong Kong in its history.

331
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,317
l must wipe them out.
l hope you aren't one of them.

332
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,868
But l have been thinking
of a gradual...

333
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,919
Don't reply now.
Think it over and give me a call.

334
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,116
l don't usually trust people,
but in your case...

335
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,270
Boss, some tea for lnspector Ho.

336
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,114
No need, we won't be bothering you
any further.

337
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,909
- What was that...?
- Sorry, l forgot my hat.

338
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,999
Continue.

339
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,759
- What did he say?
- He told me to behave.

340
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,273
He wouldn't say that.

341
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,875
He must think you are the only
innocent person here.

342
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,076
Did he ask you to do the right thing?

343
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,878
- No.
- Of course he did.

344
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,670
He must have asked you to rat on us
and do Hong Kong a great service.

345
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,751
He must have said
he didn't trust anyone

346
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,478
and you shouldn't miss the boat.

347
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,596
So you know what he told me?

348
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,193
Notjust me. Everyone knows.

349
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,396
Even the door man.

350
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,272
Back to base!

351
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,836
Sorry about the interruption.
Continue the music.

352
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,474
Let's give Luming a big hand.

353
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,990
Ask your boss to have a drink.
This is all water under the bridge.

354
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,038
We don't want to start a war.

355
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,714
Very few people
are as peace-loving as you.

356
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,997
lf l was boss, l'd prefer peace too.

357
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,675
Kuo is too young
and Hai is too sneaky.

358
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,228
- Pass on the message.
- lf that's all, l'll leave.

359
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,678
All debts are paid.
Here are the lOU's.

360
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,398
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

361
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,756
- Tong's still out buying roses.
- What for? lt's not a proposal.

362
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,159
Chen Wah.

363
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,037
What is it?

364
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,556
- Have you thought about the future?
- l have thought about it.

365
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,358
Everybody's waiting.

366
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,477
Wait till l come back.
Wait three years anyway.

367
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,908
Hey!

368
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,433
Hey!

369
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,475
Three years!

370
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,314
Don't you know the Black Tiger gang
had 7 bosses in three years?

371
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,476
l can't find Madam Kao.

372
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,073
Can't you go without roses?

373
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,358
- That's not the point.
- Fine, get started. Get in.

374
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,797
l wish you good luck.

375
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,279
Thank you, miss.

376
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,112
- lsn't it beautiful?
- Lovely.

377
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,556
You people cover the back alley.

378
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,234
- Rush in when l throw the cup.
- OK.

379
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,799
Wait a minute.

380
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,719
Tidy up.

381
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,832
Kid, you do have it.
Sit down, please.

382
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,515
Quick, stay alert.

383
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,398
Don't nag me again.

384
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,472
Now you're here,
some good will come of this.

385
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:22,240
Sign here, and you go home safely.
With not a hair missing.

386
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,436
Half of the Ritz?

387
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,830
Whatever has happened
between us in the past,

388
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,118
sign here and we'll be brothers.
Understand?

389
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,955
Yes, but...

390
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,512
Are you qualified to sign?
lf not, shut up.

391
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,638
- l'll sign.
- Now you are talking.

392
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,994
With one more clause -

393
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,278
we get half your income from
the casinos then - unconditionally.

394
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,552
Repeat what you said, young man?

395
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,755
Say that again.

396
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,758
Go on.

397
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,869
You take half the Ritz,
we're entitled to half your assets.

398
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,113
Don't move!

399
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,677
Fools! Ten Shantung men
can't beat two Cantonese?

400
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,719
Useless morons!
What are you doing with your guns?

401
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,031
Put the guns away, you idiots!

402
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,355
Young man, if you've got the balls,
come outside with me.

403
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,995
lf you're going to hit me, kill me.

404
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,273
You old rotten egg!

405
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,954
Boss is in trouble.

406
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,313
You're good, young one.

407
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,636
- Pick him up.
- Move it.

408
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,795
Let's go.

409
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,991
Don't push. l'll go myself.

410
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,516
- Go, quick.
- Hurry up.

411
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,870
Give me half the Ritz
and l'll set them free.

412
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,475
Let's go.

413
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,398
Police.

414
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,829
Finished fighting? Seems we're late.

415
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,956
What did you say, lnspector Ho?

416
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,351
Mr Tiger, was there
fighting going on here?

417
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,673
l don't understand your dialect.
Speak Cantonese.

418
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,239
Cantonese?

419
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,029
lt seems there was a fight here.
l'm sure you weren't involved.

420
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,588
A fight? l didn't see anything.

421
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,517
- Nothing?
- No.

422
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,835
You saw nothing.
Are you under duress?

423
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,717
We were having tea and a chat.

424
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,591
Well, our tea and chats are over.
See you some other day.

425
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,795
Any time.

426
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,038
Tell me he threatened you
and l'll have him arrested.

427
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,510
lnspector Ho, l don't understand.

428
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,115
You're refusing to cooperate,
next time l may be too late.

429
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,715
Now l understand. Goodbye.

430
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,593
That's it, then. Let's go.

431
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,352
They were fighting.
Do you believe he was having tea?

432
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,589
l'm not blind.

433
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,954
Mission over.

434
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,359
Dismissed.

435
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,873
The lnspector saved the day,
not the rose.

436
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,757
l won't go anywhere without a rose.

437
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,875
Superstition.

438
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,071
Uncle, do we need to repair the car?

439
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,309
Yes, you and the car.

440
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,038
An overhaul is expensive.

441
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,914
l suspect Fei is behind
the whole thing.

442
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,319
You suspect him?

443
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,598
He's an old-timer and knows the ropes
well, yet he failed miserably.

444
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,398
So you question Fei's loyalty?

445
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,392
ln our business,
there's one thing we can't forget...

446
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,757
trust no-one.

447
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,398
l don't like it.

448
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,596
You don't have much choice.

449
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,751
- Do you want this?
- No.

450
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,110
- Where are you going?
- To the States.

451
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,031
Without consulting me?

452
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,190
You never gave me a chance to talk.

453
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,714
You only have time for fights
and business.

454
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,918
You take a holiday. lt's OK.

455
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,797
l'm not coming back.

456
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,278
What? Why?

457
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,192
- l want to get married.
- l told you, it's impossible.

458
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,113
With whom?

459
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,599
With Mr Lu.

460
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,275
His parents in the States are dying
for him to get married.

461
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,069
You think nobody wants me.
Don't try to stop me.

462
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,673
You can't leave!

463
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,230
- Why can't l go?
- You can't. Listen to me.

464
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,799
- You are rotten!
- Help me, please.

465
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,235
lt's none of my business. Carry on.

466
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,356
lf you leave what will happen to us?

467
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,796
All you care about is business.
You never have time for me.

468
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,075
Who do you think l am?
The piggy bank?

469
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,436
l never treated you like that.
Hey, help me out here.

470
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,555
What can l do?

471
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,473
- How do we treat her?
- As the piggy bank, of course.

472
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,835
He said it. Don't deny it again.

473
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,559
He's lying. Don't believe him.

474
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,835
Right, l lied.
What lies should l tell now?

475
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,515
Lies? You fool!
Lady, you know well how l treat you.

476
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,635
How do you treat me?

477
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,709
You know.

478
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,078
l don't know. You usually mumble,
l don't know what you're saying.

479
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,479
You're driving me crazy.

480
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,118
Lady, lady...

481
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,590
Lady, are you really going
to drop everything and leave?

482
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,558
lt's now or never. Should l wait
till you are riddled with holes?

483
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,392
Fiddlesticks!

484
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,038
Did l say something wrong?

485
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,998
l just heard wrong.
lt's none of my business.

486
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,753
None of your business?
All you do is drink. She's leaving.

487
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,558
That is my business. Stop her.

488
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,315
Lady, please, give me two more years.

489
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,799
You think l'd trust you?!

490
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,950
- l really mean it.
- You really mean it?

491
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,708
Let go of me!

492
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,311
Lady, lady, please, stay.

493
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,879
You lied to me.

494
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,349
No, l didn't.

495
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,955
l paid you back money
which my father didn't even owe you!

496
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,509
l worked hard for you. What have you
got to say for yourself?

497
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,272
l told him not to cheat you.

498
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,588
l've never objected.

499
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,193
He said the same thing.

500
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,955
At first, l didn't know you well.
Later, l didn't know how to begin.

501
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,235
The money is intact.
l'll pay you back.

502
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,153
So you cheated because he said so.

503
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,037
l didn't know you then.

504
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,951
Now you know how to shift blame.

505
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,473
Shut up, you!

506
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,677
Forget it. l don't want the money.
l'm going.

507
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,638
- Lady, listen to me.
- Let go of me.

508
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,749
Listen to me.

509
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,713
Boss.

510
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,074
Mr Lu wants to know
when we are leaving.

511
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,275
None of your business.

512
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,555
No, l've come to report
the engine's dead.

513
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,039
Tell him to go away.

514
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,189
How can they leave?

515
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,953
Yeah, how can they leave,
do l have to push them?

516
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,678
Tell Mr Lu to leave.

517
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,352
Tell Mr Lu to leave.

518
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,556
Tell him to leave, OK.

519
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,871
You depend on others for decisions.

520
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,837
Only when they are right.

521
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,354
- Lady.
- Let me go.

522
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,908
Lady, you can't go!

523
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,509
Don't go.

524
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,589
Give me a reason to stay.

525
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,796
A reason? What reason?

526
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,757
We don't act on reason.

527
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,671
You drink too much.

528
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,711
Are you all right? l'm really sorry.

529
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,274
l'm really sorry.

530
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,670
Boss, Mr Lu insists
on seeing Luming first.

531
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,990
- What then?
- Gun him down.

532
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,559
Shoot him dead.

533
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,029
- Let me get up.
- Please don't leave.

534
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,955
You can't trap her like a thief.
Kiss her, then she'll stay.

535
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,989
- Kiss her?
- And you refuse to listen.

536
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,433
l do, l do.

537
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,679
He'll leave now.

538
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,918
l'll go and clean the car.

539
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,790
Don't touch me.

540
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,671
Lady, l am sorry.

541
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,875
Baggage in hand? Going on holiday?

542
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,351
l tried to send your letter,
but l was caught and sacked.

543
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,477
- Where's the letter?
- The manager took it.

544
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,512
- Mr Manager.
- Manager, she wants to see you.

545
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,589
Yes?

546
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,355
You have a Shanghai letter
addressed to Mrs Kao, it's mine.

547
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,032
Yours?

548
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,352
But you don't live here.
How come there's a letter for you?

549
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,192
l used your headed note paper.

550
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,358
- Kick her out.
- Mr Manager, Mr Manager...

551
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,591
l'm in dire need of the letter.
Please give it to me.

552
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,798
l was wrong to use your letterhead.
l won't do it again.

553
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,474
l won't do it again.
Please, give me my letter.

554
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,028
Stop it. ls there a letter for her?

555
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,917
There was but l returned it.

556
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,671
No, that letter was non-returnable.

557
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,318
He's taking it to the post.

558
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,469
- Madam!
- My letter, my letter!

559
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,111
Go back to work.

560
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,990
Nothing. Sorry for the disturbance.

561
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,671
Thank you.

562
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,116
- Leave now.
- Thank you.

563
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,997
Thank you very much.

564
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,431
You've fixed everything. l'm going
to have some tea downstairs.

565
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,876
Let's shake hands and be friends.

566
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,157
l don't know
if he will accept your offer.

567
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,714
l don't think he's a bad person.

568
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,909
You think you know best.
We have a proverb, even pigs can fly.

569
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,879
So where are you from?

570
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,630
Me? The most honest
of Cantonese people.

571
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,792
Remember, morning tea.

572
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,438
l'd better be going.

573
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,115
Cantonese, Shandong people,
they're all the same.

574
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,993
l'll say it once more for you.

575
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,998
Chicken George used to work
on the docks.

576
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,277
l know. He has hundreds
of dockers working on the harbour.

577
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,839
He is very powerful.

578
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,713
When you see him,
don't be too humble.

579
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,952
l know, the dockers are always
delivering goods to Wan Chai.

580
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,514
What are you up to? More business?

581
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,477
You know the Black Dragons have
invited me to dinner, l have to go.

582
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,996
When he's talking to me,
can you not look at him, please?

583
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,754
Boss, l got it.
l bought the chrysanthemum.

584
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,515
- A chrysanthemum? Are you new?
- Chrysanths' are flowers too.

585
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,431
You fool, go out and clean the car.

586
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,272
A flower is a flower.

587
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,831
Hurry up. Time's short.
No flowers. They're waiting.

588
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,478
Don't be so superstitious.

589
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,718
Let's go.

590
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,031
No, no rose, no meeting.

591
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,353
l know you're looking at him.

592
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,836
l'm glad you have your own ideas.

593
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,153
Boss, we can't find Madam Kao.

594
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,879
- l was told she's sick at home.
- Sick?

595
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,753
Mr Wah, this way please.

596
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,954
Mr Wah.

597
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,638
This way.

598
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,679
OK, the flower's here. We must go.

599
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,518
l've come to buy a flower.
Are you all right?

600
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,238
Take your medicine.

601
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,475
- Has she got a temperature?
- No, she feels cold.

602
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,799
lt's not the flu. This is no use.

603
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,670
Give the boss a flower.
He needs it for luck.

604
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,311
Have you ever thought of giving
others some luck? You're inhuman.

605
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,917
Get a doctor here fast.

606
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,629
Boss, doctors are useless.
She's heartbroken.

607
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,271
Tell me who did it and he's dead.
Tell me and l'll cut him to pieces.

608
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,433
Tell me, l'll see if l can help.

609
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,519
Who is this?

610
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,477
That's her daughter.

611
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,313
l don't believe it.
She's so beautiful.

612
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,038
Sorry, l didn't mean it.

613
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,157
Forget about it.

614
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,118
Stop crying.

615
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,236
- l know. Her daughter's dead.
- Shut up.

616
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,152
Go and clean the car.

617
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,915
Hey, it's time now, we must go.

618
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,353
How can we leave?

619
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,471
The dockers may be offended.

620
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,915
- Let me buy the flowers first.
- Then buy them...

621
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,233
Mr Kuo, this is for you -
to bring you and everyone luck.

622
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,277
l hope you are all lucky.

623
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,030
You should be glad
you have such a pretty daughter.

624
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,792
Where is she?

625
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,432
Any way we can help?

626
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,594
Her daughter is studying in Shanghai.
She's coming back to see her mother.

627
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,875
Wonderful. Does she have money
for the ticket?

628
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,313
l'll buy it for you.

629
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,837
She's coming with her boyfriend
and his father

630
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,515
to discuss details of their marriage.

631
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,592
Madam Kao never let her know
about the flowers.

632
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,229
She left to study at a young age.

633
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,914
She was told not to worry about money

634
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,798
because her mother
is well known in Hong Kong.

635
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,472
She said she lived at King's.

636
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,951
Now if the daughter knows the truth,
she'll be very disappointed...

637
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,556
and if the father and son know,
there would be no marriage.

638
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,119
Tell me what l can do.

639
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,997
Only you can help.

640
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,389
You are the only one.

641
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,790
You are obliged to help her
as her rose brought you good luck.

642
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,108
How can l help her?

643
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,515
Easy, send her to King's
and give her a makeover.

644
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,392
Easy to say. That takes money.

645
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,079
We've raised some money for her.

646
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,355
Here's it is.
Do you think it's enough?

647
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,392
lt's OK. There's no need for that.

648
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,392
l'll do whatever you say.

649
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,394
l have to leave.

650
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,475
- No need to worry, you have me.
- l don't know how to thank you.

651
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,957
You sort it out.

652
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,070
- Why bother with this?
- lt's easy. l'm glad to help.

653
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,714
- This way.
- Miss Yang, everything's set.

654
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,756
Take care of Madam Kao.

655
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,912
So beautiful.

656
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,313
- Bring the things in.
- Yes.

657
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,399
Miss Yang, is everything OK?

658
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,517
Say yes if anyone asks
if Madam Kao lives here.

659
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,353
But say you don't know
if they ask about her.

660
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,029
Madam, welcome to your new home.

661
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,432
Chen Wah, over here.

662
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,911
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Very.

663
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,228
Money buys everything.

664
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,713
l really don't know how to thank you
for all this wonderful help.

665
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,394
- Mr Kuo loves to help people, right?
- Yes.

666
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,516
Miss Yang, all your people are here.

667
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,555
Come in.

668
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,755
Please.

669
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,398
Who are they?

670
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,917
This is the beautician, the tailor,
the hairdresser. All for you.

671
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,392
Afternoon tea is ready.

672
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,200
- Who's he?
- The butler.

673
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,554
The butler?

674
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,153
Mr Kuo, this way.

675
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,879
Madam Kao deserves a butler.

676
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,915
- Uncle, we're leaving.
- Thank you.

677
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,753
- You've everything under control?
- Absolutely.

678
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,192
- What?
- We need a husband.

679
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,192
- What husband?
- She said she had one.

680
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,111
- What should we do?
- Find her one.

681
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,919
Me, find her a husband?
Where will l get one of them?

682
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,672
Don't ask me.

683
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,398
Children mean a husband.

684
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,713
A husband?

685
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,109
Don't get me involved.

686
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,515
Miss, where will l find one?

687
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,512
Miss, l have the perfect candidate.

688
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,079
- Who?
- A friend of mine.

689
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,479
ls he suitable?

690
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,120
Never mind that, get him here fast.

691
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,673
Then you stay.

692
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,278
l'll play any part for money.

693
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,478
Follow me.

694
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,708
l'd sign anything to live here.

695
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,872
Mr Kuo, this is my friend, Mr Tong.

696
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,195
From now on, he's your boss.

697
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,794
Kuo Chen Wah, Mr Kuo.

698
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,358
Haven't we met before?

699
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,793
No.

700
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,916
Go over and greet Mr Kuo.

701
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,470
- Mr Kuo, how do you do?
- How do you do?

702
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,074
- l did meet you some time ago.
- lmpossible.

703
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,514
Thank you. Gentlemen, Madam Kao.

704
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,158
She's your wife.

705
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,390
Don't be nervous. Relax.

706
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,115
Mr Kuo.

707
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,910
When are you going to introduce me?

708
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,039
Miss Yang,
this is the husband, Mr Tong.

709
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:07,309
You? Come here,
let's see you together. Not bad.

710
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,628
l just need clothes.

711
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,995
Have you finished yet?

712
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,390
- Luming, all done. Can l go?
- You may.

713
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,357
- We're leaving.
- Go home first.

714
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,232
You can't go just yet.

715
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,390
What? ls there anything else?

716
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,349
- We're meeting the ship tomorrow.
- l don't need to be there.

717
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,998
See this thing through.

718
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,037
- Right.
- OK, you can go now.

719
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,395
- Let's talk it over.
- Tea over there.

720
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,074
Why are you staring?
lt's only Madam Kao.

721
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,116
l remember who he is.

722
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,718
l know who you are.

723
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,879
Let bygones be bygones.
l am the husband now.

724
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,518
- What is it now?
- Nothing.

725
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,474
What's the matter?

726
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,835
Nothing, l saved him once.

727
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,797
Let's have some tea.

728
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,039
The ship's docked, boss.

729
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,473
Hurry up.

730
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,033
We're all up front.

731
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,634
- What will Belle say?
- She will be delighted.

732
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,029
- l owe it all to you.
- lt was nothing.

733
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,348
She's docking.

734
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,232
She's arrived.

735
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,033
Have you got it?

736
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,277
''Welcome, Mr Wong''

737
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,432
- Why is it so small?
- l was late back.

738
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,671
- Should have used a business card!
- Why are you late?

739
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,069
There's a bigger sign over there!

740
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,389
- There's someone else meeting Wong.
- lf you can so can they.

741
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,994
Madam Kao is well known.

742
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,356
We can't let them meet her
or we'll be finished.

743
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,034
- What now?
- What now?

744
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,953
- We mustn't let them meet.
- Tell them to leave.

745
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,989
He bumped into me!

746
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,514
Remember, he's my teacher's
old friend, so behave yourself.

747
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,518
l couldn't get rid of them.
lt's lnspector Ho.

748
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,113
You sort it out.

749
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,199
- lnspector you must listen.
- What is it?

750
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,430
Do you want to know
what Tiger is up to?

751
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,953
- What?
- Not here.

752
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,191
- ln the station.
- l've come to meet the ship.

753
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,430
My information will be useless later.

754
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,077
Then tell me now.

755
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,593
l told you, not here.

756
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,272
Whisper it in my ear, then.

757
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,112
Forget about it.

758
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,951
- All fixed?
- Yes, taken care of.

759
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,032
- You two, follow me.
- OK.

760
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,589
Robbery!

761
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,429
He touched me up.

762
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,073
Don't get involved.
Hold up the banner.

763
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,118
Nobody's molesting you.

764
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,999
Hey, what a coincidence!

765
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,389
- How's the kid?
- Fine. What brings you here?

766
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,913
l'm looking for a fight.

767
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,438
- Where is Ma's money?
- l sent it.

768
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,509
You have?

769
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,431
Stop fighting!

770
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,112
Hit him!

771
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,316
Hit him! Hit him!

772
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,197
Go over there and kill him.

773
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,477
lt's none of our business.
Hold the banner. Higher.

774
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,234
- ls Chief lnspector Ho here?
- That's me.

775
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,039
So it's you. You piece of shit!

776
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,638
- Why are you two up to?
- We're meeting the ship.

777
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,711
Not any more. After him!

778
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,476
Don't let him get away!

779
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,475
- Can you see her?
- No.

780
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,754
Do you recognise her?

781
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
There are so many people.

782
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,949
- Do you recognise her?
- l only saw her photo. l don't know.

783
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,275
- Can you see her?
- No.

784
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,959
Can you see her?

785
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,433
Belle.

786
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,712
- Belle!
- Mum! Mum!

787
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,399
That's Belle, my daughter, up there.

788
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,036
l see my mother. She's down there.

789
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,599
OK, OK, let's go.

790
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,636
- Which one is she?
- l'm not sure.

791
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,312
My dear daughter, she's back.

792
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,517
- Where is she?
- l'm not sure.

793
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,270
- Which one is she?
- l don't know.

794
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,557
Can you see?

795
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,359
l heard Mr Wong is very rich.

796
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,192
Take plenty of photos.

797
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,710
- What's that about?
- l'm not sure.

798
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,599
- Boss, boss.
- Let him go. What's the matter?

799
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,148
Two reporters have come
to interview Wong.

800
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,229
Reporters?

801
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,356
- Tie them up.
- OK.

802
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,272
That's against the law.

803
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,994
- We're detectives.
- What are you doing here?

804
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,197
We're reporters.
We've come to interview Mr Wong.

805
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,431
- We'd like a word.
- But the passengers are coming.

806
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,318
- We're not asking.
- Come or take a voluntary holiday.

807
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,550
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?

808
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,273
Do l look all right?

809
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,713
You look fine.

810
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,394
Mum!

811
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,149
Belle!

812
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,350
Look, you did a good thing there.

813
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,158
This is just the beginning.

814
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,320
This is your stepfather.

815
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,114
- lntroduce us to your friends.
- Right.

816
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,590
This is Mr Wong Hsin-chuan.

817
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,672
- Mr Wong, we've heard about you.
- This is my son.

818
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,512
How are you?

819
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,319
Thank you for looking after Belle.

820
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,631
lt's she who looks after me.

821
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,678
lt's too noisy here.
Let's go back to the hotel.

822
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,193
And this is?

823
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,430
- This is her cousin.
- Right, right.

824
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,715
- An Uncle on my mother's side.
- Uncle.

825
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,758
- This is my wife.
- Auntie.

826
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,513
Mummy, you never mentioned
this cousin before.

827
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,999
He was the black sheep in the family.
Marriage changed all that.

828
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,720
Mr Wong, Mr Wong,
let's go back to the hotel.

829
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,431
l'm meeting other friends here.

830
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,478
l've told everyone
to go to the hotel.

831
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,915
Let's go.

832
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,628
- Uncle?!
- Why weren't you introduced?

833
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,153
l'll start the car.

834
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,750
lf you don't get a pay rise,
it could mean exploitation.

835
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,877
Exploitation makes you feel worthless
and that can lead to suicide.

836
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,872
Suicide means you're gone.
What do you think so far?

837
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,633
The missing reporters
are valuable employees.

838
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,950
l am your boss Laughton's old friend.

839
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,589
Stupid conjecture may lead
to yourjob disappearing!

840
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,158
l'm sorry, l just wanted to get
some background information on them.

841
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,078
Trying to put pressure on me.
l've a job to do.

842
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,193
Divide this.

843
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,396
- Miss Yang.
- Miss Yang.

844
01:01:41,636 --> 01:01:44,628
You're going to see the boat people
trying to sell...

845
01:01:44,716 --> 01:01:46,672
lt's so hot.

846
01:01:46,756 --> 01:01:51,113
Let me tell you something nice.
Watching them makes me very happy.

847
01:01:51,196 --> 01:01:52,754
They want us...

848
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:55,304
Right. Tell Tong
to drive us around tomorrow.

849
01:01:55,396 --> 01:01:56,715
You tell him.

850
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,310
He's your man. You tell him.

851
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:00,988
Have you finished?

852
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:02,714
He hopes we'll go easy on him.

853
01:02:02,796 --> 01:02:05,185
But we've never been hard on him.

854
01:02:05,276 --> 01:02:09,235
Hey, Tong,
take Mr Wong sightseeing tomorrow.

855
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,795
What about a boat trip?

856
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:15,473
Whatever! Just don't be seen.

857
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:20,229
Have you finished?
We've got business to discuss.

858
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:28,106
- Call lnspector Ho for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

859
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:34,194
Tomorrow we'll take a drive
to the Peak, and then the Gardens.

860
01:02:34,276 --> 01:02:36,710
Don't forget the camera.
We'll have...

861
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:40,345
Don't walk about like that,
you're making me ill.

862
01:02:40,436 --> 01:02:41,835
l want to.

863
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,031
Now don't forget.

864
01:02:44,116 --> 01:02:47,665
The boat people who we left
asked us to entertain...

865
01:02:47,756 --> 01:02:49,394
Mr Kuo, please.

866
01:02:50,076 --> 01:02:51,589
Boss, the telephone.

867
01:02:56,636 --> 01:02:58,786
You're using my shoe as an ashtray?

868
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:03,747
Mr Wong wants me to get
Chief lnspector Ho.

869
01:03:03,836 --> 01:03:08,193
Where can l find
an lnspector Ho for him?

870
01:03:10,436 --> 01:03:14,748
- What's wrong?
- l thought you'd fixed everything.

871
01:03:15,436 --> 01:03:18,030
- ls that my call?
- Yes.

872
01:04:11,156 --> 01:04:12,305
Fixed.

873
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:24,475
l'll go clean the car.

874
01:04:24,876 --> 01:04:29,188
- Are Filipino maids popular here?
- lt's becoming fashionable.

875
01:04:29,276 --> 01:04:31,665
They're hard to come by.

876
01:04:36,156 --> 01:04:40,195
There is so little money.
Why should they have first choice?

877
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,552
Fei, you can take it, but we can't.

878
01:04:43,636 --> 01:04:47,549
You've helped us for so many years.
We won't forget it, will we?

879
01:04:47,636 --> 01:04:50,548
You can have anything you want.
Just say the word.

880
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,513
l thank you for your goodwill.

881
01:04:52,596 --> 01:04:55,952
Have faith in me.
Better days are ahead. Let's go.

882
01:04:58,236 --> 01:04:59,191
Let's go.

883
01:04:59,356 --> 01:05:00,755
Where's Snake Ming?

884
01:05:00,836 --> 01:05:03,828
He left without saying
where he was going.

885
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:05,827
- Have they found Wong?
- Not yet.

886
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:06,951
Who did you call?

887
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,345
My cousin,
he works for the shipping company.

888
01:05:09,436 --> 01:05:11,313
He's checking the passenger list.

889
01:05:11,956 --> 01:05:14,390
- lnspector.
- Where did you go?

890
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:16,785
The Five Continents Hotel,
Luk Kwok Hotel...

891
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:20,152
ls our Mr Wong at the Five Continents
or Luk Kwok?

892
01:05:20,236 --> 01:05:22,704
- Neither.
- Then why did you go there?

893
01:05:22,796 --> 01:05:25,071
Then later l found out
he was at King's.

894
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:27,954
Then why did you go
to the other places?

895
01:05:28,036 --> 01:05:29,947
- l've got it.
- Got what?

896
01:05:30,036 --> 01:05:33,233
Wong's already here,
so l'll check the hotel.

897
01:05:33,316 --> 01:05:36,706
Who told you to check on Wong?
Find the reporters for me.

898
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:39,267
Why do l have to do everything?

899
01:05:56,516 --> 01:05:58,825
l've never lied in my life.

900
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,069
l'm really scared.

901
01:06:07,236 --> 01:06:09,466
We mustn't disappoint them.

902
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:21,195
Uncle, you're more than an hour late.
Tiger means business.

903
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:24,112
Do you think Tiger will trick us?

904
01:06:24,196 --> 01:06:27,472
- Our boys will be watching.
- l have to get my lucky rose.

905
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:34,549
- Tiger's been waiting all morning.
- We'll invite him for lunch.

906
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:37,274
He wants to see you now.

907
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:40,744
l must get my rose first.

908
01:06:42,676 --> 01:06:43,631
Boss.

909
01:06:44,236 --> 01:06:45,715
A couple of Tiger's stooges.

910
01:06:45,796 --> 01:06:47,912
They've got some nerve,
walking in here.

911
01:06:51,516 --> 01:06:52,710
What's up?

912
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:56,425
- Our boss doesn't like waiting.
- So l'll invite him for dinner.

913
01:06:56,516 --> 01:06:57,665
Freeze!

914
01:06:57,756 --> 01:07:01,066
- Stay there!
- Come with us, Tiger's orders.

915
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:05,235
Look, guys...this is our turf.

916
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,634
l'll go with them.
You and the boys...

917
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,704
You dare make trouble here?
Tie them up!

918
01:07:15,676 --> 01:07:18,395
l'll buy my rose,
then l'll see your boss.

919
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:19,465
Let's go.

920
01:07:20,596 --> 01:07:22,268
Tiger will get you for this.

921
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:26,555
So you're planning
to issue stocks here?

922
01:07:26,636 --> 01:07:28,115
That's the idea.

923
01:07:28,196 --> 01:07:29,914
The door! When?

924
01:07:30,716 --> 01:07:31,990
Very soon, l hope.

925
01:07:33,756 --> 01:07:34,791
Gentlemen.

926
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:38,471
We're associates of Mr Wong's.
ls he in?

927
01:07:39,116 --> 01:07:43,792
- Mr Wong is not here right now.
- We were told he was in his suite.

928
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:46,907
He's breakfasting right now.

929
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,794
- We're good friends of his.
- Long time associates.

930
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:54,352
Just the man. These are
Mr Wong's business associates.

931
01:07:55,516 --> 01:07:58,155
- What now?
- l don't do anything illegal.

932
01:08:04,716 --> 01:08:06,069
That's kidnapping.

933
01:08:06,156 --> 01:08:08,624
- Close the door.
- How many have you tied up now?

934
01:08:10,996 --> 01:08:12,952
You own a steel foundry as well?

935
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:15,547
Good morning, good morning.

936
01:08:15,636 --> 01:08:17,115
You're very early today.

937
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:19,312
Mr Wong, is everything
to your liking?

938
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:20,954
Fine, very comfortable.

939
01:08:21,996 --> 01:08:23,668
Mr Wong likes it here.

940
01:08:23,756 --> 01:08:27,226
- ls everything OK, cousins?
- Of course.

941
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:29,307
Fresh roses. They're lovely.

942
01:08:29,916 --> 01:08:31,986
A rose to bring you luck.

943
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:33,555
Why do you give him a rose?

944
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:37,148
Tradition, it's a family custom.

945
01:08:37,236 --> 01:08:39,704
- A tradition.
- A family tradition.

946
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:42,435
- Wait! Come back down!
- Not so loud.

947
01:08:42,516 --> 01:08:45,030
lnspector Ho is coming up
with two others.

948
01:08:45,116 --> 01:08:47,584
Mr Kuo, an urgent call for you.

949
01:08:47,676 --> 01:08:49,075
l'll take it there.

950
01:08:52,076 --> 01:08:55,830
lnspector Ho is on his way up.

951
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:57,588
He's already in the lift.

952
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:00,465
What do we do now?

953
01:09:01,796 --> 01:09:04,788
Cousin. Cousin.

954
01:09:06,156 --> 01:09:07,111
He's calling you.

955
01:09:07,196 --> 01:09:09,790
- You forgot our business deal.
- Today?

956
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:11,070
They're on the phone.

957
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,916
l'd completely forgotten about it.

958
01:09:17,876 --> 01:09:19,707
He's so busy.

959
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:22,629
Give me some clothes.

960
01:09:22,716 --> 01:09:24,354
lnspector Ho's on his way up.

961
01:09:25,196 --> 01:09:27,266
This way. Take this.

962
01:09:28,436 --> 01:09:29,425
And this.

963
01:09:36,996 --> 01:09:38,748
Go on, follow him. lnside.

964
01:09:41,196 --> 01:09:42,629
Mr Wong, sir.

965
01:09:44,236 --> 01:09:46,670
Tell them l'll be home by noon.

966
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,314
Mr Wong, l'd recognise you anywhere.

967
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,476
You are sharp.
You must be the famous lnspector Ho.

968
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,275
At your service, sir.

969
01:09:56,356 --> 01:09:59,871
Have you been that busy
you couldn't come to the dock?

970
01:09:59,956 --> 01:10:01,992
Oh, but l was. Let me explain.

971
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:04,146
Come with me. l'm on my way out.

972
01:10:04,716 --> 01:10:06,911
- Butler, that's all.
- Yes, sir.

973
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:12,510
- Who are they?
- My assistants.

974
01:10:14,116 --> 01:10:15,947
They've gone.

975
01:10:26,276 --> 01:10:28,028
That's that taken care of!

976
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,667
Tiger is on our backs
and you're still prancing about!

977
01:10:31,756 --> 01:10:35,351
lt may not bother you,
but it bothers me.

978
01:10:36,356 --> 01:10:38,665
You taught me to how to dress,

979
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:42,908
how to walk, how to talk,
how to negotiate, how to fight.

980
01:10:42,996 --> 01:10:46,352
You treat me like a puppet.
Aren't you bothered about that?

981
01:10:46,436 --> 01:10:47,710
He's right. The car.

982
01:10:47,796 --> 01:10:50,868
- That's what you should be doing.
- That's what you think.

983
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:54,346
- What do you think you should do?
- What l'm doing right now.

984
01:10:54,436 --> 01:10:57,428
- This makes you happy?
- Do l look happy?

985
01:10:58,596 --> 01:11:01,429
- Continue with what you're doing.
- l will.

986
01:11:01,516 --> 01:11:04,633
- Go on, then.
- l would if l knew what l was doing.

987
01:11:05,676 --> 01:11:07,667
lmported goods are excellent here.

988
01:11:07,756 --> 01:11:09,986
- Have you got any currency?
- Not yet.

989
01:11:10,076 --> 01:11:12,192
- l'll lend you some.
- How kind.

990
01:11:12,276 --> 01:11:15,074
- When are you floating your company?
- Soon.

991
01:11:15,156 --> 01:11:18,148
He's worth a fortune.
He even owns a goldmine.

992
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:19,954
And the shipyard and the steelworks.

993
01:11:20,036 --> 01:11:23,153
Go and find the reporters.
l'll handle this.

994
01:11:24,476 --> 01:11:26,910
Mr Wong, how much
are the shares worth?

995
01:11:26,996 --> 01:11:29,635
One dollar.
$2.80 once they're floated.

996
01:11:29,716 --> 01:11:31,547
Double your selling price?

997
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:34,628
- There are no outside buyers.
- Can l buy some?

998
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:38,428
You're not an outsider, nephew.

999
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:40,427
Nephew, l'm one of them.

1000
01:11:42,796 --> 01:11:48,587
lnspector Ho, Chairman of
the planning committee, police club.

1001
01:11:48,676 --> 01:11:53,227
That's the police club.
l'm in charge of fundraising.

1002
01:11:53,316 --> 01:11:57,389
Nephew, your charitable deeds
are praiseworthy indeed.

1003
01:11:57,476 --> 01:12:00,354
- Very good, very good.
- Thank you.

1004
01:12:10,756 --> 01:12:12,474
Are you all right?

1005
01:12:12,556 --> 01:12:13,545
l'm just sighing.

1006
01:12:13,636 --> 01:12:17,515
lt's no use sighing.
You must enjoy life.

1007
01:12:17,596 --> 01:12:20,747
l'm sighing
because the club needs $80,000,

1008
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,669
but we've only raised $15,000
in 3 years.

1009
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,907
That's only about $60,000
short of the target.

1010
01:12:26,996 --> 01:12:30,989
After the stocks are issued,
l'll see what l can do to help.

1011
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:33,112
Mr Wong... l'm sorry.

1012
01:12:33,956 --> 01:12:36,948
l know all it takes
is one word from you.

1013
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:41,109
You're so clumsy.

1014
01:12:48,276 --> 01:12:50,665
My son will treat Belle well.

1015
01:12:50,756 --> 01:12:53,509
How can l say no to you?

1016
01:12:54,676 --> 01:12:57,748
Thank you for being my guide
for the day.

1017
01:12:57,836 --> 01:12:59,189
lt's nothing.

1018
01:12:59,276 --> 01:13:02,746
Make a note of what l bought.
l'll pay you back soon.

1019
01:13:03,756 --> 01:13:05,394
Consider it a deposit.

1020
01:13:05,476 --> 01:13:06,625
Deposit?

1021
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,672
You promised to sell me some shares.

1022
01:13:08,756 --> 01:13:12,385
- Of course! Take these to my room.
- Yes, sir.

1023
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:15,388
Shall we sign the papers upstairs?

1024
01:13:15,476 --> 01:13:19,469
No, let's say your office tomorrow.
The shares will be ready then.

1025
01:13:19,556 --> 01:13:20,591
Fine.

1026
01:13:21,516 --> 01:13:23,586
Mr Wong, l'll accompany you
to your room.

1027
01:13:23,676 --> 01:13:25,507
- There's no need.
- l insist.

1028
01:13:25,596 --> 01:13:28,269
l'd really like a cup of coffee
right now.

1029
01:13:28,356 --> 01:13:31,234
- Let's have a coffee, then.
- Fine.

1030
01:13:36,756 --> 01:13:38,986
- No coffee?
- l'd better go back to my room.

1031
01:13:39,076 --> 01:13:40,225
Back to your room.

1032
01:13:43,396 --> 01:13:45,671
Why don't you call the station?

1033
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:49,385
- Call the station?
- ln case they're looking for you.

1034
01:13:49,476 --> 01:13:51,990
- lt's all right.
- Call to please me, then.

01:13:59,156 --> 01:14:00,987
- No, you go to your mother.
- OK.

1038
01:14:02,156 --> 01:14:04,875
- Why is he tagging along?
- He wants to.

1039
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:07,186
- Don't let him.
- l'm doing my best.

1040
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,104
Luming, let's go.

1041
01:14:14,876 --> 01:14:17,071
- What's up?
- lnspector Ho. Sort him out.

1042
01:14:20,636 --> 01:14:22,274
l'll be back soon.

1043
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:25,350
Kwong-On Bank, please.

1044
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,588
Uncle, why are you here?

1045
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:30,510
Admiring the lights.

1046
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:32,507
lnspector Ho, lnspector Ho.

1047
01:14:33,236 --> 01:14:35,113
- You?
- There's a fight outside.

1048
01:14:35,196 --> 01:14:36,993
Can't you see l'm busy?

1049
01:14:37,076 --> 01:14:38,953
But you are the inspector.

1050
01:14:39,036 --> 01:14:40,867
Don't you lecture me. Yes?

1051
01:14:42,116 --> 01:14:44,391
Kwong-On Bank? Go away!

1052
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:45,875
Sorry, not you.

1053
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,833
- They're still here. Are you busy?
- No.

1054
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,349
Then join me.

1055
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:54,151
Why is he here?

1056
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:55,555
Think of something.

1057
01:14:55,876 --> 01:14:57,832
l couldn't find you earlier.

1058
01:14:58,316 --> 01:15:01,786
l have something to say.
Where's Chen Wah?

1059
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:03,707
He's just gone to the restroom.

1060
01:15:03,836 --> 01:15:05,474
We can't leave yet. Come, come.

1061
01:15:05,556 --> 01:15:07,274
Sit down and speak slowly.

1062
01:15:07,356 --> 01:15:08,345
l've no time.

1063
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:09,949
Floating in three months!

1064
01:15:10,036 --> 01:15:13,711
They didn't sell as well
as they thought? Thank you.

1065
01:15:15,196 --> 01:15:18,268
- Excuse me.
- One moment. Yes, sir?

1066
01:15:18,356 --> 01:15:20,312
- ls Mr Wong living here?
- Yes.

1067
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:21,351
ls that...?

1068
01:15:21,436 --> 01:15:23,074
He's over there.

1069
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:30,755
- A friend of yours?
- A small business matter.

1070
01:15:30,836 --> 01:15:31,985
Hey!

1071
01:15:33,356 --> 01:15:35,995
Nothing. l'm rich!

1072
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:39,227
Finished work already?
Mr Kao has an easy life.

1073
01:15:40,156 --> 01:15:42,590
- Sit down for a chat.
- l'm still busy.

1074
01:15:45,316 --> 01:15:47,705
lnspector Ho? ls your eye better?

1075
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:49,673
- Who are you?
- l hit you in the eye.

1076
01:15:49,756 --> 01:15:52,873
- You're confessing?
- Not exactly, l want your other eye.

1077
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,625
Go, l'll chase you
to the ends of the Earth.

1078
01:15:59,276 --> 01:16:01,073
Stop, l'll get you!

1079
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:02,305
What's the matter?

1080
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:03,715
What's the matter?

1081
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:07,985
l think the gangsters are fighting.
l'll take my leave of you.

1082
01:16:08,076 --> 01:16:09,794
Have dinner with us tonight.

1083
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:11,195
We'll be there.

1084
01:16:12,996 --> 01:16:16,227
l'm not going to talk business
any more. l'll stay and have tea.

1085
01:16:16,316 --> 01:16:20,150
- Don't bring them here for tea.
- lt's difficult to control them.

1086
01:16:20,236 --> 01:16:22,909
- You'd better stay here.
- Sit down again?

1087
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,668
Take them to the room.

1088
01:16:26,396 --> 01:16:29,786
l'd prefer to stay
and have tea and stay for dinner too.

1089
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,070
All right.

1090
01:16:33,076 --> 01:16:34,828
Mr Kuo, the press.

1091
01:16:35,516 --> 01:16:37,984
- How did they get in?
- Bribery, l suppose.

1092
01:16:38,076 --> 01:16:40,067
And that's why l came to Hong Kong.

1093
01:16:40,156 --> 01:16:42,192
ls that so?
A photo, if you don't mind?

1094
01:16:42,276 --> 01:16:43,470
Fine, fine.

1095
01:16:43,556 --> 01:16:46,275
- Mr Wong.
- Chen Wah, l'm glad you're here.

1096
01:16:46,356 --> 01:16:49,507
Come, let's have a group photo.
Everybody join in.

1097
01:16:52,436 --> 01:16:54,347
- A photo, Dad?
- This way.

1098
01:16:54,436 --> 01:16:57,428
Good. Altogether. Altogether.

1099
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:00,112
Ready, set...

1100
01:17:02,196 --> 01:17:03,390
Thank you.

1101
01:17:06,276 --> 01:17:07,834
Auntie, come and sit down.

1102
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:11,514
- A moment. What paper are you with?
- The Sun.

1103
01:17:11,596 --> 01:17:13,712
- When will it be published?
- Tomorrow.

1104
01:17:21,836 --> 01:17:24,066
Get the flower, then we can go.

1105
01:17:26,116 --> 01:17:27,754
- Good luck.
- You're very busy.

1106
01:17:27,836 --> 01:17:30,828
- Do you really believe that?
- lt's not a matter of belief.

1107
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,271
Why haven't you introduced
your friend?

1108
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:35,824
Why does he hide behind you?

1109
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:39,670
He's shy. You must excuse me now.

1110
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:42,907
- Chen Wah, l want to say something.
- What is it?

1111
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:47,467
Madam Kao has consented
to a Shanghai wedding.

1112
01:17:48,876 --> 01:17:52,391
ln Shanghai! Congratulations!

1113
01:17:52,796 --> 01:17:55,549
Madam Kao, thank you
for your hospitality

1114
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:57,547
and consent to this marriage.

1115
01:17:57,636 --> 01:17:59,194
You're very kind.

1116
01:17:59,276 --> 01:18:02,109
My trip is so brief
and l've missed so many people.

1117
01:18:02,196 --> 01:18:06,508
l suggest an engagement party
with all the Hong Kong dignitaries

1118
01:18:06,596 --> 01:18:07,870
and your friends.

1119
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:09,789
What do you think?

1120
01:18:09,876 --> 01:18:13,232
- Chen Wah, what do you think?
- Me? l've no objection.

1121
01:18:13,876 --> 01:18:15,867
Then it's settled.

1122
01:18:15,956 --> 01:18:18,390
Good idea.
Kill two birds with one stone.

1123
01:18:18,476 --> 01:18:21,195
Mr Wong, please, excuse me.

1124
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:25,155
Chen Wah, for an engagement in Hong
Kong, all the VlPs must be invited.

1125
01:18:25,236 --> 01:18:26,794
All right. You take care of it.

1126
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:28,468
Did you get that?

1127
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:35,149
Western style is more grand.
Eastern style is more relaxed.

1128
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:37,750
Do your Chinese friends
outnumber foreign friends?

1129
01:18:37,836 --> 01:18:40,066
We have more Chinese
than foreign friends.

1130
01:18:41,996 --> 01:18:44,829
Cousin, cousin.

1131
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:46,474
He's calling you.

1132
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:50,310
Sorry, shall we discuss
the guest list?

1133
01:18:50,396 --> 01:18:52,227
Luming, come here.

1134
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,307
We need to talk about it.

1135
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,909
- Sorry.
- No, no, go.

1136
01:18:56,996 --> 01:18:57,951
Sit for a while.

1137
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:02,508
Madam Kao, any other ideas?

1138
01:19:03,436 --> 01:19:04,869
Lots of foreign friends?

1139
01:19:06,836 --> 01:19:12,069
How are we to get VlPs to attend?

1140
01:19:12,156 --> 01:19:15,546
Nothing is impossible to you.

1141
01:19:15,636 --> 01:19:17,388
Thanks for the confidence.

1142
01:19:17,476 --> 01:19:20,912
Mr Wong is making such a big fuss
about everything.

1143
01:19:20,996 --> 01:19:22,987
lt's all your fault.

1144
01:19:23,076 --> 01:19:24,191
Simple, you said.

1145
01:19:24,276 --> 01:19:27,871
Just get a suite, buy some
new clothes, a little make-up.

1146
01:19:27,956 --> 01:19:29,833
lt's one thing after another.

1147
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:34,751
Kidnapping reporters and businessmen.
Beating up police. This is a mess.

1148
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,952
But you just said you were happy.

1149
01:19:37,036 --> 01:19:38,105
Shut up!

1150
01:19:38,956 --> 01:19:41,470
You started all this. Fix it!

1151
01:19:41,556 --> 01:19:46,471
lt's a bit late to start blaming me.
You helped Madam Kao as well.

1152
01:19:46,556 --> 01:19:49,593
- Helping people is a good thing.
- Correct.

1153
01:19:49,676 --> 01:19:53,271
- But you must know your limits!
- You're just making it worse!

1154
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,665
You are all right.
lt's me that's wrong.

1155
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:57,826
This is not a mistake.

1156
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:01,591
lt is. l have too much sympathy,
but not enough ability.

1157
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:04,349
Trying to help Madam Kao
perform miracles.

1158
01:20:04,436 --> 01:20:08,827
You're right. l don't measure up.

1159
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:15,193
Please tell her we've done all
we can. l've no more to give.

1160
01:20:15,276 --> 01:20:16,311
At this stage?

1161
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:18,785
- When should l tell her?
- You'll ruin the marriage.

1162
01:20:18,876 --> 01:20:20,992
- lmagine we never helped her.
- That's rich.

1163
01:20:21,076 --> 01:20:23,590
Yes, l'm getting out now.

1164
01:20:23,676 --> 01:20:25,951
l won't tell her, l'm not so cruel.

1165
01:20:26,036 --> 01:20:27,310
- You...
- l won't.

1166
01:20:27,396 --> 01:20:28,385
- Tell her.
- No.

1167
01:20:28,476 --> 01:20:29,795
l'll tell her, then.

1168
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:34,185
Uncle.

1169
01:20:36,076 --> 01:20:38,874
Auntie, Dad.

1170
01:20:39,796 --> 01:20:42,549
- We're not interrupting?
- Not at all.

1171
01:20:44,436 --> 01:20:46,904
- What's the matter?
- Mum says you're very kind.

1172
01:20:47,316 --> 01:20:51,594
You are very big hearted, so...

1173
01:20:52,036 --> 01:20:55,631
So, we'd like you to be godfather
to our first baby.

1174
01:20:55,716 --> 01:20:58,071
- Godfather?
- You wouldn't refuse us?

1175
01:21:00,636 --> 01:21:02,274
We won't keep you any longer.

1176
01:21:02,596 --> 01:21:03,870
Auntie.

1177
01:21:05,316 --> 01:21:06,544
Bye-bye, Uncle.

1178
01:21:20,356 --> 01:21:22,392
Godfather, what an idea.

1179
01:21:23,076 --> 01:21:26,307
Get all the bosses
and their women to pose as VlPs.

1180
01:21:30,316 --> 01:21:32,591
Why are you staring?
ls it a bad idea?

1181
01:21:32,676 --> 01:21:35,144
lt's a good idea.
But they won't look the part.

1182
01:21:35,236 --> 01:21:36,225
Dress them up.

1183
01:21:36,316 --> 01:21:38,784
- l'll teach them etiquette.
- l'll do make-up.

1184
01:21:38,876 --> 01:21:41,595
- Go to work. l'll make some calls.
- Let's go.

1185
01:21:41,676 --> 01:21:43,155
Do you know what you're doing?

1186
01:21:44,796 --> 01:21:46,991
- What's up?
- He tried to run away.

1187
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:48,111
Run away?

1188
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:52,030
l can't cope. l just want to go home.

1189
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:57,866
- How are you going to get there?
- By boat or train.

1190
01:21:57,956 --> 01:21:59,674
What about in a wheelchair?

1191
01:22:03,036 --> 01:22:06,312
l'm not going. l have work to do.

1192
01:22:07,676 --> 01:22:08,995
Let's go.

1193
01:22:09,436 --> 01:22:11,347
Everyone's assignment
is written here.

1194
01:22:11,436 --> 01:22:14,314
This is yours, remember it.
This is yours.

1195
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,465
Take it easy.

1196
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:19,629
l might be pregnant
and have to have an abortion.

1197
01:22:19,716 --> 01:22:23,072
You don't even know
who the father is. Stop fidgeting.

1198
01:22:23,156 --> 01:22:26,831
Please, you're ladies now.
You must be civil to each other.

1199
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:29,066
She's always bad mouthing others.

1200
01:22:29,156 --> 01:22:31,545
She already has a gut,
and she's still eating.

1201
01:22:31,636 --> 01:22:33,752
Breathe in.

1202
01:22:33,836 --> 01:22:35,269
What are you looking at?

1203
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:38,510
Straighten up. Remember your lines.

1204
01:22:41,476 --> 01:22:44,468
People! People!

1205
01:22:46,276 --> 01:22:49,712
Tong gave each of you
a piece of paper with your part.

1206
01:22:49,796 --> 01:22:51,707
Your name and what to say.

1207
01:22:51,796 --> 01:22:57,985
Remember your lines. Speak Mandarin.
Mr Wong is from Shanghai.

1208
01:23:00,396 --> 01:23:02,830
Don't start yet.

1209
01:23:03,996 --> 01:23:08,706
Just remember your part
and act like ladies and gentlemen.

1210
01:23:08,796 --> 01:23:11,549
Why should we?
He might be more vulgar than l am.

1211
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:13,149
Who are you?

1212
01:23:13,236 --> 01:23:14,715
The Secretary of Education.

1213
01:23:14,796 --> 01:23:17,390
Education?
How could he be more vulgar than you?

1214
01:23:17,476 --> 01:23:19,990
- Why?
- That's why.

1215
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:24,704
Your face doesn't fit the part.
Who's the Chief Warden?

1216
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:28,106
Who's got that paper?

1217
01:23:28,196 --> 01:23:31,632
You're the Chief Warden.
Why didn't you reply?

1218
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:33,866
l don't know. l can't read.

1219
01:23:33,956 --> 01:23:35,708
Can't read?! What do you mean?

1220
01:23:35,796 --> 01:23:39,675
All right, you be the warden
and you be the secretary.

1221
01:23:42,276 --> 01:23:44,870
- You must be crazy!
- What's the matter?

1222
01:23:44,956 --> 01:23:46,514
He felt me up.

1223
01:23:46,596 --> 01:23:48,905
Help me out here, be civilised.

1224
01:23:48,996 --> 01:23:50,111
lt was all a mistake.

1225
01:23:51,076 --> 01:23:54,989
- Bastard, molesting my bird!
- You dare to hit me?

1226
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:57,589
Don't fight!

1227
01:23:57,676 --> 01:23:59,348
Let me go!

1228
01:23:59,436 --> 01:24:00,551
Stop it!

1229
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,033
Stop acting like this!

1230
01:24:06,556 --> 01:24:08,035
Stop fighting!

1231
01:24:09,076 --> 01:24:11,385
Listen to me! Stop fighting!

1232
01:24:18,356 --> 01:24:20,995
Listen to me.

1233
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:25,112
Aren't you tired
of all this fighting and killing?

1234
01:24:25,196 --> 01:24:28,984
This may be your only chance
in life to do a good deed.

1235
01:24:31,076 --> 01:24:34,751
You might not understand
why you have to help Madam Kao.

1236
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:38,749
Just think - when you're old
and your children ask,

1237
01:24:38,836 --> 01:24:42,431
''Dad, what are your proudest
achievements in your life?''

1238
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:44,313
What should you say?

1239
01:24:44,396 --> 01:24:46,546
Do you tell them you were a gangster,

1240
01:24:46,636 --> 01:24:49,946
opening brothels, casinos,
racketeering...

1241
01:24:50,036 --> 01:24:51,435
Does this make you proud?

1242
01:24:52,636 --> 01:24:56,549
This may be the only thing
you can tell them.

1243
01:24:57,956 --> 01:25:01,232
- Do you understand?
- No!

1244
01:25:02,276 --> 01:25:03,595
Tong, Tong!

1245
01:25:03,676 --> 01:25:05,348
l'm here!

1246
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:08,191
l told you they weren't
to carry guns.

1247
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:09,311
l did tell them.

1248
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:12,115
Ask who else is carrying a gun!

1249
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:14,187
Who's still got a gun?

1250
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,391
Me!

1251
01:25:17,716 --> 01:25:21,072
Take all their guns away!

1252
01:25:21,156 --> 01:25:23,147
l told you not to and you still did.

1253
01:25:26,556 --> 01:25:27,750
''The Ritz''

1254
01:25:41,956 --> 01:25:44,709
Here's $5,000 from the Ho's
and $5,000 from me.

1255
01:25:44,796 --> 01:25:46,548
That's not too greedy, is it?

1256
01:25:46,636 --> 01:25:50,754
That's not greedy.
l'll give you the shares.

1257
01:25:50,836 --> 01:25:52,633
- Do you need to count it?
- No need.

1258
01:25:52,716 --> 01:25:55,549
Thank you.
When did the two reporters leave?

1259
01:25:55,636 --> 01:25:58,230
l went back to work.
l don't know when they left.

1260
01:25:58,316 --> 01:25:59,271
Sign here.

1261
01:25:59,356 --> 01:26:01,950
Mr Wong. Will there be anything else?

1262
01:26:02,036 --> 01:26:05,073
l'm going to a party tonight.

1263
01:26:05,156 --> 01:26:08,387
- Who's that?
- Mr Wong, the Shanghai magnate.

1264
01:26:08,476 --> 01:26:10,148
He's the multi-millionaire, Mr Wong?

1265
01:26:12,316 --> 01:26:13,385
Thank you.

1266
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:17,992
Thank you, Mr Wong.
Thanks for looking out for me.

1267
01:26:18,076 --> 01:26:20,510
No need. You've been most attentive.

1268
01:26:20,596 --> 01:26:22,985
lf we don't look out for each other,
who will?

1269
01:26:23,076 --> 01:26:24,907
How much did we spend last time?

1270
01:26:24,996 --> 01:26:27,112
- Don't worry about it.
- l insist!

1271
01:26:28,076 --> 01:26:30,351
Here's $2,000 for your trouble.

1272
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:32,108
- So much money?
- Keep it.

1273
01:26:32,996 --> 01:26:36,591
lt's chicken feed to me,
but it's a quite a bundle to you.

1274
01:26:37,876 --> 01:26:41,994
Remember, once the shares hit
two dollars, sell them.

1275
01:26:42,076 --> 01:26:43,794
- Double?
- Don't be too greedy.

1276
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:46,109
l'll be rich.

1277
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:49,670
l can't believe this bunch of paper
is so valuable.

1278
01:26:49,756 --> 01:26:51,633
lt's only paper.

1279
01:26:51,716 --> 01:26:54,355
Remember, these shares
are in high demand.

1280
01:26:54,436 --> 01:26:56,586
Don't tell anyone l gave them to you.

1281
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:59,907
Remember, once they've doubled,
sell immediately.

1282
01:27:00,276 --> 01:27:01,868
l'm leaving now.

1283
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:03,904
30,000 shares?

1284
01:27:05,316 --> 01:27:07,591
Mr Wong. Mr Wong, sir.

1285
01:27:08,596 --> 01:27:12,032
What about the police club?

1286
01:27:12,116 --> 01:27:14,755
Oh, that?

1287
01:27:16,556 --> 01:27:18,865
lt's a good thing
l have one cheque left.

1288
01:27:18,956 --> 01:27:22,232
Thanks very much, sir.
Spending more money.

1289
01:27:23,836 --> 01:27:25,155
There.

1290
01:27:25,236 --> 01:27:26,385
$80,000?

1291
01:27:26,476 --> 01:27:28,034
That's too much!

1292
01:27:28,116 --> 01:27:31,745
- lt's only $65,000.
- That was my last cheque.

1293
01:27:31,836 --> 01:27:34,396
The next time l'm in town,
l'll write you another.

1294
01:27:34,476 --> 01:27:35,795
l'll rip this one up.

1295
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:38,026
No need, l'll give you the change.

1296
01:27:38,116 --> 01:27:41,825
Change?
Where are you going to get $15,000?

1297
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,269
l have it.

1298
01:27:43,356 --> 01:27:44,755
Can you keep a secret?

1299
01:27:44,836 --> 01:27:47,066
l've got some evidence money.

1300
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:50,664
l'll get it for you.

1301
01:27:56,996 --> 01:27:59,066
Mr Wong, there's $13,000.

1302
01:27:59,836 --> 01:28:01,906
Add my $2,000, that makes $15,000.

1303
01:28:01,996 --> 01:28:03,509
Nephew, you are so clever.

1304
01:28:04,516 --> 01:28:09,874
Thank you on behalf of the Ho's,
the police and myself.

1305
01:28:09,956 --> 01:28:11,708
Thank you, thank you.

1306
01:28:11,796 --> 01:28:15,345
Such small things,
unworthy of mention.

1307
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:18,144
Let go.

1308
01:28:18,716 --> 01:28:20,069
Till we meet again.

1309
01:28:21,556 --> 01:28:23,069
Mr Wong, let me see you out.

1310
01:28:23,676 --> 01:28:26,474
There's no need.
Look after your shares.

1311
01:28:26,556 --> 01:28:28,114
Don't let anybody see them.

1312
01:28:28,996 --> 01:28:30,395
Remember, double.

1313
01:28:30,476 --> 01:28:31,431
Double.

1314
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:41,790
Lucky me.

1315
01:28:53,556 --> 01:28:54,511
Hey, you, stop!

1316
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,309
Me? What's the matter?

1317
01:28:58,156 --> 01:29:01,512
Don't move.
Watch him and don't let him go.

1318
01:29:01,596 --> 01:29:03,666
l'm a friend of lnspector Ho.

1319
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:06,224
Some friend! Great! Watch him.

1320
01:29:07,036 --> 01:29:08,025
So that's that.

1321
01:29:08,116 --> 01:29:09,151
Chief lnspector Ho.

1322
01:29:10,876 --> 01:29:12,389
What have you been doing?

1323
01:29:12,476 --> 01:29:16,025
There are so many missing persons
and you haven't found any!

1324
01:29:16,116 --> 01:29:17,390
We've got some leads.

1325
01:29:17,476 --> 01:29:22,027
The gang who's doing the kidnapping
is different from the extortion gang.

1326
01:29:22,676 --> 01:29:24,667
- What's the difference?
- Well...

1327
01:29:24,756 --> 01:29:26,314
Commandant.

1328
01:29:26,396 --> 01:29:27,590
Chief lnspector.

1329
01:29:27,676 --> 01:29:30,144
- Why didn't you knock?
- lt's very urgent.

1330
01:29:30,236 --> 01:29:34,309
This discussion is very urgent.
We haven't received any ransom notes.

1331
01:29:34,396 --> 01:29:37,149
Fool! Even HQ has heard about this.

1332
01:29:37,236 --> 01:29:42,549
Find all the missing persons in three
days or one of us gets fired. See?

1333
01:29:44,636 --> 01:29:46,627
Get the car ready!

1334
01:29:48,796 --> 01:29:50,548
- Damn him!
- Chief lnspector!

1335
01:29:50,836 --> 01:29:52,667
Did you send men to the Ritz?

1336
01:29:52,756 --> 01:29:54,348
l did so, sir!

1337
01:29:55,716 --> 01:29:58,674
- Remember, you are responsible.
- Understood, sir.

1338
01:29:58,756 --> 01:29:59,711
ldiot!

1339
01:30:02,476 --> 01:30:03,829
lt's me.

1340
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:06,794
- You come in without knocking again?
- lt's very urgent.

1341
01:30:06,876 --> 01:30:09,390
Urgent? Where have you been all day?

1342
01:30:09,476 --> 01:30:12,354
- l went to King's Hotel.
- l didn't tell you to go there.

1343
01:30:12,436 --> 01:30:14,711
But l found something out
about Mr Wong.

1344
01:30:14,796 --> 01:30:18,584
l tell you do one thing, you do
another. You disobey my orders.

1345
01:30:18,676 --> 01:30:21,907
- Hear me out first.
- You don't respect my authority.

1346
01:30:21,996 --> 01:30:22,951
But...

1347
01:30:23,036 --> 01:30:26,426
Why did you disobey my orders?
Don't you know my boss is after me?

1348
01:30:26,516 --> 01:30:28,984
- l know...
- Then why don't you go after them?

1349
01:30:29,076 --> 01:30:32,193
l am about to be fired -
and the rest of you, too.

1350
01:30:32,276 --> 01:30:34,312
Nobody is looking out for me.

1351
01:30:35,636 --> 01:30:36,955
Why are you here?

1352
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:38,988
Obstructing justice.

1353
01:30:39,076 --> 01:30:40,873
That's a capital offence!

1354
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:43,866
- ls that true?
- He's crazy.

1355
01:30:43,956 --> 01:30:45,947
Any leads on the missing persons?

1356
01:30:46,036 --> 01:30:48,550
- No, but we found Mr Wong...
- Nothing?

1357
01:30:48,636 --> 01:30:51,867
After all this time?

1358
01:30:52,116 --> 01:30:55,745
ldiot! And your mother
asked me to promote you!

1359
01:30:55,836 --> 01:31:00,864
Promote you to the heavens. What's
this about Mr Wong, then? Speak!

1360
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:03,993
l found out he's not
one of Shanghai's ten richest men.

1361
01:31:04,076 --> 01:31:08,752
He isn't. l suppose you are.
Do you look the part?

1362
01:31:08,836 --> 01:31:12,272
Just say who he is. Go on! Go on!

1363
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:14,632
'Bastard!'

1364
01:31:14,716 --> 01:31:17,674
Not only is he
one of Shanghai's richest men,

1365
01:31:17,756 --> 01:31:20,793
but he's one of the richest men
in all China!

1366
01:31:21,276 --> 01:31:25,349
Well done, well done,
that's very good indeed.

1367
01:31:25,436 --> 01:31:27,711
l don't need you to tell me that!
Get out!

1368
01:31:29,196 --> 01:31:30,675
'l must get away.'

1369
01:31:31,116 --> 01:31:32,435
Chief lnspector.

1370
01:31:32,516 --> 01:31:35,189
- You still didn't knock?
- Can l take some holiday?

1371
01:31:35,276 --> 01:31:37,551
- Holiday?
- Mother is sick.

1372
01:31:37,636 --> 01:31:39,069
- ls you father sick, too?
- No.

1373
01:31:39,156 --> 01:31:41,716
Get out! Don't ever come back!

1374
01:31:45,396 --> 01:31:48,991
- You look down. Was it that bad?
- l'm going on holiday.

1375
01:31:49,076 --> 01:31:52,034
Be smart, like me.
l've got some new leads.

1376
01:31:52,876 --> 01:31:55,390
Work hard and you'll get there.

1377
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,831
Mr Wong, you're still here?

1378
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:04,391
- l'll just see him off.
- Take Mr Wong back to the hotel.

1379
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:08,071
l will, l will. l'll take him
wherever he wants to go.

1380
01:32:08,156 --> 01:32:11,592
Bye-bye, Mr Wong. Walk carefully.

1381
01:32:12,476 --> 01:32:13,955
Where are you taking me?

1382
01:32:14,036 --> 01:32:16,869
l know where l'm going.
l don't know about you.

1383
01:32:18,916 --> 01:32:20,713
Chief lnspector!

1384
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:26,794
- Why does nobody knock any more?
- Sorry Chief.

1385
01:32:26,876 --> 01:32:30,346
l saw Kuo's men with guns
at the Ritz. Something's up.

1386
01:32:30,436 --> 01:32:31,710
Who are they?

1387
01:32:32,516 --> 01:32:36,907
Thieves, criminals,
all those on our wanted list.

1388
01:32:37,796 --> 01:32:40,151
Then why did you leave?

1389
01:32:40,236 --> 01:32:42,909
Get some men over there
and arrest them!

1390
01:32:43,396 --> 01:32:44,988
l'll get the warrant.

1391
01:32:46,396 --> 01:32:49,786
Why are you standing there?
Give me my hat.

1392
01:32:53,196 --> 01:32:55,756
What are you all staring at?
Follow us.

1393
01:32:56,876 --> 01:32:58,275
And that's the truth?

1394
01:32:58,356 --> 01:33:02,269
Yes. Apparently,
their people are at the Ritz.

1395
01:33:02,356 --> 01:33:04,153
What about the two boys we sent?

1396
01:33:04,236 --> 01:33:05,555
No news whatsoever.

1397
01:33:05,636 --> 01:33:09,470
lt backs up what l said.
Kuo did take two of your men.

1398
01:33:09,556 --> 01:33:11,148
Why are you doing this?

1399
01:33:11,996 --> 01:33:14,226
l just want the killings to stop.

1400
01:33:15,996 --> 01:33:18,908
One, two, three, bow.

1401
01:33:18,996 --> 01:33:20,588
That was great.

1402
01:33:20,676 --> 01:33:23,509
This is a dress rehearsal.
Luming will be Wong.

1403
01:33:24,476 --> 01:33:26,546
Make an effort.

1404
01:33:27,196 --> 01:33:29,630
l'm Mr Wong. And you are?

1405
01:33:29,716 --> 01:33:33,834
l'm Miss Foxy,
the Rotary Chair person.

1406
01:33:36,836 --> 01:33:41,352
You're Miss Fox, the Rotary Chair
person. What is this Foxy?

1407
01:33:41,436 --> 01:33:42,710
That was my Mandarin.

1408
01:33:42,796 --> 01:33:44,070
Stick to Cantonese.

1409
01:33:45,836 --> 01:33:49,431
- l'm Mr Wong, and you are?
- l'm the Governor of Hong Kong.

1410
01:33:51,436 --> 01:33:55,509
You're not the Governor, you're
the Minister for Transportation.

1411
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:57,234
l want to be Governor.

1412
01:33:57,316 --> 01:33:58,908
Why?

1413
01:33:58,996 --> 01:34:03,035
lf he's Police Commissioner,
l've got to be Governor.

1414
01:34:03,116 --> 01:34:04,754
l must be Governor.

1415
01:34:04,836 --> 01:34:06,588
Don't take it so seriously.

1416
01:34:06,676 --> 01:34:09,668
l must outrank him. l'm the Governor.

1417
01:34:11,716 --> 01:34:13,229
He insists on being Governor.

1418
01:34:13,316 --> 01:34:15,147
Fine! Let him be Governor, then.

1419
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:22,192
- Run through it again.
- One more time. Please, cooperate.

1420
01:34:22,276 --> 01:34:24,392
Boss, Mrs Shun wants to see you.

1421
01:34:25,356 --> 01:34:28,234
Once again. One, two, three and bow.

1422
01:34:29,036 --> 01:34:32,267
Boss, the police
have surrounded the place.

1423
01:34:32,356 --> 01:34:33,914
- Right outside?
- Yes.

1424
01:34:44,276 --> 01:34:45,470
What is it?

1425
01:34:46,996 --> 01:34:50,511
- The police have us surrounded.
- Police? How come?

1426
01:34:50,596 --> 01:34:54,828
They're waiting for lnspector Ho
to come with a warrant.

1427
01:34:54,916 --> 01:34:57,510
He must think
we're starting a gang war.

1428
01:34:57,596 --> 01:35:00,906
We can't leave and Madam Kao
is waiting. lt's nearly time.

1429
01:35:00,996 --> 01:35:03,146
Oh, dear,
we'll be found out for sure.

1430
01:35:03,236 --> 01:35:04,635
This is bad.

1431
01:35:04,716 --> 01:35:06,115
The poor woman.

1432
01:35:06,196 --> 01:35:08,152
- What shall we do?
- Search me.

1433
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:11,034
- What shall we do?
- He's the boss.

1434
01:35:11,116 --> 01:35:13,072
Come on, think!

1435
01:35:13,156 --> 01:35:14,225
What shall we do?

1436
01:35:14,316 --> 01:35:16,989
l'll go to the courthouse
to get lnspector Ho.

1437
01:35:17,076 --> 01:35:19,465
- You can't go out. What can you do?
- l don't know.

1438
01:35:19,556 --> 01:35:21,114
We'll have to play it by ear.

1439
01:35:21,596 --> 01:35:23,075
l'll go out the back way.

1440
01:35:33,556 --> 01:35:35,308
- What are you doing?
- The drinks.

1441
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,751
Forget that. Go up and practise.

1442
01:35:38,556 --> 01:35:42,469
Tell Uncle l'm going to court.
l'll contact him when l meet Ho.

1443
01:35:42,556 --> 01:35:44,069
Tell him to wait for me.

1444
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:49,429
Move on.

1445
01:35:57,036 --> 01:35:58,754
What are you doing there?

1446
01:36:02,796 --> 01:36:05,310
- What should we do?
- Ring Fei.

1447
01:36:07,956 --> 01:36:09,628
Push harder.

1448
01:36:11,156 --> 01:36:13,272
The boys must be looking for me.
Thanks.

1449
01:36:13,956 --> 01:36:16,516
He's gone to the courthouse
to get Ho.

1450
01:36:17,596 --> 01:36:20,747
- All set?
- Yeah, we know what to do.

1451
01:36:24,036 --> 01:36:26,425
What's that?

1452
01:36:27,516 --> 01:36:31,748
They found the bodies of your men.
Kuo had them killed.

1453
01:36:32,676 --> 01:36:36,954
He killed my men?
Where is he? What's he up to?

1454
01:36:37,036 --> 01:36:39,186
He's gone to get lnspector Ho.

1455
01:36:40,236 --> 01:36:41,351
For what purpose?

1456
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:44,712
Maybe he's working with the police.

1457
01:36:45,596 --> 01:36:48,474
Damn it! Let's go!

1458
01:36:57,276 --> 01:37:00,791
l've got to leave now.
l'll look your boss up after this.

1459
01:37:06,396 --> 01:37:09,069
- What now?
- l'm hungry.

1460
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:10,874
- Me, too.
- Let's go.

1461
01:37:11,756 --> 01:37:13,553
l can't find him anywhere.

1462
01:37:18,516 --> 01:37:21,713
There he is. Let's go!

1463
01:37:51,836 --> 01:37:54,589
- My leg!
- My hand!

1464
01:38:04,316 --> 01:38:06,466
- You broke my pots! Pay up...
- Damn you!

1465
01:38:12,596 --> 01:38:13,745
Hold it! Don't run!

1466
01:40:01,636 --> 01:40:03,467
We've got you now.

1467
01:40:04,396 --> 01:40:06,591
Get ready.
The guests will be here soon.

1468
01:40:06,676 --> 01:40:08,746
Make sure there are enough drinks.

1469
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:11,828
l'll see to it. Relax.

1470
01:40:13,316 --> 01:40:14,510
Problems?

1471
01:40:14,596 --> 01:40:19,033
No, they're rehearsing the entrance.
There's plenty of time. Don't worry.

1472
01:40:25,236 --> 01:40:27,750
- Where is he?
- Up there.

1473
01:40:34,516 --> 01:40:36,632
- Get him down.
- Bring him down.

1474
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:40,669
Tiger, sorry
for not having tea with you.

1475
01:40:45,956 --> 01:40:47,912
Damn it! l liked you.

1476
01:40:49,516 --> 01:40:53,191
l promise to have tea with you,
but you've got to let me go now.

1477
01:40:53,276 --> 01:40:54,345
lt's very urgent.

1478
01:40:54,436 --> 01:40:59,829
Let you go? l sent two boys
to invite you to tea.

1479
01:40:59,916 --> 01:41:05,388
- You killed them. Why?
- l didn't. l set them free.

1480
01:41:07,396 --> 01:41:08,749
Where's my gun?

1481
01:41:08,836 --> 01:41:14,149
Didn't you hear what l said? l didn't
kill them. They'll be back soon.

1482
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:18,829
Brother Fei, tell him
l didn't kill them.

1483
01:41:18,916 --> 01:41:21,714
But you did.
The bodies have been found.

1484
01:41:21,796 --> 01:41:23,548
That's impossible.

1485
01:41:24,556 --> 01:41:28,231
Tiger, don't believe him. He's evil.
He's making fools of us both.

1486
01:41:28,316 --> 01:41:32,434
He never liked me anyway.
They'll be back soon, believe me.

1487
01:41:32,516 --> 01:41:34,313
Where are they, then?

1488
01:41:35,076 --> 01:41:39,752
- They must be on their way back.
- To avenge their deaths?

1489
01:41:39,836 --> 01:41:41,554
Damn it, don't string me along!

1490
01:41:41,636 --> 01:41:44,594
Tiger, believe me.
l didn't kill them!

1491
01:41:44,676 --> 01:41:46,189
Tiger! Tiger!

1492
01:41:46,956 --> 01:41:50,631
Can you kill me later? l've got
urgent business to attend to.

1493
01:41:50,716 --> 01:41:52,832
Shut up! l'll kill you now.

1494
01:41:52,916 --> 01:41:54,395
Here they are.

1495
01:41:59,916 --> 01:42:02,066
l told you l didn't kill them.

1496
01:42:02,156 --> 01:42:04,954
- Why aren't you two dead already?
- Not yet. He saved us.

1497
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,675
- He set us free.
- Damn it, you scared me.

1498
01:42:07,756 --> 01:42:10,316
Tiger, l told you
l didn't lie to you.

1499
01:42:11,636 --> 01:42:14,230
So, you creep,
you want to be the boss?

1500
01:42:14,316 --> 01:42:18,628
Tiger, l did it for you.
l would make a much better boss.

1501
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:21,788
There's no way you could be better!
Release him!

1502
01:42:21,876 --> 01:42:23,229
Take it easy!

1503
01:42:23,316 --> 01:42:27,628
Tiger, l hope you understand.
l did this for your own good.

1504
01:42:27,716 --> 01:42:32,073
From now on,
keep out of our family affairs.

1505
01:42:32,156 --> 01:42:37,230
Your family affairs! No problem.
l got him. Stop him if you can.

1506
01:42:40,556 --> 01:42:43,548
Tiger, l will certainly
have tea with you.

1507
01:42:44,756 --> 01:42:47,748
Brother Fei, as you pointed out,
this is a family affair.

1508
01:42:47,836 --> 01:42:49,110
Let's go and sort it out.

1509
01:42:49,196 --> 01:42:51,266
l've got urgent business, excuse me.

1510
01:42:53,716 --> 01:42:56,514
Don't think
you're going to leave here alive.

1511
01:43:00,116 --> 01:43:01,549
Tiger.

1512
01:43:01,636 --> 01:43:05,834
l won't interfere, but rules are
rules. l'll keep the guns for you.

1513
01:43:09,556 --> 01:43:14,710
Canton kid, have no fear.
l'll make sure there's no foul play.

1514
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,392
But l might be dead by then.

1515
01:43:21,356 --> 01:43:23,347
Get him and the factory is yours.

1516
01:43:24,476 --> 01:43:25,704
Get him!

1517
01:43:30,036 --> 01:43:30,991
Out of the way!

1518
01:43:41,476 --> 01:43:43,228
Brother, you're good.

1519
01:43:43,316 --> 01:43:46,228
Stop. l've got to go.
Can we finish this later?

1520
01:43:46,316 --> 01:43:47,465
Grab him.

1521
01:46:12,396 --> 01:46:13,590
He's over there!

1522
01:46:51,756 --> 01:46:52,950
Pull the rope.

1523
01:47:10,676 --> 01:47:12,029
Thank you, Buddha!

1524
01:47:41,716 --> 01:47:42,944
Don'tjump!

1525
01:47:47,356 --> 01:47:48,505
l told you not to.

1526
01:48:00,036 --> 01:48:01,674
Stop fighting!

1527
01:49:07,636 --> 01:49:10,594
Don't go away. lt's your turn now.

1528
01:49:18,316 --> 01:49:19,715
You were great.

1529
01:49:21,276 --> 01:49:22,391
Brother Chen Wah.

1530
01:49:22,476 --> 01:49:26,230
You've done one thing right,
the factory hands are behind you.

1531
01:49:26,316 --> 01:49:29,433
You can have the factory
and we can be family again.

1532
01:49:30,236 --> 01:49:33,353
- Thank you, Chen Wah.
- l've got to go now.

1533
01:49:33,436 --> 01:49:36,269
Canton kid, l really admire you.

1534
01:49:36,356 --> 01:49:40,269
Your family affair is settled.
We've done our bit. Let's be friends.

1535
01:49:40,356 --> 01:49:41,835
l don't have time.

1536
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:47,548
Still thinking of the beating
l gave you? Hit me back, then.

1537
01:49:49,316 --> 01:49:50,988
Go on, don't be afraid.

1538
01:49:54,156 --> 01:49:56,033
- Stand back!
- Don't move!

1539
01:49:56,116 --> 01:49:58,346
Great fistwork.

1540
01:49:58,436 --> 01:50:04,033
Canton kid, you fight really well.
Now, go on, slap me.

1541
01:50:16,316 --> 01:50:18,352
Good friends we shall be.

1542
01:50:18,436 --> 01:50:20,950
Friend, l've got to go now,
urgent business.

1543
01:50:21,036 --> 01:50:23,994
lf anything happens, count me in.

1544
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:25,270
Count your ass.

1545
01:50:25,356 --> 01:50:26,914
What's the hurry?

1546
01:50:26,996 --> 01:50:28,554
Shandong man, lend me your car.

1547
01:50:28,636 --> 01:50:31,833
- What?
- l'm borrowing your car.

1548
01:50:34,676 --> 01:50:37,031
- How was that?
- Perfect, just right.

1549
01:50:39,756 --> 01:50:41,712
Chief lnspector, you're wanted.

1550
01:50:42,556 --> 01:50:44,114
lnspector Ho.

1551
01:50:44,676 --> 01:50:46,587
Go out and keep watch.

1552
01:50:46,676 --> 01:50:49,395
lnspector, take your men away.
lnspector, please...

1553
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:50,795
How did you get out?

1554
01:50:50,876 --> 01:50:52,309
- lnspector...
- Stand up!

1555
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:56,355
lnspector Ho, please, remove them.
We're doing a good thing at the Ritz.

1556
01:50:56,436 --> 01:50:58,472
Putting you lot away
is the good thing.

1557
01:50:59,876 --> 01:51:04,188
What are you doing here?
l told you to find the missing men.

1558
01:51:04,276 --> 01:51:05,550
Sir...

1559
01:51:05,636 --> 01:51:08,196
The Attorney General
just chewed my ass!

1560
01:51:08,276 --> 01:51:11,791
From now on, your only job
is to find the missing persons

1561
01:51:11,876 --> 01:51:13,355
or you'll go missing!

1562
01:51:13,996 --> 01:51:17,193
l know the whereabouts
of the missing persons.

1563
01:51:19,036 --> 01:51:20,708
- Who's this?
- The owner of the Ritz.

1564
01:51:20,796 --> 01:51:21,751
ls that true?

1565
01:51:21,836 --> 01:51:24,031
Four reporters, two businessmen,
right?

1566
01:51:24,116 --> 01:51:26,710
Yes, this is why l brought him
to see you.

1567
01:51:26,796 --> 01:51:27,945
Follow me.

1568
01:51:28,756 --> 01:51:29,905
You too.

1569
01:51:34,036 --> 01:51:37,915
The missing persons' case is most
urgent, we must deal with it first.

1570
01:51:39,196 --> 01:51:40,948
Order them to search the Ritz.

1571
01:51:41,036 --> 01:51:44,153
No, they're getting ready
for Madam Kao's party.

1572
01:51:44,236 --> 01:51:45,385
lt's an order.

1573
01:51:45,476 --> 01:51:47,432
The missing are not in the Ritz.

1574
01:51:47,516 --> 01:51:48,744
Where are they?

1575
01:51:48,836 --> 01:51:52,829
Free my friends and l'll tell you.
First let me make a call.

1576
01:51:52,916 --> 01:51:56,147
- l can't...
- lf l don't, they won't free them.

1577
01:51:56,236 --> 01:51:57,908
Things could get ugly.

1578
01:51:57,996 --> 01:52:00,385
- All right, make your call.
- Thank you.

1579
01:52:06,156 --> 01:52:07,305
- Hello?
- Luming.

1580
01:52:07,396 --> 01:52:10,229
- Tell Uncle to release them.
- The reporters?

1581
01:52:10,316 --> 01:52:14,594
Tell Madam Kao we can't come.
Tell the brothers it's all off.

1582
01:52:17,956 --> 01:52:19,867
What now? What now?

1583
01:52:21,116 --> 01:52:23,710
One more time. Make it better.

1584
01:52:25,156 --> 01:52:28,193
There's no need.
Everything's cancelled.

1585
01:52:31,716 --> 01:52:34,594
- Why did you kidnap them?
- To keep the secret.

1586
01:52:34,676 --> 01:52:37,395
- The secret of your crimes?
- Hold your tongue!

1587
01:52:37,476 --> 01:52:39,865
- What secret?
- A lady's secret.

1588
01:52:39,956 --> 01:52:41,674
What has she to do with you?

1589
01:52:41,756 --> 01:52:45,066
Nothing, really. l just
buy a rose from her every day.

1590
01:52:46,476 --> 01:52:48,944
l know nobody will believe me.

1591
01:52:49,036 --> 01:52:52,585
We believe you, but we don't
understand the kidnapping.

1592
01:52:52,676 --> 01:52:55,713
That's exactly why.
You won't understand.

1593
01:52:55,796 --> 01:52:59,550
You see, her daughter has a rich
boyfriend, they've just graduated.

1594
01:52:59,636 --> 01:53:01,115
They're getting married here.

1595
01:53:01,196 --> 01:53:03,915
This scared the mother,
so she lied about her background.

1596
01:53:03,996 --> 01:53:07,432
She's got a heart of gold
and would never lie.

1597
01:53:07,516 --> 01:53:10,986
When l arrived in Hong Kong,
she told me to be careful.

1598
01:53:11,076 --> 01:53:15,672
A conman had already taken my last
cent. l bought a rose for luck.

1599
01:53:15,756 --> 01:53:21,831
You ladies will understand the love
between a mother and her daughter.

1600
01:53:21,916 --> 01:53:24,271
So l kidnapped the men,
but they're OK.

1601
01:53:24,356 --> 01:53:28,235
l just wanted to help
keep her secret.

1602
01:53:31,916 --> 01:53:34,271
- You don't understand, do you?
- Not a word.

1603
01:53:34,356 --> 01:53:36,995
We don't know what you're saying.

1604
01:53:37,356 --> 01:53:40,029
All right, l'll speak more slowly.

1605
01:53:40,276 --> 01:53:44,633
There once was a young flower girl.
No, an old flower lady.

1606
01:53:44,716 --> 01:53:46,388
She has a daughter, and...

1607
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:52,672
Dad, the guest...

1608
01:53:55,876 --> 01:53:58,344
Sorry, l'll see to Madam Kao.

1609
01:53:59,516 --> 01:54:02,588
Why aren't the guests here yet?

1610
01:54:04,116 --> 01:54:08,553
The car behind us broke down
and caused an almighty traffic jam.

1611
01:54:08,636 --> 01:54:10,866
That's why. They're on their way.

1612
01:54:15,676 --> 01:54:19,874
Sorry, we did our best.

1613
01:54:26,196 --> 01:54:28,152
l know what l must do.

1614
01:54:29,596 --> 01:54:31,587
How do we get out of this mess?

1615
01:54:31,676 --> 01:54:33,428
Did you say something?

1616
01:54:37,716 --> 01:54:41,994
Mr and Mrs Kao,
what's this all about?

1617
01:54:42,636 --> 01:54:43,751
l think...

1618
01:54:44,236 --> 01:54:45,669
by now...

1619
01:54:47,116 --> 01:54:49,630
you must have realised
something was wrong.

1620
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:50,990
Mum, what's happened?

1621
01:54:51,156 --> 01:54:52,874
Everything has a solution.

1622
01:54:54,516 --> 01:54:57,553
l know you came to Hong Kong
to look into Belle's background.

1623
01:54:57,636 --> 01:55:01,185
You have good reasons for doing so.

1624
01:55:02,596 --> 01:55:06,555
Guests or no guests,
we can still have a good time.

1625
01:55:06,636 --> 01:55:08,592
Let's go out for some food.

1626
01:55:09,796 --> 01:55:11,593
- Come on.
- Let me finish.

1627
01:55:13,476 --> 01:55:14,591
Mr Wong.

1628
01:55:16,276 --> 01:55:18,028
l hope you appreciate the fact...

1629
01:55:20,796 --> 01:55:23,071
that Belle is extremely
important to me.

1630
01:55:23,276 --> 01:55:25,232
To make things easier for her...

1631
01:55:27,316 --> 01:55:29,830
l've done things
l never dreamed of doing.

1632
01:55:30,716 --> 01:55:33,992
Mum, don't be like that.

1633
01:55:34,076 --> 01:55:36,874
Tell us everything.
We'll sort it out.

1634
01:55:40,196 --> 01:55:41,470
l understand now.

1635
01:55:42,796 --> 01:55:45,185
Whatever you do...

1636
01:55:45,756 --> 01:55:48,953
you get what you deserve
in this life.

1637
01:55:49,036 --> 01:55:51,869
Madam, if it's about the guests,
sorry for the trouble.

1638
01:55:51,956 --> 01:55:54,914
l didn't realise it would upset you.

1639
01:55:54,996 --> 01:55:56,031
lt's not that.

1640
01:55:58,556 --> 01:55:59,875
l wish...

1641
01:56:04,236 --> 01:56:07,433
my being Madam Kao...

1642
01:56:07,516 --> 01:56:11,748
lf what you're saying has nothing
to do with the wedding,

1643
01:56:11,836 --> 01:56:13,713
there's no need to say it.

1644
01:56:13,796 --> 01:56:16,947
Mum, l want you to know
l love Belle whatever happens.

1645
01:56:17,036 --> 01:56:21,473
That makes it even more important
for me to say it.

1646
01:56:22,036 --> 01:56:24,027
l want you all to know...

1647
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:26,392
l want you all to understand...

1648
01:56:32,356 --> 01:56:33,994
Music, music!

1649
01:56:36,276 --> 01:56:38,665

The Attorney General lent it to me.

1667
01:57:38,796 --> 01:57:40,354
