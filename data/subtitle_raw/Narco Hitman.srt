1
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,399
- Carson.

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,742
- Hello, Sergio.

3
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,676
- I'm so glad you came.

4
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,945
- I heard about Clarissa.

5
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,965
- Please, my friend.

6
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,989
Before we begin.

7
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,026
- I thought we
trusted each other.

8
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,156
- Always new rules, my friend.

9
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,933
This I must take.

10
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,004
- How did she die?

11
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,773
- What would you like?

12
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,966
- A beer.

13
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,554
A good one please.

14
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,670
- You got it, darling.

15
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,574
- It's for your next target.

16
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,388
- Not this shit again.

17
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,957
- After such success
with the Amante job,

18
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,605
you cannot be surprised
that the Patron wants more.

19
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,450
Our enemies were terrified.

20
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,474
Embrace your future.

21
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,710
- I kill clean.

22
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,607
They don't even
know they're dead.

23
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,425
I don't kill like this.

24
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,926
- Patron no longer wants death.

25
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,961
He wants horror.

26
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,419
- Sergio, I won't do it.

27
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,419
- Patron will be very
disappointed in you.

28
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,596
You wanted to know
about Clarissa.

29
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,032
Patron had Lance
deliver on their fear.

30
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,671
Does this bother you?

31
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,827
- Is the Patron
listening right now?

32
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,512
I imagine he'd wanna hear me die

33
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,984
after drinking that shit.

34
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,985
He shouldn't have killed her.

35
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,308
- My apologies my
friend but you,

36
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,131
you need to drink
your beer or die.

37
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,636
For your own good.

38
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,607
- No.

39
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,316
Hello, Patron.

40
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,386
You should not
have tortured her.

41
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,688
Now we'll both have to live
with the consequences.

42
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,179
- You there, Alice?

43
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,334
- I'm here, Paul.

44
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,602
And it's 5:05 in the
afternoon which means

45
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,253
I am off duty.

46
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,390
- Yeah, but I got this call

47
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,875
about some disturbance
at Hatchery Lake.

48
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,368
- Paul, I'm off,
have Dave do it.

49
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,714
- Dave is working an
accident up at 101.

50
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,738
So you're up.

51
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,352
. Okay-

52
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,376
Gimme the address.

53
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,939
- Hey, John, how's life?

54
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,091
- Where have you been, mom?

55
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,724
Dad said you had news for me.

56
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,935
- Listen, I'm gonna have
to call you later, sorry.

57
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,832
- Is something going on
between you and Da...

58
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,205
- Paul, I'm at the driveway.

59
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,791
Going to check things out.

60
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,992
- 10-4 Alice.

61
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,677
Call if you find anything.

62
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,096
- Shelton Police, anyone there?

63
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,479
We have received a
report of a disturbance.

64
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,028
I'll need to enter the premises.

65
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,539
- Alice, is that you?

66
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,935
Wanna get me a report?

67
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,478
Alice, you okay out there?

68
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Come on, Alice.

69
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,022
Answer the radio.

70
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,530
- My name is Carson Empman.

71
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,735
By now you will have heard of
me and the things I've done.

72
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,489
And if you have found this
letter then I have died

73
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,513
a contented man.

74
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,318
I am being hunted by the
Chutro drug cartel.

75
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,664
If their assassins find
me alive, they will bring

76
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,383
something far worse than death.

77
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,888
They will bring the serum.

78
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,724
I have at most three
days to take my revenge.

79
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,663
Then I will end my
life on my terms.

80
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,170
For what I let
happen to Clarissa,

81
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,070
I deserve nothing less.

82
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,793
- You there, Paul?

83
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,972
- Here, Alice.

84
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,293
Why weren't you answering?

85
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,161
- Who was it that gave you
the tip on this place?

86
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,646
- He wouldn't give me his name.

87
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,715
But he had a Spanish accent,
not from around here.

88
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,401
Seemed convinced there's
some foul play out there.

89
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,207
- Do me a favor, call the
man named Bob Sistek,

90
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,678
he's with the FBI.

91
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,054
Have him run a trace on the tip

92
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,660
that we got on this place.

93
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,684
- The FBI?

94
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,180
Jesus, what do you
think you found?

95
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,166
- For my entire career
with the cartel

96
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,680
I was a ghost.

97
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,123
No one had seen my face.

98
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,361
To find my jobs I just
needed four words.

99
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,463
The key.

100
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,527
It was untraceable.

101
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,197
But then came the offer
that ruined everything.

102
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,669
They wanted to meet.

103
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,334
Do I wish now I
had turned around

104
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,139
never to work for
the cartel again?

105
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,510
Never to have met Clarissa?

106
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,076
No.

107
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,186
I'd do it all again.

108
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,003
- Good day, sir.

109
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,733
You must be Carson, yes?

110
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,186
Welcome to the Aguilamonte.

111
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,907
I believe it's the most beautiful
winery outside of Spain.

112
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,224
I am Sergio the winemaker.

113
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,240
I am very honored to finally
meet you, my friend.

114
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,162
- You pay a lot of
money for the chance.

115
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,186
I hope it's worth it.

116
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,912
- Our new Patron
certainly thinks so.

117
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,835
He has much faith
in your talents.

118
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,503
- New Patron?

119
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,394
- You must learn to keep up
with current events, compadre.

120
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,722
Come, let us meet
your new family.

121
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,858
Those you must trust
now and forever more.

122
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,337
- Well.

123
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,371
As long as that means
until this job is through

124
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,402
we see eye to eye.

125
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,003
- It's your new family.

126
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,838
To the left we have Anton.

127
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,573
On your right is Lance.

128
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,759
And the beautiful lady
in front is Clarissa.

129
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,064
- Please, call me Doctor.

130
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,674
- Doctor of what, exactly?

131
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,776
- Yes, yes, yes!

132
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,556
You are here for your
distinctive abilities.

133
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
And to focus

134
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,440
solely on the task at hand.

135
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,928
As ordered by the Patron himself

136
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,797
you are to share
nothing about yourself

137
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,516
or your past with the others.

138
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,091
- Unless one is to guess
correctly, of course.

139
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,426
You see, I have a
particular talent.

140
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,107
Sort of a sixth sense,
I seem to be able

141
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,621
to guess people's worst fears.

142
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,000
Take Anton for example.

143
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,628
He seems to have a
particular aversion

144
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,082
to being burned alive.

145
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,583
- Shut your goddamn mouth.

146
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,819
- It's roasted actually.

147
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:55,323
Stuffed within a cowhide,
strung over a smoldering fire.

148
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,659
Suffocating while his flesh
melts knowing full well

149
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:02,143
that only the pain
will kill him.

150
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,744
- Say another word and you die.

151
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,051
- And that word will be to
the Patron, wouldn't it?

152
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,161
- Boys.

153
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,597
Let's get to work.

154
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,176
- Excellent idea.

155
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,668
Let's get started.

156
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,964
You all follow me please.

157
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,838
- Washington Herald.

158
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,709
- Hello, ma'am, I'm
calling for Wendy Ludlow.

159
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,531
I have a story for her.

160
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,845
- One moment please.

161
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,869
- Thank you ma'am.

162
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,870
- This is Wendy Ludlow.

163
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:56,974
Who is this?

164
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,535
- Miss Ludlow, I'm calling
to tell you the whereabouts

165
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,825
of Senator Enrique
Parker's son Jared.

166
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,877
He disappeared on
September 20th 2011.

167
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,398
- Yeah, and that
case has been closed

168
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,566
for three years.

169
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,403
- You can find him 50 meters
north of the 17th green

170
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,122
at Rock Creek golf course.

171
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,427
Bring the police and
an excavation unit.

172
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,232
If I see the story in
tomorrow's online edition

173
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,148
I will give you the
story of your career.

174
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,517
- Buddy, this will be
the story of my career

175
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,852
if you weren't full of shit.

176
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,688
- It might be time to
raise your standards.

177
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,857
I'll call you at five p.m.
tomorrow at your time.

178
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,891
Wear running shoes.

179
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,940
- But how do I know
this isn't a prank?

180
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,100
- San Antonio Post.

181
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,489
- Mitch Verplank please.

182
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
- Alice?

183
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,136
- Yeah?

184
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,771
- Got a hold of
your friend Sistek.

185
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,586
You didn't tell me he's
the guy who hired you.

186
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,589
- Yeah well he is,
so did he help you?

187
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,103
- He said the call came

188
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,793
from a switchboard
station in Vegas.

189
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,182
They can't trace it beyond that.

190
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,763
He was also very interested
in why you were asking

191
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,277
and wants you to call him back.

192
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,492
- Okay, will do.

193
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,221
So who owns this cabin?

194
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,909
- I looked that up.

195
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,811
Aaron Mickowitz.

196
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,996
All paid for.

197
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,195
Taxes are up to date.

198
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,636
- Mind tracking him down?

199
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
- Sure thing.

200
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,937
- Family, our challenge
is a simple one.

201
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,496
Mayor Morgan Amante
will soon be taking

202
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,284
drastic measures
against the Cartel.

203
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,467
Beginning with the
press conference,

204
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,515
it'll be from Tuesday.

205
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,557
Now leveraging your
unique talents,

206
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,841
we will intercept him as
he emerges from City Hall

207
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,843
on his way to the event.

208
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,564
And the Patron wants
to make it very clear

209
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,349
that a simple abduction is
not the desired option.

210
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,499
. Okay-

211
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,167
So a sniper bullet to the
head then we go have drinks.

212
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,111
- So.

213
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,626
The Patron wishes to
use this opportunity

214
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,277
to test out the
finest innovation

215
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,618
by the cartel in its
entire history.

216
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,925
Team, I present
to you the serum.

217
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,860
Lance here has developed this

218
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,842
from very particular
toxins from the world's

219
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,178
most notorious
jellyfish and spiders.

220
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,680
- Excuse me.

221
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,704
What does it do?

222
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,005
- The question is,
what does it allow?

223
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,204
Unlike conventional
paralytic elements,

224
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,989
this formula leaves
the sympathetic

225
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,558
nervous system unaffected.

226
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,050
- What the hell is
he talking about?

227
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,563
- Your heart, lungs,
anything automatic.

228
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,282
- Leaving the patient
fully paralyzed

229
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,915
and yet entirely
sensory capable.

230
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,636
They can even target a
particular vertebrae

231
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,338
and you can still talk.

232
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,558
Or scream if needed.

233
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,568
- What's the point?

234
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,103
- The effect is what matters.

235
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,351
The Patron wishes
to send a message.

236
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,740
One that cannot be ignored.

237
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,738
- Hey Alice.

238
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,924
That VIN you gave me is
from a truck in California

239
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,159
that was reported
missing two weeks ago.

240
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,132
- Did you get Mr. Mickowitz?

241
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:45,947
- Nope.

242
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,632
No one has heard from
him in two years.

243
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,386
He was last seen driving a
shipment of wine into Canada.

244
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,605
Then he just disappeared.

245
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,979
- Interesting.

246
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,077
- So can you tell me what
you found out there?

247
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,752
- Nothing.

248
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,812
I guess I just needed some time

249
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,790
to think about the
San Francisco job.

250
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,786
- Yeah, and about
leaving us behind.

251
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,163
- If I could do their level
of narco work here, I would.

252
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,279
But I can't.

253
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,303
And I need it.

254
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,300
- But John needs you.

255
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,952
Is taking off to
fight drug cartels

256
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,307
really more important?

257
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,426
Well, whatever you're
doing, our anonymous tip

258
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,316
called back asking
about your progress.

259
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,481
- What did you say?

260
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,833
- I said we don't comment
on open investigations

261
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,484
and he got pretty angry at that.

262
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,520
How do you want me
to deal with him?

263
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:49,126
- Send him to me next time.

264
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,823
- Hello, Carson Empman.

265
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,205
- How do you know my name?

266
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,163
- I know everything
about this team.

267
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,766
Names, history, sexual
preferences, everything.

268
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,215
- I don't know much
about this new Patron

269
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,901
but this seems like a good
way to get on his bad side.

270
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,707
- Aren't you even curious?

271
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,747
- No.

272
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,383
- Hmm.

273
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:46,117
Anton Delacroix has beheaded
over 200 individuals.

274
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,671
He also feels no pain
which means he can take

275
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,392
a substantial beating,
comes in handy.

276
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,535
Lance Vitoros, the Doctor.

277
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,683
Pre-eminent monster
in the cartel

278
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,175
second only to the new Patron.

279
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,242
He likes to say he
earned his Doctorate

280
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,316
by studying Nazi
experimentation on the Jews.

281
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,118
And then there's you.

282
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,388
Carson Empman, the ghost.

283
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,438
Seven years contracting
for the cartel.

284
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,227
And yet not a single body found.

285
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,471
- What else do you
know about me?

286
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,144
- Enough.

287
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,444
You left me to die.

288
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,547
- Look at him.

289
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,852
- This is Wendy.

290
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,440
- Hello, Wendy.

291
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,009
- Hello, mystery man.

292
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,844
- You work fast, well done.

293
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,045
- Thank you.

294
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,014
You wouldn't believe the
questions that I'm getting.

295
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,883
- Hear from the FBI, no
doubt, don't answer them.

296
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,907
- And ATF.

297
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,109
- You have eight minutes to
get to the bank of payphones

298
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,703
at the southeast corner
of President's Park, go.

299
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,625
- What, in heels, I can't.

300
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,242
- I told you to
wear running shoes.

301
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,917
- I am not in that
kind of shape.

302
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:23,951
- Get used to it.

303
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,386
The Feds are tracking
your phone calls.

304
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,707
This gives us time to chat.

305
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,269
Here's the game you
and I will play.

306
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,926
I do something for you, and
you do something for me.

307
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,317
I gave you a body, so in
exchange, you will add

308
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,285
a set of information
on the web article

309
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,066
that first published
Parker's disappearance.

310
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,134
- Strange request.

311
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,751
- Yeah, maybe you.

312
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,621
Are you ready?

313
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,762
Write this down.

314
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,162
Cayman America's
Bank Georgetown.

315
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,529
Hendricks.

316
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,096
Lance Vitoros.

317
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,899
12854196.

318
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,042
- Got it.

319
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,297
- You likely know I'm working
with other reporters.

320
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,914
You are all in a competition.

321
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,086
Whoever serves me best,
gets the grand prize.

322
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,774
If you fail, I will replace you.

323
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,977
If you betray me,
I pay you a visit

324
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,527
and someone finds your
body in six years.

325
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,365
- Don't try and sweet talk me.

326
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,707
What's the prize?

327
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,353
- Has anyone found who killed.

328
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,573
Sacramento mayor Morgan Amante?

329
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,545
- You were a part of that?

330
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,138
You could identify the killers?

331
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,874
- Nice chatting with you, Wendy.

332
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,715
- Alice, you gotta tell
me what's going on.

333
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,181
Why haven't you told John
about San Francisco?

334
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:20,050
I'm sure he could tell you
why there's no point to it.

335
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,207
- Goddammit Paul, he's
not changing my mind.

336
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,376
- I know you want revenge
for what happened to him.

337
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,211
But,

338
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,600
- But what?

339
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,101
- But he sold drugs for Chutro

340
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,014
and he got caught.

341
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,132
It was his choice not
to take the plea deal.

342
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,720
- Yeah, but they got to him.

343
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,371
They threatened him.

344
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,114
And now he's hard.

345
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,413
He's lost.

346
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,751
It ruined him, Paul.

347
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,268
- That's why he needs you.

348
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,091
So talk to him,
Alice, all right?

349
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,273
See what he has to say
about all of this.

350
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,822
- You know, that's a good idea.

351
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,447
- Okay, let's do a round
of contingencies.

352
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,597
- Jesus, Sergio.

353
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,451
I think we got it by now.

354
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,273
- A plan, Anton.

355
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,811
A plan is nothing more
than a beautiful dream.

356
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,383
Preparation is facing
your nightmares.

357
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,182
Let's see how we do when
things go wrong, okay?

358
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,468
All right.

359
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,790
Presence of additional
police units.

360
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,573
- Escalate the hostility
and create urgency.

361
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,621
- Good.

362
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,644
And who evaluates
effectiveness of this?

363
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,193
- I do.

364
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,114
On approach, I call Lance.

365
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,138
- Excellent.

366
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,572
And if the subterfuge is
still not successful?

367
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,157
Anton!

368
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,650
- I detonate the explosives
in the trash bin.

369
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,396
Jesus, man, why is this
shit so complicated?

370
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,445
Why can't we just kill
the motherfucker'?

371
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,319
- Even in here, Anton.

372
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,476
I can smell the vines
and the barells.

373
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,978
This is heaven!

374
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,347
The Patron told me
personally on his deathbed

375
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,703
that if we succeed, this
is once again all mine.

376
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,009
But if we fail,

377
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,669
oh Anton, if we fail.

378
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,827
Lance, would you like
to explain to the team

379
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,046
what you told me?

380
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,950
- Ah, of course.

381
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,370
Sergio has two daughters
that he loves very much

382
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,158
but he hasn't seen
in quite a while.

383
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,731
You'd be tied to a table,

384
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,960
blindfolded and gagged.

385
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,445
Your precious little angels
wouldn't be able to hear you.

386
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,152
They'll be stuffed
in a burlap sack

387
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,611
and we pour in starving rats.

388
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,107
Now these rats, they
would eat ravenously.

389
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,252
Tearing at the nubile
flesh of your daughters.

390
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,356
And when their cries
became whimpers,

391
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,160
they would nibble till
there was nothing left.

392
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,795
- Okay, that's.

393
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:25,742
So you can see

394
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,907
that if you succeed you
have everything made.

395
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,606
But if we fail, Anton.

396
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,653
It's all light with
you, we go again?

397
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,533
- Can't you pick
any place closer?

398
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,152
- No, there aren't many
banks of payphones left.

399
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,973
And I kinda like making you run.

400
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,487
- I enjoy the exercise.

401
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,611
So, what happens next?

402
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,002
- You're staying on schedule
so you get another body.

403
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,971
Her name's Catherine Gronberg.

404
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,541
She's in Connecticut.

405
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,486
Died July 12, 2011.

406
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,171
- Wait a minute, Gronberg.

407
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,839
Wasn't she that bitchy
wine magazine editor?

408
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,941
- Wow, Wendy, you
really know your stuff.

409
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,186
Yeah.

410
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,901
She's in the northeast corner
of Ashton Park in Brighton.

411
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,571
- Northeast corner of
Ashton Park Brighton.

412
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,240
Got it, you'll see it
in tomorrow's edition.

413
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,264
- Thank you, Wendy.

414
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,489
- Hey mom.

415
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,324
- Hi John, you got a second?

416
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,180
- Yeah, on a smoke break.

417
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,128
- Yeah I forgot that you,

418
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,829
- Better than
shooting heroin, mom.

419
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,665
Yeah Greg, I'll be right there.

420
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,934
So, you finally gonna
tell me what's going on?

421
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,221
- Look, I need your help.

422
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,938
Do you remember a story in
the news a few weeks back

423
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,226
about a hitman that was
confessing his kills?

424
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,658
- Why the hell are you
calling me about this?

425
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,762
- That guy was trying to
take down the Chutro cartel

426
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,650
and I'm trying to figure
out how he was doing it.

427
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,551
- Jesus, mom.

428
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,065
Do you know what
would happen to me

429
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,356
if the cartel found out I
was talking to the police?

430
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,906
Don't ever call me about this.

431
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,610
- Dammit.

432
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,230
- Alice.

433
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,535
- Yeah?

434
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,721
- That same guy called again.

435
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,660
Asked for the same update.

436
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,574
- Why didn't you send him to me?

437
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,397
- Because he
threatened you, Alice.

438
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,712
Said that two men would arrive
before dark and kill you

439
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,761
if you didn't report
what you found.

440
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,739
So you wanna tell me what
the hell is going on?

441
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,974
- Okay, it's probably,

442
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,056
- I called Sistek.

443
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,925
He sounded angry with you.

444
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,974
He wants to know what
you're doing out there.

445
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,746
So since he's your new
boss, you better call.

446
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,481
- Okay, don't worry, I got it.

447
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,058
- Mind if I sit?

448
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:04,928
- Help yourself.

449
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,998
- You're a bit more
agreeable to my presence.

450
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,635
- You're a part of the team.

451
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,701
Guess a rather well
informed part.

452
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,058
- I was sent from
Bogota to review

453
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,346
<i>as</i> well <i>as</i> assist
in the operation.

454
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,475
- Bogota?

455
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,764
So you have the ear
of the Patron?

456
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,417
- Something like that.

457
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,695
Care for a glass?

458
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,895
- No thanks.

459
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,367
- Wine too nuanced
a taste for you?

460
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,708
- No, it's a.

461
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,714
It's the insult.

462
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,383
- The insult?

463
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,486
- May I?

464
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,022
Take a look at these two.

465
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,043
The wine has been so
carefully cultivated,

466
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,731
crafted, blended and
aged all to achieve

467
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,863
this particular taste that we
are supposed to celebrate.

468
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,075
For 800 bucks a bottle, no less.

469
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,713
- 1200 actually, but go on.

470
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,779
- And you have this beer.

471
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:40,217
Made well and with
care, but not,

472
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,292
as many would say, special.

473
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:44,828
- And?

474
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,696
- And then I shoot
them both in the head.

475
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:02,074
People see the wine as a tragedy

476
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,341
while the beer, the beer
is an afterthought.

477
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,984
I have one glass of beer
a day and I savor it.

478
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,657
And there it is on the ground.

479
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Lost.

480
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,419
It's the effect we have on
the world that matters.

481
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,775
Whether you're the
wine or the beer.

482
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,114
And then to savor
what suits us best.

483
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,327
- Hello.

484
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,546
- Good morning, sunshine.

485
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,665
- How did you get
my home number?

486
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,214
And why are you calling me?

487
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,692
Jesus, you know I'm an evening
edition woman, right?

488
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,284
- Get your computer.

489
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,590
- Bossy and rude.

490
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,179
Wait, you wanna do a
video conference?

491
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,203
- Just accept.

492
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,658
- Why can't I see you?

493
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,150
- That's not part of the deal.

494
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,376
Post the next batch
of terms on the story

495
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,683
printed the day after
Catherine went missing.

496
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,702
- You didn't need to see
me to tell me that.

497
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,718
- No, but to trust you I
need to be able to look you

498
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:59,829
in the eye.

499
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,297
- Does this mean I get the key?

500
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:07,871
- The key to what?

501
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,150
- To your apartment.

502
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,505
To this matrix dummy.

503
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,711
I've seen criminal organizations
use this method before.

504
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:17,814
- All in good time.

505
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,373
- You better hurry.

506
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,697
The Chutro cartel is
scouring the earth for you.

507
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,882
- Yeah, I expected that.

508
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,690
- So what happens?

509
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,203
Why did you turn?

510
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,227
- I didn't turn.

511
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,375
They killed a woman
who needed my help.

512
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,993
We did the Amante job, split up.

513
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,362
The next thing I hear,

514
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,065
so I am responding.

515
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,178
- I love a romantic.

516
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,148
- Just get back to work.

517
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,462
Who is it?

518
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,245
I know why Anton and
Lance are here.

519
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,376
What makes you special?

520
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,855
- Sometimes a kill is a
matter of sleight of hand.

521
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,803
- I don't follow.

522
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,973
- I'm the distraction
while my partner

523
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,997
finishes the job.

524
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:47,364
- What does that make me?

525
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,834
- Do you wanna find out?

526
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,683
- I think you better leave.

527
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,367
- Sheriff Dreyer.

528
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:53,929
- Hello, Alice.

529
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,139
- Bob, is that you?

530
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,386
- I see that our calls
to your husband

531
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,775
have been ineffective.

532
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,712
- Who is this?

533
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,474
- Alice, this is the Patron.

534
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,209
I know you have
found Carson Empman

535
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,983
and have seen the punishment
inflicted on him.

536
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,158
So why have you not reported
anything to this effect?

537
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:18,838
- I'm sorry but I...

538
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,227
- You have one thing to do.

539
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:25,391
Call Rachel Sovich at
the Associated Press,

540
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:29,632
identify yourself and tell
her what you have found.

541
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,267
You understand?

542
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,106
- What will you do if I don't?

543
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:40,226
- Alice, do not risk hell

544
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,379
for a ghost.

545
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
- What?

546
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,979
Really?

547
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:11,914
Where?

548
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,517
No fucking way.

549
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,983
Shoots through the ribs.

550
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,151
- Very good.

551
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:26,973
Okay Clarissa, you're up.

552
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,795
- No, me next.

553
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:30,767
Not yet convinced.

554
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,186
. Okay-

555
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,756
Good luck.

556
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,125
- You'll need it.

557
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:59,595
- Ready, gentlemen?

558
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,031
- Ready.

559
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,439
- Ready.

560
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,369
- Okay then, go forward.

561
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
- Anton.

562
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,492
Anton!

563
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:34,992
Anton, goddammit!

564
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,430
- Just as I thought.

565
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,078
- Thought what?

566
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,582
- Asshole.

567
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,444
- Right cheek, actually.

568
00:45:58,322 --> 00:45:59,132
- Good work.

569
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,167
Lance, you are paralyzed.

570
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,625
Okay, let's go get some lunch.

571
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:05,995
- Wait.

572
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,380
I think I finally figured
you out, Clarissa.

573
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,599
- Lance, do not tell her.

574
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:18,941
- You wanna be free.

575
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,278
Confinement.

576
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,781
That's your fear.

577
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,650
I wouldn't touch a
hair on your head.

578
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,887
We'd wrap you in carpet,
duct tape it tight

579
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,571
and give you air and an IV,

580
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,292
shove you in a box and
bury you underground.

581
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,923
- Lance, enough!

582
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,635
- You would try to
stay calm at first.

583
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,908
Then you would panic and
fight to move even an inch.

584
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,890
Then you would
pass out exhausted

585
00:46:56,914 --> 00:47:01,044
just to wake to the true
nightmare of no escape again

586
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,789
and again and again.

587
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:08,891
- I'll remember that.

588
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,151
- Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

589
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,836
Special Agent Sistek.

590
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,254
- Bob, it's Alice.

591
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,956
Both Paul and I have
received very disturbing

592
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,458
death threats from
an anonymous caller.

593
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,427
Is there anything you can
do to track down this guy?

594
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,163
- Alice, it's about
time you contacted me.

595
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,212
What the hell do you think
you're doing out there?

596
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,001
- I don't know.

597
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,170
- What's funny is
I got a call too.

598
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,561
A source of mine says you
found a cartel hitman.

599
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,157
The cartel hitman, is that true?

600
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,937
- I don't know what I found.

601
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,348
John?

602
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,947
- Hey, sorry about before.

603
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,253
Hearing the word Chutro
just makes me angry.

604
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,500
- I know.

605
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:15,524
And I'm sorry.

606
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,092
- I checked up on
the hitman for you.

607
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,062
This guy's plan was incredible.

608
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,529
- What was he trying to do?

609
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,677
- He was sharing the
financial information

610
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,568
of the team that assassinated
that mayor Amante.

611
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,117
Reporters have published
their names, bank accounts,

612
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,852
routing numbers,
transaction IDs.

613
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,674
But in unconnected pieces.

614
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,659
- Did it work?

615
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,481
- No, he didn't provide a key.

616
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:44,252
- Key, what do you mean?

617
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,379
- The key is how you
connect everything.

618
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,236
It's how drug agents
communicate anonymously.

619
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,955
Four random words
they search for

620
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,690
that returns one page that
links it all together.

621
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,596
- What would you use
to make the key?

622
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,013
- I think he was using
the names of those

623
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:00,914
in the hit squad.

624
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,599
But he only published three.

625
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,334
Empman, Vitoros and Delacroix.

626
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,054
If someone could find
that fourth name,

627
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,706
they might be able to
finish what he started.

628
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,693
Just be careful, okay?

629
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,261
- I Will.

630
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,285
Thanks for your help.

631
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,224
Four words.

632
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,153
- Fuck him.

633
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,012
- Who was the woman?

634
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,341
- I was married once.

635
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,548
- So you have a heart after all.

636
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,285
- Not anymore.

637
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,797
- I'm sorry, it's
none of my business.

638
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:49,478
- Her name was Abby.

639
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,872
We were out in the backcountry.

640
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,744
Hunting, we've been drinking.

641
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,289
I was drunk.

642
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,359
My gun went off.

643
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,059
Caught her right in the gut.

644
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,629
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

645
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,403
I left camp.

646
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,609
By the time I got back,
it was too late.

647
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,646
Her face all contorted
from the pain.

648
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:32,988
What I wish is,

649
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,069
I wish I would have
just gone back,

650
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,790
snuck back in and put a bullet
in the back of her head.

651
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,008
She never would have known

652
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,659
and she never would
have suffered.

653
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,395
Killing people quickly
is the closest thing

654
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,531
to good I know how to do.

655
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,674
Can I help you?

656
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,121
- Yeah, you own this place?

657
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,145
- My uncle does.

658
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,992
- That's funny.

659
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,126
We've been by here a few times

660
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,163
and we've never seen anybody
check up on it before.

661
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,187
- Well here I am.

662
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,602
- So we don't think
you own this place.

663
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,105
And we need it.

664
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,324
We'd rather not kill you.

665
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,909
Gunshots attract the
kind of attention

666
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,196
that we don't need right now.

667
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,953
Look.

668
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,822
We just need a place to lay
low for a couple days.

669
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,211
If it's all the same to you,

670
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,637
how about that gun of yours?

671
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,880
- John, you won't believe
what I figured out.

672
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,661
- Mom, I looked
into this some more

673
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,119
and you can be in some trouble.

674
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,416
- He's not looking to
expose the hit squad.

675
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,000
He's looking to
expose everything.

676
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,236
- I need you to think
about your safety.

677
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,670
They could be listening
to you right now!

678
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,340
- Every kill he confessed to is
related to wine in some way.

679
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,390
He's giving us a map to how
the entire system worked.

680
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,347
Distributors, politicians,
even goddamn wine reviewers.

681
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,381
' System?

682
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,405
What system?

683
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:40,653
- The Aguilamonte winery is
a gigantic money launderer.

684
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:41,921
And through the other
contract killers,

685
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,090
he's tying together the entire.

686
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,082
Chutro financial organization.

687
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,707
- Mom, stop.

688
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,097
I need you to be quiet
and forget everything

689
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,598
you just said.

690
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,953
- John, this is huge, I,

691
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,034
- Mom!

692
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,168
Didn't you hear
about what happened

693
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:59,059
to those newspaper reporters
that Empman was working with?

694
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:00,963
- No, I didn't.

695
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,329
- You don't know how
bad these people are.

696
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,408
- Washington Herald.

697
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,740
- Hey, Wendy Ludlow please.

698
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,294
- Oh Jesus.

699
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,561
- Ma'am is everything all right?

700
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,883
- She's, Miss Ludlow is missing.

701
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,268
- What are you talking about?

702
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,659
- Are you the man she
was working with?

703
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,230
- Where's Wendy?

704
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:39,159
- They told me to read you this.

705
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,828
Carson, give up if you
want to save her life.

706
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,950
Or wait and have
both of you suffer.

707
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:45,974
- Oh shit.

708
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,975
- This is a police recording.

709
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,060
If you have information

710
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,928
on the whereabouts
of Mitch Verplank,

711
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,477
please contact the Dallas F...

712
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,034
- Sacramento 'Times.

713
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,468
- Manuel Cortez please.

714
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,652
- This is Special Agent Sistek.

715
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,166
Who am I speaking with, please?

716
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,643
- I need to speak with
Manuel Cortez now.

717
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:31,630
- So, you must be Carson.

718
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,850
Looks like the Patron
got ahead of your game.

719
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,325
- Is he alive?

720
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,491
- That's very hard to say.

721
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,374
This newspaper received
a video this morning

722
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,526
showing staff reporter
Manuel Cortez

723
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,227
being wrapped in cowhide
and strung up over a fire.

724
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,331
You spoke with this man
yesterday, correct?

725
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,185
- Yes.

726
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,387
- Well the video
continued to show.

727
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:58,507
Mr. Cortez being roasted
alive for over three hours.

728
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,882
I think it's about time
for you to help us out.

729
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:52,841
- What are they doing with him?

730
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,732
- It's one of our lab rats.

731
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,401
- I thought the
serum was finished.

732
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,173
- They want to get
the dosage light.

733
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:05,447
- Who is he?

734
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,462
- Someone who didn't
successfully curry

735
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,147
the Patron's favor,
I would guess.

736
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:16,323
Tell me about you and Clarissa.

737
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,656
- Has your sixth sense
figured me out yet?

738
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,462
- Not yet, but soon.

739
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,268
Has Sergio given
you his pitch yet?

740
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,040
- Pitch? No.

741
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,049
- I imagine that you'll accept.

742
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:48,434
You have a talent for
suffering I think

743
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,256
that you've yet to appreciate.

744
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,139
It was years ago, there
was a method I heard of

745
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,790
that I thought was
quite brilliant.

746
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,857
Takes just one bullet.

747
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,400
You hit a precise
spot in the abdomen.

748
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,841
Severs the intercostal nerve.

749
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,786
It's excruciating pain,
a slow bleed out.

750
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,576
But the mastery was
in the performance.

751
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,507
You staged it as an accident.

752
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,799
You told her you were
gonna go get help

753
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,702
but you gave her hope so
that she would endure

754
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,559
for as long as possible,
as long as her strength

755
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,131
would hold out.

756
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,400
Then you came back
at the last moment

757
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,029
just to laugh at her
before she dies.

758
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,046
Suffering is such a
complex emotion.

759
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,618
There's so many shapes, colors.

760
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,015
It's beautiful really.

761
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:03,125
You should embrace
this talent of yours.

762
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,898
- Office of the mayor.

763
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,117
- Margaret Amante please.

764
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,052
- May I ask who's calling?

765
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,330
- I am the man who
murdered her husband.

766
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,208
- It's him.

767
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,097
- Connect me in 30 seconds.

768
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,635
If she wants me caught,
I only speak to her.

769
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,244
- She will speak to you.

770
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,039
Call back in 15 minutes.

771
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:52,571
- Exactly 15.

772
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,183
- Your radios and
cellphones for tomorrow.

773
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:07,562
All ready, my friends.

774
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,630
Carson, please, sit.

775
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,677
We have one more piece
of business to discuss.

776
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,661
I have made an offer to
the rest of the team

777
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,663
and they have all accepted.

778
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,655
I'm about to make the
same offer to you.

779
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,268
- Another job like this?

780
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,292
I don't think so.

781
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,528
- Not a job, my
friend, a career.

782
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,188
Your contract rate
would increase

783
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,892
to one million dollars
per assignment.

784
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,500
Complete four jobs in a year

785
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,858
and you receive a four
million dollar bonus.

786
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,108
- What changes?

787
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,611
- A certain degree of.

788
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,215
- Torture?

789
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:03,819
- Penance.

790
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,932
That was the word that
I was looking for.

791
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:07,833
And don't worry, my friend.

792
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,121
We can offer you all
the training you need.

793
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,655
We need good men
like you, Carson.

794
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:15,941
Consider it.

795
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:18,777
- Do not miss out on this
opportunity, Carson.

796
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,462
The Patron would
be most grateful.

797
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,272
- You get to be my understudy.

798
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,318
- I don't torture people.

799
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,106
- You'd learn to like it.

800
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,571
- You still don't know, do you?

801
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:36,374
- Oh I think I'm getting close.

802
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,632
- How about I just tell you?

803
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,282
I'd hate for you
to get it wrong.

804
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:49,490
Take me somewhere remote
where I may never be found.

805
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,180
Slice off my fingertips,
peel the skin

806
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,082
off of my tattoos.

807
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,252
Pour acid on my face,
burning out my eyes.

808
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,973
Leave me completely
unrecognizable.

809
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,240
Then rip out my teeth
and tear out my tongue

810
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:13,732
and as I died, I know that
even when I was found

811
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,068
they would never know who I was.

812
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,356
I would leave no legacy

813
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:23,825
except my own excruciating hell.

814
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:36,668
- Strange how someone
that prizes anonymity

815
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:38,611
would fear that of all things.

816
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,385
- Yes.

817
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,121
Strange.

818
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,395
I'll think about it.

819
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,444
I am beginning to believe
that I will not succeed.

820
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:11,757
Whoever you are, share this
letter with the world.

821
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:13,258
Whoever you are, share this
letter with the world.

822
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,374
They will want to know.

823
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,479
Just put the following
words in sequence

824
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,587
in whatever you say.

825
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:22,952
Do that and the
cartel will fall.

826
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,030
- Who is Clarissa, Carson?

827
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:35,827
- Hello, Alice.

828
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:39,608
- Hello, Patron.

829
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,238
- You have not made the call to Mrs.
Sovich.

830
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,346
- No.

831
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,078
- Why you make such a mistake?

832
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,751
- Because you want
the world to know

833
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,984
what you'll do to anyone
who gets in your way.

834
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,254
- Alice, I know how hard it was

835
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:05,358
for you to see your son
in prison three years.

836
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:11,005
But he knew that
whatever he faced inside

837
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:16,505
was nothing compared to
the price of betrayal.

838
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:22,661
Do you wish for him to
suffer now because of you?

839
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,847
- Okay Patron, I understand.

840
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,216
I understand completely.

841
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,381
I'll call Sovich right now.

842
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,537
- Because we can take him

843
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:36,074
from his garage in Olympia
whenever we want.

844
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:36,894
Do you understand?

845
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,978
- Yes, goddammit, I understand.

846
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,961
- Don't make me come for you.

847
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,689
- They won't turn
me into a monster.

848
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,120
- That's why they
brought you here.

849
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:15,904
Well what now?

850
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,272
- I'll do the job and disappear.

851
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:21,376
- They'll find you.

852
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,780
Let's leave.

853
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,228
Now.

854
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:31,845
I wanna be done with the cartel.

855
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,169
- Good luck tomorrow.

856
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,949
- Goddamn you.

857
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,867
- Is this a prank?

858
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,535
- Hello, Margaret, no it is not.

859
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,473
- Then why are you calling me?

860
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,541
- To give you vengeance.

861
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,129
- I don't,

862
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,279
I don't want vengeance.

863
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,320
- I am sorry but I need you.

864
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,670
I had four reporters that
were gonna do your job.

865
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,560
- Do you know what is
happening to them?

866
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,008
They are being tortured every
day until you are found.

867
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,543
- Yes.

868
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,567
Yes I do.

869
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:54,502
And we can help them.

870
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,062
- Tell me how.

871
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,007
- Alice, what you got for me?

872
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,560
- They're threatening my son.

873
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,229
I need you to send someone to
his garage to protect him.

874
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,948
- Try and calm down.

875
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,250
Who's threatening him?

876
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,051
- The Chutro drug cartel.

877
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:18,703
- All right, listen
carefully, Alice.

878
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,906
If you want this job
in San Francisco,

879
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,298
you hang up and do what
they asked you to do.

880
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,244
- I am begging you Bob, please.

881
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,736
Protect my son.

882
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,981
- All right, we have
men on the way.

883
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,850
- To watch my son?

884
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:33,418
- To you, Alice.

885
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,376
Now do what the Patron asks.

886
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,316
- Associated Press.

887
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,752
- Rachel Sovich please.

888
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,381
- If I do nothing,
you're dead anyway.

889
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:52,992
What could I
possibly give to you

890
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:54,221
that is in my interest?

891
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,676
- A public announcement.

892
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,277
- Go on.

893
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,429
- I want to destroy Chutro.

894
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,470
But to do that I need a war

895
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,752
between all the cartels.

896
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,302
If they all have access
to the same information

897
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:13,279
at the same time, they will
all go after Chutro at once.

898
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,578
Anything short of that
means nothing will happen.

899
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,310
- What do you need me to do?

900
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:26,459
- You will announce that the
man who murdered your husband

901
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,273
is giving himself up.

902
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,297
- He is?

903
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:33,278
- Schedule a press conference,
get on the five o'clock news,

904
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,813
put the microphone
up to the speaker

905
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,305
and I will give everything up.

906
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,864
- Five p.m. tonight.

907
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:39,974
Pacific time.

908
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:41,943
Call me then.

909
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,170
- Thank you, Margaret.

910
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,060
- I've been anxiously
awaiting your call,

911
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:50,262
Sheriff Dreyer.

912
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,598
This will be headline news
across the country tomorrow.

913
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,500
You are going to be famous.

914
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,515
- Are you working
with him, the Patron?

915
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,651
- I'm just doing
my job, Sheriff.

916
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,974
So I hear you have some
gory details for me.

917
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,261
Tell me about the body.

918
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,129
- Got what appears
to be a homicide.

919
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,735
Male victim,
deceased a few days.

920
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:18,807
Fingertips, patches of skin and
the scalp have been removed.

921
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:24,696
Face, teeth, tongue removed.

922
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,586
- Now I have sources
that indicate

923
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,867
a letter was found?

924
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,019
- You are working with
them, you little shit.

925
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,104
Yes, I found a letter.

926
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,674
- So, did he really
suffer all that

927
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:36,790
just for a woman?

928
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:51,546
- The woman.

929
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:58,163
John, don't hang up.

930
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:01,233
The hit on Amante, there
was a woman on the team.

931
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,067
Who was she?

932
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,752
- Mom, no one knows.

933
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,036
- This was a big target.

934
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,705
They would have used
their best people.

935
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,707
Any idea who she could be?

936
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,927
- The cartel hires dozens
of contract killers,

937
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,210
men and women.

938
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,066
- Anyone named Clarissa?

939
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,589
- So you agreed to the deal?

940
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,905
- Never had much of a
choice now, did we?

941
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,124
- You could have said no.

942
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,866
- I don't know what kind
of life you've lived,

943
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:50,515
but all my choices have been
either to live a nightmare

944
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:51,836
or be the nightmare.

945
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,535
Either way, the nightmare
just keeps getting worse.

946
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,081
But shit, it don't
even matter then now.

947
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:03,194
Probably won't live long enough

948
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,310
for it to be an issue.

949
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:06,311
- What does that mean?

950
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,657
- I mean you and Clarissa.

951
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,806
Man, how could you be so stupid?

952
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,830
- That is over.

953
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:17,542
We're through.

954
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:18,566
- We're a team, man.

955
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,069
We're family.

956
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,632
We succeed together,
we betray together.

957
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,740
- Betray?

958
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:27,534
Who did I betray?

959
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:32,557
- Well at least Clarissa would
suffer just as bad, huh?

960
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:33,581
Or maybe even worse.

961
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:35,760
What, I guess you're
just gonna hope

962
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:36,979
she keeps her mouth shut?

963
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,716
- Anton, what the fuck
are you talking about?

964
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,030
- Your little affair

965
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,397
was with Clarissa
Annabelle Chutro.

966
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,697
She's the new Patron's wife.

967
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:10,880
- Perhaps I had it wrong.

968
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,550
Perhaps I'm writing to
someone else entirely.

969
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,535
Maybe the person
holding this letter

970
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,049
is the one sent to torture me.

971
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,357
Maybe you were too late.

972
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,878
Together with Margaret Amante
we will show the world

973
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,234
how to take down
Chutro and the Patron.

974
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,198
And my penance will be complete.

975
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,590
- John, one more thing.

976
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,741
- No mom, stop trying
to figure this out.

977
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:57,596
Just let it be.

978
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,565
- There was going to
be a press conference

979
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,346
and Empman was calling in.

980
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,515
Amante's wife Margaret
was putting it on.

981
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,550
- No, there wasn't.

982
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,419
- Empman was going to
admit to everything.

983
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,138
Why was it cancelled?

984
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:12,257
- Mom, there never was gonna
be a press conference.

985
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,215
She set that up to
track his cellphone.

986
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,475
Looked like it worked.

987
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:38,873
- Yeah.

988
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:45,379
On it.

989
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,849
You are welcome at any time.

990
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,076
- I'm just saying I
think that we could try

991
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,744
and reschedule the one meeting.

992
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:07,946
- Well, can we just,

993
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,547
for this one can we
just keep the questions

994
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:11,049
to half an hour?

995
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,817
- You're declaring
that you will end

996
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,139
bribery and corruption
in the city.

997
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,322
There are going to be
a lot of questions.

998
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,644
- I'm just really nervous.

999
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,959
- Well, you're gonna piss off

1000
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,247
some very dangerous people.

1001
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:27,946
- Excuse me sir, may I help you?

1002
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,055
- He's coming down the steps.

1003
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:31,990
20 seconds.

1004
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,905
- I need that script.

1005
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:36,398
If I say too little,
this thing can blow up.

1006
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,109
And if I say too much
of the wrong thing,

1007
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,294
I can go to prison.

1008
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:41,269
- Or worse.

1009
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,518
- Sweety, you will be fine.

1010
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,969
Short concise answers.

1011
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,871
- 10 seconds, keep going.

1012
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,706
- Sir, you're going
to have to leave.

1013
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:45,394
- Don't over-explain.

1014
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:47,745
- Five seconds, get ready.

1015
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,136
- This is my last warning!

1016
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,229
- Just try and stick
to the talking points

1017
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,341
that we discussed.

1018
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,853
- Do it now.

1019
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,572
Do it now, make a count.

1020
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,807
- That's it, out!

1021
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:04,109
- Excuse me.

1022
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:05,219
- What is she doing?

1023
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,932
- Just let the staff handle it.

1024
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,151
- That's the problem.

1025
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,602
We can't have headlines of a,

1026
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,290
of a beating on,

1027
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,727
- Morgan, are you all right?

1028
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,299
- He's all yours.

1029
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:20,928
- Hello, Carson.

1030
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:24,809
- It hurts.

1031
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:25,833
- Morgan?

1032
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,146
Somebody help me.

1033
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,035
- I'm a Doctor, what's wrong?

1034
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,571
- Stop right there.

1035
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,483
- Look, I'm from St. Michaels.

1036
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,518
Now please let me through.

1037
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,839
And somebody call 911.

1038
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:38,902
- Let him through.

1039
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,529
- Is he gonna be all right?

1040
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,384
- I don't know, dammit.

1041
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,784
It could be an obstruction.

1042
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,418
The Patron says, hello, Mayor.

1043
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:55,354
And he thanks you
for your betrayal.

1044
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,091
And in return, your
family will now watch

1045
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:04,332
as you suffer the
most exquisite death.

1046
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,604
Welcome to hell.

1047
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:20,231
- Carson, my amigo.

1048
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,255
- Hello, Patron.

1049
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,290
They told me you were dead.

1050
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:28,724
That you'd been tortured.

1051
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,295
- Yeah, that was my doing.

1052
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:38,916
I let the Patron believe
that you loved me

1053
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,964
so he wanted you dead.

1054
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,105
So I convinced him to let me
set the trap with Sergio.

1055
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,578
- So you wanted me dead.

1056
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:48,910
- I hadn't decided yet.

1057
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:53,617
- What are you doing here?

1058
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,120
- I'm the distraction.

1059
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,510
- I've waited a long
time for this, Carson.

1060
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,660
- As you now realize,
this was all for you.

1061
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:40,044
You now are a monster like us.

1062
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,765
I will call on you
again soon, compadre.

1063
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:48,653
- You've been injected
with a paralytic serum

1064
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,169
with a careful dose of acid.

1065
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,658
And you shall die in
the next eight hours.

1066
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:54,682
But do not worry.

1067
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,152
We found a replacement for you.

1068
01:20:57,252 --> 01:21:01,120
Someone to keep things
just the way they were.

1069
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:05,991
That should stabilize him.

1070
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:07,687
And where's that damn ambulance?

1071
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:36,617
- You were so
close, weren't you?

1072
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:00,214
You ready?

1073
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,877
- Congratulations, Alice.

1074
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:09,867
You completed your
fist assignment.

1075
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,402
You just let the world
know what happens

1076
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,019
when you try to
cross the Patron.

1077
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:16,841
And for a moment I think
you had it in you

1078
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:17,865
to follow orders.

1079
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:20,912
- So was that enough for you?

1080
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,079
<i>'</i> Yes.

1081
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,037
Thanks Alice,
you've done enough.

1082
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,184
I look forward to having
you down here on the team.

1083
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,208
- Go to hell.

1084
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:40,116
- Clarissa, step aside.

1085
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,164
- Does this scare you, Lance?

1086
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:58,604
- And why would it?

1087
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,837
- Because this sure as
hell isn't my worst fear.

1088
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,614
- Your turn, Lance.

1089
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,963
- If you are reading
this then I'm dead.

1090
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:31,098
You must finish
what I've started.

1091
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:33,964
With the information
provided here

1092
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:37,477
you now possess the map to
seven hundred million dollars

1093
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:39,673
of the Chutro cartel's assets.

1094
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,428
Use it to destroy them.

1095
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:45,715
Do whatever is necessary.

1096
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:48,422
I'm counting on you.

1097
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:54,053
If you fail me, then
know even in my death

1098
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:56,631
that a ghost will
soon pay you a visit.

1099
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:01,913
- Sheriff Dreyer.

1100
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,782
- Alice, you were just in time.

1101
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,484
- Will my son be left alone?

1102
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,340
- Well, for now.

1103
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,309
But we will keep an eye on him.

1104
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:15,643
Now I wonder why you took
such risks for a dead man.

1105
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,585
Perhaps you will
tell me when you are

1106
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:20,779
in San Francisco.

1107
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,282
- Perhaps not.

1108
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,881
I might not have what it takes.

1109
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:30,541
- Then until we meet
again, Sheriff Dreyer.

1110
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:31,565
- Patron.
