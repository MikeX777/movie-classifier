1
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:24,037
Quick… Run!

2
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:32,051
Get him in!

3
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:35,067
Come in, quick!

4
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,093
Boss, we can’t run away.

5
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,042
Ask the police for a car.

6
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:54,010
You’ll never get away, surrender at once!

7
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:59,072
I want a car, $20 million cash.
Hurry up, or I’m gonna kill her!

8
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:01,009
Let me go!

9
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,064
Calm down, I’m going to contact my superiors.

10
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,067
Okay, you have 20 minutes.

11
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:07,044
Stay calm.

12
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:10,015
20 minutes isn’t enough to prepare $20 million.

13
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:13,032
We can talk if you guarantee the safety of the hostages.

14
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:15,076
You have 30 minutes.

15
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:18,003
If I don’t see the car and
money in 30 minutes,

16
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,080
I’ll kill the hostages and
throw down on the street.

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,037
I’m going to kill one every 5 minutes.

18
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:27,007
We’ve blocked the scene.

19
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,007
No cars are allowed to drive past.

20
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,020
No casualties at the moment, report.

21
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,035
– Here.
– Thanks.

22
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:38,064
Yachi, the three criminals are
holding hostages on the roof,

23
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,003
we can’t get close.

24
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,090
Did you get their identities?

25
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,067
They should be from mainland China.

26
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:47,091
They won’t surrender, prepare for a raid.

27
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,056
It’s dangerous here, they have hostages.

28
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:54,074
Call for SDU.

29
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,066
Have you found Mumble yet?

30
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,095
Officer Chi, Mumble cannot be contacted.

31
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:03,084
Keep on looking for him.

32
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,061
Yes, Sir!

33
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:06,012
Mumble, you bastard!

34
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:27,018
Yeah, how is it now?

35
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,044
Sell 200,000 share of HK Bank, yes.

36
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:34,034
Good, thanks.

37
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,002
What perfume is it?

38
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:47,077
Coniba, good taste.

39
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:57,049
London stock market is bull,
Wall Street is soon down, I want—

40
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:02,004
I don’t care about London,
I care only about screwing.

41
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,036
I come here just to try to get a man.

42
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,030
Let’s go to toilet for a screw.

43
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:11,090
Directly and waste no time.

44
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,027
He’s coming too?

45
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:16,012
He’s into toilets.

46
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,028
Listen carefully.

47
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,026
We are to deal with three criminals.

48
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:27,037
They have one AK-47 and two pistols.
We must rescue four hostages, too.

49
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:29,022
We must guarantee safety of the hostages.

50
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:08,021
The criminals injured three of our men.

51
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,029
They have four girls as hostages.

52
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:12,029
It’s hard to get close to them.

53
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,028
Let me take over.

54
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,001
One lay $3000, overnight $5000.

55
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:34,009
The three criminals are scattered at the moment.

56
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:36,040
We have only three positions.

57
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,019
Get three snipers, and shoot at the same time.

58
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:44,037
I repeat, the three snipers must
shoot at the same time, understand?

59
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,030
Yes, Sir!

60
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:48,057
Remember, you mustn’t harm the hostages.

61
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,050
Go! Go!

62
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:54,002
How come Mumble is not here?

63
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:55,020
I want to see him too.

64
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:04,024
Damn, how come I have no luck at all?

65
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,069
Miss, your “Blow job.”

66
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:48,066
Sir, Mumble hasn’t arrived yet,
we’re missing one sniper.

67
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,009
Siu Ming, Siu Ming!

68
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,015
Yes, Sir.

69
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,030
You take the place of Mumble.

70
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,076
– Get changed!
– Yes, sir.

71
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,074
Siu Ming is only a driver, can he manage?

72
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:09,086
Of course, he arrested the
fleeing prisoner last week.

73
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:20,019
Hallo, it’s Yachi. Get him.

74
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,030
Ten.

75
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,011
Ten.

76
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,056
Ten.

77
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,005
Ten, ten! Drink!

78
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,026
What do you want?

79
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,007
Smoking.

80
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:53,008
I was asking him. What do you want?

81
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,080
Can you make it? Well, I can’t.

82
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:57,060
Cut me some slack.

83
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,048
– Crap, he’s gone.
– Hey!

84
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,072
Be quiet! Don’t move!

85
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,062
I said don’t move!

86
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,056
Locked on target.

87
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:35,019
Locked on target.

88
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:39,041
Don’t move, or I’m gonna kill you.

89
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:47,043
Siu Ming on target.

90
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,090
If I succeed with this task, there’ll be promotion,
I won’t be just a driver anymore.

91
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,022
OK, men, let’s get ready to save the hostages!

92
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,074
I think we should wait for Mumble.

93
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:13,032
Look here, stop trying to fuck around.

94
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:17,006
In five minutes, the criminals
will start killing people.

95
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:25,059
Hallo? Mumble, where have you been?

96
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:29,051
I’ve just located the fleeing prisoner
so I wasn’t able to call you back.

97
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,000
I know his address already.

98
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:33,037
Go check tomorrow, I’m coming now.

99
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:37,049
That prisoner was arrested by our driver last week.

100
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,007
He’s being detained in custody.

101
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:41,055
We need one sniper.

102
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,074
Ask Officer Chi to wait for me.

103
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:46,025
He asked the driver Siu Ming to take your place.

104
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,010
Driver Siu Ming? He won’t make it.

105
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,062
He keeps drinking coffee, he has numb hands.

106
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,096
You’ll fire on my count of three.

107
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,025
I’ve found Mumble, he says—

108
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,046
I don’t give a damn.

109
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:01,062
Boys, watch out, we have only one chance.

110
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:03,062
We’ve got no time for another shot.

111
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:07,003
Get our men to rescue the hostages.

112
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,048
Ready, 1, 2…

113
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,067
Wait, Officer Chi, wait…

114
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,024
Are we shooting after 1, 2, 3 or after 1, 2, 3, Fire?

115
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:32,076
Come on, ready, 1, 2, 3…

116
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:37,053
Idiot!

117
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,001
Let go.

118
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:51,017
When I count three, you fire.

119
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,004
I didn’t say fire, stupid shit!

120
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:54,006
Thanks, Officer.

121
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,016
All ready.

122
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:02,017
1, 2, 3!

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,054
Oh, shit!

124
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:43,030
My God! Shit!

125
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:19,062
I’ve said we must wait for Mumble…

126
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:24,062
Well done, the criminals are dead, so are the hostages.

127
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,086
Siu Ming, why didn’t you fire?

128
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:37,099
Siu Ming, why did you
take a gun, you are a driver.

129
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,078
You drink too much coffee
and your hands are trembling.

130
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,027
I’ll drink less coffee.

131
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,068
Dare you talk back?

132
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,063
Thanks for teaching my men.

133
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,029
You’re welcome, Officer Chi.
We’re in the same team. Right, Siu Ming?

134
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:55,045
Bastard! I’ve been tolerate.

135
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:58,018
Did you enjoy it, touching my dead body?

136
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:00,066
I’ll kill you! I’ll cut your head!

137
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:04,069
– Molester! Damn!
– Come on, it’s all right.

138
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:10,029
Is it just a drill? But it’s so realistic.

139
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,080
Two vodkas, one dozen of beer.

140
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,037
Go on drinking.

141
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:22,007
You’re fired.

142
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:40,070
Can you smooth things over for me?

143
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:55,023
Why are they taking a drill so seriously?

144
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,053
They didn’t have to fire me, did they?

145
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,036
I’m a sniper, anyway.

146
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:04,052
Look, I’ve been champion for three years.

147
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:07,031
You’ll be taught a lesson without me.

148
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:08,068
Don’t call me back.

149
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:10,050
We don’t want to see you again.

150
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,098
Call you back? They’re celebrating your leaving.

151
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:17,069
Most of the policewomen complained
of you for sexual harassment.

152
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:21,080
There’re are so many works outside.

153
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,095
I’ll help you to find a job.

154
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:29,096
I’m fired, I’ve lost my pension.
How can I stand a chance?

155
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:37,071
There is a chance, my dream girl.

156
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,071
Why is the red light on?

157
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:35,086
How many guests?

158
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,008
Let’s go, that guy is scary.

159
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:39,098
Welcome.

160
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,038
This is my restaurant, come in.

161
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:50,017
Great, big bust!

162
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,030
I think this job suits you.

163
00:15:56,076 --> 00:16:00,000
You didn’t have to cut it, it’s no newspaper.

164
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,020
This is the same like SDU.

165
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:05,007
It’s USD, driving garbage car.

166
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:07,042
You’re a good driver, it suits you.

167
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:12,027
What? It requires a graduation
and ten years experience?

168
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,004
I’m not up to it, man.

169
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,064
Sorry, I’ve cut more.

170
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:20,069
It’s an add for a bank director.

171
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:30,056
How many… guests?

172
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:46,063
Miss, what can bring you?

173
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:47,096
Orange juice, please.

174
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,035
Wow, so quick!

175
00:16:56,035 --> 00:17:01,044
Miss, have you come alone in this rain?

176
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,065
I’ll drink the juice with you.

177
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,024
You must be upset.

178
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,040
Your eyes tell me you need a man for the night.

179
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,016
But your body tells me you
can’t accompany for tonight.

180
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,023
I don’t understand.

181
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:23,006
I understand now.

182
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:29,051
Bye-bye.

183
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,074
How many guests?

184
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:48,082
Hey, help me, please, smartie.

185
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,026
Hey, can you see them?

186
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,003
The guys over there.

187
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,059
They want to kill me.

188
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,024
If you help me, I’ll give you a kiss, OK?

189
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:04,059
Kiss me? OK, why didn’t you say it earlier?

190
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:10,002
Go away, this girl doesn’t like you. Shoo!

191
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,048
Excuse me, it’s none of your business.

192
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:15,059
I know, but this is his business.

193
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:18,045
What do you want?

194
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:25,003
Want to take advantage?

195
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,013
Don’t panic.

196
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:51,017
What did you promise me just then?

197
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,027
Did you help me just then?

198
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:56,078
You helped me, come on.

199
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:01,043
I’ll leave now, thanks.

200
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,080
I haven’t paid yet.

201
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:09,045
Here.

202
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,064
No need for so much.

203
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:14,000
It’s OK, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

204
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:16,061
Master, we need to pay too.

205
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:18,055
Wait, drink some more.

206
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:21,048
Drink, he knocked out the four guys
because they didn’t want to drink.

207
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:22,026
OK.

208
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,064
Monster, you took my girl!

209
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:32,061
How can you make it up? Look at me!

210
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:44,084
You’re wet, mind you’ll catch cold.

211
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:49,038
Why are you following me? I’ve paid already.

212
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:51,004
Have you paid for the taxi, too?

213
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,081
Let me walk you home.

214
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,061
No, thanks.

215
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,092
Those four guys haven’t left yet.

216
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,067
I’m afraid you’ll run into danger.

217
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:04,028
You are afraid? Go away if you fear, I fear nothing.

218
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:09,045
What about coming to my place?

219
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,075
Take shelter.

220
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:13,028
OK.

221
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,075
But you mustn’t regret.

222
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:18,080
Where do you live?

223
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,067
Upstairs of the pub.

224
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,090
Come on…

225
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,072
Let me think over.

226
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:37,009
Welcome.

227
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,017
Make yourself at home.

228
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,022
Hey, where are you going?

229
00:20:48,054 --> 00:20:50,023
You ask me to make myself at home.

230
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,040
But no one asks me where
I’m going when I’m at home.

231
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:56,046
Want to go to bedroom? That is not my room.

232
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:01,015
I see, want a bath?

233
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:28,005
Do you have 100% feel?

234
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,067
Does it hurt? You regret now?

235
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:15,059
Do I look regretful?

236
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,078
I’m going to sleep now.

237
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,005
OK.

238
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,089
What a nice toy!

239
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,009
What are you doing here?

240
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:28,057
Mickey Mouse?

241
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,077
What? Don’t you like Mickey Mouse?

242
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:37,016
Hey, don’t play a fool since you came here.

243
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,055
Don’t scream!

244
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:41,066
Get off!

245
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,045
Don’t scream so loudly.

246
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,040
Go away, you pervert!

247
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,031
This is my home.

248
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:49,017
OK, I’ll go… don’t throw away my things.

249
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,099
I said you’d regret.

250
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:10,096
Did you crawled home from the back again?

251
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:14,053
No, I’m hungry after sleeping.
Give me some chicken wings.

252
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:16,053
Nothing!

253
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:18,053
You don’t have to shout at me.

254
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,077
Miss, what for you?

255
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:42,056
I’d like “Blow Job.”

256
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,030
Miss, it’s not drunk like this.

257
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:27,012
Thanks.

258
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:29,063
Terrific.

259
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,050
Give me “Sex on the Beach.”

260
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:32,066
Me too.

261
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:35,052
Hi.

262
00:24:35,064 --> 00:24:38,067
My name is Lau Tang.

263
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,025
My name is Chow, Ben Chow.

264
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:52,052
Oh, Ben Chow.

265
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:56,013
You can call me, umm, Mumble.

266
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,026
You drink a lot.

267
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:10,049
Can’t I? What about you?

268
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,002
Depends who drinks with me.

269
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:21,032
Then… drink at my place, OK?

270
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,067
Think it over.

271
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,030
I don’t have to think it over.

272
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:36,072
Don’t think I’m a casual man,
I just want a chat tonight.

273
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:41,078
My secret drink, “Flaming Blow Job.”

274
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:45,031
It’s a big glass, how do I drink it.

275
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:52,021
Ready, 1, 2, 3.

276
00:25:58,025 --> 00:25:59,020
Very tasty.

277
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:11,007
Got drunk with just one glass? What’s inside?

278
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,063
I put some gasoline in.

279
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:25,056
Don’t say I can’t bring here to senses, uncle Yee.

280
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:26,095
How do you raise your daughter?

281
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,098
You’ve spoilt Cher.

282
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:32,068
And you, you’re just a stupid uncle.

283
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:35,019
So many of you can’t talk to a girl, how come?

284
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:38,062
What’s going on? Did you ask
me to drink with your family?

285
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:42,095
You’re Mumble?

286
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:47,015
Listen, the girl at your place, that beauty.

287
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,037
Don’t touch her.

288
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:51,028
She’s daughter of Mr. Chiu
here, and also my cousin.

289
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:59,001
Mr. Chiu Sai Pak, I’ve seen you in the paper.

290
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:01,028
You look like father of Chow Wah Kien.

291
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,019
But sure you have lots of money.

292
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:07,052
The girl who snatched my place is your daughter?

293
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:10,048
She’s… quite good.

294
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:13,003
But she’s my fiancée!

295
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:18,033
You were an SDU member for two years.

296
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:21,062
You got fired! You’re useless indeed.

297
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:25,006
You must be up to something to enter SDU!

298
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:29,050
I was champion boxer in Harvard University last year.

299
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,094
Harvard University?

300
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:34,067
I was sweeping snow Harvard last year too.

301
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:37,098
All the guys who practised
kung-fu there couldn’t beat me.

302
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:39,098
Then let’s fight.

303
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:46,082
Do you want to fight or dance?

304
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,099
Small size clothes?
Took them from kids?

305
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:54,020
Mind your business.

306
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:12,079
Mr. Mumble, this boy is always talkative.

307
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:16,012
The reason why I ask Tang to take you here

308
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:18,056
is because I want you take Cher back here.

309
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:22,082
You’ve got lots of men, why don’t you find her yourself?

310
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:25,061
We sent some men.

311
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:29,036
They were kicked by some idiots out of the pub.

312
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:31,066
They should have ordered a drink.

313
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:33,056
You’ve got my birthday wrong.

314
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:36,042
Hey, you’ll get paid.

315
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:39,019
I’ll pay you $300,000 to bring her back.

316
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:41,049
But you mustn’t bully her.

317
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,058
Got it? It’s troublesome to chop you into pieces, you’re too big.

318
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:51,013
So little money? I must think it over.

319
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,056
No need to think.

320
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:55,035
You’ve just been fired from SDU.

321
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:57,061
The money is enough for living.

322
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:58,078
Oh!

323
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:00,088
I’m sorry.

324
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,066
Can I have another fork?

325
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:05,037
What are you sorry for?

326
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:08,008
I’ll pay you three million dollars if you make him hurt. It’s peg-leg.

327
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,023
Come on, take $300,000 deposit first.

328
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,002
Remember to shut the door.

329
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,002
Got it, I will.

330
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,086
Hallo. Wait a second.

331
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:09,072
Mr. Chan, your cousin wants you.

332
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:11,047
Fighting is interesting.

333
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,040
Cher, I knew you’d call me.

334
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,020
Why don’t you come home? It’s just a quarrel.

335
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:23,047
It’s bad, you know this makes me lose face.

336
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:25,045
Everyone knows we’re getting married soon.

337
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:30,007
Hey, will you stop it a while?

338
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:33,062
First thing, I’ve never promised to marry you.

339
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:35,084
You can’t just turn me down.

340
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,056
Your dad is my boss.

341
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:40,093
He’s for our marriage, just do as he wishes.

342
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:47,086
OK, after our wedding, I promise
I’ll let you do whatever you want.

343
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,040
Don’t think I’ll go and beg you.

344
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,084
You know I’ve been busy.

345
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:55,003
OK, I have an interview with a journalist at Taiwo Restaurant today.

346
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,074
You can come and make it clear,
I’ll wait for you.

347
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,007
We’ll have good days after marrying that bitch.

348
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:09,043
We can make a fortune when we’ll take up the shares of those two geezers.

349
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,043
Right, you have a point, Mr. Chan.

350
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:16,012
Who taught you such lousy words?

351
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,031
Good morning.

352
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:25,069
What are you doing? That’s horrible.

353
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:26,099
Some exercising.

354
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:29,019
It looks more like a pervert exercising.

355
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,045
Let me take you for breakfast.

356
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:34,063
Thanks, but I’d lose my appetite
if I’ll eat with you.

357
00:31:34,063 --> 00:31:35,077
Bye.

358
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:39,089
Mind your steps. Catch you later.

359
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:11,051
This is restricted area,
no cars stop here at this hour.

360
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,097
Let me drive you.

361
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:24,025
Please.

362
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,057
When the journalist arrives,
wait for me in the next room.

363
00:32:29,057 --> 00:32:30,058
Don’t scare him.

364
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:31,032
Yes, Sir.

365
00:32:35,028 --> 00:32:36,088
Mr. Chan, what would you like?

366
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,023
I eat anything.

367
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:43,085
What are you doing here?

368
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:47,047
I’m the journalist, I’ve come to make the interview with Mr. Chan.

369
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:50,034
Hands up, turn around.

370
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:53,022
Why? Why did you take the negatives out?

371
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:58,078
Get new one! Mr. Chan is over there.

372
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,032
Thanks.

373
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:04,027
Mr. Chan, I’m the journalist of What Magazine.

374
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:06,050
I’ve seen many reporters,

375
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,036
but you’re the most clumsy one.

376
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:10,036
You’d be an editor if you were smart.

377
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:14,029
But you’ll become one after the dinner. Sit down.

378
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,037
Thank you, Mr. Chan.

379
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,046
Why are you following me?
I’ve come to meet my cousin.

380
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:30,013
Meet your cousin? Good.

381
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:32,020
He’s a boss of Mafia.

382
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,057
Mafia is fine.

383
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:37,063
You must have seen too many Mafia films.

384
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,033
Money at hand after this task.

385
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:46,023
No, I must let her cousin know
I’ve brought her back.

386
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:50,085
Frankly speaking, I didn’t exaggerate in that.

387
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:55,081
Didn’t I say… I’m like a hero.

388
00:33:56,011 --> 00:33:58,088
There are no heroes,
what we count on is power.

389
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:01,071
Right.

390
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:04,066
I can tell you didn’t get pointed
at the head with two guns.

391
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:08,055
You only think what will happen in films?

392
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:11,097
I was really once got pointed at with two guns.

393
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:13,097
Where did that happen?

394
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:18,083
Holland.

395
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,006
Luckily, I reacted quickly enough.

396
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:25,016
I pointed at him with four guns,
and he wetted his trousers.

397
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:27,074
That’s why I’m never scared when
others point at me with guns.

398
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:33,036
What did he point at me with,
I must point at him, but not massage.

399
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:39,062
Shall I take you a photo?

400
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:45,028
I’ll leave now, thank you.

401
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:55,003
You’re not going to force me into marriage.

402
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:57,030
If you’ll marry me against my will, I’ll kill you.

403
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,061
Why don’t you say something?

404
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:03,042
You’ve killed Mr. Chan!

405
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,004
I didn’t do it.

406
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:08,003
My, my. This is no way for four
men to pick up a girl.

407
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,014
Still want to shoot? Put it down.

408
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:37,077
Let me! Help, Mumble!

409
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,065
You can do it now?
You couldn’t do that in the morning.

410
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,011
Well, fighting doesn’t need exercise.

411
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:52,096
Now cousin is dead, what shall I do?

412
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:55,078
Go have a tea, police will handle it.

413
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,073
My cousin died horribly.

414
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:07,076
Talk to me, so I don’t have
to keep thinking about him.

415
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:10,079
You kept saying you knew nothing on the police station.

416
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,081
How come you know nothing?

417
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:16,052
I really know nothing. You won’t understand.

418
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:19,054
Your cousin was killed in a public place, surrounded by his men.

419
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:21,005
That assassin must have been skilled.

420
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:23,093
Nerves of steel, so he wouldn’t give himself away.

421
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,022
Have you knocked on the door?

422
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:33,025
What are you doing here?

423
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,054
Do you know each other?

424
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:37,074
I’ve come to see how you are.

425
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:41,023
It’s going to happen you sooner or later.

426
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:44,036
Cousin was like you, a Mafia
member, now he was killed.

427
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,095
Do you want to end up like him?

428
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:48,022
You mustn’t talk to me like this, I’m your dad.

429
00:36:48,024 --> 00:36:49,022
Are you talking back?

430
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:52,008
OK, I’ll be quiet, if you don’t like it.

431
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:54,085
You’re a boss of Mafia, you’re the boss.

432
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:56,097
You’re my daughter, you must obey me.

433
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:03,073
What manner is this? I’m talking to you.

434
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:08,093
Are you hot? Go inside, it’s air-conditioned.

435
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,070
OK…

436
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:17,056
Mumble, sorry for arguing at your place.

437
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:19,069
It’s OK, just make yourself at home.

438
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:21,053
Make yourself at home!

439
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:22,076
Oh, right.

440
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,035
Here’s a cheque of $300,000.

441
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:31,078
Cher’s cousin paid me to
take Cher home, but I failed.

442
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:35,040
He’s dead now, and it can’t be cashed. So I’ll give it to you.

443
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,071
Don’t worry, all cheques signed by me can be cashed.

444
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:45,057
That bastard gave you $300,000?

445
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,037
Take this money.

446
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,084
Don’t take my daughter home for the moment.

447
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:51,070
Why?

448
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:53,030
Sit down first.

449
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,045
She can’t come home now.

450
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,012
I want you to protect her,
I must check Simon’s case.

451
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:08,001
You have lots of men, why do you want me to protect her?

452
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,099
You’re a good bodyguard,
even though you’re perverted.

453
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,095
Don’t try to touch her,
or I’ll have you castrated.

454
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:19,044
Don’t panic. Be gentleman and you’ll make it.

455
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:23,021
What do you think? Is it a deal?

456
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,025
Mumble, don’t disappoint me.

457
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:35,050
You’ve really made yourself at home.

458
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,069
Let’s go.

459
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,008
Get me an apple. Cher, I’m leaving.

460
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,001
You haven’t closed door.

461
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:59,078
I invited you to my place
before but you refused.

462
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:02,077
Now you’ve come here yourself?

463
00:39:02,077 --> 00:39:05,006
Mind your fingers.

464
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:08,013
What did Chiu Sai Pak talk to you just then?

465
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:12,039
Oh, so you’re investigating Chiu Sai Pak.

466
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:15,016
OK, what is about him?

467
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:18,015
He belongs to a Mafia.

468
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,061
I’m investigating him for a long time.

469
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:26,028
Simon was killed today.

470
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:30,021
Those men you beat at Taiwo
Restaurant were killed too.

471
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:31,081
Are you suspecting me?

472
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:33,044
No.

473
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:36,022
Would you keep an eye on him for me?

474
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:38,052
I will owe you one shot.

475
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:41,007
Hey, you owe me five shots,
you haven’t paid yet.

476
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:47,013
Don’t worry, I’ll pay you all at one time.

477
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:57,008
OK, I didn’t see anything, go on.

478
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:08,062
Hi.

479
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:20,078
Hey, you can’t just go out to disco, can you?

480
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:24,055
Listen, you’re so persistent, but you won’t get me.

481
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:27,024
Do you think I want to follow you?

482
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,010
It’s only my job. Your dad hired me as your bodyguard.

483
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:32,011
I hate father’s bodyguards.

484
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,046
One person.

485
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:40,064
Thank you. Bye.

486
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,072
Sir, you can’t go in.

487
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:45,042
Why?

488
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,034
This is not YY, this is QQ.

489
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:52,047
Oh, Ladies only, for $150?

490
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:54,021
I’ll pay you $100 extra.

491
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:32,095
So many girls? Great!

492
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:50,059
Hi.

493
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,006
I haven’t seen you here before.

494
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,044
It’s my first time here.

495
00:41:56,084 --> 00:42:00,047
No wonder! What will you drink?

496
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,082
Anything except “Flaming Blow Job.”

497
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:03,065
You’re charming.

498
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:07,008
You too, let me kiss you.

499
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:16,039
It’s OK, I love both ways.

500
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:24,019
You’re open minded, I like it.

501
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:29,077
Oh, you are…

502
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:31,077
Yeah, I am like you.

503
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:34,040
No, I don’t like men.

504
00:42:34,086 --> 00:42:35,076
Hey!

505
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,073
You look familiar.

506
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,039
Your coughing is familiar too.

507
00:42:57,087 --> 00:42:58,064
Ten.

508
00:42:58,064 --> 00:43:01,044
No, you know nothing but ten!

509
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:07,083
Ten…

510
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:15,041
Hey, no men are allowed here? Don’t you know?

511
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:19,085
I know, but I own this place.

512
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:23,039
You can’t run away, it’s my place.

513
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,075
OK, I’m gonna leave.

514
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,064
Stop smoking, you keep coughing.

515
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:33,007
Suit yourself.

516
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:55,073
What do you want? Leave me alone.

517
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:57,009
Wanna fight our boss?

518
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:01,063
Listen, get out of here at once!

519
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:02,030
What did you say?

520
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,057
If my dad learns this, he won’t let you off.

521
00:44:05,072 --> 00:44:09,003
Everyone knows you’re in bad terms with your father.

522
00:44:09,011 --> 00:44:11,069
Are you threatening me?
Do you know who I am?

523
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:12,076
You’re an octopus!

524
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:15,060
Bitch, dare you swear at me? I’m Little Chong.

525
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,042
So what? I’m Supergirl,
never heard about me?

526
00:44:32,095 --> 00:44:36,013
Help!

527
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:37,097
Will you try to pick on a tall woman?

528
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:42,095
Mumble, kill them!

529
00:44:42,095 --> 00:44:44,002
Who is this woman?

530
00:44:44,002 --> 00:44:45,029
I have never seen her, boss.

531
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,081
Faggot, I’ll sodomite you
if you won’t go away!

532
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:50,095
Do as you please.

533
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,095
You like this, too?

534
00:44:55,016 --> 00:44:56,001
Kill him!

535
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,049
You think we’re some tribesmen?

536
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:07,028
Throw all at once!

537
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:09,031
Take them.

538
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,037
Good, we can return them in supermarket.

539
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,048
Nothing more?

540
00:45:48,084 --> 00:45:50,012
It’s our turn now.

541
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:04,088
Let me take a look, it’s all right, no bleeding.

542
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:07,015
It’s OK, stop crying.

543
00:49:29,037 --> 00:49:31,033
Why did you take me here
first thing in the morning?

544
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:32,091
We didn’t come here to drink anyway.

545
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:36,037
Come on.

546
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:48,041
Why did you come here?

547
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:50,064
Well, I came to see the kids.

548
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:52,047
When will your boss arrive?

549
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:53,061
Very soon.

550
00:49:53,088 --> 00:49:55,061
Boss, Cher is here.

551
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,033
No!

552
00:50:00,094 --> 00:50:02,081
Principal, go get ready.

553
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,038
Yes.

554
00:50:04,005 --> 00:50:05,072
I run this orphanage.

555
00:50:05,072 --> 00:50:07,034
It’s a surprise from me.

556
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:09,011
You all lie to me?

557
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:11,006
Yachi, what are you doing here?

558
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,055
What’s going on here so early in the morning?

559
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,022
I’m your assistant.

560
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:24,068
Why don’t you talk to your father? Speak to him.

561
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:29,078
Dad, why won’t you tell me anything?

562
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,014
I didn’t have a chance to talk to you.

563
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:39,005
You’re right, I should retire now.

564
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:41,005
Will you retire?

565
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:44,001
Yeah, boss does listen to you.

566
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:46,041
But you’re alike, you are both stubborn.

567
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:48,067
I’ve set up a charity fund.

568
00:50:48,097 --> 00:50:51,030
I’ll announce it in a banquet next week.

569
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,081
I won’t be in this business anymore.

570
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:58,014
Will you smile finally?

571
00:50:58,064 --> 00:51:00,029
You never smile at me.

572
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:07,038
Dad, I’m sorry.

573
00:51:08,054 --> 00:51:10,010
I keep losing temper to you.

574
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:16,007
It’s good you know,
let’s not lose temper again.

575
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:22,081
My dream girl!

576
00:51:40,082 --> 00:51:44,029
You two look alike, are you twins?

577
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:53,093
Kid, how old are you?

578
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:30,032
Fire!

579
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:33,094
Stay calm.

580
00:52:40,096 --> 00:52:43,054
After him!

581
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:46,082
Wait!

582
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,034
Let him be.

583
00:52:54,081 --> 00:52:57,080
I know who was that man, he killed cousin.

584
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:00,079
I’ve found out that Dragon Club
sent an assassin to kill Simon.

585
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,040
I’ll send our men to handle them.

586
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:05,092
No, let police to do it.

587
00:53:05,092 --> 00:53:08,087
Father is right, we mustn’t
get involved in this anymore.

588
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:11,010
Right.

589
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:12,040
Why don’t you chase him?

590
00:53:12,092 --> 00:53:15,075
What about you? You’re police.

591
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:20,030
That assassin failed to kill them both.

592
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:22,053
He won’t just let it be.

593
00:53:22,053 --> 00:53:24,019
He’ll be after me now, too.

594
00:53:27,005 --> 00:53:29,030
Wake up, jog with me.

595
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:31,040
It’s safer at home.

596
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
Killers don’t get up so early.

597
00:53:38,002 --> 00:53:41,086
Hey! Faster! Are you awake? Poor you.

598
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:46,032
Be sharp! Come on, run, faster!

599
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,062
I can run as fast as you can.

600
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:52,024
Let’s contest.

601
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:54,062
One, two…

602
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:04,057
You’re so slow, run faster.

603
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:13,082
Not bad.

604
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:22,047
You’re fooling around.

605
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:56,079
Mumble, help! Mumble!

606
00:55:03,058 --> 00:55:05,081
Just in time. Go.

607
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:17,022
Open the door! Let me go, open the door!

608
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:21,011
Mumble can’t protect you anymore, we’ll protect you.

609
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:24,040
I hate you!

610
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:30,091
Faster.

611
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:32,082
It’s fine.

612
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:49,036
Hey, can you drive?

613
00:55:49,036 --> 00:55:51,010
I’m used to sitting on the other side.

614
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:22,086
This door won’t open, what should I do?

615
00:56:22,086 --> 00:56:24,027
This door won’t open either.

616
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:27,008
Don’t press on me.

617
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,096
Don’t move.

618
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:05,090
What can I say?

619
00:59:01,025 --> 00:59:02,065
Did you have to kidnap this?

620
00:59:24,089 --> 00:59:26,022
Mumble!

621
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:12,089
What’s going on?

622
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:24,038
Why are you after me?

623
01:00:27,094 --> 01:00:29,045
Leave the girl and get out.

624
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:39,047
Don’t shoot!

625
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:47,001
I didn’t see anything.
I didn’t see you killing.

626
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:51,034
What do you want?

627
01:00:51,091 --> 01:00:55,060
I’m waiting for someone.
I’ll kill you when he comes.

628
01:00:56,003 --> 01:00:57,007
He’s waiting for me.

629
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:01,070
Mumble!

630
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:04,051
Now you’re going to die.

631
01:01:05,059 --> 01:01:08,025
This is dead end, you have nowhere to run.

632
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:13,047
Yes, I’m waiting for you.

633
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:16,089
I want to have a duel with you
without anyone disturbing us.

634
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:21,039
Why do you want to fight?
You’re going to lose.

635
01:01:21,072 --> 01:01:23,095
If you hadn’t run away last time,
you’d have been killed.

636
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:26,082
I wonder if someone sent you to kill Cher.

637
01:01:27,014 --> 01:01:29,052
Last time, you weren’t alone,
that’s why I ran away.

638
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:32,077
She’s just unlucky that I have to kill her.

639
01:01:33,082 --> 01:01:35,064
Because she saw me killing Simon.

640
01:01:36,073 --> 01:01:41,010
OK, let go of Cher, and I won’t tell others you’re that lousy.

641
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,077
You won’t tell anyone if I kill you.

642
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:47,060
What? Then I’d better stay away from you.

643
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:50,033
To be precise, is this position OK?

644
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:51,047
You’re asking for it.

645
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,049
This way.

646
01:02:01,025 --> 01:02:02,036
My turn now.

647
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,081
I said you would die.

648
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:10,072
A sniper needs only one shot.

649
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,047
A master needs only one bullet.

650
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:25,051
Don’t be scared, he can’t kill anymore.

651
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,077
Really? I want you to hug me.

652
01:02:30,054 --> 01:02:31,038
Bastard!

653
01:02:44,092 --> 01:02:46,005
What happened?

654
01:02:46,048 --> 01:02:47,040
Show yourself!

655
01:02:48,046 --> 01:02:50,011
I know you want to kill me.

656
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:55,029
I didn’t want him to kill you, because you’re mine.

657
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:56,064
Why do you want to kill me?

658
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,013
Because you killed Shek Chung.

659
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:00,098
You’re Shek Chung’s daughter?

660
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,011
Why did you kill my father?

661
01:03:03,036 --> 01:03:05,040
Mumble didn’t kill him.

662
01:03:06,094 --> 01:03:09,033
His death had nothing to do with Mumble.

663
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:12,003
Mumble just wanted to help him.

664
01:03:12,003 --> 01:03:13,008
Monster!

665
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,059
Speak.

666
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:18,040
Years ago, Shek Chung used
to be a sniper in police force.

667
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:20,049
It was him who taught
Mumble shooting skills.

668
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:23,044
In order to get money for your brain operation,

669
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:25,027
he got bribed by Fook Ying Gang.

670
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:27,016
At last, are you coming to arrest me?

671
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:31,024
I was wrong.

672
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:34,025
Just as Mumble and Shek Chung were talking,

673
01:03:34,025 --> 01:03:36,057
Shek Chung decided to commit
suicide — he cut his wrist.

674
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:40,023
When Mumble saw that
Shek Chung was bleeding badly…

675
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:42,018
What are you doing?

676
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,064
If a good sniper can’t use a gun a again,

677
01:03:49,014 --> 01:03:50,049
then he might as well be dead.

678
01:03:51,003 --> 01:03:52,045
Why do you want to kill yourself?

679
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:55,043
Have you thought of your daughter?

680
01:03:56,094 --> 01:03:58,084
It’s for the sake of my daughter.

681
01:03:59,037 --> 01:04:02,064
If I commit suicide, insurance company won’t pay.

682
01:04:03,092 --> 01:04:05,079
Please, hold this gun.

683
01:04:06,028 --> 01:04:08,007
And tell them I resisted to be arrested.

684
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:13,072
Why?!

685
01:04:16,098 --> 01:04:20,000
He was just corrupted, you didn’t have to kill him.

686
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,076
He was your teacher.

687
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:27,013
His blood stained Mumble’s clothes.

688
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:29,098
That’s why Mumble always wears the red shirt, in memory of Shek Chung.

689
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:34,086
And the blue jacket to cheer
himself up, like the blue sky.

690
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,049
What about the black trousers?

691
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:38,049
Black trousers won’t get dirty easily.

692
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:41,050
Monster, you’re bastard!

693
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,064
You should believe Mumble.

694
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:50,017
I do, I’ve tried to kill him six times, and he’s wearing this every time.

695
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:56,003
Please, mind the door.

696
01:04:58,067 --> 01:04:59,065
Wai Heung.

697
01:05:04,036 --> 01:05:06,061
Mumble, you’re great.

698
01:05:08,085 --> 01:05:11,088
The killer is dead, you don’t need my company. I’ll see you home.

699
01:05:11,088 --> 01:05:15,039
No way. You must go to the
banquet with me tonight.

700
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:43,076
Sir.

701
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:46,094
Thanks.

702
01:05:52,037 --> 01:05:53,075
How do you do?

703
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,038
This is Mr. Leung.

704
01:05:56,038 --> 01:05:57,046
How do you do?

705
01:05:57,046 --> 01:05:58,063
How do you do?

706
01:06:00,029 --> 01:06:01,001
Nice to meet you.

707
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:02,025
Sorry, Mr. Leung.

708
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:03,065
Dad, Mumble has arrived.

709
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:14,030
You mustn’t behave like a pervert.

710
01:06:14,061 --> 01:06:15,090
You’re beautiful.

711
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:19,003
Do you wear something different today?

712
01:06:19,003 --> 01:06:21,027
What’s wrong? Does it suit me?

713
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:26,068
$380 for a day.

714
01:06:28,011 --> 01:06:29,033
Put it away.

715
01:06:30,035 --> 01:06:31,075
I’ve rented it from Jordan Road.

716
01:06:31,075 --> 01:06:32,091
It’s reasonable.

717
01:06:33,003 --> 01:06:35,010
Cheaper than orange juice.

718
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,060
You don’t need to pay tips.

719
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:37,067
Excuse me.

720
01:06:39,043 --> 01:06:42,042
Cher, do you remember my son?

721
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:44,042
No, I don’t.

722
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,072
It’s John.

723
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:48,035
You used to play together.

724
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:49,034
Did we?

725
01:06:50,014 --> 01:06:53,025
He’s just graduated from UCLA,
medical college.

726
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:54,035
He’s smart.

727
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:57,020
John, talk with Cher.

728
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,019
How are you?

729
01:06:57,026 --> 01:06:59,005
Dear guests.

730
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,093
Shake hands.

731
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:05,035
Welcome to the ceremony of setting up Cher’s Charity Fund.

732
01:07:05,035 --> 01:07:07,065
Please, be seated.

733
01:07:07,004 --> 01:07:08,017
Cher, we…

734
01:07:08,017 --> 01:07:10,085
Please, take a seat.

735
01:07:10,095 --> 01:07:13,096
Excuse me, I have to go to my Dad.

736
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:14,099
All right.

737
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:16,037
Wait for me.

738
01:07:17,068 --> 01:07:21,044
First, I must explain you the reason of setting up this fund.

739
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:26,092
We aim to help the poor orphans and children without care.

740
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:34,048
We must thank Mr. Chiu Sai Pak
who donated $750,000,000.

741
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:36,028
Please applaud.

742
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:46,009
Ladies and gentlemen, please help yourself to dinner.

743
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:43,063
I don’t need you.

744
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,056
What are you looking for?

745
01:07:48,058 --> 01:07:50,047
Nothing.

746
01:07:50,057 --> 01:07:53,080
Thank you very much for coming.

747
01:08:07,093 --> 01:08:08,064
What are you laughing.

748
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:10,045
Nothing, eat on.

749
01:08:12,082 --> 01:08:14,074
Cheers.

750
01:08:17,017 --> 01:08:18,067
Well done!

751
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:30,016
Well I never! I could be your mother, and you’re still so perverted?

752
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:43,062
Sir, you look strong. Can you help me open it?

753
01:08:43,092 --> 01:08:45,019
No problem.

754
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,029
Mum, are you all right?

755
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:11,033
Dad, I’ll go over, help yourself.

756
01:09:08,098 --> 01:09:11,088
Don’t scare me, help her to take a rest inside.

757
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:15,059
You didn’t have to beat my mum,
just because she turned you down.

758
01:09:32,025 --> 01:09:33,077
Is the girl coming for me?

759
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,076
Can I have the first dance with you?

760
01:09:38,071 --> 01:09:40,081
I’ve just hurt someone, it’s not too good.

761
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:42,098
No worries, her son is a doctor.

762
01:09:43,065 --> 01:09:45,035
You’re right.

763
01:09:45,035 --> 01:09:47,006
Oh, lucky man.

764
01:11:03,035 --> 01:11:05,074
Cher, you are really beautiful tonight.

765
01:11:07,018 --> 01:11:09,095
You should have the first dance with your dad.

766
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:12,051
It’s OK, he’ll understand.

767
01:11:14,063 --> 01:11:19,095
I don’t know why, but I’m starting to have feelings for you.

768
01:11:20,088 --> 01:11:22,003
It’s all right.

769
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,084
Do you love me, too?

770
01:11:25,054 --> 01:11:26,040
Yeah.

771
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,068
Are you serious?

772
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:39,089
Miss, Mr. Chiu asked for you to cut the cake.

773
01:11:40,018 --> 01:11:41,047
All right, go inside.

774
01:11:41,049 --> 01:11:42,008
Yes.

775
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:47,051
Go cut the cake. I’ll come in a while.
Let me think it over.

776
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:49,051
Hurry up.

777
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:50,024
Sure.

778
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:00,072
If you want, just tell…

779
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:16,082
Cher, I’ve retired, just as you asked me.

780
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,033
Why are you still upset?

781
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:20,038
No, I’m very happy today.

782
01:12:20,038 --> 01:12:21,095
It’s because of Mumble.

783
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:23,049
No.

784
01:12:23,097 --> 01:12:25,057
You can’t lie to me.

785
01:12:26,028 --> 01:12:28,017
Really? You’re so clever.

786
01:12:34,072 --> 01:12:35,069
Go back!

787
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:57,003
Protect my daughter.

788
01:12:57,046 --> 01:12:58,076
Yes, sir.

789
01:13:14,046 --> 01:13:15,058
Who are they?

790
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:16,046
I don’t know.

791
01:13:23,017 --> 01:13:24,053
Take my daughter away.

792
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:26,053
We don’t stand a chance against them, sorry.

793
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,039
Don’t shoot, we surrender.

794
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:30,049
Fire.

795
01:13:43,071 --> 01:13:45,052
Run if there’s an opening.

796
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:47,028
No, we must run together.

797
01:14:10,015 --> 01:14:11,078
Cher, get off and run!

798
01:14:23,047 --> 01:14:24,069
Dad, run!

799
01:14:28,054 --> 01:14:29,043
Dad…

800
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:32,070
I’ll protect you.

801
01:14:55,036 --> 01:14:56,054
Fall back.

802
01:14:57,007 --> 01:14:58,097
Your dad got shot, and is bleeding.

803
01:14:58,097 --> 01:15:00,047
I’m not going to stop his bleeding.

804
01:15:00,047 --> 01:15:03,083
With his weight, he’ll die in three hours.

805
01:15:03,091 --> 01:15:05,042
Don’t try to call police.

806
01:15:05,066 --> 01:15:08,057
He’ll die in ten minutes if I’ll shoot him again.

807
01:15:08,058 --> 01:15:10,072
So you’re the boss behind the scene?

808
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:13,043
Don’t try to harm him anymore!

809
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,044
OK, where do you want me to go?

810
01:15:21,093 --> 01:15:23,081
You just want money.

811
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:26,033
You didn’t need to send so many guys just for us.

812
01:15:26,085 --> 01:15:28,033
Why are you doing this?

813
01:15:29,044 --> 01:15:30,062
Just for revenge.

814
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:33,068
I’ve fought so hard for you.

815
01:15:34,013 --> 01:15:36,087
My legs are crippled, but I never blamed you.

816
01:15:37,092 --> 01:15:40,003
Your nephew was getting married with your daughter.

817
01:15:40,043 --> 01:15:42,078
Did you think that bastard loved her?

818
01:15:43,035 --> 01:15:45,010
He just wanted your shares.

819
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:47,087
So I sent the assassin to kill him.

820
01:15:49,018 --> 01:15:51,022
I’m doing all of this for your good sake.

821
01:15:51,022 --> 01:15:52,089
Did you kill him?

822
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:55,004
Then you tried to kill Cher for my good sake too?

823
01:15:55,004 --> 01:15:57,093
No, I never wanted to kill her.

824
01:15:58,034 --> 01:16:01,061
She happened to see the assassin,
so he had to kill her.

825
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:03,006
You’ve done so many evil things,

826
01:16:03,006 --> 01:16:04,039
and you’re still making excuses?

827
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:05,065
You’re mad!

828
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:08,044
I’ve done evil things?

829
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:12,042
You’ve been the one who was smuggling, remember that please.

830
01:16:12,095 --> 01:16:15,014
You can never become a charitable person.

831
01:16:15,016 --> 01:16:16,010
You’re mad.

832
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,057
Well, I can be mad.

833
01:16:17,057 --> 01:16:18,093
But why did you bring me here?

834
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:23,033
I don’t want to see you throwing money out.

835
01:16:24,016 --> 01:16:27,041
I want you to give all your properties to me.

836
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:34,048
OK, I’ll give them all to you, but you have to give me a pen!

837
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:01,041
Are you satisfied now?

838
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,070
Mr. Chiu, even though you’ve signed,

839
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:06,093
all your properties are jointly owned by you and your daughter.

840
01:17:06,093 --> 01:17:08,077
Now, we need your daughter.

841
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,080
You bastard!

842
01:17:14,066 --> 01:17:16,033
You don’t have to call for Cher.

843
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:18,063
My signature is valid on everything.

844
01:18:22,005 --> 01:18:23,073
I’ve called Cher.

845
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,068
But she’s with Mumble now.

846
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,030
I’m afraid he’ll come with her.

847
01:18:29,099 --> 01:18:31,097
He was once my man.

848
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:34,069
I have nine others here.

849
01:18:35,068 --> 01:18:37,015
I can handle him easily.

850
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:38,078
All right then.

851
01:18:39,023 --> 01:18:41,021
I’m just asking you to deal only with him.

852
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:47,061
It’s dangerous for them to deal with Mumble, too.

853
01:18:48,011 --> 01:18:50,080
But they might disappear after this incident.

854
01:18:51,004 --> 01:18:52,088
So we must get reasonable money.

855
01:19:00,092 --> 01:19:02,054
Do you want to raise your reward?

856
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:06,057
You’ll get too much money.

857
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:11,087
You’ll get $5 billion, I just want 10%.

858
01:19:12,034 --> 01:19:14,088
Pay me now if you agree.

859
01:19:20,099 --> 01:19:23,093
Money is not important, we must cooperate.

860
01:19:30,023 --> 01:19:31,068
OK, boys.

861
01:19:31,068 --> 01:19:33,084
I’m repeating, this is not a drill. Come on.

862
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,076
I’m repeating, this is not a drill.

863
01:19:38,019 --> 01:19:41,008
You know your positions, you know what to do.

864
01:19:41,045 --> 01:19:44,096
Kill that pervert, kill him on sight. Understand?

865
01:19:45,003 --> 01:19:46,019
Yes, sir!

866
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:47,014
Go!

867
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:06,092
Number 1, the girl has just arrived.

868
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:11,054
Number 2, what do you see?

869
01:20:11,096 --> 01:20:14,013
Number 2, that girl has just walked past.

870
01:20:14,096 --> 01:20:17,048
Number 3, lock the door.

871
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,050
Dad!

872
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:31,010
Dad, does it hurt?

873
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:34,085
No, but why did you come here?

874
01:20:35,016 --> 01:20:36,086
They dare not harm me.

875
01:20:38,019 --> 01:20:39,097
You’re cruel!

876
01:20:40,066 --> 01:20:43,052
Sign it and you can go home with your father.

877
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:45,052
Don’t do it.

878
01:20:45,076 --> 01:20:48,022
Dad, money is not important.

879
01:20:48,049 --> 01:20:50,067
I just want to live a peaceful life with you.

880
01:20:54,034 --> 01:20:55,014
Go away.

881
01:20:56,029 --> 01:20:59,021
I hope you let Cher go after she’ll have signed it.

882
01:21:01,062 --> 01:21:05,011
Dad, bear it, we will go home soon.

883
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:08,033
I’ve spotted Mumble.

884
01:21:09,055 --> 01:21:10,094
Kill him! Now!

885
01:21:17,013 --> 01:21:18,060
I’ve thought it over.

886
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,095
I wanted to split up our ways in a peace.

887
01:21:22,034 --> 01:21:25,016
But I think it’s not a good idea.

888
01:21:34,072 --> 01:21:36,010
Are you turning against me?

889
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,062
Mr. Chiu, sorry.

890
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,030
Driver Siu Ming?

891
01:21:41,025 --> 01:21:43,021
Mumble, where are you?

892
01:21:54,055 --> 01:21:57,048
Mumble wants to play with us.
Don’t disappoint him. Move!

893
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,081
Kill Mumble when you’ll see him.

894
01:22:05,097 --> 01:22:06,069
Yes, sir!

895
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,076
It hurts…

896
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:16,072
Dad, bear it. It will be all right.
We’ll get home soon.

897
01:22:16,072 --> 01:22:18,087
No, I can’t walk anymore.

898
01:22:19,058 --> 01:22:20,067
Shoot if you see anyone.

899
01:22:27,078 --> 01:22:29,053
Mumble, go ahead.

900
01:22:29,053 --> 01:22:31,073
I’ll stay here and shoot whoever I see.

901
01:22:35,008 --> 01:22:37,086
Dad, let us kill that bastard.

902
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:41,062
Are you still fooling around
at this critical moment?

903
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:44,051
If you want to live, you should help me.

904
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:46,022
What is it?

905
01:24:16,064 --> 01:24:18,091
Mumble!

906
01:24:22,002 --> 01:24:23,021
They have escaped from the black hole.

907
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:25,048
We’ll be right there, they can’t get away.

908
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:31,068
Why do you wear the sunglasses
in such darkness?

909
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:45,030
Watch out!

910
01:24:49,013 --> 01:24:50,012
Run, quick!

911
01:24:59,025 --> 01:25:00,099
Eddie, we’re moving to the position 2!

912
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:04,054
What’s that thing on your arm?

913
01:25:04,054 --> 01:25:07,001
It’s a .44 Magnum, modified.

914
01:25:07,033 --> 01:25:10,010
Without the metal support,
the recoil can break your arm.

915
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,025
Watch out!

916
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,046
– Hide yourself.
– Dad, quickly get down.

917
01:25:34,068 --> 01:25:35,085
You’ve got still one more gun.

918
01:25:38,045 --> 01:25:40,037
Eddie, why?

919
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:01,062
Dad, calm down, you’ll hit Mumble.

920
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:27,070
Have you fooled around long enough?

921
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:37,007
Call Officer Chi.

922
01:26:37,007 --> 01:26:40,015
Yes. Reporting, we’ve caught Mumble.

923
01:26:40,024 --> 01:26:41,037
Kill him now!

924
01:27:01,074 --> 01:27:03,001
Eddie, are you all right?

925
01:27:04,081 --> 01:27:06,026
Come, this is the exit.

926
01:27:13,032 --> 01:27:14,008
Fuck!

927
01:27:16,001 --> 01:27:18,071
Get in the position 1 to block Mumble. Quickly!

928
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:26,088
It’s locked, what should we do?

929
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:29,003
Mumble, stay away.

930
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:34,079
Doesn’t work.
Do you think we’re in a film?

931
01:27:37,006 --> 01:27:38,061
Do you think this is a TV show?

932
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,067
OK, doesn’t work.

933
01:28:12,067 --> 01:28:13,068
Let’s kill them.

934
01:28:51,029 --> 01:28:53,081
What’s the matter?
What’s going on there?

935
01:28:54,045 --> 01:28:55,041
Even a bullet-proof vest is useless.

936
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,018
What?

937
01:29:02,051 --> 01:29:04,034
Our Father who art in heaven,

938
01:29:04,034 --> 01:29:06,014
hallowed be thy name.

939
01:29:06,015 --> 01:29:07,083
Thy kingdom come.

940
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:11,038
Thy will be done on earth as it is in 1997.

941
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:13,049
Giving up so soon?

942
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:20,055
Oh my God!

943
01:29:48,074 --> 01:29:50,047
Jesus Christ!

944
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:52,058
Holy shit!

945
01:29:54,074 --> 01:29:58,099
Damn you, Mumble! I’m gonna kill you!

946
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,045
Monster, take them away first.

947
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:03,055
Mumble!

948
01:30:18,007 --> 01:30:21,063
Officer Chi, you have disgraced your family,

949
01:30:21,063 --> 01:30:24,093
the Royal Hong Kong Police and the special unit.

950
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,039
Shut up!

951
01:30:26,058 --> 01:30:28,015
No, you shut up.

952
01:30:28,065 --> 01:30:31,000
Officer Chi, the gig is over.

953
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,045
Where do you think you can run away?

954
01:30:32,085 --> 01:30:34,020
I can go everywhere.

955
01:30:35,026 --> 01:30:37,055
I must remember to thank you for killing them.

956
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:39,088
The money belongs only to me now.

957
01:30:40,045 --> 01:30:42,036
If you want, I can give you a share.

958
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,056
Fine, let’s get the money from an ATM now.

959
01:30:44,089 --> 01:30:48,061
Fuck it! You’re just talking bullshits!

960
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:53,074
Your .44 Magnum is modified.

961
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:57,056
You can’t shoot without the metal support attached to your arm.

962
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,041
Maybe not.

963
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:05,098
Just be careful not to shoot the other two by mistake.

964
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:08,032
Mumble, another special mission again?

965
01:31:08,032 --> 01:31:12,025
Got it, it’s another drill again.
I know what to do.

966
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:13,046
Hi.

967
01:31:13,046 --> 01:31:15,049
That really hurts.

968
01:31:17,047 --> 01:31:21,073
I’ve found out they’re Yee’s accomplices,
but wouldn’t expect to be kidnapped here.

969
01:31:21,073 --> 01:31:22,076
Mumble.

970
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:24,009
Why did you come back?

971
01:31:24,009 --> 01:31:26,049
I took Mr. Chiu away,
but Cher has disappeared.

972
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,011
Cher is over there.

973
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:31,001
Dad, Mumble.

974
01:31:31,067 --> 01:31:32,059
Don’t come over.

975
01:31:32,059 --> 01:31:33,073
Let Cher go now!

976
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:36,086
Since you’re all here, I can
get rid of all of you at once.

977
01:31:39,086 --> 01:31:42,048
Mumble, put the gun down.

978
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:45,077
If you’ll keep making problems,
I’m going to kill her.

979
01:31:47,016 --> 01:31:50,052
Hey, it’s fun to make threats,
I’d like to play the criminal part, too.

980
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:51,056
Monster.

981
01:31:55,061 --> 01:31:58,041
Huh, you’re using a human instead of gun support.

982
01:31:58,041 --> 01:31:59,076
Aim, one, two, three.

983
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:12,032
Well deserved.

984
01:32:14,043 --> 01:32:16,052
Mum… Mumble.

985
01:32:21,064 --> 01:32:22,057
What are you doing?

986
01:32:22,057 --> 01:32:24,067
Don’t move, or I’ll kill her.

987
01:32:25,008 --> 01:32:27,046
Let her go now, and I won’t chase you.

988
01:32:27,046 --> 01:32:28,038
Let her go!

989
01:32:28,064 --> 01:32:29,053
Nonsense!

990
01:32:29,081 --> 01:32:32,069
Cher, I hope you remember…

991
01:32:32,069 --> 01:32:35,027
we had a “good time” at the Peak.

992
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:40,007
Don’t move.

993
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,037
Don’t come over, or I’ll kill him.

994
01:32:46,035 --> 01:32:47,072
Still don’t have enough?

995
01:32:58,057 --> 01:32:59,058
Is the drill over?

996
01:32:59,092 --> 01:33:00,096
Yes, it’s over.

997
01:33:00,096 --> 01:33:02,029
It was like a real thing.

998
01:33:03,035 --> 01:33:05,095
You’ll get promoted by three ranks,
no need to quit drinking coffee.

999
01:33:05,095 --> 01:33:07,043
I have already quit drinking coffee.

1000
01:33:07,043 --> 01:33:10,010
I’ll treat you to coffee
if you get promoted.

1001
01:33:14,077 --> 01:33:18,025
Mumble, I want to thank you.

1002
01:34:25,099 --> 01:34:28,009
Your skills with gun are amazing.

1003
01:34:33,072 --> 01:34:35,020
You are always day-dreaming.

1004
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,033
I don’t know if you can be serious.

1005
01:34:37,033 --> 01:34:39,028
but I really don’t mind it.

1006
01:34:39,062 --> 01:34:42,006
Think it over carefully, don’t act impulsively.

1007
01:34:42,066 --> 01:34:44,066
Just pay me back for rescuing you and your father.

1008
01:34:45,049 --> 01:34:48,063
I’ve already thought it over, I won’t regret it.

1009
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:50,035
Today, you appear grown-up…

1010
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:54,042
No, you are really grown-up and mature.

1011
01:34:54,066 --> 01:34:56,070
You’re not the girl I met in the café.

1012
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:58,031
I didn’t like that girl.

1013
01:34:58,073 --> 01:35:00,074
But now, I…

1014
01:35:03,042 --> 01:35:06,007
I’m over 18, you don’t need to worry.

1015
01:35:15,032 --> 01:35:16,091
I have to think about it.

1016
01:35:19,019 --> 01:35:20,073
I really have to think about it some more.

1017
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:45,061
Dear Mumble.

1018
01:35:45,087 --> 01:35:47,093
You’ve done so much for me,

1019
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:51,098
but all I can do is just thank you.

1020
01:35:52,035 --> 01:35:54,029
I will cherish this relation with my father.

1021
01:35:55,068 --> 01:35:58,027
I might never meet you again,

1022
01:35:59,047 --> 01:36:03,020
but I will miss the happy days we spent together.

1023
01:36:03,069 --> 01:36:05,069
You have decided to live without me.

1024
01:36:06,008 --> 01:36:07,069
I respect your decision.

1025
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,042
I’m studying music with Dad at Harvard.

1026
01:36:11,029 --> 01:36:13,038
He studies music seriously.

1027
01:36:13,091 --> 01:36:16,056
I hope you get whatever you wish for.

1028
01:36:17,068 --> 01:36:20,090
Mumble Private Detective Agency is open, come.

1029
01:36:25,008 --> 01:36:26,015
10% discount for adultery cases.

1030
01:36:27,098 --> 01:36:29,044
Is that a joke?

1031
01:36:50,072 --> 01:36:53,051
Wow, did you dress so sexy
for taking the subway?

1032
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:57,053
If I’m not dressed sexy,
how can I catch perverts?

1033
01:36:57,099 --> 01:36:59,032
Mission Possible?

1034
01:36:59,032 --> 01:37:03,090
Yeah, Mission Possible. I caught some
on the way from Central to Tsun Wan.

1035
01:37:05,037 --> 01:37:06,005
Come on.

1036
01:37:08,024 --> 01:37:09,029
Go, go.

1037
01:37:09,054 --> 01:37:10,046
Hurry up!

1038
01:37:11,098 --> 01:37:15,059
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, King.

1039
01:37:16,012 --> 01:37:19,010
Great, exactly the same number
of times you owe me.

1040
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:21,044
You’re not catching perverts,
you’re seducing them.

1041
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:43,087
Hey, is it really you?

1042
01:37:44,006 --> 01:37:46,005
I almost couldn’t recognise
you with those glasses.

1043
01:37:46,005 --> 01:37:47,038
I couldn’t get another pair like that type,

1044
01:37:47,038 --> 01:37:48,084
so I’m wearing my mum’s.

1045
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:50,014
New car?

1046
01:37:50,048 --> 01:37:53,027
No, I crashed your car last time,
so this one is to repay you back.

1047
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:54,085
Good friend.

1048
01:37:57,029 --> 01:37:59,054
I’ve paid only $5,000 for the first instalment,

1049
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:02,035
you’ll have to pay $4,500
a month for the next 4 years.

1050
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,023
Old Chiu paid me $300,000 to open my agency.

1051
01:38:07,042 --> 01:38:08,044
It’s like a bad dream.

1052
01:38:08,044 --> 01:38:09,085
You can economize.

1053
01:38:10,025 --> 01:38:12,057
There is… my dream girl!

1054
01:38:16,035 --> 01:38:17,057
Wait for me, beautiful girl.

1055
01:38:18,069 --> 01:38:20,058
Hi.

1056
01:38:27,093 --> 01:38:30,050
Fucking gay, don’t follow me, or I’ll kill you!

1057
01:38:55,046 --> 01:38:56,056
Oh, Wai Heung.

1058
01:38:57,016 --> 01:38:58,060
Mumble!

1059
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,053
What is it?

1060
01:39:07,092 --> 01:39:09,042
Hey, still trying to run away?

1061
01:39:09,042 --> 01:39:11,090
Damn you, pervert. Come!
