1
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,133
Hey! I found something cool!

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
Come and see! Hey!

3
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,466
What's he so happy about now?

4
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,600
Sorry to keep you waiting, Nami-san~!

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,433
Then, If I may...

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,067
Oh~! Nami-san! Your skin is so smooth~!

7
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:38,800
Your hand slips even
once and I kill you, okay?

8
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,733
Man, this is one great vacation!

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,816
That's fine, but just remember that
we've got bounties on our heads.

10
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:51,332
Hey everyone, come look! It's really cool!

11
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,532
But aren't you the one
relaxing most, Miss Nami?

12
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:56,166
Hey! Heey! Come look! It's the Going Merry!

13
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,199
It's okay for now. We re
not in any hurry to get going.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,666
I agree with Nami-san!

15
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:03,666
Our ship is really somethin'.

16
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,000
What're you talking about, Luffy...

17
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,867
GOING MERRY!!

18
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,999
Our pirate mark is so cool!

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,999
You moron! How can you be so calm!?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,532
Our ship just got stolen!

21
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,932
WHAT? STOLEN!?

22
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,199
YOU DIMWIT!!

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Hold it, thief!!

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,999
The Going Merry is the soul I got from Kaya!

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,267
Being robbed by a fellow
thief? This is a joke, right?

26
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,267
GIVE IT BACK!!

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,067
THE CLOCKWORK ISLAND ADVENTURE

28
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,267
It's been a whole week
since it was stolen...

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,966
But you know, couldn't we
have found a better ship?

30
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,199
Not to mention clothes.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,532
Quit complaining.

32
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:12,800
The only place open was a rental
store for wedding ceremonies.

33
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,532
By the way, where are we?

34
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,866
I don't know!

35
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,399
My maps and compass were all stolen
with the ship, remember?

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,266
And my katana too, damn It.

37
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,666
I don't even have a pair of shoes.

38
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,799
It's good we're going
after the theif and all,

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,600
but why'd you set out to
sea without any preparation!?

40
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,932
Hey look, there's a kid over there.

41
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,133
Is he drowning?

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,867
Guess I gotta do something...

43
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,267
Hey, you alright over there?

44
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,067
Thanks for asking!

45
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,800
What?!

46
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,600
Akisu. Good work.

47
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,947
Easy victory, piece o' cake.

48
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,732
ldiots like them are easy to trick.

49
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,933
Damn It, you little brat!

50
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,799
But they're only a gang of poor folk.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,266
You can tell they don't have any
money just by the look of 'em.

52
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,467
Duped, eh?

53
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,133
A group of paupers, huh?

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,999
Who the hell are you?

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
Us?

56
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,067
Those sailing in search
of a mountain of treasure!

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,067
The Thief Brothers!

58
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,600
Borodo and...

59
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,333
Akisu!

60
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,200
Thief Brothers?

61
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,000
What's that?

62
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,867
It's just a bunch of trash!

63
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,467
Well, well... They're
nothing but scavengers.

64
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,267
That's not true! Watch
what you say about Borodo!

65
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,199
Borodo is the man who will steal the Diamond
Clock from Clockwork Island,

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,733
and become the greatest thief in the world!

67
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,599
You mean the famous Diamond Clock?

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,667
What's that?

69
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:54,732
The finest jewel and
greatest artifact ever crafted.

70
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,666
The most valuable clock in the world!

71
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,932
That s our knowledgeable Nami-san!

72
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,399
Ah, so If someone was able to steal It,

73
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,732
he really would be the
world's greatest thief.

74
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,533
Oh, then he's just like me!

75
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,732
I'm aimin' to be the greatest pirate
In the world, the Pirate King!

76
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,067
P-Pirate King...?

77
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:14,200
With this ship?

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,267
NO WAY IN HELL!

79
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,266
Our ship got stolen.

80
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,433
But we don't know the shithead who did It.

81
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:24,466
Does your ship...
have a pirate mark wearing a straw hat?

82
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:25,733
You've seen It?!

83
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,999
I saw it with the Trump Kyoudai.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,200
Trump Kyoudai?

85
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:33,399
They're a nefarious group of pirates that
have a stronghold on Clockwork Island,

86
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,300
and terrorize the surrounding area.

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,200
And the Diamond Clock that I'm
after is also in their possession.

88
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,600
They don't look so tough.

89
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,113
This bear guy is too cool! Awesome!~

90
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,532
Why did you say that?! I'M the one
that said that they were nothing!

91
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,066
What are you so happy for!?

92
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,533
They stole your ship!

93
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:51,266
You're supposed to be pissed!

94
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,266
You're supposed to wanna
beat the crap out of 'em!

95
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,333
B-Borodo, over there!

96
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:57,767
That's..!

97
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,267
The Trump Pirates.

98
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,267
Hey, Trump Kyoudai!

99
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,966
That is one sexy lady!

100
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,366
And what might you want?

101
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,733
Give us back the ship you stole from us!

102
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,866
Your ship? I've never seen It.

103
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,733
Like hell you haven't!

104
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,400
Alright! Time for a riddle!

105
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:30,733
Riddle?

106
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:34,666
1. Who will become the greatest pirate
In the world, the Pirate King?

107
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,467
Come on now, Boo Jack.
That one's way too easy.

108
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:40,533
Me!

109
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,132
Boo-boo! Wrong!

110
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,200
The answer is our boss, Bear King-sama.

111
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,832
No, you're wrong.

112
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,066
No common knowledge, I guess.

113
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:48,867
What?

114
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,333
What kinda riddle was that anyway?

115
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,732
I knew these guys were nothing special.

116
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:57,732
Boo-boo! Mocking the Trump Pirates, eh!?

117
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,733
Well then, it seems we
have to explain it to them.

118
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,367
They're out.

119
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,733
Not much choice.

120
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,000
Right, let's see it!

121
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,867
Hold this for me.

122
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,067
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOLET!

123
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:22,467
These guys... really are strong!

124
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,667
Oh... So they can fight.

125
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,000
Here I come!

126
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,066
That's my Boo Jack!

127
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,067
What is that guy?

128
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:37,467
He might be a bit tricky.

129
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,066
Yosh, leave this to me.

130
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,266
My famous "Escaping is Winning" master plan!

131
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,733
RUNNING AWAY!?

132
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,367
Oh my...

133
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,733
STOP!

134
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,733
W... what... happened...?

135
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,400
It's safe!

136
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:21,133
Now, It's riddle time again!
What is it want most?

137
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,733
Nami-san!

138
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:26,266
Yes, you're right.
We'll be taking her along with us.

139
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,599
What did you say!?

140
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,866
She'll be a souvenir for
Captain Bear King-sama.

141
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,900
After we take her away,

142
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:35,732
It'll be fun to see him
do this and that to her.

143
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,533
This and that!?

144
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
Shit.

145
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:01,480
Are we really going to struggle
to Clockwork Island with this.

146
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,400
Just keep quiet.

147
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:06,366
Borodo is a genius at
manipulating the wind and waves!

148
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:08,133
What're you so proud of, damn brat?

149
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:13,400
Just so you know, Nami-san was taken 'cause
you had to go and jump in the ocean.

150
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,633
After all the trouble I went
through to escape from them...

151
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:20,333
Is that your treasure?

152
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:25,333
That music box is the only thing
Akisu has left of his hometown.

153
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:26,867
His hometown?

154
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,000
When Akisu was an infant, I
found him floating on the sea.

155
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:41,267
He was listening to that lullaby.

156
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:48,967
That song was the only thing
that would calm Akisu down.

157
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,166
So, you're not real brothers?

158
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,347
We're brothers even If
we're not blood related!

159
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,133
Right!

160
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm gonna become a cool thief like Borodo
and never be hungry again!

161
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,066
A whirlpool!

162
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,867
Yeah. We're approaching Clockwork Island.

163
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,567
So that's...

164
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,400
Clockwork Island.

165
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,932
So, what should we do now?

166
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,732
We want to steal the Diamond Clock...

167
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:44,866
and you want to get your
nakama and ship back.

168
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,466
Either way we're all going to Trump Castle.

169
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:51,200
The base of those shitty
pirates who took Nami-san.

170
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,933
And Going Merry's there, too.

171
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,133
And my katana.

172
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:00,400
Then let's go together, to the Trump Castle!

173
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,800
Yeah!

174
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,599
What? Say that again!

175
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,732
You've occupied this island for 7 years now.

176
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,066
The weapon you are forcing us to build...

177
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,132
Has spilled too much blood.

178
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:25,667
And when that horrible weapon of
mass destruction is completed...

179
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,132
You've done enough!

180
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,800
Please don't taint the sea with more blood!

181
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:34,733
Good citizens, have you forgotten?

182
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,599
This island's main key is
under my complete control.

183
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,267
You know what'd happen to the island
If I were to break the key.

184
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,332
Even If you don't like It,
you should just keep quiet.

185
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,267
Show them out.

186
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,467
Aye!

187
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,000
Let me go!

188
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,400
I can walk on my own!

189
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:58,532
Once the "King Cannon" is completed,
everything will be in place.

190
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,666
And then I, Bear King-sama,
will control the entire sea!

191
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,867
And I will be the Pirate King!!

192
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,067
Ah! Welcome back-gas! Honey Queen-chan!

193
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:15,134
Oh? It's a young lady-gas!
Did you kidnap her-gas?

194
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,067
Stop it already, Skunk One.

195
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:22,999
This woman is Bear King-sama's sou-ve-nir.

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh! is she my bride?

197
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:30,767
What're you lookin' at?

198
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,734
She's my type!

199
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,533
P-P-Please marry me!

200
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,867
Oh? After just meeting you only once?

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,333
Unfortunately, I hate hairy men.

202
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,999
I'll shave it all off!

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,599
But I hate weak men even more.

204
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,266
I'm super strong!

205
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,399
But I know you can't win
against Luffy and the others.

206
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Luffy?

207
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:51,999
This girl's nakama.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,133
He's a freak whose body
can stretch like rubber.

209
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:56,666
Nothing to worry about.

210
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:00,134
This guy...
Would he be Straw Hat Luffy?

211
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:03,599
Eh? That weak little guy has a bounty?

212
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,133
And I expect Roronoa
Zoro was with him, as well.

213
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,067
Stick out your "flute" before you fall.

214
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,600
You mean "cane".

215
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,266
In any case, we should be cautious.

216
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,934
Heh! Caution, you say?
For this little twerp?

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,267
Alright then.

218
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,866
As you requested,
I'll show you how strong I really am.

219
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,466
His bounty is $30 million.

220
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,600
It will fund our...

221
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,600
Wedding party!

222
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,600
Too cool! Too cool!

223
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,599
How the hell did they
set up something like this?

224
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,599
They made it to defend
themselves from enemy invasion.

225
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,799
If someone tries to
invade up the stairway...

226
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,066
...they'll be killed before they
even reach the town above.

227
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,200
Traps, huh?

228
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,933
So how do we climb It?

229
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,866
There's an elevator running
through the center shaft.

230
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,134
When they come out to terrorize the seas...

231
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,399
...the secret door will open.

232
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,667
So until then, we'll...

233
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,399
WAIT!!

234
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,399
You IDIOTS!! Weren't you listening?

235
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,199
Those stairs are full of traps!

236
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,133
We'll just tackle them one at a time.

237
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:12,847
Waiting here's too much of a pain.
We'll just go right up.

238
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,199
This'll be fun!

239
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,534
You'd better listen to Borodo!

240
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,000
Guess I gotta do something.

241
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:55,034
Amazing!

242
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:58,767
Let's get going!

243
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,367
Yeah!

244
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,934
We finally reached the town!

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,666
What's that?! What is that?!

246
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,334
It's so cool!!

247
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:44,900
What kinda city is this?

248
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,467
This is Clockwork Town.

249
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,000
And that must be Trump Castle.

250
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,066
There's the Diamond Clock!

251
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,600
Yeah. The most valuable clock in the world!

252
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,334
And look at the top of the castle!

253
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,534
It's the Going Merry!

254
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:12,867
You can see It?

255
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,667
Yeah, I'm sure of It!
It's on top of the castle.

256
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:18,067
I can't tell It's so far...

257
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,000
Hey.

258
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:21,667
Hm?

259
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:25,180
It's interesting that you could tell where
our ship was from down here.

260
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,867
Well, thanks.

261
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,267
Shit...

262
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:31,467
Your feet...

263
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:34,134
Nah, It's nothing!

264
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,933
Alright! Let's move!

265
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:42,866
Yosha! We'll attack Trump Castle, right?

266
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,866
Eat... Change clothes.

267
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,867
W-What?

268
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,999
Hey, you okay with this?
Your nakama has been kidnapped.

269
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Aren't you going to attack?

270
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,533
You're not going to attack?

271
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:58,199
Since It's Nami we're
talking about, she'll be fine.

272
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,800
Ah, this is much easier to move In.

273
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:07,200
Alright, take care of the bill, okay?

274
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,334
Hey, wha...!

275
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,567
Here you go.

276
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,867
Come again.

277
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,266
Excuse me, can't I get a discount?

278
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,267
No.

279
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,533
I'm short on money this month.

280
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,067
I said no.

281
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,467
Hey Luffy, what're you standing there for?

282
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Remarkable workmanship!

283
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,000
All wind-up crafts?

284
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,400
Ah, what're you saying?

285
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,533
Clockwork...

286
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:38,266
Clockwork Island is...

287
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,599
Clockwork Island is a very fun...

288
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Clockwork Island is a very fun island.

289
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,667
Strangers. You know nothing of this place.

290
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:47,999
The time for calling this
island "fun" is in the distant past.

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,567
There was a time when
this was an island of dreams.

292
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:58,133
We created an autonomous clock to
commemorate the birth of our child.

293
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:01,266
We were congratulated by
all the people of the island.

294
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:05,400
Wow! So you two made the Diamond Clock?

295
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,700
But...

296
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:10,399
Ever since the Trump
Kyoudai occupied this island,

297
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,800
we've been living through Hell every day.

298
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Now... we're only making tools for killing!

299
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,466
If we rebel, Bear King
will destroy the island.

300
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:33,667
By occupying the castle that houses the central
key, there is no limit to their control.

301
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,100
That's cruel!

302
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,066
Fear not, for your problems
shall soon be solved!

303
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,599
Because the Trump Kyoudai,

304
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,933
will be defeated by these guys, the
greatest pirates in the world!

305
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:46,933
Hey, we haven't agreed to anything.

306
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,134
That's right!

307
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,133
We only want to get our stuff back!

308
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,966
Can't we just do that?

309
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,866
But didn't that just make your blood boil?

310
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,333
Doesn't it make your blood boil?

311
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,580
As long as those bastards are here,

312
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,066
Nothing can help this island.

313
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,533
Nothing can save It!

314
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,066
Well, well!

315
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:05,534
Aren't you just thinking the Diamond Clock
will be easier to steal without them around?

316
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,333
Ah! Hey!

317
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,534
I see.

318
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:10,466
We won't mind.

319
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,667
We'd be grateful If you
were to take it away.

320
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:16,667
Whenever I see It...
it only reminds me of a painful past.

321
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:19,000
However...

322
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,133
It's quite impossible to steal.

323
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,466
Those who have tried
before have all perished.

324
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,600
It's not impossible!

325
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:27,599
There's nothing Burodo can't steal!

326
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,066
Y-Yeah!

327
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,733
You just don't understand just how
terrible the Trump Kyoudai are.

328
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,733
If you don't want to die,
please leave this island at once!

329
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:37,399
We can't do that.

330
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
We've got some private business with them.

331
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,200
Death creates no future for you!

332
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:46,067
If you don't risk your life,
you can't create a future.

333
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,867
Right?

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,867
Let's go!

335
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:55,600
Yeah!

336
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,067
Please wait for me, Nami-san.

337
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,234
What're you doing now?

338
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:01,567
Akisu, let's go!

339
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,867
OK!

340
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,000
You people...!

341
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,267
That boy was...

342
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,200
Akisu...?

343
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,799
I win again!!

344
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
It s too bad, huh?

345
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,999
T-This girl's good...

346
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,466
If this keeps up... I'll soon be naked-gas!

347
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,199
But I wonder what's going on out there.

348
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,999
Could it be that none of her
friends are coming to save her?

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,599
They must've gotten killed
by the traps along the way.

350
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,733
Those guys won't die that easily!

351
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:44,047
It just wouldn't be a challenge then!

352
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:47,534
The "kakefu" in the well
does not see the wide ocean.

353
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,467
"Frog".

354
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,867
Well, I think I'll take a
look at what's going on.

355
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,199
What's this? Running away?

356
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,333
Do you know how much you owe me?

357
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:03,400
Or will you pay me with your body?

358
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:10,534
W-What-?

359
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,800
Well, I'll go, too.

360
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,667
That woman...

361
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
Did she...?

362
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,600
Sweet! We've got a bird's
eye view of the whole place.

363
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,266
Don't get too carried away.

364
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,267
There's a field of landmines down there.

365
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:43,000
Eh? Those windmills...

366
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:47,999
They look just like this thing.

367
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,999
Maybe it floated away from this island.

368
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,400
Eh? It's not working.

369
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,667
Let me look at it.

370
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:05,267
You're pretty slick!

371
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,800
Akisu is something else.

372
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,467
Even though he's never practiced,

373
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,400
he can fix of all kinds of machines.

374
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,067
Alright, fixed now.

375
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:17,600
Whoa!

376
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:19,466
It's working! You're great!

377
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,667
Thanks!

378
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,734
Oh my, you're still alive?

379
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:32,000
It's that sexy lady!

380
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,466
What should I do first~!?

381
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:34,534
Get a grip already!

382
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,199
She's ain't no normal human!

383
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,799
She has the powers of the Devil's Fruit!

384
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,466
Pin Pon! Quite right!

385
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,134
The Toro Toro Fruit to be precise.

386
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:45,134
Boo Jack, reward them.

387
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,267
Waaaaai~! Reward me~!

388
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,600
Like hell!

389
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:52,534
Take this!

390
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:56,567
Sanji!

391
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:58,188
It went straight through his foot!

392
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,200
You saved him...!

393
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:06,967
HOW NAUGHTY!

394
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,934
SANJI!

395
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:26,267
Sanji-kun!

396
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:27,901
N-Nami-san...

397
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,266
I feel ashamed to look this way.

398
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,533
Sanji-kun...

399
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:33,800
See how kind I am?

400
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:37,066
I didn't kill him because he's your nakama.

401
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,466
Hmph. I don't care about him anymore.

402
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,866
A strong man like you is better!

403
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:42,934
Didn't I tell ya?

404
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:45,866
But, marriage is a very
important event in a girl's life.

405
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:46,934
I know.

406
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:47,567
So in exchange, my nakama...

407
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,866
Oi, Skunk One!

408
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,134
Aye! I'll help her decide-gas!

409
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,301
Wait! That's not what I meant!

410
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:56,001
So what shall we do next?

411
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,467
Shit, how did it end up this way?

412
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,933
It wouldn't have happened If I had
my pachinko balls and slingshot.

413
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:09,466
Don't make up excuses!
You just aren't brave enough.

414
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:09,934
What?

415
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,267
If it were Borodo,

416
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:14,501
he'd try to save me even If his hands
and feet were chopped off.

417
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,267
Your hand...

418
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,267
For you?

419
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:21,400
That's right! Borodo is amazing!

420
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,334
He risks his life to protect
me. He's a great man!

421
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:24,867
Hey.

422
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:28,372
What're you bragging about If you
always need him to save you?

423
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:33,401
Well... I'm just a kid.
I'm not strong enough.

424
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,201
Man or child.

425
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:36,933
Strength or none!

426
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:39,000
It doesn't mean a thing
once you're out at sea!

427
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:39,534
That's enough!

428
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,047
What do you know about Akisu?

429
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:42,001
I DON'T!

430
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:46,066
I just hate those who always think that
It's natural for others to save them!

431
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,533
It's not like I want to be!

432
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:48,734
What was that?

433
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,266
Well, let's get going.

434
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:01,133
Hey kid, If you're afraid of dying, go home.

435
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:01,667
What?

436
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,867
'Coz... I ain't gonna
save a weak little crybaby.

437
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,133
Who's going back? I'm...

438
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:11,667
Okay. Then, don't hold back!

439
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,967
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOLET!

440
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:17,767
Here I go!

441
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,067
Ah! They're after me!

442
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:22,467
You think you can do it alone!?

443
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:25,867
Oi, Zoro, what do we do now!?

444
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,467
Leave it to me!

445
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,267
And thus Roronoa Zoro has arrived.

446
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,367
What?

447
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:55,934
It's completed! Finally!

448
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,400
As expected of our Bear King-sama!

449
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:01,714
So much better than our last boss El
Drago-sama! Even your weapons are special!

450
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:06,334
The great killing machine, the
"King Cannon", has been completed!!

451
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:08,601
Like a "cotton swab" for an ogre!

452
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,134
You mean an "iron club"?

453
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,267
The King Cannon...

454
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:13,600
Hrmm... That's It!

455
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:16,066
And now our legend shall begin.

456
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:19,801
With me as ruler of the
world's oceans, the Pirate King!

457
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,267
Sanji-kun!

458
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,800
Nami-san. Sorry...

459
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:29,533
It'll be alright. These guys
are idiots, I can handle...

460
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:31,601
That's no good.

461
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,266
I...

462
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:37,001
I wanted to save Nami-san
with only my own strength.

463
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,001
And then...

464
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,134
"Thank you, Sanji-kun~!!"

465
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:47,467
Nami-san would embrace me, And then
we'd do this, and that together!

466
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:48,901
Hey now...

467
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:50,067
Hey, you letch!

468
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:52,600
What's your relationship with my fiance!?

469
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:56,933
The relation being I have rubbed suntan
lotion on her smooth skin.

470
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:58,467
WHAT WAS THAT?!

471
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,734
We'll crucify this one!

472
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,400
Even If you are her nakama,

473
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:05,001
You're gonna die in a public execution!

474
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,000
You should watch your mouth!

475
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:15,466
Weak pests like you can't be called nakama.

476
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,733
There's no way you could save her!

477
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:23,334
You freaking pig...
I'm gonna make you eat those words.

478
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:37,401
This reeks, what is It?

479
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,200
Welcome to Trump Castle!

480
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,400
Your nakama have been
waiting for quite some time-gas.

481
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:45,601
What?

482
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:51,401
Sanji!

483
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:55,734
But Bear King-sama seems
to be in a good mood-gas.

484
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:58,534
Now, who shall be next to be captured-gas?

485
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:00,934
Gross!

486
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:02,067
What's this smell?

487
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:03,533
It's Devil Gas-gas.

488
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,733
If it get's in your system,
you'll soon be paralyzed...

489
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:07,533
...and totally helpless-gas.

490
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:10,467
I'm full, FULL of gas-gas!

491
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,401
Hey, he's not joking! If
he lets out that much...!

492
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:14,867
Luffy!

493
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:17,200
Ah~ It's no use.
I don't feel like doing anything...

494
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,401
Oi!!

495
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:29,400
Akisu, you said I didn't have
any courage before, right?

496
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:31,667
Then you better watch
me carefully now, brat.

497
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:36,601
And see just how great
I, Usopp-sama, can be!

498
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,667
Usopp!

499
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,600
Hey! Let go!

500
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:45,334
N-N-No way I'm letting go!

501
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:47,001
He's insane.

502
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:49,000
I'll take care of him!

503
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,067
Don't worry, just hurry and go!

504
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,601
Usopp...

505
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:56,534
Have you realized it yet?

506
00:27:59,001 --> 00:27:59,934
Usopp!

507
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:01,001
Let's go, Akisu!

508
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:01,801
But...

509
00:28:01,802 --> 00:28:03,666
Don't waste his courage!

510
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,467
Move It, Akisu!

511
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:14,001
Damn you!

512
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:16,600
What a nuisance!

513
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,333
He should've been unconscious ages ago!

514
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:19,534
Usopp!

515
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,533
You worried about that man?

516
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,666
Of course! He's my nakama!

517
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:27,533
The only person you need to worry for is me!

518
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:29,734
Crucify and execute him too!

519
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,267
Aye!

520
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,134
Hoi, gas!

521
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,601
Hoi, gas!

522
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,001
And what were you trying to do, gas?

523
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:46,667
Hey now, you're going to
get your lovely dress dirty.

524
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,934
Fighting's of no use, my dear.

525
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:12,467
Hey, up there!

526
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:16,067
Usopp!

527
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:28,934
What's this?

528
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,600
It's the island's main key.

529
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:33,001
It supports the whole
island from this castle.

530
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,701
Hey, let's get going!

531
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,934
Akisu?

532
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:44,334
Akisu!

533
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,200
What the hell's going on!?

534
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:55,600
Akisu!

535
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:59,133
I had to rely on you again, Borodo.

536
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:00,134
Akisu.

537
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:02,066
Don't worry about those stupid things.

538
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,133
We're... brothers.

539
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:06,133
Why is this so heavy?

540
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:08,200
It's a trap, we won't last long!

541
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,001
Borodo, help us out!

542
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:18,666
Well you guys sure are in a predicament.

543
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,601
What a disappointment.

544
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:25,400
Looks like even with all of you together,
you can't beat the Trump Kyoudai.

545
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:26,401
What?

546
00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:29,933
I even stole your ship and brought you here.

547
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:31,867
You're the one... who took our ship?

548
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:35,466
So that's It. I knew
you were fishy all along.

549
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,400
So it was you!

550
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,733
You deceived us so you
could steal the Diamond Clock!

551
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:43,134
I never wanted that from the start.

552
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:44,267
What?

553
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:47,467
What I wanted was for you guys
to defeat the Trump Kyoudai.

554
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,467
To free this island.

555
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,934
That was all.

556
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:52,666
W-Why?

557
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,000
For him...

558
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:58,133
I wanted to see him return to
his family living on this island.

559
00:30:58,134 --> 00:30:59,933
So, this island is Akisu's...

560
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:02,067
It's his hometown. I'm sure of It.

561
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,333
Sorry to have dragged you into this.

562
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:07,800
I've got another favor to ask.

563
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:10,733
If something happens to
me, please take care of Akisu.

564
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,801
Wha...?

565
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:14,133
As things are, looks like
It's up to me to fight them.

566
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:17,000
ldiot! You know you can't win! Come help us!

567
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:18,401
Leave it already.

568
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:23,934
If I risk my life, maybe
I can create a future.

569
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,367
Right?

570
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:33,267
Borodo!

571
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:36,201
That fool. Does he want to die?

572
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:39,267
Hey Luffy! Can't you do
something about this ceiling?

573
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:41,134
There'll be none of that.

574
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,466
Are you doing this?

575
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:46,066
Roronoa Zoro, it has been quite a while.

576
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:47,866
You gave me this scar,
right here on my face.

577
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,867
I shall never forget that!

578
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,067
You...

579
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:53,534
Who are you?

580
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:55,266
What? Don't you remember?

581
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:56,334
Not a bit.

582
00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:58,666
I don't etch weaklings in my memory.

583
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,266
That's for sure.

584
00:32:00,267 --> 00:32:02,666
Then I'll make you feel It.

585
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,933
The "technique" your mouth brings upon you.

586
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,333
Don't you mean "catastrophe"?

587
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:08,134
Silence! Hissatsu!

588
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,834
HARI HARI KEN!

589
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,801
Zoro, why the hell did you say that!?

590
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,934
Zoro... You...

591
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,801
That was dangerous.

592
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:22,067
They all got me.

593
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,733
Sorry, Luffy, can you hold on a bit longer?

594
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,601
I'll clean up here.

595
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,200
Don't try to hide it with that cool face!

596
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:34,400
I put some of the poison from Skunk
One's gas on those needles.

597
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:37,066
Your body will soon become unable to move.

598
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:38,267
Dammit!

599
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,867
There!

600
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,134
Zoro!

601
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,601
While you were crying,
a "bridge" came to you.

602
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,201
A... A "bee".

603
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:57,001
ZOROOO!!

604
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,801
What's going on?!

605
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,267
Where's the $30,000,000 guy?

606
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:15,000
By now he's been crushed under the ceiling.

607
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:18,466
We were able to show Bear King-sama's
genuine strength without him fighting!

608
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,600
And now you can marry her, right?

609
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:24,200
I'll go immediately to
prepare the wedding party-gas.

610
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,101
Alright!

611
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:29,268
The main attraction will be the testing our
ultimate killing machine, The King Cannon!

612
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:36,467
The targets will be those three!

613
00:33:36,468 --> 00:33:37,801
What did you say?!

614
00:33:40,168 --> 00:33:43,400
And then you'll become
the bride of the Pirate King.

615
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,801
How's that? You must overjoyed.

616
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:51,268
Who the hell would marry something like you?

617
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:55,733
Are you aware of what you're saying?

618
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:58,866
Compared to being married
to something like you...

619
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:01,334
I'd rather be killed with them!

620
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:05,201
That can be arranged!

621
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:10,066
Cancel the wedding party and make
It a memorial to my broken heart!

622
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:12,467
And execute this woman along with them!

623
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:13,868
Aye!

624
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:18,667
Luffy, what're you doing?

625
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:19,868
Where's Borodo?

626
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:22,400
He went to face the Trump Kyoudai.

627
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:23,201
What did you say?

628
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:24,068
Borodo!

629
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:26,934
O-o-oi! What 'bout me?

630
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,268
Don't leave me like this!

631
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:29,201
What? You?

632
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:37,133
Sorry. I went ahead and
stole all of your dynamite.

633
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:37,668
That voice!

634
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,067
Borodo?

635
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:41,001
He really does want to die!

636
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:42,801
This is how I work.

637
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,267
You'll all die with me!

638
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,534
Heh, are you an idiot?

639
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:48,534
What?

640
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:51,866
You can't use something like that here.

641
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:53,600
Look here carefully.

642
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,067
Do you want to destroy the island's key?

643
00:35:56,068 --> 00:35:58,134
T-The island's key...

644
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:01,000
Do it If you dare.
The whole island will be destroyed.

645
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,601
You know that right, boy?

646
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,167
BORODO!

647
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:30,701
Like "dried bits of fish"
flying into the flame.

648
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,334
Heh, It's "summer bugs".

649
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:37,201
You cur!

650
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:43,201
Borodo... Don't you lay a finger on Borodo!

651
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:45,017
Akisu!

652
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,868
You... little...!

653
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:00,767
He...

654
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,267
W-What's the?

655
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:44,801
I'm finally here!

656
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:53,201
What's that sound?

657
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:55,067
It's Trump Castle!

658
00:37:55,267 --> 00:37:56,467
Let's move!

659
00:37:57,368 --> 00:37:58,568
Those poor children.

660
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:05,601
LUFFY!!!

661
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:07,401
Took you long enough, jerk.

662
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:08,867
LUFFY!

663
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:10,501
Slow ass.

664
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,933
So you're Straw Hat Luffy?

665
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:14,501
Huh? Where is everyone?

666
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:20,000
I found something cool!

667
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:21,868
What the...?

668
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,201
- What?
- You IDIOT

669
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,267
- Drop It!
- Let it GO!

670
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:25,001
I should get rid of It?

671
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:25,401
Okay.

672
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,601
Let go of it!

673
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,534
Say, where are my nakama?

674
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:42,466
YOU JUST BLEW THEM UP!

675
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:43,667
WHAT?!

676
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,866
Luffy! You're always so reckless!

677
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:54,534
Forget about It. He got us out, didn't he?

678
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,666
Yeah, seems that way.

679
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,200
What? You all came out fine.

680
00:38:58,201 --> 00:38:59,401
You're disappointed!?

681
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:05,867
Usopp!

682
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,933
I won't let you touch Nami-san...

683
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,133
And I'll kick the shit
outta your riddling ass.

684
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:18,701
You're going to kick me?

685
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:23,268
What can you possibly do with
feet as badly injured as that?

686
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,867
Bast...

687
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:26,934
What the hell are you...?

688
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,767
Usopp!

689
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:33,101
HISSATSU TAMAGO BOSHI!

690
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:37,066
It reeks! A rotten egg-gas!

691
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:39,134
I can't stand smelly things-gas!

692
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:40,568
You're one to talk.

693
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:41,769
You bastard!

694
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,534
H-H-H-Here! Catch these!

695
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,267
Thanks!

696
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:51,167
Zoro!

697
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:59,001
Attacking from behind. Bad form.

698
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,267
GOMU GOMU NO GATTLING GUN!

699
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:10,734
Eh?

700
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,068
N-Not a scratch!

701
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:16,272
My body is strong as steel. The
power of the Kachi Kachi Fruit

702
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:18,667
A flimsy little rubber twerp like you...

703
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,201
...can't beat me.

704
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:22,968
I see. That's how it Is.
So, it's possible.

705
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:24,934
YOU'RE AGREEING WITH HIM!?

706
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,333
Heh, admitting defeat already?

707
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:28,534
Nope. Not at all.

708
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:30,400
We never lose, you know.

709
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:31,601
What?

710
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:35,466
Hmph. What difference will
it make by putting those on?

711
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:40,401
A weak guy like you can't protect anything.

712
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:43,201
Hey, got a light?

713
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:46,734
Just die against my toge-toge armor!

714
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,401
What is it...

715
00:40:57,968 --> 00:41:00,001
...that I can't do!?

716
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:09,067
That guy's really great!

717
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,468
I told you before!

718
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:13,868
I'm gonna make you eat your words!

719
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:19,268
He did it!

720
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:22,734
Shithead.

721
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:35,601
Roronoa Zoro. I admire you.

722
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,801
You can still stand
after taking my dokubari.

723
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,868
But merely standing
takes up all of your energy!

724
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,468
Doesn't matter.

725
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:48,934
I'll tell you up front.
I won't ever lose to anyone.

726
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:52,468
Because losing is...

727
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:54,134
Absolutely unacceptable!

728
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:03,400
Stop struggling, gas!

729
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:05,133
You've got nowhere to run, gas!

730
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:08,201
Have you forgotten, gas?
The power of my gas?

731
00:42:10,768 --> 00:42:12,001
And now it's over-gas!

732
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,268
Stop! No! Stop! Stay back!

733
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,334
Yeah, right!

734
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,734
KAEN BOSHI!

735
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,934
YOU GOT WHAT WAS COMING TO YOU, DAMMIT!!

736
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:42,201
GOMU GOMU NO MUCHI!

737
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,401
Well... this isn't going so well.

738
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:04,501
Watch out!

739
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:11,268
Looks like you're in a great deal of pain.

740
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:13,801
It's just "shrimp" coming out of you.

741
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,734
Heh, it's "rust".

742
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:18,601
You wretched knave!

743
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:20,201
HARI HARI KEN!

744
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,368
Awesome!

745
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,400
Cur!

746
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:29,400
You should be paralyzed by now...

747
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:30,868
How!?

748
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:35,868
Unfortunately for you, I can't fall here.

749
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:41,934
Because at the end of a distant road
there's a man waiting for me.

750
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,768
Dying before I face him is...

751
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:46,268
OUT OF THE QUESTION!

752
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,601
ONIGIRI!

753
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,868
He did it!!

754
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:02,601
No! This is bad!

755
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:08,001
Hope you had fun!

756
00:44:08,468 --> 00:44:09,868
N-No way!

757
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:14,400
Hey, let me out! Let me out!

758
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,934
It's no good~

759
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:22,934
Crap, what's with this guy?

760
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:27,534
Luffy!

761
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:39,234
HOT BOILING SPECIAL!

762
00:44:46,534 --> 00:44:48,634
GOMU GOMU NO...

763
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:51,601
HOT!

764
00:44:52,468 --> 00:44:53,735
That won't work!

765
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:57,001
Heh! Rubberman, it's over!

766
00:44:57,168 --> 00:44:58,468
BEAR KlNG!

767
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:19,467
Wow.

768
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:21,135
Borodo!

769
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:23,468
This one won't miss.

770
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:26,468
Bastard. That's my great King Cannon!

771
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:32,868
Akisu!

772
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,268
AKlSU!

773
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:45,068
I guess this makes me a real man of the sea.

774
00:45:45,935 --> 00:45:47,801
AKlSU!!

775
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:50,735
Akisu! Hold on!

776
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:56,667
Heh, how nice of you to shoot yourself.

777
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:59,134
Though why you'd want to save someone
that much is beyond me.

778
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:02,768
What an stupid, pathetic little brat.

779
00:46:03,668 --> 00:46:04,668
You...

780
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:06,135
What did you just say?

781
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:09,601
I said that he's a stupid, pathetic brat!

782
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,468
I am gonna make you PAY!!

783
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:37,001
How dare you...

784
00:46:38,235 --> 00:46:40,135
...grab me like that!

785
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:44,400
You will be a victim of the King Cannon!

786
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,601
Die!

787
00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:48,635
LUFFY!

788
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,135
What?

789
00:46:54,868 --> 00:46:56,701
GOMU GOMU NO...

790
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:01,201
SCREW!

791
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,601
W-What the?

792
00:47:36,602 --> 00:47:38,267
It can't be! The island's key!

793
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:39,468
The key!?

794
00:47:39,635 --> 00:47:41,534
H-Hey... This isn't good!

795
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:42,800
What's going on?

796
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:43,801
Let's just get outta here!

797
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:45,135
Yeah!

798
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,401
Hey, Luffy!

799
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:47,201
Luffy!

800
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:47,868
Luffy!

801
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:49,268
Luffy!

802
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,535
The island's key has been destroyed.

803
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:57,400
The island is destined to crumble with it.

804
00:47:57,401 --> 00:47:58,901
Is everyone ready?

805
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:00,668
Akisu...

806
00:48:00,935 --> 00:48:02,135
Akisu!

807
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,001
Akisu... you...

808
00:48:05,768 --> 00:48:07,935
Are you alright? Akisu?

809
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:11,201
It only hurt a little.

810
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:14,468
You had me worried there.

811
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:15,701
Borodo...

812
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:17,735
I can hear something.

813
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:31,167
The Diamond Clock is chiming.

814
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:34,268
It hasn't chimed for so long.

815
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:37,401
This melody...

816
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:39,868
It sounds like Akisu's music box.

817
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:47,934
The one who made that
music box... could it be...

818
00:48:47,935 --> 00:48:49,535
...you, Miss?

819
00:48:51,168 --> 00:48:54,335
Could... you be..?

820
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:56,735
Yes.

821
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,735
There's no other way!

822
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:03,401
What are you up to!? You can't run away!

823
00:49:05,868 --> 00:49:08,100
Live! Survive!

824
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:11,501
In a place where the Trump
Pirates can never reach!

825
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:14,701
I could only hope...

826
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:17,268
that my child wouldn't die.

827
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,401
I could only hope...

828
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:24,868
Then you are... Akisu's...

829
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:27,735
His mother.

830
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:39,668
It's so ironic.

831
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,801
The weapons we created...

832
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:45,001
Destroyed our island.

833
00:50:46,035 --> 00:50:47,868
It couldn't be helped.

834
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:49,467
It was fate.

835
00:50:49,468 --> 00:50:52,267
With it go our dark
memories of the past 7 years.

836
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:55,200
As long as we still have our skill,

837
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:57,801
we can build a new island!

838
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:00,167
Yes.

839
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:05,468
This is the future that we
opened by risking our lives.

840
00:51:06,301 --> 00:51:08,401
We will gladly take it.

841
00:51:12,968 --> 00:51:14,267
Oh no, you're bleeding.

842
00:51:14,268 --> 00:51:17,868
I'm fine! I'm a brave man of the sea!

843
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:26,001
Mom.

844
00:51:30,268 --> 00:51:32,668
Mom,

845
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:35,701
Your hands are warm.

846
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:48,801
Akisu.

847
00:51:57,967 --> 00:51:58,535
Hey.

848
00:51:58,967 --> 00:52:00,168
You okay 'bout this?

849
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:01,801
Yeah.

850
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:04,534
His folks are great people.

851
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:07,534
Akisu will be the
happiest guy on that island.

852
00:52:07,535 --> 00:52:09,800
I don't feel the least bit lonely.

853
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:12,600
In fact, I'm relieved to be alone.

854
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:15,334
He's always tripping me up.

855
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:19,401
Now I can keep all this treasure I took
from the Trump Kyoudai for myself.

856
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:22,200
But, will you really be alright alone?

857
00:52:22,201 --> 00:52:24,801
You've lost your only partner, right?

858
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,935
You can't call yourself a
"gang" of thieves anymore.

859
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:30,268
I'll find someone someday.

860
00:52:30,667 --> 00:52:32,735
I don't think you have to.

861
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:34,734
Hold up, Borodo!

862
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,935
Akisu!

863
00:52:35,936 --> 00:52:37,867
How could you leave me behind!

864
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:40,600
I knew you'd go and try something like this!

865
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:42,681
But you finally met
up with your folks and...

866
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,068
Don't talk stupid!

867
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:46,200
I'm a brave man of the sea now.

868
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:49,201
I gotta risk my life to
finish what I want to do!

869
00:52:49,268 --> 00:52:50,600
But, you...

870
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:54,335
We're the world's best,
the Thief Brothers, aren't we?

871
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:56,967
Akisu...

872
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:03,801
Right.

873
00:53:03,802 --> 00:53:08,134
Okay. Let's split the Trump
Kyoudai treasure now.

874
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:08,801
Hey now.

875
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:10,001
50/50 right?

876
00:53:10,002 --> 00:53:11,734
I'm an adult now, too.

877
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:13,267
We agreed 70/30!

878
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:15,534
What? Don't be so stingy!

879
00:53:15,535 --> 00:53:17,168
I'm not being stingy!
