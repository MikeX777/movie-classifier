1
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:34,275
This is the dream
grown young.

2
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,864
The dream so bravely tended

3
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:38,969
through a century of fears.

4
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:41,455
Through the years of working,

5
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,423
praying, striving, learning,

6
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,081
the dream become a beacon

7
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:49,014
brightly burning.

8
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:06,549
Black colleges are spaces

9
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,207
where black people are affirmed.

10
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:11,830
You could be yourself
and develop yourself

11
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,728
in this rich soil.

12
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:21,150
It's a space that is
an unapologetic black space.

13
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:26,396
These are places where there's
incredible freedom to explore.

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,023
Wade: We wanted
to better ourselves.

15
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:35,923
We wanted to have an institution
where there's people like us,

16
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:39,375
all wanted to be more
than the status quo.

17
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,239
Crenshaw: The question
for African Americans has

18
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:45,588
always been,
what is education's purpose?

19
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:48,280
Who controls it?

20
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,800
And what is the relationship
with education

21
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,182
to the broader aspirations
of our people?

22
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:06,505
♪ Well, I need more power ♪

23
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,748
♪ Power, Lord ♪

24
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:10,233
♪ I didn't need more power ♪

25
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,579
♪ Power, Lord ♪

26
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,892
♪ I need the everlasting power ♪

27
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,135
♪ Power, Lord ♪

28
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,826
♪ I need the everlasting power ♪

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,449
Marrs: "On every gate
around the stable

30
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:21,175
as on the plow handles,

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,902
you can see where I had
been trying to write

32
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,593
and every chance that offered

33
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:28,286
would be learning my ABCs" --

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,184
Elijah Marrs.

35
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,737
"There were some niggers

36
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:34,084
that wanted learnin' so bad,

37
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:37,743
they would study by the light
of lightwood torches,

38
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:39,366
but one thing sure --

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,921
They'd better not let no white
folks find out about it" --

40
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,474
William McWeather.

41
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,517
Slavery was more brutal
than we can imagine.

42
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,659
Brutality went with the system.

43
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,148
Gasman: But there's another
type of brutality that

44
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,874
took place during slavery,

45
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:06,772
and that was the brutality
of ignorance,

46
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:09,085
keeping intellectual thought,

47
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,571
keeping learning,
keeping reading,

48
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:15,056
knowledge from slaves.

49
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:17,680
The more that a system
denies you the chance

50
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:18,991
to read and to write,

51
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:20,683
the more that thing,

52
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,443
reading and writing,
becomes valuable,

53
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:23,686
becomes precious,

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,517
becomes a prize that
you must have.

55
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:32,142
"I had no schooling
whatsoever while I was a slave.

56
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:35,663
On several occasions, I went
as far as the schoolhouse door

57
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,976
with one of my young mistresses.

58
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,082
I had the feeling that
getting into that schoolhouse

59
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:44,948
would be the same
as getting into paradise,"

60
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:47,123
Booker T. Washington.

61
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:50,678
When they saw white people
reading, enslaved people

62
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:53,267
called that
"talking to books."

63
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:56,443
The idea that
this piece of paper

64
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:57,858
that someone was looking at,

65
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:00,343
they could actually
communicate with,

66
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:03,864
gave them a sense that this
was a kind of knowledge

67
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:07,005
that opened up all kinds
of opportunities.

68
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,734
A slaveholder could
do virtually anything

69
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:14,046
to his slave.

70
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,738
He could work a slave to death.

71
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:17,015
He could rape a slave.

72
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,430
He could sell a slave.

73
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:20,294
"It's my property,"
the argument was.

74
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,193
"So I can do whatever I want to
with my property,

75
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:26,196
except one thing I can't do
to my property --

76
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,922
I can't teach my property.

77
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:32,893
I can't teach my slave
how to read or write."

78
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,447
An educated black population

79
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:39,106
could not be an enslaved
black population.

80
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,420
The teaching of slaves to
read and write has a tendency

81
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:44,560
to excite dissatisfaction
in their minds.

82
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:47,873
any person or persons
who shall attempt to teach

83
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,220
any free person of color
or slave to spell...

84
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:51,739
if a white man or woman be fined

85
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:53,569
no less than $100 or imprisoned.

86
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:56,192
shall be whipped
at the discretion of the court

87
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:59,160
not exceeding 50 lashes...
The revised code

88
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:01,024
of the laws of Virginia.
The state of Alabama...

89
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,198
The laws of North Carolina.

90
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:03,268
Acts and resolutions

91
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,616
of the state of South Carolina.

92
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,549
It didn't just
happen in the South.

93
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,138
Some abolitionists wanted
to start a college

94
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:14,037
for black youth in New Haven,

95
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:16,454
where Yale University
is located.

96
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:19,388
Yale and the town officials
said,

97
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:20,527
"No, absolutely not.

98
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,322
That's not happening here."

99
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:26,464
This letter is from the mayor
of New Haven, Connecticut,

100
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:30,364
and it says, "The location
of a college of blacks here

101
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,504
would be totally ruinous
to the city,

102
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,368
whose certain effect..."
Whose certain effect

103
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:37,406
will be to lower the town's
public morals,

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,685
to drive from our city
its female schools,

105
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,273
its throngs of summer visitors.

106
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:46,484
The founding of colleges
for educating colored people

107
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:49,383
is unwarrantable
and dangerous interference

108
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:52,248
with the internal concerns
of the Southern states

109
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:54,768
and ought to be discouraged.

110
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:57,771
It's happening all
over the country,

111
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:00,877
this discrimination,
this repression,

112
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,673
this desire to make sure

113
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,712
that black people remain
subordinate to whites

114
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:09,748
is something that's national.

115
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:12,268
It's not just Southern, at all,

116
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:15,029
and I think that we sometimes
forget that.

117
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:24,073
Booker: "When I was
still quite a child,

118
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,902
I could hear the slaves
in our quarters

119
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,008
whispering that
something unusual

120
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,320
was about to take place,

121
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:32,392
and it meant their freedom.

122
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:36,637
There was not a single slave
on our plantation

123
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,501
that could read a line,

124
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:40,710
but in some way,
we were kept informed

125
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:43,506
of the progress of the law" --

126
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:47,648
Booker T. Washington.

127
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:49,443
Washington: As soon as
the war breaks out,

128
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,999
African Americans flee
the plantation,

129
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:56,899
and once they get
behind Union lines,

130
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,591
they call them contrabands.

131
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:03,457
The first thing they want to do
is to get an education,

132
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:06,529
so in the evening,
when they finished their labor,

133
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,566
they go to these
contraband schools,

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,120
and as the women say,
catch a lesson.

135
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:13,467
♪ One by one, two by two ♪

136
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,780
♪ Three by three
and a four by four ♪

137
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:39,493
Adams: "I is anxious
to learn how to read

138
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:43,221
so I can study and find out
about many things" --

139
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,672
William Adams.

140
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,088
"It is wonderful how a
people who have been

141
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:50,193
so long crushed to the earth

142
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:53,231
can have so greedy desire
for knowledge

143
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,234
and such a capability
for attaining it.

144
00:07:56,268 --> 00:08:00,031
One old woman took her seat
among the little ones.

145
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,620
She was, at least,
60 years old" --

146
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:04,449
Charlotte Forten.

147
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:08,902
They feel that,
if they can get an education,

148
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:13,769
if they can get knowledge,
then other things will follow.

149
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:17,773
This is the beginning
of education in the South.

150
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:31,131
Booker: Suddenly, as if
at the sound of a trumpet,

151
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:32,995
a whole race that
had been slumbering

152
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,722
for centuries in barbarism

153
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:39,760
awoke and started off
one morning...

154
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:41,693
to school.

155
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,045
In the immediate years
after the war,

156
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,290
one of the first things that
formerly-enslaved people did

157
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,499
was to open schools.

158
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,747
Many of the people who
were so-called teachers

159
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,990
were really not capable,

160
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,268
knowledge-wise,
of being teachers.

161
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:07,339
They were simply teaching
what they knew.

162
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,135
If they knew up
to a 6th grade level,

163
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,861
then that's what
they would teach,

164
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:15,693
and so the first thing that had
to be done after the war

165
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:21,181
was to train people
to actually teach.

166
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:22,596
After the Civil War was over,

167
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:26,289
the South is devastated
in all kinds of ways.

168
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,360
The American
Missionary Association

169
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,914
recognizes the damage,

170
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,607
and they see an opportunity
to save the South.

171
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,334
They come down and set up
all these schools.

172
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,233
"We can now lift
them out of the pit.

173
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:41,477
Essential parts of the work
can only be done

174
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:45,170
by Northern voluntary
Christian organizations.

175
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:47,828
They can bring physical relief.

176
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,761
They can establish schools,

177
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:52,730
and they can bear the light
of the Gospel."

178
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,563
Washington: The large majority
of them were also dedicated

179
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,014
to the idea that
the enslaved people

180
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:04,638
needed to be "civilized."

181
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:07,503
One person termed it
"Yankee-fied,"

182
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:10,368
and they want to create
a kind of culture

183
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,302
that is, essentially,
a white culture,

184
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:15,442
and the AMA is the main

185
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,272
independent organization
that set this up --

186
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,515
first the schools

187
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:22,242
and then colleges
that are going to evolve

188
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:25,659
into the historically
black colleges.

189
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:28,248
The African Methodist Episcopal Church,
the AME,

190
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:29,594
start to say, "Wait a second.

191
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,424
We want to have
our own education system

192
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,082
in terms that we understand.

193
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:39,604
We have ideas here,
black ideas."

194
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,194
And so they start forming
their own colleges.

195
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:48,199
They wanted those schools
to be as free as possible

196
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,857
from paternalism,

197
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,375
from racism,

198
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,414
whether subtle or blatant.

199
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,762
"No man or community of men

200
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,213
can elevate another.

201
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:06,182
Elevation must come from within.

202
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,426
What the North and the South,
however,

203
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,878
can do is to cease
their injustice

204
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:16,710
and allow the Negro
to educate himself" --

205
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:19,920
Bishop Benjamin Tanner,
AME Church.

206
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,892
The federal government
also began creating separate

207
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:29,861
public black and white colleges
in the South.

208
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:35,798
By the late 1800s, there were
over 86 black colleges.

209
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,319
Many of them were created
by the AME Church, the AMA,

210
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:42,322
and the federal government.

211
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:45,946
The South's reaction was
one of incredible anxiety.

212
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:48,708
Southern planters elite
had an investment

213
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,744
in this certain kind
of workforce,

214
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,748
a workforce that they had been
able to keep docile.

215
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:57,924
Education was going
to turn that upside down,

216
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,513
and the planter elite said,
"That simply can't happen."

217
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,104
In Tuskegee, Alabama,

218
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,867
nearly every black school
that developed in the county

219
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,041
was destroyed,

220
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,181
or the teachers were run off.

221
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,425
One of the heartbreaking stories

222
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,014
is the lynching of a professor
at Talladega

223
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:21,982
because he was teaching
African-American students.

224
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:26,953
He wrote this very powerful
letter to his wife.

225
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,748
"My dear wife...

226
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,922
I die tonight.

227
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:35,202
It has been determined by those
that think I deserve it.

228
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:40,035
God only knows I have only
sought to educate the Negro.

229
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:42,382
God of mercy,
bless you and keep you,

230
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,005
dear wife and children.

231
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,250
Your William."

232
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:52,012
Alexander:
Between 1866 and 1872,

233
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,671
approximately 20,000 people
are killed,

234
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:57,535
blacks and whites in the South,

235
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,364
all because of
this perceived threat

236
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,747
that education will
unlock something.

237
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,695
Taylor: Despite the violence
and intimidation,

238
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,111
the shortage of
teachers and resources,

239
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:25,114
the black colleges
in the South survived.

240
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:30,844
They began to produce
their first graduates...

241
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:36,746
many of whom were
formerly enslaved.

242
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:46,929
Anderson: General O.O. Howard,

243
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:49,207
for whom
Howard University is named,

244
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:53,971
he was going around looking at
the plight of African Americans,

245
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,663
and he ran across students,
and he asked,

246
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:58,596
"What shall I tell
the people up North

247
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,013
about the plight
of the former slaves?"

248
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:05,016
And the 13-year-old
Richard Robert Wright rose

249
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,950
and said,
"Tell them we are rising."

250
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,113
"Although I had no
idea where it was

251
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:34,908
or how many miles away,

252
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:38,084
I remember only that
I was on fire constantly

253
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,017
with one ambition,

254
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,329
and that was to go
to Hampton" --

255
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,918
Booker T. Washington.

256
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:48,094
Booker T. Washington
hears about Hampton College,

257
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,647
and he works his way there,

258
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,857
walking across
the state of Virginia.

259
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,344
This is a dedication
to a vision for education.

260
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,863
The Hampton Institute

261
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,349
was founded
by a retired Yankee general

262
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:04,593
named Samuel Armstrong,

263
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:08,355
and his approach was
to teach the trades --

264
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,255
carpentry, laundry work,
farming --

265
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:14,499
to black youths.

266
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:16,812
Samuel Chapman Armstrong
was, without a doubt,

267
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:20,091
someone who believed in the
inferiority of black people,

268
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,575
no question about that.

269
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,474
He didn't believe
that black people were

270
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:30,377
capable of anything more than
an industrial arts education.

271
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,000
He just could not see

272
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:35,589
black people advancing
beyond that.

273
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:38,454
Booker T. Washington --

274
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:40,560
He's really taken in
by Armstrong,

275
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:42,251
becomes his right hand.

276
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:43,563
Armstrong says very clearly

277
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,255
that Washington
is his prize student.

278
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,844
Samuel Armstrong recommended
Booker T. Washington

279
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:51,674
to head the Tuskegee Institute,

280
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,849
making him one of
the few African Americans

281
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:56,990
to run a black college.

282
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,958
When Washington
goes to Tuskegee,

283
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,546
he starts the process
of building

284
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,929
Tuskegee Institute from scratch.

285
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,077
Gasman: It was a campus
dedicated to the idea

286
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:17,045
of industrial education.

287
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:22,843
Booker T. Washington
was, really,

288
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,950
one of the first masters
at marketing.

289
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:32,922
Using photography,

290
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,683
he's trying to communicate,

291
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:37,893
"This is the type of education
that, at Tuskegee,

292
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:41,793
we are giving to
African Americans."

293
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,347
Anderson: It appeals
to the white leaders

294
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:44,796
in the American South.

295
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:47,903
They don't see
pictures of lawyers.

296
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:50,561
They don't see pictures
of politicians.

297
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,045
They don't see pictures
of professionals

298
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,944
who they think they're
too good for hard work.

299
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,949
Medord: I think it was just that
Booker T. Washington felt

300
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:02,435
that black people were not,
at present,

301
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:05,886
capable of doing
anything more than that.

302
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:09,683
And as a consequence
of taking that perspective,

303
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:11,720
black people suffered,

304
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:14,102
so he did
a great deal of damage.

305
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:25,906
Booker T. Washington gave
one of the opening speeches

306
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,944
at the Atlanta Exposition,

307
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,946
and it was
incredibly significant

308
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,914
to have an African American
giving this speech.

309
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:36,331
Before he starts,
there are a lot of catcalls

310
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:37,608
on the part of whites

311
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:40,128
and hissing and so on.

312
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:43,821
"As we have proved our
loyalty to you in the past

313
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,203
in nursing your children,

314
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:50,103
watching by the sick bed
of your mothers and fathers,

315
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:53,831
we shall stand by you ready
to lay down our lives

316
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,629
if need be in defense of yours.

317
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:01,701
In all things that
are purely social,

318
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:05,118
we can be as separate
as the fingers,

319
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:08,811
yet one as the hand
in all things essential

320
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,468
to mutual progress."

321
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:16,888
What he was saying in that
speech to white people,

322
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,236
"We will be your laborers.

323
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,170
We will be the people who will
take care of your children.

324
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:26,450
We will be the people
who will do your menial work."

325
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:29,004
And then he says to black people

326
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,456
that you have to start
at the bottom

327
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,009
and work your way up,

328
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:38,186
and that's where
we were meant to begin.

329
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,396
By the time he finishes,
whites are crying.

330
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,743
white women are throwing
out their handkerchiefs

331
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:46,953
and throwing out
flowers and clapping.

332
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:51,268
They are so moved
by this speech.

333
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:54,892
He makes white people,
North and South, happy.

334
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,307
He makes capitalists

335
00:18:56,342 --> 00:19:00,449
and plantation owners
in the South happy.

336
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:03,314
Everybody is happy 'cause
we now have a black person

337
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,799
who is saying,
"Let's compromise.

338
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:09,009
We won't agitate
for social equality,

339
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:11,805
political participation,
civil rights.

340
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,462
Forget all that stuff."

341
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:19,917
What he seemed to be suggesting
was a kind of neoslavery.

342
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,300
This is coming from
the college president

343
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,474
who happens to be
the most prominent

344
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,443
African American
in the South.

345
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,345
He's a rockstar.

346
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,175
He's a megastar.

347
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,453
This is somebody who is
going to be able

348
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:43,251
to dictate the terms of life
for black education.

349
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:47,082
He becomes the darling
of the white philanthropists.

350
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,567
We're talking about
the Rockefellers,

351
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:52,570
the Carnegies, the Peabodys,

352
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,780
these huge names in the country.

353
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,472
Booker T. Washington appealed

354
00:19:57,506 --> 00:20:00,958
to Northern industrialists
for pragmatic reasons.

355
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:04,720
They were seeking
after a labor force,

356
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:07,827
and he basically offered
the proposition

357
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:11,175
of an educated
black labor force,

358
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,868
but not too educated
and not too pushy.

359
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:17,837
"History is to note
two Washingtons,

360
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,702
one white, the other black,

361
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:23,601
both fathers of their people" --

362
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:25,534
Andrew Carnegie.

363
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:29,089
Holloway: As his ideology
becomes the only ideology,

364
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,333
there's not enough room,
it seems,

365
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:34,371
for lots of different ideas
about how to save the race.

366
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:36,580
That becomes a problem
for other black leaders.

367
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:40,860
They want to have their voice
at the table, as well.

368
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,724
"There is among educated

369
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:43,966
and thoughtful colored men

370
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:46,555
in all parts of the land

371
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,316
a feeling of deep regret,

372
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,938
sorrow, and apprehension

373
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:52,458
at the wide currency
and ascendancy

374
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:55,495
which Mr. Washington's theories
have gained.

375
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,981
Mr. Washington's program
practically accepts

376
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:03,020
the alleged inferiority
of the Negro race" --

377
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,437
W.E.B. Du Bois.

378
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:09,095
W.E.B. Du Bois is, probably,

379
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:12,236
the most educated American,
black or white.

380
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,065
He has gone to Fisk University.

381
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,308
He has gone to Harvard

382
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:18,967
and then studied abroad
in Germany.

383
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:22,177
Du Bois believes with education,
you gain freedom.

384
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:25,007
You gain independence.

385
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:28,356
Du Bois' vision calls
for expensive high education

386
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,806
and for thousands
of African Americans

387
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:33,326
to go to college,
become educated,

388
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,949
and to be fighters
for freedom and equality.

389
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:37,744
Between Washington and Du Bois,

390
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:40,713
they were so fundamentally
different in terms of vision,

391
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:42,059
so fundamentally different

392
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,612
in terms of the purpose
of education,

393
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:46,132
that there was no way
to reconcile the two.

394
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,411
Du Bois: "We refuse to kiss
the hand that smites us,

395
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:53,519
but rather insist on striving
by all civilized methods

396
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:55,935
to gain every
right and privilege

397
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:59,041
open to free
American citizens" --

398
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:01,458
W.E.B. Du Bois.

399
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:03,632
Washington's ideology
begins to fade

400
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,221
the further you get
into the 20th century.

401
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:11,260
The notion of just having
a vocational education system

402
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:14,540
just doesn't make sense
in a changing U.S. society.

403
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:18,854
You see it in all of
the educational institutions

404
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,339
for black folk --

405
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,238
a shift away from
industrial education

406
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:26,621
to higher pursuits
for black people

407
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:31,108
and a new way of thinking
about how American society

408
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,937
ought to function and look.

409
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:40,911
Washington dies in 1915.

410
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:47,676
It is a moment in American
culture and society.

411
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,543
He is one of the last
generations of African Americans

412
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:55,235
born into slavery.

413
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,824
You can read that funeral
as a moment of bearing witness

414
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,136
to a change.

415
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,931
A change is coming.

416
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,317
Wolters: African Americans

417
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,250
loyally supported
the United States

418
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,805
during the First World War,

419
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,808
and then when they returned
to the United States,

420
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:19,881
they were determined to enjoy
a greater degree of democracy.

421
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:31,410
But whites were not prepared
for any changes here.

422
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,382
James: African American
returning veterans

423
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,627
were often beaten
at the train stops

424
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,801
when they arrived.

425
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,078
They were attacked

426
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,184
by their fellow veterans
who were white.

427
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,704
They were attack by civilians.

428
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:54,363
28 cities burned during
the famous Red Summer of 1919.

429
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,988
Although we refer to them
as race riots,

430
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:02,061
they were often small race wars.

431
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:06,306
The black veterans
were shooting back.

432
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:08,205
"Though far outnumbered,

433
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,932
let us show us brave

434
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:13,313
and for their thousand blows

435
00:24:13,348 --> 00:24:16,489
deal one death blow.

436
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:20,148
What though before us
lies the open grave,

437
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:24,117
like men, we'll face
the murderous cowardly pack

438
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:27,327
pressed to the wall, dying,

439
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:28,915
but fighting back."

440
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,491
Holloway: The New Negro
has no fear is a reflection

441
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:55,977
of this changed sensibility.

442
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,565
It's a militant New Negro.

443
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,533
It's one that's going to
stand up for his or her rights

444
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:03,329
after all these black soldiers
had fought for those rights

445
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:05,434
and died for those rights
over in Europe.

446
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,851
And, by God,
they're going to get them.

447
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,646
Black colleges were
an interesting place.

448
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,752
Most of them, during
that period,

449
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:14,478
had white presidents,

450
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,412
and they were run in
a very Draconian kind of way,

451
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:21,278
with moral codes
and with lots of rules.

452
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:24,902
The white presidents were
completely ill equipped

453
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:27,284
as to what to do with
these African Americans

454
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,700
who now wanted to shape
their own destiny

455
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:33,739
and were very spirited
and were defiant.

456
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:44,439
McKenzie,
the Fisk University president,

457
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:47,200
is not the kind of person that
you would have expected

458
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:48,685
to come to Fisk.

459
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,376
He had worked out west

460
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,103
on Shoshone Indian reservations,

461
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:54,656
and he had
an extensive experience

462
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:56,796
with Native American-
white relations.

463
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,454
The board of trustees at Fisk
made no real distinction

464
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:01,042
between working with
Native Americans

465
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:03,251
and working with
African Americans.

466
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:05,115
His white secretary commented

467
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:07,842
that she didn't think
that he understood black people

468
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:11,466
and wasn't even sure
that he liked them.

469
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,469
President McKenzie comes in
with the notion

470
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:17,023
that he can make Fisk
more conservative,

471
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:20,026
that he can take
Fisk University students

472
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,408
and educate them
in a different direction.

473
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:24,790
So he starts to make changes.

474
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:28,138
He wouldn't let them have
any social organizations.

475
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,174
A bell told them
when to get up...

476
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,244
He took away the track team.

477
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,556
when to go to breakfast.

478
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,213
He took away the baseball team.

479
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:35,524
when to to go class.

480
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,526
Men and women could not
walk together.

481
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,632
He would make no compromise.

482
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,221
McKenzie said,
"I am as old-fashioned

483
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,223
as the Ten Commandments,"

484
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:46,259
because he believed that blacks

485
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:49,055
were particularly
sensuous beings

486
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,507
who needed more restraint.

487
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:57,443
What he was afraid of,
I think, was widespread...

488
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:02,931
He was afraid of sex, basically.

489
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:07,418
W.E.B. Du Bois heard about all
this from his daughter, Yolanda,

490
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:10,042
who was a student at Fisk,

491
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:15,979
and then, when Yolanda was
graduating in 1924,

492
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:18,947
Fisk invited Du Bois to speak.

493
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:23,676
"I have come to criticize.

494
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:28,405
In Fisk today,
discipline is choking freedom.

495
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:32,581
Ironclad rules,
suspicion are almost universal.

496
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:35,170
The Negro race needs colleges.

497
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:38,518
We need them today
as never before,

498
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,935
but we do not need
colleges so much

499
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:45,042
that we can sacrifice the ideals
of the Negro race" --

500
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:48,528
W.E.B. Du Bois.

501
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:51,566
Anderson: He's saying
to Fisk students, "Resist.

502
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,189
Resist this repression.

503
00:27:54,224 --> 00:27:57,192
Rise up."

504
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:04,579
The Fisk students had
engaged in a tin-pan riot.

505
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:07,306
Shouts of "Du Bois! Du Bois!"
are heard.

506
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,725
They went about the campus
for a period of an hour or two.

507
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,729
They came back to their beds
and were asleep by 10:00,

508
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:19,042
when it was time
for the lights to go off.

509
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:29,500
Students awoke to find as many
as 80 Metro National Policemen

510
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:32,469
in full riot gear.

511
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,196
They treat the
students as criminals.

512
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,163
They handcuff the students.

513
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:40,201
They immediately place them
into these paddy wagons,

514
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:43,238
and they take them off to jail.

515
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,380
Some claim that
they heard gun shots.

516
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:51,522
Maybe the first shots fired ever
on a historically black campus,

517
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:53,697
but it certainly
wouldn't be the last.

518
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,494
The students were so angry
that they went on strike,

519
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:03,189
and for 10 weeks,
they refused to attend class.

520
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:05,605
The trustees essentially decided

521
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,954
that it was not possible
to continue to have a university

522
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:11,611
if they had no students.

523
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:15,098
"My dear Lambert,
if you have not already learned,

524
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:17,894
I've resigned as president
of Fisk University

525
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:21,276
and, probably, want to return
to the rank of teacher,

526
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:24,486
preferably in
the field of sociology,

527
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,248
including race relations.

528
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:30,941
Very truly yours,
Fayette McKenzie."

529
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:33,875
It's a victory because it
makes national headlines,

530
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,981
and students at other
black universities

531
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:38,121
across the country
are emboldened.

532
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:39,570
They are inspired.

533
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:42,332
They participate
in their own protests

534
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,058
in the weeks
and in the months and years

535
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:45,749
that followed the Fisk fight.

536
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,684
It shows that the modern
new Negro student, right,

537
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:51,168
it will no longer stand

538
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:55,414
for the Victorian atmosphere
of their predecessors.

539
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,941
Let black people understand

540
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,287
that they are the lovers

541
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:09,566
and the sons of warriors.

542
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,293
Let the world be a black poem,

543
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:18,023
and let all black people speak
this poem silently or loud.

544
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:27,066
♪ School days ♪

545
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,343

00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,759

♪ You, my girl, in Calico ♪

550
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:41,460
In high school,
I was a good student.

551
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,048
That's why I guess the principle

552
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:45,844
is recommending me
to Wilson College.

553
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:49,295
The disappointment comes
when that person comes

554
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,333
from the college,
to interview me,

555
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,680
and then it was all downhill.

556
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:57,372
I have not forgotten
her words --

557
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:58,822
"Your grades are wonderful,

558
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,720
but we're a little concerned

559
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:03,551
because we don't know
with whom...

560
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:05,864
you would be paired

561
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:10,420
because we cater to a lot
of Southern gentlewomen,

562
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,594
and they room in suites.

563
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:14,424
Sorry, kid."

564
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,703
So I didn't get to Wilson.

565
00:31:17,737 --> 00:31:20,809
I applied to Bennett
for a scholarship.

566
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:23,536
It was kind of special,
you know.

567
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:24,813
You kind of stick
your chest out.

568
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:28,507
I'm a Bennett gal.

569
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,233
During the 1930s and '40s,

570
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,752
black colleges are really
the only place that

571
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:35,652
an African-American student
can go,

572
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,103
and this created
this enormous incubator

573
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:40,070
for success and intellectual

574
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:42,659
thought and creativity.

575
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:46,766
The best and brightest
is going to black colleges.

576
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:49,252
These professors
were on a mission,

577
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:51,910
not just, say,
to teach classics

578
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,809
or French literature
or political science.

579
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:58,709
They are there to ensure
a vibrant black future.

580
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,159
They're going to encourage you

581
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:03,266
because they recognize
your full human capability

582
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,165
and possibility.

583
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,687
If a teacher saw you kind
of slipping or faltering,

584
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:14,415
there was a, "What's going on?

585
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:17,970
What's the matter?
Can I help?"

586
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,076
There was a watching over you

587
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,494
to see that you did
the best that you could.

588
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:27,497
Black colleges were
educating future doctors

589
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,809
and future lawyers
and future teachers

590
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:33,089
and nurses and judges,

591
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:35,850
and they were responsible
for lifting

592
00:32:35,884 --> 00:32:38,853
African-Americans
out of poverty,

593
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:41,580
and they started to create
the black middle class

594
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:43,478
as we know it.

595
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:52,142
For a black child,

596
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:55,939
every teacher that you knew had
gone to a black college.

597
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,149
Every lawyer that you knew had
gone to a black college.

598
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:00,323
Every medical doctor

599
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:02,911
that treated you had gone
to a black college.

600
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:05,086
Black colleges were redefining

601
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,950
what it meant to be black
in America.

602
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,470
You weren't doing something
with your hands.

603
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,230
You were pursuing a career,

604
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:16,201
where education
and intellect mattered.

605
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:18,479
Black people were in charge.

606
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:20,515
Black people were in control.

607
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,001
Black people were
writing the checks.

608
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,312
I went out for the football team
when I got there

609
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:01,177
because the girls liked you.

610
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:05,146
They would really go for you
if you played football.

611
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:07,907
You'd get back at halftime,
and they'd call you, tell you,

612
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:10,462
"Listen! We're not playing
for no girls or nothing.

613
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,740
We're playing football.
We're playing to win.

614
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:15,432
Do you understand?"

615
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:20,610
Going to college was the best
decision that I ever made.

616
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,545
Anderson: There was
a football game.

617
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,788
It's not just
about the students.

618
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:29,929
It's really about
the whole state.

619
00:34:29,964 --> 00:34:31,862
The whole communities
are engulfed

620
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:34,348
by those institutions.

621
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:39,698
This is the era of fraternities
and sororities.

622
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:43,322
You have a rich social
and cultural life.

623
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:04,102
We met in the registrar's office
at Fisk University.

624
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:08,865
I was in line to speak
to the registrar.

625
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,764
There was that young,
beautiful person

626
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,559
at the typewriter,
typing,

627
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:18,046
and it seemed as though
she was looking over toward me.

628
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:21,153
Something causes her
to bat her eye.

629
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:24,708
I got up to help him,
and he said,

630
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:27,194
"Did you wink at me?"

631
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:30,128
And I just kind of
smiled and...

632
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:33,890
That was enough of an invitation
for me to ask her out.

633
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,582
♪ I'll buy you a diamond ♪

634
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:39,482
♪ I'll buy you a diamond ring ♪

635
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:44,176
68 years ago,
we married.

636
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:46,730
It was a protective,
insulated environment

637
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:47,904
where they could talk.

638
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,492
They could exchange ideas.

639
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:50,769
They could be themselves,

640
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:52,184
and, at least,
for that time period,

641
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,048
for those moments,
they didn't have to deal

642
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:59,433
squarely with segregation
and inequality.

643
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,780
Once they left campus,
they were right back

644
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:04,921
into the kind of segregation,

645
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,888
the kind of humiliation,

646
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:09,857
and so it was a special place.

647
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:13,412
I don't recall it
crossing my mind.

648
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,000
There were some place
where you knew

649
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:18,106
you weren't supposed to go,
so you didn't go.

650
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:21,075
We didn't talk about it,
you know?

651
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:26,114
You just kind of accepted things
the way they were.

652
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:40,128
The plan to change
racial segregation

653
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:44,063
could only have found its seed

654
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:47,377
and borne fruit at
a black college,

655
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,172
like Howard University.

656
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,105
They had a commitment
around these issues

657
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,901
that even well-meaning
liberal whites

658
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:58,492
and white institutions
would not have developed.

659
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:01,978
This is an idea that
was cultivated and navigated

660
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,773
by black professors

661
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:07,466
and deans and black students.

662
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,365
This radical change,

663
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:13,127
I would think this affirmation
of the American ideal,

664
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:17,027
comes out of a black college
and black university.

665
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:30,731
With impressive
open-air ceremonies,

666
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,802
Howard University
of Washington, D.C.,

667
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,253
graduates several hundred.

668
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:40,465
The crowd listens avidly
to Johnson, president of Howard.

669
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:43,468
James: Mordecai Johnson was
the first black president

670
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:45,297
of Howard University.

671
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,299
He was going to, if he could,

672
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:51,441
try to work a revolution
of the Howard Law School.

673
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:55,997
And so Mordecai Johnson hires
Charles Hamilton Houston,

674
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:58,586
who, at the time,
is almost certainly the most

675
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:01,693
highly-educated African-American
lawyer in history --

676
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:03,177
graduate of Harvard Law School,

677
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:07,077
the first black member
of the Harvard Law Review.

678
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:09,045
Holloway: Houston had a plan
for this law school.

679
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,978
He's going to make it
a first-rate law school

680
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:14,844
that is all about breaking down
a whole system

681
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,812
of racial discrimination
and segregation.

682
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:21,989
That's what the Howard Law
School mission is going to be.

683
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:25,061
Howard Law School, at the time,
is an unaccredited law school.

684
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,029
It is almost entirely
a night school,

685
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:30,929
and many of its students
attend part-time

686
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:33,656
because they have to work.

687
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,174
It was referred to derisively

688
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:38,626
by some African-African
attorneys in Washington

689
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:41,353
as a dummy's retreat.

690
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:45,599
In 1930, Houston closes
the night school.

691
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:48,740
There is outcry among
the African-American lawyers,

692
00:38:48,774 --> 00:38:53,227
not just in Washington, D.C.,
but nationwide.

693
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:57,473
They said this man is trying
to Harvard-ize Howard.

694
00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:59,682
Enrollment plummets,

695
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:01,615
all the white professors quit.

696
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:04,480
They wanted to work
at their day-jobs.

697
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:07,552
This allowed Houston
to hire new faculty.

698
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:10,278
Now we've got
an all-black faculty,

699
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:11,970
and they're some
of the finest attorneys

700
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:14,386
who were working
in Washington, D.C.

701
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:17,078
Marshall:
Dean Charles H. Houston --

702
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:19,943
He used to tell us
in our first year

703
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:21,566
to look at the man
on your right,

704
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,500
and look at the man
on your left,

705
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:28,573
and bear in mind that two
of you will be here next year.

706
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:32,231
That sort of kept your feet
to the fire.

707
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:37,789
Thurgood Marshall was a
graduate of Lincoln University,

708
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:41,379
a black college where he was not
an exceptional student,

709
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,381
and, by all accounts,
this was from general

710
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,418
lack of interest in his studies.

711
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:48,558
Thurgood Marshall
was widely regarded

712
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:52,390
to be someone
who had a big personality,

713
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:56,290
and someone who could
persuade people by charm.

714
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:57,740
These are some of
the raw skills

715
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:00,812
that Charles Hamilton Houston
took and refined

716
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:02,296
and turned into one of

717
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,609
the most significant lawyers

718
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,783
of our generation.

719
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:09,199
Shortly after Thurgood
Marshall graduates

720
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:11,098
from Howard Law School,

721
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:15,309
he and Dean Houston
take a road trip,

722
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:19,037
and they head into the recesses
of the deep South.

723
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,288
They are charged by the NAACP

724
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:32,188
with documenting the conditions

725
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,224
in which black children

726
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:37,435
go to school
in the southern states.

727
00:40:40,368 --> 00:40:42,267
Charles Hamilton Houston
was a big techie.

728
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:43,475
Anything that came out,

729
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,683
the new technology
that came out,

730
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:46,202
he wanted to have it,

731
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,791
and in Charles Hamilton
Houston's car,

732
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:50,965
they have a typewriter,

733
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,693
a camera, and a film camera.

734
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:10,088
This was their first exposure

735
00:41:10,122 --> 00:41:12,021
to the conditions

736
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,332
deep in Georgia,

737
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:16,301
in Northern Florida,
and Alabama.

738
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:18,510
They had not seen that before.

739
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:28,313
Houston and Marshall
were able to film

740
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:32,766
white students on the buses
going to school.

741
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,532
And then they were
able to contrast that

742
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:44,398
by showing black students
walking to school.

743
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,955
There were not bathrooms.

744
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,787
There were not even outhouses
at some of these buildings.

745
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:01,001
Houston and Marshall
brought the film

746
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,485
back from the deep South

747
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,352
to NAACP Headquarters
in New York City.

748
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:09,527
The Constitution says that

749
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,390
the separation of the races
is okay

750
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:13,841
as long as that separation
is equal.

751
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:16,879
Houston has a plan.
It's an incredibly bold plan.

752
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:22,574
He's gonna attack segregation,
ironically, by supporting it.

753
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:25,301
So the strategy
that Houston devised

754
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,785
was that he was going to argue

755
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,581
that they needed to enforce
separate but equal,

756
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:34,034
by forcing the states to
actually make their facilities

757
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,692
that were already
separate equal.

758
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:41,593
In reality, it was impossible
to actually maintain

759
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,491
equal schools
that were separate.

760
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:46,943
It would be way too expensive.

761
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:48,600
The brilliant thing that

762
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:50,429
Charles Hamilton Houston
set in motion

763
00:42:50,464 --> 00:42:55,158
was this was not going
to be a one-game struggle.

764
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:58,265
This wasn't going
to be a one case.

765
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:01,302
The idea was to build
a steady drumbeat

766
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:04,064
from one state to another,

767
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:06,273
establishing the principle

768
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:09,552
that separate was never equal.

769
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:14,177
Operating our educational system

770
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:17,008
is one of government's
most important jobs

771
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,630
because education is one thing

772
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:22,392
Oklahomans have
always believed in.

773
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:25,430
George McLaurin,
he was a 68-year-old teacher

774
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:26,983
with a master's degree.

775
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,296
He sought a PhD in education

776
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,747
at the University of Oklahoma.

777
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:34,508
University of Oklahoma
admitted him,

778
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:39,755
but they forced him to sit
outside the classroom.

779
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:43,862
Oklahoma was like,
"Okay, so this is equal,

780
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:45,105
but it's separate.

781
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:47,072
You said that
we could do separate

782
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:48,349
as long as it was equal.

783
00:43:48,384 --> 00:43:51,490
So how about that?"
How about that?

784
00:43:51,525 --> 00:43:55,356
Here we had a student who was
attending the same school,

785
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:58,981
hearing the same lecture
at the same time

786
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:01,880
as the white students,

787
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:06,436
but was sent aside,

788
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:11,372
stigmatized because
of his race.

789
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:12,822
He's not able to interact

790
00:44:12,857 --> 00:44:13,996
with his fellow students.

791
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,310
He's not able to interact
with his professors.

792
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:20,140
This is clearly a circumstance

793
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:22,556
in which the separation itself,

794
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,215
even under conditions where
they're getting ostensibly

795
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:29,563
the same education
is not equal,

796
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:31,220
and that was, in fact,

797
00:44:31,254 --> 00:44:33,774
a breakthrough moment
to be able to say,

798
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:38,952
"Segregation in and of itself
is an inequality."

799
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:45,579
Charles Hamilton
Houston died in 1950,

800
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:48,686
but his campaign that started
some 20 years earlier

801
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,138
at Howard Law School
came to fruition in 1954.

802
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:57,729
This is the group of lawyers
from all sections of the country

803
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:59,627
who are here
in the Supreme Court

804
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:04,287
for the purpose of arguing
the school segregation cases,

805
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:06,738
and we believe that
the proper place

806
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:10,673
for the issue of segregation
is in a court.

807
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:16,196
100 years after laws existed

808
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,198
that prevented African-Americans

809
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:19,613
from learning how to read,

810
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,753
it prevented white Americans

811
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:25,067
from teaching African-Americans
how to read --

812
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,620
100 years after that,

813
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:29,692
we have an integrated team
of lawyers,

814
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,143
led by an African-American,

815
00:45:32,177 --> 00:45:35,111
arguing for the Supreme Court
of the United States

816
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:38,666
that separate but equal
is unconstitutional

817
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:42,878
in the field
of public education.

818
00:45:42,912 --> 00:45:45,984
Crenshaw: The game changer
in the 20th century was

819
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:48,400
Brown v. Board of Education.

820
00:45:48,435 --> 00:45:51,714
It took lawyers not
at an elite school

821
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,235
but at a law school
that was put together

822
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:58,238
by spit and glue and hard work

823
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:00,792
that that would be the space

824
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:03,381
that would create
a legal revolution

825
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:07,557
that all Americans
now benefit from.

826
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:10,595
This is an educational
institution at it's best,

827
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:14,668
not just creating knowledge
for the sake of having it,

828
00:46:14,702 --> 00:46:18,120
but creating knowledge in order
to do something concrete

829
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:19,915
with that knowledge.

830
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,817
That's what Howard Law School
represents.

831
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:32,548
The decision opened the way
toward eliminating

832
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,689
racial discrimination
from American life,

833
00:46:35,723 --> 00:46:39,037
but it did not bring into
reality immediate integration.

834
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:40,625
More than laws are required

835
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:43,973
to change long-established
attitudes and institutions.

836
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:46,907
I say that we will fight
to the last ditch

837
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:50,808
to prevent unwanted integration
against our great people.

838
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,879
You've got to keep the white
and the black separate.

839
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:55,226
We are determined, in Georgia...

840
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,434
As governor of the state
of Alabama...

841
00:46:56,468 --> 00:46:58,470
we will maintain
separate schools

842
00:46:58,505 --> 00:46:59,851
for the white
and the colored races.

843
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:02,750
What happens
to a dream deferred?

844
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:05,132
We don't want the niggers
going in this school.

845
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:06,754
It's a white school.

846
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:09,585
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?

847
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,036
I think they should kept out
any way possible.

848
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,315
Or fester like a sore
and then run?

849
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:16,730
I think they should be separate.

850
00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:20,113
Even the animals
choose their own breed.

851
00:47:20,147 --> 00:47:23,841
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.

852
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:27,120
I'm for segregation
because it's biblical.

853
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:29,260
Or does it explode?

854
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:41,548
There was a famous man
who once said

855
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:42,860
"There's nothing
on Earth so powerful

856
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:45,759
as an idea who's time has come."

857
00:47:45,793 --> 00:47:49,901
and I think the centuries of
discrimination and segregation

858
00:47:49,936 --> 00:47:53,491
and ill treatment
and the lynchings,

859
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:55,907
I think the time had come

860
00:47:55,942 --> 00:48:00,118
for the war to be waged
to end segregation.

861
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:02,155
We wanted freedom now...

862
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:04,295
not 25 years from now.

863
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,541
It was, "Damn it.

864
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:10,922
Are we going to keep talking,

865
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:13,476
or are we going to take action.

866
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:15,582
If not us, who?"

867
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,722
Nobody was doing anything.

868
00:48:17,756 --> 00:48:19,827
There was no protest.

869
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:22,071
We decided we would sit in.

870
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:30,493
McCain: We came into this store

871
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:33,151
and sat in at the lunch counter,

872
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:36,775
which was not customary
or accepted

873
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,537
for African-Americans
at the time.

874
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:47,890
The New York Times
had this story on four students

875
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:53,033
who had actually sat in
at a Woolworth's store,

876
00:48:53,068 --> 00:48:56,519
and that was absolutely
earthshaking.

877
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:59,350
Every one of us knew full well

878
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:01,628
that they were either

879
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:03,423
the bravest people in the world

880
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:06,219
or the craziest people
in the world.

881
00:49:06,253 --> 00:49:10,154
McNeil: We sat for pretty close
to two hours.

882
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:11,776
The store manager said,

883
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,364
"You boys are going to
get in a lot of trouble.

884
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:16,229
I'm going to call the cops
if you don't get up and leave.

885
00:49:16,263 --> 00:49:18,334
We can't serve you here.

886
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:20,612
We won'tserve you here."

887
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:22,407
So we sat until
the store manager

888
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:26,584
decided to close the lunchroom
for the rest of the day.

889
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:28,103
You know, why did you
fellows select

890
00:49:28,137 --> 00:49:30,691
the five-and-dime
variety store lunch counters?

891
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:32,486
Why didn't you just walk
into a restaurant

892
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:33,901
if you wanted
to prove your point?

893
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:36,007
Woolworth's is open
to the public.

894
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:37,905
They should have
equal facilities,

895
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,634
not only restroom facilities,
but these facilities also.

896
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:46,155
A photographer from
the Associated Press,

897
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,846
Jack Moebes,

898
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,297
greeted us at the door.

899
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:52,851
He says, "You coming back?"

900
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,992
Well, we said, "Yes.
We're going to be back tomorrow,

901
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,476
and we're going
to keep coming back

902
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,512
until you guys serve us."

903
00:49:58,547 --> 00:50:01,136
♪ Black and white together ♪

904
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,621
The Bennett girls became aware

905
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:05,485
of what we were doing
at the A&T,

906
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,902
and they couldn't be held
on the sidelines.

907
00:50:08,936 --> 00:50:11,353
And so they joined it.

908
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:12,733
We deserve our rights,

909
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:16,220
and we are going to get them
one way or the other.

910
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:20,396
This was an opportunity
to make a difference,

911
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:22,433
We felt it was
incumbent upon us

912
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:23,813
because we were young people.

913
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:25,919
We were students,
and we had a responsibility,

914
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:27,783
and we were going to be
the future leaders,

915
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,993
so now was a good time
to begin to demonstrate

916
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,790
what good leaders
we could become.

917
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:37,172
Well, we started out
the first day with four,

918
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:39,691
the second day, 16,

919
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:42,108
the third day, 24,

920
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:43,799
then at 64,

921
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,835
then that Saturday occurred.

922
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:49,391
We had pretty close
to 1,000 students

923
00:50:49,425 --> 00:50:51,565
demonstrating peacefully,

924
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,671
and it kept growing

925
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:58,124
until this thing just had
a life of its own.

926
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:02,335
Parham: It was being replicated
throughout the South,

927
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:06,960
and largely among
black college students.

928
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:10,170

of the city's two
largest department stores

934

935
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,397
and for the first time,

936
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:33,780
the community was confronted
with Negroes in places

937
00:51:33,814 --> 00:51:36,541

946
00:51:57,804 --> 00:51:59,599
because you were students.

947
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:01,980
It was just a matter of,

reading this chapter
or whatever you had to do

949
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:07,331
before you got back
on the picket line.

950
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,749
During the weeks
after the sit-ins began,

951
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:13,371
opposition in
the white communities

952
00:52:13,406 --> 00:52:15,201
of the South solidified,

953
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:18,065
and the first signs
of violence appeared.

954
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,317
We were called niggers.

955
00:52:28,352 --> 00:52:30,181
We were spat on.

956
00:52:30,216 --> 00:52:32,321
People came by
and threw cigarettes at you.

957
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:36,601
It was very difficult
not to fight back.

958
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:40,778
I spent a lot of time
on that picket line, crying,

959

Rich's Department Store
was the big kahuna.

985
00:53:59,063 --> 00:54:01,272
They had stores
all over the South.

986
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:03,516
Dick Rich, who was the president
of Rich's at the time,

987
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,277
he told me that
if I brought my black ass

988
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:11,317
back into his store again,
he was going to put me in jail,

989
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,802
and I told him that,
"I'm coming back, Mr. Rich,

990
00:54:13,836 --> 00:54:15,286
and I'm bringing thousands
with me,

991
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:18,531
and get your jails ready
because we going to be there."

992
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:20,740
Taitt-Magubane: We synchronized
watches and said,

993
00:54:20,774 --> 00:54:25,020
"At 11:15, everyone was to enter

994
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,436
wherever they were assigned to."

995
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:32,476
It meant that they had to deal
with all of us at the same time.

996
00:54:34,581 --> 00:54:37,101
King: We were able to cost
Rich's Department Store,

997
00:54:37,135 --> 00:54:39,552
in 1960,
over the Christmas holidays,

998
00:54:39,586 --> 00:54:44,108
$10 million in losses.

999
00:54:44,142 --> 00:54:46,386
All of a sudden,
they wanted to talk,

1000
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:49,355
and within six weeks,
they had signed an agreement

1001
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:52,427

1006
00:55:07,165 --> 00:55:10,445
I thought it was by far
one of the lousiest meals

1007
00:55:10,479 --> 00:55:11,825

They've been already trying

in the context of America,

1031
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:31,077
that's what he has to decide,
"Who am I?"

1032
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:33,148

1033

then he knows

1034
00:56:35,461 --> 00:56:38,291
Crenshaw: A lot of the conflict
that's starting to happen is

1035
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:40,880
between the students
and the administrators,

1036
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:43,330
students
and the boards of trustees.

1037
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:45,712
They're wanting to see
themselves far more

1038
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:47,196
than they have in the past.

1039
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:49,302
And so that makes

The present administration

1042
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:55,688
are the children
of last generation.

1043
00:56:55,722 --> 00:56:57,897
We're the men and the women
of this generation,

1044
00:56:57,931 --> 00:56:59,726
and the generations to come.

1045
00:56:59,761 --> 00:57:02,557
Either they'll come with us
or be left behind.

1046
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:04,628
Most likely,
they'll be left behind.

1047
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:07,769
About 1,000 students here,
at Howard University,

1048
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:11,531
have sat in and held control of
this administration building.

1049
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:12,739
There are no classes.

1050
00:57:12,774 --> 00:57:15,708
The entire educational system
is shut down.

1051
00:57:15,742 --> 00:57:20,575
Many of us will stay in
the administration building

1052
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:21,852
and be arrested.

1053
00:57:21,886 --> 00:57:25,580
There will be boycotts
until there is progress,

1054
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:29,653
and we are prepared
to boycott until infinity.

1055
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:33,657
It appears to me
that the attitudes

1056
00:57:33,691 --> 00:57:36,487
on the part
of the students suggest

1057
00:57:36,522 --> 00:57:40,387
that an explosion among them
is imminent.

1058
00:57:40,422 --> 00:57:42,355
And the question here
before us is, like,

1059
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:44,357
who going to control
our education,

1060
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:46,014
whether we going to let
white folks control

1061
00:57:46,048 --> 00:57:47,360
it or black people,

1062
00:57:47,394 --> 00:57:48,775
and the students at
Voorhees College

1063
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,777
have taken a position
that black people going

1064
00:57:50,812 --> 00:57:52,089
to control our education.

1065
00:57:52,123 --> 00:57:54,091
You also start to see

1066
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:57,197
the police being more vile
in their approach

1067
00:57:57,232 --> 00:58:00,615
to interacting with students.

1068
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:02,789
President Nixon has urged
college officials

1069
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:05,689
to be firm in dealing
with campus disorder,

1070
00:58:05,723 --> 00:58:07,311
and that's what
Dr. Potts was doing

1071
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:10,245
when he agreed to the use
of the National Guard.

1072
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,972
Black colleges were
particularly vulnerable

1073
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:14,525
to police invasion

1074
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,840
because white politicians
were quick to call in the police

1075
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:22,878
and quick to look the other way
when police used deadly force.

1076
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:24,259
When the bullets
were hitting the walls,

1077
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,123
I was on the floor,

1078
00:58:26,157 --> 00:58:28,021
and there were a lot of people
on top of me,

1079
00:58:28,056 --> 00:58:29,644
and I don't know
what was happening.

1080
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:31,818
All I know, I could just hear
the pounding against the windows

1081
00:58:31,853 --> 00:58:34,165
and glass popping everywhere.

1082
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:40,620
Biondi: This kind of atmosphere
of policing and of crackdown

1083
00:58:40,655 --> 00:58:43,589
made students very,
very vulnerable.

1084
00:58:58,293 --> 00:59:01,365
I entered Southern University
in 1970.

1085
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:06,888
Earth, Wind & Fire,
Barry White, Shaft --

1086
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:08,614
That was the kind of music
we listened to.

1087
00:59:08,648 --> 00:59:10,581
Platform shoes
were in style, too.

1088
00:59:10,616 --> 00:59:13,446
Platform shoes
and bell bottoms.

1089
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,656
I hurt my feet,
and I had a head full of hair.

1090
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:21,212
We was wearing afros.

1091
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:23,180
We wore the little mini dresses.

1092
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:25,182
We all had the little,
small figures

1093
00:59:25,216 --> 00:59:27,494
so it looked good on us.

1094
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:30,152
My sister and my brother
had already entered

1095
00:59:30,187 --> 00:59:31,395
Southern University,

1096
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:33,984
so I knew I should be next.

1097
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:38,022
We wanted to go to Southern,
the black college.

1098
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:43,614
I got on Southern's campus,

1099
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:45,892
and there was, like,
10,000 students on campus,

1100
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:49,137
and there were people
from Seattle, New York,

1101
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:52,830
Chicago, Houston, Texas,
all these places --

1102
00:59:52,865 --> 00:59:54,625
It was amazing.

1103
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,455
The mix of people
was one of the elements

1104
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,492
that defined Southern.

1105
00:59:59,526 --> 01:00:02,357
It was an intellectual
and scholarly oasis that

1106
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,946
I really, really wanted
to be a part of,

1107
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,638
and all of it was there.

1108
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:10,572
Southern University in
Louisiana was the largest

1109
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,817
public black college
in the United States.

1110
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:17,303
There was a black president
and black administrators,

1111
01:00:17,337 --> 01:00:19,374
but it was under the control

1112
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:22,757
of the white elected officials
in Louisiana,

1113
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:25,760
who only spent half
as much per pupil

1114
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:30,488
as they did on
the predominantly white LSU.

1115
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:32,663
My third or fourth week,

1116
01:00:32,698 --> 01:00:34,941
you could see that something
else was happening on campus.

1117
01:00:34,976 --> 01:00:37,599
You getting another vibe
that there was some students

1118
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,602
that weren't happy
with what was going on.

1119
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,811
They want to teach everything
the white-man way.

1120
01:00:42,846 --> 01:00:45,055
We're trying to break away
from this thing, you see.

1121
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:48,472
Too long we've been listening
to white people and their ways.

1122
01:00:48,506 --> 01:00:50,405
We're developing our own ideas,

1123
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:52,579
and we want adequate facilities

1124
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:54,409
to be able to put them
into action.

1125
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:56,929
We didn't feel that
we had enough professors.

1126
01:00:56,963 --> 01:00:58,309
Adequate classroom space.

1127
01:00:58,344 --> 01:00:59,379
Better funded.

1128
01:00:59,414 --> 01:01:01,347
More input into the curriculum.

1129
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:03,936
And it started to build,
and it started to build.

1130
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,524
And so we decided that
the best thing to do

1131
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,803
was a very direct thing
and take this,

1132
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:13,290
these matters, directly
to President Netterville.

1133
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:15,430
Met with him,
and we thought that his response

1134
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:17,432
was not a positive one,

1135
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,953
and so we decided
to boycott classes.

1136
01:01:20,987 --> 01:01:23,887
We will not go back to class
until all of our demands

1137
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:25,889
are met.

1138
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:27,856
Power comes through unity.

1139
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:30,031
Students at Southern
University's campuses

1140
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:31,722
in Baton Rouge and New Orleans

1141
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:34,311
began a series of marches
and demonstrations,

1142
01:01:34,345 --> 01:01:36,589
demanding the resignation
of the school's president

1143
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:39,454
and control over
the administration.

1144
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,629
For an entire month,
we boycotted classes,

1145
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:44,977
and that had never been done.

1146
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:48,601
Southern had a major
football tradition.

1147
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:53,468
We knew that we could
have some impact

1148
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,366
if we drew the attention

1149
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:57,368
of people who attended
these games.

1150
01:01:57,403 --> 01:02:00,578
There were demonstrators
who went onto the football field

1151
01:02:00,613 --> 01:02:03,133
and stopped a football game.

1152
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:04,686
That's when I was impressed.

1153
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,102
I said, "This is really big.

1154
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,484
Maybe the administration
is going to listen to them,

1155
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,589
and something great
is going to happen here."

1156
01:02:11,624 --> 01:02:14,454
When they take the attitude
that they would walk out classes

1157
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:17,526
unless they get their way
completely and instantly,

1158
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:19,563
then it just becomes necessary
to let it be known

1159
01:02:19,597 --> 01:02:21,945
that that just cannot happen.

1160
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:24,671
The call was go and
stand on campus,

1161
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:28,641
stand around all day in uniform
in a show of force,

1162
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:31,886
on the parking lots
and ride through the campus.

1163
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:35,682
We started trailing
the students around

1164
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:37,098
to see where they were going

1165
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:39,790
or where they were holding
meetings off campus.

1166
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:43,242
Everybody was on standby
in a high-alert situation.

1167
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:45,382
Nobody knew what was
going to happen.

1168
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:47,487
Well, of course,
I was not going to sit by

1169
01:02:47,522 --> 01:02:50,628
and allow them or anybody
to destroy public property

1170
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:52,699
that didn't belong
to the students.

1171
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:54,805
It belonged to the people
of the state.

1172
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,670
And while I sympathized
with their complaints

1173
01:02:57,704 --> 01:02:59,568
and was willing
to address them,

1174
01:02:59,603 --> 01:03:00,880
I was not going to allow them

1175
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:04,366
to destroy the university
or its buildings.

1176
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:08,957
The student movement was,
indeed, a nonviolent movement.

1177
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:10,717
There was not one incident

1178
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:13,479
during that entire
period of time

1179
01:03:13,513 --> 01:03:14,825
that represented any violence,

1180
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,379
certainly any violence
on the part of students.

1181
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:28,459
At about somewheres between

1182
01:03:28,494 --> 01:03:30,185
2:00 and 3:00 in the morning,

1183
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,843
I received a knock on my door,

1184
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:34,707
which turned out to be
the police,

1185
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:38,504
and they handed me
a warrant for my arrest.

1186
01:03:38,538 --> 01:03:40,851
I was scared.
I had never been to jail before.

1187
01:03:40,886 --> 01:03:43,474
I didn't know what to expect.

1188
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:45,649
On the morning
of November 16th,

1189
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:48,445
there were no police around.

1190
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,896
It was a very serene day
on campus.

1191
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:53,450
We did what we were
doing every day,

1192
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:55,279
and that is that we were
rallying students

1193
01:03:55,314 --> 01:03:56,729
to leave the class.

1194
01:03:56,763 --> 01:03:58,973
Just that this day,
we informed them

1195
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:01,458
that these four students
had been arrested

1196
01:04:01,492 --> 01:04:02,735
and that we were gonna go over

1197
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:04,392
to President Netterville's
office

1198
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:06,463
and ask him to go downtown

1199
01:04:06,497 --> 01:04:08,603
and get the students
out of jail.

1200
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,985
He let us in his office,
and he said, "Yes,"

1201
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:13,470
he will indeed do that,
and he said,

1202
01:04:13,504 --> 01:04:16,645
"You can stay here
until I return."

1203
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,199
So we took him at his word.

1204
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:19,752
He left the building.

1205
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:23,031
The call that the sheriff's
office received

1206
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:25,723
and who made the call
from Southern University,

1207
01:04:25,758 --> 01:04:28,899
I don't know, but it informed us

1208
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:32,144
that Dr. Netterville
was being held hostage,

1209
01:04:32,178 --> 01:04:34,318
and he was in the
administration building

1210
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:36,769
that had been taken over
by the students,

1211
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:40,290
and we was ordered
to free the hostage.

1212
01:04:40,324 --> 01:04:42,257
We heard this noise outside

1213
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:43,707
and looked out the window.

1214
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:45,847
About 300 sheriff's
office deputies

1215
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,229
and state police troopers
assembled on campus

1216
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:51,888
to carry out Governor Edwards'
demand that order be maintained.

1217
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,545
We immediately knew
that Netterville

1218
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,927
had betrayed us.

1219
01:04:56,962 --> 01:05:00,551
M16s, shotguns, side arms --

1220
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:02,036
You name it, they had it.

1221
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,900
To our amazement,

1222
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:06,488
there was a tank with them.

1223
01:05:06,523 --> 01:05:07,627
Big Bertha, they called it.

1224
01:05:07,662 --> 01:05:08,974
It was a big blue armored

1225
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:10,976
personnel carrier
built out of steel.

1226
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,461
It was there, in the front of
the administration building,

1227
01:05:13,495 --> 01:05:14,565
parked.

1228
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,153
This thing was frightening.

1229
01:05:16,188 --> 01:05:18,259
We about to go to war?

1230
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:21,607
Honore: We had every deputy
that could have a uniform on.

1231
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:23,505
Some of them was new.

1232
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,817
Some of them was reserve.

1233
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:27,544
A lot of them wasn't trained.

1234
01:05:27,578 --> 01:05:29,960
Nobody knew what was
going to happen,

1235
01:05:29,995 --> 01:05:32,859
and a state police --
I was looking right at him --

1236
01:05:32,894 --> 01:05:36,622
leaned down and rolled
a tear gas canister

1237
01:05:36,656 --> 01:05:40,281
towards the crowd.

1238
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:41,972
There was a Bobby Crow,

1239
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:44,009
was the state police,
state trooper.

1240
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:46,356
That was who rolled it.
I was looking right at him.

1241
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:50,429
One of the students leaned down
and picked it up,

1242
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:53,984
hurled it back over
to the deputies.

1243
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:55,434
That's when hell broke loose.

1244
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:03,683
Pandemonium, chaos --

1245
01:06:03,718 --> 01:06:07,170
It was something
that was quite surreal.

1246
01:06:07,204 --> 01:06:10,897
Big Bertha had some
portholes on the side of it,

1247
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:14,487
and shots were
coming out of there rapidly.

1248
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:18,836
You could see it rocking
from the vibrations

1249
01:06:18,871 --> 01:06:21,425
from shots being fired.

1250
01:06:28,294 --> 01:06:31,884
There were two people
left on the ground.

1251
01:06:31,918 --> 01:06:34,266
I thought that they had
been knocked down

1252
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,165
by the rush of students
trying to get away.

1253
01:06:38,822 --> 01:06:41,618
But then I remember
this girl turning around

1254
01:06:41,652 --> 01:06:43,516
and started screaming.

1255
01:07:02,777 --> 01:07:05,435
Coming out of the
administration building,

1256
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:06,953
what I noticed,
and what I'm sure

1257
01:07:06,988 --> 01:07:09,163
a lot of other people noticed,
was a pool of blood

1258
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:11,579
with what looked like
brain matter

1259
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:14,133
floating around in it.

1260
01:07:14,168 --> 01:07:15,652
We came out.

1261
01:07:15,686 --> 01:07:17,378
By that time,
the bodies was gone,

1262
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:21,140
but we saw the markers
and the blood everywhere.

1263
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:25,420
And we were weeping and crying
and going back to the dump.

1264
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,251
They say, "You know that
was your brother, huh?"

1265
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:31,599
I said, "What?"

1266
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:33,083
I went numb.

1267
01:07:33,118 --> 01:07:34,878
There has been trouble
at Southern University

1268
01:07:34,912 --> 01:07:36,811
between black students
and authorities

1269
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:41,195
for a couple of weeks,
and today, it ended in death.

1270
01:07:41,229 --> 01:07:44,094
And on the TV, sure enough,
they called his name.

1271
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:45,820
20-year old Denver Smith...

1272
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,994
Denver Smith and
Leonard Brown...

1273
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:51,895
Smith-Jones: He was never a part
of the movement at all.

1274
01:07:54,518 --> 01:07:57,763
If I hadn't been involved,

1275
01:07:57,797 --> 01:08:00,179
my brother never would have
been there.

1276
01:08:01,974 --> 01:08:04,010
The accident would
not have happened at all

1277
01:08:04,045 --> 01:08:05,805
if they had not taken it
upon themselves

1278
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,739
to occupy
the President's office.

1279
01:08:08,774 --> 01:08:11,328
That was the triggering
mechanism.

1280
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:15,298
Had they just gone about

1281
01:08:15,332 --> 01:08:17,472
peacefully demonstrating
and agitating

1282
01:08:17,507 --> 01:08:20,958
and doing what they wanted to do
and had a right to do,

1283
01:08:20,993 --> 01:08:22,995
it never would have happened.

1284
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:29,726
It came as a surprise to me

1285
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,866
after we found out later
that afternoon

1286
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,041
that Dr. Netterville
was not on campus

1287
01:08:35,076 --> 01:08:37,423
during the whole period of time
we were there,

1288
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:39,667
at the administration building,
with the students,

1289
01:08:39,701 --> 01:08:42,394
that he was not
on campus at all.

1290
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:50,574
I relived that moment

1291
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:52,680
because I was one of the leaders

1292
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:54,992
who led the students
to Netterville's office,

1293
01:08:55,027 --> 01:08:57,167
who believed
that he would go down

1294
01:08:57,202 --> 01:08:59,756
and get these students
out of jail,

1295
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:03,173
and they trusted me.

1296
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:05,071
Though I didn't pull
the trigger,

1297
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:09,075
as a leader,
I may have been responsible.

1298
01:09:13,252 --> 01:09:17,429
They were exercising
their constitutional rights,

1299
01:09:17,463 --> 01:09:20,225
and they get killed for it.

1300
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:22,917
They die for it.

1301
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:29,372
Nobody sent their child
to school to die.

1302
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:38,864
It just shouldn't have happened.

1303
01:09:42,695 --> 01:09:44,559
It shouldn't have happened.

1304
01:09:57,641 --> 01:10:03,095
♪ Lift every voice and sing

1305
01:10:03,129 --> 01:10:08,963

1312

My daughter's going to Spellman!
Yayyyy!

1313
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:10,093
We're excited to keep
the bloodline going,

1314
01:11:10,127 --> 01:11:12,509
'cause our family bleeds
orange and green.

1315
01:11:22,761 --> 01:11:24,694
And this one's for you. Thank you.

1316
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:29,112
The room is really small.

1317
01:11:29,146 --> 01:11:31,632
Don't know how all your stuff
is going to get in here.

1318
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:35,912
At my high school,
I was the token black girl.

1319
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:38,155
That was something
very hard for me.

1320
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,986
You're either the ratchet
black, ghetto person,

1321
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,298
or you're the exception.

1322
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:46,129
You're the high-achieving,
excellent...

1323
01:11:46,163 --> 01:11:48,580
That's what you are,
and I'm tired of those boxes.

1324
01:11:48,614 --> 01:11:50,720
I don't want to be one thing
or the other.

1325
01:11:50,754 --> 01:11:52,342
I want to be me.

1326
01:11:52,377 --> 01:11:55,587
I want to have the opportunity
to discover myself.

1327
01:11:58,486 --> 01:12:01,386
I do believe that going
to an HBCU was going to be

1328
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,249
a safe space,

1329
01:12:03,284 --> 01:12:06,977
somewhere where I can be free
to be completely myself.

1330
01:12:07,012 --> 01:12:08,531
I can be black.

1331
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:10,498
I can have curly hair.

1332
01:12:10,533 --> 01:12:12,362
I can be smart.

1333
01:12:12,397 --> 01:12:14,537
I can be whatever I want to be.

1334
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:22,614
When I walk on campus,
the excitement is unreal.

1335
01:12:22,648 --> 01:12:25,755
I love the stroll teams
that go around,

1336
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:28,896
chanting for their dorms.

1337
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,623
I love the step teams
that they have,

1338
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:36,559
And they all look like you.

1339
01:12:36,593 --> 01:12:38,077
They all look like you.

1340
01:12:38,112 --> 01:12:39,941
It's so good.

1341
01:12:39,976 --> 01:12:44,739
And this moment marks
the beginning

1342
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:46,638
of your journey.

1343
01:12:46,672 --> 01:12:49,951
This is the moment
where you part company

1344
01:12:49,986 --> 01:12:53,369
with your parents, your friends,
your loved ones.

1345
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:55,267
You say goodbye.

1346
01:12:55,301 --> 01:12:57,338
There's something very different

1347
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,202
about coming
into an environment

1348
01:12:59,236 --> 01:13:02,136
where you know that
everyone around you has

1349
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:04,414
the same chance
of being successful as you are

1350
01:13:04,449 --> 01:13:08,487
without negative implications
associated with race.

1351
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:13,319
What the black college
experience provides them

1352
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:15,114
is a place to be, finally,

1353
01:13:15,149 --> 01:13:16,978
at some point,
in the majority.

1354
01:13:17,013 --> 01:13:20,741
They look around and see people
who share common experiences.

1355
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:25,297
That is such a unique
and empowering experience.

1356
01:13:25,331 --> 01:13:26,574
My graduating class,

1357
01:13:26,609 --> 01:13:31,027
There weren't many
black students.

1358
01:13:31,061 --> 01:13:32,442
When I told my classmates

1359
01:13:32,477 --> 01:13:34,444
that I was going
to attend an HBCU,

1360
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,379
none of them even knew
what an HBCU was.

1361
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,382
Everyone was like, "Why?
Why do you want to go to FAMU?

1362
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,109
Why don't you want to go to,
like, USF or, like,

1363
01:13:44,143 --> 01:13:46,491
somewhere else?"

1364
01:13:46,525 --> 01:13:49,804
I never even had, like,
a black teacher, ever,

1365
01:13:49,839 --> 01:13:52,842
from K through 12.

1366
01:13:52,876 --> 01:13:55,361
I remember, like, always talking
to my mom about it.

1367
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:57,018
"When am I going to have
a black teacher?"

1368
01:13:57,053 --> 01:13:58,848
Like, "I want a black teacher."

1369
01:13:58,882 --> 01:14:01,506
On page 274,
we talked about hurdles

1370
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,197
that you have
to get through.

1371
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:05,475
I wanted to learn
from someone who looks like me

1372
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:07,995
because I thought, maybe,
the learning experience

1373
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:09,790
would be a little
bit different.

1374
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:15,968
My freshman year was when I had

1375
01:14:16,003 --> 01:14:18,246
the African American
history class,

1376
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:22,078
and that changed the world
for me.

1377
01:14:22,112 --> 01:14:25,806
Just knowing what my ancestors
went through

1378
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,602
to learn how to read,

1379
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:30,258
to get an education,

1380
01:14:30,293 --> 01:14:32,571
to be given the right
to sit in a classroom

1381
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:34,228
that have good books,

1382
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:37,300
and they worked so hard
for that.

1383
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:40,406
It makes me want to be better,

1384
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:42,132
and every day,
I just try to be great

1385
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:43,686
just because of that.

1386
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,205
It is our duty
to fight for our freedom.

1387
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,138
It is our duty to
fight for our freedom.

1388
01:14:48,173 --> 01:14:51,728
I just wanted to be
more involved

1389
01:14:51,763 --> 01:14:55,387
in the movement
that was happening now.

1390
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:57,527
We must love
and protect each other.

1391
01:14:57,562 --> 01:14:59,115
We must love and
protect each other.

1392
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:02,083
We have nothing to lose
but our chains.

1393
01:15:03,844 --> 01:15:07,744
Movements are easily birthed
on HBCs campuses.

1394
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:12,335
We're all going through
the same experience.

1395
01:15:12,369 --> 01:15:14,371
I just feel like I found myself

1396
01:15:14,406 --> 01:15:17,271
through being a student at FAMU.

1397
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:21,551
I hope that the future of HBCUs
is a positive one

1398
01:15:21,586 --> 01:15:24,312
and one that will bring
a lot of experiences

1399
01:15:24,347 --> 01:15:25,797
to more people,

1400
01:15:25,831 --> 01:15:29,697
but I'm fearful that
it's not going to be that way.

1401
01:15:45,299 --> 01:15:47,163
Come on, Brown fans.

1402
01:15:47,197 --> 01:15:49,855
Sing it one more time
for Morris Brown.

1403
01:16:05,112 --> 01:16:07,183
The future for black colleges

1404
01:16:07,217 --> 01:16:09,944
is actually contested
at this point.

1405
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:16,710
Many of them have not
been successful,

1406
01:16:16,744 --> 01:16:21,335
particularly over
the last 20 years.

1407
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,095
This is a shell.

1408
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,235
It's a shell
of a wonderful campus

1409
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,583
that used to be 34 acres.

1410
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:31,794
Fountain Hall, at one time,

1411
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:36,350
housed the offices of
Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois.

1412
01:16:38,663 --> 01:16:44,565
In 2003, Morris Brown College
lost its accreditation.

1413
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,947
It had 2,500 students
at that time,

1414
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:48,258
to what you see now,

1415
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:50,813
where we have
less than 50 students.

1416
01:16:52,711 --> 01:16:55,369
Wilson: Today, there are
over 100 black colleges.

1417
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,440
Some are flourishing.

1418
01:16:57,474 --> 01:17:01,375
Some, like Morris Brown College,
established in 1881,

1419
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:03,101
have all but closed.

1420
01:17:08,244 --> 01:17:11,972
Brown v. Topeka opened
the white colleges,

1421
01:17:12,006 --> 01:17:13,767
opened the field of choice

1422
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:18,944
for black students
and black faculty,

1423
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:21,464
often with a consequence that

1424
01:17:21,498 --> 01:17:23,535
black colleges lost enrollment,

1425
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:27,539
and they lost some of
their most talented faculty.

1426
01:17:27,573 --> 01:17:30,369
There's a lot more competition.

1427
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:33,441
What I think
successful colleges will do

1428
01:17:33,476 --> 01:17:37,031
will say, "If you come here,
you will find something

1429
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:39,965
you won't find any place else."

1430
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,727
So that's the kind of uniqueness
that you want to be able

1431
01:17:42,761 --> 01:17:45,557
to communicate
to your community.

1432
01:17:55,256 --> 01:17:56,706
I wanted to go home

1433
01:17:56,741 --> 01:17:59,329
because I felt like it
was too much to be here.

1434
01:17:59,364 --> 01:18:01,331
It's too hard.

1435
01:18:01,366 --> 01:18:03,817
And Dad gives me
this really long talk.

1436
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:05,646
He said, "Calvin,
we want you to go to FAMU

1437
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,823
because that is where you're
going to get the best experience

1438
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:12,584
as a musician
and as a black man.

1439
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:15,967
One, two, ready, and!

1440
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:18,141
The university has pushed me
very, very hard

1441
01:18:18,176 --> 01:18:23,595
to become a self-standing,
strong, centered individual.

1442
01:18:23,629 --> 01:18:26,632
I've grown as a musician
and as a leader.

1443
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,916
Three things I really want
from the university

1444
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,850
are support and
education and love,

1445
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:39,645
and since I've been here,
I've gotten just that.

1446
01:18:41,302 --> 01:18:42,718
Whoo!

1447
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:45,030
I know I'm really gonna
miss this environment

1448
01:18:45,065 --> 01:18:48,309
because I know I couldn't
get it anywhere else.

1449
01:18:48,344 --> 01:18:49,759
This is my last home game.

1450
01:18:49,794 --> 01:18:53,521
It's my last year at FAM,
getting ready to graduate,

1451
01:18:53,556 --> 01:18:56,248
and the world is about
to get that much bigger.

1452
01:18:58,043 --> 01:19:01,219
Young people are
the engine of change.

1453
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:05,464
They are the engine
of possibility.

1454
01:19:05,499 --> 01:19:08,157
They have a vision and a faith

1455
01:19:08,191 --> 01:19:11,643
in their own potential.

1456
01:19:11,677 --> 01:19:13,749
That spirit of being
at an HBCU is

1457
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:16,061
very unique,
very different.

1458
01:19:16,096 --> 01:19:17,580
It's like you have a match,

1459
01:19:17,614 --> 01:19:19,064
and you want to start a fire,

1460
01:19:19,099 --> 01:19:21,032
but you have no fuel whatsoever.

1461
01:19:21,066 --> 01:19:23,379
All you have is that one match.

1462
01:19:23,413 --> 01:19:26,900
This HBCU experience has
shown me and taught me

1463
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:30,144
that anything is possible as
long as you have that one spark.
