1
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,900
Turn A Gundam I

2
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,240
EARTH LIGHT

3
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,740
- One little, two little, three little Moonrace...
- Mary had a little lamb...

4
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,900
Approach speed, angle nominal.

5
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,910
All units, confirm reentry systems.

6
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,280
FLAT One, green.

7
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,620
FLAT Two is green.

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,820
FLAT Three is green.

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,020
FLAT Four is green.

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,220
FLAT Five is green.

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,690
FLAT Six is green.

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,360
- Ten little Moonrace girls...
- Mary had a little lamb...

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,190
- Close face guards.
- ...little lamb, little lamb...

14
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,150
Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow.

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,300
Mary had a little lamb,
little lamb, little lamb...

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,610
Ready!

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,500
Launch!

18
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,060
Careful, Loran, that's hot!

19
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,860
But it's neat!

20
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,300
Take care, Fran!
You, too, Loran!

21
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,360
Take care, Keith! Loran!

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,680
The coyote is running!

23
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,520
Take care, little boy!

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,400
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb...

25
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,260
Sis! That boy is drowning!

26
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,070
Queen Dianna?

27
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,550
Oh, dear...

28
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,350
You wanted this, right?

29
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,470
Please give that back!

30
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,850
Nothing doing!

31
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,780
Miss!

32
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,410
This is what he...

33
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,080
She looks just like
Queen Dianna...

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,220
Here is your goldfish.

35
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,900
Under the gaze of the White Doll!

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
To the Mountain Cycle!

37
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,840
To the Mountain Cycle!

38
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,340
- Let's go!
- Isn't that your sister?

39
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,970
Men will be men...

40
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,950
I will now select my partner
before the statue of the White Doll!

41
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,790
Loran! Finish what you're doing!

42
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,290
Yes, sir!

43
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,000
Boss Heim wants to see you!

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,220
He does?

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,700
Given your knack for machines,
you'll be our family's driver starting today.

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,000
You can handle that, right?

47
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,750
The color of your hair.

48
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,810
Excuse me?

49
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,290
It's the same as a boy I saw being
attacked by a coyote two years ago.

50
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,130
Spin up the motor!

51
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,700
Keith?

52
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,860
Loran?

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,030
It's only violin today?

54
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,230
Yes, isn't it dreadful?
Composition has also been canceled.

55
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,400
Take care!

56
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,150
I'm sorry to cut your lesson short.

57
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,310
That's all right.

58
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,720
- I'm off to the reference room,
- I missed you!

59
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,980
- so feel free to take your time here.
- Same here!

60
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,680
A meeting of hometown friends, huh?

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,790
What happened to it?

62
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,420
Don't talk about that!

63
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,190
Sorry, I'm just curious.

64
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,860
What are those three looking at?

65
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,200
We're counting on you.

66
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,930
I'll go check on it tonight.

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,140
Cahallan!

68
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,390
Everybody, the Earth
is a really great place!

69
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,290
Universe! Universe!

70
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,230
Everybody! The Earth
is a great place!

71
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,960
Come back soon!

72
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,530
Okay, take the picture!

73
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,370
I can't! I'm still swapping out
the film plate!

74
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,350
Turn off the radio! How are we
supposed to concentrate?!

75
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,010
Bostonia Castle? This is
Hills Socis Observatory.

76
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,620
Understood.
Continue your observations.

77
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,490
Colonel.

78
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,320
Yes?

79
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,920
The parade will have to be moved up.
Our uninvited guests are coming at last.

80
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,860
And... stop!

81
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,870
Sochie! Congrats on your solo flight!

82
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,500
Spare me the flattery.

83
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,370
You haven't logged many hours,
but you passed!

84
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,140
He's the amazing one.

85
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,750
Loran's grasp of machines is special.

86
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,550
He only started lessons
because I suggested it.

87
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,510
You're special, too. A Heim girl,
trying to become a Militia pilot?

88
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,590
Only because I have a friend
whose father makes airplanes.

89
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,320
My sister can handle
the family stuff.

90
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,090
That's asking a lot.

91
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,730
The Militia parade is the day
before the summer solstice?

92
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,860
That's what they decided.

93
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,100
But the Coming of Age
Ceremony starts that day!

94
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,200
That's why I won't be able
to see your ceremony.

95
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,040
I have to take these planes
to the parade.

96
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,740
Yeah, your father's planes
were put into service.

97
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,250
Got it! Okay, it's in!

98
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,220
This is all because Galia looks
like they're going to attack!

99
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,020
It's the Militia! All these
will be in the Nocis parade!

100
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,790
Listening gear and searchlights...

101
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,900
Loran!

102
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,860
Keep to the right!
Keep right!

103
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,700
This is pretty impressive...

104
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,380
Isn't this a little big for you
to use as an apartment, Sis?

105
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,410
This doubles as
the company dormitory.

106
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,780
I'm jealous, you get to go to
a party at Bostonia Castle.

107
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,290
You'll be invited
the year after next.

108
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,190
Sir?

109
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,300
We have to leave Nocis by 3PM.

110
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,390
You know where the garden party is, right?

111
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,900
Yes, sir.

112
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,450
His Excellency Lineford, Lord of Inglessa!

113
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,750
Present arms!

114
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,590
Isn't this grand?

115
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,030
Do you really think that Galia will attack us?

116
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,730
We created this mechanized military
to ensure that they don't.

117
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,370
Are you serious about enlisting in the Militia?

118
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,700
It's just like skipping university
and joining the workforce, right?

119
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,500
Don't be rude.

120
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,240
Good luck, soldier!

121
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm gonna be a soldier when I grow up!

122
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,580
Here comes the Militia Air Corps!

123
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,620
Why do Earthers always have their
eyes on the skies and never look down?

124
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,920
I guess because they don't know any better.

125
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,960
Hey, once the Return begins,
what are your plans?

126
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,490
I'll put good bread in everybody's bellies.

127
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll work hard to become a reporter
at the paper here.

128
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,600
And you?

129
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,670
I'll be a real citizen of Vicinity
after today's ceremony.

130
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,760
Miashei's in one of those!

131
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,820
Goodness, you summer up in Canadan?

132
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,280
I do hope that you will
consider it, Excellency.

133
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,720
Don't worry, I'll consider your proposal.

134
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,420
Excuse me.

135
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,720
It's true, I swear!

136
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,920
Laura.

137
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,720
Laura!

138
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,130
Are you looking for Mr. Heim?

139
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,960
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,230
Find Diran Heim!

141
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,940
Right away!

142
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,340
Would you be interested in working
at Bostonia Castle after your ceremony?

143
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,340
Well, Nocis is too big a city for me.

144
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,370
In that case, I'd like you
to assist Sid in his work.

145
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,750
Nowadays, even a prospector
needs engineers for his work.

146
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,480
Oh, work for Mr. Sid?

147
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,750
You know him, right?

148
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,290
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,650
If you're discussing employment,
perhaps you could also mention me?

150
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,320
Oh, dear.

151
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,830
We are in a time
when real-world experience...

152
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,690
...counts for more than studying
outdated subjects in a classroom.

153
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,500
True enough.

154
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,700
Young Lord, my younger daughter and
I will take our leave now.

155
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,110
Preserving local festivals is important.
Laura, think about that job with Sid.

156
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,210
I will.

157
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,110
Excuse us.

158
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,250
Master Guin, why do you always
call Loran Laura?

159
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,690
I'm not sure. Laura just seems
to suit him better.

160
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,620
Are you gonna work as that
prospector Sid's assistant, Laura?

161
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,100
My name isn't Laura.
It's Loran.

162
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,630
With Master Guin, it's always
Laura, Laura, Laura...

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,060
Lift!

164
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,870
Now, to the Mountain Cycle!

165
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,870
It's a shame the Missus isn't here to see this.

166
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,930
Hello.

167
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,830
Good evening.

168
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,920
You mentioned that you were
interested in the new age?

169
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,130
I'm also quite fond of dancing.

170
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,070
Allow me to show you a
product of the new age. Later.

171
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,970
A chosen pair of representatives
will anoint each other...

172
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,630
...with the sacred stigmata
before the White Doll!

173
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,840
Who among you will join me?

174
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,550
Sheesh, Tom!

175
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm over here!

176
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,680
That's embarrassing!

177
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,410
You can do it!

178
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,650
Don't lose out to Jack!

179
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,480
The Earth is great!

180
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,990
Everybody, come soon!

181
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,960
Loran Cehack!

182
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,800
This is a machine that can send
messages without wires?

183
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,630
That's right. The Moonrace sent it to us.

184
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,410
There is a people whose name means
the race that dwells on the Moon?

185
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,740
I've beefed up the Militia because
a group calling themselves that...

186
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,870
...want to settle in Ameria.

187
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,640
Do they intend to come here
in large numbers?

188
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
What's this noise?

189
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,620
What in the world?

190
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,780
What's that?

191
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,200
Let's go! We have to fly patrol!

192
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,500
This is a night flight!

193
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,860
I have plenty of experience
with Hip Heavies!

194
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,570
They're holding rituals like this
in an era when planes fly through the skies.

195
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,080
It takes more than reason
to make the world go round.

196
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,670
The mountain's deserted now,

197
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,880
so this is a perfect time
for survey work.

198
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,480
Ready, Loran?

199
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,420
We apply the stigmata, right?

200
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,180
Right.

201
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,190
Hurry up!

202
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,690
Right!

203
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,600
Stigmata, huh?

204
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,830
The container I gave you.

205
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,900
I know!

206
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,660
Hey!

207
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,670
Come on, Loran! How could you bring
a toy to my coming of age ceremony!

208
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,700
It's my last night, so I thought...

209
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,070
T-These are...

210
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,940
W-What are these?!

211
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,510
Leeches! We use those to brand
our backs with the sacred marks!

212
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,550
- Leeches?!
- They're coming out...

213
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,240
- I didn't know!
- That's how it's always been!

214
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,480
If I don't do this,
I won't be an adult?

215
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,520
That's cold!

216
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,130
Just do it! You're already two
years behind schedule!

217
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,760
They're wriggling!

218
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,620
Again?

219
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,440
What was that?

220
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,410
There's a glow coming from Nocis.

221
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,080
- That's the color of a fire!
- Hey, Loran!

222
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,640
Can you tell where it's coming from?!

223
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,380
It's definitely coming from Nocis!

224
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,120
What the heck is that?!

225
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,480
It's running!

226
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,320
But it looks like a machine to me!
The Bull Ones are attacking it!

227
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,080
What?

228
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,950
An earthquake?

229
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,780
Loran!

230
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,650
Sochie and Loran are...!

231
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,000
This is a...

232
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,500
What is it? What happened?

233
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,970
I don't know!

234
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,740
I can't believe it,
the White Doll is wrecked...

235
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,000
What's that?!

236
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,270
Whatever it is, it's glowing.

237
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,010
It's weirdly pretty.

238
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,850
It looks like it's turned on.

239
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,730
It moved!

240
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,530
Miss!

241
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,180
What?

242
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,520
It's safer in here.
Please, come down!

243
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,020
I wonder what made it turn on?

244
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,060
How should I know?!

245
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,500
It's the same as
a FLAT's VR Head?

246
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,570
The control panel's pretty
different, though.

247
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,180
Ow...

248
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,140
Miss!

249
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:52,810
It moved!

250
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,780
That's impossible!

251
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,890
The part that looks like
its arm is moving!

252
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,100
Something like this was inside...

253
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,730
the White Doll?

254
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,210
What's a mobile suit doing here?

255
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,110
Get down!

256
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,080
It fired!

257
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,150
What happened?
Loran, are you...

258
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,150
Loran?

259
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,630
What's the matter?

260
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,290
A machine ought to have
some kind of manual.

261
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,430
Oh, you're right. A manual.

262
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,300
Loran! You've got stigmata
on your back!

263
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,170
The sacred marks?

264
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,640
Yes! They're right there,
plain as day!

265
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,100
Fire!

266
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,020
If the searchlight would hit it...

267
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,990
Move it!

268
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,630
This is no time for photographs!

269
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,990
- Leave the children!
- This way!

270
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,330
- There's another airship!
- You can't all fit on board!

271
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,560
Can you make it up here?

272
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,730
I'm climbing up!

273
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,810
Me first!

274
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,830
My boss's daughter's on board!

275
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,970
Crap! Is the Dianna Counter invading?!

276
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,750
Keith!

277
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,020
Boss! Can you make it?!

278
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,450
Stop, Keith!

279
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,980
Sorry, Keith!

280
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,600
Somebody fired a beam towards Nocis!

281
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,280
What was that light?

282
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,840
It's the same as that last one!

283
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,270
It's the same as
that earlier shaft of light!

284
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,680
The Young Lord must be informed!

285
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47,890
The Duchess has fainted...

286
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,750
Of all the...

287
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,160
Where are you going?!

288
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,220
I must go to Master Guin's side.

289
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,060
- What should I do?
- What's that?

290
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,860
Those pillars are moving!

291
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,260
The barrage balloons are loose!

292
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,500
Mother!

293
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,360
Mother! Mother!
Wake up!

294
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,740
Mother!

295
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,840
Right, the general rule is to fall back!

296
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,820
Send our troops to the south.
We don't know what comes next.

297
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,060
- As the commander, I mustn't leave the castle.
- Don't fire from here!

298
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,890
- Have Col. Michael contact communications HQ!
- If there are fires, put them out!

299
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,230
- Don't get mad at me, we don't know, either!
- Sorry. You're a big help.

300
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,690
Not at all.

301
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,900
Did you anticipate this horrible situation?

302
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,670
This goes far beyond human understanding.

303
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,790
But if they're the people that we've
been in talks with for these two years...

304
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes?

305
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,100
Then they'll listen to reason.
Dianna Soriel will, anyway.

306
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,470
Dianna Soriel?

307
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,180
Loran, you've got the hang of it!

308
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,810
Old Man, someone's in there!

309
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,540
Who's operating it?

310
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,010
You did it, Loran!

311
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,310
I'd hardly call this piloting it.

312
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,790
Hey!

313
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,890
Is this one of the machines written
about in the secret Dark History?

314
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,830
What's the Dark History?

315
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,520
Loran! Make it move this instant!

316
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,330
Make it move?

317
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,670
Don't be careless and let the enemy see it!

318
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,630
See? You can do it!

319
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,370
Miss, please don't
sit on my legs.

320
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,210
Why not?

321
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,700
You'll make me press the...

322
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,350
Watch it!
Control it properly!

323
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,370
Balancers! Get control!

324
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,050
The ground collapsed under its feet.

325
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,490
There are mine tunnels all around here.

326
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,750
There was a cave-in?

327
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,450
So we might find more of
these mechanical dolls.

328
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,660
In that case, excavate the area around
the White Doll. You can use the Militia.

329
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,100
All right. I'm not sure if this Loran boy was
controlling it, but I'll have him help.

330
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,870
I will. It's a Dark History relic, after all.

331
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,340
Oh, about the mechanical doll
that came to life. It's a little odd.

332
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,310
It isn't operational?

333
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,720
No, it's not that.
The crazy thing has a mustache.

334
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,320
It's a mechanical doll
with a mustache?

335
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,550
The White Doll has a mustache?

336
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,900
Touchdown point is clear!
All hands, prepare for landing!

337
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,830
- That beam didn't belong to the Dianna Counter fleet.
- All stations, check in!

338
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,210
This blip to the upper left
of the firing point...

339
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,280
Isn't that the landing point of
the FLAT we sent two years ago?

340
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:25,970
Yes, sir.

341
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,480
Isn't it possible that it's fallen
into the hands of their Militia?

342
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,240
The beam is different.

343
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,910
Queen Dianna says to act peacefully,
but the Earth is a big place.

344
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,390
Why am I carrying you?

345
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,230
You're our driver, so it's your
job to give me a lift home, right?

346
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,860
I suppose it is.

347
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,310
Miss!

348
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,280
Sam, the Little Miss has returned!

349
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,610
Miss...

350
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,080
Sam! Jessica!

351
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,380
No!

352
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,220
Boss Heim...

353
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,920
Can't this do something?
I don't even know what era it's from.

354
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,430
I need to access the basic system...
Can't it even do voice input?

355
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,400
Father!

356
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,330
This is all your fault!
You wasted all that time!

357
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,340
Why didn't you save him in the mechanical
doll that came out of the White Doll?!

358
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,240
Father!

359
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,840
Miss!

360
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,720
Let go!

361
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,650
Where are you going?

362
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,210
To Nocis! I have to tell Mother
and my sister what happened, right?

363
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,490
You can't! Nocis is under attack, too.

364
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,250
You saw the fires from
the White Doll, remember?

365
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,490
What should we do?
What should we do, Loran?

366
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,700
- I'm going!
- You can't!

367
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,500
No!

368
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,830
Calm down!

369
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,880
Was... was this your doing, Queen Dianna?

370
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,140
I'm amazed you managed to
fire off that second shot.

371
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,810
The cover is so caked with nanoskin
buildup that it should have been stuck.

372
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,010
Is it wrecked?

373
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,470
- Ensign Poe! Lt. Cmdr. Phil wants to see you!
- The entire dome will need repairs.

374
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,040
Understood.

375
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,090
Am I looking at ten years in prison, sir?

376
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,150
The use of mega particle
cannons was banned,

377
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,320
and you fled back to base in spite
of spotting an enemy mobile suit.

378
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,090
You're looking at 15 years.
Or even 17.

379
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,390
Yes, sir.

380
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,410
But we're too shorthanded for that,
so you're going to redeem yourself.

381
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,440
Help out on our operation to
capture the mustached mobile suit.

382
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,750
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

383
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:16,770
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

384
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,720
Given the time of year, we need
to bury him now, Little Miss.

385
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,150
I know you aren't feeling well,

386
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,120
but there are papers
that need to be signed.

387
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,360
Little Miss...

388
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,790
Keith, you idiot...
What are you doing here?

389
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,040
This way, Miss.

390
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,570
Sprinkle some dirt
on your father first.

391
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,450
Go ahead and cry.
Cry until you've got it all out.

392
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,950
Come on, hurry.

393
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,850
I can't believe this is two or
three thousand years old.

394
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,830
Do you think it was made by
Moonrace living on Earth?

395
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,790
Oh, hey, I saw two beams
fired last night. Was that you?

396
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,100
I only fired once.

397
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,170
I don't even know how
to read this thing yet.

398
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,500
I guess not.

399
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,410
Let's sell the FLAT to the Militia.

400
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,900
Sell the FLAT?

401
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,240
I think we could get a lot for it.

402
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,150
What are you saying?
That's Dianna Counter property!

403
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,580
Maybe, but the Earth and Moon
just started a stupid war.

404
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,220
There won't be a...

405
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,690
How do you know that?!

406
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,660
The fighting won't stop here.

407
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,960
Scarecrow spotted!
It's in the corn fields!

408
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,730
Ready!

409
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,960
Fire!

410
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,940
Ensign Poe! I don't want to
get hit by a lucky shot!

411
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,170
Please take out those guns!

412
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,470
If we have to defend ourselves,
they leave us no choice!

413
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,520
It sounds like the shelling's
getting close again, Jessica!

414
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,160
Miss Sochie, get out of bed!
We might be in danger here!

415
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,960
Have you loaded up the auto?

416
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,190
Just an emergency kit.

417
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,500
- Protect the fields!
- Outsiders go home!

418
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,130
Mechanical dolls go home!

419
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,800
How barbaric... They're savages!

420
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,330
Our orders are to not fire on people!

421
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,200
We're being shot up!

422
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,440
Don't let them reach town!

423
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,190
These Militia maniacs...

424
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,020
Two WaDs have been destroyed?
And now their biplanes are here?!

425
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,000
They're running!

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
They got away?

427
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,860
The little guys are running, too!

428
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,630
Filthy Militia savages!

429
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,630
I thought that all hostilities had been banned.

430
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,640
The savages have a
cutting-edge mobile suit.

431
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,140
A mobile suit?

432
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,040
I only wanted to capture it, and
then everybody got involved!

433
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,820
Lt. Harry? Where are you?

434
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,350
Above Nocis.

435
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,920
The Soleil is coming down.
Set up a defensive perimeter.

436
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,350
I answer only to Lt. Cmdr. Phil.

437
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,050
I'll return after I've gathered
intel on that mobile suit.

438
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,330
Lt. Cmdr. Phil has...

439
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,890
Has what?!

440
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,930
He seems to have a soft spot for you, Ensign.

441
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,300
So what?!

442
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,070
A suit is closing in?
What is it?

443
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,650
I don't want to let it get too
close to the manor. Or the Mountain Cycle.

444
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,020
So this is an Earth breeze, huh?

445
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,230
I'm a Moonrace!

446
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,430
I'm Loran Cehack, sent to Earth
two years ago...

447
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,180
...for an environmental
adaptability test.

448
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,470
Wait there!

449
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,980
That was a woman... I wonder if
she's the person who fired twice.

450
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,710
Those people they say
are from the Moon...

451
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,050
...are after the mechanical doll
that came out of Mt. Ark!

452
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,180
The Militia's gathered together
and has been fighting them off.

453
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,260
But here you are, even though you
said you wanted to fight in airplanes!

454
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,270
Your late father wouldn't be
pleased if you didn't try to avenge him.

455
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,160
Avenge my father?

456
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,030
Isn't this why you learned to fly?

457
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,470
I can avenge him!

458
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,640
That's him!

459
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,770
Old Man Sid?
Did you find anything?

460
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,380
Another mechanical doll appeared?

461
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,510
Hang on.
You need manpower?

462
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,160
- Another cave-in!
- It's an earthquake!

463
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,490
- Again?!
- Old Man Sid?

464
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,720
Put together a rescue team!

465
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,490
Col. Michael also ordered us to hurry up!

466
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,990
We're going to go excavate
Dark History relics! Got it?!

467
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,290
Loran Cehack,

468
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,000
born in the Meizam district
on 11/2/2328 of the Correct Century.

469
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,980
Upon graduation from middle school,
participated in Earth drop in FLAT #2!

470
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,250
You have been extremely robust
in both mind and body...

471
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,440
...in the two-year medical study mission.

472
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,880
Y-Yes, sir!

473
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,680
Your biometrics transmitter
has already dissolved.

474
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,790
Yes, sir.

475
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,560
He had a goldfish with him?

476
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,390
Sir?

477
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,020
Oh, you must mean Mary.
I have permission for it.

478
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,860
A prized childhood possession?

479
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,060
Yes.

480
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,360
Perhaps you could repeat to us
what you told Ensign Poe?

481
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,700
In Vicinity, I never heard any
rumors regarding mobile suits.

482
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,610
However, they say that one
appeared after a WaDom...

483
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,840
...fired on the Mountain Cycle during
the Coming of Age Ceremony...

484
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,850
...on the night of
the summer solstice.

485
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,550
Are there no rumors to the effect
that the Militia has built mobile suits?

486
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,790
The Heim mines don't produce
mineral resources on that scale.

487
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,590
No speculation, please.

488
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,130
That may be the case at the Heim Mine.

489
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,790
I'm sorry.

490
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,960
Captain!

491
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,970
Stress and nerves must
have gotten to him.

492
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,540
Take deep breaths, Loran.

493
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,310
Lt. Harry. Keep questioning Loran
while we travel to the castle.

494
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,150
Old Man Sid, this doesn't look natural.

495
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,520
You're right. This metal isn't mine ore.

496
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,420
Joseph! What do you make of this?

497
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,730
Did they find something?

498
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,490
- I'm not sure. It's not a machine...
- Bring a light!

499
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,490
An electrical circuit, maybe?
Those look like electrical traces.

500
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,930
Does it go further in?

501
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,830
The air is fresh, so it's big.

502
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,370
Lt. Harry. If you've heard everything,
perhaps you should let the boy leave?

503
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,940
Yes, sir. I was about
to send him home.

504
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,480
Military men only think
in terms of war, I guess.

505
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,520
Don't forget to note the
name of the speaker.

506
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,320
Yes, I understand.
Loran?

507
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,280
There's something that I
need to tell you, Miss.

508
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,480
It's time for the stenographer
to enter the room.

509
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,860
Understood.

510
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,930
Miss Kihel.

511
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,490
They're shorthanded here, so I have
to fill in as stenographer.

512
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,730
Stay here. We'll talk
after the meeting.

513
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,000
Please let this boy stay here.
Look after him.

514
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,680
Who is he?

515
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,010
My family's driver.

516
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,050
Surely that wasn't her...

517
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,120
We didn't bring her.

518
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,690
It should be abundantly clear to you...

519
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,730
...that our level of science and
technology far surpasses yours.

520
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,530
And you must be aware of
the might of our mechanical doll.

521
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,900
Its pilot, Laura, is not a unique prodigy.

522
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,640
- Are you suggesting that we settle this in battle?
- A mustached mobile suit piloted by a Laura, huh?

523
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,770
Not at all. The father of the young
lady transcribing this meeting...

524
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,510
...was killed in the attack that you launched.

525
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,520
We will take no offensive action if
you yield this continent's Sunbelt to us.

526
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,850
You are concerned only
with your own interests.

527
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,450
We negotiated for two years.

528
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,320
We said that we wish to return to
what was our homeland 2,000 years ago...

529
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,200
A bolt?

530
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,800
If it's a fight you want,
pick up a gun!

531
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,060
Don't do this, Elder Iru!

532
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,100
My wife and nephew
were killed last night!

533
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,480
Draw a gun, old man!

534
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,380
Shut your mouths, you barbarians!

535
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,550
Another!

536
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,780
Another cavity opened up!

537
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,680
Elder Iru!

538
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,520
Young Lord... You cannot
be allowed to die...

539
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,960
Do not think that this
evens the scales!

540
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,070
There will be a temporary
cease-fire. But only temporary!

541
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,500
- I must ask you to leave!
- You don't belong in a place like this.

542
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,800
- Carry the Captain out of here!
- You don't belong in a place like this.

543
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,770
Let's go home.

544
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,640
That's a good idea. And I'm sure
that your mother will recover at home.

545
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,470
Yes.

546
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,380
About your mechanical doll, Laura.

547
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,810
Master it, no matter what.

548
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,140
Will there be a war?

549
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,980
I don't think we can
fight them for real.

550
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,880
Look!

551
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,030
Metal spheres?

552
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,830
Th-They're machines!

553
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,870
Were beautiful things like this
spoken of in the Dark History?

554
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,990
They look like they
were built yesterday!

555
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,330
These are relics of that time?

556
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,350
Military might makes it
easier to negotiate?

557
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,680
What's going on?

558
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,660
We're changing course.
A Militia squad is coming.

559
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,290
Where?

560
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,830
A squad?
Do you see them, Miss?

561
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,330
Sochie?!

562
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,530
You see Miss Sochie?

563
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,040
Isn't that her and Miashei?

564
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,470
It's a Hip Heavy, but I don't...

565
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,440
Attention, airship!
Lower your altitude!

566
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,510
It's my sister!
Is Loran with her?

567
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,650
Wasn't that Sochie at the controls?

568
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,150
It was! She joined the Militia!

569
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,180
Are we back home?

570
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,050
Fighting in an airplane like that
won't do any good!

571
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,120
Loran, be careful!

572
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:31,030
The reason Miss Sochie joined the
Militia is to avenge your father.

573
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,570
Then haven't you found any weapons
that the White Doll can use?

574
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,140
No, nothing but mechanical dolls
with round bodies.

575
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,570
They found more doll-types in
Lousana, so the Mustache's weapons...

576
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,190
...have to be somewhere.

577
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,520
It sounds like the Universal
Century really did exist in the ancient past.

578
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,650
That's probably why there are also
people living on the Moon.

579
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,220
It'll take more than size
to beat the Dianna Counter.

580
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,660
Are you sure there aren't
any gadgets inside it?

581
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,000
I've looked through this notebook,
but haven't found anything.

582
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,630
Dummy.

583
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,030
I am?

584
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,380
Where did you press it?

585
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,570
It's tricky.

586
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,240
Let me see.

587
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,210
Hello, Sam. Keep up
the good work.

588
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,010
Kihel?

589
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,990
This photo needs
its glass replaced.

590
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,990
Yes, Mother.

591
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,220
Your father makes such a fuss
if I don't stay on top of these things.

592
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,490
Yes, Mother.

593
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,990
I am not implying that
your side started all of...

594
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,630
...the skirmishes that we have
been seeing everywhere.

595
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,070
Anyone would be startled by the
sudden appearance of 40-meter tall machines.

596
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,170
If you had only believed us...

597
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,470
Words alone are worthless.

598
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,180
Excuse me.

599
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,150
Queen Dianna is coming down
for that very reason.

600
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,780
I said that I approved that.

601
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,480
Can't you forward that call
to this phone?

602
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,220
Personal calls go through
to this line. It's my fiancée.

603
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:17,430
Their supreme commander will be
coming down at Nocis' north airfield.

604
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:22,370
That's fine. It will be the perfect
chance to demonstrate our strength.

605
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,870
Those ball-shaped mechanical
dolls... Kapools, you said?

606
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,640
Yes. I had a memo to that effect.

607
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,720
Would you mind doing it
this way, Col. Michael?

608
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,910
Yes.

609
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,620
Are those the mechanical dolls
that you excavated?

610
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,920
They're called Kapools.

611
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,690
Our mechanical dolls are finally
being sent into action!

612
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,240
Hi, Sis!

613
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
Sochie! Come down this instant!

614
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,530
I can't!
I'm the one driving it!

615
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,810
A woman pilot? She's amazing!

616
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,140
She is...

617
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,610
Don't put oil in them!

618
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,240
The machine oil they mention in
the Dark History isn't like ours!

619
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,120
- Loran!
- Col. Michael, this is crazy!

620
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,420
Keep your voice down!

621
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,780
- The truck squad isn't enough!
- Thank you.

622
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,830
Then mobilize some motor buses, too!

623
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,560
They're going to have weaknesses,
no matter how advanced they are.

624
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,030
These orders come from
Guin Lineford himself.

625
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,830
From Master Guin?

626
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,060
Aren't they amazing, Sis?

627
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,460
Do you drive one of those,
too, Miashei?

628
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,270
You can't drive one of those
unless you're an airplane pilot.

629
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,710
I'm here to take you home.
Let's go, Sochie.

630
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,700
I can't! They say we'll
have a mission today!

631
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,040
Aren't you worried about Mother?

632
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,380
I can tell that she's okay
just by looking at you.

633
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,220
Sochie...

634
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,820
If we capture their
supreme commander,

635
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,050
no matter how powerful their
weapons are, they won't dare to use them.

636
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,930
On the other hand, if we kill her,
it spells our defeat.

637
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,730
If we wait until AFTER Lady Dianna
enters the city, this will...

638
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,000
What's with this lady stuff?

639
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,030
I'm sorry.

640
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,710
Your mechanical doll will act as
Master Guin's bodyguard, Laura.

641
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,140
Understood?

642
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,080
Yes, sir...

643
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,090
They're really something, aren't they?

644
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,060
Indeed, sir.

645
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,990
Laura will be here. I'm fed up
with being beaten one-sidedly.

646
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,030
He's something else.

647
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,570
It's come unarmed, has it?
How brazen.

648
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,440
She's here!

649
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,450
It's the Soleil! Queen Dianna
is leading the return here!

650
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,100
Queen Dianna's there
on the bridge...

651
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,220
Col. Michael is inside
Bostonia Castle?

652
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,410
Yes, sir.

653
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,780
He went to Bostonia Castle...

654
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,190
That will be all.

655
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,160
Yes, sir.

656
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,250
Behind the tower!
Something is moving!

657
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,930
Maybe at maximum magnification...

658
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,900
Queen Dianna!

659
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,540
It's really her!

660
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,700
She's riding in that!

661
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,900
I am Dianna Soriel.
Lord Guin Sard Lineford, I assume?

662
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,300
I-I am. And you are
Her Majesty Dianna Soriel?

663
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,010
I am pleased to meet you.

664
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,030
As am I.

665
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,670
All members of the advance team,
thank you for your hard work!

666
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,180
These are SUMO mobile suits,
Dianna's Royal Guard.

667
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,690
I see that you have a fine
mobile suit, as well.

668
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,520
We were surprised.

669
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,760
Laura's mobile suit is
still only a prototype.

670
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,890
Laura's mobile suit...

671
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,810
They must think they're disguised
as greengrocers, but that won't fool anyone.

672
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,550
What's that?

673
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,550
Here he comes! Go back to the Moon!

674
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,540
The citizens are rioting?
Did Guin put them up to it?

675
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,840
Drop dead!

676
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,580
Queen Dianna went down
the road to the left!

677
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,520
Hold your fire! Don't let her
out of your sight!

678
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,430
Capture that Dianna woman!

679
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,920
The Militia have blocked the road!

680
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,760
Have you ordered them to take
Her Majesty prisoner?!

681
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,890
This limousine is too conspicuous.
The castle is close enough to walk to.

682
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,840
You expect me to walk?

683
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,810
I refuse.

684
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,570
It sounds fascinating.

685
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,580
Majesty!

686
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,810
We traveled here
all the way from up there.

687
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,220
You've got nothing to complain about!

688
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,850
You're always like this!

689
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,050
Let me believe in you,
Dianna Soriel.

690
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,390
Very well.

691
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,330
There's still no reports that the
Moon queen's been captured?!

692
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,220
Open fire, I said!

693
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,310
Their mechanical dolls aren't
shooting! Okay, let's move!

694
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,770
All right, let's go.

695
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,410
We aren't budging.

696
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,030
Why not?

697
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,270
We brought you here in order to
hand over Bostonia Castle to you!

698
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,240
We will not...

699
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,640
Get down!

700
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,990
Let us do as
Guin Lineford suggests.

701
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,680
May I?

702
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,950
Here comes!

703
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,630
Lt. Harry! The Mustache is coming!

704
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,560
Where?!

705
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,890
Permission to open fire!

706
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,230
No!

707
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,370
The Royal Guard? Is that
the SUMO from the airfield?

708
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,140
Don't open fire. There's no telling
where Queen Dianna is in all this.

709
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,010
Lt. Harry!

710
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,060
Stop!

711
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,960
Stop this, Laura!

712
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,760
Lt. Harry! Queen Dianna
is over here!

713
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,030
Magistrate Miran?
She is there?

714
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,040
Laura! You mustn't fight inside Nocis!

715
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,810
Queen Dianna!

716
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,000
It's really Queen Dianna!

717
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,010
Harry Ord! Desist!

718
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,980
A fine mobile suit.

719
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,510
I can even tell that
its pilot is shaking.

720
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,210
I'm shaking?

721
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,260
Lt. Harry, see to my protection!

722
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,130
Laura, stand by outside Nocis!

723
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,970
I have no combat command authority.

724
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:39,270
Nevertheless, last night's incident
cannot be tolerated.

725
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,880
We handed over Bostonia Castle to
show that we wish to continue negotiations.

726
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,280
I would like you to hand
over the responsible parties.

727
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,090
I am dusty after all that commotion.

728
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:50,920
Of course.

729
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,080
Your rooms are this way.

730
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,420
Thank you.

731
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,860
This way, Majesty.
Please follow me.

732
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,320
They might have kicked the Militia
out of Nocis, but look at how close they are!

733
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,390
It was Queen Dianna's decision.

734
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:31,720
What are you talking about, Poe?
Our job is to compensate for her weaknesses.

735
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,460
The Militia is beefing up their forces.

736
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,030
That's what happens during
cease-fires. Take us out.

737
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:38,930
Yes, sir.

738
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,240
Lousanan troops are the toughest!

739
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,300
We'll never give them our women!

740
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,740
I can't believe they eat food
placed directly on the ground.

741
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,580
Basically, they're the same as dogs.

742
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,150
Patrol the Vicinity area.

743
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,890
Yes, sir.

744
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,550
What are those people doing,
gathered together like that?

745
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,290
It seems like wherever there's a
crowd in this area, there's a party.

746
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,990
Cheers!

747
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,440
- Eat up!
- We brought more food than bullets!

748
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,600
- Machines can't beat people!
- These aliens ain't so tough!

749
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,100
- What territory you're from don't matter!
- I'll love aliens and Moonrace alike!

750
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,800
- You Lousanans are okay by me!
- Love will save the Earth!

751
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,480
Let us throw a party.

752
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,720
A ball is just the thing to thaw
relations between the Moon and Earth.

753
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,990
Such timid diplomacy would be...

754
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,190
There mustn't be a war.

755
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:36,960
Indeed.

756
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,160
About the truth of the Dark History...

757
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,790
The Dark History relics, Majesty?

758
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,240
We must end their excavations.

759
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,000
Agreed.

760
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,340
I've been waiting.

761
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,400
I heard downstairs.
There will be a party?

762
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:01,990
The Royal Guards' Lt. Harry Ord says
he is eager to meet the White Doll's pilot.

763
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,310
But I can't dance!

764
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,150
I'm ordering you as a
member of the Militia.

765
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,290
I don't have anything to wear.

766
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,160
Kihel Heim will
assist you with that.

767
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,040
Master Guin wants to show that we
have a mechanical doll as good as theirs,

768
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,940
and that it is a woman who is driving it.

769
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,940
We want a cake like this.

770
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,570
It's two meters tall?

771
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,620
Here's the deposit.
The rest will be paid on delivery.

772
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,150
Thanks.

773
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,090
Bye, then.

774
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,610
Thanks for waiting.

775
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,320
Should we be accepting
orders from the enemy?

776
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,550
This money couldn't have come
at a better time. Thanks, Keith.

777
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,890
Don't mention it, Miss.

778
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,360
So, a cake over
two meters high, huh?

779
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,430
One, two... One, two...

780
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,700
I told you to keep your
back straight, didn't I?

781
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,640
Take a look.

782
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,950
Does it look strange?

783
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,380
It looks strange.

784
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,620
You think so?

785
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,840
You're kidding!

786
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,080
Corsets...

787
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,820
...make your waist slimmer,
and that's crucial to a woman!

788
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,550
That hurts!

789
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,760
Good! Like that!
Move with your partner!

790
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,300
- Good!
- I wouldn't call this a partner!

791
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,980
- What unusual clothing...
- Well, history is the product of war...

792
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,440
Thank you.

793
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,520
Both sides are simply eyeing each other.

794
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,310
We need an icebreaker, or this
will be an awkward evening.

795
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,490
Are they going to call it off?

796
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,790
I doubt it.

797
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,990
Then allow me.

798
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,160
Be relaxed.

799
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,180
I will.

800
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,830
He's coming over!

801
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,700
The dance floor is going to waste.

802
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,770
What gaudy clothing...

803
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,970
Given the situation, it would
be rude not to accept.

804
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,230
You're right. Go on.

805
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,240
I couldn't possibly! I don't...

806
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,040
Get in there and show off
the fruits of your lessons!

807
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:10,820
It's Laura Rolla!

808
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,150
This is turning into a battle of the sexes!

809
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,990
- Ah, Miss Laura.
- They're mechanical doll pilots?

810
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,750
Excuse me. Would you care
to dance, Lieutenant?

811
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,450
I'd be delighted, Laura.

812
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,030
Lead... Lead away, Lieutenant.

813
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,960
Right this way.

814
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,630
Let's go, too.

815
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,830
Carry out the mission!

816
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,130
May I have the honor of this dance?

817
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,140
It would be my pleasure.

818
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,780
The people from Donkey Bakery are here.

819
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:46,010
We'll add the finishing touches here.

820
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,620
The Militia brought in the Moonrace's cake?

821
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,650
Call it a show of friendly cooperation.

822
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,980
I don't believe you utterly
outclass us militarily.

823
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,220
You refer to the excavation of
relics of the ancient space age?

824
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,330
Lt. Harry.

825
00:49:59,330 --> 00:49:59,990
Yes?

826
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,260
I would like to introduce Laura
to Queen Dianna.

827
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,930
Yes, of course.

828
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,000
I will return her afterwards.

829
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,000
Laura Rolla is coming over?

830
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,300
There's no need to make chit-chat.

831
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,640
Oh, what's the harm? Hush!

832
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,240
May I introduce Laura Rolla,

833
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,910
ace pilot of the White Doll,
the pride of the Militia?

834
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,180
Thank you for the honor of an
audience with Your Majesty.

835
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,860
Queen Dianna...

836
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,480
Yes?

837
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:31,060
Why does the fighting continue in
spite of Your Majesty's arrival?

838
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,660
Young lady, this is neither
the time nor the place!

839
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,490
Laura! Don't be rude!

840
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,070
Queen Dianna, did you...

841
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,300
I believe a hand-kiss
is customary first, Laura Rolla.

842
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,340
Y-Yes, Majesty.

843
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,100
Our wish is the same.
We do not wish to fight.

844
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,010
Of course.

845
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:53,450
Lord Guin, we mustn't keep people
whom we both hold dear in a state of worry.

846
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,280
I agree.

847
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,920
It's a friendship cake!

848
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,990
That's a cake?
The star of the show is here!

849
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,490
Now that looks worth eating!

850
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,230
And now...

851
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,750
How magnificent!

852
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,800
Please step up to the cake.

853
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,840
Queen Dianna
and Master Guin, together!

854
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:24,180
As a sign of your friendship,
please place a rose in each other's lands.

855
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,810
Very well.

856
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,280
Prepare to...

857
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,740
Bastards!

858
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,520
Dianna!

859
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,920
If Dianna hadn't come here...

860
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,430
...there wouldn't be any fighting!

861
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,050
Why, you!
There's more outside?

862
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,860
That way!

863
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,970
Security!

864
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,130
Hold it!

865
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,930
After them!

866
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,740
What happened, Laura?

867
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,140
Assassins!

868
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,140
Miss Laura?

869
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,180
In a mobile suit?

870
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,250
Is that them?

871
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,180
Militia fiends!

872
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,190
A mechanical doll!

873
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,360
Why are you people doing this?!

874
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,690
One got away!

875
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,800
I can't control it
precisely enough!

876
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,210
Why didn't you hold them tight?
Did you let them escape?!

877
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,080
If I'd grabbed them too hard,
I would have crushed them!

878
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,240
Are you that clumsy a pilot?

879
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,250
What do you make of this, sir?

880
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,520
Make of what?

881
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,180
It's a portable oxygen respirator.

882
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,590
A respirator? Then they...

883
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,460
Assassins that were using respirators?
Then they must have been...

884
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,300
I want all hands helping
to unload that ship!

885
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,370
Remember to match the contents
against the checklist!

886
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,500
Three mobile suits?

887
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,910
I don't see them anywhere in the manifest!

888
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,700
That man, he's...

889
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,960
You know him, ma'am?

890
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,890
He's more dangerous than all
the explosives they just sent us.

891
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,000
Worse than explosives?

892
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,830
They sent a guy like him?!

893
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,780
He was pardoned and released from
the military cold sleep prison?

894
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,640
From the cold sleep prison?

895
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,540
New input?

896
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,120
Our Earth arrival report.

897
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,710
We're the Corin Nander Autonomous
Squad. It's a pleasure.

898
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,150
I'm Bruno. This is Jacop.

899
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,230
We're just as unhappy about this
walking catastrophe as you are.

900
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,560
The blue sky! Green, green!
Everything's so gaudy on Earth!

901
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,240
Where's Lt. Zenoa?

902
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,430
Out on an excavation survey.

903
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,240
Could you forward me their location?

904
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:11,110
Yeah, we're gonna unload this guy
and have them ship us back to the Moon.

905
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,390
- This doesn't make any sense!
- Miss?

906
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,960
I've set it to recognize your voice,
so you just have to say a topic heading.

907
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,960
I don't even know what the topics
are! That's why I can't use it!

908
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,660
That's why I've been
studying every day.

909
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:38,760
I can't instantly be able to work
a Moonrace-level machine!

910
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,000
Sorry...

911
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,150
A Moonrace-level machine...
Loran, are you...

912
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,240
What is it?

913
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,010
I'll study harder.

914
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,120
Please do, Miss.

915
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,120
Moonrace...

916
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,920
Higher-ups and common folk alike
are getting too excited here.

917
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,790
I regret that as a result,

918
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,530
our talks have stalled and our
soldiers are starting skirmishes.

919
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,970
I'd like you to use your advanced
communications gear...

920
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,100
...to inform all Moonrace
how you feel.

921
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,040
What sort of woman is she?
She humbly bowed in apology.

922
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,010
What is your purpose in stationing
an airship at the castle?

923
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,550
I'm having it survey the damage
from the fighting.

924
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,590
In order to provide relief
to the victims.

925
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,920
Ah, I see. Will it be
conducting further flights?

926
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,900
I'm glad you're here!
Hide the White Doll in the woods!

927
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,030
The mechanic squad is here?

928
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,200
That's right. You and Loran need
to go to Bostonia Castle!

929
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,870
But there are Moonrace there!

930
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,240
That's why!

931
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,480
Kapools, start digging out its feet
starting from the left side!

932
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,940
Move those on the right
to the left side, too!

933
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,480
Watch your feet!

934
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,350
Move as a group!

935
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,550
- Move the Kapool this way!
- The money we agreed on.

936
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,040
Oh. Thank you.

937
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,660
That's enough to buy a house.

938
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,360
Can you drive this thing?

939
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,060
No, I want to expand
our bakery with this.

940
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:12,270
Too bad. It's going to take a while
for our airplane pilots to figure it out.

941
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,640
Don't worry.

942
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:18,870
I bet this has some
kind of manual.

943
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,040
We will be on an airship, so it
ought to be something loose.

944
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,670
Oh, I see. How about this?

945
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,850
Might I trouble you to model
them for me, Miss Kihel?

946
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,580
Model them for you?

947
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,460
What do you think?

948
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,220
I like it!

949
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:40,520
Miss Kihel, would you mind letting
me see you in my own outfit?

950
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,790
You want me to wear
your outfit, Majesty?

951
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,270
It's all right, isn't it?
Please.

952
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,800
And the finishing touch...
Ah, I see.

953
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,270
Would you mind turning
around slowly?

954
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,350
So this is what
I look like from behind.

955
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:03,380
But surely you can see yourself
from behind in films or whatnot?

956
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,680
It's not the same as seeing
the real thing.

957
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,630
Sir Magistrate Miran!

958
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,590
No sir is needed.

959
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,600
I see.

960
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,600
Miran, we shall now embark
on our inspection flight.

961
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,500
Oh, well done!

962
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,400
Miss Kihel, you scamp!

963
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,770
Queen Dianna!

964
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,100
Queen Dianna must have been lonely...

965
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,530
Who is it?

966
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,670
Magistrate Miran. I am here to
escort you to the airship.

967
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:30,710
You may enter!

968
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:31,420
Yes, Majesty.

969
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,150
Proceed, Queen Dianna.

970
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,140
What if we're discovered?

971
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:38,280
Then we shall simply
apologize together.

972
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:41,290
Right this way,
Queen Dianna Soriel.

973
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,460
Magistrate Miran, please lead the way.

974
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,360
Are you sure we should go
all the way to Vicinity, sir?

975
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,500
There will be nothing but wrecked
gun batteries along that course, correct?

976
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,710
Lord Guin, visitors.

977
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:55,500
Who is it?

978
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,800
Loran Cehack and Sochie Heim, sir.

979
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,640
Show them in.

980
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,470
Yes, sir!

981
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,040
Is their move-in coming along?

982
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,910
Are we really giving the castle to Dianna?

983
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,880
If I don't, the local lords won't play along.

984
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,790
You came?

985
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,950
I have a report from Old Man Sid.

986
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,510
- Thank you.
- Also...

987
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:18,250
Also, send my sister home.
Our mother isn't doing well.

988
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,000
I'll send her home on the
airship that is about to leave.

989
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,600
The mustached machine
has a sword of light?

990
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:25,500
Yes.

991
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,330
It's more of a device that emits a stream of
superheated particles than light, though.

992
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,640
The airship is leaving soon.

993
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,540
And now you, Miss Kihel.

994
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,950
I shall go with you, then.

995
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,170
So, this is the gondola...

996
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:03,930
I've never boarded an airship
this way, either.

997
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,940
Please be careful. You must
speak in a haughtier manner.

998
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,570
Of course, I must sound
more pompous.

999
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,820
Please put your mind at ease.
Airships float in the air by their nature.

1000
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,960
I am aware.

1001
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,550
Queen Dianna, the aft section
is set up as an observation area.

1002
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,560
Ah, it is?

1003
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,820
Dianna? Sis?

1004
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,400
Loran? Sochie...

1005
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,700
Sochie Heim!

1006
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,930
We had not been informed that
you would be here, Majesty!

1007
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,980
Your sister told me
all about you.

1008
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,670
Please put yourself
at ease, Loran.

1009
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,070
Thank you!

1010
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,010
Sis, Mother has been crying,
saying that she's lonely.

1011
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,320
This airship is scheduled to make a
loop around Vicinity and then return.

1012
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,260
Why don't we get out there?

1013
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,160
Yes. I would like to
disembark there, as well.

1014
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,820
Is that acceptable?

1015
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:06,100
As you wish. Miss Kihel,
could you make us some tea?

1016
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,810
- Yes.
- Allow me!

1017
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,000
Let's see, where's the tea set?

1018
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,140
Dummy, isn't that my sister's job?

1019
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,390
How beautiful...

1020
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,900
Yes. It is particularly lovely today.

1021
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:46,470
Such a landscape mustn't be marred by war.

1022
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,770
There is also the food issue.

1023
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:52,850
Yes, neither side's forces must
harm this breadbasket region.

1024
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,040
Of course.

1025
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,120
Do the lords of the
Amerian continent agree?

1026
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,810
Let's convince them.

1027
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,680
I'd like to borrow
Miss Kihel, if I may.

1028
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,850
Feel free.

1029
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,230
Mobile suits!

1030
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,330
You don't have a change of clothes?

1031
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:11,360
I'm afraid not.

1032
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,260
And you, Miss Sochie?

1033
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,440
What kind of clothing?

1034
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:21,740
Queen Dianna's outfit is conspicuous.
It will draw the Militia's attention.

1035
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,210
Your room wasn't damaged
in the fire,

1036
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:28,050
so just lend her something.
Or don't you want to?

1037
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:32,590
It's not that. I just thought that perhaps
there was something aboard the airship.

1038
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,950
Talk about stupid.
Of course there aren't.

1039
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:39,760
You have similar builds, so I
expect that Miss Kihel's will fit her.

1040
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,890
They will fit her perfectly.
Or so I would think...

1041
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,560
What are you looking
so happy for?

1042
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,260
Keep a stiff upper lip.

1043
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,140
But I... You can see how I feel, right?

1044
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,700
I can. What you're saying isn't wrong.

1045
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,040
Be strong. My intention is
to set things on a better course.

1046
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,780
Harry... Help me.

1047
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:18,100
Miss Kihel! It's so good
to see you!

1048
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,970
And you, Miss Sochie!
Your mother is waiting!

1049
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:35,310
Um, if you'd like to pay your
respects, I'm sure they wouldn't mind.

1050
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:36,780
Wouldn't they?

1051
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,750
I think they would allow Queen
Dianna Soriel to offer her best wishes.

1052
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,060
Aren't you going to
show her the way, Laura?

1053
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,190
Of course!

1054
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,360
Excuse us!
It's Queen Dianna Soriel.

1055
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,660
Come in.

1056
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:59,060
Summer vacation seemed to
go on forever, didn't it?

1057
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,770
I've had too much homework
to come home before now.

1058
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,470
That's all right. Just seeing
your face makes me happy.

1059
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,280
Mistress, Miss Kihel has
come home, as well.

1060
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,710
Mother, forgive me. I have been
so busy at work.

1061
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:16,180
Are your studies going well at university?

1062
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,890
Of course. And I've made
many friends, as well.

1063
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,730
I'm alone with Sam and Jessica
in this huge house.

1064
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:23,960
I know.

1065
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,830
Your father is always in the
mountains expanding production.

1066
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,470
I know that he's working hard for
the country, so that's to be expected.

1067
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:39,870
I launched a war against a land
with people such as this in it?

1068
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,050
I am so terribly sorry.

1069
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,750
Your hands have gotten warmer, Kihel.

1070
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,350
Thank you, Mother.

1071
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:52,460
Sis, I think we should go
pay our respects to Father.

1072
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,890
Yes, of course.

1073
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:59,330
Tell your father not to worry
about the house, all right?

1074
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:00,530
We will.

1075
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,420
Miss Kihel?

1076
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,320
Father! Please forgive me!

1077
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:28,860
I'm so sorry for taking so
long to pay my respects!

1078
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,800
I thoughtlessly used my work as
an excuse to put off returning home.

1079
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,500
I am so terribly sorry.

1080
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:38,370
Please rest in peace.

1081
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,570
Miss Kihel...

1082
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,980
Queen Dianna Soriel...

1083
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,990
You truly mean those words, don't you?

1084
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:30,630
Harry is leaving...

1085
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:37,030
I'm sorry, Laura, but could you go
meet Sid and help with the excavations?

1086
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:40,330
Did they find something new
from the Dark History?

1087
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,770
Sochie, meet up with Col. Michael.

1088
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:44,640
Yes, sir!

1089
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:48,040
They say they've located a ship
capable of flying in space...

1090
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,540
...in Kingsley Valley near Aubany.

1091
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,580
Aubany?

1092
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,480
That certainly piques one's
curiosity, doesn't it, Loran?

1093
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,180
You want to come along?

1094
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,420
Col. Michael seems to be carrying
out an operation without my knowledge.

1095
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,620
I've heard of it.

1096
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,750
Miss Kihel,

1097
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,520
it's not bad that you see a
revolutionary artifact from the Dark History.

1098
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,730
Thank you!

1099
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,770
Miss!

1100
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,470
You heard him!
There's an operation!

1101
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,870
Well, this should be
usable in combat.

1102
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,510
No, we'll do it ourselves.

1103
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,320
Impossible! Even if you've gotten
yourselves a Moonrace FLAT,

1104
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,650
it's just the one!

1105
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:41,290
The Inglessan Militia is more than
enough to drive the Moonrace out of Nocis!

1106
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,660
We don't require
Lousana's assistance!

1107
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:48,130
This won't be anything like the
petty water disputes we've engaged in.

1108
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,240
Good, they've come!

1109
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,300
Who's come?

1110
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,410
Joseph!

1111
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,340
There!

1112
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,670
Mechanical dolls!

1113
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,980
Dianna Counter mechanical dolls are here?

1114
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,420
They were discovered in our territory,

1115
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,750
so we have named them Borjarnons!

1116
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:11,520
Excavations are still underway,
so their numbers will only grow!

1117
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:15,960
Even if we destroy that Soleil
ship, we won't lay claim to Nocis.

1118
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,070
Hello!

1119
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:18,730
What?

1120
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:21,610
I'm Gavane of the
Suicide Squad, Joseph.

1121
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,440
I operate the FLAT.

1122
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:25,230
Nice to meet you, Sochie Heim.

1123
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,770
You know who I am?

1124
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,240
You're the gallant lady pilot
who operates a Kapool, aren't you?

1125
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,610
Y-Yes, that's right.
Nice to meet you.

1126
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:44,090
Spirit of the Moon!

1127
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:50,160
Spirit of the Moon, be one with us!

1128
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,430
One with us! One with us!

1129
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,770
With our souls, be one!

1130
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,780
Be one! Be one!

1131
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,870
What are they dancing for?

1132
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:07,510
They're happy to be able
to serve Queen Dianna.

1133
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,380
Lt. Cmdr. Phil has a screw loose.

1134
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,080
Just because they say
they're descended from Moonrace,

1135
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,320
he lends them mobile suits...

1136
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,820
Who's in charge here?

1137
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,060
What is it?

1138
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,000
Sign here to acknowledge receipt
of the FLATs and WaDs!

1139
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,690
Sure, Cancer of the Rett team!

1140
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,360
Sorry about that!
Miss, are you all right?

1141
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:52,620
Rather shaken, but otherwise fine.
Where are we?

1142
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,290
This must be the underground
passage that Mr. Sid mentioned.

1143
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,300
Let's see where it leads.

1144
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,800
Fine.

1145
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:03,200
Is the White Doll all right?

1146
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,670
Yes. Wait here a moment!

1147
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,720
There's no sign of it!

1148
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,840
There sure isn't...

1149
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,020
If you can't find it, make it so you can!

1150
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:21,890
Smoke him out with those
railguns of yours!

1151
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,250
Roger that.

1152
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,570
The White Doll is providing
the perfect diversion,

1153
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:39,200
so we'll be able to drive
the Soleil out of Nocis.

1154
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:44,040
They'll never expect us to attack
without the White Doll.

1155
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,010
Leave out the Bull Ones.
They're too slow.

1156
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,280
It's a little late for that, Miashei.

1157
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,980
We'll follow you with our
mechanical doll squads.

1158
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,710
Right, Lt. Col. Mallygan?

1159
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:56,120
You can count on us.

1160
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:59,490
We have ideas for close-quarters
mechanical doll combat.

1161
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:02,260
We've been training in our
Borjarnons for just that!

1162
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,960
We won't let them give
you ladies a hard time.

1163
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:05,670
Oh, my!

1164
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,660
Tough talk, Suicide Squad...

1165
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,270
What of the returnees here?

1166
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:13,770
They'll be used as hostages
by Inglessa, I expect.

1167
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,140
And that is acceptable to you?

1168
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,710
We will retreat to the Sunbelt...

1169
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:22,110
...and claim that we require more
territory than we anticipated.

1170
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:25,950
And then negotiate down from there?

1171
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:32,490
What say you? I agree that the safety of the
returnees should come first, but...

1172
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,570
Could you arrange for one
last round of talks?

1173
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:37,990
With Lord Guin?

1174
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,230
Magistrate.

1175
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:44,770
When we meet, I should like to speak with
that secretary, Kihel Heim, once more.

1176
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:48,740
Understood. I will make the
necessary adjustments to your schedule.

1177
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,850
It's the white mobile suit!

1178
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:59,550
If I can break their legs...

1179
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,190
There was no sign
that he used a weapon...

1180
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,460
Loran! Are there many enemies?

1181
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,570
At least one more!

1182
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,300
If it's only the one,
shall I tell him to let us go?

1183
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,630
What did you say?

1184
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,910
Oh, I'm sorry.

1185
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:26,210
It's just that I've often been told
that I resemble the enemy's leader.

1186
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,980
Oops. That's not good!

1187
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,880
Everybody, get out of the tunnel! Get clear!

1188
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,690
What the hell?

1189
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,130
There's tunnels like this under here?

1190
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:44,530
I see people!

1191
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,670
I'm falling!

1192
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:52,380
Isn't there a way out?

1193
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,710
There's nowhere to run!

1194
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,300
- Isn't that the excavation team?
- Can we hide anywhere?

1195
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,380
It looks like there's
been a cave-in.

1196
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,110
An enemy doll came in
from the ceiling!

1197
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,720
That way's no good, either!

1198
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,780
Why not?

1199
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,590
There are still enemies there!

1200
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:07,920
How do we get out, then?

1201
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,500
I'll hold him off here, so you take
Miss Kihel and look for a way out.

1202
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,520
Loran!

1203
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,500
Don't do anything crazy, Loran!

1204
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,630
I sold the FLAT.

1205
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:24,800
We decided to live here as Earthers.
We need some seed money to do that.

1206
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,910
But how could you sell it?

1207
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,940
I want a chain of bakeries here on Earth!

1208
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:32,240
Isn't that a big undertaking?

1209
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,320
That's why I need the money.

1210
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,180
I understand that, but still...

1211
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,020
Isn't that across from the
airfield? What happened?

1212
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:46,260
The Militia must be attacking
the Moonrace settlement!

1213
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,220
I'll head back to the newspaper!

1214
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:50,860
- Fran, get clear!
- Keith!

1215
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:56,960
Where are they coming from?!

1216
01:12:57,110 --> 01:13:00,240
The northwest... and also from inside Nocis!

1217
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,900
Those are airplanes!

1218
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,480
Lt. Commander!

1219
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,880
It's an airplane squadron?!

1220
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,680
Is the Militia seriously
launching an all-out assault?

1221
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,280
More of a temper tantrum.

1222
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,520
Enemy mobile suit force closing in!

1223
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,890
What do we tell Queen Dianna?

1224
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,390
I will inform her.

1225
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,060
Put the Royal Guard on Soleil defense!

1226
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,900
The Phil Ackman team will halt
the Militia's mobile suits' advance,

1227
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,500
and then attack only
the Mountain Cycle to their rear.

1228
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,800
Don't lay a hand on the city.
It's going to be our capital.

1229
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:38,350
The Lt. Commander is an ambitious man.

1230
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,720
What?!

1231
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,590
Master Guin! We must evacuate!

1232
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,030
But the Dianna Counter is using this castle!

1233
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,220
Where has Lt. Harry gone?

1234
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,630
Into battle, ma'am.

1235
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:56,630
I see.

1236
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:59,000
Those are SUMO mechanical dolls...

1237
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,900
Loss of life is not to be
tolerated, even that of the enemy.

1238
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,770
They have been informed.

1239
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,780
The Air Corps?

1240
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,840
People are on those airplanes made
of canvas and wood! Do not target them!

1241
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,500
Get us above the Soleil, Miashei!

1242
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,470
Roger that!

1243
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,500
This attack is madness...

1244
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:37,770
Queen Dianna, please leave the bridge!

1245
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:42,150
The Soleil's presence at their
airfield is what is antagonizing them,

1246
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,780
so get us off the ground.

1247
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,510
Yes, ma'am!

1248
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:50,120
I'm not about to
stand idly by!

1249
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,950
Miss!

1250
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:55,080
Please stop this foolishness.

1251
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:59,490
I can't brace myself!

1252
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:04,570
You're tarnishing the Gundam name!

1253
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:09,600
The likes of you shouldn't be
allowed to use the white mobile suit!

1254
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,870
That's more like it!

1255
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,450
That was a cave-in!

1256
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:38,960
Lieutenant! Please give us
permission to engage directly!

1257
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,630
No direct targeting!

1258
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,000
Joseph, go from there!

1259
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,040
Suicide Squad, advance
from the left flank!

1260
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,580
Watch this!

1261
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:56,320
What squad do those on
our right flank belong to?

1262
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,520
What are those mobile suits
to the rear?!

1263
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:02,380
Boss, we're falling back!

1264
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,120
Mobile suits?

1265
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:13,300
Our cannons are hitting,
but they're having no effect?

1266
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,130
John! Bill! Fall back while
covering the other mechanical dolls!

1267
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:20,940
Lt. Harry!

1268
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,240
They've developed
mobile suits like those?

1269
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,240
Perhaps they were unearthed in Lousana.

1270
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,380
- Lousana?
- Soleil, lifting off!

1271
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:36,990
Tell the Suicide Squad!

1272
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,330
It'll take more than that!

1273
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,960
The Soleil is getting away!

1274
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,560
Tell the Suicide Squad!

1275
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,760
Let's chase it!

1276
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,000
Why are you stopping me?

1277
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:51,600
Calmly observe the enemy's
fighting strength, little lady!

1278
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,840
Nanoskin strips that were
covering the monitors?

1279
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:00,850
They'll work as well as before,
right? What should I do?

1280
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,320
I hope you aren't dead, Gundam!

1281
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,660
The White Doll
isn't gazing over me?

1282
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:19,870
Just look at the glow
of that magma!

1283
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,030
Do you see?

1284
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:28,870
Melting in that bubbling magma will let you
become one with your precious Earth!

1285
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:32,410
There's a memory in
my brain somewhere...

1286
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,640
...that a Gundam once
made a fool of me!

1287
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:38,310
I wanna get rid of it!

1288
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,820
I want to smash you all!

1289
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,790
Corin Nander!

1290
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,200
Your Majesty!

1291
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,800
Miss Kihel!

1292
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,870
Your mission has been
completed, Corin Nander.

1293
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,200
Now, leave us!

1294
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,240
That's not right, Majesty!

1295
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,470
It's the Gundam!
It's right here! See?!

1296
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:08,520
This is a different time,
and your mission is complete!

1297
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:12,020
If you do not obey my order,
I shall execute you!

1298
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,390
Y-Your Majesty!

1299
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:17,790
Withdraw this instant!

1300
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:20,890
You have atoned in full
for your crime!

1301
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,540
He didn't listen?!

1302
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,910
Fall! Fall into the magma
and melt away to nothing!

1303
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:38,040
Corin!

1304
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,810
You are continuing, so in the name
of Dianna Soriel, I will execute you!

1305
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:47,250
Majesty! Everything I've done,
I've done for your happiness!

1306
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,120
I never asked for that!

1307
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,290
Now!

1308
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:05,070
Don't fall!

1309
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,750
The symbol of Bostonia Castle has collapsed?

1310
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:36,100
The Dianna Counter's flying
warships are heading south!

1311
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:39,170
I've got 20/10 vision,
I can see that.

1312
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,280
Can't do much if they're flying...

1313
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:44,350
Is their plan to occupy the Sunbelt?

1314
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,750
Indeed. They fully intend
to live on this continent.

1315
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:52,510
If they didn't, they would have
completely wiped out Nocis.

1316
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,180
What now?

1317
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,920
Why don't we launch
an attack against the Moon?

1318
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,360
What?

1319
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:03,190
We've found mechanical dolls like
the Borjarnons among the Dark History relics.

1320
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:06,830
Meaning that we're sure to find a
warship that can fly to the Moon.

1321
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:12,300
Yes, I've heard something about you
using Moonrace engineers on Sid's teams.

1322
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,040
You've heard about that?

1323
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,240
May I enter?

1324
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,050
Go ahead.

1325
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,720
I would like you to go over the
draft of the statehood declaration, Majesty.

1326
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:30,690
Is it truly necessary to take the
Sunbelt as our own country?

1327
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:33,720
Yes. It is crucial
to avoiding a war.

1328
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,460
Very well.

1329
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,620
I will stop by first thing
in the morning, then.

1330
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:39,790
Of course.

1331
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:50,510
Will this allow the Moonrace and
people of Earth to coexist, Queen Dianna?

1332
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,950
According to the
Moonrace engineers,

1333
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,720
that spaceship will be
able to fly, Laura.

1334
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,920
Willghem isn't a name
for a warship, though.

1335
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,120
It depends on how it's used.

1336
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:14,700
The queen herself sent you an
invitation to tomorrow's ceremony.

1337
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,800
That's amazing!

1338
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,730
I'm not thrilled that it's
for Laura Rolla, though...

1339
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,240
That has its uses, too.

1340
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:31,290
I can't believe we have to listen
to the Dianna Counter declare their statehood.

1341
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,550
This means we've totally lost!

1342
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:37,920
It can't be helped. After all, even
Master Guin fled from Nocis.

1343
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:41,160
I'm glad that I got to see
you again, though...

1344
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,930
Miss Sochie! Your manners
are appalling!

1345
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,100
You're no fun.

1346
01:21:56,910 --> 01:22:01,180
Will Miss Kihel only become the
pawn of Miran and the others?

1347
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,790
Loran. Wake up.

1348
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:21,440
I sensed that something was off
about you. For a long time now.

1349
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,880
I've always respected Queen Dianna...

1350
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:33,210
And I admire Miss Kihel...

1351
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:38,550
How could I not tell you apart all this time?

1352
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,490
Kihel Heim is a woman of
great inner strength,

1353
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:46,930
so I find it unlikely that she
will let herself be Miran's pawn.

1354
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,530
When I think about what
will happen tomorrow...

1355
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:55,190
Miss Kihel is aboard the Soleil?
She is, isn't she...

1356
01:22:55,870 --> 01:23:02,970
I cannot imagine that she will be able to
take control of the return policy in my place.

1357
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:05,070
No...

1358
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,310
Loran Cehack.

1359
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,410
Please help me.

1360
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,660
We'll pay you back double!

1361
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,390
A likely story!

1362
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:26,730
Pops! I'm here to pick up the liquor!

1363
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,600
Hey, Pops! If you sleep here,
you're gonna catch cold!

1364
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:34,310
They said you guys were coming,
so I waited for you.

1365
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,430
Sorry about that.
Where's the owner?

1366
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,200
I'm waiting here in his place.

1367
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:42,880
The order's so big that the
supplier will deliver it directly.

1368
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,480
We just need to show
this at the rear gate, right?

1369
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:48,590
Good morning!

1370
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,890
I have one truck's worth for now.

1371
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,420
Can we take two trucks at once?

1372
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,950
Thanks, lady.

1373
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,330
You're coming, right?

1374
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:58,390
Of course!

1375
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,870
Nice to meet you.

1376
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,980
Where is the auto of Lousana's
Miss Lily Borjarno?

1377
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,810
On the road to the right.

1378
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:15,720
I know what you are up to.

1379
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,950
You find it amusing?

1380
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,280
You can't launch a guerilla
attack against the Soleil,

1381
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,290
not with lords from across
the continent present.

1382
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:23,790
Miss Lily!

1383
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,430
Miss Laura Rolla?

1384
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,300
Yes?

1385
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,970
Why don't you bring your mobile
suit over to our side?

1386
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,600
I think it would be faster
to mingle in with the Earthers.

1387
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,300
It's good to see
you safe, Master Guin!

1388
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:46,540
Miss Lily Borjarno, you are
as bewitching as ever.

1389
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:52,810
Miss Kihel, your servant Loran
has arrived with Queen Dianna.

1390
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:58,350
So, the Mustache is here
along with that Laura Rolla floozy?

1391
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:03,520
All these Earthers here for the ceremony
are turning this into a school festival!

1392
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:06,860
These are my two guests,
along with Lousana's Miss Lily.

1393
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,800
Unbelievable. These guys are so
tactless it's not even funny.

1394
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,870
How do I set it to
maximum magnification?

1395
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:21,650
Oh, that's the one?
That got it!

1396
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,150
The Inglessans' trucks got in?

1397
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:27,260
When Col. Michael gets started,

1398
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:30,190
it'll throw a wrench in
the Moonrace's plans!

1399
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,960
I will excuse myself.

1400
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,290
Do you have a message
from your father?

1401
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:40,100
He says to proceed as you see fit.
Where did Miss Kihel go?

1402
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,870
I mustn't be seen taking
any action here personally.

1403
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,500
What are you doing?
Hey, who are you?!

1404
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,840
Why, you!

1405
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,480
Well done.

1406
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:55,450
I wished to see how well my men
performed their duties.

1407
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,150
The Royal Guard
snuck her out in secret.

1408
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:59,210
I will go back up.

1409
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,260
This is the last of it!
Call over Mitchell's squad!

1410
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,420
Oh, come on! You can't even
handle this weak stuff?

1411
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:07,990
You should finish off this
last cask yourselves. Right?

1412
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:10,030
I said to carry that in!

1413
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:12,090
You call this booze?!

1414
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:14,790
On Earth, even children drink this.

1415
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,500
How are things going on your end?

1416
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,040
They're all offloaded.

1417
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,270
Good work.

1418
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:23,870
There's no pilot in that mechanical
doll that's holding up that striped curtain.

1419
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,550
Make it run wild.

1420
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:26,450
Will do.

1421
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,120
Yanny!

1422
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,110
Sir?

1423
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,690
It's time.

1424
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,420
Yes, sir!

1425
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,780
What about the woman?

1426
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:36,880
She's playing along with our plan.
You didn't bring her, Colonel?

1427
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,730
I had nothing to do with her.

1428
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,690
Really?

1429
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,890
Master Guin's in the ceremony pavilion.

1430
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:46,370
We'll roll the barrels with
99% alcohol towards the back.

1431
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,700
Down I go!

1432
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:51,870
Next!

1433
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,270
Let's use the elevator!

1434
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:58,350
We'll never get past any guarded area.

1435
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,010
After all, we have no idea what
sort of situation Miss Kihel is in.

1436
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:03,680
Thish ish the invoice?

1437
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,690
Too easy.

1438
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,290
Where are you going, baby?

1439
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:11,880
This bust is too tight...

1440
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,400
Internal power struggles?

1441
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:19,230
All right, time to go!

1442
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:20,340
Yes sir!

1443
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,670
Okay! Let's give them
what they asked for!

1444
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,020
That's the signal!
Fire at will, and then retreat!

1445
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,880
A Militia attack?

1446
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:43,790
Master Guin!

1447
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:44,560
A bombardment?

1448
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,220
I wasn't told about this operation!

1449
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,850
Neither was I!

1450
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,360
Enemy attack!

1451
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:51,590
Raise the barrier!

1452
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,760
Hang in there, petty officer!

1453
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,030
She should be one floor up.

1454
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,820
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay inside the tent!

1455
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,750
I could've fought if I had stolen
that mechanical doll!

1456
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:21,120
Stay put, Suicide Sochie.

1457
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:22,630
Suicide Sochie?!

1458
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:26,130
Even when fighting, one must
first gauge the situation.

1459
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:34,910
That was a decoy!

1460
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:46,920
I've found you at last,
Queen Dianna Soriel.

1461
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,720
Identify yourself.

1462
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,350
I'm afraid I can't do that.

1463
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:54,890
If you kill me, the Earth
Return Plan will...

1464
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:58,760
Not every Moonrace wants
to return to Earth!

1465
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,890
Did Agrippa Maintainer
put you up to this?

1466
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:02,270
It's nothing personal.

1467
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:05,870
Just die!

1468
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,580
She got away!
Are you hurt, Majesty?!

1469
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,620
What of the attack outside?

1470
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,820
What happened?

1471
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,980
I had the SUMOs and other suits
deal with it.

1472
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,430
No guests have been injured.

1473
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,870
Just one look!

1474
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,860
This deck is off limits!

1475
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:34,400
Get rid of her!

1476
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,300
Yes, sir!

1477
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,430
Harry, the elevator can't be used.
I will take those stairs.

1478
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:39,060
Yes.

1479
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:40,940
Take me to Queen Dianna!
Just for a second!

1480
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,140
Kihel Heim!
I insist you leave!

1481
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,510
Go on!

1482
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:47,410
- Queen Dianna is here...
- We're leaving! Stop pushing!

1483
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,370
It is clear.

1484
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:52,680
You're going to issue a
declaration of statehood?

1485
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:54,950
Kihel Heim?

1486
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:56,560
Queen Dianna.

1487
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,890
It is to improve relations
between the Earth and Moon.

1488
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:00,020
Truly?

1489
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,460
Of course.

1490
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,290
I-In that case... Tread lightly.

1491
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:04,930
Harry!

1492
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:05,990
Majesty?

1493
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,330
Let them return to Master Guin.

1494
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:09,960
- But Majesty!
- That is an order.

1495
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,300
Yes, Majesty.

1496
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:17,140
Our mother Earth was once
turned into such a wasteland...

1497
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:22,220
...that she became unfit
for human habitation.

1498
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:25,510
The Dark History tells us that
there was such a time!

1499
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:30,260
And yet, in spite of that, the children of
Earth forget this fact! Why is that?

1500
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,890
- This Moonrace is telling it like it is.
- Mankind's tragic nature is to forget...

1501
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,500
- Indeed she is.
- Mankind's tragic nature is to forget...

1502
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,730
...its most painful experiences and memories.

1503
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:45,530
Until the Earth was habitable once more,

1504
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,310
we Moonrace dwelled on the Moon.

1505
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,810
To bequeath our memories of mankind!
To aid in the rebirth of a new humanity!

1506
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:02,150
And today, after the passage of
some 2,000 years of history,

1507
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,920
the human race can now thrive
once again on Earth.

1508
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:10,220
And so, the Moonrace wishes to
return to the Earth to assist in her rebirth,

1509
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:14,730
and to make certain that this
mistake in our history is never repeated!

1510
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:19,640
Loran, Kihel Heim is spelling out
my true feelings better than I ever could.

1511
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:22,140
Yes, Ma'am. I think so, too.

1512
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,750
The people of Earth have built up
the strength to be reborn...

1513
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:30,550
...by spinning mankind's past march
into space into tales of gods in the heavens,

1514
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:33,190
or by sealing it away
in the Dark History.

1515
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:35,920
This is because mankind cannot
be reborn or rise again...

1516
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,560
...through a tragic,
cruel past alone.

1517
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,960
It is for this reason that we alter
our interpretation of historical facts,

1518
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:46,070
and, at times, rewrite history itself.

1519
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:47,870
Our bodies are...

1520
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:50,640
...no different from those of Earthers.

1521
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:54,910
This means that we will be able to
reunite into a single race one day.

1522
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:58,940
I have therefore decided not to
claim the Sunbelt as a Moonrace state...

1523
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:06,280
...and instead ask the people of
Ameria to reopen negotiations!

1524
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:11,620
Is that Dianna Soriel?

1525
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:16,190
Kihel Heim, I believe that I can
safely leave the Moonrace in your hands.

1526
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,560
Miss Kihel has come so far...

1527
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,090
Dianna Soriel!

1528
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,730
Say nothing.

1529
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,840
This will only embolden the Militia!

1530
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,370
Then we will defend ourselves
with noble ideals.

1531
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:32,870
Is she joking?! If that's Dianna's
plan, what use are we soldiers?!

1532
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,080
We're like buffoons
for her amusement.

1533
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:41,380
One can't keep a military in line
with noble ideals alone, Kihel Heim!

1534
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:45,580
Even a civilian like Kihel Heim,
Guin Lineford's personal secretary,

1535
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:50,090
wouldn't be as naively sentimental
as you just were, Queen Dianna.

1536
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,820
I want to tell you that.

1537
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:57,100
Do not compare that commoner to the
woman who holds the Moonrace together.

1538
01:32:57,470 --> 01:33:00,810
Only concern yourselves
with obeying your queen!

1539
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:04,510
Without orders from their bigwigs,
mechanical dolls like that...

1540
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:07,280
...are just showpieces and
nuisances. Right, Miss Lily?

1541
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,880
That's right.

1542
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:12,510
While we have even found an armored
vehicle that doesn't use wheels.

1543
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,390
Along with a flying battleship.

1544
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,490
Not here! That is classified.

1545
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:18,950
Master Guin?

1546
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,650
Is what she said true?

1547
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:25,320
We must prepare for the
eventuality that Dianna Soriel...

1548
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:27,370
...will be unable to control
her forces.

1549
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,440
That thing was one hell of a find.

1550
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:32,470
Ladderrum, it's really that big?

1551
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:33,270
Yeah.

1552
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,480
One, two, pull!

1553
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,480
This is that nanoskin stuff, right?

1554
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:47,580
Yes, it protected the machines
that were buried in the earth...

1555
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,490
And at the same time, it formed the
dirt that kept them hidden all these years?

1556
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:56,260
Huh? I don't get
how that works.

1557
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:01,340
I'm not surprised. Oh, the head of
that mustached mobile suit is damaged.

1558
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:05,130
That's where it gets strange. It
wasn't like that when it was first damaged.

1559
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:08,070
There's these blisters
on the surface.

1560
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:10,440
Then let's remove the head
and take a look.

1561
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:12,710
Loran, I opened the window
over here.

1562
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:14,820
You'll get dirty, Miss!

1563
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,350
- Surely a fluke resemblance...
- Laura!

1564
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:19,120
I'm making you the captain,

1565
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,250
so please get it up and running.

1566
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,590
You're the most qualified, aren't you?

1567
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,790
Queen Dianna...

1568
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:26,260
I am Kihel.

1569
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,130
We should take geopolitical
implications into account...

1570
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,070
...when establishing our borders,
is that what you are saying?

1571
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:42,940
Precisely. The initial proposed
territory boundaries will tip our hand.

1572
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,240
Why did you say so
before the speech?

1573
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:49,250
This recent incident reintroduced
me to the concept of geopolitics.

1574
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:51,190
My apologies.

1575
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:52,020
Of course.

1576
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,040
However...

1577
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:57,180
We cannot turn a blind eye to the
spaceship the Militia is excavating.

1578
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:59,820
I am considering the issue.
Harry and Miran.

1579
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,190
Majesty?

1580
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:08,730
Agrippa Maintainer, who is
entrusted with the capital city of Gengnham,

1581
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:11,840
has turned traitor along
with his entire clan?

1582
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:16,340
No, starting the Earthfall
operation signaled that times had changed.

1583
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,070
Which, in turn, altered the mindset
of the Maintainer clan.

1584
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:24,040
And this new mindset caused them
to send assassins to kill me?

1585
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:28,260
Do not forget Corin.
We should assume so.

1586
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:33,480
We can't allow the Soleil to remain
surrounded by those Militia savages.

1587
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:37,430
The Zenoa team has presented their
Lost Mountain survey findings?

1588
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,570
If we wait for that, we won't be
able to break free of the Soleil.

1589
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,830
You're still having second thoughts?

1590
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:44,970
Stop crying!

1591
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:46,570
I'm not crying, sir!

1592
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:51,800
Let's make our move,
Lt. Commander!

1593
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:56,180
You want the White Doll's
head set outside, then?

1594
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,620
We can manage after that.

1595
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:59,250
Hey, boss!

1596
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,150
Yes, what is it?

1597
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:05,320
Um, we're looking for the captain.
They said he was here.

1598
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:07,360
You know the captain?

1599
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,230
That's right!

1600
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,460
It is nice to meet you.
I'm Horace, chief engineer.

1601
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:14,730
Huh?

1602
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:17,770
Who are you?

1603
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:19,310
Are you Captain Loran?

1604
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:21,370
Mr. Horace kindly gave us referrals.

1605
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:23,270
Oh, you work here?

1606
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,550
They intend to fight anyway?

1607
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:42,020
Ah, thank you. Did you learn
Lt. Cmdr. Phil's plan?

1608
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,860
Yes. He says he intends
to drive off the Militia...

1609
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,160
...and seize the spaceship
that they excavated.

1610
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:52,900
Guin Lineford is
there now, is he not?

1611
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:57,610
Yes. Moonrace engineers
who defected are also there,

1612
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:59,980
so he intends to
capture them all.

1613
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:04,410
Where Lord Guin is, Kihel Heim
is sure to be at his side.

1614
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:07,580
It is likely.

1615
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,690
Are you not concerned for her safety?

1616
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:10,390
Indeed.

1617
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:13,590
As much as I am for yours.

1618
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:15,720
In that case, Harry Ord...

1619
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:16,800
Yes?

1620
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,260
Go to Kingsley Valley
and carry out your true duty.

1621
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,000
But I mustn't leave
your side now.

1622
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,470
Dianna Soriel has given you a direct order.

1623
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:30,710
Yes, Majesty.

1624
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:35,380
However, please return quickly.

1625
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:39,080
Of course, Majesty.

1626
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,090
What unit are you with?!
Stop tearing up the road!

1627
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:50,190
We're the Rett team,
an autonomous squad!

1628
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,360
The Zenoa survey team
is down this road, isn't it?

1629
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:58,130
This is no place for Moonrace who
went native on Earth! Get lost!

1630
01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:01,000
Bastard! Do you wanna get squashed?!

1631
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,010
Let's go.

1632
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:03,180
But, Boss!

1633
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,870
The Zenoa Team has found
some kind of treasure!

1634
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:08,070
In an empty wasteland like this?

1635
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:09,380
Do it!

1636
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,590
M-Moving out!

1637
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,720
Don't step on us!

1638
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:30,960
This makes three, huh?
Are there any more?

1639
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:34,040
The whole place is buried in
nanoskin! Send a WaD down, sir!

1640
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:35,300
Will do.

1641
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,980
Send these three mobile armors
to the Soleil!

1642
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:41,840
The Soleil isn't a repair shop, damn it...

1643
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:50,380
Idiot! Watch where you're driving!

1644
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:52,890
Sorry! I nodded off!

1645
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:55,460
You alone, missy?

1646
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,930
I'm a reporter for the Nocis
Chronicle! Give me an interview!

1647
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:00,900
Sure, come see me tonight!

1648
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,430
A Militia FLAT, huh?

1649
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:10,710
I've got it! That's the one
that Keith sold them!

1650
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,670
Mobile suits, Kapools,
and an armored hover vehicle...

1651
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:18,880
I knew it!

1652
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:21,480
You knew what?

1653
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,760
I-I'm with the Nocis Chronicle.

1654
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:26,050
You're a Moonrace, right?

1655
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,050
Did you come from the Moon
in this mechanical doll?

1656
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,060
O-Of course not!

1657
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,400
My grandparents might
have been, but I...

1658
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:38,500
You're Fran Doll the reporter, right?
I've read a couple of your articles.

1659
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,570
Thanks!

1660
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:41,140
You're a Moonrace for sure.

1661
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,180
Why would you insinuate that?

1662
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,010
I can tell those who are
out of the ordinary.

1663
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,310
You've even linked up with
Lousanan Borjarnons!

1664
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:53,480
Yeah.

1665
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,870
He's here!

1666
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,070
As a result of various factors...

1667
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:22,850
...I was forced to have my men
deliver the dress I got you as a gift.

1668
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:30,320
H-However, I hope to have you
stand at my left in that dress,

1669
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,390
and have come to
hear your answer.

1670
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,190
It's to the right.

1671
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:36,060
Don't get mad at him!

1672
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,430
I'm not mad.
Just wear it?

1673
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:44,100
N-No! My intention is
to make you my bride!

1674
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,540
Oh, that! Well, if that's
what you're asking,

1675
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:50,470
that's a big question, so I would
need time to think it over.

1676
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:51,740
Of course!

1677
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,180
Thank you, though.
I love it.

1678
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,850
I'm honored!

1679
01:40:56,990 --> 01:40:59,610
I need to discuss it
with my mother and sister.

1680
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:01,380
Of course!

1681
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,520
The mustached mechanical doll is
able to power such a large ship?

1682
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:11,430
No, they're simply going to
jump-start it using the White Doll's engine.

1683
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:15,060
What a clever idea, using the
White Doll as a starter...

1684
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:23,470
Poe! Don't destroy the
Dark History relic!

1685
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:25,200
We need to study it!

1686
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:28,580
I know, we're to capture it along
with all the Moonrace engineers!

1687
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,090
They didn't even notice my
approach. Whatever shall I do with them?

1688
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,200
Give it more power!

1689
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,160
Good! A little more!

1690
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:54,080
Do we have it?

1691
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:54,800
Yes!

1692
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:58,500
They're lit!

1693
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,880
Let me through!

1694
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:05,220
Good work!

1695
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:08,520
Once you've stowed those tubes,
stand watch in the White Doll!

1696
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:09,620
Roger!

1697
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,300
- To think that humanity had to forget...
- This is great!

1698
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:16,430
- ...this part of their heritage...
- They say this can take us into space?

1699
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:17,700
Excuse me.

1700
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:18,500
Yes?

1701
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:20,720
If I might have a word, Miss?

1702
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,030
That voice...

1703
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,000
When a machine is running,
one has an urge to touch it.

1704
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:26,330
That is true.

1705
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:29,540
Was it like this with the
White Doll, Sochie?

1706
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:33,080
It's less than half as impressive,
but this is much bigger.

1707
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,200
How true.

1708
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:37,910
This mobile suit's hidden potential
is amazing... Huh?

1709
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:41,320
Who's she leaving with?
That's strange.

1710
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,010
I am asking you to leave
this area immediately!

1711
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:45,990
If you stop Phil's attack...

1712
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,590
I can't do that!

1713
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:48,430
What's he... Stop that!

1714
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:50,360
Get away from her!

1715
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,900
Don't interfere!

1716
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,200
This is Lt. Harry.

1717
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,040
Harry? The Royal Guardsman?

1718
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:01,040
He came to inform me that this
valley is about to be attacked.

1719
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,010
Does that mean you're deserting the
Royal Guard and joining the Militia?

1720
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:06,170
Don't be absurd!

1721
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:08,810
Then you're here to
abduct Miss Kihel.

1722
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:09,880
She's Queen Dianna!

1723
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,980
She's Miss Kihel here.

1724
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,950
They're testing the spaceship's engines!

1725
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:16,650
Next to that valley?

1726
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:18,090
Captain, look at this!

1727
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:18,960
What is it?

1728
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,090
They look like Dianna Counter
Scarecrows to me.

1729
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:24,860
What? We still have cargo to offload.

1730
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:31,340
- John! Aims! Have them bring us weapons!
- Defensive positions! Climb up the valley!

1731
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:32,640
Make them hurry!

1732
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,830
Don't drop anyone!

1733
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:35,970
Grab on!

1734
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:38,400
- We have to get to our Kapools!
- Enemies spotted!

1735
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:42,370
Send up the Suicide Squad, too!
The White Doll, too!

1736
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,420
Enemy numbers?

1737
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:46,150
Ten mechanical dolls, of which
five are jumbo Scarecrows!

1738
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:53,020
That was a big help, showing me how
to use this FLAT properly, Fran Doll.

1739
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,530
Come on, you can let me observe
the battle from here!

1740
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:57,600
You aren't a soldier!

1741
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,330
But I...

1742
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,960
You can report on how we fight
just as well from the outside.

1743
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:03,400
Joseph?

1744
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:05,230
We'll be fighting Moonrace.

1745
01:44:06,210 --> 01:44:08,180
Don't die, Joseph!

1746
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:18,250
Beginning containment attack!

1747
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:19,010
Ready!

1748
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,160
Queen Dianna, please
leave with Lt. Harry.

1749
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:31,960
Can you protect the spaceship?

1750
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:34,230
Of course. Good luck.

1751
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:35,390
And you.

1752
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:37,060
The next one's gonna hit!

1753
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:41,010
Let's try that Hyper Vibration
that Fran Doll mentioned!

1754
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,370
This thing's Vulcans can't
keep up with missiles!

1755
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,710
What's keeping the Militia?!

1756
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:58,730
If what Mr. Horace said is right, I
can channel the I-field into the shield...

1757
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,290
This way?

1758
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:02,730
Left side! A beam?
Wow...

1759
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:14,640
I-field, activated!
React automatically to alerts, set!

1760
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,210
Locate enemy!

1761
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:21,910
The Mustache put up a barrier?
It can even do that?

1762
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,480
Militia scum!

1763
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,320
If they fire a beam,
block it with missiles!

1764
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:34,160
Kapool squad, stay behind me!

1765
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,590
They think the Militia has the
firepower to drive me off?!

1766
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:42,600
Go!

1767
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:56,610
Miss, you need to get back!

1768
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,780
Mr. Horace!

1769
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:05,590
Oh, no! The airship!

1770
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,890
Kapool squad, please stay put!

1771
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,100
Ow, that's hot!

1772
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:21,000
That's the rifle they unearthed?

1773
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:30,380
Why am I being forced to
protect our enemies?

1774
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:33,850
Poe will be the only one to attack
via mega particle cannon!

1775
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:36,150
We will capture the spaceship
and return with it!

1776
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,520
Don't worry about the little stuff!

1777
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:41,130
Lt. Harry can help.

1778
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:43,660
There is nothing
to impede our liftoff?

1779
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,060
Activate power source!

1780
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,790
The cliff won't collapse, will it?

1781
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:48,930
We must leave before it does.

1782
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:52,130
But won't we be fired on as
soon as we leave the ground?

1783
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:56,070
The Dianna Counter wouldn't do
something as foolish as destroying this ship.

1784
01:46:56,180 --> 01:47:01,110
So we can stop the fighting if we
plow this baby into the thick of it.

1785
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:02,480
Can we?

1786
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,780
It's from the Dark History, after all.

1787
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:10,020
Anti-aircraft corps, fire!

1788
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,460
If I can get a great shot...
I'll be dead by then!

1789
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:20,400
Lt. Cmdr. Phil doesn't know
that Queen Dianna is here!

1790
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,200
Harry!

1791
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,980
The relic is moving?

1792
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:40,340
Oh, my. Isn't that golden
mechanical doll an enemy?

1793
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:45,090
The Mustache is here?

1794
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:56,840
Here we...

1795
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,030
...go!

1796
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:01,330
Okay, then!

1797
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:05,080
I'll flatten you!

1798
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,020
Sochie! Are you okay?!

1799
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,350
That was awesome, Gavane!

1800
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:14,280
No, we aren't armed
with ray guns!

1801
01:48:18,190 --> 01:48:22,360
That's two! Col. Michael, tighten
your defense around the Willghem!

1802
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:26,930
Nozzles?

1803
01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:29,730
Temperatures normal.
Should it be shaking like this?

1804
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:31,740
I know it's risky. Mr. Horace!

1805
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:33,500
It seems to be fine.

1806
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,710
All personnel, we're lifting off!

1807
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,910
Sochie, the Willghem's breaking
free! There's still two more Scarecrows!

1808
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:52,260
So, have you won?

1809
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:54,250
I'm not quite that optimistic.

1810
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:57,090
You're not getting off the ground!

1811
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,030
The Mustache?!

1812
01:49:06,070 --> 01:49:07,510
Loran! Are you okay?

1813
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:08,840
Are you still good to go, Loran?

1814
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,410
Laura, buy us time!

1815
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:11,970
I know!

1816
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:16,210
But I'm not your Laura and I'm not your tool!

1817
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,210
Loran!

1818
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,970
I-It got my legs!

1819
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:32,930
Lt. Commander!

1820
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:58,630
It's flying...
The relic is flying...

1821
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:07,790
The Dark History relic is flying?

1822
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:10,530
Yes, at an altitude of 80 meters!

1823
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,110
I can see that!

1824
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:13,300
I'm sorry, sir!

1825
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,840
Are you unhurt?

1826
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:23,310
I don't think that Miss Kihel
walks around quite so much.

1827
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:26,850
Queen Dianna?

1828
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:29,010
When did she leave the ship?

1829
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,500
Where did you go, Majesty?

1830
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:44,090
Do I not always say that evading you has
become a game with which to amuse myself?

1831
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:46,710
She got me again...

1832
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,130
Kihel Heim!

1833
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:52,880
Queen Dianna!

1834
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:55,680
Thank you! Thank you for
all your hard work!

1835
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:59,880
Surely it was harder
for you out there!

1836
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:02,920
Any difficulties I had
were of my own making.

1837
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:04,350
You were amazing,

1838
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:08,190
keeping the Soleil pinned here
while dealing with the constant troubles...

1839
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:11,030
...brought upon you
by my own forces!

1840
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:14,900
Your actions have prevented the Dianna Counter
from committing any grave sins.

1841
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,500
You truly think so,
Your Majesty?

1842
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:23,140
Please do not refer
to me so, Kihel.

1843
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:25,170
Of course, Queen Dianna.

1844
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:28,520
It must have been most difficult
to learn about the Moon,

1845
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:32,320
study the military, and examine
my relationships with others.

1846
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:36,690
It was. I surreptitiously learned
how to read your computer data files.

1847
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:41,060
I also took the liberty of
reading your private files.

1848
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,190
You are Dianna,
so that is only natural.

1849
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:48,430
I have come to realize that
a long life is no blessing!

1850
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:52,130
Do not say that. There is much that
is not contained in those files.

1851
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:56,040
In my past, there were
many joyous events, too.

1852
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,780
Queen Dianna...

1853
01:51:59,110 --> 01:51:59,880
Who is it?

1854
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,400
Lt. Harry Ord.

1855
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,220
Is everything all right?

1856
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,810
Of course. Thank you.

1857
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:10,290
It was nothing.

1858
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:12,560
Thank you for protecting Kihel.

1859
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,060
Think nothing of it.

1860
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,820
Say, Mottke... Does this remind
you of our homeland, the Moon?

1861
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:21,490
Except the sun doesn't
shine like this.

1862
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:26,770
They're digging all over the place,
but there's no sign of Zenoa himself!

1863
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:31,210
They should've let us handle this
job since we're used to living on Earth!

1864
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:32,250
Move out!

1865
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:33,180
Yes, ma'am!

1866
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:01,410
There are Dark History relics
in a place like this?

1867
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:05,030
Commander Gavane, we found a shaft
below us that goes further in!

1868
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,800
You did? Is it deep?

1869
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:11,690
And how! This shaft must have
been made for a special reason.

1870
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:15,810
Okay, that's enough!

1871
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,020
Where have you
been goofing off?

1872
01:53:18,130 --> 01:53:20,250
You didn't find my sister?

1873
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:24,060
I think she was taken by that
golden mechanical doll.

1874
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,190
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

1875
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:26,430
How can you say that...

1876
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:27,870
...so casually?

1877
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,340
That mechanical doll didn't do...

1878
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:31,710
We've got trouble!

1879
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:35,200
Gavane's squad has bumped into
a Dianna Counter team!

1880
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:36,280
They did?

1881
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:38,400
They're excavating at the Lost Mountain.

1882
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:41,880
That's a mountain that we
prospectors stay well clear of.

1883
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:43,070
Then let's head out!

1884
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:45,010
Miss, don't rush out just yet!

1885
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:46,020
Why not?!

1886
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:47,820
They're in a standoff.

1887
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:50,750
In any case, we should at least
send in the Gallop, right?

1888
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:54,280
Joseph's Jalapy Squad has to
stay and guard the Willghem.

1889
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,060
R-Right!

1890
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,670
Sochie, take command of the Gallop.

1891
01:53:58,670 --> 01:53:59,430
Okay.

1892
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:00,730
Okay, Loran?

1893
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:01,940
Let's do that.

1894
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:02,800
Yes, sir...

1895
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,730
Did you get pictures?

1896
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:07,240
Yes, Commander Zenoa.

1897
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,200
You say you found something
strange? Let's have a look.

1898
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:11,910
A missile or bomb
container, maybe?

1899
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:14,110
That's the mark for
radiological hazard, isn't it?

1900
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:16,110
What're the things on the racks?

1901
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,720
Must be cases for
nuclear engine fuel pellets.

1902
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:20,510
These are ancient relics!

1903
01:54:20,650 --> 01:54:22,950
Show me the underground
scans you took.

1904
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:26,080
Was there anything that looked
like a nuclear power facility?

1905
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:27,990
No, I didn't see
anything like that.

1906
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:32,830
Which would make the things on the
racks nuclear missiles or nuclear bombs?

1907
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:35,000
Mobile suits? Whose?

1908
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,670
What?

1909
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:37,240
That sounds like a landslide!

1910
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,700
We haven't scouted this shaft!

1911
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,340
You mustn't fight!

1912
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:50,440
Tell the Militia people, too!
If we fight here, we all die!

1913
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:53,880
Commander!
Dianna Counter forces!

1914
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:56,490
They're digging up relics!

1915
01:54:56,590 --> 01:55:01,530
Let's make them give anything
they dug up on Earth to us!

1916
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,460
We have to make the
Zenoa team understand that!

1917
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:12,330
Spirit of the Moon!

1918
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:26,310
If we don't hurry, Gavane and
his squad will be in trouble!

1919
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:28,050
The throttle is the
lever on the right.

1920
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:30,990
You should go get ready to
head out in the Kapool, Miashei.

1921
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,330
Did the Militia people understand?

1922
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:37,130
I think so.

1923
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,270
Might as well try...

1924
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:41,140
They moved!

1925
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:42,630
That's amazing!

1926
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:47,540
Every one contains a warhead...

1927
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:52,800
E-Eight of them! These warheads
can't possibly be dead!

1928
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:57,350
Muron! This calls for all units
being armed and ready!

1929
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:05,020
All I can see is the Zenoa team,
but what's going on underground?

1930
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,390
I'm getting a bunch
of metallic readings!

1931
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:11,590
Cancer, didn't the message from the
Zenoa team say they'd run into the Militia?

1932
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:16,170
There's a shaft down there! They're
hiding in it, so flush them out!

1933
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:17,700
Commander, look!

1934
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:29,080
Don't fight, my ass!
Commander, they fired on us!

1935
01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:33,150
I'm not surprised! Even a headless
Scarecrow is a threat to us!

1936
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:36,880
Aims! Don't listen to a word
the people down there tell you!

1937
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:44,960
One unit destroyed!

1938
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:48,190
Commander!
They're digging up treasure!

1939
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:55,600
So that's why they made that fake
threat that we would all die if we fought!

1940
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,670
Mr. Horace! Make sure Miss Sochie
keeps an eye on those mobile suits...

1941
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,010
...to our left flank!

1942
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:04,380
I've told her.
Captain Sochie!

1943
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,490
Don't suck up by
calling me captain!

1944
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:07,720
I think it suits you, personally.

1945
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:09,380
Don't wreck my Kapool!

1946
01:57:09,590 --> 01:57:11,520
I know! Launching!

1947
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:17,660
Loran's taken up position in front
of us. Ladderrum, slow us down.

1948
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:18,460
Got it!

1949
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:20,400
Mr. Horace! You have
Jacop and Bruno acting as...

1950
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,970
...our gun batteries, right?

1951
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:23,530
They're moving now.

1952
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,130
This is the Lost Mountain, Loran?

1953
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:30,370
It must be! The terrain is
just like on the Moon!

1954
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:40,210
Didn't I tell you that if we
fight in here, we'll all die!

1955
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:42,620
Don't give me that!

1956
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:47,590
What the hell?
There's nothing in here!

1957
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:49,330
Bombs?

1958
01:57:49,330 --> 01:57:50,920
You mustn't touch those!

1959
01:57:55,570 --> 01:57:59,400
If you don't know what they are,
then at least do as I say!

1960
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:03,000
If you're that panicked, there must
be a story behind these old bombs.

1961
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:04,800
How powerful are they?

1962
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:07,710
These are nuclear bombs!

1963
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,580
We all have to evacuate
the area immediately!

1964
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:13,410
Sure thing!
Aims! We're falling back!

1965
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,310
But with spoils of war!

1966
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:19,660
- You fools! What are you...
- Stand aside, Pops!

1967
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,630
Reinforcements are here, huh?

1968
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:24,800
Sounds that way.

1969
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,370
Hold onto these, Commander!

1970
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:27,330
Will do!

1971
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:33,470
Stand back, Zenoa team!

1972
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:38,210
The Rett team will finish off
these Militia puppets!

1973
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:40,880
The Rett team is here, too?!

1974
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:45,610
There were two left!
Tell them not to fight!

1975
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:48,820
We'll grab those two!

1976
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:49,860
No way, sir!

1977
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:52,120
We have to run a function check!

1978
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:53,780
And what if they're armed?

1979
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:56,720
We drop them and run!

1980
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:00,900
These two haven't been armed...

1981
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:04,760
But some of the ones the
Militia took might be!

1982
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:09,380
Gramps! Are you okay?

1983
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:10,740
This is nothing!

1984
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:12,750
Mottke! Deal with that Militia Zaku!

1985
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:13,910
We're on it!

1986
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:15,720
You puny Zaku!

1987
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,680
I have a lock!

1988
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:22,990
Those fools!

1989
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:25,580
Direct mobile suit hits are taboo!

1990
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:28,990
A mobile suit exploded!

1991
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:31,420
Was that a bomb?

1992
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:32,600
What?

1993
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,700
They shut themselves?

1994
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:34,940
Automatically?

1995
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:37,060
A mobile suit's engine exploded!

1996
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:39,740
What was that explosion?!

1997
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:43,070
It looks like the automatic
defense system kicked in...

1998
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:49,210
You wish me to continue to act
as your double aboard the Soleil?

1999
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:53,480
It has become necessary to assemble
a group whom I can truly trust...

2000
01:59:53,620 --> 01:59:56,420
...and ascertain the state
of affairs on the Moon.

2001
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:59,590
But I am a mere
miner's daughter...

2002
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:03,250
Given the many conspiracies
in motion on the Moon,

2003
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:08,060
it is vital to allow Queen Dianna
to work covertly for the time being.

2004
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,200
Yes. For the sake of peace
between the Earth and the Moon.

2005
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:15,740
In order to make the two
worlds a single nation.

2006
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:19,700
Aims! John! Cover me!

2007
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:26,390
Tail nozzles!
They're not activating!

2008
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:30,850
Aims! John!

2009
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:35,550
Watch close, you
Dianna Counter elitists!

2010
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:44,100
Rett team, Militia pilots,
listen to me!

2011
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:48,170
The bombs stored at the Lost Mountain
are terrible things called nuclear weapons!

2012
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,910
When it comes to fighting...

2013
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:52,500
...the Rett team sees it through!

2014
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:56,450
All Zenoa team members, fall back!

2015
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:59,410
Evacuate from the
Lost Mountain at top speed!

2016
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:01,520
Gallop, there was a Zenoa team...

2017
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,490
We intercepted it!

2018
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:04,160
No, Miashei!

2019
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:06,150
Fall back!

2020
02:01:06,690 --> 02:01:09,460
Gavane's Suicide Squad
is fighting for their lives!

2021
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:17,330
One nuke is powerful enough
to wipe Nocis off the map!

2022
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:25,380
Aren't you dead yet?!

2023
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:28,410
Kane getting killed
was a miscalculation!

2024
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:29,850
What do we do, Aims?

2025
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:30,910
You do nothing!

2026
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,150
Suicide Squad, retreat!

2027
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:35,980
Nukes are terrifying for their
power, also for their poison!

2028
02:01:36,290 --> 02:01:38,950
We have to assist Commander
Gavane to secure the bombs!

2029
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:40,530
Don't even joke about that!

2030
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:44,100
They spread a poison that lasts
for one or two centuries!

2031
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:45,490
Rett team members!

2032
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:49,070
As Moonrace, you should know
how terrible nukes are!

2033
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:52,440
Mottke! Bury that Militia
mobile suit!

2034
02:01:52,570 --> 02:01:54,440
I'll take out
the Mustache myself!

2035
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,580
You're not running?

2036
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:57,600
I will!

2037
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:03,810
I'll slice up this
stubborn person first!

2038
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:06,450
Don't mess with me,
mustached doll!

2039
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:12,990
You're not getting your way here!

2040
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,700
Get away from here!

2041
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:30,480
Boss!

2042
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:31,570
W-Withdraw!

2043
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:46,420
I can't pick him out from all the
underground metallic readings...

2044
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:50,720
Gavane Goonny!
Get clear!

2045
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:58,660
The Zenoa team isn't sending us
any solid data.

2046
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:00,610
Could they be tactical nukes?

2047
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:02,040
I think there's various levels.

2048
02:03:02,610 --> 02:03:04,270
All we can do
is say our prayers.

2049
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:08,480
Why won't you let me fight?!
Gavane's still fighting!

2050
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:12,350
There's no turning back.
We're doing as Mr. Horace says.

2051
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:15,180
These things are terrifying bombs.
We're in danger ourselves.

2052
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:18,420
Gavane's fighting out there!
This is stupid!

2053
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:22,230
We ourselves might be destroyed
by those stupid weapons.

2054
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:26,360
Do we really have to
leave this quickly?

2055
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:28,160
It might already
be too late.

2056
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:30,200
Think the commander
made it out?

2057
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:32,000
Sure, this is our commander
you're talking about!

2058
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:38,940
If everybody had put on normal suits,
they'd be protected from the radiation.

2059
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:59,090
There it is!

2060
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,300
That's...

2061
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,200
It's turned into day!

2062
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:06,970
Is this it?!

2063
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:08,500
That can't be a bomb!

2064
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:19,190
This is a bomb blast?

2065
02:04:20,050 --> 02:04:23,220
The Gallop must have been
constructed with nuclear warfare in mind.

2066
02:04:33,230 --> 02:04:35,570
It almost looks like
dawn breaking...

2067
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:42,510
That's pretty close.

2068
02:04:43,610 --> 02:04:45,840
That is definitely a nuke.

2069
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,480
A dawn at midnight is an anomaly
that must never be.

2070
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:05,350
No way... We've been trying
to return to Earth.

2071
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:07,830
How could there be tools
like that here?

2072
02:05:09,970 --> 02:05:14,030
Why would anyone build
something like that?!

2073
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:20,070
I don't want to turn over the
remaining nukes to Lt. Cmdr. Phil,

2074
02:06:20,210 --> 02:06:21,870
so dispose of them for me!

2075
02:06:22,010 --> 02:06:24,030
You're giving these
to your enemies?

2076
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:26,200
Nuclear weapons
don't discriminate!

2077
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:29,470
I'm being followed,
so I'm giving them to you!

2078
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:33,480
Loran!

2079
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:44,460
Please don't go off...

2080
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:16,090
Which direction is the place
that the blast happened, Loran?

2081
02:07:29,110 --> 02:07:38,980
Gavane! Don't I look pretty in
the wedding dress you gave me?!
