00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:04,684
{\an8}(exciting orchestral music)

2
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,876
(gong rings)

3
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:12,083
Men of Shao-Lin, the 10 disciples,

4
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:16,353
five of them monks and five laymen,

5
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:17,222
are now prepared.

6
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:20,058
Their studies are complete.

7
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,195
Give them your instructions.

8
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,503
Buddha loves wisdom,

9
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:34,872
the true reflection,

10
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:36,440
the way of Shao-Lin

11
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:38,443
reflects that wisdom.

12
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,811
Remember that,

13
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,780
respect the way,

14
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,082
be true Shao-Lin.

15
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,352
Now you go out into the world,

16
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,521
always be merciful,

17
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,089
and practice kindness.

18
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,260
[All] Sir, we'll do as you say.

19
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:59,330
God's name be praised.

20
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01,332
[Men] God's name be praised.

21
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:06,338
(gong rings)
(exciting orchestral music)

22
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,251
I will take you in to meet the abbot.

23
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:21,886
[Woman] Thank you very much.

24
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,721
Please.

25
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,695
(chanting)

26
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,541
Liu Shaoin, pleased to meet you.

27
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,545
God's name be praised.

28
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:50,614
So, you have come for your master.

29
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,950
Two years ago, Uncle Chang and myself

30
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,653
accompanied our master here.

31
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:57,588
We said then when the time was right

32
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,589
that we would return.

33
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,959
The time has come.

34
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,061
Mm, I have come to fetch you master.

35
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:07,731
Aye, times have changed.

36
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,633
The Ming has been defeated.

37
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:10,635
No, master,

38
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,538
the Ming cause is not defeated.

39
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,341
Everything is prepared, we await your return.

40
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:18,842
Oh?

41
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:20,077
Once you are with us

42
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:23,114
our armies will march on the road to victory.

43
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:26,350
And General Chang has been working all this time?

44
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,185
Yes.

45
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:31,056
The heavens are guiding our cause.

46
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,359
Abbot, I don't know how to repay you

47
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,860
for your kindness.

48
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:37,795
It was nothing,

49
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,698
I was merely doing my duty.

50
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,701
Shao-Hua, let us leave now.

51
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:46,036
No, their spies are everywhere.

52
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:47,972
They saw me coming here.

53
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,640
They'll be watching my return.

54
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,075
You cannot come with me,

55
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:52,109
but I have another idea.

56
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,278
I'll take the responsibility

57
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,880
for assuring you a safe journey.

58
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,983
Ah, good, then I shall leave here first.

59
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,284
On the second of next month,

60
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:02,720
we'll meet at Whitestone town.

61
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,724
(gentle horn music)

62
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,060
Chi-Yung.

63
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,261
Master?

64
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,630
Tomorrow you are to leave here.

65
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:15,333
You are to protect the master

66
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:18,235
with your life, if need be.

67
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,304
He's most valuable.

68
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:21,840
Take every precaution.

69
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,608
Do you understand?

70
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:25,876
I understand.

71
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:27,745
I'll take care of it.

72
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,179
Remember,

73
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,050
no matter what else is happening at the time,

74
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,552
you guard his life and make sure

75
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,955
he gets through to his destination

76
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:38,857
at all costs.

77
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:39,691
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:44,696
(grunts)

79
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,924
(yells)

80
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,727
God go with you.

81
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:21,098
Good luck, and take good care of him.

82
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,766
[Chi-Yung] Yes, sir.

83
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,601
Good bye.

84
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,203
Thank you for everything.

85
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:30,642
(exciting dramatic orchestral music)

86
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,699
(dramatic sinister orchestral music)

87
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:10,415
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,720
What's the matter?

89
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,956
[Man In Black] A pigeon from Shao-Lin Monastery.

90
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,791
Oh?

91
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,527
Show in the commander!

92
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:27,265
(dramatic orchestral music)

93
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,715
Sir, a message has arrived from Shao-Lin by pigeon.

94
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:46,017
Mm.

95
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,090
Dismissed.

96
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,025
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:58,028
[Chin-Hoo] Sir.

98
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,530
Mm.

99
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,364
Sir.

100
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,968
The letter tells us,

101
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:07,839
"King Chiu has left
for Whitestone town."

102
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,910
He leaves Shao-Lin at last.

103
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,547
They have harbored that traitor all this time

104
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:18,415
despite your requests that he be

105
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,251
handed over to you.

106
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:23,020
Now that he has left the temple,

107
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,689
it's our chance to strike.

108
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,090
I think we should stop him

109
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,326
from getting to Whitestone town

110
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,496
before it is too late for us.

111
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:40,405
(dramatic exciting orchestral music)

112
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:38,463
(dramatic sinister orchestral music)

113
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,531
(chuckles)

114
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:43,534
I'm glad you know your way.

115
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,870
We've been waiting here for some time now

116
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:50,140
for you to arrive at this crossroads.

117
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,975
But how did you know that we'd be coming?

118
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:54,278
It's the only way to Whitestone town.

119
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,247
That is where you're going, isn't it?

120
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:01,218
Mm.

121
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,052
Sir!

122
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,320
Charge!

123
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:07,225
(dramatic intense orchestral music)

124
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,268
Take him!

125
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,504
[Men] Sir, sir!

126
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,505
(yelling)

127
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:25,943
(thudding)
(swishing)

128
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:30,547
Don't let them escape!

129
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:31,949
Right, come on!

130
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,753
(swords swishing)

131
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,689
Come on!

132
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,692
(yells)

133
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:46,764
(swords clanging)
(thudding)

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,135
(groans)

135
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:03,581
(swords swishing)

136
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,885
(grunting)

137
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,420
[Men] Humbly, comrade.

138
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,521
My brothers.

139
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,789
[Men] Humbly.

140
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,825
The abbot didn't think it was going to be easy,

141
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:17,294
so he told us to go along in case.

142
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:19,029
I'm glad that you did.

143
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,731
That was most thoughtful of him.

144
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,866
Well, my brothers, are you coming with us?

145
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,801
No, well, we will go on ahead,

146
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:27,138
while you two make a detour to throw them off.

147
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:29,172
We'll see you later.

148
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,340
All right, good bye.

149
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:31,174
Good bye.

150
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,009
Bye, see you.

151
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:37,914
Thanks, come on.

152
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:38,750
Yeah, right.

153
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:47,158
(dramatic sinister orchestral music)

154
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,532
Forgive me, sir,

155
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,768
please, please.

156
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,304
Please, sir.

157
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,840
(smacking)

158
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:04,675
Ah, ah, no, no.

159
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,245
Oh, please, please, sir, please.

160
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,146
Brigadier Lan.

161
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,914
At your command, sir.

162
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,616
You lead the guard in attack.

163
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,117
They must be stopped.

164
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:15,486
If you fail, death!

165
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:17,287
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:17,288 --> 00:13:18,155
Brigadier Ching.

167
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,623
Yes, sir.

168
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,092
You had better advise Brigadier Chow,

169
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,827
help is on the way.

170
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:26,530
He's to go to Whitestone town right away,

171
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,865
and wait for them to fall into the net.

172
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:29,700
Yes, sir.

173
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,036
Father, let me go.

174
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:35,406
I'm sure that I can capture this impostor Chiu.

175
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,082
Hmm, all right,

176
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,685
but your uncle's to go with you.

177
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:49,886
Yes, sir.

178
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:50,821
Commander,

179
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:52,689
all the monks have betrayed you.

180
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,891
They refuse to hand him over.

181
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:57,461
Supposing we were to threaten the abbot himself,

182
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,930
he will be forced to give up Chiu to us then.

183
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,631
It wouldn't cause us so much trouble,

184
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,099
and you could kill the two birds

185
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,569
with just the one stone.

186
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,977
All right, you go to Shao-Lin Monastery immediately.

187
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,347
Warn the abbot to call in all his monks.

188
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:20,283
Remember, I want that man alive!

189
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:25,289
(exciting orchestral music)
(hooves thudding)

190
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,521
(dramatic orchestral music)

191
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:16,006
My name is Chin-Hoo

192
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:17,775
from the commander's headquarters.

193
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,878
God's name be praised.

194
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:24,581
And what brings you to our monastery,

195
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:25,982
may I ask?

196
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,350
The commander orders you

197
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,586
to hand over Chiu.

198
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:33,189
Mr. Chiu left
here some time ago.

199
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,391
Then I must ask,

200
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,126
where are the 10 disciples

201
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:37,695
who have been studying here?

202
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:40,497
They have also left.

203
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,065
Their studies are complete.

204
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,333
They are not complete,

205
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,935
you must call them back.

206
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:46,770
They're to return immediately,

207
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,307
otherwise you will face the consequences.

208
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:54,010
(swords clank)

209
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:56,413
God's name be praised.

210
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,682
And what consequences are these,

211
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,216
could you explain?

212
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:02,852
Well, it's really quite simple.

213
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:05,322
Unless you call back the 10 disciples,

214
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,958
we shall be forced to destroy Shao-Lin.

215
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,460
Well you tell your commander

216
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,764
I refuse, I'd rather die than surrender.

217
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,234
God's name be praised.

218
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,712
(dramatic orchestral music)

219
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,355
Master, come on, let's go.

220
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:39,190
Right.

221
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:47,898
(logs clanking)
(dramatic music)

222
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,467
My friend,

223
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,368
are you trying to stop us from passing?

224
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:55,672
But gentlemen,

225
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:56,773
don't you know that all roads lead

226
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:58,274
to the same place?

227
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,909
And which place is that?

228
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,344
Why, to hell.

229
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:03,013
To hell?

230
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:04,147
Well, you must be-

231
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,883
- Yes, I'm your friend.

232
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,121
(gentle strumming orchestral music)

233
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:12,622
And if you don't want to go to hell,

234
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:13,873
you'd better go this way.

235
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:15,725
Stan-You.

236
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,125
Thanks for the directions.

237
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:18,978
Come on, we'll take this other path.

238
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:35,378
(dramatic music)

239
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,481
(grunts)

240
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,053
(yells)

241
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,587
This is a hard pathway.

242
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,289
I remember when he brought me to Shao-Lin,

243
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,524
two years ago now,

244
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,826
but I don't think we passed this way.

245
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:52,862
I want to get you to Whitestone town safely.

246
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,597
It doesn't matter how we get there.

247
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:56,099
Come on.

248
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,934
Right.

249
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:01,237
(water rushing)

250
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:04,742
(gentle orchestral music)

251
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:12,082
Some people have all the luck, huh?

252
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,150
How come we're sent out here on guard?

253
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:16,352
They must know that no one's coming this way.

254
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:18,521
Yeah, you're right about that.

255
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,156
Less spies to have everything,

256
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:21,124
they didn't need to send all of us

257
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,659
into the countryside like this.

258
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,527
Yeah, we're being picked on.

259
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,296
We should be back in the city.

260
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,099
(chuckles) You're too damn right.

261
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:36,306
- Hey.
- Huh?

262
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:37,540
It's your turn to carry.

263
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,775
But I've just been carrying it,

264
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:40,243
you've gotta do your part, too.

265
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,444
It's your turn.

266
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,579
It's yours.

267
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,613
Look, I'm finished.

268
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:44,814
I just told you no, didn't I?

269
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:45,649
All right,

270
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,586
I'll just leave it then!

271
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,254
Huh?

272
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,322
Hey, hey!

273
00:18:52,323 --> 00:18:54,758
(gasps)

274
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,193
Help me, I'm being caught!

275
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,194
What's that?

276
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:00,463
(yells)
(water splashing)

277
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:04,135
(dramatic orchestral music)

278
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,838
(grunts)

279
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,240
Ai!

280
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,476
(grunting)

281
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,583
(moans)

282
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:22,185
(yells)

283
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,255
(groans)

284
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:41,038
(dramatic orchestral music)

285
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,875
Master, let's get moving.

286
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:46,810
Right.

287
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,161
[Chi Tong] Wait a minute.

288
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,346
What do you want?

289
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:51,714
Take a new road.

290
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,783
Don't go up the mountain pathway.

291
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:56,386
Nobody lives up there for miles around.

292
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:57,887
It is much better to detour

293
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,589
through Ching Fang Valley.

294
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,291
Tell me, who are you?

295
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,026
Blue Dragon White Tiger,

296
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,028
I'll see you later.

297
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:06,397
Hey!

298
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,166
[Chi Tong] Comrade, I am the 5th pupil,

299
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,100
Chi Tong.

300
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:14,772
(exciting orchestral music)

301
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:20,176
Father, we have returned.

302
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,579
Shao-Hua is there.

303
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,348
Shi-Ying.

304
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,616
Shao-Hua, welcome back.

305
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:27,450
How was the trip?

306
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:28,285
Fine.

307
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,254
Uncle Chang.

308
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:33,656
Shao-Hua, when will the master return?

309
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:36,159
The abbot sent his 10 disciples as an escort,

310
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,861
he'll be here soon.

311
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,529
Therefore, once he arrives,

312
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,097
then we can start our campaign.

313
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,932
Yes, everything waits for him,

314
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,969
then our country will return to the Ming.

315
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,403
[Both] Mmmm.

316
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:51,041
(dramatic orchestral music)

317
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:54,978
Good,

318
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:58,081
we'll give them a nice surprise.

319
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:01,485
(gentle orchestral music)

320
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:05,956
Shao-Hua, what's the matter?

321
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,893
Half a month has passed already.

322
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,628
King Chiu's still not here.

323
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:13,296
I'm worried.

324
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:15,965
Ah, he's well looked after.

325
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:17,967
Remember, he has an escort.

326
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:20,237
I'm sure he's going to get through all right.

327
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,608
What about you?

328
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,077
I've talked with your father,

329
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,413
but he became very angry with me.

330
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,447
What for?

331
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:32,682
Disloyalty,

332
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:35,018
my first duty should be to my country.

333
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:35,985
That's right.

334
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:37,487
But,

335
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:40,189
but you and I get on so well together, I thought-

336
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,524
- If you don't stop this,

337
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,875
I shall get angry with you.

338
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:46,062
Don't forget,

339
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,864
country comes first

340
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:49,966
before any love.

341
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,602
Understand, the Ming is in great danger,

342
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,870
Shi-Ying.

343
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:55,771
Ah, of course, I know all about that.

344
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,608
I don't mean to lecture you like this.

345
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,143
Now is not the time,

346
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,144
there's work to be done.

347
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,646
Oh, I realize, I do understand.

348
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:04,481
[Man] Sir?

349
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:09,085
Sir, master's here.

350
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:10,320
Oh, where is he?

351
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:11,587
[Man] Waiting in the old house.

352
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:12,855
In the old house?

353
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:13,924
Let's go welcome him.

354
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,193
What's he doing at the old house?

355
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,728
We agreed to rendezvous at Whitestone town.

356
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:19,796
Ah, maybe it's a mistake.

357
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,831
How would I know about that?

358
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,266
Well, is he there?

359
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:24,100
Come on.

360
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:31,708
Where is he?

361
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,109
(dramatic orchestral music)

362
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,944
All right.

363
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:39,782
How dare you harbor common criminals.

364
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,085
You're both guilty.

365
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:43,019
I ask you,

366
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,721
where is King Chiu hiding now?

367
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:46,422
You deliberately set up an ambush.

368
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:47,690
You dumb bastard!

369
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:50,259
(sharp thuds)

370
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,961
Shao-Hua, you go first, I can handle them.

371
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,563
Catch him!

372
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:54,897
(grunts)

373
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:57,701
(swords clanging)

374
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:03,474
(groans)

375
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,612
(grunting)

376
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:13,617
You're not gonna get away!

377
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,453
(moans)

378
00:23:17,454 --> 00:23:18,554
Shi, I'm going!

379
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:22,226
(dramatic orchestral music)

380
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:36,205
All right, in there, men.

381
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,043
(swords clanging)

382
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:46,482
Uncle Chang, Uncle Chang.

383
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:48,384
What's the matter?

384
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,852
We've been betrayed.

385
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,288
Ting-Toe sold us out to the Ching, the damn traitor.

386
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,523
We can't stay here anymore.

387
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,158
We'd better get out of here quick.

388
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,325
But we are so near now.

389
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:57,593
All we need is Chiu.

390
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:58,929
We cannot afford to panic.

391
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,332
Ah, how about this?

392
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,001
I will move out to the north,

393
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,804
while you go down south to help bring Chiu.

394
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:08,639
Good.

395
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:20,183
Are you Brigadier Chow of Shin-Woo Ford?

396
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:21,317
Quite right.

397
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:22,820
Now I think it's time you die.

398
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:27,090
(sharp thudding)

399
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,159
(yells)

400
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,678
(grunting)

401
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:49,946
Fire!

402
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,149
(arrows swoosh)

403
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,117
Fire!

404
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,186
(groans)

405
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,556
(laughs)

406
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,831
My friend, what is your name?

407
00:25:08,832 --> 00:25:11,067
Buddha is my mind, I am the body.

408
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:13,803
Oh, Chi-Tong, it's me.

409
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,638
Brother.

410
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,840
I almost didn't recognize you.

411
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:19,842
Brother, strange things are happening.

412
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:21,911
I suspect there is a spy in the temple.

413
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:23,546
I've come to the same conclusion, brother.

414
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:25,081
What are we gonna do?

415
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:27,183
You better return to the temple to tell the abbot.

416
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:29,218
Remember, be on full alert.

417
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:30,720
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

418
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:31,787
May God go with you.

419
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:32,623
Right.

420
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:43,133
(dramatic orchestral music)

421
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,742
Hmm, who's there?

422
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:55,527
If you're a man, come and show yourself.

423
00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:00,249
Why are you hiding from me?

424
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,350
What are you afraid of?

425
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,219
Stand up and fight like men.

426
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,253
(yells)

427
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:07,090
(swords clanging)

428
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,794
(yells)

429
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:15,165
(clanging and swishing)

430
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,468
(laughs)

431
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,742
So you are one of the 10 disciples of Shao-Lin.

432
00:26:26,743 --> 00:26:28,245
You appear to be strong.

433
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:32,648
Too bad you're going to die.

434
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,083
What is your name?

435
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:36,319
(chuckles)

436
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,589
Later, you'll find out.

437
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:41,525
(yells)

438
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:46,230
(chuckles)

439
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,765
(yelling)

440
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,734
(ax swishes)

441
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,903
(clangs)

442
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:58,575
(sharp smacks)
(grunts)

443
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,655
(groaning)

444
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:15,225
(yells)

445
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,000
(groaning)

446
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:31,208
(screaming)

447
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,677
My name is Brigadier Chow.

448
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:35,778
(groaning)

449
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,449
(dramatic orchestral music)

450
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:49,792
Mister, you must stop.

451
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,194
This is the Shao-Lin Temple.

452
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:53,963
Comrades,

453
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,364
it is Chi-Tong.

454
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:56,666
Ah, Chi-Tong.

455
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,700
[Men] Brother!

456
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:59,535
[Chi-Tong] Is the abbot about?

457
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:02,239
How can you be sure?

458
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,620
How do you know there is a spy?

459
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:19,588
If there is no spy here,

460
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:22,925
how did they know where to lie in wait for us?

461
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:24,260
They had information.

462
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:25,095
Oh.

463
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,099
It's bad Abbot.

464
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,300
We need to act now

465
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:33,269
before the spy betrays all of us.

466
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,637
It's strange.

467
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:38,140
Nobody except for the high priests

468
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,476
knew our strategy.

469
00:28:40,477 --> 00:28:43,312
Also, how did the enemy

470
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:45,081
find out so soon?

471
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:46,382
It is puzzling.

472
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:47,833
[Chi-Tong] He used pigeons.

473
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:50,854
[Abbot] Oh!

474
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,860
(dramatic orchestral music)

475
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:10,873
[Man] Teacher.

476
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,708
Huh?

477
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:18,147
Teacher, something awful's happened.

478
00:29:18,148 --> 00:29:20,483
And what are you in such a hurry a for?

479
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:21,984
The Abbot says we have a traitor here.

480
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:23,853
He is searching the whole monastery.

481
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:24,688
Oh.

482
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:29,792
Good, you go back first.

483
00:29:29,793 --> 00:29:30,726
Yes.

484
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,794
(groans)

485
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:35,465
(dramatic orchestral music)

486
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:19,757
[Abbot] Where did you say you found him?

487
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:23,078
Well, Abbot, I found him down by the well,

488
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,580
and there's a dovecote there, too.

489
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:25,649
A dovecote?

490
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,254
(dramatic sinister orchestral music)

491
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,629
Also, Abbot, he was killed instantly

492
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,499
by a special kind of Chinese karate.

493
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:44,366
Oh?

494
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:51,807
Karate?

495
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:53,643
No, it couldn't be.

496
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,413
Isn't it true

497
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,548
that only the elders have learned Chinese karate?

498
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:00,699
Is one of them the spy?

499
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,953
This is a serious matter.

500
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:05,822
Don't jump to any conclusions.

501
00:31:07,257 --> 00:31:09,658
We must make sure first of all

502
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,661
we have made no mistakes

503
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:14,830
before we name the spy.

504
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,499
We have work to do.

505
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,003
(exciting dramatic music)

506
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:53,969
Chi-Yung, I'm so tired.

507
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,304
I can't move another yard.

508
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:58,107
Come on, it's not safe to take a rest yet.

509
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:00,543
But I must take a rest. I
really can't go any further.

510
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,444
Surely we're safe.

511
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:03,179
Yes.

512
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:05,949
All right, you can rest.

513
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:16,026
(laughter echoes)

514
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,769
Oh, Chi-Yung, oh, Chi-Yung.

515
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,904
Uh-uh.

516
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:38,547
(yells)
(sharp thudding)

517
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:40,149
What are you doing here?

518
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,485
(laughs) I am leader of the guard,

519
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:44,321
Lan-Ching Yiu.

520
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,791
Huh, you're no better than a dog following us about.

521
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:53,096
(yells)
(grunting)

522
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:06,842
(chuckles) So, you think you're qualified

523
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:09,078
as a disciple of Shao-Lin?

524
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,614
Now, let's see how good you are.

525
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,316
(chuckles)

526
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:15,150
[Chiu] Chi-Yung.

527
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:16,085
Huh?

528
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:17,987
Chi-Yung, Chi-Yung, help!

529
00:33:17,988 --> 00:33:22,559
(grunting)
(thudding)

530
00:33:40,777 --> 00:33:42,111
(groans)

531
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:46,415
(dramatic orchestral music)
Chi-Yung, help!

532
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,249
Let me go!

533
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,084
Chi-Yung!

534
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:54,156
Chi-Yung, help me!

535
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,492
[Man] Out of the way!

536
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,127
Chi-Yung, make them let me go!

537
00:33:58,128 --> 00:33:58,961
Here you go!

538
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:00,996
(clanging)

539
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,667
(sword swishes)

540
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:08,471
(grunting)

541
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:22,117
Comrade,

542
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,719
Comrade!

543
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,722
(yells)

544
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:28,891
Comrade, where is he?

545
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:33,362
They took him away.

546
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,596
I'll get him.

547
00:34:34,597 --> 00:34:36,599
(yells)

548
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:39,836
You get away.

549
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:42,704
(sword swishes)

550
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,773
Oh, are you from Shao-Lin, too?

551
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:46,141
That's right.

552
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:46,975
Hee-yah.

553
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:50,245
(grunts)

554
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:55,350
(sword swishes)

555
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,393
(groans)

556
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:41,297
(groans)

557
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,169
(grunting)

558
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,014
(groans)

559
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:02,085
Mr. Chiu!

560
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:03,987
Mister!

561
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:08,056
Mr. Chiu.

562
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:09,691
Thank you for saving my life.

563
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:11,627
God's name be praised.

564
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,762
Mister, let's go and find my other comrade.

565
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:16,031
Excuse me, who is your other comrade?

566
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:17,533
His name is Chi-Yung.

567
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:18,768
Ah, Chi-Yung!

568
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:20,569
Master Chiu.

569
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,404
Chi-Yung!

570
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,542
Oh, friend.

571
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:28,243
Master Chiu, are you all
right? Brother, thank you.

572
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:29,611
Are you frightened?

573
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:30,813
No, this man, he saved my life.

574
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,415
Oh, so you've come along as well?

575
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,617
He was in trouble, so I helped him.

576
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:36,985
Then let us proceed together.

577
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,720
No, you go on ahead.

578
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:39,556
See you later.

579
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:42,191
Good, we'll see you soon.

580
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:45,862
(dramatic orchestral music)

581
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,446
Commander, a white haired fisherman

582
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,748
is also working for Shao-Lin.

583
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:08,617
Oh, fisherman?

584
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:11,053
In my opinion, he is most dangerous.

585
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:12,187
He fights like no man

586
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,556
I've ever seen before.

587
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:16,325
Commander, he sounds to me like

588
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:17,826
one of the disciples.

589
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:21,430
Even if he isn't, and we kill an innocent man,

590
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:23,499
he mustn't escape from us.

591
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,235
Father,

592
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:27,437
let me take care of him.

593
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,610
(dramatic orchestral music)

594
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:05,274
(darts whizzing)

595
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:07,976
(yells)

596
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:09,177
(chuckles)

597
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:12,147
You have been wounded by a poisonous dart.

598
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:13,782
In a few minutes,

599
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:15,617
you are going to die.

600
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:17,185
I don't even know you.

601
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:19,021
Why did you want to take my life?

602
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:21,089
(gasping)

603
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,357
What have I done to you?

604
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:23,626
I'm not your enemy.

605
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,296
(chuckles) Everyone who comes

606
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:28,498
from Shao-Lin Monastery

607
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,700
is our enemy.

608
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,870
(gasping)

609
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,207
(groaning)

610
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:45,348
(yells)
(dramatic orchestral music)

611
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,352
(groaning)

612
00:38:55,658 --> 00:38:58,394
(all chattering)

613
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,100
(dramatic orchestral music)

614
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:46,876
It's here.

615
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:50,145
Let's get inside.

616
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:54,216
[Chi-Yung] Hold it.

617
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,050
Gentlemen.

618
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:56,201
Waiter, some customers!

619
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:57,887
Coming!

620
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,790
Do you want a meal or a room for the night?

621
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,691
A room.

622
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,742
[Waiter] All right.

623
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:09,198
[Man] Hey, waiter, over here, I want some tea.

624
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,035
Follow me.

625
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,471
Come on, let's go upstairs.

626
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,443
(customers chattering)

627
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:27,183
This way.

628
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:31,954
(dramatic orchestral music)

629
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:43,298
Hey.

630
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,067
Please.

631
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:49,037
Hey.

632
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,640
Ah, hey, hey!

633
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,843
(grunting)

634
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,848
(groans)

635
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:00,682
Hello.

636
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:07,989
Waiter.

637
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,759
(dramatic orchestral music)

638
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,927
Please, go inside, mister.

639
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,295
Do you have any rooms here?

640
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:14,397
Oh, yes, sure, sure.

641
00:41:16,899 --> 00:41:18,401
Ah, mister, please get inside.

642
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,272
Now, sir,

643
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,407
what can I get you to drink first?

644
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:26,541
[Man In Brown] Jasmine tea.

645
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,510
[Waiter] A Chinese tea!

646
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:30,379
[Man] A Chinese tea coming up!

647
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:35,118
(chuckles)

648
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,591
(dramatic orchestral music)

649
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,594
Mr. Chow.

650
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:47,596
Mr. Chow, an official visit?

651
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:51,234
(dramatic orchestral music)

652
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:02,411
Hold it!

653
00:42:05,615 --> 00:42:06,449
Come down.

654
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:10,652
Mister, the leader of the guard,

655
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,687
Brigadier Chow.

656
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:38,146
What is your line of work?

657
00:42:38,147 --> 00:42:39,114
Businessman.

658
00:42:39,115 --> 00:42:40,649
And where do you come from?

659
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,850
From the south.

660
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,419
Oh, from the south.

661
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,656
(chuckles)

662
00:42:47,957 --> 00:42:50,058
(yells)

663
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,794
(dramatic orchestral music)

664
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:54,764
(yells)

665
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,100
(grunting)

666
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:16,352
(glass shatters)

667
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,790
(yelling)

668
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,338
(grunting)

669
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:45,548
(groans)

670
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,209
(grunting)

671
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,551
Take Master Chiu to the south.

672
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:25,120
I'll follow later.

673
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,588
Right.

674
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:28,858
(grunting)

675
00:44:33,062 --> 00:44:37,500
(dramatic exciting orchestral music)

676
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:55,217
This way.

677
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:02,258
Quickly!

678
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:06,095
Look!

679
00:45:12,134 --> 00:45:13,335
Master.

680
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,270
Soldiers.

681
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:17,406
Come on!

682
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:20,976
(yelling)

683
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,248
More soldiers, come on!

684
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:28,084
Hurry.

685
00:45:34,423 --> 00:45:38,761
(intense dramatic orchestral music)

686
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:43,132
[Man In Red] There they are right below!

687
00:45:46,235 --> 00:45:48,403
It's bad, the army's got us surrounded.

688
00:45:48,404 --> 00:45:50,672
- What do we do?
- Once they catch up with us,

689
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:52,674
it'll be hard to get away.

690
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:54,743
Let me set up a kind of diversion.

691
00:45:54,744 --> 00:45:57,212
You take Master Chiu away to the north,

692
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,513
then turn southwards.

693
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:00,315
We'll meet up at the Yom-Ting Gate.

694
00:46:00,316 --> 00:46:01,883
At dusk in three days time, I'll be there,

695
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,184
so keep waiting.

696
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:05,653
Good, I won't leave until you come.

697
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:06,955
See you later.

698
00:46:06,956 --> 00:46:07,789
Good bye.

699
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:08,623
Bye.

700
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:09,891
All right, come on.

701
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:14,196
(exciting dramatic orchestral music)

702
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:18,366
[Man] Come on, right here.

703
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,369
Don't let them get away!

704
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:31,380
Come on.

705
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,954
Quickly!

706
00:46:49,665 --> 00:46:50,833
Come on, move!

707
00:47:02,578 --> 00:47:03,745
[Man] He went that way!

708
00:47:03,746 --> 00:47:04,914
[Man] Right.

709
00:47:16,725 --> 00:47:21,130
(exciting dramatic orchestral music)

710
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:25,333
Boatman, boatman,

711
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:26,334
please help us.

712
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:27,902
Take us across the river.

713
00:47:27,903 --> 00:47:29,003
What's all the hurry?

714
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:30,138
Oh, but, we're being chased

715
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,539
by a Ching Army patrol.

716
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,475
Huh, soldiers?

717
00:47:36,212 --> 00:47:37,479
Okay, get in.

718
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,851
(dramatic exciting orchestral music)

719
00:47:54,864 --> 00:47:55,697
There they are!

720
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:56,532
Come on!

721
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,069
[Man] Hey, boatman!

722
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,037
[Man] Hey, boatman, stop!

723
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:04,506
Get back here!

724
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,141
[Man] Boatman, come back!

725
00:48:07,142 --> 00:48:08,977
[Man In Red] Boatman, stop!

726
00:48:08,978 --> 00:48:11,313
Boatman, hey, come back here!

727
00:48:13,115 --> 00:48:15,283
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back!

728
00:48:15,284 --> 00:48:17,785
Come back!

729
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:18,887
[Man] Come back here!

730
00:48:18,888 --> 00:48:20,255
[Man] Boatman!

731
00:48:20,256 --> 00:48:21,256
[Man] Come back here!

732
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:22,624
[Man] Boatman!

733
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:24,058
[Man] Come back!

734
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:26,562
(all yelling)

735
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:33,668
[Man] You, bring it back over here!

736
00:48:33,669 --> 00:48:34,503
Quickly!

737
00:48:35,437 --> 00:48:36,838
Get back over here!

738
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,107
Boatman, how much will it cost?

739
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:40,275
(all shouting)

740
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:41,509
A dollar.

741
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,344
Huh?

742
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:47,116
(gentle orchestral music)

743
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,453
It doesn't cost you anything.

744
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:54,490
Good.

745
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:57,825
Thank you.

746
00:48:57,826 --> 00:48:59,894
Boatman, boatman!

747
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,931
Come back over here!

748
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:05,533
[Man] Hey, boatman, bring it back over here!

749
00:49:05,534 --> 00:49:08,903
(all shouting)

750
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,039
You son of a bitch!

751
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,307
Come away!

752
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:16,412
(exciting dramatic orchestral music)

753
00:49:25,654 --> 00:49:27,256
Out of my way, dog!

754
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:36,665
Boatman!

755
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:44,073
Boatman!

756
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,011
Boatman, I left home to wander about!

757
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:52,080
To wander about?

758
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:52,982
I'm coming!

759
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:16,404
Hold it.

760
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:17,839
Huh?

761
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,109
(clanging)

762
00:50:21,276 --> 00:50:26,281
(yells)
(dramatic orchestral music)

763
00:50:34,256 --> 00:50:39,261
(yelling)
(swords clang and swish)

764
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:03,918
(groans)

765
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,522
(sword clangs)

766
00:51:11,593 --> 00:51:16,598
(grunting)
(swords swishing)

767
00:51:26,942 --> 00:51:30,612
(dramatic orchestral music)

768
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:47,429
Master, you don't need to kill him.

769
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:55,037
(sword clangs)
(grunting)

770
00:52:14,556 --> 00:52:16,625
(groans)

771
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,596
(grunting)

772
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:31,372
(swords clanging)
gru

773
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:33,642
(grunting)

774
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:48,490
(yells)

775
00:53:00,102 --> 00:53:02,337
(groaning)

776
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,884
(grunting)

777
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,655
(swords clanging)

778
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,495
(yells)

779
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:31,733
(groaning)

780
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:42,411
(grunting)

781
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,687
(yelling)

782
00:53:54,756 --> 00:53:57,025
(grunting)

783
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:04,967
(grunting)

784
00:54:17,913 --> 00:54:20,148
(grunting)

785
00:54:26,655 --> 00:54:29,658
(breathing heavily)

786
00:54:31,593 --> 00:54:33,862
(grunting)

787
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:49,478
(grunting)

788
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:01,589
[Man] The Commander in Chief!

789
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,260
(majestic orchestral music)

790
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,712
[Man] Master.

791
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:27,582
Father.

792
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,285
Master, we have tried to capture the traitor,

793
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,587
but each time the Shao-Lin monks interfered.

794
00:55:33,588 --> 00:55:34,423
So we-

795
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:36,792
- So you ran back home.

796
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:49,870
Commander, the 10 disciples

797
00:55:49,871 --> 00:55:51,205
broke through our blockade

798
00:55:51,206 --> 00:55:52,707
and wounded our men.

799
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:53,874
I think we should send out

800
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:56,744
an entire army after them.

801
00:55:56,745 --> 00:55:58,646
You should have realized

802
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,915
the 10 disciples are the most superior

803
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:03,384
fighting monks in Shao-Lin,

804
00:56:03,385 --> 00:56:05,786
especially the man called Chi-Yung.

805
00:56:05,787 --> 00:56:09,323
His kung fu's excellent, most talented.

806
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,093
(chuckles) Old man,

807
00:56:12,227 --> 00:56:13,361
how many days have you been here?

808
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:15,429
Oh, 10 days now.

809
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,532
Don't you think they'll be missing you at Shao-Lin?

810
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:19,734
Mmm.

811
00:56:19,735 --> 00:56:21,602
What do yo intend to do about it?

812
00:56:21,603 --> 00:56:22,536
I see,

813
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:24,238
it's time for action.

814
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:25,406
You kill Chi-Yung,

815
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:27,242
and bring Chiu to me.

816
00:56:29,244 --> 00:56:30,478
If you do that,

817
00:56:30,479 --> 00:56:32,446
I'll appoint you abbot of Shao-Lin.

818
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:33,547
Oh.

819
00:56:33,548 --> 00:56:35,783
Old man, do you agree?

820
00:56:35,784 --> 00:56:36,717
I do.

821
00:56:36,718 --> 00:56:38,352
I would like being the abbot.

822
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,653
It's a deal then.

823
00:56:39,654 --> 00:56:41,422
Commander, the traitor Chiu

824
00:56:41,423 --> 00:56:42,857
has escaped yet again.

825
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,058
He's heading south.

826
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:46,560
Our soldiers were unable to capture him.

827
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:47,895
Perhaps the old man

828
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:49,697
will be able to give us some help.

829
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:50,532
Mmmm.

830
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,901
Old man, Chi-Yung does not know

831
00:56:53,902 --> 00:56:55,836
that you betrayed Shao-Lin.

832
00:56:55,837 --> 00:56:58,572
Only you can do it, you must help us now.

833
00:56:58,573 --> 00:57:02,010
(exciting dramatic music)

834
00:57:17,492 --> 00:57:20,996
(gentle orchestral music)

835
00:57:46,154 --> 00:57:47,822
(dramatic orchestral music)

836
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:48,657
Teacher!

837
00:57:54,162 --> 00:57:55,296
Good to see you.

838
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:56,697
Good day.

839
00:57:56,698 --> 00:57:57,898
How come you're here?

840
00:57:57,899 --> 00:58:00,134
Right now, I have come here for King Chiu.

841
00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:01,102
For me?

842
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,270
You follow me.

843
00:58:03,205 --> 00:58:04,105
A priest!

844
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,039
Teacher.

845
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,240
I only want him.

846
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:08,109
Not you, get out!

847
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,310
What?

848
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,544
Teacher, why are you acting like this?

849
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:12,713
Orders of the Ching commander.

850
00:58:12,714 --> 00:58:14,381
I must arrest him.

851
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:15,649
[Chiu] What?

852
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,084
Teacher, you've joined the Ching.

853
00:58:17,085 --> 00:58:19,920
Teacher, I was given strict orders

854
00:58:19,921 --> 00:58:21,589
to protect King Chiu.

855
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,457
With my own life, if need be.

856
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,992
I cannot allow you to take him.

857
00:58:24,993 --> 00:58:27,528
You think that I will not kill you?

858
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:29,463
- (yells)
- Priest!

859
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,932
You must not kill him.

860
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:35,469
Well, all right, I'll go with you.

861
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,704
No!

862
00:58:36,705 --> 00:58:39,640
Chi-Yung, thank you for your protection.

863
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,742
You suffered much,

864
00:58:41,943 --> 00:58:43,345
but I don't want you to die.

865
00:58:44,946 --> 00:58:48,349
If destiny ordains the Ming are no more,

866
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,252
so be it, I have done all I could.

867
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:55,122
Now, Priest,

868
00:58:55,123 --> 00:58:56,958
I ask you to release Chi-Yung.

869
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,960
I'll come with you to the Ching commander.

870
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:02,963
Master, you are our anointed king.

871
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:04,932
Your subjects need you with them.

872
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:06,400
We will save you.

873
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:07,935
It's our duty, after all,

874
00:59:07,936 --> 00:59:09,571
even to sacrifice our life.

875
00:59:10,705 --> 00:59:11,539
(dramatic music)

876
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,542
God's name be praised.

877
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:18,412
Elder.

878
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:21,049
You've come at the right time.

879
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:23,717
Teacher.

880
00:59:23,718 --> 00:59:24,953
[Chiu] Abbot.

881
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:29,423
Elder, let's go back to the temple.

882
00:59:29,424 --> 00:59:32,726
Back to the temple to be punished?

883
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:34,262
I am not a common criminal.

884
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,031
Yang-Kho,

885
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,466
you cannot take me back.

886
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,537
Only in one's mind.

887
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,439
I know all that nonsense.

888
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,576
Don't tell me what is written.

889
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,912
(sighs)

890
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,014
I know, too,

891
00:59:54,015 --> 00:59:55,684
what you really desire,

892
00:59:57,018 --> 00:59:58,852
but it is not worth the price

893
00:59:58,853 --> 01:00:00,654
you're prepared to pay.

894
01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:03,524
Please, consider your soul.

895
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:04,359
Shut up!

896
01:00:06,461 --> 01:00:08,596
I came to Shao-Lin as a child.

897
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:10,864
I learned Buddhist sutras everyday

898
01:00:10,865 --> 01:00:12,666
and practiced kung fu.

899
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,168
It has been a hard life,

900
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:17,238
and what have I got from it in return?

901
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,740
I wanted to become the abbot of Shao-Lin,

902
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,675
but our master was prejudiced.

903
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:23,077
Do you think you are better than me?

904
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,078
Do you?

905
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,079
Answer me!

906
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,513
(sighing)

907
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:29,084
Elder, you do everything better.

908
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,587
(dramatic orchestral music)

909
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,822
You are quite right.

910
01:00:34,823 --> 01:00:36,124
You should be the abbot.

911
01:00:41,796 --> 01:00:44,466
Shao-Lin will become a strong foundation

912
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,534
under your leadership.

913
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:51,439
(sentimental orchestral music)

914
01:01:07,188 --> 01:01:08,556
God's name be praised.

915
01:01:12,927 --> 01:01:15,195
Hold on to the holy scepter.

916
01:01:15,196 --> 01:01:18,365
Now you are the abbot of Shao-Lin.

917
01:01:18,366 --> 01:01:20,602
(chuckles)

918
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,972
I am the abbot,

919
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,641
at last I am the abbot of Shao-Lin.

920
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,744
(laughs)

921
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:52,934
(dramatic orchestral music)

922
01:01:52,935 --> 01:01:53,769
Elder!

923
01:01:54,569 --> 01:01:56,304
(groaning)

924
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:57,138
Elder.

925
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,542
Teacher, Teacher.

926
01:02:04,913 --> 01:02:06,613
I deserve it.

927
01:02:06,614 --> 01:02:07,948
It's what I wanted.

928
01:02:07,949 --> 01:02:08,783
Elder.

929
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:14,723
Good and evil exist,

930
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,826
only in one's own mind.

931
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:23,130
Who should realize this truth

932
01:02:23,131 --> 01:02:26,433
will find peace

933
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:27,435
at last.

934
01:02:34,175 --> 01:02:35,943
(gasping)

935
01:02:35,944 --> 01:02:37,177
[Both] Teacher!

936
01:02:37,178 --> 01:02:38,278
Elder!

937
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:40,615
- Elder!
- [Chi-Yung] Teacher!

938
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,086
God's name be praised.

939
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,050
Why hasn't Chiu come yet?

940
01:03:17,051 --> 01:03:19,854
He should be here, it's getting late.

941
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,024
Come on.

942
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:29,397
(moaning)

943
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:32,534
Quickly.

944
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,038
Oh, brother, it's you.

945
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:38,872
Brother.

946
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:40,041
You've all arrived?

947
01:03:41,509 --> 01:03:42,810
Where's Shao-Hua?

948
01:03:42,811 --> 01:03:45,345
She went back first to the headquarters.

949
01:03:45,346 --> 01:03:46,547
Oh?

950
01:03:46,548 --> 01:03:48,048
Oh, Chi-Yung, we'd better be going.

951
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:51,051
No, there are too many soldiers about.

952
01:03:51,052 --> 01:03:54,722
(dramatic orchestral music)

953
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,673
Uncle Chang?

954
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:50,845
Uncle Chang?

955
01:04:54,449 --> 01:04:55,450
Uncle Chang?

956
01:04:56,417 --> 01:05:00,054
(dramatic orchestral music)

957
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,261
Who are you?

958
01:05:07,262 --> 01:05:09,062
I am the hunter home from the hill.

959
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,767
Where is Uncle Chang?

960
01:05:13,768 --> 01:05:15,736
Ha.

961
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:17,437
He's gone where he won't come back.

962
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:18,639
And who exactly are you?

963
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,008
The official guard of the Ching Commander,

964
01:05:21,009 --> 01:05:23,578
and this is the son of the commander in chief,

965
01:05:24,612 --> 01:05:25,746
Lu-Shao-Wan.

966
01:05:25,747 --> 01:05:28,015
If you hand the traitor Chiu over to us,

967
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:30,317
then we will spare both your lives.

968
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:31,451
I will never do it!

969
01:05:31,452 --> 01:05:34,289
(swords clanging)

970
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:39,227
(grunting)

971
01:05:59,047 --> 01:06:01,515
(groans)

972
01:06:01,516 --> 01:06:02,816
(swords clanging)

973
01:06:02,817 --> 01:06:05,086
(grunting)

974
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,793
(groans)

975
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:16,798
(swords clanking and swooshing)

976
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:36,618
(swords clanking)
(grunting)

977
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:49,831
(groans)

978
01:06:51,165 --> 01:06:54,002
(swords clanking)

979
01:07:07,715 --> 01:07:09,984
(grunting)

980
01:07:13,588 --> 01:07:17,258
(dramatic orchestral music)

981
01:07:36,577 --> 01:07:38,813
(grunting)

982
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:47,088
Halt!

983
01:07:49,257 --> 01:07:51,191
Surround the place!

984
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,361
(yelling)

985
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,137
(yells)

986
01:08:04,138 --> 01:08:09,143
(grunting)
(swishing and thudding)

987
01:08:18,086 --> 01:08:20,353
(grunting)

988
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:39,773
[Man] On the left,

989
01:08:39,774 --> 01:08:41,442
you search that way.

990
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,712
Brother, Mistress Lu is inside.

991
01:08:45,713 --> 01:08:46,914
We'd better help her.

992
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:51,817
Brother, Mistress Lu is in danger.

993
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:53,754
We cannot stand here doing nothing.

994
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,455
Certainly we're gonna do something,

995
01:08:56,456 --> 01:08:59,493
but first we must make sure our effort's not in vain.

996
01:08:59,494 --> 01:09:02,161
When we strike, we must make it count.

997
01:09:02,162 --> 01:09:03,696
I agree with you.

998
01:09:03,697 --> 01:09:06,266
Our duty is to protect Chiu at all costs.

999
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,401
Of course, we'll have to leave her,

1000
01:09:08,402 --> 01:09:09,436
but we will come back.

1001
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,771
We can't help her.

1002
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:12,506
Right now, we'd better make sure

1003
01:09:12,507 --> 01:09:13,673
that Chiu is perfectly safe.

1004
01:09:13,674 --> 01:09:15,107
We left him outside the gates.

1005
01:09:15,108 --> 01:09:16,843
He could be in danger.

1006
01:09:16,844 --> 01:09:17,710
But-

1007
01:09:17,711 --> 01:09:19,477
- We must protect him.

1008
01:09:19,478 --> 01:09:20,630
We will come back soon.

1009
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:22,750
Damn!

1010
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,088
[Man] Make ready, quickly over there!

1011
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,429
(dramatic orchestral music)

1012
01:09:50,778 --> 01:09:51,612
What?

1013
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:53,581
How come he's alive?

1014
01:09:54,749 --> 01:09:56,216
Who is he?

1015
01:09:56,217 --> 01:09:57,618
The captain of the guards,

1016
01:09:58,686 --> 01:09:59,520
Lan-Ching Yiu.

1017
01:10:00,555 --> 01:10:01,388
Comrade,

1018
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:04,825
when I was passing through the forests

1019
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,127
I came across our brother.

1020
01:10:07,128 --> 01:10:07,961
He was-

1021
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,062
- Brother, how was he?

1022
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:11,965
He was dead.

1023
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:13,133
Ah!

1024
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:16,637
(somber orchestral music)

1025
01:10:26,113 --> 01:10:27,547
Brother, you two

1026
01:10:27,548 --> 01:10:29,883
go and look after Chiu at the city gates.

1027
01:10:29,884 --> 01:10:32,719
At daybreak, we will all meet again at Stone Hill.

1028
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,955
[Both] Right.

1029
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:38,693
(dramatic orchestral music)

1030
01:10:41,329 --> 01:10:42,296
After him!

1031
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,869
(gasping)

1032
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,105
(groaning)

1033
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:58,112
(grunting)

1034
01:11:08,856 --> 01:11:10,390
Father.

1035
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,225
(gasping)

1036
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,361
My son, my son!

1037
01:11:14,362 --> 01:11:15,929
My son!

1038
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:20,268
(intense dramatic orchestral music)

1039
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,721
(yells)

1040
01:11:43,491 --> 01:11:45,726
(grunting)

1041
01:11:49,363 --> 01:11:51,599
(swishing)

1042
01:11:59,473 --> 01:12:01,642
(shouting)

1043
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:06,380
(dramatic orchestral music)

1044
01:12:17,358 --> 01:12:19,360
(sighs)

1045
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:25,432
(intense dramatic orchestral music)

1046
01:12:25,433 --> 01:12:28,269
(hooves thudding)

1047
01:13:00,968 --> 01:13:02,836
(yells)

1048
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,971
(grunting)

1049
01:13:04,972 --> 01:13:08,575
(scratching)
(groans)

1050
01:13:08,576 --> 01:13:10,844
Today I'll make you pay for my brother's life.

1051
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,246
(shouts)

1052
01:13:13,247 --> 01:13:15,516
(grunting)

1053
01:13:23,824 --> 01:13:26,059
(yells)

1054
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,327
(dramatic orchestral music)

1055
01:13:27,328 --> 01:13:29,597
(groaning)

1056
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:45,112
(gasping)

1057
01:13:47,114 --> 01:13:48,848
Huh, what?

1058
01:13:48,849 --> 01:13:50,250
I am Shao-Lin, too,

1059
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,451
the 8th disciple.

1060
01:13:51,452 --> 01:13:53,820
My name's Chi-Tur, how are you?

1061
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:56,389
Please excuse me for being so reckless.

1062
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,592
Ah, pleased to meet you.

1063
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:05,231
All of you Shao-Lin

1064
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,167
have been so kind to me.

1065
01:14:07,168 --> 01:14:09,803
I don't know how can I ever repay you.

1066
01:14:09,804 --> 01:14:12,105
God's name be praised.

1067
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:13,473
What we do is only our duty

1068
01:14:13,474 --> 01:14:15,341
out of our love for our country.

1069
01:14:15,342 --> 01:14:17,444
Please, think nothing of it.

1070
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:19,012
You must go back at once,

1071
01:14:19,013 --> 01:14:20,580
otherwise they'll miss you.

1072
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,682
You must not move away from this place.

1073
01:14:22,683 --> 01:14:24,918
I go now to contact my comrades.

1074
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,052
Be on your guard.

1075
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:26,887
Good bye.

1076
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:34,995
(dramatic orchestral music)

1077
01:15:11,365 --> 01:15:14,869
(somber orchestral music)

1078
01:15:31,385 --> 01:15:34,320
My son,

1079
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:39,326
my son.

1080
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,827
[Man] Father, Father, Father!

1081
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:51,565
My son!

1082
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:55,035
[Man] Father!

1083
01:16:58,872 --> 01:16:59,907
Father!

1084
01:17:04,545 --> 01:17:07,247
My son, my son!

1085
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,283
My son!

1086
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:20,194
(sighs)

1087
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:44,051
(sighing)

1088
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:50,757
(footsteps thudding)

1089
01:18:02,569 --> 01:18:05,371
Commander, the traitor Chiu is here.

1090
01:18:05,372 --> 01:18:09,043
(dramatic orchestral music)

1091
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,236
So I have you in my hands at long last.

1092
01:18:37,237 --> 01:18:38,072
Hmm.

1093
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,440
Sit down.

1094
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:41,341
Sir!

1095
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,242
I don't want to.

1096
01:18:45,412 --> 01:18:46,579
[Chin-Hoo] What's that?

1097
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,714
You dare to disobey the commander?

1098
01:18:47,715 --> 01:18:49,582
[Commander] Chin-Hoo!

1099
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:51,018
Here, yes, sir.

1100
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,387
King Chiu Chin.

1101
01:18:54,388 --> 01:18:55,956
You are the King Chiu Chin?

1102
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,029
Aren't you?

1103
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:06,366
What was your territory

1104
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,302
now all belongs to me, it's mine.

1105
01:19:09,503 --> 01:19:12,405
You should learn to swim with the tide

1106
01:19:12,406 --> 01:19:13,272
or drown.

1107
01:19:13,273 --> 01:19:14,274
I haven't lost.

1108
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:17,043
There is still hope.

1109
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,845
And if you die,

1110
01:19:18,846 --> 01:19:20,580
is there still hope then?

1111
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:22,649
(laughs)

1112
01:19:24,318 --> 01:19:27,453
If I die, my soul goes,

1113
01:19:27,454 --> 01:19:28,956
and the name of King Chiu Chin

1114
01:19:30,023 --> 01:19:31,125
becomes history.

1115
01:19:32,192 --> 01:19:34,427
Oh, you are history all right,

1116
01:19:34,428 --> 01:19:37,530
Chiu Chin, but I'm not gonna kill you yet.

1117
01:19:37,531 --> 01:19:38,364
Ah?

1118
01:19:39,967 --> 01:19:42,268
You want to humble me?

1119
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:44,004
Is that what you intend?

1120
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:48,542
You can still serve a useful purpose.

1121
01:19:50,711 --> 01:19:52,846
I want you to be the bait.

1122
01:19:53,881 --> 01:19:55,883
I want to crush the Ming,

1123
01:19:57,017 --> 01:19:58,986
especially the 10 disciples.

1124
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:05,826
(exciting dramatic orchestral music)

1125
01:20:25,245 --> 01:20:26,079
Hold it.

1126
01:20:27,714 --> 01:20:28,681
Comrade.

1127
01:20:28,682 --> 01:20:29,883
Huh, Chi-Tur!

1128
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:32,452
Comrade, it's too bad,

1129
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,253
but Chiu Chin has vanished.

1130
01:20:34,254 --> 01:20:35,254
What?

1131
01:20:35,255 --> 01:20:36,689
Disappeared?

1132
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:37,857
How did it happen?

1133
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:39,158
It is all my fault.

1134
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:41,227
I saw him wandering alone in the street.

1135
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:42,795
I thought the soldiers would see him,

1136
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:43,797
so I...

1137
01:20:44,832 --> 01:20:45,665
Damn it!

1138
01:20:46,533 --> 01:20:47,783
What are we gonna do now?

1139
01:20:48,936 --> 01:20:50,369
Where's Chi-Ming and Chi-Chin?

1140
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,203
I don't know.

1141
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,474
Come on.

1142
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:58,244
(exciting dramatic orchestral music)

1143
01:20:58,245 --> 01:20:59,078
This way.

1144
01:21:07,754 --> 01:21:10,056
[Man] Oh, brother!

1145
01:21:10,057 --> 01:21:10,891
Hi.

1146
01:21:12,593 --> 01:21:13,426
Brother!

1147
01:21:13,427 --> 01:21:14,360
Brother.

1148
01:21:14,361 --> 01:21:15,194
We could not find Chiu-Chin

1149
01:21:15,195 --> 01:21:16,529
at all at the city gate.

1150
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:18,164
He's disappeared.

1151
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:18,998
I know it.

1152
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,400
Chi-Tur told me already.

1153
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:22,802
But what about Mistress Lu?

1154
01:21:22,803 --> 01:21:24,871
Kung-Chin-Hui has already left.

1155
01:21:24,872 --> 01:21:28,274
I'm afraid that she is dead.

1156
01:21:28,275 --> 01:21:29,942
Kung-Chin-Hui.

1157
01:21:29,943 --> 01:21:30,776
Who is he?

1158
01:21:30,777 --> 01:21:32,044
I don't know him.

1159
01:21:32,045 --> 01:21:33,312
He's the commander of Tong-Ping County.

1160
01:21:33,313 --> 01:21:35,414
He's a very tough nut, hard to crack.

1161
01:21:35,415 --> 01:21:36,916
Oh?

1162
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:38,285
In the present situation,

1163
01:21:39,253 --> 01:21:41,053
and with Chiu disappeared,

1164
01:21:41,054 --> 01:21:42,588
I guess Kung is our only lead.

1165
01:21:42,589 --> 01:21:45,591
All right, let's go and find him, we'll ask him.

1166
01:21:45,592 --> 01:21:47,693
Good, I'll bring you to him.

1167
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:51,331
(dramatic orchestral music)

1168
01:21:57,671 --> 01:22:01,141
(intense orchestral music)

1169
01:22:04,144 --> 01:22:05,511
Who is it?

1170
01:22:05,512 --> 01:22:07,747
Brother, he's the commander of Tong-Ping County,

1171
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:08,581
Kung-Chin-Hui.

1172
01:22:08,582 --> 01:22:09,782
You're right,

1173
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:12,051
and you're not gonna leave this place alive,

1174
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,252
god damn you!

1175
01:22:13,253 --> 01:22:14,420
You will release King Chiu immediately.

1176
01:22:14,421 --> 01:22:16,255
You are nothing.

1177
01:22:16,256 --> 01:22:17,657
How dare you threaten me.

1178
01:22:17,658 --> 01:22:22,896
(grunting)

1179
01:22:26,466 --> 01:22:28,468
(yells)

1180
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,616
(screaming)

1181
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,054
(grunting)

1182
01:22:48,055 --> 01:22:50,423

1184
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,996
(grunting)

1185
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:59,399
(crackling)

1186
01:23:00,233 --> 01:23:02,436
(grunting)

1187
01:23:04,404 --> 01:23:08,742
(intense dramatic orchestral music)

1188
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,386
(grunting)

1189
01:23:30,998 --> 01:23:32,698
(gasping)

1190
01:23:32,699 --> 01:23:34,935
(grunting)

1191
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:44,011
(yells)

1192
01:23:46,013 --> 01:23:48,248
(grunting)

1193
01:23:56,256 --> 01:23:58,492
(grunting)

1194
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:09,369
(groaning)

1195
01:24:16,309 --> 01:24:18,478
(yelling)

1196
01:24:27,654 --> 01:24:29,923
(grunting)

1197
01:24:46,006 --> 01:24:50,410
(yelling)
(grunting)

1198
01:25:18,605 --> 01:25:19,605
Three tiger attack!

1199
01:25:19,606 --> 01:25:23,276
(dramatic orchestral music)

1200
01:25:35,856 --> 01:25:38,124
(yelling)

1201
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:40,193
