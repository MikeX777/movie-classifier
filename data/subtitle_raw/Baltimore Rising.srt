1
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,000
Bring yourself back online.

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,417
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,000
Do you know where you are?

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,583
Would you like to wake up
from this dream?

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,959
There's nothing to be afraid of.

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:26,959
Understand?

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,583
Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,165
We must take this matter
into our own hands.

9
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,166
- Our city!
- Our city!

10
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,917
Tell us what you think
of your world.

11
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,500
What do you think of the guests?

12
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,542
Do you know where you are?

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,375
Will the things I told you

14
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,375
change the way you think
about your world?

15
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,792
Do you know where you are?

16
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,332
- I walked down the street
with a reporter

17
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,833
from a national network,
who looked around

18
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:40,499
and saw all of
these boarded-up properties,

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,708
and said to me...

20
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,332
"Councilman, you know,

21
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,249
that riot really tore up
this community, didn't it?"

22
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,165
And I said, "Look again.

23
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,081
"Look at the boards
on those homes.

24
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,208
"Do they look like they were
tacked up yesterday?

25
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:57,207
No, they've been there
20 years, maybe longer."

26
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,499
I said, "The riot didn't
tear up the community.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,541
"The condition of the community

28
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:04,834
caused the uprising
that we had."

29
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,457
- Man, I've been
recording this.

30
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,916
I've been recording.

31
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,207
- When the police
and Freddie Gray

32
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,624
made eye contact,
Freddie Gray ran.

33
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,582
And he was arrested,
essentially,

34
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,499
for running while black.

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,541
- What may have followed
is a so-called "rough ride,"

36
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,916
or a deliberate tactic
used by police

37
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:04,582
to harm unbelted
handcuffed passengers.

38
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,249
- And he emerged
at the end of that ride

39
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,499
with an 80% torn spine.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,040
- We had to get to the hospital

41
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,582
and find out if it was true.

42
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,291
We was thinking that
maybe it was a mistake...

43
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:18,457
maybe they had the wrong room.

44
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,040
This can't be happening
to our Freddie.

45
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,249
No peace!
No justice, no peace!

46
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,582
- That's right!

47
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,708
- We ain't gonna
let this happen no more!

48
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,332
We came to send them
a strong message

49
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,791
that black lives matter!

50
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,500
- Freddie Gray,
a young man arrested

51
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:37,833
by Baltimore City Police
last weekend, has died.

52
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,207
- By the grace of God...

53
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,916
By the grace of God...

54
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,708
- Justice shall prevail.

55
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,959
Justice shall prevail.

56
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,959
- The medical examiner
will list the cause of death

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,125
as trauma to the neck
and spine.

58
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,915
- There were thousands
of protestors at City Hall,

59
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,417
where they had gathered
after marching

60
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:04,040
from the police district

61
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,834
where Freddie Gray
was arrested a week ago.

62
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,709
- You'll see
there's police officers

63
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,458
in riot gear
trying to hold this position.

64
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,207
- I am taken back
by the amount of people

65
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,998
that there are...
community members.

66
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,998
- You're not letting me answer!
- I'm asking you...

67
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,832
- I'm saying to them,
"Family, let me talk to you."

68
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,332
"No, you don't say nothing!

69
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,832
You're one of them!
You're a Nazi!"

70
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,583
And I'm getting
all of this hatred.

71
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,916
Cops! Pigs! Murderers!

72
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,999
- There have been sudden,
spontaneous confrontations...

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,875
- We're not ignorant!
We just want peace.

74
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,999
- But so far,
no major eruptions

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,874
of violence in Baltimore.

76
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,457
- Now, there was information

77
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,873
that there was
these various sites

78
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:45,291
that were going to be targeted

79
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,625
by bands of young people.

80
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,290
- What they did, as smart as

81
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,875
the Baltimore City Police
Department is, they shut down

82
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,708
the Mondawmin Mall
bus terminal.

83
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,457
That's a major terminal.

84
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,958
So you shut that down,
kids can't go nowhere.

85
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,000
- These kids, clearly,
are getting frustrated.

86
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,750
- Rest in peace, Freddie.

87
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,375
- Western Baltimore
is under siege at this moment.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,289
- The real story is that

89
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,542
Freddie Gray was murdered

90
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:30,749
by the police,

91
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,916
and my city took to the streets

92
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,999
and took this city back.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,290
- Hey, guys, they just set
the CVS on fire.

94
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,709
- Hey, did they close
down the street?

95
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,416
- Cop cars
were being destroyed.

96
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,374
Businesses
were being destroyed.

97
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,625
It's like a demon
took over the city.

98
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,957
- Maryland governor
Larry Hogan declared

99
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,250
a state of emergency.

100
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,874
- The governor sends
2,000 national guardsmen

101
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,207
to help police
as Baltimore remains

102
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,834
under a state of emergency.

103
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,291
- Sir, thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

104
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,165
- Might get loose...

105
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,291
- Anybody wear a small?

106
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,249
- I have to make it my size.

107
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,749
Because I get
walking pneumonia.

108
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,374
- I didn't grow up in the hood,

109
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,041
but I always was around
people who did

110
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,165
and always tried
to use the perspective

111
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,374
that I was fortunate enough
to have

112
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,999
by not growing up in the hood

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,959
to be able to say,
"It's not right."

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,374
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

115
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,124
- Everybody get one?

116
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,875
- The first time I heard
about Freddie Gray,

117
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,124
it was on TV.

118
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,583
I was downtown, I was working

119
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:48,916
at the Marriott Waterfront...

120
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,958
and my white coworker,
I remember her saying,

121
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,624
"Oh, my gosh.

122
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,124
Has anybody been hurt?
Has anybody been injured?"

123
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,624
And I remember saying to her,
"Yeah, somebody's been hurt.

124
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,249
"Somebody's been injured.

125
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,164
Somebody died,
and that's what this is about."

126
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:04,164
And she was saying, "No, no.
I'm not talking about that.

127
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,959
I'm talking about the police."
Hands up, don't shoot!

128
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,791
- I mean, something

129
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,665
at that moment, like, snapped
inside of me,

130
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,498
and it was just like,
"Yo, I can't do this."

131
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,000
Like, "I can't just
sit on the sidelines.

132
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,666
This is a part of me."

133
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,373
From that Saturday on,
I would leave work,

134
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,333
and I would go protest
with my cousins.

135
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,999
I want you and Fox News
to get out of Baltimore City,

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,457
because you're not here

137
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,957
reporting
about the boarded up homes

138
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,832
and the homeless people
under MLK.

139
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,500
You're not reporting
about the poverty levels

140
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:31,165
up and down North Avenue.

141
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,791
But you're here for
the black riots that happened.

142
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,416
I didn't know who Geraldo was,

143
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,124
except for some little dude

144
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,165
with a big mustache,
disrespecting the scene.

145
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,041
Everything that had been
bottled up inside of me

146
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:44,457
from before Freddie Gray
was released in that moment.

147
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,874
I want the white media
out of Baltimore City

148
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,791
until y'all come here
to report the real stories.

149
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,666
You know, once I realized

150
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,498
that the cameras had recorded
me, I was concerned

151
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:54,959
about what my father
was going to think,

152
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,624
and so I went home that night.

153
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,373
I saw the video...
it started trending

154
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,083
and trending,
and then three days later,

155
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,041
I was fired.

156
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,332
- The manner of death,
deemed a homicide

157
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,332
by the Maryland state
medical examiner,

158
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,791
is believed to be the result
of a fatal injury

159
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,416
that occurred while
Mr. Gray was unrestrained

160
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,040
by a seat belt in the custody

161
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,708
of a Baltimore Police
Department wagon.

162
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,457
We have probable cause
to file criminal charges.

163
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,208
- Yes! Yes!

164
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,875
- There was jubilation
in the Baltimore neighborhood

165
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,916
where Freddie Gray was killed

166
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,291
after the prosecutor
announced charges.

167
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,957
- This is bigger
than Freddie Gray.

168
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,375
This is bigger
than Trayvon Martin.

169
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,207
This is bigger
than Eric Garner.

170
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,332
This is the way they treat
black people in America, man.

171
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,083
- Stop trying to make us
scared of ISIS

172
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,124
when we need to be scared
of our own judicial system,

173
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,833
'cause that's our terrorist
in our community.

174
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,082
- When we see the police,
our first objective

175
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,166
is not to stand there and get
in compliance... it's to run.

176
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,166
- Like, they chased me.
They didn't find drugs.

177
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,457
So they beat me
in the head with a gun.

178
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,958
- I wish my brother
could have ran,

179
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,290
but he stopped.

180
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,749
He pulled over.

181
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,124
He didn't give nobody
a chase or anything.

182
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,374
He pulled over,
had his hands out the window,

183
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,207
and was executed on the spot!

184
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,082
- A black man don't have
nothing in this world...

185
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,666
nothing.

186
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,625
And that's the end of that.

187
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,374
- Today a judge will decide

188
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,916
if the charges
against the six officers

189
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,457
should be dropped,

190
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,082
if State's Attorney
Marilyn Mosby

191
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,458
should be taken off the case...

192
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,374
- Freddie Gray!
All night...

193
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,958
All day!
- We will fight

194
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,833
for Freddie Gray!
All night...

195
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,834
- Well, once people realized
that there were charges,

196
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:53,582
people felt like, "What are we
protesting for still?"

197
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,541
We will fight for Freddie Gray!

198
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,498
- Sidewalk!
Hey, get on the sidewalk!

199
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,375
- But, you know, I knew,
like, I wasn't done.

200
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,332
I had a mission
that convictions

201
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,916
was to be expected
and Freddie Gray got justice.

202
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,499
- What do we want?
- Justice!

203
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,207
- And when do we want it?
- Now!

204
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,999
- Police admit they were once
caught off guard

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,208
during the riots,

206
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,332
but now they're prepared.

207
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,165
Hey-hey! Ho-ho!

208
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,332
These killer cops
have got to go!

209
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,207
Hey-hey! Ho-ho!

210
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,416
Those killer cops
have got to go!

211
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,332
Hey-hey!
Ho-ho!

212
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,291
These killer cops
have got to go!

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,375
- I'm not resisting!
- Hands behind your head!

214
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:29,999
- I'm hurt.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

215
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,540
- Hands behind your back now!
- I'm hurt!

216
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,041
- You're under arrest.
- I'm hurt!

217
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,958
- I'm gonna Tase you!
- I'm hurt!

218
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,206
I got hit by a...

219
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,250
- Illegal arrest!

220
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,709
Illegal arrest!

221
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,083
- You need to back up.
- Move!

222
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,748
- So we thought
it was really important

223
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,373
to have this civil
disobedience training

224
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:06,208
in the midst
of what's about to happen

225
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:09,124
in Baltimore with the start
of the Freddie Gray trials.

226
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,666
And we just thought
it was extremely necessary

227
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,375
to have this,
especially for students

228
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:16,374
who might be
just recently introduced...

229
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,499
into this.

230
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,748
And while I've engaged

231
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,208
in acts of civil disobedience,

232
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,416
I've never organized one.

233
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:25,708
When I found out that Kwame
had gotten arrested,

234
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,249
I was extremely frightened,

235
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,623
just because I felt like
stakes were getting higher

236
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,417
and that activists
were getting arrested

237
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:35,999
for things that weren't
necessarily threatening.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,749
Protests are symbolic.

239
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,667
They're effective,
but they're also cathartic

240
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:42,541
and therapeutic for the people
who are involved in them.

241
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,040
You need to promise

242
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,832
that you're going to be
ride or die...

243
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,373
well, if you're comfortable
with you're doing that.

244
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,750
Like, you're gonna
be ride or die

245
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,250
for the people
that you're with.

246
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,624
Protest truly is the voice

247
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,000
of people who are unheard,

248
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,749
and protest is not always

249
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,290
a passive action, right?

250
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,125
Protest is not always
marching in the streets,

251
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,124
singing "Kumbaya,"
holding hands,

252
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,959
being silent
and non-disruptive.

253
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,708
- We have to stand
for our sons,

254
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,125
because these are our sons,
and we are sick and tired

255
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,290
of being sick and tired
of their blood

256
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,082
being painted on the streets.

257
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,915
- So people are worried
about, like, the safety

258
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,790
of people who are engaged
in this work

259
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,458
of trying to get justice
for Freddie Gray.

260
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,541
It had a lot to do with the way

261
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,624
protestors had been treated
in the past,

262
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,958
the way I was arrested,
and more and more

263
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,249
as the story grew bigger,
the protests got bigger.

264
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,416
- Mayor
Stephanie Rawlings-Blake

265
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,124
has announced that she plans

266
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,915
to make interim commissioner
Kevin Davis

267
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,665
the new Baltimore City
police commissioner.

268
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,625
- Protesting is not
a privilege, Commissioner.

269
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,124
Protesting is a right
that you have to respect

270
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,333
as a servant of the people,
and that's all I want to say.

271
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,582
- History will one day
look specifically back

272
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,666
at this very moment in time

273
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,332
and identify this year...

274
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,250
probably more than
any other year...

275
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,249
that will serve to define

276
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,290
when American policing
began to change.

277
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,666
It's a challenging time
to be a police officer,

278
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,207
but it's an exciting time
to be a police officer.

279
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:20,291
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

280
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,708
- Good evening, everyone.

281
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,833
Till this day...

282
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,833
Commissioner Davis
has never apologized...

283
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,833
for how peaceful protestors
have been treated...

284
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:37,874
- Yes!

285
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,666
- Arrested...

286
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,290
and are now being prosecuted
by the same State's Attorney

287
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,998
that's supposed to be
bringing charges

288
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,959
against six murderers
that killed Freddie Gray.

289
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,166
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

290
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,708
- Mic check!
- Mic check!

291
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,666
- My voice...
- My voice!

292
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,040
- Will not decide...
- Will not decide!

293
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,583
- If you become...
- If you become!

294
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,081
- The permanent commissioner...

295
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:02,208
The permanent commissioner!

296
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,708
- For my city.

297
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,416
For my city!
- Yet, I will be...

298
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,249
Yet, I will be!
- We will be...

299
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,208
We will be!
- The unarmed black kids...

300
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,416
Unarmed black kids!
- Found unconscious...

301
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,333
Found unconscious!
- In a police van.

302
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,791
In a police van!
- Left dead in the streets.

303
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,290
Dead in the streets!

304
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,791
- No justice!
- No peace!

305
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,708
- No racist!
- Police!

306
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,582
Step up or step down!

307
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,499
Step up or step down!

308
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,583
Step up or step down!

309
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,124
- All right, everybody.

310
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,750
So we're locked inside
of City Hall right now.

311
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,248
They locked the bathrooms.

312
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,581
They've refused to let us
off the balcony

313
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,166
unless we're leaving
the building.

314
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,040
The commissioner
still has not returned.

315
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,582
We just wanted engagement
from Kevin Davis.

316
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,375
It wasn't about
blocking Kevin Davis.

317
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,416
It's mostly about, like,
having a conversation

318
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,749
so that we know what side
Kevin Davis is actually on.

319
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,583
I'm challenging everybody
right now

320
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,958
to use the power
of social media

321
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,332
to demand that
the commissioner comes.

322
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,374
- So thumbs for
are we committed

323
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,749
to staying here?

324
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,791
Yes, maybe, no.

325
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,708
- I want to stay.

326
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,874
- Thumb, thumbs?
- Yes, yes.

327
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,916
- To go home?
- This has just been

328
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,624
the unanimous decision
that we're not leaving

329
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,040
until Kevin Davis

330
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,709
and Mayor
Stephanie Rawlings-Blake

331
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,457
are with us.
- Okay.

332
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,165
- Protestors are still
inside City Hall,

333
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,666
refusing to leave.

334
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,666
Now, we've confirmed
that Kevin Davis

335
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,041
is not inside with them.

336
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,456
- You will have to
leave the building.

337
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,083
I don't know. I'm trying...
- Is this a warning

338
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,457
before our arrest?
- To see if we... well...

339
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,249
- Excuse me.
Good evening.

340
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,833
Can I have everybody's
attention?

341
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,331
- Let her finish talking,
'cause that was

342
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:37,039
very disrespectful
to your colleague.

343
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,834
- Please. I am lawfully
ordering all of you

344
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,332
who are assembled here
inside of City Hall

345
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,833
to leave the building
immediately

346
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,833
and peacefully disperse.
- Kwame, shh.

347
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,333
- You shall leave immediately
or be subject to arrest.

348
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,624
- It is our duty
to fight for our freedom.

349
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,958
Is our duty
to fight for our freedom.

350
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,207
- We have nothing to lose
but our chains!

351
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,040
We have nothing
to lose but our chains!

352
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,582
- It is our duty
to fight for our freedom!

353
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,082
It is our duty
to fight for our freedom!

354
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,124
- We have nothing to lose
but our chains!

355
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,749
We have nothing
to lose but our chains!

356
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,624
- Black lives matter!

357
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,666
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

358
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,082
Black lives matter!

359
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,041
- Baltimore City
has a new top cop.

360
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,916
The city council voted
12-2 to confirm Kevin Davis

361
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,542
as the new police commissioner
for Baltimore City.

362
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,833
- It's a exciting time,

363
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,582
but it's also
a very trying time,

364
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,833
because I don't know...
this is her senior year,

365
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,583
and I don't know where
things are going to go

366
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,624
with regard to
the Freddie Gray trial.

367
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,291
Last year was
a very difficult year.

368
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,749
Her grades fell.

369
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,416
I was very disappointed,

370
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:48,749
because I put you
on a path for success,

371
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,916
and now you're letting it fall

372
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,750
because you're doing
all of this work.

373
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:56,124
Education, in my book,
comes first, you know?

374
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,915
You know, people always ask me,
"Where does she...

375
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,834
where does she get this from?"
And, um...

376
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,874
her speaking, she definitely
gets from her dad,

377
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,332
but I think her spirit,

378
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,708
she gets from my brother,
her uncle.

379
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,583
My brother was on death row
for ten years.

380
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:10,749
I think he was 32
when he was executed.

381
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,916
He started doing
live interviews

382
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,416
from death row, so that's when
we became very active

383
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,208
campaigning against
the death penalty,

384
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,040
and then I became
pregnant with Makayla.

385
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,582
We have pictures of her

386
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,165
in my husband's arms, marching.

387
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,791
So she was born into that.

388
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,958
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

389
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,833
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

390
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,416
- I always told her
that our protest chants,

391
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,291
"no justice, no peace,"
were her lullabies.

392
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,874
And I said, "You marched

393
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,291
before you could crawl
and walk."

394
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:37,999
Indict, convict,

395
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,125
send those killer cops to jail.
The whole damn system...

396
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,207
- I'm always reminded
of my uncle's resilience

397
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,125
and how, even on death row...
when he knew

398
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:46,123
that his death was pending
and he knew

399
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:47,792
that his death was coming,
and he even had

400
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:50,082
a date of his death,
he was still organizing,

401
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,250
and he was doing everything
with his time that he could.

402
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,457
You can go to
killedbypolice.net,

403
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,124
and you can begin
to read the names off.

404
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,749
We need to recognize
and hear all of the names

405
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,708
of all of the victims, right?

406
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:14,164
And we need to say their names.
We need to feel their spirits.

407
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,498
We need to feel their energy
and make this a moment

408
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:18,208
where we're committing to
ourselves

409
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,457
to no longer wait
until another name

410
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,165
is added to that list,

411
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,958
'cause we can't afford to lose
another baby like Tamir.

412
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:28,082
We can't afford to lose
another sister like Sandra.

413
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,582
We can't afford any of that.

414
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,041
- Darius Smith.
- Wesley Manning.

415
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,541
- Dejuan Hall.
- Brandon Johnson.

416
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,375
- DeOntre Dorsey.
- William Lemmon.

417
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:36,457
- Patrick O'Grady.
Philip Quinn.

418
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,499
- Jason Mesaros.
- Ernesto Lopez.

419
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,499
- Eddie Sanchez.
- Joseph Khammash.

420
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,250
- Antonio Henry.
- Kenneth Pinter Jr.

421
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:44,249
- Adarius Brown.
- Keith McLeod.

422
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,542
- Leonel Acevedo.

423
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,832
- So, Father God,
first and foremost,

424
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,458
I want to thank You for sparing
the lives, Father God,

425
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:55,500
of Britney and Genisha,
Father God.

426
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,165
But, Father God,
our concentration,

427
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,082
our focus...

428
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,749
goes on those, Father God,

429
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,540
that were seriously injured,
Father God...

430
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,417
even ejected
from the vehicles, oh, God.

431
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:07,999
Where does it hurt?

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,374
- It isn't hurting,
it's just shaking.

433
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,667
- Okay, so just relax.

434
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,542
You're gonna be all right.

435
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,874
All right?
- Okay.

436
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,041
- Look, I ain't hard to find
if y'all need me.

437
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,916
It's my city.
Love my city.

438
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,249
We're in a community where...

439
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,542
it's underserved
and over-policed.

440
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:42,708
You could be a great cop.

441
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:45,082
You could be a great cop
and a successful cop...

442
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,542
probably even more so
when you learn how

443
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:50,499
to be respectful
to the community.

444
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,250
So we're... we're in
the Gilmor area,

445
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:54,833
which is where, actually,
Freddie Gray...

446
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:58,082
was arrested.

447
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,250
That mural went up
almost immediately.

448
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,581
The Freddie Gray incident
wasn't the cause

449
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,709
of the uprising... it was just
probably that last straw

450
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,291
that broke the camel's back...
after decades of crying out.

451
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,124
There were a group
of individuals

452
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,623
who helped us throughout
the entire uprising.

453
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:20,834
They wanted to sit down
and talk

454
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:22,416
with the commissioner

455
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,333
about how we can better
work together

456
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:26,625
to see that peace
come back around.

457
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,290
You are the peacemakers.

458
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,792
You are the ones
who I've called on

459
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:33,499
in months past, years past,

460
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
when things were happening,
and said, "We need help."

461
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,124
And you have always
come through.

462
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,792
Some of you don't even know
each other,

463
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:41,207
so the common denominator here
is me, right?

464
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,749
But more importantly,

465
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,289
the common denominator here
is Baltimore,

466
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,039
and so what the commissioner
has asked

467
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,915
is, hypothetically,
if something else kicked off...

468
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,915
if anything kicked off...
are there people that you know,

469
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,709
that when we get
some information,

470
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,165
that you can pass
that information on to

471
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,125
so it doesn't blow up
in our face?

472
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:58,499
- It'd be one thing
if the uprising

473
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,791
and the unrest were behind us.

474
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,041
Part of it's behind us,

475
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,165
but we got a big
front windshield

476
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,666
that we're looking out,
and there are absolutely

477
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,834
expectations that we need
to manage in this city,

478
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:13,332
and I don't think the city
is doing a good job

479
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,916
at managing expectations
for these trials.

480
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,916
Baltimore... this uniform
is the most recognizable

481
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,249
police department
in the country right now.

482
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,667
And people are looking at us

483
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:24,374
to see if we can
get this right.

484
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,374
- A lot of the kids,
I'm telling you for a fact,

485
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,874
literally sitting around,

486
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,499
waiting for the next
opportunity to go out

487
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,582
and do what they think
is voicing their frustrations.

488
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,458
- We got that.
That's good, that's good.

489
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,082
We got that.
Catalina?

490
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,249
- So begin to identify
the people that will work

491
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,041
on behalf of the people
of Baltimore,

492
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,541
'cause we all love our city,

493
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,123
and we loved it before
it was popular

494
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:46,540
to say you loved it
and it was a brand.

495
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,998
- Yes.
- Why don't we start

496
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,707
getting out into
the schools right now,

497
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,500
having assemblies,
and then talk to them about,

498
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:54,791
"This is your city.
You have to value your city.

499
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,250
"You know,
no matter what happens,

500
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:57,874
you still have to live here."

501
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,834
- Well, first of all,
allow me to apologize,

502
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:03,374
'cause I'm not as well-spoken
as some of my counterparts.

503
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:07,332
I'm a retired gang member, sir,
if there is such a thing.

504
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,874
And excuse me
for being incredibly frank.

505
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:13,541
You have to treat
those officers like people.

506
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,708
They shouldn't have never had
ten days

507
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,916
to discuss their story.

508
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:21,916
Major problem.

509
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,416
You have two sides
of your city, Chief,

510
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,416
and part of your city,
they're expecting

511
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:27,833
everybody to walk.

512
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,582
Some of them,
unfortunately...

513
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,207
and I hate to admit it...
are waiting for them to walk.

514
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,791
Just my opinion.

515
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,332
- My selfish interest,

516
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,040
on behalf of the city
right now,

517
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,124
is surviving this moment.

518
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,666
Right?
We can't get through this

519
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,541
without you guys.

520
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,290
And I give my cell phone number
out to everybody.

521
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,834
And I've had people tell me,
"Why do you give

522
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:49,374
your cell phone number?"

523
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,873
I'll give it to everybody
in this room.

524
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,581
Now, now, I do that because
I know

525
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:53,915
that if you guys didn't
care about this city,

526
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,083
you wouldn't be in here.

527
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:56,624
If we can't, as a city,

528
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,166
get through
these six trials together...

529
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:01,332
with just protests
and no violence...

530
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,000
we will take ten giant
steps backwards.

531
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,958
- I just want to get into
treatment as soon as possible.

532
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,750
- Okay, what is
your drug of choice?

533
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:20,290
- Heroin.
- All right.

534
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,290
Age of first use?
- Of anything?

535
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,124
- Of anything.
- 13, marijuana.

536
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,791
- Next thing?

537
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:29,249
- 14, cocaine.

538
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,792
- Wow, how'd you graduate
that fast?

539
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,249
What was his name?

540
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,290
- John.

541
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,250
- Awesome.
All right.

542
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,833
My job is to refer clients,
translate,

543
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:46,332
and advocate for clients
suffering from dual diagnosis

544
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,250
and/or drug abuse.

545
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,582
To date, I've sent
successfully to treatment

546
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,417
1,785 people.

547
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,582
I think maybe seven,
eight days ago,

548
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,291
I just met with
the commissioner, Davis...

549
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:08,833
the new dude...
and they're trying to help us,

550
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,750
first of all, kind of
police our own.

551
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:13,666
What we don't want is a repeat
of what happened in April.

552
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,373
- They really do got to build
a relationship

553
00:24:15,374 --> 00:24:16,915
with the community first,
because don't nobody

554
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,834
in the community trust them.
- Right.

555
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:21,374
- You got to get them
something... jobs, something.

556
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,206
Give them something to do.
Something.

557
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:25,665
- So, basically, just let me
know what it is you need.

558
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,331
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause if we can facilitate

559
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,000
this, it'd create
a lot of opportunity

560
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,040
for a bunch of different
things, mostly for our kids.

561
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,250
You know what I'm saying?
The schools around here.

562
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:37,667
We can reduce
the police presence greatly.

563
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,792
- This is the voice mailbox
for Kevin Davis,

564
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:44,958
police commissioner
for the city of Baltimore.

565
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,333
- Hello, Commissioner Davis.

566
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,499
This is Genard Barr,
aka Mr. Shadow.

567
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,165
We met, um...

568
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,791
a little bit over a week ago.

569
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,709
You remember the question,
"What can we do

570
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,207
"to prevent a second uprising
if the trial does not go

571
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,582
quite like we thought?"

572
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,624
I believe I have an answer
for you.

573
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,582
I hope this reaches you
in peace,

574
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,164
and just as a side note,
I'll be bugging

575
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:05,417
the hell out of you
until I talk to you.

576
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,166
Thank you very much, sir.

577
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,164
- Jury selection
begins in the morning

578
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:14,083
in the trial of the first
of the six police officers

579
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,374
charged in the death
of Freddie Gray.

580
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,250
- Officer William Porter
is accused

581
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,249
of involuntary manslaughter,

582
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,417
reckless endangerment,
and assault.

583
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:33,249
- I always had pride in being
a law enforcement officer,

584
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,165
but... now, it's like...

585
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,166
people don't feel the same way.

586
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,999
I feel like a linebacker.

587
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,416
I'm one of the investigators
in the case.

588
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:50,249
So we have the court cases
coming up very soon...

589
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,582
the start of those...
and, um, you know,

590
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,082
that's, um...

591
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,749
you know, that's gonna be
a huge deal

592
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,417
for everybody involved.

593
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,791
And I don't know exactly
when I'll be testifying

594
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:04,249
in that case.

595
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,792
We're just kind of
in standby mode.

596
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,624
It's discouraging
when you just watch

597
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,708
people pit races
against each other,

598
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:17,458
the community
against the police.

599
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,958
See, out here you have to
kind of pick your poison.

600
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,082
You got to pick your poison,
you know,

601
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,499
what you're gonna
get engaged in.

602
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,541
When you got
young black men like this

603
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:50,624
who are just walking around
the street aimlessly...

604
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,999
you know...

605
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,666
they're doing
one of two things.

606
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,666
They're up to no good,
or they're selling drugs,

607
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,166
and then the next thing
you know,

608
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,958
you're gonna have a shooting,

609
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,874
and these are the results.

610
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,666
Graveyards... jails.

611
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,625
So, you know...

612
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,207
- Back in the late '50s
and early '60s,

613
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,541
Penn North was the cultural
center of Baltimore

614
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:28,541
because it was the home,
among other things,

615
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,666
of numerous jazz clubs.

616
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:33,166
This was the heyday
of the black family.

617
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,791
We didn't have drugs.
We didn't have guns.

618
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,165
You didn't see all
of these vacant houses.

619
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,708
It was an "onward, upward"
kind of feeling

620
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,499
about Baltimore.

621
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,124
The police were basically
foot patrolmen.

622
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,207
They knew who the bad kids
were in any given family,

623
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,999
who the good people were,

624
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,083
because they were familiar
with the community.

625
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:01,749
Blacks were treated
a lot differently

626
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,624
after the advent
of the motorized squad car.

627
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,708
And so, instead of
walking the beat,

628
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:09,375
the police department
in Baltimore

629
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,791
went from hot spot to hot spot.

630
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,958
They didn't learn
the community after that.

631
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:19,332
Then in 1968,
when we had the riots...

632
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,333
things went downhill
from there.

633
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,833
Add that to mass incarceration,

634
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,749
to mass arrests
in the black community...

635
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,916
now we have the destruction

636
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,749
of the same black families

637
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,208
who were thriving
in that part of town.

638
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:50,874
- My father was a cop.
Useless.

639
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,790
The dude my mother married
after my father

640
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:54,000
was also a cop.

641
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,582
He spent...

642
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,957
a good five years abusing me,

643
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,917
and that began the hatred
of cops...

644
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,541
the ineffective father

645
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,833
and the piece-of-shit
stepfather.

646
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,624
Around 15 or 16 or so,

647
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:08,124
I couldn't deal
with that anymore, so I left.

648
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,874
You know, there's only certain
ways a 16-year-old dude

649
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,499
is gonna take care of himself.

650
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,040
The environment I was stuck in

651
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,875
or pushed upon me,
or however the hell

652
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:21,624
you want to put that,
turned me into something else

653
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,332
for a means of survival.

654
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,332
I don't want my kids
to be turned into anything.

655
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,959
I want my kids to grow up
to be my kids.

656
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,583
- Hey, baby.

657
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,581
- Hey, Shadow.
- Oh, yeah, that's my...

658
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,164
- How you doing, man?
How are you?

659
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,834
- How you doing?
- Sorry I'm late. You good?

660
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,874
- Nah, actually, it worked out
that you're late.

661
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,125
- Hey, how are you?
Kevin Davis.

662
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:58,708
You know, why this year

663
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,290
and why right now

664
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:03,207
and why...
why post-April to May

665
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,666
is everything off the chain?

666
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,331
- You know,
when you're in a situation

667
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:09,083
where you have 7,000 people
and 300 jobs...

668
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:12,040
Things can be out of control.

669
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:16,332
Then on our side,
seven, eight generations

670
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,040
of fatherless boys.

671
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,500
And the only time
we ever see y'all

672
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:22,749
is y'all taking
our fathers from us.

673
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,791
- I hear you.

674
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,499
- That's why.
- And it just bubbled here.

675
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,331
- There are no
recreation centers.

676
00:30:29,332 --> 00:30:31,583
There's nothing for kids to do.
There's nothing here.

677
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:33,874
- We are so angry...

678
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,249
and so upset.

679
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,917
We sit here,
and we have nothing to do,

680
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,749
so we agitating each other.

681
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,791
And then we have the cops
on top of our backs.

682
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:43,373
- Some of these dudes...
I done seen some of these cats

683
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,039
strip search people
in the street.

684
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,917
If you ever try to put
your finger in my ass,

685
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:48,915
talking about something,
you want to search for

686
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,498
some drugs, I don't give a fuck
whether he got a badge or not,

687
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:51,917
I'm gonna stab him in his neck.

688
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,874
- I'm sorry that
law enforcement

689
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,874
in this community is like this.

690
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,290
- If you want to make
a change now...

691
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,290
I don't know who or how
we have to do it...

692
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,289
- You do... you do a lot...
- No, please let me finish.

693
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,166
- You do a lot.
- No, please let me finish.

694
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,749
Please let me finish.

695
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,289
I went through shit
that I should not have to.

696
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,873
I'm not even supposed to
be sitting here.

697
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:12,415
I got a bullet hole
in my head, Chief.

698
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,083
And that will not happen
to my children.

699
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:15,582
Do you understand?

700
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,666
This will not happen
to my children.

701
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,124
I will die doing this.

702
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,332
Okay?

703
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,916
- Your pain's not my pain.

704
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,291
I've never lived your life.

705
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:27,124
But that still...

706
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,833
Excuse me.

707
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:34,249
- Doesn't mean that...

708
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,124
- It won't happen
to my children.

709
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:39,541
I promise you, I have an army
of likeminded individuals.

710
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,249
But they're afraid of you all.

711
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,290
And until they stop...
- That breaks my heart.

712
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,791
- And until they stop
being afraid of you all,

713
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:50,624
it's gonna seem like
I'm doing it by myself.

714
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,749
Here's the deal...

715
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,833
- What do they want?
- Jobs.

716
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:58,124
- We need jobs.
- Jobs.

717
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,458
- We need them.
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,457
Can I be an advocate for jobs?

719
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,249
Yes.
Can I go over...

720
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,416
and stand in City Hall
and jump up and down?

721
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,374
Yes.

722
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,958
Will I? Yes.

723
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,624
But you know
my personal ability

724
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:15,374
as a police commissioner
to create jobs... is what?

725
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,790
- Hmm.
- For this moment in time,

726
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:17,959
I got the bully pulpit,

727
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,749
and I'll stand up with you

728
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,709
and go to whoever
those people are

729
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,499
who can make change.

730
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,290
I'll do that, but I need
you to promise me

731
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:31,332
that we're not gonna have
what we had in April and May.

732
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,791
Can you deliver that?
- Yeah.

733
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,582
- Yeah.
- To the best of my ability.

734
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,456
- This is the problem
that we're having,

735
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,291
with, you know,
the guys in the fraternity...

736
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,749
guys, you know...

737
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,833
They are worried about,
"If we take this step,

738
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,999
will y'all take
this step with us?"

739
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,959
You know, because they don't
want to look like fools,

740
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,708
and they don't want
any backlash.

741
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,373
- I don't want to
look like a fool either.

742
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:54,331
- You know,
it's time for us to stand...

743
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:56,375
- Give me a couple...
Test me, then. Test the waters.

744
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:58,373
Give me a couple things
you want me to do.

745
00:32:58,374 --> 00:32:59,873
- We been talking about it
all year, bro.

746
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,748
- A football game,
a basketball game.

747
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,665
- We want a football game, man.
We want to play ball.

748
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,289
But you get what I'm saying?
Like, just like we're playing

749
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,834
cops and robbers
when we was kids,

750
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:08,374
let's put on some pads...

751
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,206
'cause it's a lot
of athletes out here, Chief.

752
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:11,834
I can still run, man.
- Yeah? All right. I can't.

753
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,957
- I'm about to go meet up
with my attorney.

754
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,333
I'm not taking no charges.

755
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,916
I'm not taking no conviction.

756
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,832
But I also want
to send a message, like,

757
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,915
this is not about to
keep happening to protestors

758
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,375
who haven't broken the law
and have only been exercising

759
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,499
their First Amendment right.

760
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
- You are on the scene.
They're gonna come to you

761
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:36,082
because, for good or for bad,

762
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,750
you are seen as a leader
of the movement.

763
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:39,874
- I'm, like, the only protestor
facing, like,

764
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,916
serious jail time, you know.

765
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,916
I'm the most visible person.

766
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:47,207
- Arrest is the last resort,
and that is a citable offense.

767
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:51,082
Right, so the only reason,
from my experience,

768
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,582
that somebody in command
would make an arrest

769
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,040
is if it's pre-planned.

770
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,581
- Where would that directive
come from,

771
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:58,415
from your experience,
when you were there?

772
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,248
- It's gonna come from Command.
It's not gonna come from...

773
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,665
it's gonna come from somebody
that is a captain or above.

774
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,792
Somebody that's in what they
call "Command Staff."

775
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,332
- The perception that you have
nothing to lose,

776
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,124
that's a scary thing for people
who got a whole lot to lose.

777
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:11,624
So that's the threat you pose.

778
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,290
Whether you mean to express
that threat or not,

779
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,458
to the establishment,
that's what you represent.

780
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:29,124
- This is my last one, I swear.

781
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,709
For today.

782
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:38,624
I don't get why they're picking
this bone so hard.

783
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,958
- But that is why
they're picking the bone.

784
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,958
- Yeah.
- So they can hold you back

785
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,999
during the whole next...
I don't know.

786
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,832
When's this gonna be?
Six months, seven months?

787
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,291
- I am still gonna protest.

788
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:51,958
I'm still gonna be out here
before my case.

789
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,083
- Well, it's your constitutional
right to protest.

790
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:56,875
- Well, I don't get
those rights.

791
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,207
- We have heard
closing arguments

792
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,791
in the final phase

793
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,540
of the Officer William Porter
trial.

794
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,250
Right now the prosecution
has wrapped up

795
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:10,416
its portion
of closing arguments.

796
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,792
- Prosecutors contend
Porter is criminally negligent

797
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:15,374
because he didn't call a medic
when Gray requested one

798
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,791
and he didn't buckle Gray
into a seat belt.

799
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:21,791
- Have you ever been inside
of a police van?

800
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,874
And I'm like this, right?
Now, you got a back door here.

801
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,624
Now, if she has
this much room...

802
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,373
because, remember,
you have a wall here

803
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,039
that divides both sides
of the wagon.

804
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,417
- It's narrow in the back.
- So what can I do

805
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:32,874
to her from here?

806
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,456
I could kick her.
I could punch her.

807
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:36,164
- I'm over here...
- I could spit on her.

808
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:38,083
I can do this, but...
- I'm not gonna put myself

809
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:40,416
through that,
because when I get injured,

810
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:43,207
first of all, the city not
gonna want to take care of me.

811
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,957
- We had the gentleman
that came here...

812
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,250
it took six guys to try to
get him out of the cell

813
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:49,748
and he said, "You're gonna
have to Freddie Gray me

814
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:51,208
"out of this motherfucker,

815
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:53,666
because I'm not walking
on my two feet."

816
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,708
- It puts everybody at risk.

817
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,791
- It's crazy.

818
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,749
- Right now, since April,
the community,

819
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:04,874
the Command, the government,

820
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:08,249
the media, has effectively
erased the blue line

821
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,917
that protected all
of these people

822
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,958
and the result is, you know,
a record year,

823
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:16,166
and it's only gonna get worse
and worse and worse.

824
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,290
- Well, the death
of Freddie Gray

825
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,583
has put a glaring spotlight on
Baltimore

826
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:23,165
and its police force.

827
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,833
In the months
since Gray's death,

828
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,916
arrests in Baltimore
have plunged.

829
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,916
Murders have actually surged.

830
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:31,290
- After the uprising
in Baltimore City,

831
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,499
I talked to the police
in West Baltimore.

832
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,290
They were saying,
"Colonel, can we keep it real?

833
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,206
"We're tired of getting
out of the cars.

834
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,748
"We got to keep
looking over our heads

835
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:41,542
"and ducking bottles
and dirty diapers

836
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:45,207
"and all this crap, and we just
want to do our job.

837
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:47,000
"When we make a legitimate,
good arrest,

838
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:50,124
"all the cameras come... wham,
in our face!

839
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:54,374
And just hatred being spewed.
Colonel, that hurts."

840
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,332
Facts speak for themselves.

841
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,541
And I understand it.

842
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,583
We stopped policing.

843
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,123
- We carry our children.
We feed them.

844
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,000
We do all the right things
for them.

845
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,708
And then one day we wake up
and get a phone call that said,

846
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,332
"Ms. Austin,
homicide is coming.

847
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,790
They want to talk to you."

848
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,083
My husband went to the scene,

849
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:19,207
and there was
our 22-year-old son

850
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:22,499
at a block party
with his brains blown out.

851
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,583
- They say black don't crack.

852
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,249
Shit, my brother sent me

853
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,041
a picture he took of a guy
laying on the concrete

854
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:30,040
with his top peeled back
like a convertible Honda.

855
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,207
We praying for mamas.
Our kids are going to paradise.

856
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,375
No, no, no, not the Bahamas.

857
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,708
- You guys know Petey?

858
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:43,708
Here, I want y'all to take
some of these.

859
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,999
I want y'all to take
some of these flyers,

860
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,666
'cause y'all his friends, right?

861
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,332
Back in my day,

862
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,999
if something like this
happened down here,

863
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,833
those people who
this was intended for...

864
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,333
they wouldn't even be allowed

865
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:58,416
to even stand on a corner again

866
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:00,666
until they did the right thing
for this family.

867
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:03,708
- Right.

868
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,165
- You got people dying
in neighborhoods

869
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,582
where they grew up at,
and people say

870
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,917
absolutely nothing.

871
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:18,416
Thinking back to...
to all the memories

872
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:20,457
I had as a child...

873
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,333
thinking about all
the other families

874
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:26,040
falling apart...

875
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:30,332
I don't think a child
should ever have to go through

876
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:33,791
what I went through.

877
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:39,666
You had the Stanfields, who
ran this entire area out here.

878
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,249
They always used my house

879
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,874
as, like, the stash house.

880
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,207
So we'd be in there
sleeping with guns.

881
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:50,165
Every guy in that house,
every guy in that organization

882
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,624
was a pedophile.

883
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:55,416
None of them could keep
their hands to themselves,

884
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:58,791
and I'd get in trouble,
because I would open up

885
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:01,457
one of their packs, and...

886
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,708
they always had liquor
and different stuff.

887
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:07,249
So I would pour... like,
take a bunch of heroin

888
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,582
and pour it in a cup
and pour alcohol in it,

889
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,582
and I'd sit there and think,

890
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:18,541
"If I drink this,
how fast would I die?"

891
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,332
And I used to play
with the guns.

892
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,332
I'd pick it up,
look at it and figure...

893
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,083
I used to always sit there
and think,

894
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:26,916
"This is gonna make a mess.

895
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,083
"How are they gonna find me?
I'm not even gonna die.

896
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:31,916
And I'm gonna still
be right back here."

897
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,249
And, um... and I was...

898
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,583
you know, 15 years old.

899
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,456
- So, if you had a chance
to play football

900
00:39:43,457 --> 00:39:45,123
against the police,
what would you do?

901
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:46,707
- Well, play... play my heart out
against the police.

902
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,625
- I'm saying...
- Against the police?

903
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:50,791
Yeah, I would definitely catch

904
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,874
a few "unnecessary
roughness"-es.

905
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,332
15-yard penalties.

906
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,458
I would definitely catch a few.
- So they know the deal.

907
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,123
- The only time we see
the police officers

908
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:05,790
is when they're pointing guns
at me and calling me

909
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,166
a dickhead or an asshole
or some shit like that...

910
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:08,958
shooting some unarmed dude.

911
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,874
How can I treat you
like a person

912
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,790
when you never act like one,
and how do I get you

913
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,750
to do that in a neighborhood
you don't live in?

914
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:17,416
What better do you know
to do that than football?

915
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,500
- Oh, I know I should have
brought my cleats today.

916
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,332
- On one side, you had people
and kids from out

917
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:26,166
in the community...
you know, the "normals."

918
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:29,040
Then you have gang members
and whoever else,

919
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,666
and they're all
playing together

920
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,000
on the same team
against the police.

921
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:36,125
- You have a good game today?
- What's up, man?

922
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:38,249
Hold up, fellas!
Come here, come here, for real!

923
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,958
Last time, I swear.
Come here.

924
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,623
The gentleman standing
behind me...

925
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:43,164
- It's all good.
- Lieutenant Colonel...

926
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:44,917
They ain't all bad.
Please remember that

927
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:47,250
when we get all this
incidental contact.

928
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,749
- Set. Hit!

929
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,499
- You got Bloods and Crips,

930
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,832
don't fucking like each other,
on one fucking team.

931
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,332
Motherfuckers was fighting

932
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,082
and shit in the alleyways,
like, a week ago.

933
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,958
- Maybe about ten
of those guys,

934
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,499
I see on a daily basis,

935
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,499
and sometimes it's not
in a positive light.

936
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,165
So, to do something like this,

937
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,832
it really changes
the relationship.

938
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,331
- This is what the truce
looks like.

939
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:14,250
This is every set
in the city right now...

940
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:16,040
fittin' to play a game

941
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,791
against the last people
we want to be playing with.

942
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,041
- All we asking...

943
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:22,874
for 'em to be...
more considerate.

944
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,959
We are human beings, too,
you feel what I'm saying?

945
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,791
They bleed just like us.
They live just like us.

946
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:30,332
- I'm looking around,
see all these police out here.

947
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,417
Why they couldn't leave their
guns and handcuffs in the car?

948
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:33,917
We out here playing football.

949
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:36,124
I still feel nervous,

950
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,874
man, like...

951
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,707
- Whether the city is here
in the stands today or not,

952
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,331
it doesn't matter...
the city is watching us.

953
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,750
Yeah.
- The city is watching

954
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,290
the police, as they should be.

955
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,083
But if we can't do this,
who's gonna do it?

956
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,583
- Nobody.
- Nobody's gonna do it.

957
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,124
- One, two, three!
- Family!

958
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,875
- Let's play ball, guys.
Let's play ball.

959
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,082
- All right!

960
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,540
- Hey, it's flag football.

961
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,750
Calm down a little bit,
all right?

962
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,916
- Look at this.
Look at this.

963
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,250
That is a bad play.
Bad play.

964
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,374
- Let's go, let's go, 17!
- Let's go 17!

965
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,082
- Go, baby!
- He can throw.

966
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,873
He's gonna beat you if you don't
jam him at the line!

967
00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:17,667
- Ah, he's going deep,
he's going deep!

968
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,916
- He ain't putting
no hands on him, man.

969
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,916
- He let him get past him.
- It's all right.

970
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,082
- If we lose, everybody
on foot for a week.

971
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,291
I'm serious.
Straight up.

972
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:29,040
- All right, where's the ball?

973
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30,748
- I'm serious.
We got females on the field.

974
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,707
I'm gonna say it out loud...
let the flag be

975
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,041
be the only thing you grab.

976
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:35,959
That's right.

977
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,456
- First of all,
we wouldn't have even won

978
00:42:53,457 --> 00:42:55,083
if it wasn't for y'all,
so round of applause

979
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:56,749
for my youngsters.

980
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,374
All right?
- Whoo!

981
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,250
- Come on,
let's get group pictures!

982
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:02,124
Okay, my front row right here,

983
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,457
take a knee like you...
you know, football pose.

984
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,708
When I say "one city,"
you say "one purpose"!

985
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,457
- One city!
- One purpose!

986
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,999
I love that.

987
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
- Deuces!

988
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,333
- I don't understand
why you just won't...

989
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:20,833
Can you take a plea deal?

990
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:22,625
- Do you think
I did something wrong?

991
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:24,833
- Yes.
You had a blow horn

992
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,916
at the courthouse.

993
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,958
- You know, I think
that I was targeted.

994
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:32,040
- You were.

995
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:34,541
- With the megaphone
out front of the courthouse...

996
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,500
- When did that become
against the law?

997
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:39,207
- It's a nuisance... they're
conducting business inside.

998
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,125
- I had the bullhorn out there
for three days.

999
00:43:41,126 --> 00:43:44,250
- Okay, and after a while,
they got tired of it.

1000
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:51,040
- Y'all haven't accepted me
for being me.

1001
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,540
- We want you to look
at the long term.

1002
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:53,792
What happens when...

1003
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:56,207
- I don't think
about long term.

1004
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:58,541
You know, I don't really,
like...

1005
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:02,249
have a longing
for, like, material possessions.

1006
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,709
- Okay.

1007
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:09,624
- I'm content.

1008
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:12,040
- You're homeless.
- What?

1009
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,624
- You're homeless.
- I am not.

1010
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:15,708
- You are.
- I'm not looking for a home.

1011
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:17,999
- You're broke.
- Yes, you have no money.

1012
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,541
You're broke.
- Give me a loan.

1013
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:22,374
- No, the goal is
to make the bird fly.

1014
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:24,958
- I'm looking
for somebody to love me.

1015
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,291
- We love you, but you can't
stay in my basement.

1016
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,291
- No, love me the way
I'm looking for.

1017
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,834
These are my parents.

1018
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:34,331
Who try to teach you
responsibility.

1019
00:44:34,332 --> 00:44:36,333
- It's reality, baby.
- I don't want responsibility.

1020
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:38,250
- Exactly.

1021
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,333
- In Baltimore,
residents and officials

1022
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:48,499
are anxiously awaiting
a verdict

1023
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,916
in the first trial
in the death of Freddie Gray.

1024
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:53,665
And the head of the city's
public schools

1025
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,583
has issued a letter
to the community

1026
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:59,374
warning students that walkouts
and any form of violence

1027
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:02,791
are not acceptable.

1028
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:05,123
- So today we received
a letter from Dr. Thornton,

1029
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:07,000
the CEO of the Baltimore City
Public School system,

1030
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:10,624
regarding the upcoming verdict.

1031
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,958
"While we appreciate
the school board's effort

1032
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:14,289
to keep..."
- "Students safe."

1033
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,790
- Students safe.
- You should say,

1034
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,750
"The school board's
newfound effort."

1035
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:20,165
That's shady, that's shady.

1036
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,624
- Oh!
- So what action

1037
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,291
are you all planning?
- We're planning

1038
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:25,040
an emergency student walkout.

1039
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:28,582
If the verdict comes
during the school day.

1040
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,791
- So you all are planning
a walkout...

1041
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,666
with the letter in mind...

1042
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:35,666
that said that consequences
will occur

1043
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,749
as a result of a walkout?
- Yep.

1044
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,708
- We can't afford
another arrest.

1045
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,416
- They can't make arrests
until they give three warnings.

1046
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,124
- They can shoot you
and kill you

1047
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,959
without giving you a warning,
so why do you trust

1048
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,208
that they are going
to give you three warnings?

1049
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:54,332
And once again,
here we are, not doing

1050
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,958
what you're supposed
to be doing

1051
00:45:55,959 --> 00:45:57,417
because everything
is so much more important

1052
00:45:57,418 --> 00:45:59,249
than Makayla.

1053
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,166
- Do you want me to ask them
to leave now?

1054
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,624
- I'm talking about you.

1055
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,291
At what point
are we going to start

1056
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:06,165
what we planned to do today?

1057
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,791
- When we finish this.

1058
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:09,833
- When is that?
- I don't... Mom, I don't...

1059
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,374
I just said I don't know.

1060
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,165
- And when is the deadline?

1061
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:16,082
- I sent you all the deadlines.
They're not until January.

1062
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:17,748
- Everybody in there
have applied for college.

1063
00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:18,917
- Okay.
- Right?

1064
00:46:18,918 --> 00:46:20,791
- Yep.

1065
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:22,833
- Okay.
"Yep."

1066
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,333
"Yep, yep."
Okay.

1067
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:41,165
- So the idea is this...
when the riots happened,

1068
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,958
it turned into a free-for-all.

1069
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:47,207
And... every
major media outlet possible

1070
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,708
had a field day with it.

1071
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:51,040
Of course, they're doing
their job, but...

1072
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,873
now that they've gotten
to tell their story,

1073
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:55,250
now we get to let the bastard
stepchild of America...

1074
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:57,749
which is Baltimore City...
tell its story.

1075
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,040
We do not want to be known
as savages.

1076
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:01,623
We do not want to be known
as animals.

1077
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:03,206
We want to be known
as a community

1078
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:05,125
in which we just live
in the community.

1079
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:08,207
My proposal is
a nondenominational thing,

1080
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,041
and excuse my hands
being held behind my back,

1081
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,541
but I am extremely nervous,

1082
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:13,000
'cause I've never
actually done this.

1083
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:14,667
So...
- You're doing a good job.

1084
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,581
You can step forward
if you like, brother.

1085
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:18,750
- He needs a hug.

1086
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:21,249
- Yeah.

1087
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,249
- All right.
What I have planned

1088
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,582
is to have the various
elements of society...

1089
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:30,290
police, gang members, clergy,
Muslims, whoever...

1090
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:33,290
pray for our city...

1091
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,916
Together,

1092
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:37,208
regardless of the verdict.
- I'll disclose this...

1093
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:39,374
we'll probably have,
like, an hour notice.

1094
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:40,999
- Mm-hmm.
- Advanced.

1095
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,917
- Advanced notice.
That's a real small window.

1096
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:46,666
As soon as I get notice...
I'm hitting my man.

1097
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:48,916
- So you're saying
we would be on the ground...

1098
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:50,207
- Yes.

1099
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:51,583
- As the verdict is being
disclosed.

1100
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:53,332
- As the verdict is being read.

1101
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,373
- Ideally, before it comes out,
we're already out...

1102
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,832
- I got you.
- 'Cause we know it's coming.

1103
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,208
- Right.
- I would just like to say

1104
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,416
it's humbling,
it's encouraging,

1105
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:02,541
and I will be there
whenever you guys say

1106
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:04,000
we need to move.

1107
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,165
- There were
some eyebrows raised

1108
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,999
across the city
when word got out

1109
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,457
and some pictures surfaced
of outside police

1110
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:21,040
law enforcement agencies
assembling riot gear

1111
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:23,249
and things of that sort
at Druid Hill Park

1112
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,875
here in Baltimore.

1113
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:29,039
- You think they really
gonna turn up if he get off?

1114
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,917
Like, the whole city...
you think it's gonna be

1115
00:48:30,918 --> 00:48:35,124
like how it was last time...
if he get off?

1116
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:36,957
- I think it's gonna
be protest, yeah,

1117
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:38,709
but I don't think people
gonna burn shit down.

1118
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,833
- To be honest, I hope it's not
another riot,

1119
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,583
for real, like...

1120
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,999
I don't know, yo.

1121
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,332
- You know when
the verdict coming?

1122
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,792
The verdict.
You know when it's coming?

1123
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:55,333
I don't know.

1124
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:01,958
- No justice!
- No peace!

1125
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,499
- No racist...
- Police!

1126
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,165
- No justice!
- No peace!

1127
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:07,332
- No racist...
- Police!

1128
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:08,874
- Indict, convict!

1129
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,124
Send these killer cops to jail!

1130
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:15,124
The whole damn system
is guilty as hell!

1131
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,666
- We have just confirmed

1132
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,125
that a mistrial
has been declared

1133
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:19,874
in the case of Freddie Gray...

1134
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,834
the case against William Porter,
police officer...

1135
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:26,249
one of several police officers
accused of killing Freddie Gray.

1136
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,749
- Your reaction now

1137
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,581
to the judge's declaration
of a mistrial.

1138
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:31,750
- I mean, a mistrial, in short,
is a miscarriage of justice.

1139
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:34,165
- We need justice now,
not tomorrow.

1140
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,207
So we got to go through this
five more times?

1141
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,749
- This is exact...
this is the system working.

1142
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,708
It's not supposed to convict
one of its own.

1143
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:43,166
- The evidence was there.

1144
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,207
What more do you need to know?

1145
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:48,833
A man was killed
in police custody.

1146
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:50,499
- So what happens now?

1147
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,958
- We shut the city down.

1148
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:54,249
We continue to march
and demand for justice.

1149
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,039
We continue to make
our voices heard,

1150
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,583
and we continue
to let the world know

1151
00:49:57,584 --> 00:50:00,332
that Baltimore will be
the place where justice

1152
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,039
is served for the lives
of black people

1153
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,792
who were killed
in the presence of police.

1154
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,123
- I do think, ultimately,
we have to focus

1155
00:50:07,124 --> 00:50:08,750
on how to get the structural
changes necessary,

1156
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:10,916
so that way we can prevent
these types of trials

1157
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:12,792
from having to happen
in the first place.

1158
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,290
- Let's move away from them.
I think they're following me.

1159
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,667
- You are impeding...
- We do not have to disperse!

1160
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:22,207
- The flow of traffic...
- This is public property!

1161
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:25,916
Thugs with badges
is all y'all are!

1162
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:29,791
There are no riots.
We have not been violent.

1163
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:32,165
We are being peaceful.

1164
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:35,082
When did this become unlawful?

1165
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,415
- Come here, sir.
- What the...

1166
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:38,123
- Come here, come here.
Come here.

1167
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:39,583
Put your hands
behind your back.

1168
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:43,791
- What did I do?

1169
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,958
- He didn't do anything!

1170
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,916
- So, Kwame, what happened?

1171
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,999
- Excuse me.
- Sir, why did they arrest you?

1172
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,375
- I don't know.
- Step back!

1173
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:52,999
Step back, step back,
step back.

1174
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,582
- Get out the way!
Move!

1175
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,916
Free Kwame Rose!
Free Kwame Rose!

1176
00:50:57,917 --> 00:51:00,749
Free Kwame Rose!
Free Kwame Rose!

1177
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,082
Free Kwame Rose!

1178
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,291
- Impeding the flow
of vehicular

1179
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,874
and pedestrian traffic.

1180
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:10,541
- Fuck all y'all!

1181
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:13,582
- No, Mom, I'm protecting
my colleagues

1182
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:14,875
that are protesting.

1183
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:17,541
I'm not protesting.

1184
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,749
Yes, Mom.
I'm fine.

1185
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,166
I'm not gonna get arrested.
- All right.

1186
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,542
- I was standing over here,
and all of the sudden,

1187
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:28,540
you see a swarm
of the sheriff's deputies,

1188
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,417
and then they arrested him
in here.

1189
00:51:30,418 --> 00:51:33,332
That's why they're
standing out here.

1190
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,875
I'm gonna try to get
this gentleman's name, though,

1191
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:38,457
'cause...
he threatened me, so...

1192
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:41,249
What's your name?

1193
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,833
Could I have your name, please?

1194
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:45,250
What is your name?
You have to give me your name.

1195
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:47,250
You're a public servant.

1196
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,082
What is your name?

1197
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,833
Who is your ranking officer?

1198
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:56,667
Who's, like, the sergeant?
Who's the lieutenant?

1199
00:51:56,668 --> 00:51:59,457
Who's here?

1200
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:02,624
You don't know
who you fucking with.

1201
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,499
What's up, yo?

1202
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,416
You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

1203
00:52:06,417 --> 00:52:09,833
You know Kwame
got arrested, right?

1204
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:12,541
- Jason, are you still
representing Kwame?

1205
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:16,457
He just got arrested,
which is why I'm calling you.

1206
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,165
I wish I was kidding.

1207
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,708
- It's bad...
- Well...

1208
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:21,333
- 'Cause he was on probation.

1209
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:29,833
- And we are from one city
with what?

1210
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:31,207
One purpose!

1211
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,207
- One city...
- One purpose!

1212
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:35,374
- One city!
- One purpose!

1213
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,416
- Again, who knows
the serenity prayer?

1214
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,499
- I do!
I do!

1215
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,875
- That is the prayer we chose.

1216
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:42,332
However, if you have

1217
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,624
a private prayer
that you would like to say

1218
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,166
or you just so happen
to be Muslim

1219
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:47,749
and you want to make Salaat

1220
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,289
or you just so happen
to be Jewish and you want to...

1221
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,208
You know what I mean?
However that works.

1222
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,749
We got more people...
excuse me...

1223
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,416
on the news, saying that
the tensions are high.

1224
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:56,916
Does anybody here feel tense?

1225
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,916
- No!
- No!

1226
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:01,124
- Are we sure?
- Yes!

1227
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,959
- We're not gonna go looting,
like, tomorrow

1228
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,499
'cause of whatever, right?

1229
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,749
No!

1230
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,290
- Y'all hear me?
- Yes!

1231
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,916
- Loud, come on!
- Yeah!

1232
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:10,374
- God...

1233
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,749
Grant me the serenity

1234
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,416
to accept the things
I cannot change,

1235
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:17,082
the courage to change
the things that I can,

1236
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,499
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

1237
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,916
- Louder!

1238
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:22,916
God, grant me the serenity...

1239
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:24,541
- Hallelujah!

1240
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:26,458
- Thank You, Lord Jesus, God...
- Yes, God.

1241
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:28,165
Yes, God!
Hallelujah!

1242
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:29,998
- We're gonna let the devil
know that we... Guess what.

1243
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,417
We're gonna take
our streets back!

1244
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:32,958
- Amen?
- Amen!

1245
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,416
- Amen. And unity?
We're gonna have unity

1246
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:36,958
in Baltimore City. Amen?

1247
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:38,542
- We pray right now
in the name of Jesus,

1248
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:40,540
oh, God, that You
bring peace and love,

1249
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:42,373
oh, God, and kindness, oh, God,
in the name of Jesus.

1250
00:53:42,374 --> 00:53:44,125
- Lord God, go beyond
race and politics, oh, God.

1251
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:46,125
Lord God, we pray and ask
that You would go

1252
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:48,123
into the hearts of people,
oh, God,

1253
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,959
Lord God, and get at
the root of it, Lord God,

1254
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,000
the sin, Lord God.

1255
00:53:54,959 --> 00:53:56,958
- What God does
is indescribable.

1256
00:53:56,959 --> 00:53:58,999
There's not a drug on Earth

1257
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,542
that can get you higher
than Jesus.

1258
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:06,374
♪ All-powerful,
untamable ♪

1259
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,625
♪ Awestruck, we fall
to our knees ♪

1260
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,165
- Clergy, city leaders,

1261
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:20,000
and police officers stood
shoulder to shoulder

1262
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:22,082
with neighbors at Penn
and North Tuesday night,

1263
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,999
just steps from the CVS store

1264
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,999
that was looted and burned
during the unrest in April.

1265
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,082
They're linked
by a shared disappointment

1266
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:33,416
over what happened and a hope
that it won't happen again.

1267
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:35,083
- You a activist, this
is where you need to be at.

1268
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:36,833
This is real activism
right here.

1269
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:38,041
You know, it ain't just
about going out

1270
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,834
and marching every day.

1271
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:45,499
- Oh, yeah!

1272
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,040
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

1273
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:51,666
- Racist-ass cops!
- We don't need 'em!

1274
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:55,040
- Are y'all serious?
Y'all let this man walk

1275
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,374
into court with no shackles
on him?

1276
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,541
But when we get locked up,
y'all beat us up,

1277
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:02,541
tighten the cuffs
off our wrists.

1278
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:04,374
Do you know how
that shit feels?

1279
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:07,874
That is not a pretty...
it ain't nothing...

1280
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,290
nothing... this city
doesn't have nothing.

1281
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:12,082
We don't have nothing to do.

1282
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,416
I'm 17, smoking cigarettes.

1283
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:17,207
Why? Because I'm stressed every
day that I'm going to die.

1284
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,916
It's either I'm scared that
I'm gonna die by a stray bullet

1285
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:22,749
or a cop-killer like Porter.

1286
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,541
- Tell me what democracy
looks like!

1287
00:55:25,542 --> 00:55:27,458
This is what
democracy looks like!

1288
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:30,040
- Tell me what
democracy looks like!

1289
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,290
This is what
democracy looks like!

1290
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,708
- Tell me what
democracy looks like!

1291
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:37,416
This is what
democracy looks like!

1292
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,958
- I generally get frustrated
with the way that people get

1293
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:42,749
sucked into the theater
of the actual trial.

1294
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,916
The trial kind of represents

1295
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:48,958
the little bit of justice
that people want.

1296
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:50,500
It's really the least amount
of justice

1297
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:54,332
that one could ask for.

1298
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:58,165
But the biggest deterrent
to abuse is power, you know?

1299
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:00,666
If an officer knows that
they will get sent to jail

1300
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,582
or have some severe
consequences,

1301
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:04,165
or if the department
knows that,

1302
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:07,500
they're gonna behave
differently.

1303
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:11,875
Unfortunately,
people miss the point

1304
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:14,582
of the importance of studying
our condition, our people...

1305
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,457
that the purpose is to take

1306
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,124
what our folks have discovered
and learned about ourselves

1307
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:23,290
and our condition
and take it a step further.

1308
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,958
Leaders
of a Beautiful Struggle...

1309
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:27,708
we call it LBS for short...
was founded in 2010.

1310
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:29,290
Many of us are former
high-school

1311
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:30,791
and college policy debaters.

1312
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:32,500
So we wanted
to form an organization

1313
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:36,124
that was the public policy
arm of the community.

1314
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,582
- The strength and power
of the organizing work

1315
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:41,499
that we do is that we're always
thinking about the future

1316
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,374
and passing it on
to young folks.

1317
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:46,499
So people like Kwame
and Makayla are emboldened

1318
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,249
to achieve what
they can achieve

1319
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,164
and to do what they do
because we decided

1320
00:56:50,165 --> 00:56:52,206
to pass that kind of knowledge
and passion on to them.

1321
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:54,581
And so it's our view that
that's what we need to do

1322
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:56,291
to empower black people
in this city...

1323
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:59,833
to pass on knowledge,
wisdom, and skills

1324
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,999
that can take them
into the future.

1325
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,040
- So what we're trying to do
is reform what's called

1326
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:07,332
the "Law Enforcement Officer
Bill of Rights,"

1327
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,916
and that was codified
back in 1974.

1328
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:13,749
Basically, what it does is that
it gives police officers

1329
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,040
in Maryland protections
above and beyond

1330
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,708
their constitutional rights.

1331
00:57:17,709 --> 00:57:19,708
Give you a couple of examples.

1332
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:22,582
So let's say a police officer
has been alleged

1333
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:24,166
to have engaged
in excessive force...

1334
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,124
so they fatally
beat somebody up.

1335
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:29,124
There's a trial board
that determines

1336
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:32,165
whether they get fired or not,
whether they get suspended.

1337
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:35,833
That trial board is made up
of other police officers.

1338
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:37,666
Right?
So one of the elements

1339
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,249
we would try to change is to

1340
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,166
make it so that
a non-police officer

1341
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,708
is on that trial board.

1342
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:46,374
If someone's investigating
that incident,

1343
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:49,457
only sworn law enforcement
can interrogate

1344
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:51,290
that police officer.

1345
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:54,958
Our opposition is the FOP...
the Fraternal Order of Police...

1346
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:57,833
the union that represents
and supports the police.

1347
00:57:57,834 --> 00:58:01,040
And to the FOP,
all these amendments

1348
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:04,000
are nonstarters.

1349
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,333
- How do you feel
about the climate

1350
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:12,999
of Baltimore right now?

1351
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,667
- I feel like everybody's
holding their breath

1352
00:58:14,668 --> 00:58:17,082
and has been
since the trial started.

1353
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:20,290
It didn't end in a cathartic
moment that we needed.

1354
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,500
A mistrial... we don't know
what to do

1355
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,374
with that, emotionally.

1356
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,874
Can I read you my essay now?
Does that work?

1357
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,709
- Yeah, you can read
while I'm decorating.

1358
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,082
So the question is,
"Discuss an accomplishment

1359
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:35,874
"or event, formal or informal,
that marked your transition

1360
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:37,750
"from childhood to adulthood
within your culture,

1361
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:39,332
community, or family."

1362
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,665
"With each of my first breaths
on this Earth,

1363
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,041
"I was deluded of my innocence

1364
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:43,541
"and the purity
of my childhood.

1365
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:44,957
"Even despite my mother's
strenuous effort

1366
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,208
"to protect my sisters and me

1367
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:47,708
"from the cruelty around us...

1368
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:48,957
"despite the strength
and resilience

1369
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,415
"that we inherited from her,

1370
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:51,581
despite the beautiful
memories"...

1371
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:52,998
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1372
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:54,250
This essay sounds like
you were...

1373
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,916
- Can I just get through the...

1374
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,498
You didn't even listen
to the rest of the essay.

1375
00:58:57,499 --> 00:58:59,206
- Can I finish speaking?
- Oh, my God.

1376
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:00,540
- It sounds like you were...
you have been fighting

1377
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,665
all your life...
- Mom.

1378
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,081
- Makayla, it sounds like

1379
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:04,707
you have been fighting
all your life,

1380
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,250
like you were born
into this struggle,

1381
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,791
and you didn't have
a childhood...

1382
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:09,541
- Can you listen
to the sentence?

1383
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:12,082
- No, you had... you had
a very, very good childhood.

1384
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,917
- Mom, you didn't listen
to the rest of the sentence.

1385
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,624
- You were sheltered... okay.

1386
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,625
- "Despite her success
in creating a facade of safety

1387
00:59:17,626 --> 00:59:19,374
for us"...
- "Facade of safety"?

1388
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:21,833
Really? "Facade of safety"?
- Yes, Mom...

1389
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:23,415
- Well, okay,
you're talking... okay.

1390
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:24,790
- Can you let me finish
the sentence?

1391
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,290
- Go ahead.
- Oh, my God.

1392
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:28,039
"Despite the strength
and resilience

1393
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,417
"that we inherited from her,
despite the beautiful

1394
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:30,915
"memories she crafted for us,

1395
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:32,166
"there remain
the unflinching reminders

1396
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:34,499
of our bodies' fungibility."

1397
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,207
- It's a very well written
essay.

1398
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:38,457
- But...
- It sounds like you were born

1399
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,749
into this struggle,

1400
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,416
you didn't have
a good childhood,

1401
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:44,124
you didn't live.

1402
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,833
I don't like the tone of it,
because it just doesn't...

1403
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,040
it's not... it's not
your reality.

1404
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,541
And I think...

1405
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:52,166
I mean, you and I...
this has not been

1406
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:54,541
a good year for us at all.

1407
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,000
You can roll your eyes
all you want.

1408
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:57,498
- I didn't roll my eyes.

1409
00:59:57,499 --> 00:59:59,125
- It has not been
a good year for us at all,

1410
00:59:59,126 --> 01:00:01,749
'cause I grow increasingly
more frustrated

1411
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,500
with you, and you grow
just as frustrated with me.

1412
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:19,874
- I think there are ways
that protest can become

1413
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:22,207
counterproductive
when there are not

1414
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:25,999
specific policy items
that are at play.

1415
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,123
And it's really important that,

1416
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,375
if that's the case,

1417
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:29,875
that people are being conscious

1418
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,624
about the time and energy
and cost.

1419
01:00:32,625 --> 01:00:35,541
- So we're gonna take...

1420
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:37,666
I think it's about
15 neighborhoods.

1421
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,375
- In my opinion,
it would be smarter

1422
01:00:39,376 --> 01:00:41,875
just to have everybody down
in, like, the Inner Harbor.

1423
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:44,708
- They will lock up people
who are disrupting

1424
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:48,916
white folks'
commercial activity...

1425
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:52,416
especially on New Year's Eve.

1426
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:54,041
- The police ain't gonna...
the police ain't

1427
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:56,416
just gonna attack people
on New Year's Eve.

1428
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:59,541
- You don't think the police
are going to attack people.

1429
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:02,666
Stop there.

1430
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,540
- That's not what I meant.
So if they see positive...

1431
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:05,957
- And you're giving
them more reason...

1432
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,581
- No, but if they see
positive people,

1433
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:08,959
then they're gonna stand up.
- "Positive"?

1434
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,374
- What's positive?

1435
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,123
Black Lives Matter
isn't positive.

1436
01:01:12,124 --> 01:01:14,039
Marching with your fist
isn't positive to them.

1437
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,750
- It is positive to me.
- To them, it's not positive.

1438
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:17,958
- But the young people...
- So Kwame is on his

1439
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:19,416
Part II'"...

1440
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:21,833
- No, no, I don't want...
I'm talking about

1441
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:23,833
going in more like,
"Yo, like, come, like,

1442
01:01:23,834 --> 01:01:25,750
do this with us."
- My thing is the police

1443
01:01:25,751 --> 01:01:28,040
are already tripping,
so if you go down there

1444
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:30,749
on some Black Lives Matter...
you know, whatever, whatever,

1445
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,498
you're marching
in the streets... they're gonna

1446
01:01:32,499 --> 01:01:34,373
be doubly tripping,
and whoever else is caught

1447
01:01:34,374 --> 01:01:36,208
in the crossfire, if they...
if they, like, halfway...

1448
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:37,833
"Hell, yeah,
Black Lives Matter,"

1449
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:39,375
and, like, throw some shit
at the police,

1450
01:01:39,376 --> 01:01:40,999
then you're
responsible for them.

1451
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,456
And then you got to worry
about their safety...

1452
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:44,417
- And then they say
it incited a riot.

1453
01:01:44,418 --> 01:01:45,999
- I ain't getting arrested.

1454
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,790
- If you're marching,
you're getting arrested.

1455
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,415
- I don't think you realize
that you got arrested

1456
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:51,250
for telling people
to stay on the sidewalk.

1457
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:53,124
I'm just saying...

1458
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,999
you're gonna be responsible
for that whole thing.

1459
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,958
- Next.
- Look it... God, okay.

1460
01:01:57,959 --> 01:01:59,416
- Next.
- Next!

1461
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:01,457
- So back to what
we were doing previously.

1462
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,291
- So also, like, I'm saying
when the ball drops,

1463
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,457
we want to have, like,
three to four people

1464
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,958
actually down there,
throwing the leaflets up.

1465
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:10,124
- And then the pamphlets
will simultaneously

1466
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,124
being released in Harbor East,

1467
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,083
in Fell's Point, Let cetera.
- Right.

1468
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:15,624
- If you're gonna do it, do it,

1469
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,915
but don't worry about our people
seeing the shit.

1470
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:19,331
You need to hit the core,

1471
01:02:19,332 --> 01:02:21,208
where all the white people
gonna be at.

1472
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:23,999
- We're not doing anything
that is hurting us

1473
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,165
by attempting
to educate our own people.

1474
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,625
- I was just saying that it was
a waste of time.

1475
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:29,125
A lot of people
in the community,

1476
01:02:29,126 --> 01:02:30,708
they're not gonna give a fuck.

1477
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:32,250
As soon as they hear
"Black Lives Matter,"

1478
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:34,165
they're not gonna care.

1479
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:35,957
All these different movements,
and Gilmor is still fucked up.

1480
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,875
They don't care about
none of that Black Lives Matter

1481
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:39,290
or none of that.

1482
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,500
People have to believe,
and the thing is,

1483
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:42,542
nobody in Baltimore believes.

1484
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:59,666
- So tonight our crew
is going around the city

1485
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:03,917
setting up, like, hood vigils
in predominantly white areas.

1486
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:13,332
I have at least some idea
what it means

1487
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:15,165
when we say
"black lives matter"

1488
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,625
because I know
what black death feels like.

1489
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,874
Like, I had a bracket
of, like, six months

1490
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,083
where it was like every day,
I was trying to figure out

1491
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:30,458
a different way to kill myself.

1492
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,499
At the time, when, like,
my anxiety and depression

1493
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,375
started to, like,
manifest itself,

1494
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:40,708
I wasn't an organizer,
I was just an advocate,

1495
01:03:40,709 --> 01:03:43,249
not even an activist.

1496
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,625
I started to feel like,
"Well, maybe I'm not worth it.

1497
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:47,375
What change
can I really make?"

1498
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:52,040
And so...

1499
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:54,666
I sat in a room,
and I was crying hysterically,

1500
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,374
and I had all of these pills,

1501
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:59,040
which I had been
carrying around with me

1502
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,582
for a few weeks by then.

1503
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:04,792
I knew that it wasn't
going to be an immediate death

1504
01:04:04,793 --> 01:04:07,874
by any means, but it's like,
"As long as I die,

1505
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,499
"because I can't do anything

1506
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,250
with this life
that I've been given."

1507
01:04:12,959 --> 01:04:15,749
I now know my importance,
and I now know my worth.

1508
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,875
And so, like, that's why
this movement has taken on

1509
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:20,667
so much more meaning for me.

1510
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:30,417
- Happy, happy New Year!

1511
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,040
[]

1512
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,457
- Here.

1513
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,541
Can you pass this down
to my friend?

1514
01:04:42,542 --> 01:04:44,458
Thank you.

1515
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:51,749
People are like, "Ooh,
ah, fuck black lives,

1516
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,291
there are fireworks."

1517
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:02,332
- Take that down.
- What law is it against?

1518
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:05,332
- I'm just telling you,
you have to take it down.

1519
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:07,500
- No, no, you can't...
you can't, like, take shit.

1520
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:09,082
- If you don't calm down,

1521
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,540
you can be locked up
for disorderly conduct.

1522
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:12,206
- They told us to take
the banner down.

1523
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:14,625
- Is that not disorderly
conduct... you taking my shit?

1524
01:05:14,626 --> 01:05:17,416
Give me the law
that I'm breaking

1525
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:18,791
by holding a banner.

1526
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:21,332
- Okay.

1527
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,790
I don't have an answer,
but you can't put that up there.

1528
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:25,166
I will have an answer for you.

1529
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,000
- Okay, y'all have a nice day.

1530
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:43,958
- Started from the bottom,
now we here.

1531
01:05:43,959 --> 01:05:46,208
Baltimore, what's up?

1532
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:55,457
- I'm not a organizer.

1533
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,333
I wasn't a protestor
before any of this happened.

1534
01:05:57,334 --> 01:05:59,040
I'm learning as I go.

1535
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:00,541
So, you know,
I went from making

1536
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:03,207
minimum $50,000, $60,000 a year

1537
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:05,874
to, like, now being dead broke.

1538
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,542
And I'm still out here
trying to front,

1539
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:09,165
to be the face of the people,

1540
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,750
like, "No, I'm good.
I'm all good."

1541
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:12,791
And, yo... and people
on the street, yo,

1542
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:14,206
it ain't no people
out there willing

1543
01:06:14,207 --> 01:06:16,039
to get... I done
been arrested twice,

1544
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,707
and that's more times...
- All right.

1545
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,667
So, at the end of the day, yo,
everybody know

1546
01:06:19,668 --> 01:06:22,457
what Kwame stand for,
so why get locked up anymore,

1547
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,373
if people
not gonna ride with you?

1548
01:06:24,374 --> 01:06:26,248
- But this last time, though...
- Let me tell you something.

1549
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:27,875
- I didn't do nothing.
- Let me tell you something,

1550
01:06:27,876 --> 01:06:30,249
as a mother... and-and
'cause I'm his mother.

1551
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:33,791
My concern for you is
that you're 21.

1552
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:36,708
You got a whole lot
of living to do.

1553
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:39,332
- Right.
- Whoever you praise...

1554
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:40,999
God be willing.

1555
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,124
You got a whole lot to live.
Don't ruin your future

1556
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:47,749
with that bullshit,
keep getting locked up.

1557
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,791
I know what
you're trying to do,

1558
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,250
but I want you to be smart.

1559
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,916
Not just for Baltimore,

1560
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:55,083
but for Kwame.

1561
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:12,082
- In the last few
hours of 2015,

1562
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:15,416
Baltimore's homicide rate
climbed to 344.

1563
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:17,624
- Baltimore's murder rate
is the highest

1564
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:19,499
per capita
in the city's history,

1565
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,917
and the past few days have
been very bloody.

1566
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,458
- So we got another shooting
we're working on the east side.

1567
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:35,124
You know, for the third time
in my career,

1568
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:39,624
I find myself leading
a police department

1569
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,040
through a crisis.

1570
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:43,290
It's a crisis of unrest

1571
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:48,708
and community trust
and violence.

1572
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:51,124
- How far is the scene?

1573
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,708
- Right where the squad car is.

1574
01:07:52,709 --> 01:07:54,289
- All right, I'll go around.
- Hey, Sarge.

1575
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,125
- Okay, I'll walk...
I'll drive around, then.

1576
01:07:56,126 --> 01:07:57,666
- Be careful.
All right.

1577
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:01,624
- Be careful of what?
We're the police.

1578
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:05,457
- The unfettered access
to guns in America

1579
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:07,541
is one of the curses
of this country.

1580
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,290
This country was
a much different place

1581
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:13,582
when the Second Amendment
was introduced.

1582
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,542
- Blood trail goes down
the street.

1583
01:08:15,543 --> 01:08:17,165
The victim was found facedown.

1584
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:19,000
Looks like he was shot
in the back and the head.

1585
01:08:19,001 --> 01:08:21,750
No cameras... that work.

1586
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:26,207
At the end of the day,
it's someone's son,

1587
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,707
someone's daughter,
someone's mother,

1588
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,291
brother, sister
who's been killed,

1589
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:30,833
so this ripple goes out,

1590
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:32,582
and then if we make an arrest,

1591
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,708
that suspect...
his family's affected by it.

1592
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:36,667
People who live
in the neighborhood

1593
01:08:36,668 --> 01:08:38,958
are affected by it,
obviously, so...

1594
01:08:38,959 --> 01:08:41,708
it's just
that never-ending cycle that...

1595
01:08:41,709 --> 01:08:44,500
I don't know what you do,
but something's got to be done.

1596
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:54,582
- Here, let me do this.
We're numbered.

1597
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:57,207
- This must be that graze wound
they were talking about,

1598
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:59,332
- On the arm?
- On the arm.

1599
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:03,708
- Well, we have so many
murders from last year.

1600
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:07,749
It's just been a nightmare
dealing with it all.

1601
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,374
So you're basically
sitting here,

1602
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:11,625
waiting for the body to drop.

1603
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,124
- Well, a second trial
in the death of Freddie Gray

1604
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,291
is set to begin this week.

1605
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,457
Edward Nero,

1606
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:20,834
unlike Officer William Porter,

1607
01:09:20,835 --> 01:09:24,374
is charged with misdemeanors.

1608
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:26,124
- There's also a new push

1609
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:28,207
for more police accountability
in Maryland.

1610
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:30,083
- Yeah, the police
accountability bill is making

1611
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:32,916
its way through both chambers
in the Capitol.

1612
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:34,541
- There are some elements

1613
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:36,041
in that police
accountability bill

1614
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:37,749
that both sides have agreed on,

1615
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,499
but there's been no agreement

1616
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,791
on that civilian
to trial board proposal.

1617
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:46,249
- When we first started
our work

1618
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,709
around the Law Enforcement
Officers' Bill of Rights,

1619
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,416
one of the central parts of it

1620
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:52,499
that we felt was most
important to change

1621
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,040
is civilian participation
on the trial boards.

1622
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,834
These are the boards
that determine discipline

1623
01:09:56,835 --> 01:09:59,708
for police officers accused
of wrongdoing,

1624
01:09:59,709 --> 01:10:01,708
because before that,
it was exclusively

1625
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:04,417
law enforcement that served
on those boards.

1626
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,959
I think our success is that
we've been able

1627
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,958
to drive the conversation
so that this issue

1628
01:10:10,959 --> 01:10:12,749
of civilians on the trial board

1629
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,290
became such a central issue.

1630
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:18,624
- We would not be here today
if it were not

1631
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,958
for the brothers and sisters
in Baltimore

1632
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:24,457
who rose up in
an insurrectionary mode

1633
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:26,624
to challenge
the police department there.

1634
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:31,249
That uprising is what finally
got them to consider

1635
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,333
that maybe we should do
some legislative initiatives.

1636
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,916
- I got to disagree
with the transparency point.

1637
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:40,582
I mean, I don't think
that giving

1638
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,833
a law enforcement officer
ten days

1639
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:45,833
to get their story together,
to gather information,

1640
01:10:45,834 --> 01:10:48,290
to gather facts is transparent.

1641
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:50,166
- If he was committed...
if he committed a crime,

1642
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:53,416
he could sit back and say,
"I'm not saying anything."

1643
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,081
- But the officer
has the same right

1644
01:10:55,082 --> 01:10:56,498
because he has
a Fifth Amendment right,

1645
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:58,208
and if he says no,
he then can say,

1646
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:00,916
"Hey, I want a lawyer,"
just like this citizen.

1647
01:11:00,917 --> 01:11:02,332
But the difference is,

1648
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:04,039
this citizen is not going
to walk out...

1649
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,709
If you think
you have probable cause,

1650
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,165
he's not gonna walk out
this police station.

1651
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,915
The officer is.
- Yeah, well, you...

1652
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:11,456
- That's the difference.
- Now, the thing about it is,

1653
01:11:11,457 --> 01:11:12,873
that's an extremely
broad stroke again,

1654
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:14,540
because you're talking
about all cases

1655
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:16,206
where an officer may have
been accused of something.

1656
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:17,498
- So we... I'm a retired
homicide detective.

1657
01:11:17,499 --> 01:11:18,875
- Yeah... right, yeah, yeah.

1658
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:21,999
- You can't run games
around me.

1659
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,374
- Law Enforcement Officers'
Bill of Rights, in this state,

1660
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,332
protects officers
when they fail to protect us,

1661
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:31,708
creating barriers to gaining
access to information,

1662
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:33,499
prohibiting interrogation.

1663
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,792
Even if somebody's blood

1664
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:36,541
has been painted
on the pavement,

1665
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,916
the officer caught red-handed
cannot be demanded

1666
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:42,457
to make a statement
for ten whole days.

1667
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:47,000
God created the heavens
and the Earth in less.

1668
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,582
- There is no problem
that the LEOBR works,

1669
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:56,708
has worked, continues to work.

1670
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:58,958
Uh, and...

1671
01:11:58,959 --> 01:12:01,082
we feel remiss
to be here today.

1672
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:05,332
- I was a bit taken aback
by your initial comment.

1673
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,499
I don't know what
the problem is, exactly,

1674
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,916
but it's very clear, I think,
to virtually everybody,

1675
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:13,999
there is a problem.

1676
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,416
- I've heard very clearly
from my constituents.

1677
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,708
They feel that officers
are playing

1678
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:21,250
by a different set of rules.

1679
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,332
- We know that
we can't honestly

1680
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,999
have community policing

1681
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,499
if we don't have
community members

1682
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,250
have-have an ability
to be engaged

1683
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:36,833
in the process at every level.

1684
01:12:36,834 --> 01:12:38,542
- You know, I think
a lot of the conversation

1685
01:12:38,543 --> 01:12:40,833
has been around
community-police relations.

1686
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:42,873
And I think this framework
is a problematic framework

1687
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:44,790
in thinking about
what the issue is,

1688
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,290
because we're not talking about
community-police relations.

1689
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:50,207
We're talking about the ability
for civilians to-to work

1690
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:52,416
collaboratively,
on an equal playing field,

1691
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:54,289
in the industry
of law enforcement.

1692
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,164
And citizens have a right
to be able to have

1693
01:12:56,165 --> 01:12:57,957
substantive say
in the nature of how

1694
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,333
law enforcement's administered
in their communities.

1695
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,624
- We don't need that.

1696
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:08,124
- We're opposed to citizens
judging police officers

1697
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,249
in ba... on a basis
of misconduct.

1698
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,999
Understanding the law
is not the issue.

1699
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,583
It's understanding the job.

1700
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:33,290
- What happened, cuzzo?
- Uh, a car had, um...

1701
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:36,750
a car sped the van,
a nigga jumped out, shot it up.

1702
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:50,999
- Melvin Russell is the first
and only cop

1703
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,666
I have ever trusted.

1704
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:54,333
He asked me if
I could do anything

1705
01:13:54,334 --> 01:13:56,249
to help him
with the murder rate.

1706
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,709
I'm like, "I can't do the
police's job for them,

1707
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:59,290
"but what I can do is keep

1708
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:00,625
"the people who
haven't done anything

1709
01:14:00,626 --> 01:14:02,123
out of the line of fire."

1710
01:14:02,124 --> 01:14:03,206
- Okay, got it.

1711
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:04,665
Belmont and Bloomingdale.

1712
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:06,331
- All right.
- You know, that crew?

1713
01:14:06,332 --> 01:14:07,875
Here, take it with you.
Just don't let anybody...

1714
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:11,124
Just put it in your pocket.
- Uh-huh.

1715
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:12,999
- Hey, cuzzo!

1716
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,416
If I can get the police
to lay off of my boys...

1717
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:19,332
all of them... and get
these dudes to, um...

1718
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,541
put their guns down.
The murder rate goes down,

1719
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:26,040
more jobs are created.
A lot of things happen.

1720
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,000
- So good afternoon, family.
Let me just say this:

1721
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:30,040
I am very excited about
this component

1722
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,708
of what we do in the Community
Collaboration Division, right?

1723
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:35,290
And that is being the bridge

1724
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:37,332
between the ex-offender

1725
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,249
and the jobs
that are out there.

1726
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,791
And so our next stop is
in West Baltimore,

1727
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:43,582
and we're gonna set up shop

1728
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,542
in that Sandtown-Winchester,
Gilmor community.

1729
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,916
- One city.
- One purpose.

1730
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:55,708
- One city!
- One purpose!

1731
01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:59,082
One purpose.

1732
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:01,248
We're starting a job program
around the neighborhood

1733
01:15:01,249 --> 01:15:02,500
for convicted felons,

1734
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:04,708
at-risk youth, gang-affiliated,

1735
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,665
just got out of jail...
all of that.

1736
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:07,750
- Okay.
- We're trying to plug

1737
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:09,165
dudes back in,

1738
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:10,707
but whoever you see
in the program

1739
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,415
that's interested in going...
remember, felons...

1740
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,415
mostly the felons, people
trying to get some work...

1741
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:15,917
- Oh, you know I got
five of those.

1742
01:15:15,918 --> 01:15:18,749
- Yeah, so you know
who I'm talking about.

1743
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,874
Contrary to popular belief,
man, like,

1744
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,624
I get off of work at 4:00.

1745
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,166
Me and the brother be out
doing this

1746
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:26,791
till, like, 11:30, 12:00
at night sometimes,

1747
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:28,874
on a daily basis.
- We do this on the daily!

1748
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:31,582
- A lot of people
think this is my actual job,

1749
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:34,916
so...

1750
01:15:34,917 --> 01:15:37,165
- This is not a game.
This is not for anybody

1751
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:40,708
trying to try another system
and still have one foot

1752
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:43,082
out there and one foot in here.

1753
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:45,124
This is for those
that are serious.

1754
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,792
- You're going to be trained
at something

1755
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:49,207
that most people have to
go to school

1756
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,082
five and six years for,

1757
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:54,917
'cause nobody... outside of us...
believes in us.

1758
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,958
- Decisive "not guilty" verdict

1759
01:16:00,959 --> 01:16:04,124
in the high-profile trial
of Officer Edward Nero.

1760
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,332
Tonight, Officer Nero is
a free man,

1761
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,874
after a judge cleared him
of all charges

1762
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:10,583
in the arrest
and subsequent death

1763
01:16:10,584 --> 01:16:12,124
of Freddie Gray.

1764
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,875
- The judge wouldn't even
convict him

1765
01:16:13,876 --> 01:16:16,124
on misdemeanor charges.

1766
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,541
And I felt as though

1767
01:16:17,542 --> 01:16:19,582
he's not gonna convict them
anyway,

1768
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:23,124
because he's one of them.

1769
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,624
- There are
a lot of people here

1770
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:26,791
on the streets
that are quite upset

1771
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:29,582
with this acquittal...
quite upset that, as of now,

1772
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:32,666
nobody has been punished
for the death of Freddie Gray.

1773
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:34,333
- Motherfuckers want to gather
around here because

1774
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:36,249
a man was found
not guilty, man.

1775
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,833
Get the fuck out of here, man.
- There's a whole city

1776
01:16:38,834 --> 01:16:40,748
full of fucking shit
going on right now,

1777
01:16:40,749 --> 01:16:42,291
and y'all on this corner?
- Right!

1778
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:44,289
- Somebody getting killed,
ran the fuck over...

1779
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,581
that's where the news at.

1780
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:47,000
Ain't shit happening over here.

1781
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:48,958
There's nothing happening here.

1782
01:16:48,959 --> 01:16:50,623
As long as y'all here
in this capacity,

1783
01:16:50,624 --> 01:16:52,500
you are bringing
the wrong kind of attention.

1784
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:54,374
That's my job.
You're welcome.

1785
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,875
- I'm showing you
that it's not over.

1786
01:16:55,876 --> 01:16:57,874
It's a simple...

1787
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:00,541
No justice, no peace!

1788
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:02,708
Jail killer police!

1789
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:05,332
No justice, no peace!

1790
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,374
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

1791
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,374
- Whose city?
- Our city!

1792
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,541
- Whose city?
- Our city!

1793
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:14,332
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

1794
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,582
- The protest makes an impact
in the community,

1795
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:19,666
but there are no... I feel like
there's no concrete strategy

1796
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:22,040
attached to it.
Like, the visual is there.

1797
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,958
People are being engaged
in a political process,

1798
01:17:24,959 --> 01:17:26,542
but that political process
isn't being used

1799
01:17:26,543 --> 01:17:28,666
to anything greater than
just this:

1800
01:17:28,667 --> 01:17:30,332
People standing on a corner.

1801
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,874
- Like, this type of
environment is what, like...

1802
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:35,039
like, it lets a lot of people
know that that's not right,

1803
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,500
'cause people are just numb
to it, so they don't...

1804
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:39,708
- No, it does something.
I'm just saying

1805
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:41,874
it's not
the most productive option.

1806
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,625
This protest is gonna happen,
it's gonna disperse,

1807
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:45,208
and that's gonna be it.

1808
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:51,040
The work is so hard
because a lot of people expect

1809
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:54,124
all of these organizers to
be the heroes and the leaders

1810
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:56,000
who are going to lead us
out of this, right?

1811
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:59,040
And it's like, we need to
be shutting that narrative down

1812
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,124
as well, because it's like...

1813
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:04,582
that whole leadership complex
is both really troubling

1814
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,708
for the person who is told
that they need to

1815
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:09,083
be the leader, but it's also
troubling for the community,

1816
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:11,416
because it places
all of the responsibility

1817
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:12,750
on one person,
when it needs to be

1818
01:18:12,751 --> 01:18:14,499
the collective effort.

1819
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,249
Activism, as a young person,

1820
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,916
has just been so draining
for me.

1821
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:19,791
Um... and so, just, like,

1822
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:21,874
my whole being needs healing

1823
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:24,458
and I just need
a break, really.

1824
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:42,248
- What's the format
of the meeting?

1825
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:43,417
Are we eating and then talking?

1826
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,040
- Something like that.

1827
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:47,583
- Come and eat.

1828
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,958
- So, Makayla,
you called the family meeting.

1829
01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:55,791
- Mm-hmm.
- Do tell.

1830
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,625
- Okay, so, like,
I've been thinking

1831
01:18:57,626 --> 01:19:03,124
that I want to take a gap year
after I graduate.

1832
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:05,082
Period.
- No.

1833
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,582
- No.

1834
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:09,416
Well, that's the end

1835
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:11,541
of the meeting.

1836
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:14,040
- You have been so busy
that you can't even

1837
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:17,749
get it together.
I think what our concern is,

1838
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:21,999
one gap year may end up
being ten gap years.

1839
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,916
- I-I feel a bit conflicted,

1840
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:27,332
because it's not what
I had planned for you.

1841
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:28,999
- Mm-hmm.
- But more importantly,

1842
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,500
it's not what I thought
you had planned for you.

1843
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:33,040
- Right.
- The gap year...

1844
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,708
can be productive, or it can
be destructive,

1845
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:37,916
depending on how
you utilize your time,

1846
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:39,540
because if you're going
to utilize your time

1847
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,375
doing everything
for everybody but Makayla...

1848
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:44,999
- But, like, I'm going to make
my checkpoints known

1849
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,959
to the people in this room,
and so,

1850
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,165
a part of this meeting
is, like...

1851
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:51,666
me asking that you all
serve as, like,

1852
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:53,166
the people who will hold me
accountable to that.

1853
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:55,582
- If you feel honest
within yourself

1854
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:58,582
that you're taking
this year off to actually

1855
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:01,374
do stuff to get better
within yourself...

1856
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,708
- Mm-hmm.
- Then I'm all for it.

1857
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:05,250
- 'Cause you're gonna do
what you want to do anyway,

1858
01:20:05,251 --> 01:20:07,290
so, God bless you.

1859
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:09,499
I knew you had skills

1860
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,542
when you called the police
on your mother.

1861
01:20:13,667 --> 01:20:16,958
- Let's see... she was about
two or three.

1862
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:19,457
I went downstairs,
and she was upstairs,

1863
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:21,833
watching television,
and the phone rang,

1864
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:23,373
and I answered it.
And I said, "Hello?"

1865
01:20:23,374 --> 01:20:24,873
And they said,
"Did someone call 911?"

1866
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:26,291
I said no.
So I went upstairs,

1867
01:20:26,292 --> 01:20:28,833
and I said,
"Did you use the phone?"

1868
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:29,875
She said, "Yes, ma'am."

1869
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:32,958
I said, "Who did you call?"

1870
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:34,583
She said, "You said
if someone hurt me,

1871
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:36,708
to call 911"...

1872
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:38,541
She said...

1873
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,875
she said, "You hurt me when
you were combing my hair"...

1874
01:20:40,876 --> 01:20:43,582
"So I called 911."

1875
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:45,916
Three years old,
I should have known

1876
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:48,958
there would be hell to pay,
raising this girl.

1877
01:20:48,959 --> 01:20:50,582
- Look, justice is justice.

1878
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:53,375
- No justice, no peace.

1879
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:57,125
"So I called 911."

1880
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,791
- It's weird... you know,
this is my first trial.

1881
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:13,833
Wish that, uh...

1882
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:17,374
my family was, like,
more supportive.

1883
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,958
So I contacted the ACLU,
'cause I didn't have the money

1884
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,709
to pay for my own
private attorney this time.

1885
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:42,041
Not a good judge to go for...

1886
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:47,625
Which is why I, like,
started freaking out,

1887
01:21:47,626 --> 01:21:50,791
came outside to smoke
a cigarette.

1888
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:52,874
The entire time
we had this trial,

1889
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:54,249
no group paid my bills.

1890
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:55,916
No group paid my bail funds.

1891
01:21:55,917 --> 01:21:57,959
No group helped me out...
no activist group.

1892
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:06,000
All right, wish me luck.
- Good luck, brother.

1893
01:22:22,667 --> 01:22:25,541
- So, you guys have heard, uh,
the-the verdict.

1894
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:28,082
The judge found our client,
Mr. Rosebrough,

1895
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,791
not guilty of three counts
and guilty of one count.

1896
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:34,124
We totally disagree
with the court's decision

1897
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:35,792
that he is guilty of anything.

1898
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:46,164
- Well, the trial
for one of the six officers

1899
01:22:46,165 --> 01:22:48,125
involved in the arrest
of Freddie Gray

1900
01:22:48,126 --> 01:22:49,749
starts today in Baltimore.

1901
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,582
- Officer Caesar Goodson faces

1902
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,333
second-degree
depraved-heart murder charges

1903
01:22:53,334 --> 01:22:56,375
and several others.

1904
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:03,332
- It's hard to feel like
a woman in this, um...

1905
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:07,040
in this job sometimes.

1906
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:10,792
Especially trying
to be beautiful at all.

1907
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:15,124
You try to take your emotions
out of a case,

1908
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,374
but it's impossible.

1909
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:19,708
I'm always nervous
going into a trial.

1910
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:24,582
Um... testimony is one of
the most stressful times

1911
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,749
in your career,
because everything,

1912
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,165
at that point, falls on you.

1913
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:31,541
I don't want you
to be worried about what...

1914
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:33,249
what other people
are gonna say,

1915
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:36,124
what other people are
gonna think, you know...

1916
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:39,749
I'm gonna be your mom forever,
and what people out there think

1917
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,458
doesn't even matter.
- Okay.

1918
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:46,374
- Muah.

1919
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:47,708
Bye.

1920
01:23:47,709 --> 01:23:49,582
Just feeling anxious about...

1921
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:52,249
about going in there,
and it's such a huge moment

1922
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,165
for-for everyone.

1923
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:56,083
You know,
I've gotten death threats,

1924
01:23:56,084 --> 01:23:59,958
and... people threatening
to hurt my kids.

1925
01:23:59,959 --> 01:24:02,791
As the lead detective
in the case,

1926
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:05,874
my job was to go
back over everything,

1927
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:09,749
as a homicide investigator,
with a fine-tooth comb.

1928
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:13,207
And I guess that's why
I felt so gut-wrenchingly,

1929
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:15,624
you know, torn
when the charges were brought,

1930
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:19,207
because I know
every detail of the case.

1931
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:22,291
It was a freak accident.

1932
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:29,500
I've been trying to pull up
on my phone...

1933
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:32,207
I can't get...
the thing is not coming up.

1934
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:34,457
- ...30 juveniles

1935
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:38,791
along Pratt Street,
towards the subway.

1936
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:41,249
- Not guilty!

1937
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,624
Not guilty!

1938
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:45,625
- Oh, God... God, I've missed it.

1939
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:54,332
Oh, damn it.
Damn it... oh, my...

1940
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:56,125
I'll be on it.

1941
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,999
- Not guilty on all.
- Oh!

1942
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,749
- ...arrest and death
of Freddie Gray.

1943
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,206
- We continue
to follow breaking news

1944
01:25:05,207 --> 01:25:06,792
of the trial
of Officer Caesar Goodson,

1945
01:25:06,793 --> 01:25:09,666
where he was just acquitted
on seven charges.

1946
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:11,289
- Yes!
- He was one of six officers

1947
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,957
charged in connection
with the arrest

1948
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,834
and death of Freddie Gray.
- Thank God.

1949
01:25:14,835 --> 01:25:17,165
- He has been found not guilty
on all charges.

1950
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:18,958
It's the signal up here,

1951
01:25:18,959 --> 01:25:20,834
'cause mine's not working
right now.

1952
01:25:20,835 --> 01:25:23,541
The one in the...

1953
01:25:23,542 --> 01:25:27,457
- Could people have been more
vigilant in the transport

1954
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,207
and everything?
Definitely.

1955
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:32,499
Could people have been
paying more attention?

1956
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,874
Definitely.
But as far as...

1957
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:38,708
across the country,
police brutality

1958
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:41,417
and stuff...
this wasn't the case.

1959
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:49,499
- Just look at
all of this bullshit.

1960
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,166
In fact...

1961
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:55,040
This is bullshit.

1962
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:56,791
- The judge...

1963
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:58,707
- Come on!
- Who is within his right,

1964
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:00,540
has made it clear
that he doesn't agree

1965
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:02,331
with the state's theory
of the case

1966
01:26:02,332 --> 01:26:04,208
and does not believe
that any of the actions

1967
01:26:04,209 --> 01:26:05,749
or inactions of these officers

1968
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,541
rise to the level
of criminality.

1969
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:10,667
We do not believe that
Freddie Gray killed himself.

1970
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,040
However,
after much thought and prayer,

1971
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:18,083
it has become clear
to me that, without being able

1972
01:26:18,084 --> 01:26:21,082
to work with an independent
investigatory agency

1973
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:24,040
from the very start,
without real substantive

1974
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:27,374
reforms to the current
criminal justice system,

1975
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:30,249
we could try this case
100 times...

1976
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:32,624
and cases just like it...
and we would still

1977
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:34,499
end up with the same result.

1978
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,249
- Yes, Marilyn!
- Accordingly,

1979
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,499
I have decided not to proceed
on the cases

1980
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,833
against Officer Garrett,
Sergeant Alisha White,

1981
01:26:41,834 --> 01:26:45,500
or to re-litigate the case
against William Porter.

1982
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:52,457
- We have no business
in this place.

1983
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:53,916
It's time to leave.

1984
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,416
It is time to leave and take

1985
01:26:55,417 --> 01:26:57,624
all of our beautiful creations
with us.

1986
01:26:57,625 --> 01:26:59,458
It is time to sue
these motherfuckers

1987
01:26:59,459 --> 01:27:01,499
for the appropriation
of everything cool,

1988
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,624
from fucking cornrows
to rap music... fuck it,

1989
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:05,708
every form of popular music
on planet Earth

1990
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:07,665
was built by us,
so sue they ass for it,

1991
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:09,623
get the money,
and get the fuck out of here.

1992
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:10,998
Take the light bulbs with you,
'cause we...

1993
01:27:10,999 --> 01:27:12,456
you know, we did that too.

1994
01:27:12,457 --> 01:27:14,291
And the traffic light,
we did that too.

1995
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:17,666
And peanut butter, and rope.
This shit is either gonna turn

1996
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:20,416
really, really, really,
really, really, really,

1997
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:24,040
really, really bad
really fast...

1998
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:25,750
or it's gonna be
hundreds of years

1999
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:28,875
of the same and, either way,
I fucking refuse.

2000
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,959
- The Justice
Department has released

2001
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,666
a scathing report on the
Baltimore Police Department

2002
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:38,749
which found
routine discrimination

2003
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,332
towards African Americans,

2004
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:42,165
rampant use
of excessive force...

2005
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:44,290
all without
proper accountability

2006
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:46,041
for misconduct.

2007
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:54,416
- Representatives
from the Department of Justice

2008
01:27:54,417 --> 01:27:56,582
are here
and they are listening.

2009
01:27:56,583 --> 01:27:58,708
If you haven't read the report,

2010
01:27:58,709 --> 01:28:00,290
you must read the report.

2011
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,165
Why?
Because I've read

2012
01:28:02,166 --> 01:28:03,708
a few of these, and this is

2013
01:28:03,709 --> 01:28:06,916
pretty much the worst
I've ever read.

2014
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,667
- One gentleman,
who's over 50 years old,

2015
01:28:08,668 --> 01:28:10,667
African American, was stopped
more than 30 times

2016
01:28:10,668 --> 01:28:13,249
during the five-year period
that we looked at.

2017
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:17,374
That makes us very concerned
that those stops were not

2018
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,250
on the basis
of reasonable suspicion,

2019
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:21,748
but instead were being done
under unconstitutional grounds.

2020
01:28:21,749 --> 01:28:23,959
We want the police and
the community to work together,

2021
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,666
and we need to try and start
rebuilding that relationship.

2022
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:28,000
- The last time I checked,

2023
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:30,457
the DOJ is a part
of the system.

2024
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:33,040
It's the DOJ, it's the FOP,

2025
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:34,666
and it's our elected officials,

2026
01:28:34,667 --> 01:28:37,958
and we as citizens are
not there at the table

2027
01:28:37,959 --> 01:28:39,873
as that thing
is being negotiated.

2028
01:28:39,874 --> 01:28:41,625
- My suggestion for solutions
to the DOJ is that

2029
01:28:41,626 --> 01:28:44,332
none of these reforms
and band-aids that are gonna

2030
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,874
happen should give more money

2031
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:47,375
to the Baltimore City
Police Department.

2032
01:28:47,376 --> 01:28:49,749
- Let me say this:

2033
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:55,541
I'm begging you
to work with this process.

2034
01:28:55,542 --> 01:28:57,165
This is the only one we got.

2035
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:59,708
- We met with you, Congressman.

2036
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:03,499
We told you what was going on
in this city.

2037
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,749
People in this room should
be ashamed of yourself!

2038
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,125
- 'Cause we're here tonight
giving y'all

2039
01:29:08,126 --> 01:29:09,916
our big, fat, "I told you so's."

2040
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:13,416
So go back and hold all of
these entities accountable,

2041
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:16,667
because you cannot do it
just with the police.

2042
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,791
- The law enforcement,
police department...

2043
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:26,207
we shoulder all
the woes of society.

2044
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:28,624
So I think when
the rest of government

2045
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:30,916
and the rest of society
realizes their role

2046
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:33,249
in public safety...
that's where housing,

2047
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,708
employment, education
comes into play...

2048
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:38,666
'cause if folks are waiting
for the police departments

2049
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:44,457
of America to do it,
they're gonna be out of luck.

2050
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:45,874
- I'm encouraged.

2051
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:47,541
I'm encouraged about Baltimore.

2052
01:29:47,542 --> 01:29:49,123
Um... there's been
a great awakening,

2053
01:29:49,124 --> 01:29:50,792
especially with
the DOJ coming in.

2054
01:29:50,793 --> 01:29:52,374
This will sound very odd,

2055
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:54,290
but it almost took
this uprising

2056
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:56,666
to wake us up.

2057
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:59,124
- I won't say nothing
came out of this.

2058
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:01,833
There's changes
in the police force.

2059
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:03,290
New protocol was made

2060
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:06,916
all because of the death
of Freddie.

2061
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:09,791
So I don't think
his death was a waste.

2062
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,333
I think Freddie was
more so a martyr.

2063
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:27,874
- It's always hard
for me to say

2064
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:30,499
that Freddie Gray
gave me a platform

2065
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,165
to do anything.

2066
01:30:32,166 --> 01:30:34,290
- No justice, no peace!

2067
01:30:34,291 --> 01:30:37,124
- But also,
the Baltimore uprising

2068
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:39,708
gave me space
to explore my politics,

2069
01:30:39,709 --> 01:30:41,749
and I think it did that
for a lot of people.

2070
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:44,375
And I think it produced
a lot of healing.

2071
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,375
- It's not about
what you do with your life,

2072
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:50,499
but it's about
the legacy that you leave.

2073
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,666
Freddie Gray was a dope boy.
He had lead paint poisoning.

2074
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:55,208
But Freddie Gray
sparked a movement

2075
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:56,833
and a radicalization,

2076
01:30:56,834 --> 01:30:58,581
and forced young people
into the streets.

2077
01:30:58,582 --> 01:31:00,500
So Freddie will always
be remembered

2078
01:31:00,501 --> 01:31:03,416
as somebody that sparked
an uprising

2079
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:04,999
inside of our minds,

2080
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,249
and I think that's
the most powerful thing

2081
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:09,458
that we can do...
is keep fighting for that.
