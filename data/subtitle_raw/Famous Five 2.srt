00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,437
MONASTERY OF THE MATHILENES

2
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,994
Wait down here.

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,636
Please...

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,120
We're a peaceful people. You've taken

5
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,392
everything we have.
- Everything?

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,954
Not yet.

7
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,556
Go on.

8
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,316
Stop! Reveal your identity!

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,600
Meow!

10
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,874
The Green Eye!

11
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,472
The most valuable emerald on earth.
- Please...

12
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,434
You can't do this.

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,558
Who's going to stop us?

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,592
Me!

15
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,517
You're not a thief?
- No.

16
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,917
I'm here to help you.

17
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,710
Who are you?

18
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,516
They call me the Black Cat.

19
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,396
Please, hide it for us.

20
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,033
Return it when the time is right.

21
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,511
I give you my word of honor.

22
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,199
You lost this during the fight.

23
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,276
<b>THE FAMOUS FIVE 2</b>

24
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,399
PRESENT, 102 KM
SOUTHWEST OF KIRRIN COTTAGE

25
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,516
Our first parent-free outing!
- Brilliant!

26
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,713
Yes, wonderful.

27
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,077
And finally together again.

28
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,398
Not the worst of things.

29
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,080
These are the Gaffenstone Rocks.

30
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,230
The Gaffenstone Rocks?
Never heard of them. - Come on!

31
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,718
It's not far now.

32
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,630
Welcome to the Cat Gorge.

33
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,958
Cat Gorge? - As long as
we stick to the roads, we're safe.

34
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,598
So? Have I promised too much?
- Cool!

35
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,956
Come on, let's fix us something to eat.

36
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,518
So, Dick, watch your step.

37
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,793
What's that supposed to mean?

38
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,472
Do you think I'm stupid?
- If you put it like that... Dick!

39
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,990
Oh man!

40
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,193
Didn't I just warn you?

41
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,670
Alright. No harm done.

42
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,999
Timmy, come on.

43
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
Timmy seems to
actually like aunt Fanny's food.

44
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,030
A mystery.

45
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,193
Dick, want one?
- No thanks, I've still got

46
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,074
this pizza.

47
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,070
What's on it?

48
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,639
Tuna, pineapple, spinach,

49
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,231
egg, salami and garlic.

50
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,034
My favorite combination!

51
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,551
Anyone want some?
- No, thanks!

52
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,795
Anne, it was only a toad.

53
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,951
An old legend surrounds this area.

54
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,395
Which one?

55
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,399
Ever heard of the Black Cat?

56
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,115
No, Timmy, it's not a real cat.
- He was a kind of Robin Hood.

57
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,275
He saved the Green Eye
for the tribe of the Mathilenes.

58
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,310
The Green Eye?
- The largest emerald on earth.

59
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,156
To the Mathilenes
it was a symbol of peace and happiness.

60
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,273
Yes, thank you, Dick.

61
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,597
Pleasure.

62
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,111
Ever since the stone disappeared

63
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,710
the Mathilenes have been cursed.

64
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,153
Why didn't the Black Cat return
the Green Eye? - It's presumed

65
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,276
the Black Cat hid the stone
in a secret place and then died

66
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,155
before he could tell the Mathilenes.

67
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,673
What's it to do with this area?

68
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,032
The Black Cat's said to have lived here.

69
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,637
That's really scary!

70
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,436
Does that mean

71
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,519
the stone could be hidden here?

72
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,193
Hey, show yourself!

73
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,836
What are you doing here?

74
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,316
And you?

75
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,436
Are you vagrants, or something?

76
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,669
Do we look like vagrants?

77
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,399
Oh Dick!

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,275
Never mind.

79
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,234
I'm Hardy.
- I'm Julian.

80
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,320
They're Dick and Anne.
- That's Timmy,

81
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,832
and I'm George.
- George? But you're not a boy!

82
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,398
After all, I'm not called...

83
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,910
Harriette!

84
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,113
Pity. It'd suit you a lot better.

85
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,358
Someone's very touchy!

86
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,994
So what do we do now?

87
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,556
"We"? How do you mean?

88
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,913
Let's go to my place.
I could show you... - Not interested.

89
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,793
We want to camp out here.
- Camp!

90
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,389
You're a bunch of freaks!

91
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,956
Why?

92
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,471
There's a huge thunderstorm on its way.
- Really?

93
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,592
So what? We're not made of sugar.

94
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,029
In case you change your minds...

95
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,598
I'm getting into safety.
I'll check up on you tomorrow.

96
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,394
Please don't!

97
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,230
Strange sort of guy.
- Kind of, yes.

98
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,478
Nice of him to invite us over.

99
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,318
He could be right
about the thunderstorm.

100
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,310
It'll pass over.

101
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,674
I guarantee it.

102
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,312
Not a word!

103
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,960
It smells funny here.

104
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,073
Did you know
the human scent attracts midges?

105
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,591
This smell renders us invisible to them.

106
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,076
Give it to me!

107
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,439
They were as good as new!
- Quiet. I want to sleep.

108
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,552
Good night.
- Night...

109
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,233
Wasn't it to your liking, Hardy?

110
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,437
It was. Excellent, Gisbert!

111
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,436
Thank you.

112
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,116
<i>Hello, my boy!</i>

113
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,473
<i>Sorry for not calling before.</i>
- That's okay, Dad.

114
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,231
I'm glad. How's work?

115
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,675
<i>Fine. Unfortunately I have to stay here
a little longer. The deal's dragging on.</i>

116
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,393
I understand.
<i>- I'll bring you something marvelous.</i>

117
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,470
<i>How's Roby?</i>

118
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,797
He's right beside me.
<i>- I am Roby!</i>

119
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,277
<i>The things you teach him!</i>

120
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,036
<i>I have to go.</i>

121
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,315
<i>Don't get up to any nonsense, okay?</i>
- Of course not.

122
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,314
See you...

123
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,994
... soon, Dad.

124
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,676
<i>You can hear</i>

125
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,591
<i>the sunshine in every note!
This is Coastal Radio One</i>

126
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,158
<i>with an important message:
police report the escape of the criminal</i>

127
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,593
<i>Rookey Burns.
He broke out of jail last night.</i>

128
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,193
<i>Burns is 1.86 meters tall
and has short-cropped, dark blonde hair.</i>

129
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,869
<i>If you see the fugitive,</i>

130
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,391
<i>please report it to the police at once.</i>

131
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,676
<i>Burns managed to steal a service
weapon and is considered most dangerous.</i>

132
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,834
The fledgling is leaving the nest!

133
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,869
Roger that!

134
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,757
So when's this Hardy coming?

135
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,479
I meant him, weirdo!

136
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,636
Oh yeah.

137
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,953
We'll meet up at the rail bridge.

138
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,519
You pushed me under six times!
- You squirted water at me.

139
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,599
No, I didn't.
- You did.

140
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,715
No!

141
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,873
Morning, freaks!
- Hello.

142
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,152
Morning.
- Let me introduce:

143
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,716
that's Roby.

144
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,237
Cool, right?

145
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,276
My father brought it from Singapore.
You can't even buy it here yet.

146
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,114
<i>Roby, your friend.</i>

147
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,676
Hey, dog, he's delicate.

148
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,757
He's called Timmy.
- Sit!

149
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,636
Doesn't he know "sit"?

150
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,152
He doesn't listen to just anyone.
He's a clever dog.

151
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,471
If he's that clever, what can he do?

152
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,280
Timmy's the greatest dog in the world.
He can do anything. - Yeah?

153
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,915
Like what?

154
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,356
Play dead?

155
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
What good is that?
Look at what Roby can do!

156
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,677
<i>I am Roby,</i>

157
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,395
<i>your friend.</i>

158
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,274
That's got you rattled.
Now Timmy'll chicken out. Wanna bet?

159
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,152
What're you doing?
<i>- Friend...</i>

160
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,273
That settles that.

161
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,718
Let's pack up. - You're leaving?
- Yes, we have to move on.

162
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,075
Awesome!

163
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,476
Cool, right?
- Is it an XP5?

164
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,196
No, an XP7. Straight from Japan.

165
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,120
You can't even get it here yet.

166
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,793
Wanna take it for a spin? - Yeah,
but don't you have to be 16 to drive it?

167
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,393
Not if you're on your own land.

168
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,833
All this belongs to my family.

169
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,720
No, Dick.
- Why not? - It's much too dangerous.

170
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,038
You've never driven one of those!

171
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,836
It's very easy.
- I don't know...

172
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,237
But I do. I'll do it.

173
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,869
Oh man!

174
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,398
Man, what an idiot!

175
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,992
I'd better put this in quarantine.

176
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,874
What's keeping Dick?
I want to get going.

177
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,390
Maybe I'll come with you.

178
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,080
We've got him.

179
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,590
I'm starting to get really worried.

180
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,475
I hope nothing's happened to him.

181
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,793
We'd better go and check it out.
- Okay.

182
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,109
Dick!

183
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,997
Man, my quad!

184
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,079
Why can't he listen to me just once?
- Where is he?

185
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,036
The quad's alright.

186
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,916
You're not serious?

187
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,674
My brother's had an accident,
and all you care about is your quad?

188
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,676
But...
- This is all your fault!

189
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,315
Bugger off!

190
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,274
And leave us alone.

191
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,954
DICK CALLING
It's Dick!

192
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,115
What's happened?

193
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,556
I'm not Hardy!

194
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,151
<i>I'm Dick Kirrin!</i>
- What's going on?

195
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,879
<i>Yeah, yeah, I get it.
And I'm Santa Claus.</i>

196
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,597
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

197
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,269
<i>To a safe place.</i>

198
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,837
My friends will call the police.

199
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,999
And they'll come looking for me.

200
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm really scared now!

201
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,719
At the slightest whiff of the police...

202
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
... we're gone!

203
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,751
We'll leave you behind all by yourself.

204
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,590
Where no one'll find you!

205
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,637
<i>We're almost there. This hideout...</i>

206
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,396
<i>Why?</i>

207
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,116
I'm your brother and I say so!

208
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,553
Stop talking so much.

209
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,120
What's that?

210
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,795
Are you jerking us around?

211
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,435
DISCONNECTED

212
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,317
Dick's been kidnapped! - They think
he's Hardy. - He drove his quad.

213
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,035
And wore his stuff.

214
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,231
Now what?
- We have to find Dick.

215
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,876
How? Without any clues?

216
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,236
What's that?

217
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,276
A button. Maybe Dick

218
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,598
tore it off one of the kidnappers.

219
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,314
What's that symbol?

220
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,598
I don't know. But I do know who might.

221
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,030
You have visitors.

222
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,471
It's alright.

223
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,751
What do you want?
- Dick's been kidnapped!

224
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,956
Why would anyone kidnap him? Ridiculous.

225
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,713
They thought he was you, that's why.
He was wearing your stuff.

226
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,959
What? I was going to be kidnapped?

227
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,155
Unbelievable.

228
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,432
What would they want with you?
- No idea.

229
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,313
Ransom money?

230
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,197
It might not look like it,
but we're very wealthy.

231
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,594
I'm calling the police.
- Wait!

232
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,835
If the kidnappers find out,
we'll never find Dick.

233
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,996
You heard what those villains said.

234
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,794
We have to find Dick ourselves.

235
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,110
Man, that's totally dangerous.

236
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,280
So what? We're talking about Dick here.

237
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,994
Have you ever seen this symbol?

238
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,632
Sorry. Never seen it before.

239
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,396
Hardy...

240
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,274
You know something.

241
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,670
I don't want anything to do with it.
- You won't tell us?

242
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,993
Never mind. Let's go.

243
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,476
Have fun with that Roby of yours.
We'll manage without you.

244
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,149
Come on!

245
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,040
<i>Roby, your friend.</i>

246
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,790
<i>Hardy need friend.</i>

247
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,718
So what do we do now?

248
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,359
Take it slow, for a start.

249
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,918
So he can catch up with us.
- You think he'll come? - Sure.

250
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,477
Who else is he going to brag to?

251
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,389
Wait!

252
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,436
See?

253
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,399
I can't let you freaks down.

254
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,800
Maybe I have seen the symbol before.

255
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,516
Where?

256
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,834
Okay, Hardy...

257
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,553
Now spit it out.
- I...

258
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,397
am not Hardy.

259
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,596
Good one.

260
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,399
Nice try.

261
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,595
We have the map.

262
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,230
What map?

263
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,396
The one leading us to the Green Eye.

264
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,351
It'll make us stinking rich.

265
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,360
You're after the Green Eye?
- What else?

266
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,680
But what's Hardy got to do with it?
- Stop playing dumb. We need the song.

267
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,754
Once more: there's been a mix up.
- How stupid do you think I am?

268
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,154
We've dealt with tougher guys than you.

269
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,275
Yeah.

270
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,718
Like who, for instance?

271
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,910
Well, for instance with...

272
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,279
Never mind, it doesn't matter.

273
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,672
I'll get you talking yet.

274
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,877
I even know how.

275
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,836
I was right. See that?
- It's the symbol of the circus.

276
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,959
If we find a man with a button missing
from his coat... - He'll lead us to Dick.

277
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,915
<i>If we want to find Dick, we have to
stay one step ahead of the kidnappers.</i>

278
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,037
Yeah.

279
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,678
Sounds like a plan.
- Here's the best part!

280
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,514
I've got more stuff.

281
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,114
Oh God.

282
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,276
Mega cool, right? You won't believe
the punch this baby packs.

283
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,200
Cut the crap, okay?

284
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,997
I'll take that.
- So what do we do now?

285
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,154
Anyone got an idea?

286
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,439
Except for Hardy?

287
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,600
Good boy.

288
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,073
Not bad.

289
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,510
Great!

290
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,633
Good boy.
- Wow!

291
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,230
Not bad at all, but for a circus act...

292
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,070
I don't know...
- Pity.

293
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,035
Could we have a look around anyway?

294
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,349
My friends and I
all want to join the circus one day.

295
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,237
Yeah.

296
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,353
Sure you can have a look around.

297
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,757
But don't get up to anything, okay?
- Of course not.

298
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,873
Thank you.
- Okay.

299
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,520
Why would I want a hammer?
- I know vintage cars.

300
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,873
Just hit the engine block once,
and it'll run smoothly again.

301
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,837
How nice of you to help me.

302
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,600
My pleasure.

303
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,520
Nice... jackets.
Do you make them yourself?

304
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,360
Most of them, yes.

305
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,399
Did you see a boy with a cap?

306
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,239
Yes, he went that way...
into the circus tent. - Thanks.

307
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,358
You no longer have a will of your own.

308
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,996
You'll do everything we tell you.

309
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,280
Yes, everything we tell you.
- Yeah. Everything

310
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,076
we tell you.

311
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,836
So?

312
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,279
What's the tune?

313
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,079
Go on, birdie, sing!

314
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,917
0-3-4-9 and the pizza's mine.

315
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,154
Brilliant!

316
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,474
And what is it?

317
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,511
What?
- This "0-3-4-9 and the pizza's mine"?

318
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,631
The "Maxi Pizza" commercial?

319
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,277
Damn.

320
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,879
Stop jerking us around!

321
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,114
Sorry. I'm hungry.

322
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,438
All I can think about is pizza.

323
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,391
Okay... Get him one.

324
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,516
A what?

325
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,514
A trumpet.

326
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,516
Why a trumpet?
I thought you wanted him to sing.

327
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,713
A pizza, of course, you idiot!

328
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,271
Why me?

329
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,992
Because I'm telling you!

330
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,753
And return the car to the circus.

331
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,159
I have to make a call.

332
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,639
"And return the car to the circus."

333
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,832
Yes, older brothers think
they own the world. Believe me,

334
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,590
I know what I'm talking about.

335
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,516
You do?

336
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,950
Yes.

337
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,554
Did you know that
80 percent of all younger brothers

338
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,277
are more intelligent
than their older brothers and sisters?

339
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,116
I knew it!

340
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,033
But wait a minute...

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,598
I'm the older one.

342
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,877
You're the better-looking one.

343
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,115
What kind of pizza d'you want me to get?

344
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,439
Hey, great make-up. Going somewhere?

345
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,998
Is Peppino going somewhere?
- The button!

346
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,274
Come on!

347
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,319
Hello, kids.

348
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,240
Have you tried Gerda's

349
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,319
wonderful almonds? They're famous.

350
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,160
Maybe later.

351
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,790
Damn.

352
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,276
Damn, where's he gone?
- He must be in one of the trailers.

353
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,631
Come on.

354
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,154
Where are the others? We've checked
everyone out. - No idea.

355
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,230
Here you are, they're on the house.
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

356
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,911
Enjoy them.
- Thank you.

357
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,795
Careful, it doesn't look very stable.
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,395
Yes, hello?

359
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,994
So tell me,

360
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,672
do you and your butler live all alone
in that house? - Most of the time.

361
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,273
How about your parents?
- There's only my dad.

362
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,760
And he's away a lot.
On business trips and stuff.

363
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,150
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,590
No need.

365
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,397
Let me have a look.
- You don't wanna see that.

366
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,959
Want one, too?
- No, thanks.

367
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,198
They're my favorite candy.

368
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,556
No joke. A pizza with tuna, pineapple,
egg, salami and spinach.

369
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,832
Oh, and garlic, too.

370
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,718
It's not my thing, either,
but please, Gerda. - Okay.

371
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,279
Who'd eat something like that?
- Dick. Watch him. I'll get the others.

372
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,918
What?
- Just do as I tell you!

373
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,276
Women!

374
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,555
It's him.

375
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,280
There's a button missing.
- What?

376
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,439
Damn! How did that happen?

377
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,040
Julian!

378
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,473
Come down! Our man's over there!

379
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,390
No, he's in here...

380
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,591
What?

381
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,871
I know! Fil must've mixed up our
jackets when he brought me the car key.

382
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,230
Sorry.

383
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,116
Carry on.

384
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,629
Come on!

385
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,911
To the bicycles, quick!

386
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,160
Come back at once!

387
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,994
It's not funny!

388
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,637
What is this place? - The Owls' Nest.
It belongs to old Count Hamingham.

389
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,800
But he goes salmon fishing
in Alaska every summer.

390
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,959
So the house is empty?

391
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,119
An ideal place to hide someone.

392
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,390
Now!

393
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,358
Come on, this way!

394
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,036
It's really scary here.

395
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,679
You could say that again.
Not a trace of a signal.

396
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,517
Do you think there are ghosts here?
- There's no such thing as ghosts.

397
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,236
Scientists don't agree on that.

398
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,230
Did you know that many paranormal
activities have never been...

399
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,830
Come on.

400
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,630
So?

401
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,076
Will you sing now?

402
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,431
I'd like to, but it just
doesn't come to me. I need dessert.

403
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,476
Something sweet
to activate my brain areas.

404
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,589
Right, you little runt...

405
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,153
If you think you can play for time,
you've got another think coming.

406
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,320
Your good old friend Rookey
will show up in the morning.

407
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,912
Then you'll sing like a canary.
I guarantee it.

408
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,397
Rookey? Who's Rookey?

409
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,800
He still has a score to settle with you.

410
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,278
Let me go first.

411
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,480
What was that?

412
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,679
Oh man.
- Sorry...

413
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,236
No idea.

414
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,879
I'll check it out.

415
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,477
Want to see something funny?

416
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,636
Not so loud.

417
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,472
Bugger off, you fleabag!

418
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,716
Careful.

419
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,513
Quiet!
- Wait, let me.

420
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,111
After him!

421
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,553
Come on, Timmy!

422
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,069
Dick must be held here somewhere.
- Let's have a look, but be quiet.

423
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,916
Come on.

424
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,155
Hello, hello!

425
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,717
That's very good.
- Right? Look, there's no window pane.

426
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,270
Thank you.

427
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,835
But I've got another one. Watch this.

428
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,715
Smell those.

429
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,877
Very funny.
- Right?

430
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,878
I always wanted to be a clown, but...

431
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,919
my brother said it wasn't a real job.

432
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,314
And criminal is?

433
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,440
Your brother's really been
putting the screws on me.

434
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,119
Yeah, that's right.

435
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,272
Got a cold?
- No, it's my allergy.

436
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,713
I just came across
one of Hamingham's cats.

437
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,516
But you're only allergic to dogs.

438
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,439
Yes, that's what I always thought.

439
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,276
Timmy!

440
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,394
What did you just say?

441
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,830
Nothing, I...

442
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,034
I meant, Tim...

443
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,550
...buktu.

444
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,519
Did you know Timbuktu's an oasis town

445
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,680
with a population of 54,453,
and that the name

446
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,510
means "Well of Buktu"?

447
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,997
Listen to all the things the runt knows.

448
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,239
The only thing he's forgotten
is the song!

449
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,393
Where was I?

450
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,200
Oh yeah, over there by the door.

451
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,710
Thanks.

452
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,910
Timmy...

453
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,669
Now what?

454
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,998
We must've been everywhere by now.

455
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,430
Timmy!

456
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,552
He would've found him ages ago. If only
we had something that smells of Dick.

457
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,316
Oh no.

458
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,235
Please, no. - What's wrong with you?
It's only a... Oh my God!

459
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,353
I'm dying!
- Timmy,

460
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,473
you have to be very brave now.

461
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,434
Smell that, Timmy.

462
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,400
Find him, Timmy. Go on.

463
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,234
Good boy, find him!

464
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,715
Yes, go on.

465
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,870
They came from upstairs.
- We've been there. - So we missed it.

466
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,913
Okay, go on, Timmy.

467
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,800
Why open the window?

468
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,360
The way you fart all night?

469
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,230
Ridiculous.

470
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,513
You do. You fart in your sleep.
You just don't notice.

471
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,360
So sleep somewhere else.

472
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,077
You sleep somewhere else!

473
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,159
Now don't be cheeky.

474
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,553
It goes on here.

475
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,478
How long's this stuff been hanging here?
- At least a hundred years.

476
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,152
It must lead somewhere.

477
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,031
It's alright, Timmy.
The dog's only in the painting.

478
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,749
Now what?

479
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,750
Someone's knocking.

480
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,835
They're ancient pipes.

481
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,636
They tend to make noise.

482
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,680
Pipes don't know SOS.

483
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,356
It's Dick!

484
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,200
Great, Timmy!

485
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,314
We must be able to open it.

486
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,756
There has to be something.

487
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,800
Bingo!

488
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,791
Not bad.

489
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,314
Come on.

490
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,239
Dick?
- Yes.

491
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,036
Everything okay?
- Yes, I'm alright.

492
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,439
I'm so glad you're here.
- So are we.

493
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,473
We'll never get it open.
- We need the key. - Dick,

494
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,195
what do they want from you?

495
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,077
They keep asking about a song
that leads to the Green Eye.

496
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,319
The Green Eye?
- What's the Green Eye to you?

497
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,400
My great-great-great-grandfather
Archibald Kent was said to have been

498
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,196
the Black Cat and to have hidden
the Green Eye. - What?

499
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,711
The Black Cat was your ancestor?

500
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,277
Hardy,

501
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,394
what song could it be?
- I've no idea.

502
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,229
I really don't know what they mean.

503
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,273
Honestly.
- Okay.

504
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,036
We'll settle that later.
Let's find the key first.

505
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,871
But hurry! Tomorrow morning
a certain Rookey is going to show up.

506
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,950
Rookey...
- He has a score to settle with Hardy.

507
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,596
Hey, Dick...

508
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,717
we'll get you out of here.
- Promise? - Sure.

509
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,833
I won't let my favorite brother down.

510
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,233
Thanks, Julian.

511
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,677
Goes without saying. Let's go.

512
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,434
I can't sleep.

513
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,272
No wonder, if you keep talking.
Just shut up.

514
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,672
Listen...
- What?

515
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,236
They're awake.

516
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,956
Night.

517
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,470
Good night.

518
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,511
So who is this Rookey?

519
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,834
A former business partner
of my father's.

520
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,560
He was always in and out of our house.

521
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,595
One day I caught him red-handed.

522
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,474
He was stealing from us.

523
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,475
I called the police at once, of course.

524
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,877
And Rookey was arrested.

525
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,119
Turned out he was a wanted criminal.

526
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,356
Oh man.

527
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,556
Now I know what he'd been searching for.
- The Green Eye.

528
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,509
I thought Rookey

529
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,679
was a friend.

530
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,639
I haven't trusted anyone since.

531
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,673
You can trust us.

532
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,194
Does that mean...

533
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,439
we're something like friends?

534
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,596
Sure.

535
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,519
Okay, let's go.

536
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,194
Okay,
we'll have to go through the window.

537
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,437
Sure, great plan! We just abseil from
above and climb in through the window!

538
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,633
Great.
- Okay, let's go.

539
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,433
Oh man, I was joking!

540
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,115
Quite a drop.

541
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,196
I'll do it.

542
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,834
Too low.

543
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,480
Okay, he's in.

544
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,753
I know another one. Another one.

545
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,198
See?
- What?

546
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,518
Man, you farted.

547
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,233
Stop blabbing.

548
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,354
Go to sleep!

549
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,195
Everything you can do, I can do better.

550
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,672
What's keeping Julian?

551
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,830
Smell that?

552
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,675
Oh man.

553
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,152
That was a good one.

554
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,234
Pull him up!

555
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,113
Alright. Come on, let's go save Dick.

556
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,914
Come on, Hardy.

557
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,310
Everything alright, Brother?
- Yes, everything's alright.

558
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,750
We have to go, the sun's coming up.

559
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,758
Come on, hurry up!

560
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,439
What's going on here? Stop! Don't move!

561
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,752
What's all this?

562
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,078
Shut up!
- Run away!

563
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,790
Stay calm.

564
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,711
What are you doing? Save yourself!

565
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,196
The gate's open!

566
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,874
What does the mutt want?
- Leave them alone.

567
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,310
What?

568
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,314
It's me you want.

569
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,118
Rookey!
- You could've run, but you came back?

570
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,516
Why?

571
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,795
It's what friends do.

572
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,038
Oh, how nice!

573
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,150
Little Hardy's found some friends!

574
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,034
But this is Hardy!

575
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,711
Nonsense!
- This is him!

576
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,311
This little runt and me go way back,

577
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,353
right? You idiots!

578
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,477
What are all these brats doing here?
- No idea where they all came from.

579
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,517
Let the others go. It's nothing to do
with them. - So they can rat on us?

580
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,233
Go on.
- Come here.

581
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,953
Timmy, no!

582
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,880
Let me go. Timmy!

583
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,118
No! Timmy!

584
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,960
Let me go!

585
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,390
What's he done?

586
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,911
Don't make such a fuss, man.
It was an accident.

587
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,271
No, Timmy!

588
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,670
Come on.

589
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,599
Go on!
- Let me go. Timmy!

590
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,915
Cut the dramatics, will you?

591
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,956
It was only a dog.
- The cleverest dog on earth! - Oh, sure.

592
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,073
Stupid enough to get himself shot.

593
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,400
Surprise!

594
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,991
This is the old map
that belonged to your brilliant

595
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,478
great-great-
great-great-great-grandfather,

596
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,276
the Black Cat.

597
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,196
"I do not tend to joke.

598
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,518
Listen to this rhyme.

599
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,919
A lullaby straight from the heart,
add an N

600
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,320
and it will lead you to the stone."
I'm pretty sure

601
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,353
you can sing us this song.

602
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,797
Start singing, I'm losing my patience.

603
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,355
Leave him alone. It's obvious
he doesn't know. - What's this?

604
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,319
An heirloom from my granddad

605
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,480
who got it from his granddad.
- A worthless trinket.

606
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,357
A lullaby...

607
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,958
"A lullaby straight from the heart,

608
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,552
add an N
and it will lead you to the stone."

609
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,390
That's it.

610
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,879
You're trying to tell me you didn't know?
- I didn't!

611
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,073
I didn't know it could be opened.

612
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,630
A likely story!

613
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,120
Timmy only played dead.
- What?

614
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,793
The solution must lie
within the notes of this lullaby.

615
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,630
Rookey, you're brilliant.

616
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,270
You...

617
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,957
Which of you can play the piano?

618
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,874
You?

619
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,550
I think... you can.

620
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,790
Play.

621
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,159
Which notes are they?

622
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,829
G, C, D,

623
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,680
C, B,

624
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,237
A, E, C, E.

625
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,073
"Gcdcbaece."

626
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,471
Brilliant!

627
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,197
Now play it again.

628
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,276
Stop.

629
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,234
Just the left hand.

630
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,314
Which notes are those?

631
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,035
G, A, F, F, E.

632
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,358
G, A, F, F, E? Gaffe!

633
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,440
"Add an N..."

634
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,711
Gaffen!

635
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,394
"It will lead you to the stone."

636
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,711
Gaffenstone!

637
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,672
The Gaffenstone Rocks!

638
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,871
That's where the Green Eye's hidden.

639
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,192
Then let's get going.

640
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,476
He's coming, too.

641
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,195
He could be of use to us.
- Come along.

642
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,149
Take care.
- That's enough, come on.

643
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,638
Stop it, cut it out!

644
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,637
Timmy.

645
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,436
Come on.

646
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,678
Come here, quick!

647
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,315
Good boy.

648
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,160
Bite the rope.

649
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,993
He can't even drive a car!

650
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,672
He can't do anything.
- Seems to run in the family.

651
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,317
Man, oh man.

652
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,517
You okay, Anne?
- Yes, I'm alright.

653
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,195
Come on, let's save this freak.
- To the Gaffenstone Rocks! - Timmy!

654
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,993
Come on, give it to me.

655
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,754
This way!

656
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,830
Now this way.

657
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,233
There's the car!
- Yeah!

658
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,592
There's no way in here.
Maybe someplace else.

659
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,635
Then why park the car here?
- Dick's right.

660
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,356
Let's have a look here first.
- Timmy?

661
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,671
Timmy's found something.
- A mint candy?

662
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,431
Hardy always eats them.
- He probably wanted to give us a clue.

663
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,800
We have to move this thing.

664
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,950
Awesome!

665
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,000
Not bad!

666
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,270
Come on.

667
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,631
Ten, eleven,

668
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,037
twelve, thirteen...

669
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,950
This way.

670
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,390
And stay right behind me, get it?

671
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,037
What did I say?

672
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,439
Who'd do such a thing?
- The Black Cat, you moron,

673
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,916
who else?

674
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,192
To protect the stone
from people like you!

675
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,632
Luckily we've got the map. Come on.

676
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,400
Let's move on.

677
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,076
One,

678
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,196
two,

679
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,356
three...
- Hello?

680
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,234
Four...
- Move!

681
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,995
Five...

682
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,591
Hello?

683
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,836
Watch out.

684
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,391
Careful. It's going downhill here.

685
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,111
It's an old rope trap.

686
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,710
Pretty clever.

687
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,036
We'd better go that way.

688
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:51,791
Let's go.

689
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,239
No, those brats again!

690
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,072
Everything okay?
- Yes. I'm alright.

691
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,830
I thought you tied them up?
- We did.

692
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,513
They're getting on my nerves, just like
you two. Can't you do anything right?

693
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,189
Never mind.

694
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,190
They won't get anywhere without the map.
Right...

695
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,074
We have to go...

696
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,034
this way. Come on.

697
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,634
Get going.

698
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,836
What's this?

699
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,915
Did you think

700
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,238
you could trick us?

701
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,678
You thought wrong.

702
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,869
Not with me.

703
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,480
Don't take the right...
- Quiet!

704
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,831
Move!

705
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,710
Go on.

706
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,476
A candy!

707
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,071
So that must be the right way.
- I'll go first.

708
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,556
Alright.

709
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:26,996
Come on, Timmy.

710
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,400
We have to hurry.

711
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,910
Timmy, come on!

712
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,431
No, Timmy, this way. Come on.

713
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,674
Hurry up!

714
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,912
What's keeping you?

715
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,440
Slippery, careful.

716
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,996
It's really scary here.

717
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,600
Wait a minute.

718
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,309
If they'd come this way,
the spider's web would've been damaged.

719
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,040
Damn. You mean...

720
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,917
We went the wrong way?
- Yes, it's a trap! - Get down!

721
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,711
God, you gave me a fright.

722
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,313
Bad luck, I'd say.

723
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,195
They're my friends!
- I believe...

724
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,831
they were your friends.

725
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,790
Come on.

726
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,791
Move.

727
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,155
Hot, hot!

728
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,875
Move it!

729
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,280
Sometimes it ain't bad...

730
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,439
to have a big brother.

731
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,870
Let's go back.

732
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,755
In one of these holes
the Green Eye is hidden.

733
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,600
Which one?

734
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,634
We'll find out in a minute.

735
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,189
Ocu...

736
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,920
Oculus.

737
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,955
Rookey, you're brilliant.
- Shut up!

738
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,111
Oculus...

739
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,234
Viridis.

740
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,632
"The Green Eye".

741
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,474
At last!

742
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,072
How long have I been waiting for this!

743
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,715
What are you laughing at?

744
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,191
Nothing.

745
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,154
Nothing at all.

746
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,311
You know something, smarty-pants?

747
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,955
You take it out.

748
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,230
Go on!

749
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,875
Do it!

750
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,717
And what if it's a trap?
- In that case...

751
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,311
you're out of luck.

752
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,590
Okay.

753
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,110
Shut up!

754
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,515
Put it out!

755
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,110
Is your hand okay?
- Yes, fine.

756
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,711
But I've got something here...

757
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,680
Mega cool!

758
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,910
Come on!

759
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,079
I can't see a thing.
- Come on!

760
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,072
Come on, you morons!
- I can't see a thing! - Stupid jerks.

761
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,599
I don't believe it.

762
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,835
Hurry up!

763
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,993
Not the bikes. They'll catch up with us.
- Then where to?

764
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,477
Up the hill, come on!

765
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,356
They're up there.
Come on, you dickheads, I'll drive.

766
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,436
Up there!

767
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,630
Come on!

768
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,911
Hurry up!

769
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,199
Hurry!
- Come on, hurry!

770
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,160
Damn.
- Back up!

771
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,150
Back up!

772
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,350
You hotshot!

773
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,520
There they are!

774
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,074
Stop! - Damn it!
- Faster! - Run, Timmy!

775
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,351
To the circus!

776
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,917
To the circus. I know a short cut.

777
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,633
What's that I see?

778
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,915
Whipped cream.

779
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,358
Go on, hurry up.

780
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,950
I have to go to the stables.

781
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,671
To the stables? To do what?

782
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,511
What do you think? Horse around!

783
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,310
Don't you like it?
- It's boring.

784
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,792
Faster!
- Come on.

785
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,195
Over there!
- Anne! - Hurry up!

786
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,512
Watch out!
- Hurry!

787
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,234
Ladies and Gentlemen,

788
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,830
and now,

789
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,112
to conclude our show, here's...

790
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,789
the Flying Peppino!

791
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,629
Call the police!

792
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,675
Out of the way!

793
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,630
That does it!

794
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,234
There, it's off! Let's hear a big...

795
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,831
Go! Go! Go!

796
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,638
They're criminals. Arrest them!

797
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,799
Call the police!
- What did you say?

798
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:14,075
They kidnapped my brother!
- They tried to steal this stone.

799
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,791
Yeah, yeah, it's alright.

800
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,469
Where's Rookey?

801
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,719
Give me that stone.

802
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,474
Catch!

803
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,677
Hey, it belongs to me!

804
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,475
Out of my way!

805
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,400
No more fun and games.

806
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,200
Just you wait...

807
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,309
What's she doing?
- George!

808
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,319
Oh my god!

809
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,997
George! - Be careful.
- Are you crazy? - I'll get you!

810
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,760
Just you wait!

811
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,351
Watch out!

812
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,396
Stay calm, George.
- You can do it.

813
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,912
Watch out, he's stepped onto the rope!
- Oh yeah.

814
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,037
Careful!

815
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,275
You can do it.
- Slowly.

816
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,160
What?
- She can't get down.

817
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,436
Wait!

818
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,712
Quick, hurry!

819
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,435
Good idea.

820
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,632
George, catch this.

821
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,560
Quick!

822
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,270
What are you doing?

823
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,957
Pull it hard!
- Come on!

824
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,751
Quick, the bathtub.
- Hurry, hurry!

825
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,317
Come on.

826
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,400
It's the coolest show I've ever seen.

827
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,113
Okay.
- Get back!

828
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,071
These damned brats!

829
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,076
That was all for today,

830
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,117
Ladies and Gentlemen!
We're really glad you liked...

831
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,517
our show.

832
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,072
Come back soon.

833
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,115
Pair of losers.

834
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,678
Last stop jail.
- You're a loser yourself.

835
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,109
But I'm a clown!

836
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,997
Bravo!
Kids, you did a really good job.

837
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,238
We thought
we'd lost every trail of Rookey Burns.

838
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,714
They didn't reckon with the Famous Five!

839
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,831
Nor with me.

840
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,597
Sorry. Pronto?

841
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,950
In that case...
- Let's get this over with.

842
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,356
Alright.

843
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,872
I owe you a great deal of gratitude.

844
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,800
Don't thank me, thank the children.

845
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,000
You kept the Black Cat's promise.

846
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,037
We'll never forget this.

847
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,190
Thank you.

848
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,032
The pleasure was all ours.

849
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,996
Is there anything I can do for you?

850
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,471
No.

851
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,030
No.

852
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,599
How a about a photograph as a keepsake?
