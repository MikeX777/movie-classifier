00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,786
Hey. Everybody,

7
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,661
As you know, today's
Belle's last day.

8
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,701
Aw!

9
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:35,669
And I'll tell you this.
You're the best man I've ever had.

10
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:38,240
Aw.

11
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,071
Aw, come on, now.
Look, look.

12
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,737
I just want you to know
I just stayed ahead of you

13
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:46,076
because I know you enjoyed
the view.

14
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:47,809

15
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,817
Anyway.

16
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,547
We're all real proud of you
for finally getting your taxi license.

17
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,988
Knowing that you're behind
the wheel of a taxi in our fair city

18
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,220
makes us want to move
to Albany.

19
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,559
Listen, I seen these sparkle in a window,
and I knew they had your name on them.

20
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:05,691
Come on, I thought they'd be perfect for you.
Check it out. You're gonna love 'em.

21
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,793
- Oh, wow.
- This is you, girl.

22
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:12,334
- Oh, my God.
- Ah? Ah?

23
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,105
- It's a titanium supercharger!
- Yeah!

24
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,477
- Oh, my God.
- That's gonna be some taxi, Belle.

25
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:21,675
- It's just my size too!
- That's right, Belle.

26
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,718
Please don't leave us.
Don't leave us.

27
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,587
All right. Time's up, man. Come on. Get your

29
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,786
Oooh!

30
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:36,228
- Shut up! None of your business.
- Back to work. Let's go. Everybody.

31
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,233
I could have got the package there
with a horse and buggy. Back to work.

32
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:42,964
- What you doin' here?
- I called in a favor. They let me
take the rest of the day off.

33
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:45,563
- All right.
- Wait a minute.

34
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:51,805
- Wait a minute who you wearin' perfume for?
- What?

35
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,610
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I cut through Macy's I got tagged.

36
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:57,345
- Uh-huh.
- Why, you like it? Is it me?

37
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:59,353
Look, let me tell you
something, baby.

38
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:02,151
- There's only one thing I like on you.
- What's that?

39
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,385
- And that's me.
- Mmm.

40
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:08,954
- And I got you a little somethin'
for your last day too.
- What?

41
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:13,502
Hold on now. You'll find out tonight.
After a mind-blowing romantic dinner.

42
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:16,071
Date.

43
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,072
And excit...

44
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,472
Ah, hell, no, B
Don't tell me you forgot.

45
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:23,636
What? No? Of course not.
No I didn't forget I can't wait, baby.

46
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:26,510
I know it may not be as exciting
as that titanium thing you got.

47
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:29,881
- My supercharger. You saw it?
- Yeah. Whatever, baby just trust me. All right?

48
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,385
I just got
a 4:00 appointment

49
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:34,251

to pick up my hack license.

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,258
I'll be out of there by 4.30.
And then I'm all yours.

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,021

56
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:52,868

57
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,102
- No, no, no no cut.

58
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,338
- Is everybody here with appointment, okay?
- What?

59
00:04:57,446 --> 00:05:00,142
We take number like bakery.
Please go to the back.

60
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:03,582
I do not come here from Moscow
25 years for no bullshit.

61
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,416
Right here. Ticket.
Right there. Ticket.

62
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,422
Mm-hmm.

63
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,424
138?

64
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,725
Man.

65
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:31,357
Aw, he bought candles.

66
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,741
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

67
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:20,561
I'll make it up to you, baby.

68
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:50,493
Oh! Hey! What the hell
is your problem?

69
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:53,688
- Come on. Let's go.
- What is wrong with you, man?

70
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:57,824
Cabbie, I need to get to.
JFK in 15 minutes.

71
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,835
One hundred bucks,
I make it.

72
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:02,667
Whoo! Done.

73
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,372
You jumped in
the right cab today.

74
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,174
Yeah.

75
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,487
I don't usually stop for white guys.
My way of balancing the universe.

76
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,238
That's 14 minutes.

77
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,872
Buckle up for safety,
motherfu...

78
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:19,048
Actually, if I miss this flight,
it wouldn't be the end of the world.

79
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,710
Oh, no. Don't worry. We'll be able to speed up
once we hit the highway.

80
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,097
Come on, man.
What'd I do?

81
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,769
Hey, look here, Hugo Boss.
You might want to hold on.

82
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,810
Nine minute, 28 seconds.

83
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,783
Damn, I'm good.
You know... Damn.

84
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:37,122
I'm good I am good.

85
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,471
Don't you scratch them,
you idiot.

86
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,729
Where's Frank, man?
Where's your friend at, man?

87
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,857
He'll be here.
It's all right.

88
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,690
Where is this guy?

89
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,995
He'll be here.

90
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:55,772
This is the guy?

91
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,580
Yeah, that's him.

92
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,171
Okay. Let's do this.

93
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,251
- It's cool, right?
- Right. It's cool.

94
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,322
Come on.

95
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:24,090
They're in.

96
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,192
It's no trouble,
Frankie.

97
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,932
You're going to fifth floor,
number 22. Okay?

98
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:35,377
A- And don't try nothin'

99
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:38,277
This is an easy bust, Washburn.

100
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:40,873
Don't do anything fancy.
We clear?

101
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,418
Yeah Nothing fancy.
That's cool.

102
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,853
Stick to the plan.

103
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:29,627
- It's okay. It's good.
- Got the money?

104
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:35,328
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

105
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,703
I don't like it, okay?

106
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:39,833
You said these guys
are from Cuba like us.

107
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,639
- Tranquilo, chico.
- What's the matter?

108
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:45,840
- I'm not speaking to you, okay?
You're not from Cuba, okay?
- No, no, no.

109
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:49,476
Forget it. Forget it. Okay? You know what?
I don't like this. Okay, man? No.

110
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,817
- He don't like it.
- I don't like it. Okay, "mang"? I don't like it.

111
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:54,982
You don't like it?

112
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:57,652
Oh, do you no speak English?
I don't like it.

113
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:00,487
Read my lips. I smell something.
What do I smell, huh?

114
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:03,498
Huh? What do I smell?
Huh? I smell a setup.

115
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,795
What am I smelling here?
Huh? What do I smell?

116
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,336
Carnitas? Amigo? Pig!
Ah. Okay, "mang"?

117
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:10,338
- Don't do this. Don't do this.
- Okay?

118
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,204
You telling me
that you don't trust me?

119
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,278
That's what you're saying?

120
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,907
I'm only gonna
say this once, okay?

121
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:22,508
Your friend better come out
from behind that door. Okay?

122
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:26,851
Or I'm gonna put
a window... in him...

123
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:29,084
"mang"

124
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,614
Yeah.

125
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,519
Okay?

126
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,054
You're okay, man.
You're okay.

127
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:01,090
- What part of Cuba are you from?
- Huh?

128
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:03,352
- What part of Cuba are you from?
- Havana.

129
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,394
- Havana?
- Oh!

130
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,190
- We're from Havana!
- Ah! Cigar!

131
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,595
Oh, I love this guy.

132
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,897
The three of us from there.
We must be brothers, eh? Who's your mother?

133
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,732
- I'll tell you something. You guys are ever... Hey.
- That's enough.

134
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,708
- You guys are ever in Havana, you give me a call.
- Let's go.

135
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:23,974
We'll have some tequila, cerveza. You know?
Okay? Mi casco es su casco.

136
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,611
He funny.

137
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,689
What part? What part?

138
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,757
- Uh, you ask me where I'm from?
- Yeah. What part?

139
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:36,758
- What part am I from?
- Yep.

140
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,988
- Uh, what part of Havana?
- Yeah.

141
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:43,999
You know, on the...
Uh, I live around the corner of, uh

00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:46,797
uh, Castro Street.

143
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,427
You know?

144
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:49,835
So.

145
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,076
The show's over, pigs!

146
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,737
Aaah!

147
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:01,983
- Frank, are you all right?
- Goddamn it, Washburn!

148
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:08,316
How could there not be a Castro Street in Cuba?
That's insane.

149
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,325
- Shut up, Washburn.
- Right? Am I right?

150
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,361
Vàmonos! Vàmonos!

151
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,265
Hey! Stop!

152
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,234
They're gettin' away!
Come on. Let's go.

153
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,204
- You can't drive with your arm like that.
Give me the keys.
- No way.

154
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,206
- Come on!
- No, I insist.

155
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:27,242
Give me the keys!

156
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,312
Okay.

157
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:33,480
- Be careful, huh?
- Okay. All right.

158
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,552
Put my seat belt on.

159
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:39,281
Get my hands at 10:00 and 2:00
Okay, let's move the seat.

160
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,950
- Okay okay.
- Seat up. Like that. That's too close.

161
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,619
- Okay. Come on.
- Back more. Back more. Back more. Back more.

162
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:48,163
Back. Little back.

163
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,165
Back more.

164
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:53,725
That's good. All right. We'll have mirrors checked
and seat back. Can see side.

165
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:56,169
- Washburn, m-maybe...
- Ah!

166
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:59,538
I got it, dude! I got it, man.
Hand signal 'cause I'm comin' out.

167
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,543
- I'm comin' out.
- They're there. Go! Go!

168
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:04,512
Here we go. All right lets go.
Rock and roll, dude!

169
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:07,378
Washburn!

170
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,944
That's funny.

171
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,325
Get in here now.

172
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:56,355
I'm s... I'm sorry, Marta.
Lieutenant.

173
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,366
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

174
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,561
Andy.

175
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,434
I know this is hard for you,
especially coming from me.

176
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,474
It kind of feels weird
calling you lieutenant.

177
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:09,136
Well, you may not have to much longer.
I mean, look at this

178
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:12,613
$40,000 in damages, Andy.

179
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:14,479
This is two lawsuits here.

180
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,949
I...

181
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,782
And this. Have you seen
your face on the cover?

182
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:21,050
- Oh, there's a better picture than that.
- Oh, shut up.

183
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:25,218
L... I'm sorry, Andy.
But this is just not easy for me.

184
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:30,163
Look, you're a good cop,
but you're a terrible driver. What is it with you?

185
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:32,462
Hey... Everyone has
their weaknesses, okay?

186
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:36,562
Superman has Kryptonite.
Indiana Jones, snakes.

187
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:38,664
You know Whitney Houston
has Bobby Brown.

188
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,675
Or vice versa.

189
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:44,611
I... I try to make the department look good,
try to make you look good.

190
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,807
You look great,
by the way.

191
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,782
I'm not saying you don't.
You're not like...

192
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,785
- You look... Ah!
- Right. Okay. Good. Enough.

193
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,821
- You look like a lieutenant.
- Shh.

194
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:54,481
- Beautiful. You're hot.
- Shh.

195
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:57,116
- Professional.
- Three cars you totaled.

196
00:17:57,227 --> 00:18:00,196
Cop or no cop, that is 11 points on your license.
It's gone.

197
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:02,663
- No, don't take my license, please.
- It's gone.

198
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,996
Come on. Don't...

199
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,365
You're not gonna need it
for your next assignment.

200
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:25,787
I'm sorry, baby,
but that line at the T.L.C. was ridiculous.

201
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,119
- I cooked for hours.
- Come on. Look, look. All right.

202
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,192
Had wine, satin sheets.
I even bought candles.

203
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:33,057
Do you realize what I had to go through
to get that license?

204
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,791
- I won't be late.
- Yeah, well, you better not be

205
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:37,890
'Cause today I pulled out
all the stops.

206
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,902
Baby, I promise.
I promise I won't. For real.

207
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,904
5.00. At the restaurant.

208
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:47,306
All units, robbery in progress.

209
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,176
Manhattan Savings and Loan. Thirty-six
and Broadway. Suspects armed and dangerous.

210
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,345
Freeze! Police officer!
I'm gonna need your car for official...

211
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:20,504
I love you too. Bye.

212
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,545
Hi. Thirty-six and Broadway.
Manhattan Savings and Loan. And step on it.

213
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:26,673
- You know that's only two blocks...
- Yeah. Step on it. Thank you.

214
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,512
Okay.

215
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:49,395
Okay, that'll be 230
Hey, hey, hey!

216
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,201
Hey, I'm not beat, man.

217
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:54,071
Now you owe me five
because I had to chase...

218
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:56,304
Get out of the way!
Freeze!

219
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,775
- You! We got a hot pursuit. Go.
- Do what?

220
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:03,478
- You still owe me five bucks.
- Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

221
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,383
I'm commandeering your vehicle.
Follow that car.

222
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:08,151
Don't worry about speed limits,
streetlights... nothin' You're with me.

223
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:10,226
Man.

224
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:15,131
All right.
But I'm still runnin' this meter.

225
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:32,014
Yo!

226
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:34,583
Hold this for me.

227
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:37,278
Hang on.

228
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:34,869
Whoa! Yo, man.
Be careful with that.

229
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:36,878
Careful don't bag the bad guys.
Here's the plan.

230
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,346
Fake like you're gonna go left,
then go right. Okay?

231
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,883
I'll lay a little suppressing fire down
from "pistolita" Hey.

00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:48,189
- Oh, my goodness. Did you just...

00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,725
Drive the car. Drive. Don't look at me.
Look at the road.

00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:07,072

235
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:11,008

00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:58,354
- All right. Let's do this thing, baby. Get my burn on.

245
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,259

I know you ain't talking to me.

246
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,766
- Shot my...
- There's nowhere to run.

247
00:23:10,073 --> 00:23:12,303
Damn.

248
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:20,741
Oh!

255
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,789
- Hey!

256
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:10,832
- Who is gonna pay for that?
- Hey. See this?

257
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:13,869
This is a badge, okay? That means
you're not allowed to scream at me.

258
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:17,706
Come on, now. Give me the badge.

259
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:20,241

263
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,681
Be cool, huh? I had to flip and pull this
out of my ankle holster.

264
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,885
- Now, give me that and shush.
- Okay. Be cool.

265
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:39,586

00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:46,166
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, now what?
- Uh...

268
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,500
How you like it being pointed at you?
I'm not givin' nothin' back.

269
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:51,903
Quick. Gimme, gimme.
Gimme it.

270
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:54,704
- Drop your weapon and put your hands in the air.
- Ooh.

271
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,748
- Freeze!
- It's okay I'm a police officer.

272
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:03,216
- Okay, slowly show me your badge.
- Uh, okay.

273
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,581
- Give me the badge.
- No.

274
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:06,279
- Give me the badge.
- No.

275
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:09,085
Throw it over here.

276
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:11,490
Oh.

277
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:15,690
I can't.
She's got it.

278
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:18,892
- Freeze!
- Wai-Wait.

279
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:23,871
I said freeze scum... Washburn. Washburn.

280
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,874
He's such a loser.

281
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:30,535
Is he in there?

282
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:32,944
Washburn.

283
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:40,145
Washburn. You took a cab
to a bank robbery?

284
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:42,952
- You-You thought that was okay?
- Well, y-yeah.

285
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:46,028
Yeah I was the closest
to the scene.

286
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,222
If you hadn't of taken my wheels,
I would've nailed 'em.

287
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:51,732
I didn't take your wheels.
You drove your wheels through a bodega

288
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,495
and you killed.
Detective Manuel's parrot.

289
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:57,334
Det Manuel knew what he was risking
when he took the parrot on the stakeout.

290
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,738
- I can't believe you.
- So ridiculous.

291
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:04,142
Of all pets, I mean. It's the one that talks.

292
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:07,444
- What is that smell?
- L-I know I let you down.

293
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,245
- Mm-hmm.
- So, see what's happening?

294
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:13,516
- Mm-mmm.
- You're getting emotional
and taking it way too personally.

295
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,784
- Personally?
- Yeah.

296
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,360
I'm your lieutenant.
Of course I'm pissed off.

297
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:20,588
Come on, Marta.
That's not what I'm talking about.

298
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:24,496
You know what I'm talking about here.
I'm talking about... us.

299
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,500
- Us.
- What?

300
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:30,698
- Us I'm talking about us.
- You think.

301
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:32,604
- Shh.
- that I and you...

302
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,836
I got it. Got that.
I'm with you.

303
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:39,073
What? Mm-hmm.

304
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,514
Okay. Thank you.
I'll be right there.

305
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,451
The FBI's here.

306
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:50,890
I'm gonna do something
to you later.

307
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,018
Mm-hmm.

308
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,700
Washburn.

309
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,039
So, did you pay by the mile, or is there a flat rate
for chasing bank robbers?

310
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,979
Quiet.

311
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:18,213
Quiet.
Please give your attention to Agent Mullins.

312
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:22,155
FBI Armed Robbery Unit.

313
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:26,058
Thank you it's tape of this morning's robbery.
Watch close.

314
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:29,962
It goes by pretty fast.

315
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:35,702
Four cameras.
Four perfect shots.

316
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:39,741
In and out in 35 seconds.
Lieutenant, you have the witnesses' statements.

317
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:43,073
Miss Williams,
I'm Lieutenant Robbins.

318
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:46,615
This is Agent Mullins with the FBI
We want to ask you a few questions.

319
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:50,277
- Am I under arrest?
- Well, no.

320
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:52,854
Then I ain't answering no questions
until somebody tells me

321
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:55,788
who is paying for the damage on my cab
and when do I get it back?

322
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:58,520
Miss Williams, I'm afraid your vehicle's
physical evidence now.

323
00:27:58,628 --> 00:28:02,621
- We have to run ballistics tests...
- Ballistics tests? On what?

324
00:28:02,732 --> 00:28:04,666
We already know
who shot my cab.

325
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,235
It was that stupid idiot right there
with that dumb look on his face.

326
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:10,203
That's not fair.
Agent Mullins wasn't even on the scene.

327
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,570
- I was talkin' about you.
- Me?

328
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:15,075
You shot my back window out.
You could've shot me.

329
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:18,079
- You don't talk to me like that.
- I'll talk however I want.

330
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:20,308
- Get him out.
- Take his stinkin' ass out of here.

331
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:23,874
- All right, all right I'm sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

332
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:27,615
- I'm sorry.
- That is the FBI in there. You need to calm down.

333
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:29,554
Somebody better talk to him.

334
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:33,288
Sorry 'bout that, dude, um, sir.
The adrenaline's still pumping.

335
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,261
You know what I'm saying?
Had a crazy morning.

336
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,662
I'm a little out of line,
and I apologize.

337
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:40,759
Detective Washburn,
you were the first one on the scene, correct?

338
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,997
Yes, I was.
I was the first one on the scene.

339
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:47,906
My first instinct is to give you a shot
at leading this investigation.

340
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,969
- However, I spoke with your lieutenant.
You're off the case.

341
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:56,146
- Permanently.
- What?

342
00:28:56,252 --> 00:29:00,154
Nice meeting you.

343
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:02,690
I know.

344
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,430
Y... Marta, you can't...
Lieutenant.

345
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:15,003
- You can't...
- Enough.

346
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:18,471
Now, go clock in.
You're late for your shift.

347
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:25,372
I already told you everything I know.

348
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:30,817
You can't hold me.
Now, I want my cab.

349
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,617
- Says here you did a year in juvenile hall.
- That's supposed to be sealed.

350
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:38,490
Joyriding. Graduated to reckless driving,
fleeing the scene of an accident...

351
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:41,529
look at this... moving violation,
moving violation, moving violation.

352
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:45,727
- Come on. Everybody got a few tickets.
- Not 75

353
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:49,168
And not on a bicycle,
Miss Williams.

354
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:52,400
Officers at the front desk will give you
the forms you need to fill out.

355
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:55,705
As far as your car's concerned, you'll get that back
when we're done. Two weeks, maybe longer.

356
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:59,338
Two weeks? Come on, man.
This is bullshit.

357
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,916
That's not just my car.
That is my job.

358
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:05,715
Wh-What am I supposed to do?
Give people piggyback rides to Newark Airport?

359
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:09,780
One more question.

360
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,383
Did you ever get close enough
to see the guy driving the car?

361
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:17,566
No, sir.

362
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:21,262
All I saw was their taillights.

363
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:25,402
Can I go now?

364
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:29,069
- Here we go again.
Didn't I say 5.00? Where are you?
- Jesse.

365
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:32,011
I feel like a damn fool, B,
thinking you'd actually be here on time.

366
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:36,778
- I tried.
- No, no, no no I'm tired of hearing excuses, okay?

367
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:40,185
I'm sittin' in my cab, right?
All of a sudden out of nowhere, this guy jumps...

368
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:44,248
Hello? Baby?
Jesse?

369
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,057
What the hell
could be so damn important?

370
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:01,142
- Freakin' day I had.
- Hey. Miss Williams.

371
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:03,541
- You again.
- Hey, hey, hey.

372
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:05,113
- Go ahead. Talk.
- I just wanna talk.

373
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:07,478
- Talk then.
- I can get you your cab back.

374
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:11,782
Come on.

375
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:14,185
Come on.

376
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,225
You gotta help me first.

377
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:19,089
Okay? Just hear me out.

378
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,331
They got five detectives on this case.
We gotta catch these guys first.

379
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:28,062
All I got to go on is
the MO, modus operandi.

380
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,297
- That's police jargon for...
- I know what it means.

381
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:33,842
- It's not police jargon. It's Latin.
- Right. Whatever. It's both.

382
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:37,572
They were pretty quick though.
They were in and out in, like, under a minute.

383
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,309
That's real pros. Witnesses
said they're either Spanish or Italian.

384
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,715
Nah, I think they're Brazilian.
They were speaking Portuguese.

385
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,287
- You sure?
- Confia em mim.

386
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:50,018
My first job was delivering food at...

387
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:53,425
Brazilian.
This is huge.

388
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:56,157
Hey, why are we not
doing this at the station?

389
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:59,598
Sometimes a good cop's got to bend the rules
so that laws don't get broken.

390
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:02,865
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not afraid to live outside the law.

391
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:05,873
You living outside of your mind.
That's where you live.

392
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:09,274
Well, the reports here say
that the man driving was about 5'10"

393
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:14,042
No no, no, no, no.
If that was a man, so am I

394
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:18,280
She looked like a model.
Tan, blondish hair.

395
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,685
All right. As I was saying.
It was a woman driving.

396
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,524
- and she was driving a Mercedes... an Au...
- No.

397
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:30,759
- Mm-mmm. No, no, no.
- She was driving... Definitely you saw her driving.

398
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:34,358
- a BMW?
- Right.

399
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:39,497
- Yeah, but not just a BMW. It was a 760
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:43,135
- But the engine sounded lighter.
- Light, yeah.

401
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:47,204
Now, with that much torque, she had to have
an inboard torsion damper system

402
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:51,184
with a push rod bell crank
and double wishbone arrangement.

403
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:54,381
Wait a minute.
You shot her tire out, didn't you?

404
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,516
Yeah. Standard OP

405
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:59,594
- That's police jargon for...
- But she kept on going

406
00:32:59,695 --> 00:33:02,425
'cause she had run flats.

407
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:07,662
Yeah, that's what I thought.
She had "runs" flats on.

408
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,103
Armored tires. They seal themselves
with a gel when they're punctured.

409
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:14,176
Now, they're good,
but they only go for about 50 miles.

410
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:17,575
So, if she wants to drive that car again,
she's gonna have to get a new tire.

411
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,583
And there's only one place to get that tire
around here Lou's Garage in Secaucus.

412
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:26,177
- What are we waiting for? Let's hit it. Take my ride.
- All right.

413
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:30,224
There's my baby, right there.

414
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:32,590
- This is your unmarked car?
- We found her.

415
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:37,826
A Daewoo? Man, I know people.
I can't be seen in this thing.

416
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:42,097
Tsk. Open the door.
I don't wanna get Daewoo on my hands.

417
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:50,267
Buckle up for safety, everybody.
Hard to do it with my holster on.

418
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:53,007
Okay, we're good.

419
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,175
Good, wipers work
10:00 and 2:00

420
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,118
Mirrors work.
And here we go.

421
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:02,054
Oh, damn.

422
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:04,785
- Whoa! Sheesh, man.
- Little ding. Little ding.

423
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:08,261
- That's why you got bumpers.
- Can't you... What the hell?

424
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:11,424
- You trying to kill me?
- I'm not a perfect driving robot.

425
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:14,935
- I know. Oh! What are you doing?
- Here comes Junior.

426
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:18,666
- Here comes Junior.
- You can't... Oh, shit! Wait! Stop stop stop.

427
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:22,904
What the hell are you trying to do,
a 78-point turn?

428
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:26,641
- Can you get us out of this spot?
- Yes.

429
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:30,184
Everyone just chill out.
Be real cool about it.

430
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:31,981
God... damn!

431
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:35,284
Now, I'm turning the wheel.
Turning the wheel.

432
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:38,451
- Oh, my God! Wait wait.
- Shh. Everyone be cool.

433
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:40,688
No. Stop.

434
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:47,492
What? What? What do you...
What do you want?

435
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:51,034
- What's the problem here?
- Get over there.

436
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,598
- I got... I got shotgun.
- Get your ass over there.

437
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,338
You got insurance?
'Cause that's what I'm gonna need.

438
00:34:57,446 --> 00:35:01,405
Daggone whiplash.
You got a driver's license?

439
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,508
Let me get my belt on.

440
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:08,056
Who the hell gave you a driver's license?
That's what I wanna know.

441
00:35:10,593 --> 00:35:13,221
Okay, after I show you this place,
I'm gonna get my cab back?

442
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:15,229
- Deal.
- 'Cause I don't really trust you.

443
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:20,132
Soon as I know this is the place,
we'll go back to the station, I'll get your cab back.

444
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:25,907
- This is it?
- Yep.

445
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:28,977
If they gettin' that car fixed,
they-they gotta come here.

446
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,648
- So, what now?
- We wait.

447
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:58,832
You can open your eyes now.
I'm done.

448
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:02,399
You didn't see my nads, did you?

449
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:09,782
Man.

450
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:14,083
So, you got guy problems, huh?
Overheard you and your man on the phone.

451
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:17,317
Want a little bit
of wisdom from the man side?

452
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:20,589
I'll give it to you.

453
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:23,995
Men are like cats, you know?

454
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,226
Sure, we'll play with
the ball of yarn

455
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:29,793
unless you want us
to play with the ball of yarn.

456
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:33,238
Trick is,
hide the ball of yarn.

457
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:41,441
Don't hide it where you can't find it,
you know?

458
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,348
"Hey, what's the ball of yarn
doin' in the fridge?"

459
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,444
Whatever.
You know what I'm saying?

460
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:54,622
You know, cops are supposed
to talk to each other on stakeouts.

461
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,425
It helps the mission
go by faster.

462
00:36:56,532 --> 00:36:59,990
- Would you please shut up?
- Okay. That's cool.

463
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:04,232
You wanna be quiet? That's cool.
No room for chitchat. That's fine.

464
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,467
I don't care I don't need...
I don't need to talk.

465
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:09,476
We'll just sit here
in silence.

466
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:18,317
So, are you into cars, or...
I mean, what got you into cars?

467
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,255
I mean, were you always into them?
Did you just, like, stumble upon them?

468
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:25,485
Damn. My grandpa.

469
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:28,529
- Okay?
- Yeah.

470
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,359
W- What?
He loved driving, or...

471
00:37:30,466 --> 00:37:35,597
Yeah. He was a mechanic.
Taught me everything I know.

472
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,468
We used to live
next to a track.

473
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:40,701
You used to go to the track all day?
That's fun.

474
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:45,007
No. We didn't really go that much.
I mean, we went to a couple races.

475
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:48,311
But mostly, we would just listen
to the races together.

476
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,443
I could hear those cars.
Hear those engines.

477
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:54,681
I got good
l- I got to the point where.

478
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,850
I could tell who won the race
without even seeing it.

479
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,589
- Yeah. Driving NASCAR. That's my dream.
- Wow.

480
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:06,498
Wait. Let me ask you something.
Why would you take a taxi to a bank robbery?

481
00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:08,729
I mean,
I've never seen that.

482
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:10,964
I got in a wreck in my last gig.

483
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:13,974
Bad guys got away.
My lieutenant flipped out.

484
00:38:14,076 --> 00:38:17,239
Put me back on the beat.
No vehicle.

485
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:19,507
Aw, man.

486
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:23,346
What makes it worse,
me and my lieutenant used to date.

487
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:26,421
- Yeah. We went to Academy together.
- Okay.

488
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:29,980
She got promoted.
I didn't.

489
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:32,560
You can cut the sexual tension
with a knife.

490
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:39,096
Shh! Look.

491
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:43,036
There they are.

492
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:46,266
Oh, man. Yep.
That's her.

493
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,275
That's her.

494
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:54,171
- Party time.
- Hey. So-So, what we gonna do now?

495
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:56,410
- I mean, we gonna call it in, right?
- Call it in?

496
00:38:56,518 --> 00:38:59,783
By the time we get backup, that soup will be cold.
We go in now, baby. Now.

497
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:15,360
Shoot. Oh, my God.

498
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,201
Daewoo, please. I'm sorry.
I take back everything I said. Start for me.

499
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,417
Hi. Um, I'm not actually with him.
He's...

500
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:46,564
- You okay?
- Yeah.

501
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:50,069
Damn.

502
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:10,655
- What are they saying?
- The redhead is saying
she doesn't wanna kill a cop.

503
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:13,387
If we just play it cool,
then they'll leave us here tied up.

504
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,487
Okay okay I'll play it cool.
Play it real cool.

505
00:40:16,598 --> 00:40:19,590
Okay. Hey,
what was that wink for?

506
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:23,797
- Shh. Hey, trust me.
- No, no, no, no, no, man. What was that about?

507
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:25,430
- Shh. Trust me. Trust me.
- Trust you?

508
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,202
- Yeah.
- Trust you? Hell no. Uh-uh. No way.

509
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,608
No, no, no. Uh-uh.
Hey. Excuse me.

510
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:33,203
Excuse me.

511
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:37,046
Excuse me. Hey. Excuse me.
Don't mean to interrupt.

512
00:40:37,152 --> 00:40:39,245
He's gonna do something.
He just winked at me.

513
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,322
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

514
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:44,392
- Yeah.
- I got a problem gettin' shot. Did you frisk him?

515
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:48,395
- Come on.
- Frisk his ass again.
He got at least one more gun on him.

516
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:50,727
- Cavity-search him.
- I do not I swear.

517
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:54,825
He got a gun, and he's gonna use it.
He's crazy.

518
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:56,632
- Whose side are you on?
- Mine.

519
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:03,908
Okay. You wanna strip search? Huh?
Is that what you want? Nothing up my sleeve here.

520
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:06,537
You wanna check my shoes there?
Ha!

521
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:08,138
Go!

522
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:17,091
All right,
you're all under...

523
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:22,558
Man, you're more dangerous
than they are.

524
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,025
Hey. What are you doing, man?

525
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:31,104
I'm evening
the playing field.

526
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:35,336
That's flammable gas. They won't be able to shoot.
This whole place will blow.

527
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:39,346
Man, we still
in this place, you jackass.

528
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:41,279
Turn that off,
and let's wait for the cops to come.

529
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:44,614
The real cops.

530
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,621
Oh, my G...

531
00:41:47,723 --> 00:41:50,351
- Oh.
- Aw, man.

532
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:55,556
You smell that, ladies?
That's nitrous. One shot and boom!

533
00:41:55,664 --> 00:42:01,193
Now, you wanna handle this
hand to hand, man to... chick?

534
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:04,568
Then we'll go home.

535
00:42:04,673 --> 00:42:06,800
Hello. Hello?

536
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:08,899
Ace Dumbtura, they're gone.

537
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,442
They're gone.

538
00:42:12,547 --> 00:42:15,175
Stay down. Stay down.
They're not there.

539
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,821
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Oh, damn.

540
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:24,255
This thing's jammed.

541
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,152
- Oh, man.
- Ohh.

542
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:31,664
Dumb ass.

543
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,774
You can't... You can't die
from nitrous oxide can you?

544
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:43,310
It's laughing gas, stupid.

545
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:47,041
I hate you, man.

546
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,845
- What's that?
- I hate your freakin' guts.

547
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:54,411
- Ow.
- You got to be the dumbest cop I've met.

548
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:01,492
- We gotta go. We gotta get out.
- Okay.

549
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:03,564
- We gotta get out.
- All right. Okay. Open the door.

550
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,361
Open the door, man.
Move.

551
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:13,872
You're stupid. All you had to do
was turn the freakin' knob.

552
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:18,173
Your car is on fire.

553
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,180
- No. Come on.
- Daewoo can't take a little heat?

554
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:23,513
Drop the weapon!

555
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:25,711
- Freeze!
- Oh.

556
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,618
Okay. This does not look good.

557
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:30,657
Here's the plan, all right?
Okay, when he comes by...

558
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:39,190
Or that. Hey! Hey!
Wait for me! Belle! Belle, wait up!

559
00:43:39,301 --> 00:43:43,237
They've gone around the back side
of this building. We need to go.

560
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:49,976
I tell you what we do.
We go back to the station and search the files...

561
00:43:50,078 --> 00:43:53,536
No, no... No. Hell no.
We ain't goin' nowhere.

562
00:43:53,648 --> 00:43:57,448
You're comin' back to my house
with me to tell my boyfriend where I was

563
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,850
'Cause I had a man
when I went to work today.

564
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:02,583
Okay. That's the least.
I can do.

565
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:06,991
Damn straight. The most you could do
would be to get my cab back.

566
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:11,054
You'll get your cab back
when I catch these guys... girls, women.

567
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:13,634
Not before.

568
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:17,964
I'm getting a little seasick.

569
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:25,578
Swallowed it.

570
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,138
I don't know if this is gonna work,
so just hurry up and show him your badge, okay?

571
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:31,242
Because he's sensitive,
and he is pissed off.

572
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:33,821
All right. I got your back right here.
I owe you one.

573
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:37,289
What the hell?

574
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:39,519
Jesse. Baby, you home?

575
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,131
- Wait I can explain I was with this guy all night.
- Oh, really?

576
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:48,066
Then go home with him, Belle.
I'm tired of hearing your apologies.

577
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,071
First of all, don't take that tone with me.
I ain't apologizing.

578
00:44:51,173 --> 00:44:53,698
Don't you be taking that tone.
I've been waiting here all night.

579
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:56,777
Hey, hey, hey I got this.
I can handle this. All right?

580
00:44:56,878 --> 00:45:01,178
I can totally handle this.
What's up, bro? How you doin', man?

581
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:03,217
Yeah.

582
00:45:05,253 --> 00:45:07,881
Here's the dilly, yo I know it seems weird
your girl hanging out

583
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:10,423
with the skinny,
pretty good-looking white dude.

584
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:12,390
But, hey,
I'm a cop.

585
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:14,962
The name's Detective Washburn.

586
00:45:15,063 --> 00:45:19,762
- At least let me explain.
- Oh, no. Not again.

587
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:22,393
He's gonna give it back, right?

588
00:45:26,575 --> 00:45:28,475
What's that sound?

589
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:32,445
Blowtorch.

590
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:36,847
Blo-Blo... Blowtorch.
Hey, Jesse.

591
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:39,318
Thank you.
Can I have my...

592
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:42,015
- At least let me explain.
- Ow. Man.

593
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:44,683
Damn!

594
00:45:44,793 --> 00:45:46,761
Man.

595
00:45:48,296 --> 00:45:51,265
- Always wanted a money clip.
- What the hell was that?

596
00:45:51,366 --> 00:45:54,824
- It was my badge.
- You know what? Fine.

597
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:57,097
Forget it.
I'm just gonna let him cool off.

598
00:45:57,205 --> 00:46:00,368
- Hey, wait up.
- I don't know you for seven hours, I lose my cab

599
00:46:00,475 --> 00:46:02,943
my boyfriend
and my apartment.

600
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:04,944
- You battin' a thousand, you know?
- Yeah.

601
00:46:05,046 --> 00:46:08,174
I mean, it's not enough you screw up
your own life, huh? This your place?

602
00:46:08,283 --> 00:46:10,682
No I figured we'd stop here,
get something to eat.

603
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,982
You actually have a girlfriend?

604
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:18,048
Ma!

605
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:19,353
- Ma.
- Sweetheart.

606
00:46:19,461 --> 00:46:23,227
I love you I love you I love you.

607
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:25,561
Ma, I brought company.

608
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,066
- Oh.
- Hi.

609
00:46:27,168 --> 00:46:30,296
Nice catch.
Jungle fever.

610
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:34,136
- You know me.
- Excuse me.

611
00:46:34,242 --> 00:46:37,837
I'm not his girlfriend.
I ain't even his friend.

612
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,517
Mom, uh, Belle here
is a cabdriver

613
00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:45,552
and she witnessed a bank robbery...

614
00:46:45,654 --> 00:46:49,488
- She needs a place to stay.
- Get in here! Come in.

615
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:52,685
Come in.

616
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:59,026
Oh, you must be starving.

617
00:46:59,134 --> 00:47:04,766
I have got the number of a joint

618
00:47:04,873 --> 00:47:07,774
that makes
a General Tso's chicken...

619
00:47:07,876 --> 00:47:12,575
It'll knock you
on your goddamn ass.

620
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:15,479
- Whoo!
- Your mom's drunk, huh?

621
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,347
Always.

622
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:26,730
Where's my Daewoo?

623
00:47:27,898 --> 00:47:29,832
Andy...

624
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,367
- did you do something to my car?
- Don't.

625
00:47:31,468 --> 00:47:34,926
- You busted.
- Andy.

626
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,100
Look at me, darling. You didn't drive through
another bodega, did you?

627
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:42,007
- That was you?
- What? What?

628
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:45,775
That was you
on the cover of the post.

629
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:48,181
- You killed that parrot.
- No.

630
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:50,810
Mom, what'd I tell you about
talking official police business, all right?

631
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:55,358
- Sorry.
- He had the mustache.
I didn't recognize you at first.

632
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:59,395
See...
They took his license away.

633
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:01,896
There was the third car that he totaled.
He even wrecked

634
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:04,832
one of those big armored machines,
you know, with the battering ram?

635
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:07,301
Who the hell gave him
one of those?

636
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:12,307
He just mowed down three mailboxes like that.
That's a federal offense.

637
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:18,211
- Mom.
- Well, Andy is not a really strong driver.

638
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:20,840
See, he had a really bad
experience when, uh...

639
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:22,680
he had his first
driving lesson.

640
00:48:22,786 --> 00:48:24,686
Driving lesson?
You call that a driving lesson?

641
00:48:24,788 --> 00:48:27,916
- Mmm. Yes.
- Dad let go of the wheel and said

642
00:48:28,025 --> 00:48:29,890
"You better steer or else
you're going to kill the whole family"

643
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:31,985
Yeah. It was good for you.

644
00:48:32,096 --> 00:48:34,064
- We were going 90 I was six.
- That's right.

645
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,224
- And that's the way he taught you to swim.
- I can't swim either.

646
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:40,861
- Well...
- Can we drop it?

647
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:44,668
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay, Mom. Lock it.

648
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:47,403
Down your...
Down your brassiere it goes.

649
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:56,043
Oh. Mommy's getting
the spins.

650
00:48:56,153 --> 00:48:59,520
Whoo. That's it for me.

651
00:48:59,623 --> 00:49:01,853
- That's it.
- That's it for the kid.

652
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:05,622
Why don't you...
Take good care of this little girl.

653
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:08,027
- Daddy will be so proud of you.
- Mommy. Thank you. Come on.

654
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:10,123
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.

655
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,134
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, nice to meet you too.

656
00:49:12,236 --> 00:49:15,535
- Yes yes.
- Oh, she'll be back.

657
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:17,903
- Where's my-my drink?
- There it is.

658
00:49:18,008 --> 00:49:21,375
Don't forget that.
Mom, the bedroom's that way.

659
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:26,142
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Or are you just getting the blender?

660
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,880
- Oh, yeah.
- That's a... That's a 38-ounce blender.

661
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,456
You know, it is
getting late.

662
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:36,753
Do you wanna just crash at my place
until your dude cools off?

663
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,952
Like I have a choice.

664
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:51,315
Tsk. Stop playing.
You live next door to your moms?

665
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:54,114
Makes her feel safe.

666
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:59,192
She must not've
seen you in action, huh?

667
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:05,288
Oh, God, it feels good to lay down.

668
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,705
Good night.

669
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:20,246
What kind of grown-ass man
lives 10 feet away from his mama?

670
00:50:20,347 --> 00:50:23,316
I wouldn't talk so much.

671
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:26,386
Isabelle "Precious" Williams.

672
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:29,945
- Who told you about my name?
- It's in your record.

673
00:50:30,057 --> 00:50:32,582
Precious.
My. Precious.

674
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:36,891
Go ahead. Say it again.
Say it again, see what happens I dare you.

675
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:49,709
Precious.

676
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:02,146
Hey, you know, I was just thinking.
I remembered something.

677
00:51:02,256 --> 00:51:07,216
The girls kept saying over and over again
to each other, "Nice 'dua rateeraros."

678
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:11,988
Mais duas retiradas?

679
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:13,999
Yeah. That's what they said.

680
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:17,559
That means,
"Two more withdrawals"

681
00:51:17,671 --> 00:51:20,697
I want five cars on 14th and Broadway waitin',
and I want 'em now.

682
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,233
- Hey, I've made a major break...
- Get out.

683
00:51:25,339 --> 00:51:27,466
- I made a major break in the case.
- Oh, really?

684
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:30,544
Does that explain why they found a car
registered to your mom.

685
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:32,737
- on fire in front of a shot-up...
- That's not important right now.

686
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:35,144
- What's important is
they're gonna rob another bank.
- First Financial

687
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:39,276
at Leonard and Church and they hit
two minutes ago and they're still inside.

688
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:41,377
So, I am busy.
Now, sit down and shut up.

689
00:51:43,023 --> 00:51:45,992
Damn, man.

690
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:49,620
Car 10-70. Suspects are still in the bank.

691
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:53,166
- How would you like me to proceed? Over.
- Backup units are on their way.

692
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:56,930
- Do not let them leave.
- I don't think that's sexual tension
between you two.

693
00:51:57,037 --> 00:52:00,939
I think that is genuine tension.
Like, she-gonna-fire-your-ass tension.

694
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:03,339
I can't stand this.
You know what's gonna happen?

695
00:52:03,444 --> 00:52:06,174
They're gonna catch them,
and we're gonna miss the whole thing.

696
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,808
- Please. Ain't no cop gonna catch that woman.
- Oh, yeah, and you can, right?

697
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:14,479
If I had my taxi.

698
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:16,579
Right away.

699
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:19,750
And keep me informed.

700
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,125
Let's take a walk.

701
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:32,897
Find Washburn. Now.

702
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:36,876
Eddie B

703
00:52:36,977 --> 00:52:38,604
"Washtub"

704
00:52:38,712 --> 00:52:40,976
Hey, uh, I'm gonna need your help, man.
I gotta get the...

705
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:43,276
- The Crown Vic.
- Crown Vic.

706
00:52:43,384 --> 00:52:46,046
Here. All I need are the signatures
of the two officers, man.

707
00:52:46,153 --> 00:52:49,782
Two. Perfect. One, two.
You know Lieutenant Williams, right?

708
00:52:51,392 --> 00:52:54,293
- Uh...
- Williams from SWAT?

709
00:52:54,395 --> 00:52:57,330
- Oh oh.
- She's a jujitsu master.

710
00:52:57,431 --> 00:52:59,296
Really?

711
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,800
She has her own dojo.

712
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:03,802
- Oh. Wow.
- You have any flyers?

713
00:53:03,904 --> 00:53:06,839
No. Sure don't.

714
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,067
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

715
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:11,167
You gotta Friendster me, man.
I want a flyer.

716
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:13,337
- Hey, man. Got the, uh...
- Here you go.

717
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:16,507
Aha. Thanks, man.

718
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:25,855
Hold it right there.

719
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,662
Shots fired. Shots fired!
Officer needs assistance.

720
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:39,671
Suspects are headed north on. Third Avenue
towards the Queensboro Bridge.

721
00:53:39,773 --> 00:53:41,741
What?

722
00:53:41,842 --> 00:53:44,276
What are you doin'? We're gonna lose her.
Come on. Run lights.

723
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:46,369
- What are you doin'?
- Why would you take the East Side?

724
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,846
The Queensboro would be
a parking lot.

725
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:50,780
Oh, you bein' slick.
You headin' west.

726
00:53:52,653 --> 00:53:55,087
You're drivin' the speed limit, okay?
You're driving the speed limit.

727
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:57,419
- We're not gonna catch...
- Oh, you think you slick, don't you?

728
00:53:57,524 --> 00:54:01,187
You know 68th'll be gridlocked
'cause Hunter College's semester just started.

729
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:04,420
Unless you gonna drive
through the damn school.

730
00:54:05,966 --> 00:54:09,595
Of course. She gonna take Fifth.
Hell, yeah.

731
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:12,263
There's plenty of room to maneuver
down the Museum Mile...

732
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:16,309
and I know your crazy ass ain't scared
to get up on that sidewalk.

733
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,641
That's what I would do.

734
00:54:19,747 --> 00:54:21,715
Now, if I'm right...

735
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:23,976
which I believe.
I am...

736
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:25,949
she gonna come out
right

737
00:54:26,053 --> 00:54:28,453
about here!

738
00:54:29,656 --> 00:54:30,714
Oh!

739
00:54:32,926 --> 00:54:33,620
Ooh!

740
00:54:36,997 --> 00:54:39,090
- Ooh!
- Come on. Let's go! Get her!

741
00:54:59,553 --> 00:55:02,579
I told you... too much torque, grandma!

742
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:08,823
Watch this.

743
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:16,827
Whoo!

744
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:22,800
Pull over! Police!

745
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,844
Pull over the car!
Pull over right now!

746
00:55:24,945 --> 00:55:28,437
- What?
- My badge.

747
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,310
Now, pull over.
This means something.

748
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,320
It's your last chance.
Come on.

749
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:44,527
Okay. You tryin' to dent me?
Not gonna happen.

750
00:55:55,976 --> 00:55:58,137
Damn.

751
00:56:08,822 --> 00:56:09,379
Whoa!

752
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:14,249
We're gonna kaboom...

753
00:56:23,303 --> 00:56:25,237
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

754
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,210
Ha-ha!

755
00:56:32,312 --> 00:56:34,439
Whoo!

756
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:54,098
- Oh...
- Shit.

757
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:01,969
Ah!

758
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,950
Aw.

759
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:16,079
Damn I was
on her ass too.

760
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,489
Let me just...

761
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:28,693
No B.M.W.'s have come through here.

762
00:58:28,795 --> 00:58:31,491
A red BMW
cannot disappear twice.

763
00:58:31,598 --> 00:58:34,396
Uh, I got a blue Beemer
on Morningside Avenue.

764
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:37,561
Good I'll take it.

765
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:54,081
Uh...
License and registration?

766
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,930
I'm gonna need you
to pop the trunk for me.

767
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:18,500
I gotta open it myself.
It's busted.

768
00:59:18,612 --> 00:59:21,103
Shit.

769
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:28,113
Uh, pardon me, miss.

770
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:36,027
Thank you.

771
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,298
Uh, could you open the case?

772
00:59:44,971 --> 00:59:46,939
Sure.

773
00:59:50,343 --> 00:59:52,311
Here.

774
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:00,784
You ladies have a nice day.

775
01:00:00,887 --> 01:00:04,983
Miss Williams, give me your license.
I'm taking it away from you.

776
01:00:05,092 --> 01:00:06,992
- What?
- You heard me.

777
01:00:07,094 --> 01:00:09,619
You're not driving
a taxi again. Let's go.

778
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:11,960
But I made her
pursue that car.

779
01:00:12,065 --> 01:00:14,226
- Really?
- Hello?

780
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:18,464
Well, her taxicab is in
violation of 27 vehicle codes.

781
01:00:18,572 --> 01:00:20,472
Did you make her do that too?

782
01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:25,602
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.

783
01:00:25,712 --> 01:00:29,580
- I, uh, ordered the modifications top to bottom.
- Top to bottom.

784
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:31,674
- Weeks ago.
- Mmm.

785
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:35,955
So there.

786
01:00:36,056 --> 01:00:38,320
What kind of car is it?

787
01:00:39,426 --> 01:00:43,419
- Ford.
- Ford. What model?

788
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:48,966
Crown... Crown... Vic...

789
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:51,333
- Ner-r-rvous...
- Excuse me?

790
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,170
"Roundville"

791
01:00:56,276 --> 01:00:59,268
You're an idiot.
Give me... Give me the license.

792
01:00:59,379 --> 01:01:02,871
- Crown Victoria.
- I don't know what that means.

793
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:06,544
Come on.

794
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:08,450
- Give...
- Well, but, see, it looks... It's the picture...

795
01:01:08,555 --> 01:01:10,955
- It's actually a nice...
- Marta...

796
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:13,821
- "Lieutenant"
- All she's tryin' to do is help, okay?
Just do something?

797
01:01:13,927 --> 01:01:17,419
- No.
- I stopped three BMW's this morning.

798
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:20,694
Let's take Miss Williams down so she can hear
the officer's testimony. Let's go.

799
01:01:20,801 --> 01:01:23,702
Let's go.

800
01:01:23,804 --> 01:01:25,704
- Let's go.
- Blue Beemer.

801
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:28,832
- This chick didn't even know
how to open the trunk.
- Chick?

802
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:31,672
- What chick?
- The driver.

803
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:34,372
Boy, she was a foxy little...

804
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,855
- Four women, and there was no money
in the car. I searched it.
- It's definitely possible.

805
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,087
- There's all kinds of paint...
- What are you two talking about?

806
01:01:41,196 --> 01:01:46,723
Of course. It's a red BMW
You might as well drive an ice cream truck.

807
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:50,100
The girls drove a BMW,
so that's what we look for. Then they change it.

808
01:01:50,205 --> 01:01:53,174
Wait a minute. You're saying that
all four robbers are women?

809
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,502
- Yeah.
- And you saw them?

810
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:57,624
Yeah.
Last night.

811
01:01:57,727 --> 01:02:01,629
Damn it! When exactly were you gonna share
this information with the FBI, Washburn?

812
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:04,632
- I tried to tell... I tried to tell you this morn...
- Shut up.

813
01:02:06,235 --> 01:02:08,635
Officer Preston,
come with me. Let's go.

814
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:11,502
You're fired. You're not suspended.

815
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:13,838
You're not on temporary leave.
You're fired.

816
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:17,538
Miss Williams, I'm giving this back to you
with a warning.

817
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:21,208
If I catch you driving that thing
in my city again, it is mine.

818
01:02:21,317 --> 01:02:23,945
Andy, as a friend,
I'm sorry.

819
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:25,850
- I tried this morning I went into...
- Shh. Andy.

820
01:02:25,955 --> 01:02:29,015
You've left me no choice.
Now, give me your badge.

821
01:02:40,403 --> 01:02:43,133
What...

822
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:50,746
Whew.

823
01:02:53,249 --> 01:02:56,184
Hey, wanna share a cab?

824
01:02:57,787 --> 01:03:00,381
- Yeah.
- Okay.

825
01:03:05,795 --> 01:03:07,695
Turn over.

826
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:09,765
What? What? What?

827
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:19,274
- All I ever wanted to do
was just be a cop, you know?

828
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:22,435
I wanted to be like my dad, you know?
My dad was a cop.

829
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:25,173
You know, I let him down.

830
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:28,216
I let you down. You're screwed.
You can't drive this anymore.

831
01:03:28,317 --> 01:03:31,753
She did not say that.
She said not to let the cops catch me.

832
01:03:34,323 --> 01:03:36,848
I can see why you like
that lieutenant. She feisty.

833
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,927
You like us feisty girls,
don't you?

834
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,928
So what's up?
You gonna give that another shot?

835
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:43,931
Give it another shot?
She fired me.

836
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:47,560
So? Redeem yourself.
Catch these thieves.

837
01:03:49,238 --> 01:03:51,763
Try and start this
for me, please.

838
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:00,909
Come on, baby. Come on.

839
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:04,475
Come on. That's... Yeah! Life!

840
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:09,388
Woo-hoo-hoo.
Wanna take it for a spin?

841
01:04:09,492 --> 01:04:13,326
- Oh, no-no-no. No, I'm... No, thanks.
- Come on. You need the practice.

842
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:16,557
No I drive fine, and I don't wanna...
I'm not in the mood for a driving lesson.

843
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,725
Who said anything
about a drivin' lesson?

844
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:22,794
It's just me in the passenger seat
and you drivin'

845
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:25,169
It's not a driving lesson?

846
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:31,408
Okay. All right. All right,
buckle up your safety belts, kids.

847
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:33,675
- All right.
- Here comes Washburn.

848
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:35,683
Just a...

849
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:38,982
Just a leisurely stroll through the evening.
And here we go.

850
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:41,613
Whoa, engine's started. My bad. Uh, okay.

851
01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:44,818
Turn... Light's here. Good. We have drive,
drive two... which is good, because.

852
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:48,021
- in case you need the second...
the sequel... to drive.
- Just chill out and drive, man.

853
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:50,599
Come on, now.
You just gotta relax just...

854
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,192
Come on. Let's relax just...

855
01:04:57,373 --> 01:04:59,967
Y- Yea-a-ah.

856
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:02,977
I said relax,
not hyperventilate.

857
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:04,979
Don't... What you...

858
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:08,448
Look how tight you grippin'
the steering wheel. Damn.

859
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:10,451
I'm tryin' to get
in my mode here, all right?

860
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:14,489
- I'm tryin' to get in the game.
- Why don't you let the game come to you?

861
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,957
Dag. See, that's your problem.
You try too hard.

862
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:22,087
You always overthink things.
You be kickin' down doors that's already open.

863
01:05:22,198 --> 01:05:26,760
You always tryin' to impress somebody:
Me, your dad, your ex.

864
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:31,499
Come on, now. If you ever gonna learn
how to drive, we gotta play to your strengths

865
01:05:31,607 --> 01:05:33,507
and thinkin' ain't one of 'em.

866
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:35,804
So, don't think.

867
01:05:35,912 --> 01:05:38,745
- Don't think. Don't think.
- Don't think. No.

868
01:05:38,848 --> 01:05:42,784
- Mm-mmm.
- Just clear your mind. Relax.

869
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:45,285
- Okay. Relax.
- Listen to some music.

870
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:50,155
Oh, yeah!

871
01:05:50,259 --> 01:05:53,558
- In the face!
- Oh, hell no. Hell, no.

872
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,563
- No, man.
- That was pretty good.

873
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:58,759
Hey, No, no! I like this one. Oh, yeah. Wait, wait.

874
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:00,768
- Natalie Cole, this one. Yeah.
- What you know about that?

875
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:03,634
That's one of my favorites I love this one.
This one, I used to...

876
01:06:03,739 --> 01:06:06,708
Just a little kid, man,
I used to sing it in my mirror in my bedroom.

877
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:09,073
- All right.
- I mean, I was, you know... you know...

878
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:12,238
- Hey. Whatever works for you.
- under supervision and everything like that.

879
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:14,942
- Go ahead and sing sing along to it.
- Oh, you don't want me singin'

880
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:18,543
Aw, come on sing sing the song!

881
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:32,961
Okay. All right. There you go. There you go!

882
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,367
- All right, now, put it in drive.
- Okay.

883
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:40,074
Who said stop singin'? Sing.

884
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:43,202
Sing the song. Sing the damn song.

885
01:06:43,312 --> 01:06:45,371
There we go.

886
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:47,381
Shoulders down.

887
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:50,145
Just relax. Yeah. There you go.

888
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:59,752
You got it! You got it, man!

889
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,775
- Whoo!
- Hold on to the wheel. There you go.

890
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,041
Thank you so much.

891
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:22,049
Oh, dude, you're drivin;

892
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,616
Um, wait. Jesse, baby, please.
Just stop buggin' for two minutes.

893
01:07:30,726 --> 01:07:33,661
- Let me just explain what's...
- Shh, shh you okay, B? I been worried sick.

894
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:37,290
- Yeah.
- Come on, girl.

895
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,597
Um, baby, what are you doin' here?

896
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:46,039
You left your phone here. He called,
and I explained everything to him. And...

897
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:48,940
Belle, he's a dream.

898
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:52,037
- So, you're not mad at me no more?
- How could I be mad at you?

899
01:07:52,148 --> 01:07:54,048
- You was mad at me.
- I wasn't that mad.

900
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:57,483
- Come here.
- Ohhh.
- I... mmm.

901
01:07:57,586 --> 01:07:59,611
- Well, I missed you. Mmm.
- I missed you too, baby.

902
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:02,987
- Oh.
- Oh, my.

903
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:07,695
- This is like watching pay-per-view.
- Mother!

904
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:10,561
Ooh.

905
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,896
Mom, clear your throat.

906
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,368
- Uh, hi.
- Hi.

907
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,464
- Come on. Let's go home.
- Oh, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere.

908
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:21,543
- I made dinner.
- No, you didn't.

909
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:25,478
No, I didn't. But, I made margaritas.

910
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:28,510
We can order.
Oh, boy, can we order.

911
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:32,519
All right, look, let's be logical about this.
Let's go through the story one more time.

912
01:08:32,621 --> 01:08:34,816
- Yeah.
- Okeydoke.
B.M. W. Pulls out in front, right?

913
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:38,416
Well, see, that's the amazing thing right there...
getting a parking space in Manhattan.

914
01:08:39,562 --> 01:08:41,427
Yeah. Jesse's totally right.
Wait a sec.

915
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:46,263
How do you get a parkin' space in front
of a bank two days in a row? In Manhattan?

916
01:08:46,369 --> 01:08:49,361
Yeah, 'cause the only places I ever find
are no-parkin' zones:

917
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:52,839
Loadin' zones, hospitals
or streets that are "no parking" for, uh...

918
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,247
- Garbage day.
- Yeah.

919
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:05,184
- The whole side of the street is a no-parkin' zone.
- Course!

920
01:09:05,287 --> 01:09:09,451
So, they rob the bank early in the morning,
then they put the cash in the garbage can.

921
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:12,459
We chase the Beemer. The garbage truck

922
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:15,086
picks up the cash,
and they meet up later on.

923
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:17,893
So even if you do catch 'em,
that's why they ain't got the money on 'em.

924
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,696
The only thing they need to pull it off
is a garbage man.

925
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:23,271
- We gotta find that garbage man.
- Okay.

926
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:25,306
- Bye, Mom.
- Hold on. Where you goin'?

927
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:27,467
Bye, baby.

928
01:09:27,576 --> 01:09:30,374
Wait, wait! Yo, whoa!
Yo, what do you want me to do with this?

929
01:09:32,415 --> 01:09:36,283
We can't wait till the morning.
The FBI may have already caught them by then.

930
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:39,445
I mean... You know what I mean.
Just keep a lookout.

931
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,058
Hurry up.

932
01:09:47,296 --> 01:09:49,787
Voilà!

933
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:53,926
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't think they have an alarm?

934
01:09:54,036 --> 01:09:56,937
Come on. It's not Fort Knox.
It's the Department of Sanitation.

935
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,202
Ooh. Shh! Quiet down.

936
01:10:00,309 --> 01:10:02,743
Plan "B" Plan "B"
Plan "B"

937
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:09,309
Police. We heard the alarm.

938
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:11,613
- What's... What's goin' on here? Everything cool?
- You all right?

939
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,247
- Officer, uh, uh, Mullins. This is Officer...
- Good snatch.

940
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:20,158
Hello, what do we have here? Uh-oh,
obvious "B and E" Perps might be still inside.

941
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:22,992
- Way to stay cool, dude. Way to stay cool.
- Yeah. Look!

942
01:10:23,099 --> 01:10:25,590
They even left
their lock picks.

943
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:28,932
Surely they got
prints on these.

944
01:10:29,038 --> 01:10:32,599
- Gotta... Gotta tag these. What's your name, sir?
- Verne.

945
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,608
- Earn?
- Verne!

946
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:37,008
- Yeah. Bern, where's the nearest...
- Verne!

947
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:38,705
- Verne?
- Verne.

948
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:40,372
Verne. Where's the nearest
computer, Verne?

949
01:10:41,595 --> 01:10:44,063
The computers are inside.
Follow me.

950
01:10:44,164 --> 01:10:46,428
All right. We find out who works 36th Street...

951
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:48,660
From Third to Broadway on Wednesday...

952
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:52,102
Leonard and Church on Thursday,
bang, we got our garbage man.

953
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,006
Okay. "personnel, '"
"Routes';! Here we go.

954
01:10:55,109 --> 01:10:58,510
"Routes" All right
"36th," "Wednesday,"

955
01:10:58,612 --> 01:11:02,070
- Boom, there we go. We got our man.
- "Anthony Scalia"

956
01:11:02,182 --> 01:11:05,115
Yep. Same garbage man got both routes.
You see that?

957
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,813
"Three East 117th Street, Apartment 4R. '"
Yeah. Boom. Let's go.

958
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,824
I'm getting used
to your driving.

959
01:11:25,275 --> 01:11:26,970
Okay. Here's the plan.

960
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:29,977
- I'm gonna need you to boost me up
to that fire escape...
- Cable!

961
01:11:37,454 --> 01:11:39,922
Mr Scalia,
it's the police. Open up!

962
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,333
Thanks.
Stay back.

963
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:02,877
Damn.

964
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:03,673
Hello?

965
01:12:09,786 --> 01:12:12,220
Shh.

966
01:12:12,322 --> 01:12:15,450
One last pickup,
then you are free.

967
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:18,823
You bring us
the cash again

968
01:12:18,928 --> 01:12:21,192
then, hey...
we let you go.

969
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:24,164
We... We let your wife go.

970
01:12:24,267 --> 01:12:27,100
After I bring you the money,
how do I know what will happen then?

971
01:12:27,203 --> 01:12:30,104
You don't.

972
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:34,404
But if you go to the police,
you do know what will happen.

973
01:12:34,511 --> 01:12:36,411
Huh?

974
01:12:47,257 --> 01:12:49,487
- So, that's the best way, over here.
- Mm-hmm.

975
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:52,060
We get in from here, and, uh.

976
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:55,494
I think the best way out is coming from here
so we can make it faster.

977
01:13:02,005 --> 01:13:05,065
Your car, sir.

978
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:07,369
Okay, girls.
Time to go.

979
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:16,046
Don't transfer me again I need the route
of Anthony Scalia, okay? It's an emergency. Now!

980
01:13:16,152 --> 01:13:20,851
Look. It was on the fridge. He works
midtown today, then he's off for two weeks.

981
01:13:20,957 --> 01:13:23,619
- Oh, my God. It's gotta be today.
- Yep.

982
01:13:23,726 --> 01:13:27,719
Get me Lieutenant Robbins.
This is Washburn Marta... Lieutenant, look...

983
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:30,924
Whatever you're gonna say,
I don't wanna get into this right now. I'm busy.

984
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:35,095
- I got FBI all over my ass.
- L-Lieutenant, with all due respect...

985
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:38,469
- I just can't hear you right...
- Shut up, Marta!

986
01:13:38,575 --> 01:13:41,476
Now, look, they're usin' garbage trucks
to get the money out, okay?

987
01:13:41,578 --> 01:13:43,478
Both robberies were on
the same garbage man's route.

988
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:47,243
We went to his house.
There's gonna be another robbery this morning.

989
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:50,444
I know I'm a hundred percent sure.
Please trust me, will you?

990
01:13:52,155 --> 01:13:54,055
- What bank?
- It's gonna happen

991
01:13:54,157 --> 01:13:57,058
somewhere between 23rd and 34th,
east of Fifth.

992
01:14:05,068 --> 01:14:08,834
Down! Down!
Everybody down!

993
01:14:08,938 --> 01:14:11,236
If I see anybody's eyes,
I shoot.

994
01:14:12,842 --> 01:14:15,276
You! On the ground. Go.

995
01:14:18,715 --> 01:14:20,615
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.
Pull over. Stop, stop.

996
01:14:21,918 --> 01:14:24,682
Pull over.

997
01:14:40,436 --> 01:14:43,337
One squad car?

998
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,068
She didn't believe me.

999
01:14:49,178 --> 01:14:52,579
So?
So, what we gonna do?

1000
01:15:04,627 --> 01:15:06,527
Fall back. Halt!

1001
01:15:09,065 --> 01:15:12,831
- Hey, grab somebody.
- Drop your weapons and step out of the car!

1002
01:15:25,615 --> 01:15:27,515
On the ground! Now!

1003
01:15:27,617 --> 01:15:32,179
In this skirt?
I don't think so.

1004
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:48,561
Now, I'm going to drive away.
And if I see any cops, the kid dies.

1005
01:15:48,671 --> 01:15:51,902
- Okay, girls. Let's go.
- Wait wait, wait, wait.

1006
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:55,067
Okay?

1007
01:15:56,179 --> 01:15:58,613
Can't let you take him.

1008
01:15:58,715 --> 01:16:00,580
- Look, take me. Okay?
- Robbins.

1009
01:16:02,452 --> 01:16:05,114
- Marta.
- It's okay.

1010
01:16:11,127 --> 01:16:14,858
Okay. Come here.

1011
01:16:14,964 --> 01:16:16,761
Get over here!

1012
01:16:16,866 --> 01:16:20,029
Spread 'em.
Let's make sure you're not wearing a wire.

1013
01:16:32,048 --> 01:16:34,278
Turn around.

1014
01:16:34,383 --> 01:16:36,544
Damn.

1015
01:16:51,734 --> 01:16:55,465
Oh, Jesus.
Would you take me too?

1016
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,970
Okay.
Get in the car.

1017
01:17:00,076 --> 01:17:02,636
- Come on. Come on.
- Thanks.

1018
01:17:04,514 --> 01:17:07,244
Any cops follow me,
she dies.

1019
01:17:09,051 --> 01:17:11,019
Belle, we gotta
do somethin'

1020
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:18,791
All units, all units.
Be on the lookout for a blue B.M.W...

1021
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:20,419
headed north on Park Avenue.

1022
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:23,260
This is Air Unit 1070. We lost 'em.

1023
01:17:23,366 --> 01:17:25,960
We have no visual
of the suspects.

1024
01:17:26,068 --> 01:17:30,869
Suspects last seen in the vicinity of 42nd
and Vanderbilt near Grand Central Station.

1025
01:17:43,786 --> 01:17:46,414
Washburn,
you stay out of this.

1026
01:17:46,522 --> 01:17:51,221
- All right? Whatever you got planned, don't do it.
- I don't got a plan.

1027
01:17:51,327 --> 01:17:54,455
- All units, all units.
Suspects still at large.

1028
01:17:54,564 --> 01:17:57,397
Last seen headed north on Third Avenue.

1029
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,297
Callin' my own backup.

1030
01:18:02,505 --> 01:18:04,735
- Be on the lookout for a blue B.M.W.
- Hey.

1031
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:06,832
Suspects are armed
and dangerous.

1032
01:18:06,943 --> 01:18:09,309
- Mario?
- Yo, Belle. What's goin' on?

1033
01:18:09,412 --> 01:18:12,210
Listen, listen, listen.
I need your help.

1034
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:14,349
Mr Scalia,
I'm a police officer.

1035
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:18,147
Come on, fellas who's got 'em? Who's got 'em?

1036
01:18:18,254 --> 01:18:20,154
We're still lookin'
We haven't seen anything yet.

1037
01:18:34,303 --> 01:18:37,033
I got 'em Fifty-seventh and Third, northbound.

1038
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:40,597
- Damn! They're probably at...
- Sixty-fifth Street, heading north.

1039
01:18:42,345 --> 01:18:46,076
Damn! We don't have anybody up there.
We're gonna lose 'em.

1040
01:18:46,182 --> 01:18:48,275
I'm on my way.

1041
01:18:58,861 --> 01:19:00,954
- Hey. How you doin'? I got your money.
- Against the wall.

1042
01:19:01,063 --> 01:19:03,122
Oh, shit. You got a gun.

1043
01:19:08,371 --> 01:19:11,636
If they get past 125th,
we're gonna lose 'em.

1044
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:24,142
Come here!

1045
01:19:24,253 --> 01:19:27,780
- Ha, ha you got punk'd.
- Sit down!

1046
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,552
- You okay, Ms Scalia? It's okay. It's okay.
- Oh, help me.

1047
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,287
It's okay. It's okay.

1048
01:19:32,395 --> 01:19:34,295
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1049
01:19:34,397 --> 01:19:36,388
- Come on. Get out of here.
- Thank you.

1050
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:38,399
Oh! Thank God.

1051
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:40,594
- Oh, my baby.
- Thank you.

1052
01:19:49,178 --> 01:19:51,612
Wow. That's a cool car.

1053
01:19:51,714 --> 01:19:54,239
You can have it.
Have fun.

1054
01:19:56,118 --> 01:19:57,813
They can chase him for a little while now.

1055
01:19:58,921 --> 01:20:01,321
Shit.
Oh, cool.

1056
01:20:01,424 --> 01:20:03,153
- Now, where's Marta?
- Who's Marta?

1057
01:20:03,259 --> 01:20:06,490
- Come on! Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
They never tell me anything I swear.

1058
01:20:06,595 --> 01:20:10,656
Oh, shit. Oh, my God Look at all this money.

1059
01:20:10,766 --> 01:20:14,031
Look, I'm just gonna take a couple thou'
for the damage to my cab

1060
01:20:14,136 --> 01:20:16,570
'cause ain't nobody payin' for that
quick enough.

1061
01:20:16,672 --> 01:20:20,039
Oh, my God. Shit.

1062
01:20:22,945 --> 01:20:24,845
- Hello?
- All right. Check it out.

1063
01:20:24,947 --> 01:20:30,283
They stopped at Marcus Garvey Avenue and 122nd.
Switchin' into two silver Beemers, M3's.

1064
01:20:30,386 --> 01:20:32,616
Put her on the phone.

1065
01:20:32,722 --> 01:20:34,383
Excuse me, ma.

1066
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:36,458
- What?
- You got a phone call.

1067
01:20:38,894 --> 01:20:42,728
- Hello?
- Chasin' you around the city has been so much fun.

1068
01:20:42,832 --> 01:20:45,130
- And this tip, girl...
- W-What are you talkin' about?

1069
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:49,500
- I'm talkin' 'bout your money.
- We got it! We got your money.
All of it! Hey, tell her.

1070
01:20:49,605 --> 01:20:53,336
- Tell her.
And that cop chasing you is not a real cop.

1071
01:20:53,442 --> 01:20:55,842
- Turns out... Ow! Ow!
- Shut up. Be quiet.

1072
01:20:55,945 --> 01:20:58,140
He is a real cop.
He just got fired.

1073
01:20:58,247 --> 01:21:00,340
What do you want, cabbie?

1074
01:21:00,449 --> 01:21:02,713
I'll tell you what I want.
What do I want?

1075
01:21:02,818 --> 01:21:05,412
- A trade A trade.
- I want a trade.

1076
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:09,048
- The money for the girl.
Always wanted to say shit like that.
- Come on. Come on.

1077
01:21:10,426 --> 01:21:12,326
- Deal.
- Yeah, all right.

1078
01:21:12,428 --> 01:21:16,762
We make the exchange
on 125th Street and 12th Avenue.

1079
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:20,358
- Three minutes. No tricks.
- Yeah. Three minutes. Whatever.

1080
01:21:20,469 --> 01:21:23,063
All right, let's get the rest of the money in a bag.

1081
01:21:23,172 --> 01:21:25,902
Yo, yo, my phone!

1082
01:21:29,345 --> 01:21:32,837
You heard her, Mullins. You got three minutes.
Now, haul ass and stay out of sight.

1083
01:21:32,948 --> 01:21:37,544
Don't worry. We'll have the roadblock all set up.
Don't wait for us.

1084
01:21:45,361 --> 01:21:47,727
Either backup is lyin' really low,
or they just not here yet.

1085
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,764
What if she doesn't
take the bait?

1086
01:21:53,235 --> 01:21:55,863
Change of plans.

1087
01:21:55,971 --> 01:21:58,371
- I thought we had a deal.
- Never said I was stopping.

1088
01:21:58,474 --> 01:22:02,240
Follow me. We'll make the exchange on the go...
that's if you can keep up with that heap.

1089
01:22:18,661 --> 01:22:20,993
Washburn. Turn the car around.
Turn the car around!

1090
01:22:23,099 --> 01:22:27,058
"Don't wait for me" He must have thought
he sounded so cool sayin' that.

1091
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:30,935
- Come on. What are we doin'? We need a plan.
- I'm workin' on it!

1092
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:08,137
No more chitchat.
Give me the cash now, or I shoot the girl.

1093
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:10,007
All right, all right.
Just calm down.

1094
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:17,677
I got a plan.
But we need to stall.

1095
01:23:17,786 --> 01:23:21,017
- What?
- Start the transfer but don't complete it.

1096
01:23:24,627 --> 01:23:27,960
- Trust me.
- All right.

1097
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:42,400
Too early! Not yet! Trust me.

1098
01:23:45,347 --> 01:23:48,805
Hey, these two big trucks comin' up...
is this part of your plan too?

1099
01:23:50,252 --> 01:23:52,743
- Get me in! Get me in!
- Come on!

1100
01:23:56,992 --> 01:23:57,754
Whoa!

1101
01:24:02,464 --> 01:24:05,524
- Gonna hit a truck!
- Too early! Get out. Get out of here!

1102
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,604
- Get me in! Get me in!
- No, we gotta stall!

1103
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:18,373
- What are you talking about?
- Hey! You got a car. You got a car coming!

1104
01:24:30,993 --> 01:24:35,794
- The exit's comin' up. We need to have 'em take it.
- This way. Less traffic.

1105
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,940
Give me the cash.
No more games.

1106
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:50,205
- Girl first.
- No. Girl first.

1107
01:24:50,312 --> 01:24:52,576
- No! We'll switch same time.
- On "three"

1108
01:24:52,681 --> 01:24:54,774
- One...
- One...

1109
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,653
- Two...
- Two...

1110
01:25:00,322 --> 01:25:01,914
- Three!
- Ah!

1111
01:25:05,928 --> 01:25:08,897
Brake!

1112
01:25:36,025 --> 01:25:40,428
Oi!

1113
01:25:43,599 --> 01:25:45,260
Yeah!

1114
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:53,207
Die!

1115
01:25:55,144 --> 01:25:56,543
Oh, shoot.

1116
01:26:00,883 --> 01:26:03,408
Jesus.
You're hit.

1117
01:26:03,519 --> 01:26:06,852
- That skank shot me.
- We gotta get you to a hospital.

1118
01:26:06,955 --> 01:26:10,686
- Come on.
- Stay low.

1119
01:26:10,793 --> 01:26:14,229
- Watch out.
- Watch your head. Okay.

1120
01:26:16,265 --> 01:26:20,133
What are you doing? You... I should drive Andy...

1121
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:22,135
- Come on.
- I got it Belle, hang in there.

1122
01:26:22,237 --> 01:26:23,727
- He's got it.
- No, he don't got it.

1123
01:26:23,839 --> 01:26:26,171
- You got it, don't you?
- Yeah.

1124
01:26:27,276 --> 01:26:29,335
I'm lettin' the game
come to me.

1125
01:26:40,289 --> 01:26:42,382
- Why are you singing? Why...
- Don't stop singing.

1126
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:45,016
- You don't... Why is he singing?
- He sings. Don't stop him.

1127
01:26:45,127 --> 01:26:47,220
He sings?

1128
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:24,056
Oh, yeah. Get me St Mary's emergency room.

1129
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:27,158
- Whoo!
- Washburn, there's the exit!

1130
01:27:29,671 --> 01:27:32,572
The rooms are prepped for surgery.
Pull up to the ER entrance

1131
01:27:32,674 --> 01:27:36,269
and park in the white zone, but not...

1132
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:48,318
Okay, let's get this woman to surgery!

1133
01:27:48,424 --> 01:27:53,555
Come on. Move it! And when
you get her there, prep her. Quickly!

1134
01:27:53,662 --> 01:27:57,996
Come on. Get this steppin; people.
There ain't nothin' for you to see here. Move it!

1135
01:27:59,802 --> 01:28:01,929
Welcome, NASCAR race fans.

1136
01:28:02,037 --> 01:28:04,096
We got a lot going on
this weekend.

1137
01:28:04,206 --> 01:28:07,403
Several NASCAR racing divisions
are represented here today.

1138
01:28:07,509 --> 01:28:10,069
And rookie driver.
Belle Williams...

1139
01:28:10,179 --> 01:28:12,579
with her new sponsor,
the banks of New York...

1140
01:28:12,681 --> 01:28:14,808
is taking to the track
for the first time ever...

1141
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:17,078
to run practice
for her racing division.

1142
01:28:26,094 --> 01:28:29,086
The whole crew stands to make money
on this one 'cause we all bet on you.

1143
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:32,099
You know where your money's good at.
All right, check the tires.

1144
01:28:32,201 --> 01:28:34,101
- Hey!
- Yo, you got visitors.

1145
01:28:34,203 --> 01:28:38,105
- Hey!
- Oh, my gosh. You look great. That's so cool.

1146
01:28:38,207 --> 01:28:40,732
- You look so cool! How are you?
- Hey!

1147
01:28:40,843 --> 01:28:42,743
- Wow. You look great.
- Hi.

1148
01:28:42,845 --> 01:28:44,745
- Oh, man.
- Wow I love it.

1149
01:28:44,847 --> 01:28:47,475
- How are you, Belle?
- Well, what do you think, huh?

1150
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:50,143
- It's our latest undercover assignment:
Russian mafia.
- What?

1151
01:28:50,252 --> 01:28:52,720
Ah! Okay.
I'll buy it I'll buy it.

1152
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:56,086
- So, how are your new sponsors treating you, huh?
- Oh, good. Check it out.

1153
01:28:56,191 --> 01:28:59,718
- They have hooked me up.
- This is unbelievable. It looks great.

1154
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:03,893
I remember saving this one.
I remember saving this one.

1155
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:06,297
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey, what's up, man?

1156
01:29:06,401 --> 01:29:11,668
All right. Don't tell me. What do you got here?
Probably a 358 CI, four-barrel carb.

1157
01:29:11,773 --> 01:29:15,641
720 horsepower,
8500 R.P.M.?

1158
01:29:15,744 --> 01:29:19,510
- I'm impressed.
- Oh, he's got it written on his hand.

1159
01:29:19,615 --> 01:29:21,742
- Mom!
- Come on.

1160
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,977
She's wasted.

1161
01:29:24,086 --> 01:29:26,748
- He's stupid.
- Oh, Jesse.

1162
01:29:26,855 --> 01:29:29,483
Come on. Let's have
a cold one, okay?

1163
01:29:29,591 --> 01:29:32,719
- I'll be with you in a minute, all right?
- She really needs a cold one.

1164
01:29:32,828 --> 01:29:35,023
- Hey, watch your ass out there, baby.
- I will.

1165
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:37,860
- 'Cause it's mine, all right?
- I will. Mm-hmm.

1166
01:29:39,968 --> 01:29:42,493
- Anyway... Oh, dude, we gotta split. Party time.
- Yeah.

1167
01:29:42,604 --> 01:29:45,164
- Good luck.
- Let's go. Bye.

1168
01:29:45,274 --> 01:29:48,141
- What are you d...
- I thought... Sorry.
I thought there was a moment there.

1169
01:29:48,243 --> 01:29:51,371
I'm s... Did you not... Are...
You keep giving me signals.

1170
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,040
No signals.
There's no moment.

1171
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:56,049
There will be others.

1172
01:29:56,151 --> 01:29:58,210
There will be others.

1173
01:29:59,855 --> 01:30:02,415
Hey, take care
of yourself, 5-0

1174
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:04,856
And don't do nothin'
crazy or stupid, all right?

1175
01:30:05,961 --> 01:30:08,862
Crazy and stupid's
my style.

1176
01:30:10,632 --> 01:30:12,759
- Watch where you're goin'
- That yours?

1177
01:30:14,803 --> 01:30:17,135
- Oh, my God.
- That's your boy.

1178
01:30:17,239 --> 01:30:19,707
- That's your boy. You ready to do this or what?
- All right. Yeah.

1179
01:30:21,443 --> 01:30:23,809
All the cars are heading out to the track.

1180
01:30:23,912 --> 01:30:26,813
- Practice is now underway.
- Hey, come on, boys.

1181
01:30:26,915 --> 01:30:29,713
And we have a special
announcement on the Jumbotron...

1182
01:30:29,818 --> 01:30:33,481
for banks of New York driver.
Belle Williams from Jesse.

1183
01:30:37,593 --> 01:30:41,222
Ha, ha! Oh, my God!

1184
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:44,458
Yes, yes, yes!
Of course I will.

1185
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:51,601
- And we see NASCAR's
premier series driver, Jeff Gordon...

1186
01:30:51,707 --> 01:30:54,005
- returning to drive lead with the setup.
- Come on, boys!

1187
01:30:54,109 --> 01:30:56,942
- Congratulations, Belle.
- Thanks, Jeff.

1188
01:30:57,045 --> 01:30:59,104
You ready?

1189
01:30:59,214 --> 01:31:02,445
- Ready to try and smoke you.
- All right. Well, let's do this thing.

1190
01:31:02,551 --> 01:31:05,645
All right. Let's do it

1191
01:31:20,435 --> 01:31:24,337
''up, bro? How you doin'? Yeah.

1192
01:31:26,742 --> 01:31:28,801
Yeah?

1193
01:31:39,021 --> 01:31:40,921
Against
the car.

1194
01:31:41,023 --> 01:31:44,117
- Cut!
- I'm sorry I pinch her butt.

1195
01:31:44,226 --> 01:31:45,488
Mark!

1196
01:31:45,594 --> 01:31:47,152
- Whoa!
- All right.

1197
01:31:47,262 --> 01:31:49,389
Here we go.
Here comes Junior.

1198
01:31:49,498 --> 01:31:51,398
Oh.
Geez.

1199
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,958
What the...
Wait! Oh, Lord.

1200
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:56,970
What...

1201
01:31:57,072 --> 01:32:00,906
And... cut!

1202
01:32:01,009 --> 01:32:05,241
- Yeah, where in the car?
- Door panel on the left just pull it.

1203
01:32:05,347 --> 01:32:07,338
Say it.
Don't spray it.

1204
01:32:07,449 --> 01:32:10,646
- Think they're after computers?
- No, I think they're after your balls.

1205
01:32:10,752 --> 01:32:12,652
Yeah. They're after
the computers.

1206
01:32:14,923 --> 01:32:16,823
Next time you guys are in Havana,
you give me a call

1207
01:32:16,925 --> 01:32:21,021
and come over and play Playstation, you know,
and play, uh... you know, hang out.

1208
01:32:21,129 --> 01:32:23,689
You know, eat a gordita, you know,
which is a taco inside another taco...

1209
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:26,859
soft inside of a hard one...
more beef, and then beans, and then more beef...

1210
01:32:26,968 --> 01:32:30,199
another taco,
and then into another one...

1211
01:32:30,305 --> 01:32:33,331
You must be starving,
little baby.

1212
01:32:33,442 --> 01:32:35,342
Oh!

1213
01:32:35,444 --> 01:32:40,245
- Door panel on the left.
- You make me mad, dude.

1214
01:32:40,348 --> 01:32:42,339
- You heard me?
- Door panel on the left.

1215
01:32:42,451 --> 01:32:44,351
- Yeah.
- Just pull it.

1216
01:32:44,453 --> 01:32:46,921
- All right? I'm tellin' you you could...
- Baby.

1217
01:32:47,022 --> 01:32:48,922
Be there.

1218
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:52,123
- I don't know why I'm puttin' the phone here.
- Yeah.

1219
01:32:52,227 --> 01:32:54,957
- Maybe your shoulder has something to say.
- Okay. Yeah I don't know.

1220
01:32:55,063 --> 01:32:59,193
- Just pull it.
- Man.

1221
01:32:59,301 --> 01:33:01,292
- Just grab it.
- I know. No. Shh "Grab it" is better.

1222
01:33:01,403 --> 01:33:04,236
I can't believe this day.

1223
01:33:04,339 --> 01:33:06,773
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Yo.

1224
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:11,812
I sound like Barry White's
illegitimate white grandson.

1225
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:38,404
Hey, wait, wait.
I have an appointment.

1226
01:37:38,513 --> 01:37:43,041
I'm sorry I can't hear you because
of the sign that says we're "closed"

1227
01:37:43,151 --> 01:37:45,551
Aw, come on, man.
Give a sister a break.

1228
01:37:45,653 --> 01:37:47,951
I been workin' for this for five years.

1229
01:37:48,056 --> 01:37:51,753
Fillin' out these forms and taking these tests.
Waitin' in these lines.

1230
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:55,556
I'd love to help you, but I'm sorry.

1231
01:38:02,604 --> 01:38:04,572
You know

1232
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:09,632
a handsome man like you
should not have trouble getting a cab.

1233
01:38:09,744 --> 01:38:12,008
Mmm!

1234
01:38:12,113 --> 01:38:14,274
What is that scent you're wearing?

1235
01:38:14,382 --> 01:38:18,580
Could that be English Leather?

1236
01:38:18,686 --> 01:38:22,122
It is, huh?
Ooh, it's thick too. Ooh!

1237
01:38:22,223 --> 01:38:26,751
I bet you be having the ladies
in this office going crazy, huh?

1238
01:38:26,861 --> 01:38:28,988
I'll tell you something

1239
01:38:29,097 --> 01:38:31,964
and I know you gotta go
so I'm not gonna keep you too long

1240
01:38:32,066 --> 01:38:35,934
but I would pick you up anytime

1241
01:38:36,037 --> 01:38:39,234
every time and at all times

1242
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,774
if I had my hack license.

1243
01:38:54,889 --> 01:38:57,551
Man.

1244
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:00,184
Aw, he bought candles.

1245
01:39:12,507 --> 01:39:14,941
Tomorrow night's lows in the 50s.

1246
01:39:15,043 --> 01:39:17,807
Cool and breezy till Wednesday,
with a chance of rain...

1247
01:39:25,586 --> 01:39:29,022
Hmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1248
01:39:36,264 --> 01:39:38,164
Baby.

1249
01:39:38,266 --> 01:39:40,200
Baby.

1250
01:39:40,301 --> 01:39:43,327
Babe!

1251
01:39:55,349 --> 01:39:57,613
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1252
01:40:47,135 --> 01:40:49,035
Mmm.

1253
01:40:54,275 --> 01:40:56,243
Now, where are you going?

1254
01:40:56,344 --> 01:40:58,744
Work.

1255
01:40:58,846 --> 01:41:01,713
It's only... 5:30?

1256
01:41:01,816 --> 01:41:06,583
Yeah, well, I had to get some extra shifts
so I could get last night off.

1257
01:41:06,687 --> 01:41:09,815
I'm sorry, baby, but that line
at the TLC was ridiculous.

1258
01:41:09,924 --> 01:41:14,224
Yeah. You know, it's always something, B
It's always something.

1259
01:41:14,328 --> 01:41:18,526
But I bet you had time to put on that damn,
uh, supercharger thing, didn't you?

1260
01:41:18,633 --> 01:41:22,069
Come on, baby I'm really sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

1261
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:24,468
I'll make it up to you
soon as you get off.

1262
01:41:24,572 --> 01:41:26,540
- How?
- You tell me.

1263
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:32,807
Mmm, okay. All right, baby.

1264
01:41:32,914 --> 01:41:36,247
You better be ready when I get back, girl.
All right? I'm...

1265
01:41:37,819 --> 01:41:40,947
Don't hurt yourself now.

1266
01:41:41,055 --> 01:41:44,115
I don't want no excuses later.

1267
01:42:01,687 --> 01:42:05,521
Tsk. Stop playing.
You live next door to your moms?

1268
01:42:05,624 --> 01:42:08,320
Makes her feel safe.

1269
01:42:08,427 --> 01:42:13,387
She must not've
seen you in action, huh?

1270
01:42:18,037 --> 01:42:20,028
Uhh...

1271
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,538
Uh, it's a little messy, but, you know.

1272
01:42:23,642 --> 01:42:26,611
I've been working late so I haven't
had time to fix up the place.

1273
01:42:26,712 --> 01:42:29,681
I got some good artwork
on the way on eBay.

1274
01:42:29,782 --> 01:42:32,182
It's on the...
You know, I'm still bidding.

1275
01:42:32,284 --> 01:42:36,880
So make yourself at home, okay?
Enjoy yourself.

1276
01:42:36,989 --> 01:42:40,083
Okay. Ooh.

1277
01:42:40,192 --> 01:42:43,161
Nice. My hair.

1278
01:42:44,864 --> 01:42:46,764
Hey.

1279
01:42:49,468 --> 01:42:52,062
Okay, you're in luck.
I have two options.

1280
01:42:52,171 --> 01:42:55,504
You got the sleeping bag times
or the love capsule.

1281
01:43:00,312 --> 01:43:02,746
The love capsule.

1282
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:07,078
"Dan"? Who is Dan?

1283
01:43:07,186 --> 01:43:10,212
It's supposed to say "danger"

1284
01:43:10,356 --> 01:43:12,586
You know how it is.

1285
01:43:12,691 --> 01:43:14,784
Nah, I don't know how it is.

1286
01:43:16,562 --> 01:43:18,462
Tattoos hurt.

1287
01:43:18,564 --> 01:43:21,328
You know, they stick needles in.

1288
01:43:21,433 --> 01:43:24,869
You know how tattoos happen?
They put needles in.

1289
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:28,906
I think you better get that tattoo finished

1290
01:43:29,008 --> 01:43:31,306
as a warning to the rest of us.

1291
01:43:35,247 --> 01:43:39,274
Oh, God, it feels good to lay down.

1292
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:48,252
Good night.

1293
01:43:49,762 --> 01:43:54,222
What kind of grown-ass man
lives 10 feet away from his mama?

1294
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:57,302
I wouldn't talk so much.

1295
01:43:57,403 --> 01:44:00,372
Isabelle "Precious" Williams.

1296
01:44:00,472 --> 01:44:03,930
- Who told you about my name?
- It's in your record.

1297
01:44:04,043 --> 01:44:06,568
Precious.
My Precious.

1298
01:44:06,679 --> 01:44:10,877
Go ahead. Say it again.
Say it again, see what happens I dare you.

1299
01:44:21,226 --> 01:44:23,694
Precious.

1300
01:44:48,988 --> 01:44:51,286
What the hell?
Get your ass off of me!

1301
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:53,187
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- What you doin' down here?

1302
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:57,194
- What's wrong with you?
- I should have warned you I'm sorry.

1303
01:44:57,296 --> 01:44:59,560
I roll when I sleep sometimes.
I move.

1304
01:44:59,665 --> 01:45:02,463
- I'm a restless sleeper.
- Yeah, you restless, all right.

1305
01:45:02,568 --> 01:45:06,629
I didn't know what was happening there,
but we... we spooned, okay?

1306
01:45:06,739 --> 01:45:10,300
We spooned a little bit.
At least we didn't fork.

1307
01:45:10,409 --> 01:45:13,640
We didn't... please, be nice.

1308
01:45:13,746 --> 01:45:16,010
Wait wait.

1309
01:45:16,115 --> 01:45:19,812
I just remembered something the girls
kept saying over and over to each other

1310
01:45:19,985 --> 01:45:21,919
"Nice 'dua rateeraros."

1311
01:45:24,757 --> 01:45:26,782
Mais duas retiradas?

1312
01:45:26,892 --> 01:45:28,792
Yeah. That's what they said.

1313
01:45:28,894 --> 01:45:30,862
That means,
"Two more withdrawals"

1314
01:45:30,996 --> 01:45:33,430
Two more withdrawals?
Let's go! Let's go!

1315
01:45:33,532 --> 01:45:36,057
You might want to change
your clothes, freak.

1316
01:45:36,168 --> 01:45:39,228
I want five cars on 14th and Broadway
waitin', and I want 'em now.

1317
01:45:41,848 --> 01:45:44,248
- Did she have an accent?
- Jersey.

1318
01:45:44,351 --> 01:45:46,911
Mmm.

1319
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:49,955
- What size was her bust?
- What?

1320
01:45:50,056 --> 01:45:51,921
Her bosom.

1321
01:45:52,025 --> 01:45:54,585
Her hooters. Her headlights.
Her flesh pillows. Her fun bags.

1322
01:45:54,694 --> 01:45:56,924
Her knockers. Her rack. Her boobs.

1323
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:59,999
Oh.
They were about like, uh...

1324
01:46:01,334 --> 01:46:03,165
Compared to mine. What?

1325
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:05,738
Yeah. About like that, yeah.

1326
01:46:05,839 --> 01:46:08,000
34-C

1327
01:46:09,276 --> 01:46:12,939
All right, finish up, Officer.

1328
01:46:13,079 --> 01:46:16,310
- Four women, and there was no
money in the car. I searched it.
- It's definitely possible.

1329
01:46:16,416 --> 01:46:18,509
- There's all kinds of paint...
- What are you two talking about?

1330
01:46:18,618 --> 01:46:24,420
Of course. It's a red BMW. You might
as well drive a ice cream truck.

1331
01:46:24,524 --> 01:46:27,084
The girls drove a BMW, so that's what
we look for. Then they change it.

1332
01:46:27,193 --> 01:46:30,629
Wait a minute. You're saying
that all four robbers are women?

1333
01:46:30,730 --> 01:46:31,924
- Yeah.
- And you saw them?

1334
01:46:33,665 --> 01:46:35,929
Do you think they're after computers?

1335
01:46:36,034 --> 01:46:38,901
Verne!
You actu... Verne, crackheads!

1336
01:46:39,004 --> 01:46:41,097
Crackheads, Verne!

1337
01:46:41,206 --> 01:46:44,505
Crackheads.
Man, they'd do anything for the rock.

1338
01:46:44,609 --> 01:46:47,100
They'd bust you clean
'cross your head for that rock.

1339
01:46:49,481 --> 01:46:52,678
She's a sweet damned mistress.

1340
01:46:52,784 --> 01:46:55,685
Mysterious, like Atlantis.
Sunken crack whores.

1341
01:46:55,787 --> 01:46:58,847
- The bitch is crazy.
- Look, dude, about those
computers you're talking about...

1342
01:46:59,024 --> 01:47:01,390
The computers are inside. Follow me.

1343
01:47:01,526 --> 01:47:03,960
Yeah, I figured they were inside.

1344
01:47:04,996 --> 01:47:06,896
Okay, here's the plan.

1345
01:47:07,032 --> 01:47:09,262
All right. We find out who works 36th Street...

1346
01:47:09,367 --> 01:47:11,528
From Third to Broadway on Wednesday...

1347
01:47:11,636 --> 01:47:14,935
Leonard and Church on Thursday,
bang, we got our garbage man.

1348
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,873
Okay. "personnel, '" "Routes';!
Here we go.

1349
01:47:17,976 --> 01:47:21,377
"Routes" All right
"36th," "Wednesday,"

1350
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,914
- Boom, there we go. We got our man.
- "Anthony Scalia"

1351
01:47:24,015 --> 01:47:26,950
Yep. Same garbage man got both routes.
You see that?

1352
01:47:27,052 --> 01:47:30,647
"Three East 117th Street,
Apartment 4R. '" Yeah. Boom. Let's go.
