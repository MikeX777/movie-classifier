1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,718
Sit down. Come here.

2
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,078
How much for this fighting cock?

3
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,838
One and a half million.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,560
And for that one?

5
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,438
Two million tomans.

6
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,236
Two million.

7
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,755
Mr. Farshid's cock

8
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,911
is at one and a half million.

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,277
Kak Amin's fighter
is at 2 million tomans.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,759
No one says 3 million?

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,796
No

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,678
No one bids higher?

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,114
No.

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,917
I quote the philosopher Kierkegaard:

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,112
"l am not afraid of death

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,159
because when I am here he is not...

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,311
"And when he is here I'm not.

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,519
"No gain or loss
is more important than death."

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,669
What did I say?

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,359
"No gain or loss
is more important than death."

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,197
Music's ready. 3... 2... 1.

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,675
Allo, allo.

23
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,957
Papa, Papa...

24
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,236
What is it?

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,118
It's for you.

26
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,395
Who is it?

27
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,069
Telephone!

28
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,313
Who? Who?

29
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,557
Mamo? Just a second.

30
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,393
It's Mamo.

31
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,629
Who?

32
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,509
Mamo.

33
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,069
Mamo! Quiet! Quiet!

34
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,038
Just a second.

35
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,639
Bring the phone.

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,509
Silence!

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,678
Hello, master. At your service.

38
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,994
Sorry?

39
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,598
At your service.

40
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,155
Yes.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,228
Is it possible?

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,993
Really?
They gave you the authorisation?

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,352
Of course, tomorrow
I'll go pick up your sons

44
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,069
and then we'll join you.

45
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,071
Goodbye everybody.

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,998
My sons will stay to play some music.

47
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,311
Fayegh! Mamo has good news!

48
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,435
I'm not coming.

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,431
But you promised!

50
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,479
Give me the keys to the bus,
I only need it for a week.

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,279
You promised. Give me the keys.

52
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,554
I'll give you these cocks in exchange.
Two of them.

53
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,317
I love them as much
as I love my two children.

54
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,115
Make twice as much with them
as with your bus!

55
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,151
Here take them.

56
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,479
Rent another bus,

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,837
I'll pay you for it when I get back.
Your bus will be famous.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,471
Why? There are a thousand buses!

59
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,633
A thousand. A thousand.

60
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,076
A thousand eyes will be on this bus!
See this camera?

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,313
My friend Nemat gave it to me,
no problem.

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,080
But you,
just to lend me this old wreck,

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,478
one day it's yes, one day it's no.

64
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,949
If you lend it, it's a good deed,

65
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,716
if not, say so straight away
and goodbye.

66
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,351
But I told you that I want it
on Friday for my niece's wedding

67
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,555
to decorate it.

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,553
I give, I don't, I give, I don't.

69
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,871
So don't. I don't care.
You're not human.

70
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,156
But you want my bus for two weeks.

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,270
You know how famous you'll be?

72
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,234
500,000 people are going to come
from different countries to see us.

73
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,029
You know what I'll say
when I'm up there

74
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,153
in front of 500,000 people?

75
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,313
That without you,
there wouldn't be a bus

76
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,277
and we wouldn't even be here today.

77
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,191
You'll be so famous: BBC, CNN...

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,070
In fact, you'll be known all over the
world. How famous you're going to be!

79
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,879
Is that true? Do you promise?

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,871
To God and His prophet.

81
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,039
I'll go crazy, I'll die from joy.

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,556
I agree, but promise me to go
only on asphalt roads

83
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,873
and you'll be careful about bumps.

84
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,995
Whatever you say.

85
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,479
And no dirt roads!

86
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,235
None. I'll take care of it
as if it were my own.

87
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,790
And you swear to change the oil often?

88
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,918
This bus feeds my ten children.

89
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,356
It's Afsaneh!

90
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,036
Get rid of her!

91
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,156
What should I say?

92
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,112
I don't know.

93
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,595
What?

94
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,796
Tell her...Tell her I'm in the toilet.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,309
What? My bus is the toilet?

96
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,677
And you want me to lend you my bus?

97
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,871
Come on get rid of her.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,514
Allo? Allo!

99
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,188
Hello.

100
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,833
It's Miss Afsaneh.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,197
Hello, Miss Afsaneh. How are you?

102
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,835
My God, your wife!

103
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,799
Who was that?

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,955
Good day!

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,634
Shut up! I asked you who that was?

106
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,477
I don't know.

107
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,153
Tell her anything.

108
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,150
It was Kak Amin.

109
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,675
Kak Mohamad Amin, the singer?

110
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,274
It was a woman's voice. Don't kid me.

111
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,954
Who was it! Shame on you.

112
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,351
Let me ask him. Who was this woman?

113
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,469
But what woman? He's lying.

114
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,598
Kak Mohamad Amin had a throat operation
last year.

115
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,557
He sounds like a woman now.

116
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,234
How dare you even open your mouth?

117
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,556
You call yourself a man!

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,228
Shame on you.

119
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,680
Wife! Wife!

120
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,672
#l changed my name to Kako
out of love for Mamo.#

121
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,559
Hello.

122
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,758
I'm Kako, I'm at your service,
at the service of Mamo.

123
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,075
Please put your suitcases in the bus,
I'll help you.

124
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,999
Mamo said eight, but you're only seven!

125
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,229
One isn't coming.

126
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,469
Where is he now?

127
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,073
In his workshop.

128
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,558
Hello, Kak Shouan.

129
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,994
Hello.

130
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,029
Mamo ordered me to come and get you
and then to join him.

131
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,315
So what?

132
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,357
So come and join your brothers.

133
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,592
I told the others I couldn't come.

134
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,196
Even if it's Mamo's order,
I can't come.

135
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,909
What can I do?
I can't stop my work to come.

136
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,555
Kak Shouan, I don't want to insult you.

137
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,354
I have problems,
dear friend, big problems.

138
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,075
If I go, I won't be able to
sell all these instruments.

139
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,276
I can't just close my workshop,
I need to find customers, you know.

140
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,318
You see how cold it is in my workshop.

141
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,198
What's your problem?

142
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,158
I have more problems.
My wife is pregnant.

143
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,833
Science has made much progress.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,876
So?

145
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,271
She's pregnant. So what?
There are doctors.

146
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,070
There are doctors and nurses
but I have a bigger problem.

147
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,032
What is it?

148
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,798
You wouldn't know. Come closer.

149
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,158
Really? I have the solution.

150
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,514
What do you mean?

151
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,795
Really?

152
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,790
No!

153
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,234
Come on, get up.

154
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,952
Come on, we'll see on the way.

155
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,159
I can't believe you.
How can I believe you?

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,994
Gentlemen, welcome to all of you!
Let me turn on the camera.

157
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,513
With your permission.

158
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,954
My dear Sons of Mamo,
we have a long way to lraqi Kurdistan.

159
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,634
For your safety and to save time,

160
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,270
we can't stop in restaurants
along the way.

161
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,150
I've got everything for making tea
in the back of the bus.

162
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,912
Serve yourselves.

163
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,108
I'm sorry, but as I'm driving,
I cannot serve it.

164
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,393
Kako, what's with the cockerel?

165
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,519
I lost his parents in a fight
and as he's an orphan...

166
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,956
I'm waiting for him to grow
to take revenge.

167
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,114
To be safe,

168
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,068
please put your things under the seats.

169
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,512
Hello, Kak Shirkooh. Sorry to be late.

170
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,079
It's OK. He's up there.

171
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,231
Kak Shirkooh...You have permission?

172
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,071
Yes.

173
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,037
Thanks to God.

174
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,991
My seven months of prayers
have been answered. We finally got it.

175
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,358
Kak Shirkooh, can I film you?

176
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,192
Go ahead.

177
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,392
I'm going to film Mamo too.

178
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,791
What a great man!

179
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,671
Hello, Mamo.

180
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,638
Hello, put this flag to one side.

181
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,949
Yes, sir.

182
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,353
Hello, Mamo!

183
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,873
Hello.

184
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,475
And your instruments? Where are they?

185
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,076
Kako told us to hide them
under the seats.

186
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,034
No! Take them out!
They'll let us into lraq.

187
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,751
I worked for seven months
to get the authorisation.

188
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,230
You can take them out
and stow them up top.

189
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,992
Let's go Kako.

190
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,079
Son, send an e-mail to my other sons
in Germany right away.

191
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,276
Doctor Majed and Mansoor.

192
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,714
Yes.

193
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,710
Ask them when they're leaving
and on which plane.

194
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,113
Where are we going now?

195
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,235
To Sortchoo.

196
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,276
Sortchoo?

197
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,475
Why?

198
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,475
Haven't you heard?

199
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,997
The water overflowed from the dam
and flooded a dozen villages.

200
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,276
Senoor transferred her school there.

201
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,390
Any human loss?

202
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,869
None, thanks to God.

203
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,155
Write!

204
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,032
From what e-mail address?

205
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,797
mamokurdistan

206
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,989
@yahoo.com?

207
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,269
Yes.

208
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,313
Teacher! The bus is here.

209
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,276
Over here!

210
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,875
Wait!

211
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,990
Don't go!

212
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,913
Hello, father.
Hello, daughter.

213
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,359
Shall we go?

214
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,236
Hello Mamo.

215
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,189
Could you come down for a moment?
I need to talk to you.

216
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,999
No, let's go. No need to go and talk.

217
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,470
What is it? Did you have a fight?

218
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,114
No. no fight, Mamo.
Please just don't take her.

219
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,478
Come this way please.

220
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,110
First come and see the state we're in.

221
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,990
Dear Mamo, your daughter is ill.
She can't make this trip.

222
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,151
Also, she has all these pupils.

223
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,676
She wouldn't come back
from this trip alive.

224
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,512
Bateen, what is it?

225
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,597
Go. Let us talk.

226
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,471
Why? What are you saying?

227
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,232
Father, I'm OK.

228
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,989
I've been practicing the music
non-stop for seven months.

229
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,639
You feel all right?

230
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,553
I'm all right. He's talking nonsense.

231
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,349
See if I have a fever. I'm fine.

232
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,476
Daughter, you have a fever.

233
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,437
Look! Stand up!

234
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,150
Sit down, sit down children.

235
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,869
They are...

236
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,995
School transfers.

237
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,674
Come on, let's get his autograph.

238
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,234
The floods in Beltchesoor
destroyed a dozen villages.

239
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,030
Their lands, houses, schools,
everything was submerged.

240
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,320
We set up a school here.
They have music lessons as well.

241
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,999
Without Senoor, we cannot do anything.

242
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,709
Enough Bateen. We talked last night.

243
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,630
About what?

244
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,633
We said that I would leave. Let me go.

245
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,676
And these kids?

246
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,751
Accept responsibility for a week.

247
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,115
No. I can't, I can't.

248
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,673
Children, sit down.

249
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,075
Please sit down.

250
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,033
What should I do now?

251
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,149
Whatever you say. It's either
your trip or these poor children.

252
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,038
I'll accept your decision.

253
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,110
Tell one of my sons to come up here.

254
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,038
How many are we with Senoor?

255
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,075
Mamo,

256
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,508
counting Kako and Senoor,
makes fourteen.

257
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,430
What?

258
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,238
Fourteen people.

259
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,993
Dear child,
I don't travel with 14 people.

260
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,553
You can't come.

261
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,914
Why?

262
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,709
14 brings bad luck. I won't go with 14.

263
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,671
Take care of the children.

264
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,715
Sorry Mamo, it's not my business,

265
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,475
But it's 13 that brings bad luck
not 14.

266
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,908
Go away.

267
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,033
It's people like you
that make 13 unlucky.

268
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,919
13 is innocent.
It doesn't bring bad luck.

269
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,595
You should stay
and take care of these children.

270
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,719
You too, take care of the children.
I'm leaving.

271
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,518
Whatever you say.

272
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,757
Goodbye.

273
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,592
Anyway, my dear Senoor...

274
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,034
Yes, dear father.

275
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,638
Don't cry, my dear.

276
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,960
Teach the children that neither 13
nor 14 bring bad luck.

277
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,835
Don't cry. Even dying isn't bad luck.

278
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,910
God bless.

279
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,355
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

280
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,838
Care for these kids,
they're more important.

281
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,238
God bless you.

282
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,228
Mamo!

283
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,793
What?

284
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,239
Miss Senoor should come too.

285
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,633
Senoor! Why?

286
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,756
Well, one son just ran away.

287
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,352
Which one?

288
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,039
Shouan.

289
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,677
Shouan?

290
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,068
Yes, it was Shouan.

291
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,956
Where?

292
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,109
There.

293
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,352
Hey, Shouan.

294
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,389
Don't leave Shouan!

295
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,189
Stop!

296
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,796
Excuse me, if your voice
doesn't reach, use this.

297
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,756
What's this?

298
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,558
I brought it just in case.

299
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,076
"Just in case"?
It better be your last time.

300
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,955
Here, take this! Go now.

301
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,396
Hey, Shouan!

302
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,391
Stop! I'm talking to you. Stop!

303
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,078
Shouan...

304
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,309
Listen to me!

305
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,959
Sorry,

306
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,475
but I gave it to you to frighten him
not to kill him.

307
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,949
I told you to go away.

308
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,113
Stop! Three. Two.

309
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,230
One.

310
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,908
I told you to stop.

311
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,951
Shouan, let me see your ear.
Let me see if it suits you.

312
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,877
Mamo, look at
what you've done to my ear.

313
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,395
Look! I'm sorry,
I'll do whatever you say.

314
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,075
What else do you want?

315
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,318
Coward!

316
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,075
Do you think I came after you
because I'm in love with you?

317
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,710
It's a pity I spent 7 months
practicing with you.

318
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,757
If not, you'd be out.

319
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,831
Now you must come.

320
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,069
You know why?
You look like that foreign painter.

321
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,236
What's his name.
Do you know it, Shouan?

322
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,231
You mean Renoir?

323
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,236
No, no.

324
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,628
Picasso?

325
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,835
No, no.

326
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,989
Rembrandt?

327
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,149
Another one.

328
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,389
Is it the Dutch one?

329
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,994
Yes. What is his name?

330
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,433
Van Gogh.

331
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,831
Yes. That's it.

332
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,799
You look like him.

333
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,670
Tell my father to come down.

334
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,793
Why are you standing there? Come on up!

335
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,838
I must talk to my father.

336
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,876
What is it?

337
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,031
Tell him it's important.

338
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,278
Shaho wants you.

339
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,749
What is it?

340
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,553
What is it, my son?

341
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,152
Hello.

342
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,389
Hello.

343
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,393
We have to talk, but not here.

344
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,959
What?

345
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,036
Come with me.

346
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,596
Why don't you talk here?

347
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,151
You made me come all the way down here,
what do you want to tell me?

348
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,838
Would it be possible
to delay this trip?

349
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,149
What happened?

350
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,351
Last night, I saw the wise man.

351
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,999
What did he say?

352
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,796
He said to tell you
not to make this trip.

353
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,474
He told me

354
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,034
to tell you in secret
not to go on this trip.

355
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,998
Papa, don't go.

356
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,393
What else did he say?

357
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,070
He dreamt something bad will happen
on the 14th night of the lunar month.

358
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,996
The night of the fourteenth?
So what could happen?

359
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,071
I shouldn't do this trip?

360
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,197
Why not? I will make this trip.

361
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,355
Who wants to stop me?

362
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,832
For all these years,
they've stopped my singing.

363
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,232
This time I won't let them!

364
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,437
I have to go, even if it kills me.

365
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,957
Read me the speech text now.

366
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,109
All right.

367
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,758
"Excellencies, dear guests.

368
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,236
It is an honour for me, Mamo, to be
here among you for this splendid night.

369
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,636
As a composer and with my sons,

370
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,992
the first group to play the music
of freedom in free Kurdistan,

371
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,720
after the fall of Saddam.

372
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,749
Here among you, with joy I announce
that after all these years

373
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,912
of oppression of the music
of my country,

374
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,277
we find ourselves here
to listen and to witness

375
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,034
the rebirth of the roots of our music.

376
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,352
To utter a cry of freedom,
of beauty, of life

377
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,876
after the road we've come down.

378
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,999
Surely, a great part of our joy
comes from the overthrow of Saddam

379
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,478
and that after 37 years...

380
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,552
I can again see my occupied motherland

381
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,959
and come with my sons, to present
to you a music of love, friendship,

382
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,874
beauty and life.

383
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,116
A piece called..."

384
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,197
Here I have a problem, Mamo.
What's it called?

385
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,316
I'll say when we're there.

386
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,113
It's very good, but where you
put the name of Mamo and his sons,

387
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,154
add that a celestial voice
will also accompany us.

388
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,038
What do you mean, Mamo?

389
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,992
About a celestial voice
that will accompany us.

390
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,628
Who? Which celestial voice?

391
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,873
A voice that was lost all those years.

392
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,031
I hope not her.

393
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,036
A voice that was killed,

394
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,072
an extinct voice.

395
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,393
Not Hesho!

396
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,949
None of your business. Just write!

397
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,350
But she can't go with no permit.

398
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,790
At the fork, turn left.

399
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,035
Yes, sir.

400
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,069
Turn left.

401
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,269
Be careful.

402
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,550
I told you, turn left.

403
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,314
Mamo,

404
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,554
Mamo. Please don't go.

405
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,793
Leave me alone.
Without her, it can't be.

406
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,439
But so many checkpoints.

407
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,079
Be quiet.

408
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,794
Mamo, I'm begging you.

409
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,993
I'm begging you, please. I beg you.

410
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,879
Don't forget the old man's dream.

411
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,998
With her, they'll throw us all in jail.

412
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,673
It's dangerous for her and us.

413
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,673
I haven't forgotten the danger.

414
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,592
Don't orphan my child too!

415
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,829
Come on, move!

416
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,069
Be quiet.

417
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,634
She can't sing!

418
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,148
She can't sing?
She has a celestial voice

419
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,552
that I can still hear in my head.

420
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,036
Kako, Kako,

421
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,469
give me the gun.

422
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,110
You must show her respect.
For without her,

423
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,671
we are incomplete. Incomplete.

424
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,510
Stop, Mamo. Who are these people?

425
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,676
They're my sons.

426
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,957
Even if that's true,
this is a forbidden area.

427
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,197
They're not strangers. They're my sons.

428
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,589
What's wrong?

429
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,955
You are supposed to come on Mondays.

430
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,113
What's the difference?
Monday, Tuesday, any day...

431
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,748
You get your money, here!

432
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,276
Be careful, don't let it show.

433
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,075
Thank you. But don't forget
that this country has laws.

434
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,630
I know the laws.
Come on, open the gate.

435
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,149
Go ahead.

436
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,749
Goodbye.

437
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,075
You're welcome.

438
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,268
What is this place?

439
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,315
The place where 1334 woman
singers have been exiled.

440
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,595
Who is singing?

441
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,909
It's the voice of all 1334 women
singing. Listen!

442
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,272
It's like the voice of a single woman.
Hesho is here as well.

443
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,757
What are you doing here?

444
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,837
You told me to come with you.

445
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,479
When did I tell you that?

446
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,029
What do I do now?

447
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,873
Go back to your brothers in the bus.

448
00:41:49,880 --> 00:42:00,916
#I'm waiting for the spring to come#

449
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,791
A bit louder.

450
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:15,992
#And colour all the meadows
and mountains.#

451
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,994
It was good. Sing it once more.

452
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,868
It's difficult, Mamo.

453
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,556
It's not difficult.
It's perfect. Sing again.

454
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,878
I can't, Mamo.

455
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,234
You can.

456
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,595
Wonderful, wonderful.

457
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,230
The smoke damages your voice.

458
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,358
Cigarettes have made you sick.

459
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,190
Give me the cigarette.

460
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,754
Let's start again.

461
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,079
You're ready? 3, 2, 1...

462
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,673
More effort.

463
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,193
All right, we've finished this piece.
And this other one as well.

464
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,635
Let's work on the Requiem.

465
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,950
God willing, we'll finish tonight.

466
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,673
Mamo, a checkpoint!

467
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,469
Hide Hesho! Quickly!

468
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,154
Get up, you!

469
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,031
Move fast!

470
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,234
Come on! Quickly!

471
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,433
Hello Captain.

472
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:51,757
Hello, hello.

473
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,109
Where are you going?

474
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,709
God willing to lraqi Kurdistan.

475
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,676
What?

476
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,398
To lraqi Kurdistan.

477
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,678
Iraqi Kurdistan! Your authorisation?

478
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,115
It's with my boss, over there.

479
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,039
Your boss?

480
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,879
You want it?

481
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,033
Great, so you are Mamo!

482
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:27,956
Yes.

483
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,276
Very well. You're very famous now.

484
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,718
On satellite, TV, radio,
they only talk about you these days.

485
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,154
Good. Who are these people?

486
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,117
They're my sons.

487
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,429
They're all your sons?

488
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,589
Yes.

489
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,993
Congratulations, you've a whole
regiment. What's all the mess?

490
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,957
It's their instruments.

491
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,032
Good. What will you do in lraq?

492
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,192
We're going for a concert.

493
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,557
A party, that's good.
What do you have? Opium?

494
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,829
Nothing.

495
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,517
Alcohol?

496
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,315
Nothing. We don't have anything.

497
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,755
What happened to your ear?

498
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,636
It got bitten.

499
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,472
By whom?

500
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,112
Family problem!

501
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,156
Mamo...

502
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,629
Hello, I'm Kurdish, from Kermanshah.

503
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,915
Hello.

504
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,719
With me here, don't worry.

505
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,752
At your service. OK.

506
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,314
My wife!

507
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,915
What? I'm at a police checkpoint!

508
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,919
Yes, a police checkpoint!

509
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,880
What woman's voice? It's my cockerel!

510
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,510
I swear it. The Captain is in here too.

511
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,909
Have a nice trip.

512
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,479
Captain! Excuse me.

513
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,950
It's my wife. She always thinks
I'm cheating on her.

514
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,276
She doesn't believe me.
Could you talk to her?

515
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,998
Put it away and get going.

516
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,269
Did you hear?

517
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,116
What's this dinosaur you have?

518
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,477
Captain this isn't a dinosaur,

519
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,637
it's a cockerel! It's all I have
in this world, it's my love.

520
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,073
Does it have the flu?

521
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,315
What?

522
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,349
Bird flu?

523
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,509
I could get the flu but him, never.
He's hygiene itself.

524
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,354
Well, clean under hygiene's feet!
Get going.

525
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,039
Mamo, we made it.

526
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,195
If you allow, I'll film a bit more.

527
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,599
Do we have another phone number?

528
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,392
Just this one.

529
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,592
Dear Mamo,
we're here at the border eight hours

530
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,955
and no one's come to greet us.

531
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,510
Maybe we're going against destiny.

532
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,796
We should turn around.

533
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,149
Allo!

534
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,308
Heiio?

535
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,158
Can you hear me?

536
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,359
Can you hear me?

537
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,350
Mamo, don't go too far.
It's lraqi territory there.

538
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,798
Come back to this side.
They shoot from the towers.

539
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,349
What are those gunshots?

540
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,272
There's been an ambush.

541
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,994
The road is closed?

542
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,151
Yes, it's closed.

543
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,118
The Americans are shooting
at anything that moves!

544
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,111
What are you carrying?

545
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,554
Corpses.

546
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,992
They are aiming at us.

547
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,310
I said they would shoot at us.

548
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,593
This time you were right.

549
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,117
My son, take your phone.

550
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,835
Don't go on lraqi soil.
Walk on the border.

551
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,268
Be careful.

552
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,752
Police! Mamo, police!

553
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,073
Hide Hesho! Hide her!

554
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,551
My God! Why all these police?

555
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,110
Come forward.

556
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,832
Everybody get out.

557
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,395
You lied to me!

558
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,472
What have we done?

559
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,398
So you don't have anything?
Line up over there.

560
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,753
But what have we done, Captain?

561
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,308
Quiet!

562
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,153
Don't just stand there, search!
Up, down, under, on top...

563
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,752
Your lD papers.

564
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,030
You, OK. ID!

565
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,553
Shut up!

566
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,588
Tell me what we've done!

567
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,591
Yes, why are you arresting us?

568
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,788
Shut up!

569
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,115
Here.

570
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,199
This picture is from childhood.

571
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,149
Your lD papers.

572
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,872
Captain, we searched everywhere
but we found nothing.

573
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,993
Start again. Every centimetre.

574
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,037
Use the dogs trained for women.

575
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,997
Come on, hurry up. Your papers!

576
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,189
Your military papers!

577
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,793
I only have lD.

578
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,110
I need your military papers.

579
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,796
You weren't even born
when I did my military service.

580
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,393
Why are you bothering us?

581
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,239
I'm exempt from the Shah's time.
My eyes.

582
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,395
And your papers?

583
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,272
They're at home.

584
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,318
I don't understand Kurdish!
Speak Farsi!

585
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,158
I've an exemption
from the time of the Shah.

586
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,553
Don't break them!
Why break our instruments?

587
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,837
I can't bear it! Stop!

588
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,953
Quiet. Stay where you are!

589
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,395
What do you do?

590
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,197
I study.

591
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,634
What subject?

592
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,755
Medicine.

593
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,114
Give me your student card.

594
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,273
I don't have it here.

595
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,271
A student is never without it!

596
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,111
I forgot it.

597
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,076
It's true.

598
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,231
It's not your business.
Give me your own lD.

599
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,317
He doesn't have one.

600
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,471
Come here. You two, come here too.

601
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,476
Stand over there.

602
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,709
They don't go through
till they bring their lD cards.

603
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,997
Captain, this one
has an eye exemption.

604
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,879
He did his military in the Shah's time.

605
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,508
We have authorisation. Why bother us?

606
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,434
I don't care. They're not allowed
to go through without their cards.

607
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,189
Mamo, don't get upset.

608
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,273
We're going to go home
and bring our cards.

609
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,199
How are you going to get them?
You'll never make it.

610
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,914
Captain! Please, don't let my sons go!

611
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,909
I have nothing. Please!

612
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,957
You have nothing in the bus?

613
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,634
Nothing. You can check.

614
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,148
That's what we're going to do.
I said quiet.

615
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,514
You're not going to come back!

616
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,394
Captain!

617
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,876
We found her.

618
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,552
Captain, please.

619
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,518
I can't have a concert without her.

620
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,829
She is guilty.

621
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,994
Guilty? What is her crime? Because
she sings? That's why she's guilty?

622
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,789
You talk too much. Be careful
or I'll arrest you all.

623
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,269
Captain, I beg you.

624
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,039
Mamo, stop. Don't do this.

625
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,879
What are you doing?

626
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,550
Come on. Get rid of these people.

627
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,314
Captain, he's Mamo.
All Kurdistan knows him.

628
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,960
They're waiting for him.

629
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,390
Listen, whatever happens, don't let
them cross from lran to lraq.

630
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,551
Get rid of them now.

631
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,557
Captain!

632
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,478
Why beg him? Who is he?

633
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,709
They took my singer.

634
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,919
Move. Step back.

635
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,878
Mamo, I told you I was Kurdish.

636
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,793
Don't worry. I'll fix everything.

637
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,838
I gave my number to your driver.

638
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,999
Come over here.

639
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,758
What do we do now, Mamo?

640
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,152
I'm going to continue on my way!

641
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,709
But the instruments! And Hesho!

642
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,678
You have no instrument, no singer.

643
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,478
Not even a road! Where can you go?

644
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,430
Wherever I go in Kurdistan,
I will find instruments and a singer.

645
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,957
He said he won't let us
cross the border.

646
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,590
How do you want to go?

647
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,588
That's my problem.
Those who want to, come with me.

648
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,239
I'm not feeling well.

649
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,075
I'm telling you,
don't look for excuses.

650
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,358
So if you're ready, get on the bus.

651
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:44,996
Rizgar!

652
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:45,717
Yes?

653
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,995
Bring your laptop.

654
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,149
OK.

655
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,358
See if you can find us a road.

656
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,717
I was searching for one
before you called me.

657
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,877
Both on the map and on internet...

658
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,555
We are...

659
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,915
Look.

660
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,510
There's no possibility

661
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,672
unless we go through
Western Azerbaijan.

662
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,678
It's far, but it's the only way.

663
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,635
From there we can go towards
the Turkish border.

664
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,237
Then there is a village called Soorab.

665
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,949
From Soorab to lraqi Kurdistan,
is half an hour.

666
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:36,757
Soorab?

667
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,592
Kak Khalil's village.

668
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,870
Kak Khalil?

669
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,519
Your friend the musician.

670
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,995
Kak Khalil, my friend.
That's good. Very good.

671
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,309
Why, Mamo?

672
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,719
If we go to his village,
he will find us instruments

673
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,914
and a singer with a beautiful voice
to accompany us.

674
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,999
Great. What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

675
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,628
No, don't hurry.
Why?

676
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,918
The sergeant said to stay.
He said stay in the area.

677
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,035
What for?

678
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,316
I don't know.

679
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,351
Kak Khalil, I'm bringing Mamo
and his sons!

680
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,238
Today! I promise you.

681
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,951
You don't believe me? Mamo is here
a few metres in front of me.

682
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,274
Hello?

683
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,790
Who are you talking to, Kako?

684
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,349
To Kak Khalil.

685
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,231
Who?

686
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:31,917
To Kak Khalil.

687
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,111
What?

688
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,116
He nearly died he was so happy.

689
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,075
You shouldn't have. Come on, let's go.

690
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,792
We have to fix these.

691
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,469
Impossible. I don't know what to do.

692
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,915
Do your best, we have no choice.

693
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,717
But how?

694
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,916
We just have to fix them.

695
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:41,995
#Now, all the world is
full of happiness,#

696
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:50,829
#Only my heart is suffering
from sorrow.#

697
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,272
I can't Mamo, I'm telling you, I can't.

698
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,558
We've been practicing together
for seven months.

699
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,508
I know you can. You're going to
have to work hard.

700
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,154
But you'll manage.

701
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,632
I don't want this money for myself.
It's for four poor soldiers.

702
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,992
40,000 for four soldiers!

703
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,195
So how much then?

704
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,152
4,000.

705
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,878
What do you mean 4,000 tomans?

706
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,195
Don't upset me, just give me 40,000.

707
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,713
What do you mean?

708
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,790
So, how much?

709
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,077
I gave you food. That's 10,000.

710
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,313
You slept in front of the fire
for two hours. That's 10,000.

711
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,358
You took a picture with Mamo
and he gave you an autograph.

712
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,033
Another 10,000.

713
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,995
I gave you something good to drink
as well. Another 10,000.

714
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,152
That makes 40,000.

715
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,079
You realise what I've done? Human
trafficking! And it's her, Hesho!

716
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,189
If they catch me, with this uniform,
you know what they'll do to me?

717
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,634
Execute me!

718
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,917
Mamo, can't you find someone
better than me?

719
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:02,035
My God. What are you saying?
Better than you?

720
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,230
Where? We've been working together
for seven months.

721
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,279
There's no more time.
Where could I find someone?

722
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,668
I'm scared, Mamo.

723
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,877
What's worrying you? Why scared?

724
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,358
That they'll arrest you because of me.
You understand?

725
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,672
You shouldn't be afraid.
We're incomplete without you.

726
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,673
I'm not going on stage without you.

727
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,994
Calm down, don't be afraid.

728
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,554
My sons and I aren't going anywhere
without you.

729
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,039
Do you have money?

730
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,269
Money? Yes.

731
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,509
Your bike?

732
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,193
No, it belongs to the police.

733
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:47,631
No need to count it. Give it to me.

734
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,715
Know why I want the money?

735
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,869
Why?

736
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,517
I'm going to buy petrol for my bus.
I don't have any more money.

737
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,678
Tomorrow, with petrol,
we'll get to Arbil in lraq.

738
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,916
500,000 people.

739
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:06,555
BBC, CNN...Everyone's waiting for me.

740
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,635
I'll tell them that, without the
sergeant-major, we could never make it.

741
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:16,589
Then you'll see, like a bomb,
your name will resonate.

742
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,638
You'll become a world famous
sergeant-major.

743
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,232
Really?

744
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,834
Sure! Here, let me kiss you.

745
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,876
Hurry. The road is dangerous.

746
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,308
Here take this, too.

747
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,914
Hurry up, go!

748
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:16,395
Mamo...

749
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,834
What is it?

750
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,150
Mamo, Hesho...!

751
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:20,957
What?

752
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,918
Hesho is gone!

753
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:24,751
When?

754
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,875
Half hour ago.

755
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,314
You only tell me now?

756
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,597
At night you fell asleep,
Hesho slept in the bus.

757
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,711
I just had a nap by the fire.

758
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,156
I was watching like a guard-dog.

759
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,073
I saw four people standing there
in the fog.

760
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,994
I heard them say: "Ho, hey, ho!"

761
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,037
Four people, four people.

762
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,272
I went forward, I wanted to shoot.

763
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,273
I said: "Who are you?"

764
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,839
They didn't answer.

765
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,833
I wanted to shoot,
but someone tapped my shoulder.

766
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,678
I turned, it was Hesho.

767
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,832
I got scared. Hesho said
to leave them alone.

768
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,395
They came for her
and I was not to follow.

769
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,513
What did you say?

770
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,716
She said they'd come to get her.

771
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,469
Hesho left with them.
I kept calling them. I yelled.

772
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,509
I ran after them, but they took her
and went till they were out of sight.

773
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,477
I lost them in the fog.

774
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,996
But Hesho gave me a piece of paper.

775
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:39,679
#Niwemang, Tangeh Beleh, Kak Khalil.#

776
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,470
Shirkooh, Shirkooh, my son.

777
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,914
Go with Shirkooh.
Get the bus ready, hurry.

778
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,390
What is it?

779
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,431
Hesho is gone.
Go with Kako and don't come back

780
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,158
until you find her. Go.

781
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,915
Go!
I'll wait at Kak Karim's restaurant.

782
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,319
Hello, Mamo.

783
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,872
Welcome, Mamo.

784
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,671
Mamo, how are you?

785
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,713
You are very welcome.

786
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,790
Thank you.

787
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,315
We haven't heard your voice
in a long time.

788
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,993
I was busy.

789
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,310
Sons of Mamo, you are all welcome.

790
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,996
Dear Mamo, what will you drink?

791
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,515
Tea would be fine.

792
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,113
Bring some tea.

793
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,394
And what do you want to eat?

794
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,232
What is there?

795
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,833
There's everything,

796
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,994
eggs, dizi, kebabs, ostrich...

797
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,956
What then?

798
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,030
Eggs and yogurt.

799
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,315
At your service.

800
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,998
Ibrahim, bring some tea!

801
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,111
And bring us eggs and yogurt.

802
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,238
Please everybody,
applause in honour of Mamo!

803
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,349
Put on one of the old tapes!
Mamo and Hesho's!

804
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,749
Mamo

805
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,239
Mamo...

806
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,594
Yes, Kako?

807
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,638
What? What's wrong with you?

808
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,270
I can't talk.

809
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,595
Speak up!

810
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,789
I can't talk.

811
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,075
Kako?

812
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,517
Water, water.

813
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,069
Let me see? What's wrong with you?

814
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:04,631
When you sent me with Shirkooh
to look for Hesho,

815
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,394
we got to the mountain top.

816
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,632
The bus wouldn't go,
so we continued on foot.

817
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,674
We were holding hands
not to lose each other.

818
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,150
Then we saw them.
When we got a better look,

819
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,830
we saw there were five of them
with Hesho.

820
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,673
We were running after them.
But going too slow.

821
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:29,960
It was very strange.
We never managed to catch up with them.

822
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,839
Then Shirkooh let go of me.
He said he'd go another way.

823
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,553
I yelled: "Shirkooh!"

824
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,235
I couldn't find Shirkooh.
I heard wolves, wild animals.

825
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:44,269
It was terrifying.
Worse than any horror story!

826
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,671
The things I saw,
I've never seen before in my life.

827
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,233
What a calamity!
Then I came back to you.

828
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,072
Let's leave, Mamo.

829
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,152
Are you sure this is Soorab?
It looks different, strange.

830
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:52,398
You can be sure that it's here.
We also checked on the map.

831
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:58,915
There's nobody here?

832
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,070
Do you know what day it is?

833
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:09,318
Kak Diaco, this is the day
when two great Kurdish musicians,

834
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:14,429
Kak Khalil and Mamo are to meet.

835
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,628
Do you know what it means? All the
Kurdish channels will buy this film.

836
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:25,158
I'm not saying this
because of the money, all right?

837
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,470
I say it for Kurdish culture.

838
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,273
This is Soorab!

839
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,874
Why is it different?

840
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,514
There's nobody to greet us?

841
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,156
This camera is very advanced. I've been
filming with it for six or seven hours

842
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,796
and the tape never finishes.
It never finishes.

843
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,954
It's advanced? You've filmed
for so long? Let me see it.

844
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,234
Be careful!

845
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,837
Kako! There's no tape in it!

846
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,352
What?

847
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,229
What six or seven hours?
It'll only take 60 minute tapes.

848
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,710
There's no tape. Look.

849
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,991
It beeps when there's no tape.

850
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,038
It's not possible. What did you say?

851
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,953
Who gave it to you?

852
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,678
How could I be so stupid?

853
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,354
It's not important, stop!

854
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,189
Why was I so stupid?

855
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,470
It's alright!

856
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,988
You know how long I've been filming?
And there's nothing!

857
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,032
Oh my God.

858
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,997
Excuse me, old woman!

859
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,594
What is it?

860
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,028
Is this the village of Soorab?

861
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,718
No. It's #Tangeh Baleh.#

862
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,189
What?

863
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,038
#Tangeh Baleh.#

864
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,791
#Tangeh Baleh?#
It's not Kak Khalil's village?

865
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,275
Yes. It's Kak Khalil's village.

866
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,113
How could it be, if it's not Soorab?

867
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:24,156
It's been #Tangeh Baleh#
since the day I was born.

868
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,119
#Tangeh Baleh!#

869
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,389
So what about Kak Khalil? Where is he?

870
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:37,076
Kak Khalil's time has come. He died.

871
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,429
What?

872
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,712
When did he die?

873
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,029
Yesterday afternoon.

874
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,635
Where are the villagers?

875
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,031
They're at the cemetery.

876
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,675
What happened?

877
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,838
I don't know. Yesterday afternoon,

878
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,549
they called my father on the phone.
He spoke.

879
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,070
He was very happy, he was laughing.

880
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:01,791
But as soon as he hung up,
he said: "Allo, Allo" and then he fell.

881
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,748
We don't know what bastard called him.
He kept saying "Mamo".

882
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:13,190
He fell, and we shouted:
"Our dear father."

883
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,909
He entrusted his sons to Mamo.

884
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,475
He was so happy.

885
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,319
Give me the gun!

886
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,316
The "Just in case"?

887
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,754
Yes!

888
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,638
What for, Mamo?

889
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,994
Give me!

890
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:31,990
I don't have it here.

891
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,513
Give me!

892
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,159
I don't have it, Mamo.

893
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,275
Give it to me!

894
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:41,995
You killed my friend.
Why did you call without my permission?

895
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,109
You?

896
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,431
It was him! He killed him.

897
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,559
I swear I didn't want to kill him.
I swear.

898
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,990
Who told you to call him?

899
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,276
Mamo, I didn't kill him.

900
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,596
Didn't I tell you not to call him?

901
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,992
Don't do it, Mamo.

902
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,752
He's a murderer.

903
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:12,595
We'll punish him some other way,
not like this.

904
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,072
Calm down.
Don't kill him on our account.

905
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,435
Mamo, please! Mamo, Mamo, please...

906
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,319
I'm going to die.

907
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,990
Help me.

908
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:35,475
Mamo...

909
01:22:07,698 --> 01:22:09,654
Where are you going? Come back!

910
01:22:09,818 --> 01:22:12,969
The dead has come to life!

911
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:17,928
Have that woman sing again,
to bring the dead back to life.

912
01:22:34,298 --> 01:22:37,051
I can't hear anything.
He's passed away.

913
01:22:37,138 --> 01:22:39,857
God bless the dead.

914
01:22:40,058 --> 01:22:43,255
Doctor, I don't know
if he's dead or alive...

915
01:22:43,418 --> 01:22:47,855
But the woman's voice made him move.
Believe me.

916
01:22:47,898 --> 01:22:52,289
I've worked in this region
for 14 years.

917
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:57,293
They know that with cardiac arrests
they cannot bury without my permission.

918
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,016
Why don't you listen to me?

919
01:22:59,178 --> 01:23:03,217
He's not dead. If that woman sings
he'll come back to life.

920
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,768
What you're saying isn't scientific.

921
01:23:06,818 --> 01:23:10,174
I've already registered 213 deaths.
This makes 214.

922
01:23:10,378 --> 01:23:13,211
Doctor,
science can't explain everything.

923
01:23:13,538 --> 01:23:16,132
Some things come from the heart
and the supernatural.

924
01:23:16,178 --> 01:23:18,738
Do you understand?

925
01:23:18,898 --> 01:23:24,336
That woman's voice can make him
move again. Believe me.

926
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:29,772
I have work to do. As far as
I'm concerned, he's dead. Bury him.

927
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,291
Goodbye.

928
01:23:37,978 --> 01:23:40,572
Sons of Kak Khalil!

929
01:23:41,658 --> 01:23:43,011
Yes?

930
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:46,733
We came here so that your father
could find us instruments

931
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:50,772
and a singer with a beautiful voice.

932
01:23:50,938 --> 01:23:53,088
Our father didn't say anything.

933
01:23:53,258 --> 01:23:54,691
What should I do now?

934
01:23:54,858 --> 01:23:58,453
We can find instruments,
if you spend the night.

935
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:01,132
But for a singer, we can do nothing.

936
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:05,894
Spend the night here. I'll tell
my brothers to find instruments.

937
01:24:06,058 --> 01:24:09,175
I don't have time. I need a singer.

938
01:24:09,338 --> 01:24:15,777
Sorry about the singer.
But that's just impossible.

939
01:24:48,378 --> 01:24:49,857
My sons!

940
01:24:55,698 --> 01:24:57,529
Throw dirt on me!

941
01:24:57,698 --> 01:25:00,132
What? Come out of there.

942
01:25:00,258 --> 01:25:03,614
Cover me. I can't take anymore.

943
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:07,892
Dear father, come out.
Tomorrow it will be OK.

944
01:25:08,058 --> 01:25:10,526
Throw it, I have no more time.

945
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:14,850
Father, we still have a bit of honour.

946
01:25:15,018 --> 01:25:16,656
Don't take it from us.
I'm talking to you!

947
01:25:16,818 --> 01:25:19,935
Father, come out.

948
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:23,050
I said throw some earth.
I can't go any further.

949
01:25:27,138 --> 01:25:31,416
Hurry and throw some dirt on me.
My time has come.

950
01:26:20,578 --> 01:26:24,048
My God! My God.

951
01:26:24,898 --> 01:26:27,287
Mamo, one of your sons is missing.

952
01:26:29,098 --> 01:26:32,534
Where is Shahoo?

953
01:26:32,578 --> 01:26:35,968
It's true, he's not here.
We forgot him.

954
01:27:03,178 --> 01:27:06,614
There is a fork in the road!

955
01:27:07,378 --> 01:27:11,257
To the right, it says lraq and Turkey

956
01:27:11,418 --> 01:27:15,093
and to the left, it says lran.
What should I do?

957
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:18,166
Which way do I go?

958
01:27:19,418 --> 01:27:20,533
To the left.

959
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:22,097
Why?

960
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:24,171
To the left.

961
01:28:14,578 --> 01:28:17,376
My God! What happened!

962
01:28:33,778 --> 01:28:36,690
This is Mamo and his sons' bus,
isn't it?

963
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:39,008
Why, Miss?

964
01:28:39,178 --> 01:28:40,133
Where is Mamo?

965
01:28:40,298 --> 01:28:41,492
Where are you from?

966
01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:43,171
I said where is Mamo?

967
01:28:43,378 --> 01:28:44,936
He's in the back.

968
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:49,051
My God! Who is she?

969
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:12,934
Hello.
How are you, Mamo?

970
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:14,213
My child.

971
01:29:17,778 --> 01:29:18,574
Hello.

972
01:29:18,778 --> 01:29:22,851
Hello, everybody.

973
01:29:24,138 --> 01:29:28,290
Dear Mamo, I was told to come
and help you get to Arbil in lraq.

974
01:29:33,338 --> 01:29:35,135
You're not well.

975
01:29:36,498 --> 01:29:38,295
Who sent you?

976
01:29:39,098 --> 01:29:43,137
I will tell you later.
Why are you returning to lran?

977
01:29:43,338 --> 01:29:45,806
Don't you have a concert tonight?

978
01:29:46,138 --> 01:29:49,210
We don't have time.
We'll never make it.

979
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:50,534
Why?

980
01:29:50,738 --> 01:29:55,414
We have no instruments, no woman singer
I have practiced with.

981
01:29:55,578 --> 01:29:57,887
I will be your singer!

982
01:29:58,658 --> 01:30:02,970
You sing? How's your voice?

983
01:30:03,138 --> 01:30:05,015
You've heard it before.

984
01:30:05,138 --> 01:30:06,457
Where?

985
01:30:06,618 --> 01:30:08,131
In the cemetery!

986
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:12,729
It was you? My God!

987
01:30:12,898 --> 01:30:14,331
Go the other way!

988
01:30:59,058 --> 01:31:03,609
Everybody come down.
A bit faster please.

989
01:31:08,498 --> 01:31:09,613
Quickly.

990
01:31:15,818 --> 01:31:18,855
Welcome. This is the Turkish border.

991
01:31:19,018 --> 01:31:23,250
Put your bags in the truck
and your instruments in the coffin.

992
01:31:23,418 --> 01:31:26,490
They will go by the main road
by motorcycle.

993
01:31:26,658 --> 01:31:30,128
We also have a death certificate
for the coffin. Come on.

994
01:31:30,178 --> 01:31:33,568
Why? What will you do with us?

995
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,217
Who organised this?

996
01:31:35,418 --> 01:31:36,487
Me.

997
01:31:36,698 --> 01:31:38,018
Why trust you?

998
01:31:38,018 --> 01:31:39,292
Trust me!

999
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:43,895
Listen to her, my sons.
Do what she says.

1000
01:31:44,738 --> 01:31:47,047
Please listen to her.

1001
01:31:47,618 --> 01:31:49,210
Mamo, let's go.

1002
01:32:05,658 --> 01:32:07,330
Why are you standing there?

1003
01:32:37,178 --> 01:32:38,247
Hurry up.

1004
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:40,688
Hurry, don't waste any time.

1005
01:32:45,098 --> 01:32:48,374
Where are we going? Where?

1006
01:32:48,538 --> 01:32:51,371
I told you we're going together.

1007
01:32:52,218 --> 01:32:54,015
Where will we meet?

1008
01:32:54,218 --> 01:32:56,652
They all know where to go.

1009
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:06,733
Don't part me from them.
Let me go.

1010
01:33:06,778 --> 01:33:10,407
No, Mamo.

1011
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:14,053
Do whatever you must.
But just take us to our destination.

1012
01:33:14,218 --> 01:33:15,207
All right.

1013
01:33:15,418 --> 01:33:17,852
Turkish Border Guards!

1014
01:33:18,018 --> 01:33:21,055
Let's run!

1015
01:33:34,378 --> 01:33:36,096
What do I do, Mamo?

1016
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:40,571
You go back.
You cannot come with the bus.

1017
01:33:40,738 --> 01:33:43,377
Go back.

1018
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:46,052
But Mamo. I've come all this way.
How can I go back?

1019
01:33:46,218 --> 01:33:48,573
It's the Turkish border here.

1020
01:33:48,738 --> 01:33:50,057
It's dangerous.

1021
01:33:50,258 --> 01:33:53,967
For God's sake, Mamo. Don't leave me.

1022
01:33:56,098 --> 01:34:03,049
Don't leave me here.

1023
01:34:05,298 --> 01:34:15,333
#The earth's yellowness
is autumn's blunder#

1024
01:34:15,498 --> 01:34:28,810
#And the yellowness of my heart
is the burden of my beloved's absence.#

1025
01:34:28,978 --> 01:34:30,206
Where did you learn this?

1026
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:32,414
I've practiced for seven months.

1027
01:34:33,178 --> 01:34:35,134
Did your parents sing?

1028
01:34:35,178 --> 01:34:36,691
They say my mother did.

1029
01:34:36,738 --> 01:34:38,217
What's her name?

1030
01:34:38,378 --> 01:34:39,493
I don't know.

1031
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:46,691
Come on.

1032
01:34:47,858 --> 01:34:51,089
Let's go.

1033
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,929
Mamo! Please get up, Mamo. Let's go.

1034
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:43,135
You have to hold on, Mamo.
There isn't far to go.

1035
01:35:54,018 --> 01:35:58,011
It's late, Mamo. Let's go.

1036
01:35:59,178 --> 01:36:02,534
I can't. I can't do it anymore.

1037
01:36:02,698 --> 01:36:04,256
What? Get up!

1038
01:36:06,058 --> 01:36:12,247
Tell me who you are.
Where are you taking me? Leave me.

1039
01:36:12,418 --> 01:36:14,978
Don't say that. Get up.

1040
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,896
Don't cry, and don't be afraid.

1041
01:36:22,098 --> 01:36:24,896
Don't let my sons go without me.

1042
01:36:26,218 --> 01:36:27,492
All right.

1043
01:36:27,858 --> 01:36:31,976
Please. Dead or alive,
take me on the stage.

1044
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:33,567
All right.

1045
01:36:34,298 --> 01:36:35,777
Promise me.

1046
01:36:35,938 --> 01:36:40,090
I promise. Let's go.

1047
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:47,732
What is your name?

1048
01:36:47,898 --> 01:36:49,126
Papoola (Butterfly).

1049
01:36:49,578 --> 01:36:50,454
What?

1050
01:36:50,618 --> 01:36:54,088
Papoola. They found me on the border.

1051
01:36:54,258 --> 01:36:56,818
I was little and called NlWEMANG.

1052
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:58,573
What?

1053
01:36:59,178 --> 01:37:00,577
Niwemang (Half-moon).

1054
01:37:01,218 --> 01:37:04,176
It's late, Mamo. Let's go.

1055
01:37:04,378 --> 01:37:07,176
What did you say?
Niwemang!

1056
01:37:15,578 --> 01:37:18,490
What a mistake I made!

1057
01:37:39,218 --> 01:37:42,608
What are you doing here?
Why are you crying?

1058
01:37:42,778 --> 01:37:44,848
I couldn't resist.

1059
01:37:46,418 --> 01:37:50,934
Me, my cockerel and my camera,
we got inside that coffin.

1060
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:52,929
The truck started moving.

1061
01:37:53,138 --> 01:37:55,333
Then I heard somebody speaking
in Turkish.

1062
01:38:04,658 --> 01:38:06,171
What do you want to do with me?

1063
01:38:10,538 --> 01:38:12,176
What do you want with me?

1064
01:38:18,738 --> 01:38:21,377
Nothing, my dear Mamo.

1065
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:24,052
Whatever you do, don't let my sons
go without me.

1066
01:38:24,818 --> 01:38:25,853
I promise you.

1067
01:38:26,018 --> 01:38:29,090
And you promised to take me
onstage dead or alive.

1068
01:38:33,138 --> 01:38:42,171
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone.

1069
01:38:44,178 --> 01:38:46,328
All right, Mamo, all right.

1070
01:38:55,618 --> 01:38:59,372
Suddenly the coffin opened
and I saw four Turkish police above me.

1071
01:39:00,858 --> 01:39:05,090
I don't know Turkish.
The only words I could remember,

1072
01:39:06,058 --> 01:39:09,095
were "Seni seviyorum" (l love you).

1073
01:39:09,258 --> 01:39:13,012
I forgot the meaning.
They nearly beat me to death.

1074
01:39:13,738 --> 01:39:14,727
And then?

1075
01:39:14,898 --> 01:39:18,288
They kicked me, hit me with chains!
Look what they did.

1076
01:39:18,498 --> 01:39:21,854
They took my coat. They took my camera.

1077
01:39:21,898 --> 01:39:25,174
They shaved my beautiful hair.

1078
01:39:25,338 --> 01:39:28,489
One of them chopped
my cockerel's head off.

1079
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:30,728
He said it had bird flu.

1080
01:39:30,898 --> 01:39:35,653
He made kebabs with it
and ate it right in front of me.

1081
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:39,493
Another one took
all of Mamo's instruments

1082
01:39:39,658 --> 01:39:42,252
and broke and burned them.
He broke them all.

1083
01:39:42,418 --> 01:39:45,569
What am I going to tell Mamo?

1084
01:39:52,298 --> 01:39:53,970
Where are the others?

1085
01:39:55,538 --> 01:39:58,291
When you sent us on bikes
to come to the lraqi border,

1086
01:39:58,338 --> 01:40:01,057
Turkish soldiers shot
and hit my brother.

1087
01:40:01,218 --> 01:40:04,130
Another brother took him back to lran.

1088
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:05,413
I understand.

1089
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:20,929
Go with them, quickly.
They'll let you cross into lraq here.

1090
01:40:23,018 --> 01:40:24,087
Where is Mamo?

1091
01:40:25,258 --> 01:40:28,853
You come with me.
We have to go by another road.

1092
01:40:29,058 --> 01:40:30,377
And our father?

1093
01:40:30,538 --> 01:40:32,017
He's waiting for me.

1094
01:40:32,178 --> 01:40:35,454
Meet us outside the concert hall
in Arbil.

1095
01:40:35,618 --> 01:40:37,495
What are you talking about?

1096
01:40:37,658 --> 01:40:42,368
Our laptop with all the notes
and information fell in a ravine.

1097
01:40:42,538 --> 01:40:46,053
Plus we have no instruments
and no singer.

1098
01:40:46,218 --> 01:40:48,095
How can we give a concert?

1099
01:40:48,258 --> 01:40:51,534
Musicians are waiting there,
everything is ready.

1100
01:40:52,058 --> 01:40:53,047
Let's go.

1101
01:40:53,218 --> 01:40:57,257
The concert is in four hours,
don't waste any time.

1102
01:40:58,378 --> 01:40:59,447
Come!

1103
01:41:01,058 --> 01:41:03,128
And me? What should I do?

1104
01:41:04,538 --> 01:41:06,051
You go with them too.

1105
01:41:06,218 --> 01:41:07,571
Go!
