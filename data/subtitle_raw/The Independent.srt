1
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,524
As we enter the final week

2
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,842
of this historic
three-horse race.

3
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,719
I'm surrounded
by passionate supporters

4
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,429
of a candidate
who burst onto the scene

5
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,782
- no more than five months ago.
- Lucas.

6
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,598
Hey.

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,766
Did you find him?

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,185
Uh, no. Not yet.

9
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,627
Where are you?

10
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,271
I'm by ATB.

11
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,624
A story unheard of

12
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,733
in the history
of American politics.

13
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,860
One year ago,
former gold medalist,

14
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,779
Nate Sterling,
took the political world

15
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,783
by surprise and by storm
with his best-selling manifesto,

16
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,828
a Declaration of Independence,
a modern-day common sense.

17
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,872
Here we
are at Nate Sterling's biggest rally yet.

18
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,625
The independent candidate
has created a tsunami,

19
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,461
thrashing its way through
America's two-party landscape

20
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,506
as he leads Republican nominee
Patricia Turnbull by two points

21
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,591
with just one week to go.

22
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,802
The senior senator
from Tennessee beat out ten

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,263
of her fellow Republicans
in the primary

24
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,824
by courting both the moderate
and far left.

25
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,848
President Archer will need

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,744
to pull off a miracle
to have any hope of securing

27
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,768
a second term.

28
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,789
With an approval rating
in the basement,

29
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,832
some are calling
the Democratic incumbent

30
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,856
a sitting duck.

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
He's about to do a hit

32
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,716
on Politics Nightly
with Jane Bower.

33
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,930
Nate Sterling is set

34
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,673
to take the stage
any minute now.

35
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,977
Shit.
Call back when you get him.

36
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,010
But until
then, I'm pleased to welcome

37
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,394
Nicholas Booker,
esteemed columnist

38
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,722
for the Washington Chronicle
and lion of the fourth state.

39
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,830
Oh!

40
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,290
You're too kind, Jane.

41
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,182
The election is a dead heat.

42
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,346
If it's anything
like the last two elections,

43
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,103
it could come down
to a few thousand votes

44
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,842
and a handful of swing states,
or if it's a repeat of 2000,

45
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,844
a few hundred votes.

46
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,597
Your column is read
by a few million.

47
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,015
Your readers
really listen to you.

48
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,266
They trust you.

49
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,726
I call it like I see it.

50
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,768
What do you see here?

51
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,300
Well, I have good news
and bad news.

52
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,551
Which do you want first?

53
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,303
Bad news!

54
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,597
Right! Always
the bad. Here it is.

55
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,603
My little girl
turned 21 yesterday.

56
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,776
And the first thing Alison did
was make sure

57
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,361
her voter registration
was current.

58
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,742
Ah, 21 years.

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,388
Those of you with kids,
you know how fast

60
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,913
the time goes.

61
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,891
And as I looked at those
candles flickering on top

62
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,917
of that birthday cake,
it brought me back

63
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,335
to the big moments of her life.

64
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,713
Her first words,

65
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,589
her first steps,
her first day of school.

66
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,467
But then my mind wandered

67
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,035
to all she's seen
in her young life.

68
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,473
Terror reaching our shores.

69
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,562
Two long and costly wars.
A great recession.

70
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,105
A deadly global pandemic.

71
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,940
Classrooms getting shot up
every other month.

72
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,400
Climate getting harsher
by the day.

73
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,693
Yeah!

74
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,904
Our very capitol,
the people's house, under siege.

75
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,926
- Yes!
- And the sad truth

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,578
is one party fuels this rage
while the other sits

77
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,979
on their hands
and whines about it.

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,790
Now, you want the good news?

79
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,832
Yeah!

80
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,502
The good news is

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,672
my daughter Alison
turned 21 yesterday.

82
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,841
And as she blew out

83
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,070
those candles on top
of that cake,

84
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,095
a funny thing happened.

85
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,972
The flames reignited.

86
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,475
So, she blew 'em out again.

87
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,702
And then the flames came back
again.

88
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,353
And no matter
how hard she tried,

89
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,794
she couldn't blow
those candles out.

90
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,523
And that made me think
two things.

91
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,152
One, my wife
has a wonderful sense of humor.

92
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,112
And two,

93
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,908
just like those candles,
we always come back.

94
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,701
America always comes back.

95
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,955
And we have to dig deep
and do it again.

96
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,168
Because Alison deserves better.
Our young people deserve better.

97
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,462
They deserve to look forward
to the future

98
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,549
the way we used to, with hope,
with pride, with excitement.

99
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,843
There's no more time
for cruelty or fear.

100
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,055
There's no more time
for incompetence or inaction.

101
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:51,101
Their time is up!
Our time is now!

102
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,436
America's time is now!

103
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,022
And if you stand with me,

104
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,024
and you vote for me,
and you keep fighting

105
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,734
for real change with me,

106
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,739
I promise we will get
our fire back, too.

107
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,917
Now, let me tell you
how we're gonna do it.

108
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,739
The
general election is finally upon us.

109
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,432
And once again, we're forced
to choose

110
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,934
between the lesser of two evils.

111
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,020
On one side,
a Democrat in decline,

112
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,563
and on the other,

113
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,734
a Republican in the pockets
of corporate America.

114
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,069
Oh, boy, our country is mired
in a recession,

115
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,864
the whole world's on fire,
and these are the best

116
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,033
two people we can come up with?
I mean, come on!

117
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,785
Good luck, everyone.
We're going to need it.

118
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,203
Good news!

119
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,081
We've been bought again.

120
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,459
As I'm sure, some of you
have already heard,

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,587
Mr. Jack Hampton
is our newest overlord.

122
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,923
Of course, I'm gonna try
to minimize the casualties,

123
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,508
but it's no secret,

124
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,220
our readership
is, uh, spreading thin.

125
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,223
If we hope to compete,
we're gonna have to get down

126
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,476
in the mud with the pigs.

127
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,520
And how low does Mr. Hampton
want us to go?

128
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,606
Conspiracy clickbait?

129
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,067
Ten thousand words
on celebrity pets?

130
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,736
We have to evolve.

131
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,279
The only reason
we're not worm feed

132
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,115
like half the other papers
in this godforsaken country

133
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,826
is because we do not stop
to tread water.

134
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,080
If we don't keep swimmin',
we die.

135
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,164
You.

136
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,958
I'm looking for new,
innovative ideas.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,545
Something that will ensure
that we are all still employed

138
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,130
come Labor Day. Hmm?

139
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,800
We need to win the battle
for Millenials and Gen Z.

140
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,302
- Uh-huh.
- We... we program around the Facebook algorithm.

141
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,054
Expand
our social media presence.

142
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,098
He, whose name I don't care

143
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,767
to learn, seems to think
that because I've got grandkids

144
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,269
born before the Internet,
I don't know

145
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,522
that we need to expand.
Of course.

146
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,900
I have got a whole
fucking sweatshop

147
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,695
working like a Russian
troll farm to expand

148
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,988
our social media presence. Okay?

149
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,241
I've also got an army
of halfwits

150
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,659
twice as smart as you...

151
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,077
A high school in West Virginia

152
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,912
is going
to a four-day school week,

153
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,163
because of budget cuts.

154
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,581
I had a call
with the principal...

155
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,583
And how's that gonna sell
papers?

156
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,002
I thought

157
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,629
I mean, cutting a whole day
out of the school week...

158
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,964
What percentage

159
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,842
of our readership do you think
has ever set foot

160
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,176
in West Virginia?

161
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,971
And as for the banjo-pickers
themselves,

162
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,017
if it ain't Fox or Infowars,
they ain't readin' it.

163
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,120
Well, maybe that's why
they don't read the Chronicle.

164
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,287
They got a point
calling themselves

165
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,647
the forgotten people
and calling us

166
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,733
condescending coastal elitists.

167
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,864
We are elite.

168
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,341
And if you don't start
acting like it,

169
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,576
you're gonna be a forgotten
person before you know it.

170
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,996
The school in question
is 90 percent minority.

171
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,874
It's gonna make
the achievement gap even wider.

172
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,334
Of course,
the private school kids

173
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,175
- are gonna be just fine.
- What else?

174
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,796
Hmm?

175
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,341
Nate Sterling.

176
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,718
Ah. You again.

177
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,928
I hear he's jumping
into the race next week.

178
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,097
And you think
I haven't heard those rumors?

179
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,099
It's bullshit.
It's publicity for his book.

180
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,642
My source on the ground says

181
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,354
he just hired Kathy Gibbs
as his campaign manager.

182
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,903
Independents. They're like bees.

183
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,072
Once they sting, they die.

184
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,116
If he does announce,
he might buzz around

185
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,702
the honey jar for a week
or two, but nobody outside

186
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,245
the two-party system
has ever cracked

187
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,705
20 percent of the poles.

188
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,891
Now, it'd be a fool's errand.

189
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,917
His camp secretly hired

190
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,212
a pollster to test his numbers
against potential nominees.

191
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,006
When Turnbull secured the bid,
they saw a real opening

192
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,168
for an independent like him.

193
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:52,717
They know he's gonna have to
thread the needle,

194
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,636
but it's not impossible.

195
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,806
So, what are you suggesting?

196
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,769
We get in early.

197
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,145
Prep a cover feature.

198
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,939
The wave is coming
with this guy.

199
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,691
We may as well paddle out
to the break.

200
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,111
Tell me why I would waste
my front page on this neophyte?

201
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,823
Are you referring to me
or Sterling, sir?

202
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,366
Both.

203
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,703
You willing to bet your job
on this fever dream of yours?

204
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,122
If we short him, we'll be
kicking ourselves later.

205
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,974
But if we're early to the
party, we might just sell

206
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,309
enough papers
to give the Russian trolls

207
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,085
an extra ten minutes
on their lunch break.

208
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,171
Hmm.

209
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,051
Fuck it.

210
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,679
How can I fold
when a wounded cub is all in?

211
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,142
Ackerman, you take the reins
on the Sterling feature.

212
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,435
Choose your own co-pilot.

213
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,686
I'll take Conrad.

214
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,863
So, you're gonna give me
the source of Sterling's camp?

215
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,718
Look, look, look, look.
I get it. I get it. All right?

216
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,995
You wanted that story.
And that was a valiant effort.

217
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,915
It was. But, you know,
karma is still a bitch.

218
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,751
And so am I.

219
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,085
Come on. Look.

220
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,813
It's a hard time for guys
like me right now.

221
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:11,421
I mean, look around you.

222
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,714
Oh, come on.

223
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,465
A little awareness maybe...

224
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,966
Okay. Thanks.

225
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,093
Make up your mind.

226
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,180
Either you're a victim
or a big shot.

227
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,183
Kid gets to scoop Ackerman's
shit on his first cover story.

228
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,810
And suddenly,
he's schizophrenic.

229
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,972
No. I was just...

230
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,028
Were you just thanking Eli
for the opportunity?

231
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,232
Yeah.

232
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,240
I never liked that arrogant
little boat shoe.

233
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,330
Email me the best thing
you've ever written.

234
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,398
Which piece did you send him?

235
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,383
The Honduran refugee one?

236
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,968
- Yeah.
- Holy shit. He is gonna love it.

237
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,430
What?

238
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,472
Nothing.

239
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,395
What is this?

240
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,192
Now, when did you have time to...

241
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,569
You've been working so hard,
I thought,

242
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,239
"He deserves the finest grape
Safeway has on offer."

243
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,782
Mm.

244
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,250
Penny ships off tomorrow.

245
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,003
So, if my mom breaks down
in tears, don't be too alarmed.

246
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,462
Your mom? What about you?

247
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,213
Remember the last time
she deployed?

248
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,257
That's smart, buddy.

249
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,259
Ooh!

250
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,468
- Hi.
- Hello.

251
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,386
Hey.

252
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,848
To my beautiful daughters.

253
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,433
Penelope and Elisha.

254
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,102
One makes the news
and one reports it.

255
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,356
Oh, wow.
You make it sound so romantic.

256
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,608
Most days, I just stand
by the printer

257
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,402
and get paper cuts.

258
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,463
Well, you accepted the risk
when you signed up for the job.

259
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,506
Why don't you just go AWOL,

260
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,990
and come bunk up with me
and Lucas?

261
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,283
That'd be fun.

262
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,468
As long as you're cool
with harboring a deserter

263
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,952
with a warrant
out for her arrest.

264
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,454
Let's change the subject,
shall we?

265
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,165
- Eli has some breaking news.
- Oh.

266
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,917
She managed to get on the radar
of one Nicholas Booker.

267
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,919
Nicholas Booker, huh?

268
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,421
See, now that's what you need.

269
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,964
Your own opinion column.

270
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,592
I'm not on the Daily Tar Heel
anymore, dad.

271
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,136
Columns don't just drop out
of thin air at the Chronicle.

272
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,472
Well, you wanna have a real
impact.

273
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,308
Change minds. You need a pulpit.

274
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,895
A column in the Chronicle
is like the pope's balcony

275
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,581
- for Christ's sake.
- I'm working on it, daddy.

276
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,149
I'm just saying it might take
a couple decades. That's all.

277
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,028
The Dalai Lama was a god-king
at 2.

278
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,279
Man has a point.

279
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,573
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,367
Mm. Wow.

281
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,243
Does the man know
that religion and politics

282
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,637
are about the only two topics
to avoid

283
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,913
when you got a dinner guest?

284
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,664
Who, Lucas?

285
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,333
He's practically family.

286
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,211
Speaking of, when are you two
gonna make that official?

287
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,328
Have you got any
new additions to your collection?

288
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,092
- No, but wait. When are we gonna make it official?
- No, no, no. This is important.

289
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,759
Right.

290
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,894
You know, I never asked you,
which one was your first?

291
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,647
The day we realized

292
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,109
the government had been lying
to us all along,

293
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,653
sending me and my friends
halfway around the world

294
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,446
to kill and be killed.

295
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,117
Years after, Nixon knew the war
was unwinnable.

296
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,410
Do you have a favorite?

297
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,495
He did before it was retracted.

298
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,372
That's what
happens when you play fast.

299
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,915
I wasn't playing, dad.

300
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,459
He played me.
There's a difference.

301
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,045
Sweetheart,
you let yourself get played.

302
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,714
Why don't you all come in here,

303
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,590
so we can give Penny
a proper send-off?

304
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,247
He's in meetings
all day, but I can give you his card.

305
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,147
Thanks.

306
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,566
Oh, there he goes right now.

307
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,984
That'll be on Saturday's draw.

308
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,152
Thank you, Sharon.

309
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,196
Mr. Mayfield.

310
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,407
Eli James, Washington Chronicle.

311
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,075
You're the one
who keeps calling.

312
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,243
I'm doing a story

313
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,637
on drastic cuts
in public school budgets,

314
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,180
- and it's my understanding that...
- I'm sorry.

315
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,289
I'm late for a meeting.

316
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,297
Our boys looked good this year.

317
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,939
We play like we did
against the Tar Heels

318
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,277
in the ACC final, we might
really have a shot next year.

319
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,177
You're a Blue Devil?

320
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,179
Yes, sir. Class of '08.

321
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,223
Ah. Well, I got a few decades
on you as you can...

322
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,059
Bowties never go out of fashion.

323
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,644
Listen, I gotta ask,

324
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,730
how has the recession
affected your jackpots?

325
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,357
Oh, as it affected all of us.

326
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,358
The numbers might have dipped
but...

327
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,626
Well, I would have thought that

328
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,694
jackpots would rise in the
recession.

329
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,945
How's that?

330
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,156
You know, a lot
more desperate daydreamers.

331
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,660
I think you mean grown adults
and valued customers.

332
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,790
You should go grab a ticket
yourself.

333
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,625
Gotta be in it to win it.

334
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,104
8:00 p.m. tonight at The Monaco.

335
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,272
If you're not early,
you're late.

336
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,040
I don't have time
for pleasantries.

337
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,084
I've got a hit on CNN
at 10:00 p.m.

338
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,254
What are you staring at?

339
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,090
I'm sorry. I just have read
every single one of your columns

340
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,235
- since I was in seventh grade...
- I don't need idol worship.

341
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,137
I need something else from you.
Sit down.

342
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,184
I'm getting out.

343
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,329
As soon as this election's
over, I'm turning in my quill,

344
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,438
and moving to the country.

345
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,274
What? No, you can't retire yet.

346
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,567
Who are you, my accountant?

347
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:07,068
Well, what good are you
gonna do out in retirement?

348
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,022
I'll bury myself in Bourbon.

349
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,559
I can read fiction for a change.

350
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,407
And I might even watch golf
on Sundays.

351
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,742
Institutions are crumbling.

352
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,535
Okay? Reality is under attack.

353
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,288
You're one of the only voices
whCome on. Come on...

354
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,458
Tweets with cats boxing yarn
get more eyeballs

355
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,460
than a column these days.

356
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,086
I've had a good run.

357
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,256
But what journalism's become,
I'm done with it.

358
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,736
There's a reason they tell you
not to meet your heroes.

359
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,428
Then why did you invite me here?

360
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,263
Mr. Booker!

361
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,306
And how are we tonight?

362
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,808
Ah! Can't complain, Enrique.

363
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,685
Isn't that your job, sir?

364
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,354
Best steak in town.

365
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,748
Only reason I allow him
to get away

366
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:44,874
with being such a smart ass.

367
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,110
Oh, right. Um,

368
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,613
I

369
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,450
I'll just have the house salad.

370
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,828
Bring us two rib-eye.

371
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,163
Rare?

372
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,498
Bloody.

373
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,125
Rule number one,
you want the rib-eye,

374
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,293
get the rib-eye.

375
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,344
And that's the last time
I'm doing it for you.

376
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,632
Excuse me, Enrique?

377
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,177
Give me the house salad.

378
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,430
And the lobster tail.

379
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,807
And may I?

380
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:25,146
A bottle of the '04 Chablis.
Feels like a good vintage.

381
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,277
- How are you?
- Oh.

382
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,445
Lovely to see you.

383
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,780
Hi, Gregg.

384
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,907
Oh, fuck me. She's coming over.

385
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,578
Who are you?

386
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,166
- Eli James. Pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure.

387
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,584
Your campaign finance bill

388
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,294
proved quite the battle,
Senator.

389
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,422
Passed just in time
for the run-up to the generals.

390
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,673
Flawless orchestration.

391
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,675
Nicky never was one
for small talk.

392
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,468
I gave you a gold star

393
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,595
for pulling your party
out of the insane asylum,

394
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,514
- but this bill...
- Good bill, Nick.

395
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,308
It's Citizens United on meth.

396
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,477
First, corporations,
and now, individuals?

397
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,938
Oh! She's feisty, this one.

398
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,523
But she's not wrong.

399
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,836
How many of your billionaire
boy toys are bidding a path

400
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,620
towards your bedroom
door now that you've cut

401
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,006
the chastity belt
off their checkbooks?

402
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,866
Before you go defaming the FSCA,

403
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,535
you might want to look up
the word, freedom,

404
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,203
in your pocket dictionary.

405
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:22,871
Turns out, people like it.

406
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,622
Oh, relax. Relax.

407
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,542
I'm not gonna write about
your Free Speech Campaign Act.

408
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,544
No? What you gonna write about?

409
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,755
Your Fuck Small Contributions
Act.

410
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,550
Listen,
I'd love to flirt all night,

411
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,927
but my husband's a jealous man.

412
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,846
I just came by to say,
I look forward

413
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,473
to Sunday's column.

414
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,850
A good shellacking
from Nicholas Booker

415
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,687
is the best endorsement
a candidate could ask for.

416
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,857
If you need help clarifying
the fine print on the bill,

417
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,858
door's always open.

418
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,319
I'll call your aide tomorrow.

419
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,528
I wasn't talking to you.

420
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,323
Call anytime.

421
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,867
Don't be shy.

422
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,537
Rule number two,

423
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,581
Congressmen think
they're presidents,

424
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,875
senators think they're kings,

425
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,919
and presidents think
they're god.

426
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,588
Yeah, well, I'm an atheist.

427
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,630
Hmm.

428
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,008
- You married?
- No.

429
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,969
- Good. Don't.
- Is that a rule or a suggestion?

430
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,514
I'm getting divorced again.

431
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,474
- Fool me twice.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

432
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,392
Oh, no, no.

433
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,685
It's uh...

434
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,728
Congratulations
is more appropriate.

435
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,979
Oh, well.

436
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,027
I think you're the one.

437
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,031
What does that mean exactly?

438
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,743
I need someone in my corner
on these next few columns.

439
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,495
Gonna be short on time

440
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,540
with the old lady trying
to nail me to the cross.

441
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,292
Plus, my TV schedule
is wall to wall

442
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,628
with the general heating up.

443
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,299
You be my Angelo Dundee now,

444
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,594
and I'll be your Don King
when I get my life back.

445
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,971
You... you want me to

446
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,306
I want you to help me
with my columns.

447
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,359
I'll... I'll tell you
what I wanna cover.

448
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,107
You assist with research,
uh, share your notes.

449
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,359
Proof my drafts.

450
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,944
Why me?

451
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,612
Don't fish. It's unseemly.

452
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:20,989
No, I just...

453
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,717
Look. You stood
up to Gordon yesterday

454
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,118
when most guys
who'd been there two decades

455
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,037
sat with pricks in their hand.

456
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,498
And your writing,
it's got punch.

457
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,335
It's raw,
but there's something there.

458
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,756
Wow.

459
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,925
In the interest
of full disclosure,

460
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,636
I was fired from the Globe.

461
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,931
You wanted that
felon's sob story to be true,

462
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:47,992
because you had something
to say about

463
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,893
the criminal justice system.

464
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,979
You let ambition and bias
blind you to the fact

465
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,648
that that fuckwit had something
to gain by bullshitting you.

466
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,987
Moral of the story,
always follow the facts,

467
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,781
wherever they lead.

468
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,574
Sometimes,
it's not where you wanna go.

469
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,409
But you go anyway.

470
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,703
Is that rule number four?

471
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,955
No, that's not a rule.

472
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,041
That's a commandment.

473
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,836
Besides, that felon
had three strikes to his name.

474
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,171
Why shouldn't you?

475
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,675
Mistakes
used to make you better.

476
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,594
Now, you're not allowed
to be human.

477
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,388
Well, fuck that!

478
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,141
You learned your lesson,
and I'm buying the dip.

479
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,601
What do you say?

480
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,563
Yeah.

481
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,690
Wonderful.

482
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:37,731
Now,

483
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,777
I'll need your notes
on Sunday's column

484
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,404
by noon tomorrow.

485
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,155
What's our angle?

486
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,699
Reporters
use their eyes and ears,

487
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,742
columnists use their brains.

488
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,995
We'll know what my angle
is by noon tomorrow, won't we?

489
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,625
Yeah.

490
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,347
Well, if you think Archer

491
00:22:58,753 --> 00:22:59,462
has a grasp on foreign policy,
then tell me why he refuses

492
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,631
to stand up to China.

493
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,884
I mean, we've got ten times
the military spending of Russia,

494
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,095
and yet he cowers in the face
of the Kremlin.

495
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,514
Look,
he's just a weak president.

496
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,516
I'm just gonna... I won't say it.

497
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,602
Republicans know it,
our allies, and we all know it.

498
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,437
And let's be honest,
the Democrats know it, too.

499
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,606
What are you so giddy about?

500
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,001
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Oh!

501
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,113
How'd it go?

502
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,141
- No.
- Oh, yeah. It's coming down.

503
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,125
Get outta here.
It's coming down.

504
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,001
No.

505
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,712
Go away.

506
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,106
- I got you something.
- Oh, yeah?

507
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,508
It's probably worth $44 million.

508
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,593
My own private island,

509
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,928
so I can have some peace
and quiet?

510
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,599
Aw! Where's yours?
You didn't get one for yourself?

511
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,935
I already won the lottery,
because I have you.

512
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,164
How come you're never this
sweet to me when you're sober?

513
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,940
Koalas are sweet.

514
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,567
I am a lion.

515
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,277
- Oh, is that right?
- A lion.

516
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,029
- Oh?
- A hungry lion.

517
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,239
Oh.

518
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,532
Very hungry.

519
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,700
Oh.

520
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,535
Very hungry.

521
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,837
Breaking
news out of the Washington Chronicle.

522
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,756
Olympic gold medalist
and best-selling author,

523
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,954
Nate Sterling is set to launch
an independent campaign

524
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,606
for president next Sunday
in his hometown

525
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,048
of Portsmouth, Ohio.

526
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,008
The reporting
out of the Washington Chronicle

527
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,803
claims that Sterling has hired
the highly sought-after

528
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,681
Kathy Gibbs
as his campaign manager.

529
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,684
While history tells us
that an independent bid faces...

530
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,060
The Chronicle?

531
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:39,896
Oh, Eli, what the fuck?

532
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,940
Come on. Everybody knew he was
running.

533
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,250
It was like the worst-kept
secret.

534
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,902
Kathy Gibbs. Nobody knew about
Kathy Gibbs. Eli.

535
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,529
I have other sources.

536
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,031
I wouldn't have pitched it
if I hadn't double-checked...

537
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,075
Am I your source
or am I your boyfriend?

538
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,993
You never said
it was off the record.

539
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,120
You can't be serious.

540
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,913
Sorry, Lucas. I really am.

541
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:00,083
I just... it just came out.
I... I didn't even plan on it.

542
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,169
And then it was out. I just...

543
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,755
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

544
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,758
Fuck, fuck. Who are you calling?

545
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:10,927
Eli.

546
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,303
Senator Turnbull, please.

547
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,972
What?

548
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,975
Eli James
from the Washington Chronicle.

549
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,645
Senator Turnbull.
I'm sorry to call you so late.

550
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,814
I was just wondering
if you had any thoughts

551
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,692
on Nate Sterling
entering the race.

552
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,028
Right now?

553
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,781
Uh, yeah. Of course.

554
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,033
I'll be right there.

555
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,702
Eli. What the fuck?

556
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:41,166
I just got an interview
with Patricia Turnbull.

557
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,876
Now?

558
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,794
Are you serious? You're drunk!

559
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:47,672
Buzzed. And I wouldn't have
this interview

560
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,050
if it wasn't for you,
so thank you so much.

561
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:50,967
I love you.

562
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,385
Wait.

563
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,220
- Cold shower now.
- I don't have time.

564
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,182
No, now! Give me the keys.

565
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,643
Do not go easy on her, okay?

566
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,771
Okay.

567
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:05,815
Here.

568
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:08,902
- Listen to me.
- Yes.

569
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,153
Anything you have seen,

570
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,780
heard, or read
under this roof...

571
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,424
- Mm-hmm.
- Is of the fucking record...

572
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:16,201
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay? Especially in Turn bull's office.

573
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,827
- Yeah.
- Eli!

574
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:18,953
Scout's honor.

575
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,080
Yeah. Scout's...

576
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,752
Just global response.
No, we don't go for that.

577
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,712
Eli James for Senator Turnbull.

578
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,339
Please sign in.

579
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,924
She's expecting you.

580
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,175
Come on in, hon!

581
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:34,718
Where is...

582
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:37,847
Evening, Senator.

583
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,099
Good evening!

584
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,768
I noticed a Tom Mayfield
on your sign-in log.

585
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,354
Is that the same Mayfield
from Super Millions?

586
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,397
You know Tom?

587
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,023
I'm writing a story on lotto.

588
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,066
Oh, dear.

589
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,110
That sounds like a real
tour de force.

590
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,820
How do you know Mr. Mayfield?

591
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,341
You see the one in the bow tie?

592
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,283
Oh, my God. Is that you? Wow.

593
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,827
He thinks because we dated

594
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,995
30 years ago,
he can drop by unannounced

595
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,123
with all kinds of suggestions.

596
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,959
I love this town.

597
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,378
It'll even turn ex-boyfriends
into lobbyists.

598
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,921
Hmm.

599
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,194
What is your reaction
to Nate Sterling

600
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,344
entering the race?

601
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,139
I look forward to a healthy,

602
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,018
robust debate on the future
of our great nation.

603
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,770
I'm not too familiar
with Mr. Sterling personally,

604
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,314
but anyone who aspires
to serve his or her country,

605
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:31,860
whether it's an Olympian,
or a lieutenant, or a president,

606
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:35,030
it is okay by me.
Off the record?

607
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:39,451
Mr. Sterling is swimming
with sharks,

608
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,161
and he can't afford a cage.

609
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,501
How would you describe

610
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,171
your relationship
with Harvey Altman?

611
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:54,174
Harvey was my senior advisor
for many years.

612
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,467
Isn't it odd

613
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,386
that your most trusted advisor
splits to found.

614
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,764
Up Right Super PAC
just a few weeks

615
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,223
before you announce
your candidacy?

616
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,183
What's odd about it?

617
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,226
Well, Up Right is raking in

618
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,771
loads of cash
from high-dollar donors.

619
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:08,938
As is their legal right.

620
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,190
Thanks to your bill.

621
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,150
My bill gives Americans

622
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,069
the freedom to do
what they please

623
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,254
with their hard-earned money.

624
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,197
You seem very fond of that word.
"Freedom."

625
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,239
Oh, yes, I am.

626
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,217
It's what this country
was built on.

627
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,785
For some.

628
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:22,827
Hmm.

629
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,529
There are reports that Upright

630
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,167
has raised upwards of
$80 million in just four months.

631
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,960
- And?
- Won't that give the rich

632
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,755
an outsized influence
in a Turnbull administration?

633
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:37,008
Oh, hon. You talk about the rich
as if they're inhuman.

634
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,010
I started my company
40 years ago

635
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,806
with one truck
and a whole lot of elbow grease.

636
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,475
Surely, the American dream
don't make me a bad person.

637
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:48,436
I see that same fire
in your eyes right now.

638
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,480
You didn't answer my question,
Senator.

639
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,483
Listen, Eli.

640
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,572
Five million from a fat wallet
and a searing column

641
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:02,826
from Nicholas Booker
are one in the same.

642
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,203
Both might get me off
on a good day.

643
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,206
But if you think they so much
as sway my stance

644
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:11,126
on the renaming of a post office

645
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,294
in Was ill a, Alaska,

646
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,213
then you haven't done
your homework.

647
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,426
Why did you invite me
here tonight?

648
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,886
Oh, honey. Relax.

649
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,972
This ain't the principal's
office.

650
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:25,533
You're here,
because if there's one thing

651
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,892
I've learned over two decades
in these chambers,

652
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,103
it's to keep your friends close.

653
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,273
And seeing as you'll be helping
with the most widely-read

654
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,484
op-ed column in this country,
I figured we might get to know

655
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,819
one another.

656
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,075
Nick is a cheapskate.
I tip Enrique way better.

657
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,335
Mm-hmm.

658
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,003
Nick, can I ask you something?

659
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,257
There's something gnawing at me
with this whole lotto.

660
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:42,634
What about my column?

661
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,387
Wrote up my notes last night.

662
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,014
You were drunk last night.

663
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,140
Just hear me out.

664
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,435
Lotto jackpots increase
during recessions.

665
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:56,272
They have for every economic
downturn as far back

666
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:57,357
as the data goes.

667
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,525
And why should I care?

668
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,027
Because not this time.

669
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,446
Since the recession hit,
Super Millions' jackpots

670
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,657
have fallen
close to five percent.

671
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,992
- Tragic.
- It's a complete 180.

672
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,578
A behavioral impossibility.

673
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,039
Human nature
doesn't just reverse itself.

674
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,458
And Super Millions
is the only lottery

675
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,960
that's had that kind
of inversion.

676
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,563
Wherever you're going
with this, get there faster.

677
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,214
Public schools that rely

678
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,216
on that money
are getting stiffed.

679
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,719
So, where is the missing money
going?

680
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,554
This better be good.

681
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:32,017
The director of Super Millions
is a guy named Tom Mayfield.

682
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:36,271
Duke alum. Class of '82.
Senator Turn bull's Alma mater.

683
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,564
They dated in college.

684
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,027
I hope you're not suggesting
what I think you're suggesting.

685
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,212
The same accounting firm,

686
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,697
Meyers & Goldstein,
handles the books

687
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,700
for both Super Millions
and Up Right.

688
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:53,496
You think that
Mayfield and Turnbull

689
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,582
are embezzling funds
from the lottery,

690
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,710
and smuggling
into her largest Super PAC?

691
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,628
At the expense of our nation's
public schools.

692
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:07,052
Everything's a fucking
conspiracy.

693
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,387
UpRight's books are sealed shut.

694
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,240
Thanks to Turn bull's bill,
they don't have to report

695
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,390
where the money comes from.

696
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,161
It could all be happening
under the same roof,

697
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,865
- behind closed doors.
- Don't be that guy.

698
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,664
- What guy?
- The bug-eyed virtual vigilante,

699
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,108
running a bullshit blog
and a libelous YouTube channel

700
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,610
out of her parents' basement.

701
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,780
Okay. Tom Mayfield was
in Turn bull's office last night.

702
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,406
I saw his name on the log-in.

703
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,759
- Maybe they're still fucking.
- Nick.

704
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:30,992
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

705
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,703
- Um, reigniting the spark.
- I'm serious.

706
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,581
Turn bull's a bully
and a misguided idea log.

707
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:37,623
She's not a crook.

708
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:42,671
All I'm asking you to do
is to, you know,

709
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,631
go into that legendary rolodex
of yours,

710
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,508
and make one or two calls.

711
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,486
See if there's a relationship
between the top brass

712
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,471
at Meyers & Goldstein
and anyone in Turn bull's camp.

713
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:55,016
If there's nothing there,
I will drop it. I promise.

714
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,397
How the fuck did this leak?

715
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:01,189
All right. It's done.

716
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,357
Let's move forward.

717
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,650
This might actually help us?

718
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,026
How's that?

719
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:09,656
A full week for the word
to spread means more people.

720
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,825
A ton more people.

721
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,576
Bigger crowd means
more media attention,

722
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,704
which might bring us
an air of legitimacy

723
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:16,745
from the jump.

724
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,168
I drafted a statement
last night.

725
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,254
Get it out ASAP and get to work

726
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:28,216
on as many appearances
as you possibly can.

727
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:31,720
Uh, local morning shows,
county fairs. You name it.

728
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:35,181
We play this right,
soon, it'll be Late Night.

729
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:39,269
And if we're lucky,
SNL will come calling.

730
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,812
Got it?

731
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,439
Good. Let's get to work.

732
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,566
Oh. And, Lucas, pack your bags.

733
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,693
What?

734
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:47,902
You're gonna be living

735
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,738
on the campaign bus
for the next few months.

736
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,157
I hope you like
cornfields and Big Macs.

737
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,785
Who doesn't?

738
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:56,827
Lucas.

739
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,542
You know that I know, right?

740
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:03,668
Nate, I am so sorry.

741
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,211
That's all right.

742
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,413
Wouldn't be here without you.

743
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,816
And if I can't roll
with the punches,

744
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,280
I shouldn't be running
for president.

745
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,304
But we're building
something here.

746
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,626
Something bigger than ourselves.

747
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,476
So, from here on out,
let's just keep things

748
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,353
close to the chest, okay?

749
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:22,437
Even in your own house.

750
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,443
Pretend you're in the CIA.
See you on the campaign bus.

751
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,381
You double-checked
the lotto stats?

752
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,799
Triple-checked.

753
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Let's go.

754
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:59,516
The CEO of Meyers & Goldstein
hosted two private fundraisers

755
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,601
for Turnbull
at his country house

756
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:02,644
during the primaries.

757
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,437
It's probably
just a coincidence.

758
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,774
But fishy enough for us
to follow the scent.

759
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,610
Well, there's still something
I can't wrap my head around.

760
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,570
If they really are cooking
the books,

761
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,531
why are they willing to risk
years behind bars?

762
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,950
Government shells out
500 billion a year

763
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,952
in contracts
to the private sector.

764
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,620
Meyers & Goldstein's
bread and butter.

765
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,789
Right. So, what now?

766
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,207
Well, we get someone

767
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:27,961
on the inside to help us
find proof and blow the whistle.

768
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,921
How do we do that?

769
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,589
That's a good question.

770
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:35,301
I've got a neighbor
who pushes paper

771
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:36,594
for Meyers & Goldstein.

772
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,723
Got his kid into kindergarten.

773
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,601
Fuck, I love this town.

774
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,940
I help this poor guy piss away
30K in glorified daycare,

775
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,900
and he owes me a favor.

776
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:52,318
So, you'll get him
to fish around?

777
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,653
No, no, no, no.

778
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:54,696
He wouldn't do that.

779
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,616
He thinks that Turnbull
is Reagan in pearls.

780
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,327
No.

781
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:04,581
But I have got you an interview
with his associate in PR.

782
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:08,585
So, go! Go.
Recruit us a double agent.

783
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,337
Ooh. Where are you going?

784
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,505
I've got my own interview.

785
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:13,673
With who?

786
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:16,301
At worst,
your generation's Ralph Nader.

787
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,511
At best,
the second coming of Christ.

788
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:22,390
Although something tells me,
he's somewhere in between.

789
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:54,297
We're a perennial benefactor

790
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,716
of the Boys and Girls Club
of DC, and this year,

791
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,635
we've implemented
a company-wide day of service

792
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:00,053
with Habitat for Humanity.

793
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,596
Wow.

794
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:04,724
It must be so rewarding,
giving inner-city kids

795
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:05,725
safe places to grow.

796
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,268
Hmm. It really is.

797
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,019
Is that your little one?

798
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:11,606
Mm!

799
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:12,732
That's my Maya.

800
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,984
She is really beautiful.

801
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,027
Isn't she?

802
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,737
Look at those cheeks!

803
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,447
You're so sweet.
Do you have kids?

804
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,490
Maybe one day.

805
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,951
But for now, this is my baby.

806
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,704
So, Ms. Cooke...

807
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,497
Oh, please call me, "Jennifer".

808
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,291
Jennifer.

809
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,752
How do your company's
charitable donations compare

810
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,629
to its political donations?

811
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:38,383
I knew you'd throw
a hard ball sooner or later.

812
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,761
But I'm not privy
to that information.

813
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:43,656
If you'd like to chat
about our sustainability...

814
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,891
What is your opinion
on Senator Patricia Turnbull?

815
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,435
You mean personally?

816
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:50,311
I, uh...

817
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:51,622
- What does this have to do...
- Some people think

818
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,314
she would set the country
back 50 years.

819
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,877
Listen. Between you and me,
I think she'd set

820
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,903
the country back 100 years.

821
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,364
But I don't understand
why you wanna talk to me...

822
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,449
Meyers & Goldstein

823
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,576
handles the books
for Super Millions

824
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:08,580
and for Turn bull's Super PAC,
Up Right.

825
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:09,622
Isn't that correct?

826
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,917
I'm sorry. I can't discuss...

827
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,128
Who handles those accounts?

828
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,481
- I'm not authorized...
- Does the same executive cover both?

829
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:18,858
Okay. I think
I'm gonna have to ask you

830
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,383
- to leave...
- Please. Jennifer.

831
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,610
If you don't tell me
what this is about...

832
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,136
I, too, think Patricia Turnbull

833
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:26,473
is on the wrong side of
history, and potentially, the law.

834
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:29,684
I think
you're gonna wanna see this.

835
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,985
Planning for a comeback?

836
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,029
Running for president

837
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:43,448
is more grueling than decathlon.

838
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,912
I'm surprised
you didn't cancel our interview.

839
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,848
Why? 'Cause your team
did a better job than mine?

840
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:52,082
Hmm.

841
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,478
My day maybe a bit more hectic
thanks to the Chronicle,

842
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:57,420
but I always keep
my commitments.

843
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:58,462
All right.

844
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,548
First question.

845
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:03,551
Why?

846
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:04,844
Why?

847
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,030
Yeah. I mean,
you could earn millions,

848
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,931
slapping your face
on that protein shake,

849
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,849
and spending your time
golfing and fishing.

850
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:11,184
You know, not a bad life.

851
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,520
So, again, I ask you, why?

852
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,106
Because I suck at golf.

853
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:19,226
We've seen what happens

854
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,259
when a narcissist
with no experience

855
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,655
turns delusions of grandeur
into reality.

856
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:26,533
So, you tell me
why this isn't anything

857
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:27,784
more than a vanity run?

858
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,536
Look, I think it's only fair

859
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:30,846
you give me an honest
evaluation before you diagnose me,

860
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,414
Mr. Booker.

861
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:33,683
I'm not just coming
from the locker room

862
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,041
to the debate stage.

863
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,083
I went to Yale.

864
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:37,706
Oh, yeah. Law school.

865
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:39,855
And your foundation's done
a lot of good,

866
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:40,982
but you're up against
two candidates

867
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,882
with damn near
a century's experience

868
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:43,925
between them.

869
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,038
How's that worked out for us,
huh?

870
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,447
You checked your
retirement portfolio lately?

871
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:49,699
Have you been
to any of these towns

872
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:51,891
destroyed by flash floods
or forest fires?

873
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:54,728
You checked the numbers
on drug overdoses or suicides?

874
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,980
Shit! Life expectancy's gone
down for the first time

875
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,022
in decades.

876
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,610
People are desperate out there.

877
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:03,963
They want somebody
to do something about it.

878
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,697
Somebody to invest
in our future,

879
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:08,116
not for the next four years,
but for the next 40 years.

880
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,664
What, do I have something
in my teeth?

881
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,249
No.

882
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,644
I'm just trying to figure out if
you're for real or full of shit.

883
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:19,708
That is for you to decide.

884
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,255
I assure you,
my work was very real

885
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,466
to tens of thousands
of grieving families.

886
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,676
Well, you surely made
some very powerful enemies.

887
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,470
Who? Big drug companies?

888
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:29,971
They were selling
bold-faced lies.

889
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:32,932
Claiming oxy wasn't addictive.
Let me ask you a question.

890
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,994
How much do you think the NRA
spend on lobbying every year?

891
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,102
Two, three million?

892
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:37,312
Correct.

893
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,114
What do you think big pharma
spent last year?

894
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:42,233
300 million.

895
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,611
They say they got nothing to hide?

896
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,530
And that's why my heart medicine
costs more than my alimony.

897
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,216
We're gonna
do something about that, too.

898
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,241
Oh, my ex-wife?

899
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,159
Please, please do.

900
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,125
Look me in the eye.

901
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,919
And tell me why you think
you can win.

902
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,631
'Cause I'll tell you
what Vegas thinks.

903
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,801
You don't stand a chance.
Then what?

904
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,053
You peel off enough votes
from the president

905
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:13,515
to hand Turnbull the election
on a silver platter.

906
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:15,934
I don't play for silver.

907
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:21,731
If you are able

908
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,817
to get me any information
at all,

909
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:26,111
emails, financials,
expense reports, don't...

910
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:28,571
Okay, listen. I'm gonna stop you
right there.

911
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:29,757
There has to be another way
for you

912
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,699
to get the information you need.

913
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,991
And what if I can't?

914
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,284
Then what?

915
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:35,245
Do we just let them get away
with it?

916
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:36,996
Your bosses could be committing
a crime

917
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:38,998
that has devastating
ripple effects,

918
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,085
and it would be a crime
with no consequence,

919
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,045
no punishment,
no accountability.

920
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,358
But that's just the way
the world works I guess. Right?

921
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,925
Nothing we can do about it.

922
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,177
Pardon me, but fuck that.

923
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:52,721
This time, we can.

924
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:56,599
I'm sorry.

925
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:57,961
I have my daughter
to think about.

926
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:03,647
Of course.

927
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,997
I hear there's a real bad cold
going around.

928
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,082
If you have to cough,
it's okay. I'll understand.

929
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,839
Robert Friedman, Rebecca Carter

930
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:32,677
Ben Florence, Amy Parker

931
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:35,221
Spencer Erickson.

932
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,017
You need to leave.

933
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,022
Please. Don't contact me again.

934
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,068
Thank you.

935
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,570
I spoke with Tom this morning.

936
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,096
That's right.

937
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:18,264
Okay, I'll talk to Dean,
and have him CC you

938
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:20,809
on the latest approval,
so we're all on the same page.

939
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,267
You're kidding me.

940
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:05,805
Yeah. Gordon didn't have
the decency to do it himself.

941
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,856
Son of a bitch.

942
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:14,320
You cut our three best

943
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:16,156
investigative reporters
and leave

944
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:18,408
the whole damn sports page
intact?

945
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,701
Relax, Nick.

946
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,013
Nothing I can do.
This came down from above.

947
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,872
Oh, yeah.
Like the Ten Commandments.

948
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:25,725
And you sure as fuck
didn't follow any of those.

949
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:27,167
Look, we're bleeding cash.

950
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,002
And the investigative team
is among

951
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,712
the highest-salaried employees.

952
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,006
First, they came
for the journalists.

953
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,483
We don't know what happened
after that.

954
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:36,009
Don't be so goddamn dramatic.

955
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:38,470
Well, you're the one
who dropped the fucking curtain!

956
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:41,014
Soon, we'll be no better
than the National Enquirer.

957
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:42,432
I told you,

958
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,534
we're gonna have to get down
in the mud with the pigs.

959
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:45,143
Times have changed.

960
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:46,227
Oh, yeah?

961
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:47,771
What do you suggest
we do about it?

962
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:49,081
I suggest you keep
your head down,

963
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:50,523
and let me worry about it.

964
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:52,067
This is so weak, Gordon.

965
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,046
I always knew you were a prick,

966
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,863
but I never thought
you were a pushover.

967
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,449
We need to hold
our best reporters tight.

968
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,911
If there's no one to defend
the truth,

969
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:05,205
then we live
in a fact-free world.

970
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:07,082
And that's a scary
fucking place to live.

971
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:10,085
What's your column
about this week?

972
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:15,048
You've never asked that before.

973
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,884
Mr. Hampton would strongly

974
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:20,095
prefer you stay out
of the New York senate race.

975
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:21,388
Oh, well, then you can tell

976
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:24,015
Mr. Hampton
that I strongly prefer

977
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,475
he go fuck himself.

978
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,310
Yeah.

979
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,239
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right?

980
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:46,973
I wish you'd gotten
that promotion.

981
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:48,475
Please get it done, okay?
Thank you.

982
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,538
Hey, hon.

983
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,624
I'm at the office late tonight.

984
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,170
Okay. Okay. I'll pick him up.

985
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,964
But I'm gonna drop him home
and head right back in.

986
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:23,093
Yeah, it's killing me.

987
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:24,528
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

988
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:39,043
Senator Patricia Turnbull

989
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:41,361
has altered
her campaign schedule,

990
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,905
adding a stop in Ohio
next Sunday in what appears...

991
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:44,947
Yeah.

992
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,490
There's your haystack.

993
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:52,914
Holy shit!

994
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:55,416
Who's your source?

995
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,420
That's confidential.

996
00:47:58,461 --> 00:48:00,255
Is it the PR associate?

997
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,174
I got you the damn interview.

998
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:06,177
What's your angle?

999
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:07,012
You want top byline?

1000
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:08,930
No. I just... I don't think...

1001
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:11,433
Who is the goddamn
whistleblower?

1002
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:17,230
You stole it?

1003
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:18,272
It's everything we need.

1004
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:26,698
They don't give Pulitzers
to fucking shoplifters.

1005
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,491
I hit a dead-end.

1006
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:30,243
And so, I made a judgment call.

1007
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,245
Something this big,
the ends justify the means.

1008
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,123
The ends? For who?

1009
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,959
- For you!
- No! The American people!

1010
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,419
Bullshit!

1011
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:41,087
I should have you fired.

1012
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:42,606
You're the one
who should be fired.

1013
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,191
You are phoning it in
right in the middle

1014
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:45,359
of one of the most crucial
elections

1015
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:47,052
of both of our lifetimes.

1016
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:48,279
Where is the integrity in that?

1017
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:50,096
Have fun
back at the kids' table,

1018
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,724
scooping up
Kevin Conrad's scraps!

1019
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,769
Please! Somewhere in that pile
is the story of a lifetime.

1020
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,729
I have no desire to commit

1021
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,440
career suicide just before
the Lifetime Achievements

1022
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:02,400
start rolling in
on the back of my pension.

1023
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:05,987
Literal suicide
is a different question.

1024
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:09,449
But you're not my therapist.
Now, get out of my office!

1025
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:10,784
We're done!

1026
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,531
Senator Turnbull leads

1027
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,338
all candidates
in total campaign spend,

1028
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:48,839
having raised more cash
than both Sterling and Archer

1029
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:50,073
for the third month in a row.

1030
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:52,593
In a surprise to many,

1031
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,537
Nate Sterling has gained steam
heading into July.

1032
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:57,431
He now sits just six points
back from President Archer

1033
00:49:57,455 --> 00:49:59,332
and eight points back from.

1034
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,603
Eli,
something special is happening here.

1035
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:02,669
The stump speeches
are starting to feel

1036
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:04,671
like rock concerts.

1037
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:06,381
I wish you were here to see it.

1038
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:11,362
Some school districts
are moving to a four-day school week.

1039
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:12,846
School boards
and superintendents

1040
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:15,348
across the nation blame
the recession,

1041
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,601
which has caused local tax
revenues to fall off the cliff.

1042
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:21,396
Teachers have have taken
to GoFundMe campaigns

1043
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,399
just to acquire the bare minimum
of school supplies.

1044
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:28,838
So the truth is I
just didn't think it was worth it.

1045
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,155
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1046
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,617
- Take it easy.
- Take care.

1047
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:36,578
I'm headed to dinner
with Harvey Altman.

1048
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:38,704
How do I look?

1049
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:41,374
Like a man in a tie.

1050
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:45,730
It wouldn't hurt to give a guy
a compliment once in a while.

1051
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,505
Uh, about this email

1052
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:49,591
encouraging us to donate
to Up Right Super PAC...

1053
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:51,718
Yeah.
I already gave 'em five grand.

1054
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,803
I don't exactly feel
comfortable.

1055
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:55,680
Don't be cheap.
Just throw 'em a few bucks.

1056
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,432
Keep the boss happy.

1057
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,474
And if I don't?

1058
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:02,395
You never talked back
when you were my assistant.

1059
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:03,521
I kinda like it.

1060
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,671
Oh, God.

1061
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:57,344
Hello?

1062
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:03,892
How long have you known?

1063
00:53:05,935 --> 00:53:07,479
Six months.

1064
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,356
Why didn't you tell me?

1065
00:53:09,397 --> 00:53:11,524
You had enough to worry about.

1066
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:14,819
And Penny
was going back overseas.

1067
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:16,321
How bad is it?

1068
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,781
That's why I called.

1069
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:21,576
I met with the oncologist
this morning, and

1070
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,870
well...

1071
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:31,586
Go ahead, Eli.

1072
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:33,630
You can say it.

1073
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,840
I mean,
I should've quit years ago.

1074
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,888
We'll find the best doctors.
We... we

1075
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,723
I'm on top of it.

1076
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:44,974
You don't need to worry.

1077
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:46,518
Don't worry?

1078
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,353
- Dad, we need to act fast...
- Elisha.

1079
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:50,689
I said I'm handling it.

1080
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:59,322
You need to focus on your work.

1081
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:03,326
You know, I was thinking
why don't you pitch.

1082
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:05,954
- Nicholas Booker about a column?
- Dad! Dad! Mom!

1083
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:11,418
Look. I've been talking
about cancer all day.

1084
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:13,420
- Hal.
- I'm sick of it.

1085
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:32,439
Nick and I are working
on something really big, dad.

1086
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:35,775
That's good.

1087
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:36,776
Yeah.

1088
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:49,983
Hey, babe.

1089
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:52,517
My plane's about to take off.
What's up?

1090
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:55,670
Eli, can... can you hear me?

1091
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,287
Oh, shit.

1092
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:03,970
Eli? Is everything all right?

1093
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,012
It's my dad.

1094
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:08,350
He's sick.

1095
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:10,643
Sick? How sick?

1096
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,633
Sir.

1097
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,426
Oh, shit.

1098
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:15,148
Listen. I'm gonna catch
the first flight back, okay?

1099
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:16,815
No! No, no, no, no.

1100
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:19,736
We're taking care of it.
You're where you need to be.

1101
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:22,189
Okay.

1102
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:24,114
I love you.

1103
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,118
I love you, too, babe.

1104
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,097
Eli, I'm gonna lose you until we land.

1105
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:30,163
I'm calling you back
as soon as I can.

1106
00:55:58,149 --> 00:55:59,776
Who's your source?

1107
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:01,444
Jennifer Cooke in PR.

1108
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:04,406
Let's get to work.

1109
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:15,851
As summer fades
to fall, the race has never been tighter.

1110
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,835
I mean, the man's trying

1111
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:20,136
to do something
that's never been done before.

1112
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:22,108
And I'm just not convinced
that he can pull it off.

1113
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:23,359
Whoa! Hold on.

1114
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:24,863
He sold out the big house
in Michigan.

1115
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:28,138
That's a 110,000
for a political rally.

1116
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:29,889
I've never seen anything
like it.

1117
00:56:29,931 --> 00:56:31,617
Okay. I mean, it is impressive.

1118
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:33,160
But it's not like
Senator Turn bull's just

1119
00:56:33,184 --> 00:56:34,184
gonna roll over.

1120
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:36,466
She's had the lead
since day one.

1121
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:38,666
Who do you plan to vote for?

1122
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,050
Nate Sterling.

1123
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:42,878
Do you
usually vote Democrat or Republican?

1124
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:44,005
I've never voted before.

1125
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:44,070
And this is my first time
voting.

1126
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:21,983
Nick.

1127
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:23,025
Huh?

1128
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:25,232
Does it make any sense

1129
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:27,182
for the director
of Super Millions

1130
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:29,550
to send an expense report
for a holiday party

1131
00:57:29,574 --> 00:57:32,535
to a partner
at Meyers & Goldstein?

1132
00:57:32,577 --> 00:57:34,537
No.

1133
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:37,499
An assistant would perform
those menial tasks. Why?

1134
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,685
I think these invoices
are fakes.

1135
00:57:58,728 --> 00:58:01,231
They each contain
a four, an eight, or both.

1136
00:58:01,272 --> 00:58:02,272
That's the tell.

1137
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:03,983
Well, it's human nature

1138
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:05,985
to prefer some numbers
over others.

1139
00:58:06,027 --> 00:58:08,697
This is how companies spot
expense-account fraud.

1140
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:11,741
I mean, I'm willing to bet
that the Memorial Day retreat

1141
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:12,701
didn't even happen.

1142
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:13,886
Well, any real invoices

1143
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,161
from Patriot Catering

1144
00:58:15,203 --> 00:58:17,789
sure didn't pass
through these execs.

1145
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:25,213
174684.

1146
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:44,858
The average Super Millions
jackpot is $20 million.

1147
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:48,028
In recessions, jackpots
increase by approximately

1148
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:49,863
eight percent.

1149
00:58:49,904 --> 00:58:52,073
So, that means
that the average jackpot

1150
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:54,117
- should be...
- 21.6 million.

1151
00:58:55,368 --> 00:58:58,163
Correct. 21.6 million.

1152
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:02,709
But it's holding steady
at 19 million.

1153
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,712
Well, that's a gap
of 2.6 million per drawing.

1154
00:59:09,674 --> 00:59:12,093
Right. The first
Patriot trading invoice

1155
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:16,056
goes back to 34 weeks ago.

1156
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,392
Two drawings a week. That's...

1157
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:20,434
That is...

1158
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,355
God.

1159
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:30,362
- Pretty damn close to bulls-eye.
- Holy fuck.

1160
00:59:31,696 --> 00:59:34,949
For every $1,000 embezzled

1161
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:36,231
from the Super Millions lottery

1162
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:38,387
and transferred to Up Right,
the invoice...

1163
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:40,038
Show a buck.

1164
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,955
Yeah.

1165
00:59:40,997 --> 00:59:42,916
That's their fucking code.

1166
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,419
Erickson.

1167
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:49,756
Erickson fudges the books, okay?

1168
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:52,717
The money moves
in the dark of night.

1169
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:56,971
The... the... the... the invoices
track the spoils,

1170
00:59:57,013 --> 01:00:00,266
letting them communicate
without having to type fraud

1171
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:01,685
in the subject line.

1172
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:04,229
A barn full of haystacks.

1173
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,358
And you found
the fucking needle.

1174
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:11,152
Thank you.

1175
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:26,292
Hey, can I bum a cigarette?

1176
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:27,334
Oh, yeah.

1177
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,297
Thanks.

1178
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:33,091
Oh, so, you're the caterer.

1179
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:34,819
- Yeah.
- Excellent job inside.

1180
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:36,720
Those deviled eggs
look delicious.

1181
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:37,846
Thanks.

1182
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:39,907
I wish I could tell you
that I made them,

1183
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:41,033
but I just load 'em in
and hand 'em out.

1184
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:44,728
"Patriot Catering."

1185
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:46,872
- That's us.
- Haven't seen you guys before.

1186
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:47,957
Have you been in business
for a long time?

1187
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:50,150
Uh, coming up to a year.

1188
01:00:50,191 --> 01:00:52,193
- Wow. Really new.
- Mm-hmm.

1189
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:53,987
- Family-owned?
- Nope.

1190
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,905
This dude named Dean owns it.

1191
01:00:55,947 --> 01:00:57,991
Wait. Not Dean Bender.

1192
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,744
No. Dean Clifton.

1193
01:01:00,785 --> 01:01:03,079
Oh, gotcha. Clifton.

1194
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,247
Yeah.

1195
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,082
So, you got a lot of events
coming up?

1196
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,752
Rubbing elbows with D.C. big wigs?

1197
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:10,513
We got some big ones coming up.

1198
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:12,982
But honestly, they're, like,
all the same to me, you know?

1199
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:15,884
Same bacon-wrapped scallops.
Same penguin suit.

1200
01:01:15,925 --> 01:01:17,802
Same rich folks
boring up the place.

1201
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:22,098
You got a card?

1202
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,850
Oh, yeah.

1203
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:26,853
Just you know, somewhere here.

1204
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,064
Here.
Uh, the menu's in that link.

1205
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,776
So, if you ever throw a bash,
you know, we're around.

1206
01:01:33,526 --> 01:01:35,070
Cool. Thanks.

1207
01:01:35,111 --> 01:01:36,279
- Yeah.
- And thanks.

1208
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:38,239
- Yeah. Have a good one.
- You, too.

1209
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:43,971
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.

1210
01:01:43,995 --> 01:01:46,122
We need to move on,
and I wanna give

1211
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:49,417
Mr. Sterling a chance to
respond before closing statements.

1212
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,002
Let's face it.

1213
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,879
Washington's got one foot
so far left

1214
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:56,216
and the other so far right,
that it can't stand up straight.

1215
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:58,468
Congress is doing a split
in the quicksand,

1216
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:59,987
and I'm the only guy
that can pull us out

1217
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:01,137
of this partisan quagmire.

1218
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:04,057
Why? Because I'm free.

1219
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,935
Free of special interests.
Free of party-power brokers.

1220
01:02:06,976 --> 01:02:09,396
And I'm free to explore
the best ideas

1221
01:02:09,437 --> 01:02:11,147
from both sides of the aisle.

1222
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:13,024
Because I don't sit
on either one.

1223
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,266
I stand proudly in the middle.

1224
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,238
Credentials to the debate?

1225
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:21,949
Sure.

1226
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:24,953
What's it being
Booker's lapdog, eh?

1227
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:30,059
But what you
don't seem to understand, sir,

1228
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,835
we're talking about decisions

1229
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:34,004
that can mean the difference
between life and death.

1230
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:35,922
- The wisdom...
- Tell me the truth, though.

1231
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:39,175
Has, um...
has the old man lost a step?

1232
01:02:41,052 --> 01:02:42,971
You know, just putting
so much time

1233
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:45,515
into a cub with a rap sheet.

1234
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:49,561
If I were you, I would just
keep asking myself why?

1235
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:53,106
I'm trying to watch the debate.

1236
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:55,275
Take it easy, Patricia.

1237
01:02:55,316 --> 01:02:57,444
Mr. Sterling represented
our country proudly.

1238
01:02:57,485 --> 01:02:58,862
Oh, oh, oh.

1239
01:02:58,903 --> 01:03:00,572
I beg your pardon,
Mr. President.

1240
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:03,074
The only reason you're giving
his lack of experience

1241
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:05,910
a hall pass is because you see
in the polls

1242
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:08,872
that he's gonna steal more
votes from me than he is from you

1243
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:10,874
in key battleground states.

1244
01:03:10,915 --> 01:03:14,836
But this election
is about so much more

1245
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:15,878
than politics.

1246
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:19,299
And I'm not even talking
about what it'll mean

1247
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:23,178
to millions of little girls
to see a woman take

1248
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:25,930
the oath of office
for the very first time

1249
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:27,223
in this country.

1250
01:03:27,265 --> 01:03:30,018
That's significant. Oh!

1251
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,978
Yes, it is.

1252
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,397
But let's leave that discussion
to the history books,

1253
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,024
'cause what I wanna talk
about right now

1254
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,277
is what my administration
is gonna do

1255
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:42,530
to make your lives better.
Plain simple.

1256
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:45,033
Like fixing that pothole
on your street.

1257
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:48,328
Getting your 401K moving up
and to the right again.

1258
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,663
Keeping you
and your children safe

1259
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:52,624
from enemies,
foreign and domestic.

1260
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:55,377
Pulling us out of this
recession once and for all.

1261
01:03:56,503 --> 01:04:00,006
And most importantly,
shining a light

1262
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:03,009
on the working people
of this country

1263
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:05,595
who have been invisible
for far too long.

1264
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,057
That's what
I'm gonna talk about.

1265
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:11,934
Thank you.

1266
01:04:13,144 --> 01:04:14,562
What will it mean

1267
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:17,232
for millions of little girls
to see a female president?

1268
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:20,714
Far more than I could ever
comprehend.

1269
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:24,364
But what's it gonna mean
for our environment,

1270
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:28,284
for our teachers,
for our poor and middle class

1271
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:30,286
to see you as president,
Senator Turnbull?

1272
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:34,332
We are long overdue for a woman
in the White House.

1273
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:36,459
But it can't just be any woman.

1274
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:38,420
It's gotta be the right woman.

1275
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:39,963
Not a woman that denied
climate change

1276
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:41,256
is real till just last year.

1277
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,510
And that is precisely
why my cabinet

1278
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,012
will be made up
of 50 percent women

1279
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:47,971
at the very minimal.

1280
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,022
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

1281
01:04:57,063 --> 01:04:58,958
I can't believe we're actually
in the same state.

1282
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,358
I kinda like it.

1283
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,193
Think you might wanna ditch
your credentials.

1284
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:04,404
You'll scare the personality
out of everyone.

1285
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,197
Hey, Nate.

1286
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:07,466
Awesome job.

1287
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,242
Thank you.
What are the mosquitos sayin'?

1288
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:11,327
Well, most of the pundits
are calling it for you,

1289
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:13,246
and Twitter's looking
pretty bullish.

1290
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:15,081
You remember my girlfriend, Eli.

1291
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:16,499
That I do.

1292
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:20,021
I hear you're making big waves
over at the Chronicle.

1293
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:23,340
Splashing about
in the shallow end,

1294
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:25,050
but I'm trying.

1295
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:26,411
I'm sure you had to disclose

1296
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:27,385
that you're dating
this handsome guy.

1297
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:28,720
I did.

1298
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:30,682
But it helps that I'm not
covering your campaign.

1299
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:32,932
Of course.

1300
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:34,254
What did you think
of the debate?

1301
01:05:35,143 --> 01:05:36,144
Honestly?

1302
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,789
I'd be surprised
if you didn't poach

1303
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:40,398
a point or two
from both parties.

1304
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,419
- She's a keeper.
- Hmm.

1305
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:44,986
And you, miss,

1306
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:47,028
you are lucky to have a guy
like this by your side.

1307
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,615
As are you.

1308
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:51,427
Speaking of which, Lucas,
can I steal you for a second?

1309
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:51,493
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

1310
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:52,951
Thank you.

1311
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,041
Hey.

1312
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:05,873
May I take these?

1313
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,511
Hey. Patriot Catering?

1314
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:11,388
I'll be damned.

1315
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:12,615
How goes it?

1316
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:15,660
- Wait. This is the big event?
- Yeah.

1317
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:18,311
The most exciting night
of your life, right?

1318
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:19,521
So boring.

1319
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:21,648
You might just be serving
the next president

1320
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,149
of the United States of America.

1321
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:25,360
That dude?

1322
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:27,046
We've been catering for him
since before he entered

1323
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:27,737
the race.

1324
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:29,030
The lustre's worn off.

1325
01:06:30,031 --> 01:06:31,911
Plus, the boss doesn't want me
to spread around.

1326
01:06:32,742 --> 01:06:34,494
Makes sense.

1327
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,722
I mean, you probably do
business with the Republicans, too.

1328
01:06:36,746 --> 01:06:38,164
No, just Sterling.

1329
01:06:38,206 --> 01:06:39,374
Dean's loyal like that.

1330
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,418
I should probably get back
to work.

1331
01:06:41,459 --> 01:06:43,503
He likes us to move around.

1332
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:45,463
- Dean is here?
- Yeah.

1333
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:48,508
Talking to Sterling
and Jack Hampton.

1334
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,719
He's looking over here.
I better keep moving.

1335
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,390
I'll see you at the next one.

1336
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:00,687
- Hey! Gentlemen!
- Hey! How are you, sir?

1337
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:03,356
- Tom Mayfield.
- I'm Lucas.

1338
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,274
Nice to meet you.

1339
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:13,575
Hey.

1340
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:16,453
That was the owner
of your paper.

1341
01:07:16,494 --> 01:07:18,329
Don't worry.
I didn't embarrass you.

1342
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:19,371
Who else is there?

1343
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:21,583
Bunch of big donors.

1344
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:24,252
The guy on the right owns a slew

1345
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:25,754
of catering companies.

1346
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:29,299
Nate says that he is
a culinary mastermind.

1347
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:30,550
What's his name?

1348
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:32,302
Uh, Dean something.

1349
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:33,544
Everyone calls him "The Chef."

1350
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:36,806
- I gotta go.
- Hey. What? We just got here.

1351
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:38,683
Lucas, I gotta go.

1352
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:40,286
I haven't seen you in weeks
and you're leaving?

1353
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,311
Eli!

1354
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:19,766
How was it?

1355
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:21,601
Nick, we need to talk.

1356
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:24,270
Turnbull isn't embezzling money
from Super Millions.

1357
01:08:24,312 --> 01:08:25,313
Sterling is.

1358
01:08:27,148 --> 01:08:28,233
You think that's funny?

1359
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:29,317
No, I'm serious.

1360
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:33,780
Patriot Catering worked
his debate after-party.

1361
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:36,366
They have catered
all of Sterling's events

1362
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:38,618
since before he entered
the race.

1363
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,870
It was right in front
of our faces the whole time.

1364
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:42,580
Meyers & Goldstein,
they handled the books

1365
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:43,957
for Sterling's Super PAC
as well.

1366
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:46,292
Sterling reject
the Super PAC on principle.

1367
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:47,687
In the first month
of his campaign,

1368
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:48,628
he made a big show of it.

1369
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:49,879
But that did not last long.

1370
01:08:53,174 --> 01:08:54,968
Integrity Super PAC?

1371
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,594
That's an oxymoron.

1372
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:00,074
Yeah. He named it something
generic to keep a low profile...

1373
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:01,242
Yeah. Still, still, still,
this isn't definitive proof

1374
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:03,518
that he...
Why would he be that bold?

1375
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,312
Juice isn't worth the squeeze.
He's up three points.

1376
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:07,564
He is now.

1377
01:09:07,605 --> 01:09:08,833
But this time last year,
his name

1378
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,191
wasn't on a single poll.

1379
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,254
What's the only way to win
the New York City Marathon

1380
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:14,278
without any training?

1381
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:17,574
Take the subway,
sneak under the rope

1382
01:09:17,615 --> 01:09:18,950
- on mile 18.
- On mile 18.

1383
01:09:21,494 --> 01:09:24,581
But Mayfield,
that bow-tied prick.

1384
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:27,250
I mean, he's a Republican.
It doesn't make any sense.

1385
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:28,501
I thought the same thing.

1386
01:09:28,543 --> 01:09:30,754
So, I checked out
his voting records.

1387
01:09:30,795 --> 01:09:33,381
And it turns out,
he left the Republican Party

1388
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:36,009
right after Reagan rode off
into the sunset.

1389
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:38,720
The man has been an independent
for the last three decades.

1390
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:41,514
And then he reregistered
as a Republican the same month

1391
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:43,516
that Sterling's book
hit the best-seller list.

1392
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:45,643
It was all calculated.

1393
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:47,565
He must have thought
if people like us picked up

1394
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:49,915
a scent, it would throw us
off the trail, and

1395
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:50,939
it worked.

1396
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,985
What the fuck do we do now?

1397
01:09:57,405 --> 01:09:58,948
Follow the facts
wherever they lead.

1398
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:01,552
Sometimes,
it's not where you wanna go,

1399
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:02,827
but you go anyway.

1400
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,333
With just one week to go,

1401
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:13,046
Nate Sterling has pulled ahead
of Senator Turnbull

1402
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:15,256
for the first time
in national polling.

1403
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:17,902
While the lead is still
within the margin of error...

1404
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:19,969
Sterling is our megaphone,

1405
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:22,889
our voice of reason,
our moral compass,

1406
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:24,599
and our hope
for a better tomorrow.

1407
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:32,314
Shit, Eli.

1408
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:34,651
Where did you run off to?

1409
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:38,780
What's wrong?

1410
01:10:42,283 --> 01:10:43,283
You see your dad?

1411
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:47,473
- You're gonna have to scrap that speech.
- Why? The town hall's tomorrow...

1412
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:48,707
Because you're not a liar.

1413
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:50,458
What are you talking about?

1414
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,770
- He's funding his campaign with stolen money.
- What? Who?

1415
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:54,337
Sterling.

1416
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,297
- What are you saying?
- I have hard evidence.

1417
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:59,718
He's embezzling money
from the lottery,

1418
01:10:59,759 --> 01:11:00,945
and funneling
it to his Super PAC.

1419
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,679
What? That's crazy.

1420
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:03,972
It's the truth.

1421
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:05,074
Nick and I have been working
this story...

1422
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:07,684
No. Why are you telling me this?

1423
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:09,019
I guess I thought

1424
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,079
you might like to know
that your hero is a fraud.

1425
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,730
Hey. Stop!

1426
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:13,732
And because I need your help.

1427
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:15,775
Are you...
Are you listening to yourself?

1428
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:18,653
I need someone on the inside
to prove he signed off on it.

1429
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:21,865
Here.

1430
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:23,676
I need you to fill this
with Sterling's hard drive.

1431
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,386
- We don't have much time.
- You're delusional.

1432
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:26,494
Goddammit, Lucas!

1433
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:28,038
You're in denial.

1434
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:29,849
No. You can't
fucking help yourself, can you?

1435
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:31,791
Only this time,
when you blow yourself up,

1436
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,644
you could take me
and the whole goddamn country

1437
01:11:33,668 --> 01:11:34,812
- down with you.
- No. This is different.

1438
01:11:34,836 --> 01:11:35,837
This is real.

1439
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:38,840
Okay. Let's say that it is real.

1440
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:42,635
You go from reporting
back-page news

1441
01:11:42,677 --> 01:11:44,346
to being front-page news.

1442
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,931
I get what?

1443
01:11:46,973 --> 01:11:49,768
A seat on the witness stand
in the trial of the century

1444
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:51,037
when the only thing
I have witnessed

1445
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,355
is a good man
trying to save his country.

1446
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:56,483
We get hate mails
from our friends,

1447
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:57,484
the people we respect.

1448
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:58,651
And then what?

1449
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:01,571
Gun-toting, gay-bashing,
autocratic zealots,

1450
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:04,074
they declare us heroes,
and the navel-gazing,

1451
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,992
holier-than-thou woke mob,
they throw us

1452
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:07,034
a fucking parade,

1453
01:12:07,952 --> 01:12:09,272
congratulations
to the both of us?

1454
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:10,080
Lucas, please calm
down. And just think...

1455
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:11,622
No, you think!

1456
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:18,672
Are you willing to keep Penny
at war for the next ten years?

1457
01:12:18,713 --> 01:12:21,966
No. Are you willing to sit
on your hands

1458
01:12:22,008 --> 01:12:24,386
while the fucking Earth fries,
because I'm not.

1459
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,680
The money that he is stealing

1460
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:28,074
is coming from schools,
like that one in...

1461
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:29,808
That one in West Virginia.

1462
01:12:29,849 --> 01:12:31,935
Okay? Those kids,
Black and brown kids

1463
01:12:31,976 --> 01:12:33,037
are losing access to a fair
and equal education.

1464
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,021
Eli, it is so much bigger than...

1465
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,107
Don't you fucking finish
that thought!

1466
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:40,151
Why doesn't this matter to you?

1467
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:41,903
They matter!

1468
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:43,214
Everyone else in this country
can act like they don't exist...

1469
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:45,156
He is what this country needs!

1470
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:47,575
A liar is the last thing
this country needs!

1471
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:50,137
Liars are what fucked
this country up

1472
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:51,162
in the first place.

1473
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:55,709
Iraq has stockpiles of WMDs.

1474
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,585
The housing market
will continue to rise.

1475
01:12:57,627 --> 01:12:59,754
The election was rigged.
Redlining.

1476
01:13:01,172 --> 01:13:03,174
The war on drugs,
voter suppression!

1477
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:08,138
Everywhere you look, lobbyists,
pundits, bankers, preachers,

1478
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:11,433
billion-dollar industries
that run on lies.

1479
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:12,827
What is it that you want, Eli?

1480
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:14,894
- I want... I want the truth.
- Yeah.

1481
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:16,521
Well, you've been duped before,
so.

1482
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:24,904
Did you know, Lucas?

1483
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:29,798
I can't believe
you would even think that.

1484
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:37,876
I'm publishing this story
with or without your help.

1485
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,880
You publish this story,

1486
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:45,405
I don't want anything
to do with you.

1487
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:47,611
- That is not fair.
- What do you want me to say?

1488
01:13:47,635 --> 01:13:48,678
Love fades, values don't.

1489
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:01,191
That's my fucking jacket!

1490
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:07,489
Nice.

1491
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:32,638
Meet me at Recessions.

1492
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:35,850
Two blocks northwest
of Farragut Square.

1493
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:38,227
I have something.

1494
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:46,653
We prove that Sterling knew.

1495
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:47,838
- Eli.
- I'm going tonight.

1496
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:49,656
Well, Jesus Christ, Eli.

1497
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,074
You're being irrational.

1498
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:52,742
There's a right way
and a wrong way.

1499
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:54,584
If you want the ribeye,
you go get the ribeye.

1500
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:55,995
Not if it's contaminated.

1501
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:57,956
That ends a career
before it starts.

1502
01:14:57,997 --> 01:14:59,708
Well, already lost
my relationship.

1503
01:14:59,749 --> 01:15:01,001
I'm losing my dad.

1504
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,853
So, why not throw in a career
for good measure?

1505
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:04,677
You're losing your mind
is what you're losing.

1506
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:06,255
Wait.

1507
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:08,257
Relationship?

1508
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:10,885
Lucas refuses to...

1509
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:12,846
Oh, fuck, Eli!

1510
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:14,097
You told him?

1511
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:18,143
They'll have the place
power-cleaned in an hour.

1512
01:15:18,184 --> 01:15:20,645
Shit! Shit!

1513
01:15:20,687 --> 01:15:21,646
You're right.

1514
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:29,863
Eli! Shit!

1515
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:32,656
Fuck.

1516
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:34,742
Hello?

1517
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,703
Eli. Wait. Who is this?

1518
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:37,912
- Nick, put Eli on.
- Hang on.

1519
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:44,586
Just talk to Eli.
I'm sorry, Lucas.

1520
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:46,046
She just doesn't wanna talk
to you.

1521
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:47,087
Where are you?

1522
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,233
We're at Recessions
on 18th and I.

1523
01:15:49,257 --> 01:15:50,257
Bullshit!

1524
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:51,217
You're at the campaign office.

1525
01:15:51,259 --> 01:15:52,385
I'm on my way.

1526
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:53,887
Don't do anything stupid.

1527
01:15:53,928 --> 01:15:56,181
They sing karaoke this good
at the campaign?

1528
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:01,227
Shit! All right.

1529
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,021
Just tell her to stay
right there.

1530
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:50,652
Shit!

1531
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:58,785
What the hell
are you doing here?

1532
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:02,122
- It's past midnight. Lucas isn't...
- I have numbers, emails, names.

1533
01:17:02,163 --> 01:17:03,957
Sorry, what?

1534
01:17:03,998 --> 01:17:08,128
Tom Mayfield, Spencer Erickson,
Dean Clifton, Patriot Catering.

1535
01:17:08,169 --> 01:17:11,047
I have concrete evidence
of all parties involved.

1536
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:12,169
You give me one good reason

1537
01:17:13,216 --> 01:17:13,383
right now I shouldn't call
Secret Service

1538
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:15,092
and throw you in jail.

1539
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:17,029
- We'd be sharing a cell.
- Bullshit.

1540
01:17:17,053 --> 01:17:18,972
I would think twice
before you call security.

1541
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:21,474
The story is already written.
It's in the drafts.

1542
01:17:21,516 --> 01:17:24,978
You have me arrested,
it goes on Twitter instantly.

1543
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,813
Newspapers in the morning.

1544
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:28,273
What's this little story about?

1545
01:17:28,314 --> 01:17:30,108
- You know what it's about.
- Enlighten me.

1546
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,818
What it's always about.

1547
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,860
Money.

1548
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,907
- Did you know?
- Know what?

1549
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:40,493
All I know is I love my country.

1550
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:41,745
All right? I'm our best hope.

1551
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,039
I give us a fighting chance.

1552
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:48,710
Wow.

1553
01:17:57,844 --> 01:17:59,262
Are you a patriot, Eli?

1554
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:02,015
Patriots don't steal
from the American people.

1555
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:03,492
Who are you to accuse anyone of
stealing,

1556
01:18:03,516 --> 01:18:05,477
you fucking hypocrite?

1557
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:06,518
Give it to me.

1558
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,365
You know, I think you and I
have a lot in common, Eli.

1559
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:20,367
And for one,
we both lack experience.

1560
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:22,094
Turnbull and Archer are
canaries with that attack line.

1561
01:18:22,118 --> 01:18:25,038
I'm ahead
in every one of the polls,

1562
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,041
economy, hot buttons,
but the race, still a dead heat.

1563
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,376
Why is that?

1564
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:31,795
'Cause unfortunately,
for me and for you,

1565
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:32,916
experience seems to matter.

1566
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:35,881
The way I see it,

1567
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,052
your story
might cause a little stir.

1568
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:41,471
When it comes down to it,
who's gonna believe you?

1569
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:43,407
You lack the most vital asset
a journalist must have,

1570
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:45,308
credibility.

1571
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,894
Looks like I'm late
to the party.

1572
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:50,271
- Uh, Mr. Booker. What a surprise...
- Sit the fuck down.

1573
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:52,941
Now

1574
01:18:54,317 --> 01:18:57,320
let us all take a deep breath

1575
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:59,406
and talk this out

1576
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:02,242
like the rational people we are.

1577
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:03,368
Nate, don't say a word.

1578
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,595
Eli records everything
on her phone.

1579
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:05,995
- What?
- Let me see.

1580
01:19:06,037 --> 01:19:07,163
Get off! It's not on me.

1581
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:10,792
Hey! No, no. Leave him out.

1582
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:12,979
- That won't be necessary.
- Hey!

1583
01:19:13,003 --> 01:19:14,003
You wanna talk or what?

1584
01:19:21,177 --> 01:19:22,178
What the fuck?

1585
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:23,805
All right.

1586
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:24,847
All right?

1587
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:27,674
Let's just take a deep breath.

1588
01:19:29,477 --> 01:19:31,104
Sit down and talk this out,
okay?

1589
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:33,314
This is obviously some sort
of huge misunderstanding.

1590
01:19:33,356 --> 01:19:34,607
We know what you did.

1591
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:35,817
Okay.

1592
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:37,837
With all due respect,
I have no idea

1593
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:38,879
what you guys are talking about.

1594
01:19:38,903 --> 01:19:39,903
Maybe you don't.

1595
01:19:40,321 --> 01:19:42,032
But right now,
there are two assholes

1596
01:19:42,073 --> 01:19:44,200
saying you do.

1597
01:19:44,242 --> 01:19:46,911
There's no need for us to bluff.
We don't have a smoking gun.

1598
01:19:46,953 --> 01:19:49,622
But as my esteemed colleague
has no doubt informed you,

1599
01:19:49,664 --> 01:19:51,291
we've got the bullets,
the casings,

1600
01:19:51,332 --> 01:19:54,044
and the goddamn forensic report.

1601
01:19:54,085 --> 01:19:58,631
The whole story tied in a bow,
just waiting for the proof

1602
01:19:58,673 --> 01:20:00,383
that you knew about it.

1603
01:20:01,926 --> 01:20:06,014
If we do decide to print,
you got every news outlet

1604
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:09,434
in the country
on a scavenger hunt for proof

1605
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:11,935
of your involvement.

1606
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:14,296
There is no proof
of my involvement.

1607
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:16,459
The allegation itself knocks
you out of the White House.

1608
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:18,193
You'll spend the next few years
in court.

1609
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:20,862
And if you did know,

1610
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:22,572
the next couple of decades
in prison.

1611
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:27,202
So, the way I see it,
if you want any hope

1612
01:20:27,243 --> 01:20:31,247
of reversing this unfortunate
chain of events,

1613
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:34,459
you will tell us
the God's honest truth

1614
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:36,544
right here and now.

1615
01:20:37,587 --> 01:20:38,505
Okay. Uh...

1616
01:20:38,546 --> 01:20:41,383
But before you do,

1617
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:45,178
a disclaimer.

1618
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,597
I've worked in this town
for 52 years.

1619
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:52,352
That makes me one
of the world's foremost experts

1620
01:20:52,394 --> 01:20:54,604
at spotting a liar.

1621
01:20:54,646 --> 01:20:57,899
Lie to me, and you lose

1622
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:01,986
the election and your freedom.

1623
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:06,408
But lucky for you,

1624
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:10,578
the truth may still set you
free because believe it or not,

1625
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:14,582
I'm still grappling
with a truly punishing question.

1626
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:17,335
Is it worth it?

1627
01:21:27,345 --> 01:21:28,263
I don't have a party war chest.

1628
01:21:28,304 --> 01:21:29,304
Okay?

1629
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:32,284
This thing
was just a temporary fix

1630
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:34,060
to get me to the starting line.

1631
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:35,413
We were gonna give it all back
as soon as we're in a position

1632
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:36,479
to do so.

1633
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:40,710
This is no harm, no foul.
It's victimless.

1634
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:41,693
Tell that to the class

1635
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:43,945
of invisible kids
in West Virginia.

1636
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:48,033
I don't know.

1637
01:21:48,074 --> 01:21:49,274
How do we make this okay? Huh?

1638
01:21:51,494 --> 01:21:53,538
First interview
after I'm sworn in.

1639
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,166
Exclusives for eight years
after that.

1640
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:57,727
If there's a leak
coming from the White House,

1641
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,711
you're the two pots catching
it. You have my word!

1642
01:22:02,589 --> 01:22:03,589
Eli.

1643
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:05,716
What about Penny?

1644
01:22:07,093 --> 01:22:08,595
You worry
for your sister's safety

1645
01:22:08,636 --> 01:22:10,597
every day
that she's serving overseas.

1646
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:12,557
And with your father
undergoing chemotherapy.

1647
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:19,481
I can't imagine how hard
that must be.

1648
01:22:21,107 --> 01:22:22,359
And your sister, Penny, is it?

1649
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,486
Lieutenant Penelope James.

1650
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:27,155
We can work out

1651
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:29,574
an honorable discharge for her
the day I'm sworn in.

1652
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:31,135
Your sister deserves
to be with your dad

1653
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:32,160
during his treatments.

1654
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:35,413
If I wasn't so inexperienced,

1655
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:38,517
I would think you were using
a commissioned officer

1656
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:40,377
as collateral in a bribe.

1657
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:47,676
I would more call it
an agreement amongst friends.

1658
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:50,551
Look, I feel for you, Eli.

1659
01:22:53,848 --> 01:22:56,017
Cancer took my mom.

1660
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:58,269
And the emotional toll is hard.

1661
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:00,394
But the treatments add up.

1662
01:23:01,731 --> 01:23:03,358
And until we can get in there
and reform

1663
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,236
the healthcare system,
I don't want your parents

1664
01:23:06,277 --> 01:23:08,157
to be crushed under the weight
of medical bills.

1665
01:23:09,614 --> 01:23:11,324
And we can make sure
that doesn't happen.

1666
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,369
We are on the same team here.

1667
01:23:15,745 --> 01:23:17,706
And if you wanna make real,
lasting change,

1668
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:20,667
well, you just gotta play
the game,

1669
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,869
and that's the reality of it.

1670
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,798
You were supposed to change
the game.

1671
01:23:55,201 --> 01:23:57,829
I had a hunch I'd find you here.

1672
01:23:57,871 --> 01:23:59,497
I'm getting it all down.

1673
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:01,541
Everything that crooked,
fucking conman's done.

1674
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,793
We don't have enough to publish.

1675
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:08,131
- But he just admitted...
- Unless we find hard evidence

1676
01:24:08,173 --> 01:24:12,177
that Sterling himself knew,
we're just a couple of trees

1677
01:24:12,218 --> 01:24:13,678
falling in the woods.

1678
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:14,720
So, what do we do now?

1679
01:24:16,097 --> 01:24:17,182
Tear it all up.

1680
01:24:17,223 --> 01:24:19,142
Everything we know.

1681
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:21,436
I'll track Sterling to
his rally in Atlanta,

1682
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:25,440
and see if we can crack
the safe.

1683
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:03,645
Mom! Dad! Where are you?

1684
01:25:05,271 --> 01:25:06,271
I'm calling the police.

1685
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:08,510
They... they trashed
my apartment!

1686
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:14,215
- What are you doing here?
- Thank God you're okay.

1687
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,741
- I looked everywhere.
- No. Get out, Lucas.

1688
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:19,285
- Eli, calm down, sweetheart...
- Daddy.

1689
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:21,371
- Lucas told us.
- No. Okay?

1690
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:23,213
Don't believe a word
that he has to say. Okay?

1691
01:25:24,457 --> 01:25:24,499
This thing was just a temporary fix

1692
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:25,458
to get me to the starting line.

1693
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:27,454
We're gonna give it all back

1694
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:29,187
as soon as we're in a position
to do so.

1695
01:25:29,754 --> 01:25:31,506
This is no harm, no foul.
It's victimless!

1696
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:33,008
Tell
that to the class of invisible...

1697
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:37,429
Oh, my God.

1698
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:40,390
Did Nick know?

1699
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:42,183
No.

1700
01:25:42,225 --> 01:25:43,393
He still doesn't.

1701
01:25:44,811 --> 01:25:46,931
I had to commit, or his face
would have given me away.

1702
01:25:48,356 --> 01:25:50,400
And honestly,
I didn't decide to do it

1703
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,193
until I was standing
outside of the office.

1704
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:01,411
You know,
this doesn't fix everything.

1705
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:02,662
I know.

1706
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:04,205
I needed you to be wrong.

1707
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:07,916
I love you.

1708
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,670
It's all I got.

1709
01:26:16,009 --> 01:26:17,761
I need to tell Nick.

1710
01:26:17,802 --> 01:26:20,472
He's on his way
to Sterling's rally right now.

1711
01:26:20,513 --> 01:26:21,615
I'm flying with the campaign.

1712
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:23,266
I'll track him down
and tell him.

1713
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:24,869
- You go work on your story.
- I'll just call him.

1714
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:26,227
That might be difficult.

1715
01:26:26,269 --> 01:26:27,549
The last time I saw
Nick's phone,

1716
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:29,647
it was floating
in Sterling's coffee.

1717
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,234
Right.

1718
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,090
Nate Sterling

1719
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,300
will be in Atlanta tonight
while Senator Turnbull

1720
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:41,701
travels to Florida.

1721
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:44,013
And Nate Sterling is trending
on social media as excitement...

1722
01:26:44,037 --> 01:26:45,917
Senator Turnbull leads

1723
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:47,767
all candidates
in total campaign spend,

1724
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:50,353
having raised more cash
than both Sterling and Archer

1725
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:51,836
for the third month in a row.

1726
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:54,963
Lucas.

1727
01:26:55,674 --> 01:26:55,757
Hey.

1728
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,341
Did you find him?

1729
01:26:57,884 --> 01:26:59,070
Uh, no. Not yet.

1730
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:00,970
Where are you?

1731
01:27:01,012 --> 01:27:02,972
I'm by ATB.

1732
01:27:03,014 --> 01:27:05,016
- A
- declaration of Independence.

1733
01:27:07,894 --> 01:27:10,605
And some are calling Sterling
the most influential...

1734
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:11,898
Nothing?

1735
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,359
It's like a zoo with no cages.

1736
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:17,487
Here we
are at Nate Sterling's biggest rally yet.

1737
01:27:17,529 --> 01:27:18,529
He's about to do a hit

1738
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,680
on Politics Nightly
with Jane Bower.

1739
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:22,468
Tramping its way

1740
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:23,552
through America's
two-party landscape.

1741
01:27:25,495 --> 01:27:28,331
By two points
with just one week to go.

1742
01:27:36,339 --> 01:27:37,339
I got him.

1743
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:41,362
Just over a year ago.

1744
01:27:45,515 --> 01:27:47,600
Need to talk to him.

1745
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:49,370
- I need to talk to Mr. Booker.
- No access here, sir.

1746
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:51,034
Nate Sterling is set to take

1747
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:53,582
the stage any minute now
to make his closing arguments.

1748
01:27:53,606 --> 01:27:54,899
Shit. Call back when you get
him.

1749
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,254
By Nicholas
Booker, esteemed columnist

1750
01:27:58,278 --> 01:28:00,464
for the Washington Chronicle
and lion of the fourth state.

1751
01:28:00,488 --> 01:28:01,906
The election is a dead heat.

1752
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:03,199
If it's anything

1753
01:28:03,241 --> 01:28:05,011
like the last two elections,
it could come down

1754
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,370
to a few thousand votes
in a handful of swing states,

1755
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:11,875
or if it's a repeat of 2000,
a few hundred votes.

1756
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:14,669
Your column is read
by a few million.

1757
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:16,087
Your readers
really listen to you.

1758
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:17,380
They trust you.

1759
01:28:17,422 --> 01:28:18,840
I call it like I see it.

1760
01:28:18,882 --> 01:28:19,883
What do you see here?

1761
01:28:56,211 --> 01:29:00,006
Well, I have good news
and bad news.

1762
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:01,591
Which do you want first?

1763
01:29:01,633 --> 01:29:02,884
The bad!

1764
01:29:02,926 --> 01:29:03,968
NATE Right!

1765
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:06,888
Okay, here it is.

1766
01:29:08,598 --> 01:29:11,851
My little girl
turned 21 yesterday.

1767
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,081
And the first thing Alison did
was make sure

1768
01:29:15,105 --> 01:29:16,940
her voter registration
was current.

1769
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:22,778
Hello.

1770
01:29:23,863 --> 01:29:25,407
No. No, no, no, no. Slow down.

1771
01:29:31,496 --> 01:29:32,496
Okay.

1772
01:29:33,748 --> 01:29:34,749
Okay.

1773
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,253
And the other just sits
on its hands

1774
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:03,277
and whines about it.

1775
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,784
'Cause Alison deserves better.

1776
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:12,787
Our young people deserve better.

1777
01:30:12,829 --> 01:30:14,831
They deserve to look
forward to the future

1778
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:19,085
the way we used to with hope,
with pride, with excitement.

1779
01:30:19,127 --> 01:30:20,086
Holy shit.

1780
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:21,087
"Holy shit" what?

1781
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:27,135
Holy...

1782
01:30:28,178 --> 01:30:29,178
This is unreal.

1783
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:43,890
Oh. Hey, Lynn. I got it.

1784
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:55,080
So sorry for your loss,
Mrs. James.

1785
01:30:55,121 --> 01:30:56,706
Thank you.

1786
01:30:56,748 --> 01:30:59,626
And thank you for being so good
to my daughter.

1787
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:02,712
You and your husband have
raised a fine young woman.

1788
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:12,263
Let's...

1789
01:31:12,305 --> 01:31:14,015
How fast can you finish
the story?

1790
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:19,521
I'm about to bury my dad.

1791
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:24,609
Maybe you should just take over.

1792
01:31:25,985 --> 01:31:28,113
It's your story.

1793
01:31:28,154 --> 01:31:30,865
You found it. You pushed it.
You're writing it.

1794
01:31:33,535 --> 01:31:36,037
And if we're doing it,
we gotta be quick.

1795
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,831
We've got 24 hours, tops.

1796
01:31:38,873 --> 01:31:40,792
And it's gotta be airtight.

1797
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:43,044
I'll take care of the rest.

1798
01:31:45,296 --> 01:31:46,296
And.

1799
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:50,719
I'm sorry about your father.

1800
01:32:07,777 --> 01:32:09,279
Hello, Eli.

1801
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,920
Nick and I have a story

1802
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,460
ready for publication
that just might decide

1803
01:32:13,908 --> 01:32:15,177
the next president
of the United States.

1804
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:17,037
Is that so?

1805
01:32:17,078 --> 01:32:18,705
Should I be worried?

1806
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:21,207
Why do you wanna be president,
Senator Turnbull?

1807
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:23,835
Look, Eli.

1808
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:27,380
I assume we don't agree
on most policy.

1809
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:30,633
But one thing we do both value
is the truth.

1810
01:32:30,675 --> 01:32:32,719
So, I'm gonna give you mine.

1811
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:36,056
Right now, I am running
as the leader of my party,

1812
01:32:36,097 --> 01:32:37,891
but should I be fortunate enough

1813
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:39,976
to take that oath on January 20,

1814
01:32:41,019 --> 01:32:44,314
I will be governing
as the leader of my country.

1815
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:48,026
Our democracy is fragile.

1816
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:52,906
You protect it from the outside
by doing what you do.

1817
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:55,158
And if I get the chance,
I'm going to protect it

1818
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,787
from the inside
with everything I've got.

1819
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,289
And off the record?

1820
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,168
Take care, Eli.

1821
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:29,502
I don't understand.

1822
01:34:29,544 --> 01:34:32,088
What's... what's so special
about this one?

1823
01:34:36,134 --> 01:34:37,260
The day you were born.

1824
01:34:45,143 --> 01:34:46,478
I never got to say goodbye.

1825
01:34:48,063 --> 01:34:50,482
We thought it was another
false alarm from the chemo.

1826
01:34:52,984 --> 01:34:55,195
He knew that you were
at the Chronicle, writing.

1827
01:34:56,821 --> 01:34:58,031
He insisted

1828
01:34:58,073 --> 01:34:59,908
that that was where you needed
to be.

1829
01:35:02,952 --> 01:35:04,746
He loved you.

1830
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:08,917
He's so proud.

1831
01:35:25,141 --> 01:35:26,101
Daddy.

1832
01:35:38,363 --> 01:35:39,363
Okay.

1833
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:25,469
Where are you?

1834
01:36:25,493 --> 01:36:27,370
- Kevin?
- Hey, where are you?

1835
01:36:27,412 --> 01:36:28,556
I'm at my parents' house.

1836
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:29,956
All right.

1837
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:31,225
Meet me at the diner
on 4th and Delaware

1838
01:36:31,249 --> 01:36:32,417
in 20 minutes. All right?

1839
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:34,252
- I'm not doing that.
- It's an emergency.

1840
01:36:34,919 --> 01:36:34,961
What is this about?

1841
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:36,296
Look, I was fired.

1842
01:36:36,338 --> 01:36:37,255
Why?

1843
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:38,882
Because I... I know the names,

1844
01:36:38,923 --> 01:36:41,259
Tom Mayfield, Dean Clifton,
and Spencer Erickson.

1845
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:53,480
How the fuck do you know
those names?

1846
01:36:53,521 --> 01:36:55,315
The... the um... the other night

1847
01:36:55,357 --> 01:36:58,026
when you got that call
and you left in a hurry,

1848
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:03,573
well, you didn't log out.
And Gordon assumed it was mine.

1849
01:37:05,325 --> 01:37:08,495
Look, I didn't say anything,
'cause I was in shock

1850
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:10,246
and Gordon flipped for it.

1851
01:37:10,288 --> 01:37:11,848
I thought I'd be waking up
to a headline

1852
01:37:12,415 --> 01:37:13,975
that would change
the course of history.

1853
01:37:14,584 --> 01:37:16,184
So, why did I instead wake up
to an email

1854
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:18,814
informing me that the Chronicle
was terminating my contract?

1855
01:37:18,838 --> 01:37:20,078
I mean, I rushed to the office,

1856
01:37:20,715 --> 01:37:22,234
and security wouldn't even
let me in the building.

1857
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:23,938
Apparently, Gordon had HR
clean out my desk

1858
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,178
and wipe my desktop.

1859
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,097
Gordon killed the story
to save his own ass.

1860
01:37:28,473 --> 01:37:30,517
- Why... why would he...
- Jack Hampton.

1861
01:37:30,558 --> 01:37:32,519
He's a huge Sterling supporter.

1862
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,560
Gordon prints the story,

1863
01:37:34,604 --> 01:37:36,044
Hampton orders
his head on a platter.

1864
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:37,375
Gordon kills the story,
Sterling wins.

1865
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:38,542
Guess which paper
has a direct line

1866
01:37:38,566 --> 01:37:39,566
to the Oval Office.

1867
01:37:42,570 --> 01:37:45,281
So, Gordon is playing politics

1868
01:37:45,323 --> 01:37:47,992
dirtier
than the goddamn politicians?

1869
01:37:54,624 --> 01:37:57,419
Please nail that motherfucker.

1870
01:37:58,503 --> 01:37:59,587
I can't believe

1871
01:37:59,629 --> 01:38:01,149
you let Gordon think
it was your story.

1872
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:06,594
Look. I never said that it was.

1873
01:38:06,636 --> 01:38:08,972
And as it turns out,
I did you a favor.

1874
01:38:10,557 --> 01:38:12,559
So, you're welcome. Hmm?

1875
01:38:19,607 --> 01:38:21,109
No, Eli. I got it. Please.

1876
01:38:22,235 --> 01:38:23,236
You're unemployed.

1877
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:25,280
It wouldn't be right. Prick.

1878
01:38:30,952 --> 01:38:32,232
Have you shown Gordon the story?

1879
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:34,515
I'm waiting for you.

1880
01:38:34,539 --> 01:38:35,850
You should get to see
the look on his face.

1881
01:38:35,874 --> 01:38:37,514
- Where the fuck are you?
- I'm on my way.

1882
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:39,272
Whatever you do,
don't talk to Gordon.

1883
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:45,467
And I thought I'd seen it all.

1884
01:38:50,388 --> 01:38:51,389
We're doing this?

1885
01:38:54,309 --> 01:38:56,227
What?

1886
01:38:56,269 --> 01:38:58,563
The weight of the world
lies in the palm of my hand.

1887
01:38:58,605 --> 01:39:00,482
I guess I thought
it'd be a bit heavier.

1888
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,072
You know what this means
if we go through with this.

1889
01:39:11,534 --> 01:39:13,161
And you're willing?

1890
01:39:13,203 --> 01:39:16,206
I guess that's why they call it
the moment of truth.

1891
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,001
It's your story.

1892
01:39:23,296 --> 01:39:24,673
What?

1893
01:39:24,714 --> 01:39:27,592
No. I... I stumbled upon it,
yeah, but you guided me.

1894
01:39:30,762 --> 01:39:32,806
If you hadn't have gotten me
that interview

1895
01:39:32,847 --> 01:39:35,618
- at Meyers & Goldstein...
- You would have gotten it in some other way.

1896
01:39:35,642 --> 01:39:36,685
I doubted you.

1897
01:39:38,395 --> 01:39:40,397
You fought through the doubt.

1898
01:39:40,438 --> 01:39:41,523
You took me for the ride.

1899
01:39:43,149 --> 01:39:45,610
I didn't provide anything
that you didn't already...

1900
01:39:45,652 --> 01:39:47,362
You can now.

1901
01:39:47,404 --> 01:39:48,196
What?

1902
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:49,239
Credibility.

1903
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:52,742
Sterling was right.
Nobody knows my name.

1904
01:39:52,784 --> 01:39:56,329
And those that do
aren't so fond of it.

1905
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:58,289
If I were to publish this
on my own,

1906
01:39:58,331 --> 01:40:01,543
it wouldn't get any traction.
Or worse, it'll get dismissed.

1907
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:06,715
But coming from Nicholas
Booker, it'll be on every front page

1908
01:40:06,756 --> 01:40:08,591
and television network
in minutes.

1909
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:11,386
We need to do this together.

1910
01:40:12,804 --> 01:40:15,390
And after we break the story,
we can set up our own shop.

1911
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:19,227
No editor or parent corporation

1912
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:21,521
to tell us what
we can and can't print.

1913
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:25,525
A publication that answers
to nothing but the facts,

1914
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:26,568
wherever they lead.

1915
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:29,654
What would we call it?

1916
01:40:32,198 --> 01:40:33,198
The Independent.

1917
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:37,787
The Independent.

1918
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:14,407
You do the honors.

1919
01:41:36,638 --> 01:41:37,597
Thank you.

1920
01:41:49,651 --> 01:41:50,735
Now, what?

1921
01:41:51,986 --> 01:41:53,706
What do you say
we get the hell out of here?

1922
01:41:55,323 --> 01:41:56,783
And go where?

1923
01:41:56,825 --> 01:41:58,785
Watch the fireworks
from the hill.

1924
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:37,699
50 years, Gordon.
