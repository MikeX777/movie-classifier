1
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,060
Sasaki! Sasaki! Sasaki!

2
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:22,990
"Sasaki in My Mind"

3
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,650
Good morning.

4
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,910
Yeah...

5
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,120
How was your world today?

6
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,290
Um...

7
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,800
This person with the head of a cow

8
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,890
and a human body

9
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,810
was wearing a white bed sheet
over his head.

10
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,110
But the bed sheet was all red.

11
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,580
I don't know what happened
but it's definitely blood.

12
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,080
He's sitting

13
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,540
in the middle of a train

14
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,300
carefully holding a funeral portrait
of the deceased.

15
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:09,560
I can't see who this person is
in the portrait.

16
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,900
The train arrives at the station
but he doesn't get off.

17
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,570
I see... It sounds mysterious.

18
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,160
I wonder what happened.

19
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,800
I wanna go to a batting cage.

20
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,920
I thought you were sick of it.

21
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,680
I didn't have time to go.

22
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,890
I decided...

23
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,770
to move out this winter.

24
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,650
Okay.

25
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,910
You?

26
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Moving out?

27
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,710
I don't know yet.

28
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,310
Sorry.

29
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,270
We can switch.

30
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,190
Switch?

31
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I'll do that.

32
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,780
Hold on.
I'm getting the hang of it.

33
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,620
Okay.

34
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,330
I have a hard time handling
the boxes with my bad hand.

35
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,290
It looks painful.

36
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,170
I owned a pub

37
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,430
but it burned down in that fire
in Uguisudani.

38
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,930
The whole pub?

39
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,350
Burned to the ground.

40
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,730
It says "detergent-less laundry ball."

41
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,150
Huh?

42
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,780
Uh...

43
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,570
Right?

44
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,820
What?

45
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,330
This...

46
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,080
Right?

47
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,460
Cutting toe nails is

48
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,670
the most troublesome task in life.

49
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,589
I don't think so.

50
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,680
I totally do.

51
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,730
Going out?

52
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,770
Yeah. Out drinking.

53
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,150
Okay.

54
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,780
How was work today?

55
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,670
I assembled boxes and assembled boxes
and assembled boxes.

56
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,330
A box craftsman.

57
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,000
No.

58
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,720
Hello?

59
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,730
I'm on my way out.

60
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,230
Okay. I'll meet you inside.

61
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,360
Yep. See you later.

62
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,390
Look at all that.
I don't know most of them.

63
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,690
How is it going?

64
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,360
How's what going?

65
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,900
You know... Are you still acting?

66
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,190
No.

67
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,780
Are you gonna quit?

68
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,080
Things are looking up for you.
I saw the TV ad.

69
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm still struggling.

70
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,670
I thought I had a decent role in
a big film but it sucked.

71
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,590
All my other jobs are TV series.
That's it.

72
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,800
That's good.

73
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,430
No, it's not.

74
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,640
Give me one of your roles.

75
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,560
No.

76
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,560
I mean, you'll get your break soon.

77
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,060
Whatever.

78
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,160
Script?

79
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,040
"The Long Goodbye."

80
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,710
We should do it together.
Arrange it a little.

81
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,670
How will it merit you?

82
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,210
Merit?

83
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,090
Why now?

84
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,760
Yuji, I love your acting.

85
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,390
You don't have to say that.

86
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,190
You have to hang in there.

87
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,490
You said you didn't have
any talent but...

88
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,530
What about me?

89
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,910
You...

90
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,910
must have talent.

91
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,380
What else can you do besides act?

92
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
If there's something...

93
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,090
No...

94
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,240
Ishii! Ishii!

95
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,160
- Ishii!
- Yes?

96
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,990
Almost done?

97
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,450
One more round.

98
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,750
Yuji!

99
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Tada?

100
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,170
You work here?

101
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm a box craftsman.

102
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,720
Huh?

103
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,720
So what's up?

104
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,020
Everybody's asking me.

105
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,020
Of course.
Are you still acting?

106
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,650
You're doing business
with that company?

107
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,070
It was a cold sales visit.

108
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,070
Don't worry about me.
Don't change the subject.

109
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,990
Are you still acting?

110
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Yeah...

111
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,250
It doesn't pay the bills, huh?

112
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,410
No.

113
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,250
A tough profession.

114
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,920
I'll go watch you perform.

115
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,970
I'll let you know.

116
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,280
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

117
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,150
Sasaki was there.

118
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,369
What? Sasaki was there?

119
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,790
Yeah. He hasn't changed.

120
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,870
Too bad I missed him.

121
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,670
Where do you live?

122
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,960
15 minutes from Shin-Yurigaoka.

123
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,960
Keio line

124
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,630
Odakyu line.

125
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,180
You should've kept in touch.

126
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,890
You too.

127
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,640
You live alone?

128
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,690
No... I live with a girl.
My ex.

129
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,900
We still live together.

130
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,400
Why?

131
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,570
One of you didn't move out?

132
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,320
She's going to this winter.

133
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,320
Why did you break-up?

134
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,160
She probably got fed up with me.

135
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,380
You should enjoy yourself
with other women.

136
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,420
Enjoy myself?

137
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,210
I'll join you.
But don't tell my wife.

138
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,090
Why would I? I don't know her.

139
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,930
Women are the best cure for loneliness.

140
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,810
Find friends with benefits.

141
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,940
Before you know it,
you'll find your next girlfriend.

142
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,740
Are you talking about casual sex?

143
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,410
What else?

144
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,490
It's not like I'm looking for sex.

145
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,870
I won't rely on someone
to fill the void.

146
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,580
I hate that term
"friends with benefits."

147
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,630
Don't get so mad.

148
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,930
You're still in love with her?

149
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
What if I am?

150
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,390
I bet you haven't told her.

151
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,350
So what?

152
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,770
You should tell her.

153
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,690
One of these days.

154
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,610
People say that all the time.

155
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,070
"One of these days, I'll get married."

156
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,910
You don't want to face the issue.

157
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,290
You don't know anything about us
but you're saying I'm running away?

158
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,710
It's not just about her.

159
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,420
Then what?

160
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,970
Your life in general.

161
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,470
You're not living it like you want to.

162
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,230
It's obvious even to me
just after a few hours.

163
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,610
Mind your own business.

164
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,820
Right.

165
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,050
What the hell?

166
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,970
What was that for?

167
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,720
Sorry.

168
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,270
Yuji...

169
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,480
Stop talking shit.

170
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,570
Hey!

171
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,030
Yuji!

172
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,410
Stop it!

173
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,410
What should I tell my wife?

174
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,830
You're pretty strong.

175
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,590
I started boxing.

176
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,630
You did? At our age?

177
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,130
I hate to lose.

178
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,340
Lose to what? Grow up already.

179
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,930
I don't wanna lose.

180
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,190
You're taking after him.

181
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,030
Him.

182
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,240
You think so?

183
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,660
Haven't you seen him?

184
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,910
I did once.

185
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah?

186
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,760
Another round?

187
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,680
I've had enough.

188
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,430
Okay. I'll see you around.

189
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,520
Is this like boobs?

190
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Yuji, go faster!

191
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,100
I can't!

192
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,020
My legs are falling off!

193
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,190
Keep going!

194
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,190
Stop doing that!

195
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,530
Go!

196
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Go!

197
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,340
See ya!

198
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,380
Wait!

199
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,300
- Run!
- Go!

200
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,930
Run!

201
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,409
Hi.

202
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,870
Hi.

203
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,980
Were you drinking?

204
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,730
Your face.

205
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,230
Things happened.

206
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,900
You're kidding me.
Did you get in a fight?

207
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,320
Boxing actually came in handy.

208
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,540
What are you talking about?
What happened?

209
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,040
I was drinking with Tada,
a friend from high school.

210
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,920
We got in a fight with a stranger.

211
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,170
Unbelievable.
Start acting like an adult.

212
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,260
Talking with Tada
brought back memories.

213
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,390
Of what?

214
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,610
We had a classmate called Sasaki.
He's...

215
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,730
What?

216
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,070
He's a total idiot.

217
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,280
He always took his clothes off,
get buck naked.

218
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,490
Wow.

219
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,530
Even in front of girls
and on the streets.

220
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:35,210
We'd go "Sasaki! Sasaki! Sasaki!"

221
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,800
Then he'd go like this and
dance completely naked.

222
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,930
He's crazy.

223
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,140
He sure is.
The Sasaki call.

224
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,310
Crazier than you taking up boxing
and fighting with strangers?

225
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
I'm nothing compared to Sasaki.

226
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,440
You haven't seen him?

227
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,980
I saw him once after high school.

228
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,650
About 5 years ago.

229
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,160
Will you see him again?

230
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,580
I don't know.

231
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,330
You must've been good friends.

232
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
Why?

233
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:22,260
I haven't seen you this happy
for a very long time.

234
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,510
Really?

235
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,890
Really.

236
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,520
They're late.

237
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,360
I love that look on his face.

238
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,070
I wanna be like him.

239
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,950
Life is how you live it.

240
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,160
Yeah... You're right.

241
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,290
You should be an actor.

242
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,290
Yeah... You're right.

243
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,840
Yes. You should be an actor.

244
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,880
It just dawned on me.

245
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,590
- You're an actor.
- No.

246
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,430
You said I was right.

247
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,510
I did not.
I could never be an actor.

248
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
You're a fool.

249
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,690
You should because you can't.

250
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,350
You don't make any sense.

251
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,300
Why did you do it?

252
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,470
You're not yourself.

253
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,880
I get it.

254
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,180
You're in a void
like a kite without a string.

255
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,470
I get it.

256
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,890
You're watching life go by in terror.

257
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,020
Like a clown wandering in a graveyard,
reminiscing about the dead.

258
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,490
But it's over, Joe.

259
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,160
You're always saying goodbye.

260
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,200
No matter when. All the time.

261
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,210
Because... that's life.

262
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,670
A long, long goodbye.

263
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,760
And one day...
The final goodbye will come.

264
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,720
It'll be...

265
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,150
a goodbye to yourself.

266
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,570
Get out of here.
I want to be by myself.

267
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,240
All right.

268
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
But Joe...

269
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,000
Hold it right there.

270
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,380
Should I spend more time
looking at Silva?

271
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:57,350
This scene depicts your relationship.
Do what you think Joe would do.

272
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,430
Oops.

273
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,110
What are you doing?

274
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,030
Yay!

275
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,280
Something stinks.

276
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,570
Yeah.

277
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,080
It totally reeks.

278
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,370
What is it?

279
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,660
Moldy laundry?

280
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,670
Not my house.
My laundry gets crispy dry.

281
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,090
Then... what is this smell?

282
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,600
Me.

283
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,810
Stop giving me shit.

284
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,060
I love this routine.

285
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,730
Drop it.

286
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,570
So?

287
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,490
So what?

288
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,200
You're going to Tokyo, right?

289
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,200
Not again.

290
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,580
You should go.

291
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,290
Introduce me to Natalie Portman.

292
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,910
Who's winning?

293
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Me, of course.

294
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm ahead 3 to 2.

295
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,000
You know what?

296
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:18,050
Serie A and Liga... Liga whatever.
It's so confusing..

297
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,600
Why not use the same name?
Like Serie J in Japan.

298
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,390
No. That doesn't work.

299
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,100
Why not?

300
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,980
Right, Kimura?

301
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,110
What about Bundes J?

302
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,030
Sounds good.

303
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,360
It does not.

304
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,950
Your dad's not coming home?

305
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,280
I doubt it.

306
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,570
You sure?

307
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,750
I'm hungry.

308
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,000
You have instant noodles?

309
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,380
Yeah but instant noodles are my lifeline.

310
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,340
I want some.

311
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,850
The Sasaki Special,
coming right up.

312
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,150
Move. Don't play without me.

313
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,990
Hey... I think there's a hole.

314
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,110
Huh?

315
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
- No floor.
- Huh?

316
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,910
Keep it covered.
Stop moving it around.

317
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,920
What a crappy, floor.

318
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,750
There's a hole.

319
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,920
Are your friends here?

320
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,300
Yeah.

321
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,300
I need my seal.

322
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

323
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,760
I bought sashimi.
You guys should eat it.

324
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,810
Okay.

325
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,400
Sorry... Excuse me.

326
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,910
Sorry about that.

327
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,410
Valuables...

328
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,830
Important stuff.

329
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,460
Here it is.

330
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,130
Okay. Bye.

331
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,340
When are you coming home next?

332
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,350
When things settle down at work.

333
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,890
Okay...

334
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,650
You said he wasn't coming home.

335
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,660
I thought he'd brought
a woman with him.

336
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Does he?

337
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,160
Never. Look at him.

338
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,000
Laugh. It was a joke.

339
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,060
"Homerun"

340
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,820
<i>Homerun!</i>

341
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,570
<i>We have a homerun.
Congratulations.</i>

342
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,250
It's the timing.

343
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,340
- 3, 2, 1.
- Isn't it too low?

344
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,840
3, 2.1.

345
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,760
Ready? 3... 2...

346
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,640
Wait. You didn't say one.

347
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,560
- Here it comes.
- One.

348
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,810
I'm gonna kill you.

349
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,270
Again.

350
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,820
- Get serious.
- I am.

351
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,950
Get ready. 3...

352
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,950
I need a homerun.

353
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,910
Not in a million years.

354
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,960
I'm a former Nirasaki Yanchers.

355
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,960
What's that?

356
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,040
My baseball team in elementary school.
Don't you know?

357
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,170
Why would we?

358
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,590
Finished.

359
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,140
- I give up.
- Let's go home.

360
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,390
I'm hungry.

361
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,350
Vinegared dish.

362
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,400
Batting cage.

363
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,400
What's that?

364
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,150
A place to practice batting.

365
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,860
We were there.

366
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,410
Have you heard of it?

367
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,200
Sort of.

368
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,750
How's school?

369
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,750
The same.

370
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,930
Boring, huh?

371
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,190
"Survey on plans after high school"

372
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,790
It's starting.

373
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,590
Boom.

374
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,220
This is fun.
Where did you get it?

375
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,680
Kimura gave it to me.

376
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,270
Boom.

377
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,690
Why didn't you wake me up?

378
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,150
Because you were sleeping.

379
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,330
This is cool.

380
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,080
We can play against each other.

381
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:32,250
Okay... But... Just once.
I have to go soon.

382
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,510
You're serious.

383
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,590
I'm gonna beat you.

384
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,930
Not yet.

385
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,610
This is mine.

386
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,480
Hey... Hey...

387
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,440
- You knew that?
- Yeah.

388
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,080
Sasaki! Sasaki! Sasaki! Sasaki!

389
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,480
Sasaki! Sasaki! Sasaki!

390
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,450
<i>I dare you to say it again!</i>

391
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:47,080
If I were a girl, I'd never date a guy
like you who lets his dick hang out!

392
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,750
I can't believe you said it again!
Get up!

393
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,250
I said get up!

394
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,050
I'll take you on.

395
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,860
We're really doing this?

396
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,650
You can't beat me.

397
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,710
While you were painting in the art club,
I was practicing basketball.

398
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,790
While you played basketball,
I painted.

399
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,670
That's what I said.

400
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,800
Hey... Yuji! Kimura!
Kimura! Yuji!

401
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,850
You're my witnesses.

402
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,430
Seriously?

403
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,390
You're gonna lose.

404
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,730
Huh?

405
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,860
You're going down.

406
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,330
You're playing a different sport.

407
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,210
Miss.

408
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,920
- It's not rugby.
- Get in position.

409
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,060
Cheap move!
That wasn't fair!

410
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,030
<i>You can't beat him.</i>

411
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,070
<i>- Yes, I can.
- You just lost.</i>

412
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,160
I'll never play this again.

413
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,340
One day, I'll beat you in basketball!

414
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,680
You said never again.

415
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,850
Did I?

416
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,240
Plans for after high school?

417
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,030
I don't know yet.

418
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,740
You?

419
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,370
Yuji...

420
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,960
I don't wanna talk about it.
Don't be such a bore.

421
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,170
You can have this.

422
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,930
- I've read it.
- Read it again.

423
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,560
It'll do you good.

424
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,030
Your dad...
Has he been home?

425
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,330
Yuji...

426
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,670
What?

427
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,840
You really are boring.

428
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,350
Am I?

429
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,910
That was close.

430
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,080
I wanna homerun!

431
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,530
Who do you think is
the prettiest girl in school?

432
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,530
Why do you ask?

433
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,740
Just tell me.

434
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,320
Akari Ichinose.

435
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,990
You think so too?

436
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,330
What?

437
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,539
I'm in love.

438
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,870
With Ichinose?

439
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,830
Yeah.

440
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,000
You and her? No way.

441
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,300
I'm losing sleep because of her.

442
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,970
You're crazy about her.

443
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,890
Don't tell Sasaki.

444
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,100
He can't keep a secret.

445
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,020
Yeah... Maybe so.

446
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,070
Actually, he's good at
keeping secrets.

447
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,120
Catch it.

448
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,120
I'll never catch your pass again.

449
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,250
Hurry! Do something!

450
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,390
Sasaki! Sasaki!

451
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,310
Put your pants on.

452
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,140
Come here!

453
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,310
Don't get caught.

454
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,690
Where's his pants?

455
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,150
Go!

456
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,490
Sasaki! Stop!

457
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,070
Sasaki! Come back here!

458
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,500
He was out of here so fast.

459
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:33,320
"Okonomiyaki restaurant"

460
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,760
Hot.

461
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,069
{\an6}"Bad luck"

462
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,190
Didn't you also draw
"bad luck" last year?

463
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,910
They all say "bad luck."

464
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,160
I got "excellent luck."
Yuji got 'luck."

465
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,490
Shut up.

466
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,250
You'll draw "bad luck."

467
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,670
I'm not gonna draw one.
Waste of money.

468
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,340
It's not a waste of money.
This is our future.

469
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,260
Bad luck in your future.

470
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,490
Sasaki?

471
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,120
Don't throw it away.

472
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,960
My "excellent luck"...

473
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,220
What happened?!

474
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:17,480
Why? Why?
What's going on?

475
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,740
Sasaki... Sasaki...

476
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,070
Don't touch me!

477
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,200
I'm going home.

478
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,960
Make up an excuse for me
to Tada and Kimura.

479
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,150
Wash your hands.

480
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,240
Later.

481
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:14,660
Washing your hands later
would defeat the purpose.

482
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,630
Go wash them now.

483
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,380
Later.

484
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:33,930
Keep procrastinating and
you'll never get anything done.

485
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,100
You procrastinate too.

486
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:45,990
You don't hang up
the laundry right away.

487
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,030
It smells moldy!

488
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,080
You're right.

489
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,090
Sorry. Forget I said that.

490
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,320
Page 17. Lesson 3. Number 3.

491
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,030
Ichinose, read it.

492
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,450
Okay.

493
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,570
His first time to miss school.

494
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,700
Damn...

495
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,620
I fell asleep.

496
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,370
Good morning.

497
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,550
Where are the guys?

498
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,510
Hey went home.

499
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,970
Did they?

500
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,690
Any interesting news?

501
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,240
A baby elephant was born.

502
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,200
Oh.

503
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,790
Do you know how
adult elephants communicate?

504
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,080
No.

505
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:52,130
With low-frequency sound
that humans can't hear.

506
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,190
Your dad hasn't been home?

507
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,280
No.

508
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,870
Police?

509
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,040
I made a report.

510
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,090
Wanna go eat something?

511
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,340
No.

512
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,390
I'm into instant yakisoba these days.

513
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:49,400
It's good.

514
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,740
It's frickin' good.

515
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,620
Yuji.

516
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,710
Live your life.

517
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,840
You'll be fine.

518
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,270
Have faith in yourself.

519
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,670
"Beni"?

520
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,759
{\an6}"Monthly homerun awards"

521
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,140
Isn'it it "kurenai"?

522
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,390
Is that how you read it?

523
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,640
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

524
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,440
- Kimura.
- Yes.

525
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,320
Sasaki.

526
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:46,570
Sasayama.

527
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,200
Sato.

528
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,910
Sugiura.

529
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,330
Takahashi.

530
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,710
Tada.

531
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,880
Tadano.

532
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:09,600
! I'm sure you've all noticed
that Sasaki hasn't been

533
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,720
coming to school.

534
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:15,520
Yesterday...

535
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:22,190
his father passed away.

536
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,240
Sasaki...

537
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,200
probably won't be here for a while.

538
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:40,210
Ishii, Tada, Kimura.

539
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,590
Come to my office later.

540
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:49,640
There's something I'd like to
ask you guys.

541
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,430
Come during recess.

542
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,270
Don't look so glum.

543
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,570
Good morning. Good morning.

544
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,530
Good morning. Good morning.

545
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,370
Don't look at me like that.

546
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,580
Sasaki, shut up and sit down.

547
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,680
Class President?

548
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,560
Anything to say?

549
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,030
We need to talk.

550
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:48,820
Why?

551
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,120
Come see me later.

552
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,200
Okay.

553
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,020
Let's go eat.

554
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,910
- Cafeteria?
- Yeah.

555
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,750
Next class?

556
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,580
English.

557
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,750
English...

558
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,050
What should I eat?

559
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,760
Bread?

560
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,180
Sounds good.

561
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,480
Give me the Sasaki call.

562
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:15,660
Sasaki. Sasaki. Sasaki. Sasaki.

563
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:32,010
- Sasaki!
- Stop it!

564
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,930
Why?

565
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,560
Tell me why.

566
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,360
Why?

567
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,240
- Do it!
- No.

568
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,530
Why not?
Because my dad died?

569
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,870
But you always have fun
making me strip.

570
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,420
- Take it easy.
- Huh?!

571
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,130
Are you crazy? I'm fine.
So what if he's dead?

572
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,760
He was a loser...

573
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,980
Forget it.

574
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,940
You guys are so lame.

575
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,760
"Semi-permanent face soap"

576
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,740
<i>How's it going?</i>

577
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,610
<i>Not good.</i>

578
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:21,120
Only pockets full of dreams.

579
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,910
Same here.

580
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,750
That's life. What time is it?

581
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
4:10.

582
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,000
Turn on the radio.

583
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,330
No. No radio.

584
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,670
Why not?

585
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,090
Who cares.
Let's get back to work.

586
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,300
Let's go outside.
This place is depressing.

587
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:44,600
I have to stay and watch.

588
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,100
Let's go get a beer.

589
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,730
For 10 cents a glass.

590
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,190
Silva... Hold on.

591
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,690
What?

592
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,940
I was born on it.

593
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,200
It's just a plain old bed.

594
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,950
I was born on that bed.

595
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,290
My dad died on it.

596
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,750
A quick death, right?

597
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,210
Unlike other cancer patients.

598
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,130
He committed suicide.

599
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:27,220
I woke up that morning and
came to this room...

600
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,100
and saw everything.

601
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:38,070
He wasn't afraid of physical pain.

602
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,700
He feared the medical costs.

603
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,040
He wanted us to get
the insurance payout.

604
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,170
Sorry.

605
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,090
Let's take a break.

606
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,140
You're tense.

607
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,260
I'm sorry.

608
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,180
But in a good way.

609
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:10,850
Thanks.

610
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:16,440
Now I know why
Sudo wanted you to play Silva.

611
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,650
Unlike Silva...

612
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,660
if I saw a friend going
into a downward spiral

613
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:29,080
I don't think I can help him.

614
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,500
I appreciate the thought but
I'm not that strong.

615
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,340
What's wrong with that?

616
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,960
Huh?

617
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,430
People aren't necessarily lonely
because they're alone.

618
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,600
We can be lonely even with
people around us.

619
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:59,020
It's not easy to save a friend
from ruining his life

620
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:03,280
but I think you know how it is.

621
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,200
Yes.

622
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:12,410
You have to shine in
your own spotlight.

623
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:01,000
<i>- Hey, Yuji.</i>
- Sasaki?

624
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:02,590
What's up?

625
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:04,210
<i>Where are you?</i>

626
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,800
- Now?
<i>- Now.</i>

627
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,510
I'm back in town.

628
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,500
Yo.

629
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,690
How are ya?

630
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,980
What do you think?

631
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,530
You haven't changed.

632
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,830
How many years has it been?

633
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,330
I'm not counting.

634
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:34,800
It's been... What?
5 years since we graduated.

635
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,220
What?

636
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,850
It's been 5 years, I think.

637
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,570
Right.

638
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:55,830
That's cool.

639
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:57,990
Huh?

640
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:00,250
This is cool.

641
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:05,840
I know.

642
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,880
You haven't left?

643
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,630
Still living here?

644
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,810
Let's go outside.

645
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,730
I came back from Okinawa last month.

646
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:29,860
Okinawa?

647
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:35,449
Remember that sumo wrestler
who assaulted his apprentice?

648
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,450
Yeah.

649
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,660
Nat was talking about it
to a friend I made there.

650
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,660
He said

651
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:46,880
"You have no right to talk about it
when you have no backbone."

652
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,250
He went on for an hour.

653
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:54,260
He made me so pissed off.
I broke a beer bottle on his head.

654
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,430
What?

655
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:58,720
Were you arrested?

656
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:01,060
No. I paid him 300,000 yen.

657
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,310
Then later, I ran into him by chance.

658
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:10,360
He wanted me to apologize to him.

659
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,440
After I'd already paid him.

660
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:16,780
I said, "Sorry sorry sorry..."
Then he ran away.

661
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,870
What an asshole.

662
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:29,210
What about you?
You moved to Tokyo, right?

663
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,630
Yeah.

664
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,380
Have you improved your acting skills?

665
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,510
Sort of.

666
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,890
Gimme a break.
You better stay with it.

667
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,930
So what do you do now?

668
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,650
This. Pro pachinko player.

669
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:52,650
Cool. Good money?

670
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,740
Like 300,000 yen per month.

671
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:59,160
That's a lot. Nice.

672
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:04,450
But the hard part is

673
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:09,000
there's a fail-safe tactic
that guarantees a profit.

674
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:11,790
A sure win.

675
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,840
It's all over the Internet.

676
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:19,220
So even white-collar businessmen
can do it.

677
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:23,010
They're my number one enemy.

678
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,600
Are you serious?

679
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,600
Is Taka here?

680
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:29,940
Nope.

681
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,480
That's his bike.

682
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:32,730
1 haven't seen him.

683
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:33,980
Okay.

684
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,200
Yuji. Shinpei.

685
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,030
- Hi.
- Hello.

686
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,990
I'll be right back.

687
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,160
Hi.

688
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:48,750
How's it going?

689
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:51,580
Fantastic. I'm on a roll!

690
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:59,930
Are you Yuji, the actor?

691
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,050
How do you know that?

692
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,430
Because Sasaki

693
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,480
always brags about his friend
who's gonna be a star.

694
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,440
Same age?

695
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,730
I'm 22.

696
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,230
A year older than me.

697
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,360
I guess so.

698
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,790
- New machine?
- Yeah.

699
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,040
Tomorrow?

700
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,410
I'm going fishing.

701
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,330
Was he always like this?

702
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,420
He hasn't changed.

703
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:48,060
Come on. Thanks.

704
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,430
Good luck.

705
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,690
Yeah.
Yuji, break a leg.

706
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:53,900
Thanks.

707
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,870
You lent him money?

708
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,960
Yeah.

709
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,330
Why?

710
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,550
It's his crush's birthday.

711
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,920
Oh...

712
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:22,010
He's a good guy.

713
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,930
Sasaki...

714
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:29,390
Do you have a girlfriend?

715
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,430
Of course not.

716
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,980
I With a background like mine

717
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:35,610
who'd want me?

718
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:38,480
You have a point.

719
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:44,320
But before the shop opens

720
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:48,030
I get in line with the other old guys.

721
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,990
We talk about our strategies.

722
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,460
They're a lot of fun.

723
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,790
But I don't wanna be like them
when I'm old.

724
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,550
I'd rather die.

725
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,090
Find a job.

726
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,840
No.

727
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:12,060
An ordinary job is no fun.
I'm not cut out for it.

728
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,360
But a girlfriend...

729
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,730
would be nice.

730
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,160
<i>No. 41, please.</i>

731
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:41,710
1,171 yen.
May I see some ID?

732
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:45,170
What? Do I look like a minor?

733
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,090
It's a formality.

734
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,980
Thank you.

735
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:00,980
It's your birthday today?

736
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,980
Uh...

737
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,280
Look. It's today.

738
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:07,910
Yeah.

739
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,700
Happy 27th birthday.

740
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,540
Thank you.

741
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:19,500
From 2,000 yen.

742
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:44,340
I'm home.

743
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,670
You noticed?

744
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,930
How does it look?

745
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,590
Good.

746
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:57,350
Nice.

747
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,350
Thanks.

748
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:03,730
You're leaning on me.

749
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,770
Am I?

750
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,530
You're drunk.

751
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,280
It's a Friday night.
I had a few drinks.

752
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,900
Hello?

753
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,820
<i>Hello?</i>

754
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,660
Sasaki?

755
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:48,160
<i>I'm sorry to call you at this hour.
Is this Yuji's cellphone?</i>

756
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:51,290
Yes. Who's this?

757
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,960
<i>My name is Naemura.</i>

758
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,180
It really is late at night.

759
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,850
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

760
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,480
Is this your number?

761
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,390
<i>Yes.</i>

762
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:18,230
<i>In high school, you were good friends
with Sasaki...</i>

763
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,400
Sasaki?

764
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,570
<i>Yes.</i>

765
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,990
What about him?

766
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,580
<i>He...</i>

767
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,920
<i>passed away today.</i>

768
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:54,650
What happened?

769
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,860
<i>Sasaki is waiting for you.</i>

770
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,700
Um... Wait...

771
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,580
He's waiting?

772
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:14,710
<i>Sasaki is waiting for you guys.</i>

773
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,670
<i>So please come see him.</i>

774
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,550
"Open. Come and enjoy."

775
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,570
This man is a beast.

776
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,690
He stole your woman?

777
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,820
Did you tell him?
You said she was hot.

778
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:27,070
Big tits.

779
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,620
Gimme a break.

780
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,070
Just big?

781
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,160
Get in line.

782
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,590
Seriously. Just big and nothing else.

783
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,590
- Huge?
- Gigantic.

784
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:48,430
He was feeling her up.

785
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:51,050
Get in line.

786
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,270
What?

787
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:10,200
Get lost, asshole!

788
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,380
What are you waiting for?

789
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,100
He's a nobody.
Hurry up.

790
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,520
Shut up.

791
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,370
Get your hands off me.

792
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,300
Let go of me!

793
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:14,180
Fuck off!

794
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:18,270
Ow!

795
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:30,780
Let's go.

796
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:42,040
You're too late.

797
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:47,380
The old guys are already sitting at
the juicy machines you wanted!

798
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:30,460
<i>A fool... A fool... I'm a fool.</i>

799
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:32,050
<i>Love me...</i>

800
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:08,380
<i>Until I know what happiness is</i>

801
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:16,090
<i>I won't stop smoking
I'll puff away</i>

802
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:48,750
What's wrong?

803
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,040
Next song?

804
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,090
If I talk to a girl I don't know,
is that a pick-up?

805
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,720
Definitely yes.

806
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,930
Shit.

807
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:05,640
Did you see someone?

808
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,060
Yeah...

809
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,230
Is she hot?

810
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:15,110
She was singing this song...

811
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:16,780
What?

812
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:22,320
What should I do?
I really want to sing with her.

813
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,580
Ask her.

814
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,300
I'm going.

815
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,590
Where?

816
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,130
I'm going.

817
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:42,760
Where?

818
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,180
Where are you going?

819
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:19,300
Hello. Did you hear me knocking?

820
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,140
Yes. Can I help you?

821
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,680
Sorry...

822
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,100
I was walking down the hallway...

823
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:36,270
I heard you singing
all my favorite songs.

824
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:42,240
T thought... it'd be so much fun
if we could sing together.

825
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,700
I'm not trying to pick you up.

826
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:47,950
I just want to sing with you.

827
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,250
Sing karaoke with you.

828
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:54,170
You're trying to pick me up.

829
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:57,170
You think so?

830
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,340
I don't know...

831
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:05,260
Your name...
I'm Sasaki.

832
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:06,930
I'm Naemura.

833
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:10,390
May I sing?

834
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,560
Yes.

835
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,520
- A song.
- Okay.

836
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:18,020
- Can I sing here?
- Sure.

837
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,030
Sasaki?

838
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:26,410
Yes... I'm Sasaki.

839
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:28,699
"Karaoke"

840
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,990
I'm sleepy.

841
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,000
You're not sleepy?

842
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:33,830
No way.

843
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,500
- I am.
- No.

844
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,540
- Not at this hour.
- What do you mean?

845
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,550
Because it's this hour.

846
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,140
- It was fun.
- Yeah.

847
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,150
This way?

848
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,650
That way.

849
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:03,650
Okay.

850
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,080
See ya.

851
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:20,750
Bye.

852
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:28,390
Hey...

853
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:29,930
Did you get her number?

854
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:34,220
No. I wasn't trying to pick her up.

855
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:37,310
Maybe I'll see her again.

856
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,060
I don't get it.

857
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,480
There's nothing to get.

858
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:42,520
It's not like that.

859
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:46,280
I don't have ulterior motives.

860
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,410
See you again.

861
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,170
See you.

862
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,400
Yuji... Long time no see.

863
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,690
Yeah...

864
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:51,990
Hello.

865
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:54,070
Thank you for coming.

866
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,410
I'm Naemura.
We talked on the phone.

867
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:01,910
Yes...

868
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:04,040
I'm Ishii.

869
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:06,790
Yuji?

870
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,590
Yes.

871
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:18,600
Something didn't feel right.

872
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,430
But when I saw his face

873
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,980
I knew he was dead.

874
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:38,490
I thought about calling the police
and an ambulance but...

875
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:45,370
You're also weird.

876
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:50,460
Maybe so.

877
01:30:57,550 --> 01:31:03,520
He always talked about you
and Tada and Kimura.

878
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,480
You and Sasaki...

879
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,380
We're friends...

880
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:40,140
I guess.

881
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,400
Go.

882
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:22,020
Sasaki.

883
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:31,780
<i>He was diagnosed with cancer.
It was too late.</i>

884
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:36,580
<i>But he said</i>

885
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:42,090
<i>"No problem.
I can die without a struggle."</i>

886
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,050
The house is so messy but...

887
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,810
he'd invite me over.

888
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:36,220
Nice bath.

889
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,730
Yeah.

890
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:04,670
You're not bathing?

891
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:15,600
I'm sorry.

892
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:18,770
About what?

893
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:20,390
Yesterday.

894
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:23,650
Sorry.

895
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:31,740
Why apologize?

896
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:37,830
It was a bad mistake.

897
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:42,160
Bad mistake?

898
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,250
Having sex with me?

899
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,470
I know it doesn't change anything.

900
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:57,010
- But...
- I knew...

901
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:02,440
I kind of knew how you felt.

902
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:05,350
So I'm moving out.

903
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:08,900
Yesterday was my mistake.

904
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:12,320
I'm sorry.

905
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,920
Your apology hurts the most.

906
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,490
You called me just in time.

907
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:00,830
Thanks.

908
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:05,660
Don't worry about it.
We were just leaving the restaurant.

909
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:08,670
You weren't answering my calls.

910
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,500
Why get in a fight tonight?

911
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,050
You idiot.

912
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:14,260
Yeah.

913
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,470
Whatever.

914
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:24,100
His funeral is tomorrow.

915
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:28,100
Sasaki's funeral.

916
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,730
They're doing everything at once.

917
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:37,570
So much is happening all at once.

918
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:41,080
It's hard to keep up.

919
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:45,250
He has relatives but...

920
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:50,290
They want to wrap things up quickly.

921
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,260
I see.

922
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:06,350
Sasaki... He was lying there
like he was pretending to be asleep.

923
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:09,230
Yeah.

924
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,940
Was it us?

925
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,780
Were we making him strip?

926
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:27,250
In that case...
If we started the Sasaki call...

927
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:29,670
Maybe he would've...

928
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:30,880
Yuji.

929
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,460
Sasaki is gone.

930
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:40,760
He looked peaceful.

931
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:55,400
It's nobody's fault.
Not ours. Not his. Not anybody's.

932
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:08,410
"Batting cage"

933
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:35,110
Damn, I suck.

934
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:48,580
Hey.

935
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,480
"No. 1: Sasaki,
50 homeruns"

936
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,790
Yuji.

937
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,260
Time to get up.

938
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:45,430
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

939
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:46,640
Breakfast?

940
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:47,600
Thanks.

941
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,010
It's almost ready.

942
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:50,350
Thanks.

943
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:51,470
You can wear this.

944
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,640
Thanks.

945
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:11,540
Good morning.

946
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:14,330
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

947
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:15,500
Yeah.

948
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:18,670
Good. Wanna eat?

949
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:20,590
Thanks.

950
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:23,420
Take a seat.

951
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:28,590
Thank you.

952
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:31,680
Let's eat.

953
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:38,480
It feels weird.

954
01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:42,480
What do you mean?

955
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:47,570
Seeing my old classmates
as a husband and wife.

956
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,450
Yeah.

957
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:57,370
Hot.

958
01:43:57,710 --> 01:43:58,710
Too hot?

959
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:04,710
Oh yeah...

960
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:32,370
Takahito.

961
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:34,950
4 months old.

962
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,250
Wanna hold him?

963
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:39,330
I don't know how.

964
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:42,000
I've never held a baby before.

965
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,680
Here.

966
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:03,770
Sorry...

967
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:05,940
Sorry.

968
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,580
Sorry.

969
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:24,710
Sorry, kid.

970
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,260
Sorry...

971
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:57,160
I'm sorry. Sorry...

972
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:38,160
I have to go.

973
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:40,990
Go where?

974
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:44,460
I have to go say something.

975
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:48,090
Sorry.

976
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:51,840
Thanks, you guys.

977
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:44,730
Where did you spend the night?

978
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:45,850
At Kimura's place.

979
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:54,480
You don't look good in a suit.

980
01:47:58,490 --> 01:48:01,740
I'm also going to move out.

981
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:11,080
Under that kitchen hood,
we smoked together.

982
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:16,920
We ate weird stuff on
that weird table I made.

983
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:21,470
There are so many memories
I don't want to forget.

984
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:29,940
If I move out,
I know I'll start to forget.

985
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,320
I was afraid of that.

986
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,200
I'm the selfish one.

987
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:48,410
I knew how you felt but
I kept living with you.

988
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:54,090
I pretended I was right.

989
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:57,590
I lied a lot too.

990
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,930
Lied?

991
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:05,010
I said I had to work late but

992
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:08,560
I was out drinking
with other guys.

993
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:14,400
I said I just needed space

994
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:18,240
but there's someone I'm attracted to.

995
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:24,950
It was me

996
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:29,040
who couldn't let go and move on.

997
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:53,400
Yesterday?

998
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:58,650
What kind of world was it?

999
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,120
I forgot.

1000
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,410
Are you serious?

1001
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:21,840
Thank you...

1002
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:28,810
for all these years.

1003
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:31,390
Me too.

1004
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:35,350
Thank you.

1005
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:39,320
Go.

1006
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:46,280
See your friend and
burn his face into your memory.

1007
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,540
Okay.

1008
01:51:19,610 --> 01:51:21,780
You're not yourself.

1009
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,610
I get it.
You're in a void like a kite...

1010
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:30,030
<i>without a string.</i>

1011
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,540
I get it. You're...

1012
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:39,580
<i>watching life go by in terror.</i>

1013
01:51:40,210 --> 01:51:46,170
Like a clown wandering in a graveyard,
reminiscing about the dead.

1014
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:49,300
But it's over, Joe!

1015
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,180
<i>There's nothing we can do!</i>

1016
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:59,310
One day, we'll write a story about this.

1017
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,650
An empty elegy!

1018
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:06,650
<i>But for now, let's keep going!</i>

1019
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,450
Let's drink!

1020
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:13,370
The world is rushing forward!
We have to keep up!

1021
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:18,750
But there's at least time
to say goodbye, isn't there?!

1022
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:22,040
<i>Goodbye?!</i>

1023
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:25,920
That word isn't in my dictionary!

1024
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:27,550
There's only hello!

1025
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,180
<i>Don't try to fool me!</i>

1026
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:33,140
You're always saying goodbye!

1027
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:36,520
No matter when! All the time!

1028
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:39,520
<i>Because that's life!</i>

1029
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,770
A long, long goodbye!

1030
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:47,190
And one day...

1031
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:51,570
<i>the final goodbye will come!</i>

1032
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:53,410
It'll be...

1033
01:52:54,330 --> 01:52:56,830
<i>a goodbye to yourself!</i>

1034
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:54,300
Sasaki!

1035
01:53:55,600 --> 01:54:00,730
Sasaki! Sasaki! Sasaki! Sasaki!

1036
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,350
<i>Great song.</i>

1037
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:47,520
<i>I love this song.</i>
