00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,169
Hey, guys, Graham here.
How's it going?

3
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:36,772
Today marks
the two-year anniversary

4
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:39,541
since I've been making
videos for the internet.

5
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:41,144
Whoo.

6
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,213
So because of that,
I wanted to do something

7
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:46,282
a little bit different.

8
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:48,084
So I'm going
to tell you two stories.

9
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:50,719
Two stories that I think sum up

10
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:54,023
what it's like to make
videos for the internet.

11
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:55,724
And it might get
a little abstract,

12
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:57,692
so please bear with me.

13
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:03,565
First story is about
paratroopers in World War II.

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,901
Obviously.

15
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:09,072
But specifically
I'm talking about D-Day.

16
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:14,077
Now, obviously,
there were a lot of

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,813
fatalities and, um,
casualties that day.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,951
But there was one bizarre
and common injury

19
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,420
that was caused

20
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:26,222
not by the enemy,

21
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:29,925
but by the perceptions
of the soldiers themselves.

22
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:36,731
<i>You see, a lot of paratroopers
missed their targets.</i>

23
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:41,337
<i>They ended up in ponds
or lakes or trees or whatever.</i>

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,738
<i>Some of them ended
up on rooftops.</i>

25
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:47,009
<i>Now, think of yourself
in that situation,</i>

26
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:49,678
<i>you land on a rooftop,
what would you do?</i>

27
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:53,015
<i>You'd probably try
and climb down into a window</i>

28
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,950
<i>on the upper story
and get inside,</i>

29
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:56,352
<i>just take the stairs downstairs.</i>

30
00:01:57,386 --> 00:02:00,655
<i>Well, what a lot
of these paratroopers did...</i>

31
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,393
<i>was they walked up
to the edge of the roof...</i>

32
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:07,029
<i>and just jumped off.</i>

33
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:10,433
<i>Just multiple stories,
straight down to the ground,</i>

34
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,767
<i>breaking their legs or worse.</i>

35
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,937
<i>You see,
what was happening was...</i>

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,742
<i>they'd just jumped
a thousand feet and survived.</i>

37
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:24,880
<i>So to them,
looking down from the roof...</i>

38
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,450
<i>the drop to the ground
was nothing.</i>

39
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:31,720
<i>With just a slight change
in their perception...</i>

40
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:36,825
<i>they'd managed to change
an inherent truth...</i>

41
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,363
<i>that if you jump off of a roof,
you're going to hurt yourself...</i>

42
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:42,465
<i>into a fallacy.</i>

43
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:47,303
That's the first story.

44
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:49,838
Second story

45
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:52,008
is a little bit more personal,

46
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,443
and is about my friend Stephen.

47
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:59,215
<i>So, Stephen's a photographer
and a traveler.</i>

48
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,285
<i>He went all around the world,</i>

49
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:03,952
<i>took photos wherever he went.</i>

50
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:08,191
<i>And I thought that
he should share these online.</i>

51
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:10,493
<i>So I encouraged him
to set up a blog.</i>

52
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:15,064
<i>He was resistant at first,
but ultimately he did it.</i>

53
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:19,468
<i>And people started following and
sharing their opinions on his work.</i>

54
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,338
<i>Some good, some not so good.</i>

55
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,906
<i>This is the internet after all.</i>

56
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:29,744
<i>And it was around then
that things got scary.</i>

57
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,451
<i>He sent me a photo
with only this caption:</i>

58
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,820
<i>"Can you see it?"</i>

59
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,489
<i>This is the photo.</i>

60
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:41,524
<i>Can you see it?</i>

61
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:55,371
<i>After Stephen insisted that
the photo wasn't faked...</i>

62
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,274
<i>he proceeded to send more.</i>

63
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,050
<i>But that wasn't
the weirdest thing...</i>

64
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:11,020
<i>I asked him what
he thought was causing it,</i>

65
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,322
<i>or what it was.</i>

66
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:17,193
<i>And what he said to me really</i>

67
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:20,096
<i>freaked me out for a long time.</i>

68
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:25,501
<i>He said,
"Can't you see it, Graham?</i>

69
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:27,503
<i>It's you."</i>

70
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:33,942
I didn't hear from Stephen
for a good while after that.

71
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,280
And it wasn't until
a couple of years later

72
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:40,049
that I bumped into him
and I was able to ask him

73
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:41,950
about the photos,

74
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,254
and whether he was still getting
any weird apparitions in them.

75
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:49,091
And he said to me,
it, it was funny.

76
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,263
He hadn't seen anything
strange in the photos

77
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,198
since the day that
he shut his blog down.

78
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:04,106
Anyway, that's, uh,
that's all from me today.

79
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,475
Sorry it's a bit
doom and gloom today.

80
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,079
Um, things will be back
to normal next week, um.

81
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,881
Uh, it'll be a bit more
upbeat, hopefully.

82
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:15,251
Um, but, yeah, as always...

83
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,187
what's the worst
that could happen?

84
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,660
Where to start?

85
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,063
Hello!

86
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,597
Walkies.

87
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,133
Walkies. Walkies.

88
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,069
Walkies.

89
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:35,037
Graham...

90
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:39,841
He's a fud.

91
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:42,378
I've never met anyone that could

92
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:43,945
dedicate so much time and energy

93
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,182
to just doing something stupid.

94
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,287
Got any, uh...

95
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:55,024
- bags for life?
- Aye, they'll cost you extra.

96
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:56,925
- Target's holding, move, move.
- F###!

97
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,965
No, no, he pretended
he didn't give a shit

98
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,168
what people thought but,

99
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:08,204
he obviously did.

100
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:11,140
He would do anything

101
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,509
if he thought
it would make people laugh,

102
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:16,712
or advance his career
or his persona or whatever.

103
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,581
<i>When you find
yourself hiding a stash...</i>

104
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:22,051
I don't know if
I'd call him obsessed, but...

105
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:24,520
He was obsessed.

106
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,558
He didn't think things
through before he did them.

107
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:33,962
And a lot of times
his ideas were just bad ideas.

108
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,065
And they often failed.

109
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:48,210
He's an asshole,
but he's my asshole.

110
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:50,045
This is
the ice bucket challenge.

111
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,016
I nominate Iain
and Barack Obama.

112
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,126
<i>So how did
this whole thing start then?</i>

113
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,128
Well...

114
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,632
it was
the laser eye surgery video.

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,701
Um, obviously...

116
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,672
it wasn't like
any of his other videos,

117
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,073
he mostly stuck to

118
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:21,143
comedy, of course.

119
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:22,445
But now...

120
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,481
now, I don't really know
what to think.

121
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:26,582
Why?

122
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:31,253
I just, I can't, I can't watch
that video any more.

123
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:33,589
Why not?

124
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,624
It scares me.

125
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:39,295
I mean,

126
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,530
I've dramatized
it after the fact...

127
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:45,501
exaggerated a little,

128
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,736
some would say sensationalized.

129
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:51,740
But, watch the video
for yourself,

130
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:54,143
I'm not going to tell
you what the fuck to think.

131
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:55,711
The video was live streamed,

132
00:07:55,744 --> 00:08:00,015
so once it was done,
it was online, and...

133
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,786
...people were scared.

134
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:14,730
Great, so, that is,
you ready now?

135
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:16,031
Okay, where's the button?

136
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:17,833
- Um, that one.
- Cool, yeah.

137
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,235
And that's going
to start the live stream.

138
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:20,669
- Okay, cool.
- Cool.

139
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:22,171
And the camera's rolling, yeah?

140
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:23,105
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

141
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:24,139
Cool.

142
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,041
- Happy? Okay.
- Yes.

143
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,443
Right,
I'm going to head out then.

144
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,245
- Um.
- Okay.

145
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:33,349
- I will be 20 minutes or so.
- Aye, should be long enough.

146
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,251
Yeah, do you want...

147
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:38,454
- I'm going to grab party rings.
- Nice.

148
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:40,523
Because we love party rings.

149
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:41,857
- Beer.
- Yeah.

150
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,659
And, yeah.

151
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:45,628
- That'll probably be it, really. And, yeah...
- Awesome.

152
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:49,164
Just sort of, don't be weird
and don't do anything stupid.

153
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:51,534
- Okay.
- Don't take off your bandages.

154
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,069
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- That's really important, the doctor said that.

155
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,471
I know, he said it,
like, five times.

156
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,239
I know, well, remember it,
it's important.

157
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:58,541
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

158
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,042
- All right, okay, bye.
- Bye, see you.

159
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:04,713
And hopefully that's
us streaming.

160
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,850
I am Graham,
welcome to my live stream.

161
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:11,420
Uh, this was the one that
I mentioned on Twitter

162
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:14,390
that I was going to be
doing about the aftermath

163
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,258
of my laser eye surgery,

164
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,193
which I had this afternoon.

165
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:19,361
Uh,

166
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,263
clearly, it didn't go to plan.

167
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:25,834
You know, you don't usually come
out of laser eye surgery

168
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,103
with a blindfold on,
or bandages,

169
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:29,672
or whatever it is
they've put on me.

170
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:31,307
But, uh, yeah,
they made a mistake.

171
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,177
So I am blind
for the next 24 hours,

172
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,779
until I can take this off.

173
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:39,915
They said that if I, uh,
take it off too early,

174
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,650
I could get permanent damage.

175
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:46,722
So I've not to take it off
under any circumstances, um,

176
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:49,358
but that's fine, because Erin's
coming back in 15 minutes,

177
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:51,594
and she's going to look after me

178
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:53,562
for the rest of the day and,

179
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:56,498
um, make sure I don't destroy
the flat with, you know,

180
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,534
some Mr. Magoo style antics,

181
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,769
just bashing
into things and stuff.

182
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:03,772
Um, but, yeah, I was going
to be answering your questions

183
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,341
as they came in, but...

184
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:09,445
Erin?

185
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:13,916
Erin?

186
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,153
Oh, Jesus!

187
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:21,857
Erin.

188
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,295
Erin, are you fucking with me?

189
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,199
Because that's pretty mean.

190
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:34,470
Erin?

191
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,874
Please tell me
you're fucking with me.

192
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,550
Okay, fuck this.

193
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:02,765
Erin?

194
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,636
I can't see fucking shit here.

195
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:12,207
Erin?

196
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:36,498
Oh, my God,
what did I just watch?

197
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:39,868
Actual evidence, finally someone
records a ghost sighting

198
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:42,504
on a camera that didn't go out
of production in the '60s.

199
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:43,539
Hallelujah.

200
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:44,973
Either this guy staged it,

201
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,942
or he had the weirdest
home invasion in history.

202
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:48,777
Halle-fucking-lujah.

203
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:50,013
Still creepy though.

204
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,585
Well, ghost or not,
something was in his house.

205
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,787
And that's what made
it really scary.

206
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:01,957
I'd seen his acting,
he's not that good.

207
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,294
I assumed he just used
like, fishing line

208
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,730
and maybe tried to remove it
post production or something,

209
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,066
but I didn't think Graham
had it in him

210
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,502
to do something like that,
or to fool us like that.

211
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,304
People wanted to know more,

212
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,506
so, that was our way in.

213
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:28,650
You know you're going
to have to go back.

214
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:31,887
I don't want to talk about it.

215
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,390
Yeah, well, it's been
three weeks now, so.

216
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:37,359
I'm trying to do something here.

217
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,530
Graham, you can't
just ignore it.

218
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,901
Look, what's your plan here?
You're just going

219
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,771
to stay in my flat and what?
Make bottle videos?

220
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,374
For your information,
bottle flipping

221
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:53,542
is a legitimate skill.

222
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:56,311
And it's trending
massively right now, so.

223
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:58,514
Ah, fuck's sake, Graham.

224
00:12:58,547 --> 00:12:59,948
Look, listen to me!

225
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,585
Whatever you saw,
whatever happened,

226
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,687
you can either get the police
to investigate it...

227
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:08,791
or you.

228
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:11,094
You can go and investigate it,
yourself.

229
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,595
Oh, man, look, you've been
waiting for a video

230
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,064
to go viral for years.

231
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:18,367
And now there's one that's just
handed to you on a platter,

232
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,302
and, and you're just
going to ignore it?

233
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,973
Just do it.

234
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:26,042
Just use it.

235
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,611
I'll come with you,
we'll go back to the flat,

236
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,980
we'll, we'll investigate it,
we'll document it.

237
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,384
And if it's real,

238
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,552
whatever you saw...

239
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,955
Oh, my God, like,
can you imagine?

240
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:42,025
A real fucking ghost.

241
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,028
Look.

242
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:48,363
Think about it.

243
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:51,667
You in?

244
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,809
So, here we are, uh,
back at my flat.

245
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:02,578
Erin convinced me to come back,

246
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:04,379
um, you know,

247
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:07,116
to investigate the ghost.

248
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,020
The ghost, this alleged ghost
that exists in his flat.

249
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:12,521
Yeah, alleged, alleged.

250
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:14,857
Alleged.

251
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,493
So, yeah, we're going
to go in there, um.

252
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:19,862
Erin's packing heat.

253
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:22,664
- You know...
- I'm ready. I'm really prepared.

254
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:24,933
I'm, I'm kind of,
I'm pretty nervous,

255
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,603
I feel a bit weird,
but I'm...

256
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,738
I'm, I'm just going to stand
behind Erin as she...

257
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,807
- Yeah, okay.
- But, anyhow, here we go.

258
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,109
- Okay.
- Let's see.

259
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,877
Do it! Am I going first?

260
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,645
Yeah, of course.

261
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:37,913
Of course you're going first.

262
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,849
You're too kind. Oh, my God.

263
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,652
Okay, all good.

264
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:51,460
This is really creepy.

265
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,462
Why am I so nervous?
It's stupid.

266
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:55,964
I don't know, it looks all fine.

267
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:58,667
There's no reason
to be nervous or, uh...

268
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,739
- Fuck.
- What is it?

269
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,176
You're fucking with me.

270
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,012
- You're fucking with me!
- What? No.

271
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:11,180
Yeah, you are, oh, my God,
what the hell?

272
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:14,583
Fucking flat.

273
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:15,784
Holy shit.

274
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:20,123
It's like...

275
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:25,894
what, what,
why would someone do that?

276
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:28,097
Like, if someone come into
your flat, what, would they just

277
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,831
tip things all over the place?

278
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:32,268
That makes no sense.

279
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:35,171
Like, that's really
freaking me out, Graham.

280
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:36,939
Well, it wasn't me.

281
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,741
Shut up, I don't believe you.

282
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,611
I don't believe you!

283
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:45,614
Are you serious?

284
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,883
- You didn't do this?
- I didn't do this, no.

285
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,852
This is really,
that's really horrible.

286
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,188
They've left the laptop.

287
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:54,623
- Oh, good.
- And the TV.

288
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:57,193
Well,
ghosts don't really use laptops, so.

289
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:00,629
Oh, my God.

290
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:02,798
Oh, my God,
that's really messed up.

291
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,033
- What is it?
- Look.

292
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,272
What the fuck is that?

293
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:11,773
Oh, my God, that's like...
sorry.

294
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:14,676
It's like,
"Prepare for laughter."

295
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,778
That makes no sense whatsoever.

296
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:21,217
It's really freaking me out,
it's really, like,

297
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,220
I don't know, like, why would
someone come in here and like,

298
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:26,055
like, fucking write
on your wall?

299
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,889
It's just some sort
of sick joke or something.

300
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,825
Yeah, unless you're still
pulling my leg, because.

301
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,195
No, no it's not, no, come on.

302
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:33,762
Because that'd be really
messed up if that is,

303
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:37,033
- no, not impressed.
- No, Erin, honestly...

304
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,202
Oh, my God!

305
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:41,570
What?

306
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,542
Can you stay here tonight?

307
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:58,954
It's kind of unsettling
to think that the message

308
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:00,822
is still going to be
underneath this paint.

309
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:05,727
Like, I'm not getting rid of it,
it's, it's still here.

310
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,351
Hey, do we have
a bigger paintbrush?

311
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:53,708
I'm scared.

312
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:01,017
I'm scared too.

313
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,426
- What was that?
- Shh.

314
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,364
What's that?

315
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:17,133
- Ah, jeez, what the fuck?
- What?

316
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,901
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, wh... what was it?

317
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:23,039
- There is a person.
- What? Graham, just go check please.

318
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:27,642
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

319
00:18:58,807 --> 00:18:59,741
Oh, fuck!

320
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,247
I've not been through there.

321
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:20,695
Fuck.

322
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,839
What the fuck?

323
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,845
What the fuck?

324
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,421
<i>Graham lived on the third floor.</i>

325
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,025
<i>The front door was
locked from the inside.</i>

326
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:32,301
<i>That video made a believer
out of a lot of people.</i>

327
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,340
People that were unsure before.

328
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:47,016
Erin, I think
we need professional help.

329
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,518
And I've got someone in mind.

330
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,427
This, this is ghost hunting.

331
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:03,032
So, I've got 120,000
YouTube subscribers.

332
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,535
I'm getting a lot of vibes
from different areas,

333
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,938
all sorts here, there's a lot of ghosts here,
there's a lot of people been killed here.

334
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:11,374
Nine million views.

335
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:14,043
We managed to capture
it on film, we got it.

336
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:17,480
This is very good evidence.

337
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:19,248
One at a time, you go first.

338
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,588
I've got 10,000 Insta followers.

339
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:26,988
Look at that, somebody's...

340
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,091
tried to...

341
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,461
make this seem...

342
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:35,598
a benign place by putting
a smiley face here, but...

343
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,967
it's far from benign.

344
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,070
That's obviously not a ghost.

345
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:44,040
Oh, I've got a lot
of Twitter fans.

346
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:46,841
A lot, we're talking
10,000, 12,000.

347
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,211
Did you hear that?

348
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:54,983
We got it.

349
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:58,254
Doing, doing all right.

350
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:01,090
And I was a big deal
even before Graham

351
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,058
started out.

352
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:10,566
So during the 1920s, this place
was rumored to have a contagion

353
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,535
which led to mass hysteria,

354
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:14,537
that's why it's
shut down just now.

355
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,472
Local legend now says,

356
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:18,674
"Don't even bring
your dogs here,

357
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,276
if you let them off the lead,

358
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,844
they come in as if something's
drawing them in."

359
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:26,948
And the dogs
are never seen again.

360
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:31,087
Although I can see them.

361
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:39,095
Tell me you got that.

362
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:48,571
Be calm, Stuart.

363
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:54,876
We need to cut the last part.

364
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,688
Basically, right,
obviously I've seen

365
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:07,556
a lot of paranormal
activity in my time.

366
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,558
But Graham's videos
were a little bit...

367
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,028
on the nose.

368
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:16,065
I mean, as a ghost hunter,
you're talking about

369
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:18,334
if you hear a sound
or a spirit orb even,

370
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,169
you, you're getting lucky.

371
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:21,704
So...

372
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:24,273
Graham's videos were
a little bit more

373
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,341
sensational.

374
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:27,676
Dubious...

375
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:30,012
one might say.

376
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:35,317
Steve, Steve annoyed
the fuck out of me.

377
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:37,420
Oh, man, um,

378
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:39,054
he thought he was a big deal.

379
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:42,957
No, sorry, 15,000
Instagram followers now, so.

380
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:45,561
And to be honest, if Graham
hadn't had those two viral videos,

381
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:48,364
I don't think he even
would have messaged us.

382
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:51,066
He's, uh,
he's pretty up himself.

383
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,036
But, you know, Graham insisted.

384
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,607
You know, he'd been
a fan of his for years.

385
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:03,612
And I guess it was good
to have someone with a bit of

386
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:07,082
"experience."

387
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,786
He was freaking out. He didn't understand
what he was dealing with, right?

388
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,521
I've been around
the block before though.

389
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:16,258
So, you know, I was happy
to hear him out, I wanted to,

390
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,726
to hear his experience.

391
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:20,596
Okay.

392
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:23,599
- Steve. Nice to meet you, thanks for coming out.
- Graham.

393
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:26,435
- No worries.
- I thought we could film this for posterity.

394
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:29,472
Well, I like where
your head's at and,

395
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,307
it's good to meet you and Erin.

396
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,475
Hey.

397
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:34,577
Yeah, no worries.

398
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,645
Oh, have a seat, by the way.

399
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,113
Uh, okay.

400
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:39,715
Um, do you like my house?

401
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,019
- You grew up in places like this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

402
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:46,489
So, yeah, I mean,

403
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:48,491
you've seen the videos, right?

404
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:51,160
- The ones...
- Yeah, they're good, they're good, they're promising.

405
00:24:51,193 --> 00:24:53,829
So do you think there's
something paranormal

406
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:55,331
going on in our flat?

407
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:57,766
I mean, we've watched
it a lot, uh.

408
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,069
There's something
definitely weird going on.

409
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:02,204
Right, I've been doing
this job for ten years,

410
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:04,740
I've never seen anything
quite like that.

411
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:08,143
That's what we thought as well.

412
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:11,313
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely
something going on.

413
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:14,183
Well, I guess
the bottom line is, um...

414
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:18,354
do you think you would,
you know,

415
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:20,556
be able to help us
investigate it?

416
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,425
Maybe collaborate
on some videos?

417
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,060
Do some cross promotion
sort of stuff.

418
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:26,495
Graham, definitely.

419
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:30,566
Listen, I don't think
there's a bigger priority

420
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,434
in the paranormal world
than figuring out

421
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,570
what's in your flat right now.

422
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,872
It's, it's weird.

423
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:38,607
Yeah, I didn't realize
what a relief

424
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:41,110
that would be to hear
until I actually heard it.

425
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:42,378
Mate, no problem, man.

426
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:44,179
Great.

427
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:45,614
We'll get to the bottom of this.

428
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:47,349
- Thanks.
- We'll find the truth.

429
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:48,684
Which we always do.

430
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,786
Let's hunt some
motherfucking ghosts.

431
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:54,456
That was a bit too far,
but okay.

432
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:17,546
Listen,
I can tell you right now...

433
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,617
that thing in your flat,
whatever it is,

434
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,252
that's a money making machine.

435
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,488
You just need a bit
of business savvy about it,

436
00:26:26,522 --> 00:26:27,790
I can provide that.

437
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,327
Honestly, we'll be making some

438
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,563
seriously fucking
hard cash that way.

439
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:35,664
That's a little bit crass,

440
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:36,599
but I have been saying that

441
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:38,133
to Graham for weeks now.

442
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:42,338
I mean, I definitely want that.

443
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:44,406
But we're going to uncover
the truth of it

444
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,308
along the way, right?

445
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:47,710
Aye, right, of course, you know,

446
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:50,779
paranormal investigating
is for life, man, but,

447
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:54,249
you know,
"hashtag fucking fake news."

448
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:56,685
You know what I mean?
The audience are into clickbait,

449
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,887
spectacle, and shaming people.

450
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,823
We can provide the first two,

451
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:02,725
if the truth is revealed
along the way,

452
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:04,126
that's just a bonus, right?

453
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:07,896
Oh, shit,
your mic's still on, hold on.

454
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,365
Oh, get it off me.

455
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:12,434
<i>If the truth
is revealed along the way,</i>

456
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:13,636
<i>that's just a bonus, right?</i>

457
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:17,640
<i>Oh, shit,
your mic's still on, hold on.</i>

458
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:18,841
<i>Oh, get it off me.</i>

459
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:22,778
Listen.

460
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:26,415
My work speaks for itself, okay?

461
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:30,219
Secondly, in regards to

462
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:31,787
what I said about

463
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,422
your average internet user...

464
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:36,859
everything after
what happened with Graham

465
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:38,894
and this whole mess,

466
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:41,730
can you really say that

467
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:44,600
I'm not justified
in what I said?

468
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:50,239
Was what I said wrong,
after everything that Graham went through?

469
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,811
That's what I make of that.

470
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:03,519
So, that was the start
of our work with Steve.

471
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:07,189
And his first suggestion
was really out there.

472
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:11,794
He suggested...

473
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:15,264
Seance.

474
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:19,568
First ever 360 degree
live streamed seance,

475
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:20,869
never been done before.

476
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:23,305
So, if Graham and Erin's place

477
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:25,641
was really a hotbed
of paranormal activity,

478
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:29,311
we're talking internet gold.

479
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:30,979
Right?
That's what we're talking.

480
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,582
And even I underestimated it.

481
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:37,020
Which was unfortunate
for Graham.

482
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:41,623
Yeah, kind of backfired on him.

483
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:08,051
- Right.
- Okay,

484
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,452
okay, yeah.

485
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:13,822
And camera's on.

486
00:29:15,891 --> 00:29:18,694
Have we got enough
candles now, Steve?

487
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:22,898
Um, no, I don't, actually.

488
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:28,004
Okay, is everyone ready to go?

489
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,571
- Yup.
- I'm ready.

490
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:32,808
Uh, once I hit live,
that's it, we're live.

491
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:35,811
Ready? Yeah, okay.

492
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:39,681
And we're live, hello,
fellow followers.

493
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:42,518
Uh, I'm doing a conjoined stream
here with special guest,

494
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,521
uh, special guest
Graham and Erin.

495
00:29:45,554 --> 00:29:50,526
And this is the first ever
VR live streamed seance.

496
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:56,532
That's right,
we have our 360 degree VR camera

497
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,767
in the middle of the room,
which means it captures

498
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:01,370
all 360 degrees of this room,

499
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,072
so if anything spooky

500
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:05,674
or paranormal happens,

501
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:07,609
this camera will see it.

502
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:11,446
Exactly, so, if you like
this video, please like it.

503
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,050
Subscribe or comment,
we're on Instagram,

504
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,785
we're on Twitter,
we're on YouTube.

505
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:18,954
Okay, now that's out of the way,
we can seance it up.

506
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:21,456
- And, uh...
- Seance it up.

507
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,925
Yes, it's a Victorian saying.

508
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,961
- Sorry.
- Right. Okay.

509
00:30:25,994 --> 00:30:28,630
So, yep, Steve,
you're the expert,

510
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:30,465
do you want
to walk us through this

511
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:32,101
- lovely set up we have here?
- Yes.

512
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:34,736
So basically,
we've got a lot of candles,

513
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,906
it's almost midnight,
we've got a quiet room.

514
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,509
Uh, these are all good
prerequisites.

515
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,910
Uh, phones are off?

516
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:43,378
- Yes.
- Yep.

517
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:44,413
- Phone's off.
- Okay, great.

518
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:45,480
And Steve, can you tell us a bit

519
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:47,016
about why we're using whisky?

520
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,450
No.

521
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:50,819
That'll be explained later.

522
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:56,159
Okay, so, now, all we need to do

523
00:30:57,093 --> 00:30:59,394
is... well, first off,

524
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:01,064
get your hands
on the table please.

525
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:03,932
This grounds us
to the physical realm.

526
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:09,038
I'm going to read this prayer,

527
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:10,606
which is going to protect us,

528
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,441
it's hopefully going
to get the spirits...

529
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:14,643
out...

530
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:16,845
or in this room.

531
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,883
"In the name of God,
Jesus Christ...

532
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,685
the great brotherhood of light,

533
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,021
please protect us from

534
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:26,722
the forces of evil
during this session.

535
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:30,459
Let there be nothing but
light surrounding this table,

536
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:33,662
and its participants,
and let us only communicate

537
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:35,664
with powers
and entities of light.

538
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:39,835
Protect us, protect this house,

539
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:42,704
the people in this house,
and let there only be light

540
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:45,041
and nothing but light, amen."

541
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:57,786
So spirit, if you're here,
please let us know.

542
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:04,127
Is something supposed to happen?

543
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:07,930
I'm hoping, uh...

544
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:14,003
Spirit, if you're here,
please, please, let us know.

545
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:15,138
Use the whisky.

546
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,777
Should we maybe...

547
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:25,714
Did someone push the table?

548
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:27,482
No.

549
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:32,654
Okay.

550
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:34,489
Oh, my God.

551
00:32:34,523 --> 00:32:37,260
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck!

552
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,461
Sit down,
don't break the circle.

553
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:50,039
That's... incredible.

554
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:53,775
Okay, spirit,
who are we speaking to?

555
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,580
- Fuck.
- Jesus.

556
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:05,687
What's it doing,
why's it coming?

557
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:28,710
Fuck!

558
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:30,246
Oh, my God!

559
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:40,856
You guys saw that, right?

560
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:41,790
Yeah.

561
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:50,999
I assumed there'd been some
sort of trickery, something,

562
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:52,567
he'd managed
to work something out

563
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:53,802
that he thought was quite good,

564
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:56,172
but, um,
I couldn't figure it out.

565
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,209
Well, the reaction
was even bigger

566
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:02,544
than all of the other
videos put together.

567
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:05,981
I had to call him straight away,
it was just crazy.

568
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:09,785
I think people just
wanted confirmation.

569
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:13,322
And they got it.

570
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:14,890
Did you see this video?

571
00:34:14,923 --> 00:34:17,793
This is completely fucked up.

572
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:23,399
Well, I underestimated it.

573
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:26,369
Genuinely had trouble
sleeping last night.

574
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:29,838
Who is this guy? That ghost's
some scary ass shit, boy.

575
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:35,378
Well, it was by far
my most successful video,

576
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:37,579
um, even to this day, um.

577
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,715
It was the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

578
00:34:42,118 --> 00:34:43,785
I thought.

579
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:46,222
Well, I mean,
the fact that anyone

580
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,957
over the age of five thought
these hauntings were real,

581
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,727
um, just sums up what's
wrong with society today.

582
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:00,702
It was clearly just three people
making short horror films,

583
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,737
and I've got
nothing against horror,

584
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:05,841
but the fact that they were
presenting it as real,

585
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:08,877
manipulating people,
taking them in,

586
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,912
there were some people
that really bought it,

587
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:12,315
and it really hurt them.

588
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:16,219
I, I've got some comments
on some of their videos.

589
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,055
Right, here.

590
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:26,661
Okay. "This is amazing,
I always suspected,

591
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:28,663
my husband passed
away three years ago,

592
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:30,699
can you help me get in touch?"

593
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:33,402
This one, "Graham, Steve, Erin,

594
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:35,271
thanks for showing
everyone the truth,

595
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:37,039
now I can talk
to my dead grandparents

596
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:39,275
at night knowing I'm not crazy."

597
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,344
I mean,
they weren't helping anyone.

598
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:44,113
Look at this one, uh,

599
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,315
"Please, please,
help me talk to my mom,

600
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:48,884
she passed in April,
I know you can help me,

601
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,353
please respond to my messages."

602
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:52,355
That one really breaks my heart.

603
00:35:55,824 --> 00:35:58,394
It really got on my nerves,
to be honest.

604
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:02,831
Um, I sort of developed
a bit of a grudge against them.

605
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:06,435
I really wanted to just
prove them and...

606
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,106
Do you know what,
I can show you.

607
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:20,815
Hi, sorry, you're early,
just come through.

608
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,818
Um, you can set up in there.

609
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,987
Uh, make yourselves comfortable.

610
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:01,424
It's pretty tacky, right?

611
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:02,991
What is it?

612
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:05,228
It's a souvenir from
my first big debunk case.

613
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,064
What happened?

614
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:11,200
Well, these newlyweds
had moved into a new flat,

615
00:37:11,234 --> 00:37:13,469
and they found
this doll in the attic.

616
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:15,338
Understandably,
they found it a bit creepy,

617
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:16,539
so they left it there.

618
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:21,043
After a while, they started
to hear strange noises,

619
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:22,578
scratching, scraping,

620
00:37:22,612 --> 00:37:26,082
sort of sounded like
little feet in the attic, um.

621
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:28,984
Then things
got even weirder, because

622
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:32,321
they started to find the doll
in random places in the flat.

623
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:35,458
Uh, it would show up in
cupboards, washing up baskets,

624
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:38,027
and both of them insisted
they weren't moving it.

625
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:40,496
So how did you get involved?

626
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:42,897
Well, they recorded the case,

627
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,534
and uploaded the videos,
um, like Graham's,

628
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:49,071
and when I saw them,
I just wanted

629
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:51,173
to get to the bottom of it, so,

630
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:56,012
did some digging,
and I figured it out,

631
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:57,912
it was the dog walker.

632
00:37:57,946 --> 00:38:01,250
The dog walker had also seen
some of their initial videos,

633
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,952
and thought it was a great
chance to fuck with them.

634
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,221
So whenever they were out,

635
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:06,489
the dog walker would
move the doll

636
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:08,190
to different places.

637
00:38:09,058 --> 00:38:11,027
So, once I figured it out,
of course,

638
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,295
they fired the dog walker.

639
00:38:13,296 --> 00:38:15,298
And that was it, that simple.

640
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:16,599
And what about the sounds?

641
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:17,866
It's just rats.

642
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:19,502
There's always an explanation.

643
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:25,974
That said, um,
they still didn't 100% believe

644
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:28,877
that the doll
was just a harmless doll.

645
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,281
Uh, so they asked me
to take it off their hands,

646
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:34,350
and now I keep it
on my mantelpiece,

647
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:36,252
like my own little
personal Annabelle.

648
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,355
Anyways, come and look at this,

649
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:42,924
this is the footage
that I had ready for you.

650
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:46,429
Okay, um, so you have to look
pretty carefully here.

651
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:48,230
Watch the mug, okay?

652
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:51,933
There, okay?

653
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:53,502
Did you see that?

654
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:55,004
There, can you see it?

655
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:00,476
<i>Erin?</i>

656
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,244
There. Did you get that?

657
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,587
It's a wire.

658
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,123
Which means that
this wasn't shot live at all.

659
00:39:15,224 --> 00:39:18,094
So if that was faked,
what else was?

660
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:23,932
Things keep
falling off that shelf.

661
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,702
I like to joke that
the doll doesn't really like

662
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,870
sharing the space
with other ornaments.

663
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:33,109
Am I being stupid, or has
that doll moved since we've been here?

664
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,579
I don't think so.

665
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:37,912
It's just a doll.

666
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,359
I don't know if the mic's
picking that up, can you hear that?

667
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:02,971
I think it stopped.

668
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,108
Jesus Christ.

669
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:09,944
I'm sorry, guys,
I couldn't help myself.

670
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:11,614
Just wanted to make a point.

671
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:14,316
You see, it's really easy
to fake stuff like this.

672
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:16,652
The doll's remote controlled.

673
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,422
I've got a speaker
on the mantelpiece,

674
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:24,059
and I also included a little
mechanism that pushes her off.

675
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:26,295
It's so easy to fool people,

676
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:28,431
and that's why I wanted to

677
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:31,233
show everyone what people
like Graham are doing.

678
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:34,136
So was the story
about the dog walkers true?

679
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:36,005
No.

680
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:44,747
I think I've got it.

681
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,282
<i>Steve and Graham agreed</i>

682
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:47,750
<i>to have a meeting with me.</i>

683
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:49,285
<i>I told them
I wanted to write a piece</i>

684
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:50,753
<i>promoting their work.</i>

685
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:54,023
Of course, they believed me,
their big egos.

686
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:55,691
Yeah, what was
that reporter lady's name?

687
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:57,126
Alice Harper.

688
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,427
Yeah, Alice Harper,
right, so anyway,

689
00:40:58,461 --> 00:41:00,529
she's wanting
an interview with Graham.

690
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:03,732
She's into debunking
paranormal investigators,

691
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:06,168
internet fraudsters,
that's her business.

692
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:09,171
So, obviously she's going
to try and, you know,

693
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:10,706
debunk us, even though you can't

694
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:13,442
debunk somebody who's legit,
who's, uh,

695
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:16,479
unbunked, so, you know,
I don't know why.

696
00:41:16,512 --> 00:41:18,514
But anyway, I told Graham,

697
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:19,815
"Let's do this,

698
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:22,318
we'll fucking beat her
at her own game."

699
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,124
<i>I took an improvised
little spy camera to our meeting.</i>

700
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:32,761
<i>I cut a hole in a pencil case,
lined the camera up.</i>

701
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:35,764
<i>I got my pal Kevin
to do some second camera work,</i>

702
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:38,067
<i>just in case I couldn't
get a good enough view.</i>

703
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,704
What I didn't count on, which,

704
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:43,772
in hindsight should have
been fucking obvious,

705
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:46,775
is that Graham and Steve
planned on doing

706
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,511
a little bit
of filming of their own.

707
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,066
Do you guys mind if I take
some notes while we do this?

708
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,069
No, as long as you don't mind
us filming the interview.

709
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:15,571
No, fire away, okay.

710
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:17,506
Uh, so...

711
00:42:18,774 --> 00:42:20,175
It was fucking mind games,

712
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,211
they were trying
to throw me off.

713
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:25,214
Graham, what do you make
of these allegations

714
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:29,518
that you, Erin, and Steve have
been faking these hauntings?

715
00:42:29,552 --> 00:42:31,120
- Well...
- Preposterous.

716
00:42:31,153 --> 00:42:33,422
Thanks Steve,
I was actually asking Graham.

717
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:35,157
Yeah, Steve, it's okay.

718
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,726
I mean, this footage,
if it's genuine,

719
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,463
is perhaps one of the most
amazing things I've ever seen.

720
00:42:41,497 --> 00:42:43,365
- Thank you.
- Earth shattering,

721
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:45,768
some might say
it beggars belief.

722
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:48,837
Well, sometimes
I wish it wasn't true.

723
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:50,606
You know, a lot of people
don't realize

724
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,676
that this has been more
of a curse than anything else.

725
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:56,545
Yeah, well, sometimes when
people find fame and fortune,

726
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,547
they realize it's not
everything they wanted.

727
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,383
You know that's
not what I meant.

728
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,454
Look, I've been researching you,

729
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:08,657
and you weren't always into
this ghost hunting shit,

730
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:09,925
or whatever you want to call it.

731
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:12,795
We're paranormal investigators

732
00:43:12,828 --> 00:43:15,264
and extra-dimensional experts.

733
00:43:15,297 --> 00:43:17,166
That's what we are,
you need to do some research

734
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,601
before you start interviewing,

735
00:43:18,634 --> 00:43:20,669
- just a thought...
- Thank you, thank you, Steve.

736
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,637
Okay.

737
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:24,173
You've tried every trend going,

738
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:25,841
I've even seen
your planking videos.

739
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:29,411
Did you like them?

740
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:33,182
This is what I think's happened.

741
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,884
You played a prank,

742
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,154
it was successful,
it went viral.

743
00:43:39,188 --> 00:43:40,289
You liked how it felt,

744
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:41,857
and that's why you got involved

745
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:45,227
with this two-bit
"quasi-celebrity" over here.

746
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,595
Now wait a minute.

747
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:48,330
I've got a question.

748
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:51,367
Why did you use air quotes
when you said celebrity?

749
00:43:54,236 --> 00:43:56,438
Have either of you guys looked
into an internet shaming?

750
00:43:58,008 --> 00:44:01,210
Because, you know,
if you are faking this,

751
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:03,345
then you've got a massive
shaming coming your way,

752
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,347
and it is not going
to be pretty.

753
00:44:08,217 --> 00:44:09,752
This is your interview?

754
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:13,222
You, you're just telling
us things.

755
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:14,556
Plus you're not
writing anything down,

756
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,992
I told you what exactly
our jobs are,

757
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:18,460
you didn't write that down.

758
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:19,495
That's okay, Steve, I think

759
00:44:19,528 --> 00:44:20,963
I've got everything I need.

760
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:22,297
I'm going to get the bill.

761
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,308
I have read up on shamings, man,

762
00:44:33,342 --> 00:44:35,611
and they are fucking brutal.

763
00:44:35,644 --> 00:44:38,981
Right, don't worry
about that, okay?

764
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:41,784
- Yeah, but what if they...
- Don't worry about it, okay?

765
00:44:41,817 --> 00:44:44,920
Just, we've got a good
thing going on here, just chill.

766
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:46,989
Yeah, but if they fucking find
out we've been faking it,

767
00:44:47,023 --> 00:44:48,924
then we're going
to be in so much shit.

768
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,531
That was...

769
00:44:57,399 --> 00:45:00,736
probably the most satisfying
moment of my career.

770
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:02,805
I mean...

771
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:06,942
I uploaded the video that night,

772
00:45:06,975 --> 00:45:09,478
and got a little
viral fame of my own.

773
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:11,246
Don't worry about it, okay?

774
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,316
Just, we've got a good thing
going on here, just chill.

775
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:16,418
Yeah, but if they fucking find
out we've been faking it,

776
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:17,986
then we're going
to be in so much shit.

777
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,830
Ha, whoops,
he didn't see that one coming.

778
00:45:27,863 --> 00:45:30,066
I feel so betrayed.

779
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,734
Graham deserved his comeuppance.

780
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:33,036
He's shitting himself.

781
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:34,670
He looks more scared now
than he did

782
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:36,072
when he thought
he'd seen a ghost.

783
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:37,806
Graham...

784
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,909
went off on a massive
spiral at that point.

785
00:45:40,943 --> 00:45:42,444
Just go kill yourself.

786
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:44,313
You guys,
this is from the heart...

787
00:45:45,314 --> 00:45:47,549
I really thought that
for once there was proof,

788
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,485
you have no idea what
that meant to me.

789
00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:51,754
Steve got off okay.

790
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:54,423
No backlash for me,
no backlash for me.

791
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:57,926
I wasn't in the spotlight
as much, so.

792
00:45:59,095 --> 00:46:01,030
All my followers,

793
00:46:01,064 --> 00:46:04,366
they know my work
is 100% authentic.

794
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:05,868
He was asking for it.

795
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,470
I can't believe I didn't
do it sooner, to be honest.

796
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:11,573
They knew that I was just
getting tied into some kind of

797
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:12,808
dubious stuff.

798
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:14,710
<i>I mean...</i>

799
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:17,479
<i>the insults,</i>

800
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:20,816
<i>criticisms, death threats.</i>

801
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:22,551
He got to experience
what it was like

802
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:25,754
to be a woman online,
for a minute.

803
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:27,790
I mean, for God's sakes,

804
00:46:27,823 --> 00:46:30,093
I got death threats,
rape threats,

805
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:31,627
for writing an article
on cheesecake,

806
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,362
you don't see me
crying about it.

807
00:46:34,563 --> 00:46:36,465
Steve left him out to dry.

808
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:39,635
It's funny, all the focus
seemed to be on Graham...

809
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:42,938
I mean, I guess he was
the instigator, but...

810
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:45,974
I was lucky.

811
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,544
I don't really have
an online presence,

812
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:50,579
I was only in a few
of the videos, so.

813
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:53,482
And you knew
it was faked from the start?

814
00:46:55,984 --> 00:46:56,885
Mm-hm.

815
00:46:59,055 --> 00:47:02,125
I see it like all of Graham's
videos, it's an art piece.

816
00:47:02,158 --> 00:47:05,394
It's challenging people
about what they think is real,

817
00:47:05,427 --> 00:47:06,962
and what they think is not real.

818
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,632
And you don't
think that's problematic?

819
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,370
No.

820
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:18,440
I'm glad we did it.

821
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:19,842
I'm really sad to see it end.

822
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:24,446
That's what I told them...

823
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:27,083
<i>The fallout for
Graham was terrible.</i>

824
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:28,617
...fireworks and stuff.

825
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,119
<i>He just became
a different person</i>

826
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:31,221
<i>at that point, I mean...</i>

827
00:47:32,554 --> 00:47:34,890
<i>The things that people
would say to him,</i>

828
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:37,126
<i>they'd say to him online.</i>

829
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,427
Fuck.

830
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:41,563
Can you stop filming?

831
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:45,434
Please.

832
00:47:47,036 --> 00:47:48,637
And then came the apology.

833
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:52,808
Graham had been reading a book
about public shaming,

834
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:55,178
and in the book the person
had apologized,

835
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:57,980
and everyone accepted
the apology,

836
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:00,149
and everything was fine again.

837
00:48:00,183 --> 00:48:02,517
So Graham thought
he would do the same.

838
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:04,620
Even though I said to him,
"Just let it blow over."

839
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:07,789
But Graham is very
single minded.

840
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:09,192
And he did it anyway.

841
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:20,636
As most of you know,
it was revealed last week

842
00:48:20,669 --> 00:48:22,738
that the recent spate
of hauntings that were

843
00:48:22,771 --> 00:48:25,241
recorded and documented
in this flat

844
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:26,909
were faked by myself,

845
00:48:26,942 --> 00:48:28,177
with the help of some others.

846
00:48:29,945 --> 00:48:32,781
I want to apologize from
the bottom of my heart

847
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:33,982
for misleading all of you.

848
00:48:36,252 --> 00:48:38,487
I understand that some of you
were questioning your faith

849
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,189
because of these videos,

850
00:48:40,223 --> 00:48:42,225
and for that, I am truly sorry.

851
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:49,665
It got out of hand.

852
00:48:49,698 --> 00:48:52,001
The moment got away from me,

853
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:54,103
and I was encouraged
by those closest to me.

854
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:59,975
It was never my intention
to hurt any of you.

855
00:49:01,277 --> 00:49:02,844
I only wanted to entertain.

856
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:06,448
And I guess I failed.

857
00:49:09,052 --> 00:49:11,787
I just hope we can all
move on from this...

858
00:49:13,222 --> 00:49:14,656
and forget about this blip.

859
00:49:16,558 --> 00:49:17,826
I'm truly sorry.

860
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:23,299
Okay, well, there's
a few things wrong there.

861
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,867
First off, terrible apology.

862
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:28,271
"I was encouraged
by those closest to me?"

863
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:31,940
Why should he throw Erin
under the bus?

864
00:49:31,974 --> 00:49:35,011
He also tries to shift
the blame off himself.

865
00:49:35,044 --> 00:49:36,645
"I just wanted to entertain,

866
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:38,047
and the moment
got away from me."

867
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:40,615
Just admit that you lied
and go from there.

868
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:42,051
None of this half-assed shit.

869
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,521
When people found out that
he'd monetized the video...

870
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,626
...that was some
major <i>schadenfreude.</i>

871
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,031
And it was
like the internet shaming

872
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:56,932
had started all over again.

873
00:49:58,334 --> 00:49:59,735
And then...

874
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:03,572
I properly lost it over this...

875
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:06,242
another ghost.

876
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:11,713
<i>Well, the first thing was
the figure in the background.</i>

877
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:14,816
<i>What was he thinking?</i>

878
00:50:19,255 --> 00:50:20,722
<i>And then there was the picture,</i>

879
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:22,225
<i>and this was so subtle</i>

880
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:23,892
<i>that I wondered why
it was done at all.</i>

881
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:26,295
<i>I really don't get
his thinking on it.</i>

882
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,066
<i>It wasn't really noticeable
at normal speed,</i>

883
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:32,201
<i>but if you sped the video up.</i>

884
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:43,945
I just don't get why he did it.

885
00:51:52,148 --> 00:51:54,083
And did you believe him?

886
00:51:57,886 --> 00:51:58,987
I do now.

887
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:05,094
So if you could just
tell us your name, occupation,

888
00:52:05,128 --> 00:52:08,231
and spell it, so we have it for
the onscreen graphics, please.

889
00:52:08,264 --> 00:52:11,467
Yeah, okay,
it's Doctor John Watson.

890
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:12,968
I know, hold the jokes.

891
00:52:14,003 --> 00:52:17,340
It's J-O-H-N, W-A-T-S-O-N.

892
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:19,641
And I'm a social psychologist.

893
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:22,844
Would you like me to spell that?

894
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:26,415
Yeah, so it's been well
documented that...

895
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,418
social media is addictive.

896
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:31,087
I think we all know that.

897
00:52:35,124 --> 00:52:40,263
<i>When you get a notification,
that little red dot appears,</i>

898
00:52:40,296 --> 00:52:42,697
<i>or your phone buzzes
in your pocket,</i>

899
00:52:43,466 --> 00:52:47,736
<i>that sends a little micro dosage
of dopamine to your brain.</i>

900
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:52,108
It says, "Oh, this is good."

901
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:55,111
<i>And in the same
way that a drug addict,</i>

902
00:52:55,144 --> 00:52:58,780
<i>sex addicts, gamblers,
or any form of addiction,</i>

903
00:52:58,813 --> 00:53:01,417
<i>the same happens
to the social media addict.</i>

904
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:04,786
<i>I've found that the more
exposure, the worse it gets.</i>

905
00:53:06,522 --> 00:53:08,090
<i>Take someone like Graham,</i>

906
00:53:08,124 --> 00:53:10,992
<i>you know, he was getting dozens,
if not hundreds</i>

907
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:12,994
<i>of notifications a day;</i>

908
00:53:13,029 --> 00:53:17,266
<i>comments, likes,
subscribers, views even.</i>

909
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,137
<i>Each one a little parcel
of dopamine right to the brain.</i>

910
00:53:22,837 --> 00:53:26,542
<i>Now, what hasn't been explored
is what happens</i>

911
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:29,478
<i>when the trigger that gives
you that little dopamine shot</i>

912
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:31,214
<i>becomes a negative stimulus.</i>

913
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:34,783
<i>Imagine, for example,
a heroin addict.</i>

914
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:38,554
<i>Getting their buzz as normal,
and then all of a sudden,</i>

915
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:42,724
<i>the object of their addiction,
heroin, makes them feel bad.</i>

916
00:53:43,526 --> 00:53:46,195
<i>Every time they inject,
it's a negative experience.</i>

917
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:53,369
<i>But the issue is,
they still crave it.</i>

918
00:53:53,402 --> 00:53:54,903
<i>They're addicted to it,</i>

919
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:57,173
<i>and they can't stop
taking the drug.</i>

920
00:53:57,206 --> 00:53:59,408
<i>Well, the dopamine hit
is still the same,</i>

921
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:01,477
<i>but the emotions
are all negative.</i>

922
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:03,079
<i>But now instead
of making them happy,</i>

923
00:54:03,112 --> 00:54:05,181
<i>it becomes an oppressive,</i>

924
00:54:05,214 --> 00:54:07,782
<i>antagonistic force
in their lives.</i>

925
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:10,386
<i>When they don't have it,
they crave it, and when</i>

926
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:13,089
<i>they get it, it's
a deeply negative experience.</i>

927
00:54:14,557 --> 00:54:17,426
That was the world that
Graham was living in.

928
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,828
You know,
he craved social media.

929
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:22,831
When he did get fulfillment,
at best,

930
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:25,034
it was someone telling
him he sucked,

931
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:27,969
and at worst it was someone
telling him to kill himself.

932
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:30,506
It's no wonder he fell apart.

933
00:54:36,279 --> 00:54:38,947
I don't know
if I'll post this one.

934
00:54:39,848 --> 00:54:41,883
Just finding it easier
to talk to

935
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,519
the camera than
a person right now.

936
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:47,023
I really fucked up.

937
00:54:48,957 --> 00:54:51,394
I don't know why,
why we let it go so long.

938
00:54:56,365 --> 00:54:57,600
Steve's abandoned me.

939
00:54:59,302 --> 00:55:00,935
Haven't seen Erin in a few days.

940
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:05,441
And the abuse from online
is just getting worse.

941
00:55:09,045 --> 00:55:10,945
Things in here have
been weird as well.

942
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:13,082
Still weird shit going on.

943
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,352
Just finding things out
of place...

944
00:55:17,952 --> 00:55:19,188
things moving around...

945
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:21,657
noises.

946
00:55:23,526 --> 00:55:25,594
Wonder if
someone's broken in, or

947
00:55:25,628 --> 00:55:27,363
maybe they saw
where I live online.

948
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:29,898
Fuck knows.

949
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:22,551
Oh, my God!

950
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:32,161
Welcome to the show.

951
00:56:32,194 --> 00:56:33,928
Back after a short break,

952
00:56:33,962 --> 00:56:35,698
I have very good
news for Graham.

953
00:56:35,731 --> 00:56:38,401
I believe
the hauntings were real.

954
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:41,404
And I have proof.

955
00:56:41,437 --> 00:56:43,406
Now what we had before
wasn't strictly paranormal,

956
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:46,742
that's fine, but
I've re-looked at the footage,

957
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:50,446
and I believe there's
more to this whole story

958
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:51,547
than meets the eye.

959
00:56:53,982 --> 00:56:55,217
This is Graham's flat,

960
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:56,585
I think he'll be
very happy to see us.

961
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:01,090
Hey, Graham.

962
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:07,263
Still a little bit
down in the dumps.

963
00:57:07,296 --> 00:57:08,197
Maybe.

964
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:13,068
Graham, Graham, buddy.

965
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,238
Listen, I do have
something very important

966
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:18,040
to show you man,
I think it'll cheer you up.

967
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:26,482
Graham, please,
open the door, trust me, man.

968
00:57:29,752 --> 00:57:32,354
Well, fortunately,
I actually have a set of keys

969
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:33,789
that Graham gave me
whilst we were

970
00:57:33,823 --> 00:57:35,224
in the thick
of our investigations,

971
00:57:35,257 --> 00:57:36,991
which,
wouldn't normally advocate

972
00:57:37,026 --> 00:57:38,227
breaking into
anyone's house, but

973
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,129
he's mentally unstable, so,

974
00:57:40,162 --> 00:57:43,032
you know,
we've got to help him out.

975
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,568
Graham, we're here to help.

976
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:47,203
Steve, what the fuck?

977
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:48,437
Get out of my flat,
I don't want to talk to you.

978
00:57:48,471 --> 00:57:50,172
Right, just calm down,
all right?

979
00:57:50,206 --> 00:57:51,740
Trust me, you need to see this.

980
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:53,309
Oh, trust you, yeah,
worked out well

981
00:57:53,342 --> 00:57:55,110
last time I did that, didn't it?

982
00:57:55,144 --> 00:57:56,412
Jesus.

983
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:58,614
You know, it was his idea,
faking it.

984
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:00,282
Still got your fans, I see.

985
00:58:00,316 --> 00:58:02,451
Wake up, people,
he's full of fucking bullshit.

986
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:09,291
Erin's told me you've
not been keeping well.

987
00:58:10,426 --> 00:58:11,360
Yeah, well.

988
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:15,564
She said you've been seeing
things moving about the flat.

989
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:19,735
Been talking to Erin much,
have you?

990
00:58:19,768 --> 00:58:22,705
Um, well,
I'm on your side, okay?

991
00:58:23,772 --> 00:58:25,274
Right, okay, watch this.

992
00:58:27,176 --> 00:58:31,280
I'm pretty sure that there's
real hauntings here.

993
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:34,517
No fucking shit.

994
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,285
I've been telling you
that for weeks.

995
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:38,153
Have you not been listening?

996
00:58:38,187 --> 00:58:40,589
Just because it wasn't
profitable for you?

997
00:58:40,623 --> 00:58:42,391
You know, you come here
with your crew,

998
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:45,294
just because you finally
see that there's

999
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:46,529
something in it for you.

1000
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:50,266
What, what am I doing,
just get out.

1001
00:58:50,299 --> 00:58:51,700
Wait, right, wait.

1002
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:54,136
Okay, you need to put all
that to the side, because

1003
00:58:54,169 --> 00:58:55,671
there is something bigger here,

1004
00:58:55,704 --> 00:58:57,439
we need to get to
the bottom of this.

1005
00:58:57,473 --> 00:58:59,575
Like all of earth's
wondrous mysteries,

1006
00:58:59,608 --> 00:59:03,512
there is a big, profound,
deep meaning to this, which we can...

1007
00:59:03,546 --> 00:59:06,215
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Wait, just let me finish this.

1008
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:07,650
- Which we need to excavate...
- What?

1009
00:59:07,683 --> 00:59:10,085
Steve, drop, drop the act.

1010
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:11,320
It's just you and me.

1011
00:59:11,353 --> 00:59:13,556
Just ignore the cameras,
help me out,

1012
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:15,124
like, I'm going
through something here.

1013
00:59:15,157 --> 00:59:16,525
Okay.

1014
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,693
But there is something bigger,

1015
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,194
and there is a big mystery,

1016
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:20,229
and we need to get
to the bottom of it.

1017
00:59:20,262 --> 00:59:21,330
Just fucking leave.

1018
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:27,436
Graham, let's just talk about...

1019
00:59:29,605 --> 00:59:31,607
Well, that didn't go very well.

1020
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,908
It couldn't have gone
any better, I mean,

1021
00:59:32,942 --> 00:59:35,344
we had
one million views on YouTube.

1022
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:37,646
I think we called it like,
"Shamed Ghost Hunter Freaks Out,"

1023
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,181
it did really well,

1024
00:59:39,214 --> 00:59:41,150
because he was acting
like an asshole.

1025
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,118
Which is always good on YouTube.

1026
00:59:43,152 --> 00:59:45,654
So you have
evidence of the hauntings, then?

1027
00:59:45,688 --> 00:59:46,855
Can we see that footage?

1028
00:59:48,324 --> 00:59:51,894
Well, you can, all right,
let me just explain, so,

1029
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:53,829
that footage, at that point,

1030
00:59:53,862 --> 00:59:56,131
I didn't realize
he was faking it, right?

1031
00:59:56,165 --> 01:00:00,235
So, I came to him
with the footage, thinking...

1032
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:03,906
I gave him the benefit
of the doubt, at that point.

1033
01:00:03,939 --> 01:00:05,708
You know, there was
some suspicious things,

1034
01:00:05,741 --> 01:00:08,277
there was little blurs
and sounds,

1035
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,680
and, you know, at that point,
I still thought

1036
01:00:11,714 --> 01:00:13,716
there might be
something in this.

1037
01:00:13,749 --> 01:00:15,684
Then he slammed the door
in my face, and...

1038
01:00:16,919 --> 01:00:19,521
I don't know why he persisted
in trying to make it look real.

1039
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:24,493
So...

1040
01:00:28,464 --> 01:00:30,666
So I'm struggling
to sleep tonight,

1041
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:33,235
and it's not just because
it's the 5th of November,

1042
01:00:33,268 --> 01:00:35,671
and it sounds like the
fucking Gaza strip out there.

1043
01:00:39,341 --> 01:00:42,778
I started looking up
the history of the flat.

1044
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:46,148
Seeing if there was
any clues as to like...

1045
01:00:47,683 --> 01:00:49,284
why this is happening.

1046
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:51,854
Why, why's that happening here.

1047
01:00:54,723 --> 01:00:57,593
<i>And I found this news story
from a few years ago.</i>

1048
01:00:57,626 --> 01:00:58,794
<i>Seven years ago.</i>

1049
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:02,498
<i>About this girl who used
to live in this flat.</i>

1050
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,637
<i>And she was what the Japanese
would call a "Hikikomori."</i>

1051
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:12,408
<i>So she was basically a shut-in.</i>

1052
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:15,411
<i>Sometimes the other tenants
in the building would see her</i>

1053
01:01:15,444 --> 01:01:17,413
<i>roaming the halls, or
in the stairwell or something,</i>

1054
01:01:17,446 --> 01:01:19,815
<i>but aside from that,
she never left the building.</i>

1055
01:01:21,051 --> 01:01:24,720
<i>Just got everything delivered,
did everything online.</i>

1056
01:01:24,753 --> 01:01:27,723
<i>The tenants stopped
seeing her in the halls.</i>

1057
01:01:28,924 --> 01:01:30,392
<i>And then there was a smell...</i>

1058
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,795
<i>coming from her flat.</i>

1059
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:37,866
<i>When they finally got
the police to investigate,</i>

1060
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,235
<i>there was nothing.</i>

1061
01:01:40,269 --> 01:01:41,303
<i>Nobody.</i>

1062
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:44,273
<i>The girl wasn't there.</i>

1063
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:45,674
<i>But the smell was.</i>

1064
01:01:47,776 --> 01:01:48,977
<i>They never found her.</i>

1065
01:01:51,747 --> 01:01:53,916
But that wasn't the thing
that's keeping me up.

1066
01:01:56,518 --> 01:02:00,522
I, uh, I found
this function on street view

1067
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:02,458
where you can
actually look back...

1068
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:04,727
um...

1069
01:02:06,729 --> 01:02:07,896
previous years.

1070
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,468
And I looked up this flat,

1071
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:13,702
looked up seven years ago.

1072
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:16,839
<i>And this is what I saw.</i>

1073
01:02:25,014 --> 01:02:27,549
Just...

1074
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,251
I feel like
I'm fucking losing it.

1075
01:02:41,997 --> 01:02:45,267
Well, let's go and investigate.

1076
01:02:50,439 --> 01:02:51,807
Here we go again.

1077
01:03:01,084 --> 01:03:03,086
Hello? Erin?

1078
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:07,790
If that's you I'm going
to fucking kill you.

1079
01:03:08,624 --> 01:03:09,792
Not even joking.

1080
01:03:21,403 --> 01:03:22,905
Hello?

1081
01:03:22,938 --> 01:03:23,972
Erin?

1082
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:32,447
Fuck.

1083
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:34,950
Why is it always a sheet?

1084
01:03:44,426 --> 01:03:45,828
You know what?

1085
01:03:45,861 --> 01:03:47,096
Fuck this,
I'm phoning the police,

1086
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,664
and you can hunt them,
you spooky cunt.

1087
01:04:09,518 --> 01:04:11,020
The tale behind this building

1088
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:14,090
is one of addiction,
shame, and woe.

1089
01:04:14,123 --> 01:04:16,125
McCarthy's Canal House.

1090
01:04:17,459 --> 01:04:19,028
This is where McCarthy himself

1091
01:04:19,062 --> 01:04:21,797
became an isolated,
paranoid obsessive.

1092
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,498
Where he basically boarded up...

1093
01:04:23,532 --> 01:04:25,500
- Steve.
- ...every exit and entrance.

1094
01:04:25,534 --> 01:04:27,170
Graham, how...

1095
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:32,141
It's okay, it's okay,
just keep filming.

1096
01:04:32,175 --> 01:04:33,809
Fuck, give me my keys back.

1097
01:04:33,842 --> 01:04:35,444
No, what the fuck, man?

1098
01:04:35,477 --> 01:04:37,146
- What's wrong with you?
- Give me my keys back.

1099
01:04:38,014 --> 01:04:39,514
Keys, now.

1100
01:04:40,515 --> 01:04:42,551
You just fucking
punched me in the face.

1101
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:44,020
Now why did you do that?

1102
01:04:44,053 --> 01:04:46,122
You fucking attacked me
in my flat last night.

1103
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:48,258
No, I didn't.

1104
01:04:49,491 --> 01:04:51,727
- Okay? No.
- It was you. It was you.

1105
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,795
- It was you.
- I wasn't there!

1106
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:55,664
Look, I didn't break
into your flat, man.

1107
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:57,566
Look, if it wasn't you, then.

1108
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:00,936
Just fucking give
me my keys back.

1109
01:05:03,172 --> 01:05:05,440
You're fucking losing it,
there you go.

1110
01:05:05,474 --> 01:05:07,210
Don't know why you
gave me them anyway.

1111
01:05:07,243 --> 01:05:08,877
You're losing it, man.

1112
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:10,712
Do you even know what's real
and what's not any more?

1113
01:05:10,746 --> 01:05:11,847
It's on camera.

1114
01:05:12,915 --> 01:05:14,616
That doesn't mean anything.

1115
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,984
Stay the fuck out of my flat.

1116
01:05:17,486 --> 01:05:19,421
How did you know I was
going to be here anyway?

1117
01:05:20,256 --> 01:05:22,025
You posted it on
Twitter, you fuckwit.

1118
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:24,559
All right, fair point.

1119
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:28,231
Did you get all that?

1120
01:05:28,264 --> 01:05:29,765
Get some B roll,
the wheat field.

1121
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:55,224
Back in the 70s, an artist put
on a revolutionary exhibit.

1122
01:05:55,258 --> 01:05:57,893
You know, it's one that's
always stuck with me.

1123
01:05:57,926 --> 01:05:59,962
<i>The artist stood
in the middle of the room,</i>

1124
01:05:59,995 --> 01:06:02,497
<i>and she was completely still.</i>

1125
01:06:02,531 --> 01:06:05,867
And she surrounded herself
with dozens of objects.

1126
01:06:05,901 --> 01:06:10,706
<i>A feather, a rose,
some bread, grapes,</i>

1127
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:13,309
<i>scissors, a scalpel,</i>

1128
01:06:13,343 --> 01:06:15,544
<i>a gun loaded with one bullet.</i>

1129
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,281
Well, the point
of the piece was to

1130
01:06:18,314 --> 01:06:21,683
allow people to act
how they wanted to interact.

1131
01:06:21,717 --> 01:06:25,254
She didn't intervene,
they had carte blanche.

1132
01:06:26,822 --> 01:06:28,291
She rendered herself powerless.

1133
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:31,660
And at first it was fine.

1134
01:06:31,693 --> 01:06:34,763
You know, people found
it amusing and fun.

1135
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:40,003
<i>You know, some played with the
perfume, played with the feather,</i>

1136
01:06:40,036 --> 01:06:41,737
<i>and some even gave her a kiss.</i>

1137
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:44,573
But then things turned sour.

1138
01:06:50,746 --> 01:06:53,049
Eventually, some of the audience

1139
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:55,584
intervened and saved her life.

1140
01:06:55,617 --> 01:06:59,188
Afterwards she said what
she'd learned was that

1141
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:01,357
when you leave it
up to the public,

1142
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:03,359
well, they can kill you.

1143
01:07:03,393 --> 01:07:06,828
And, this is
the kind of social contract

1144
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:09,365
we take out when
we put ourselves online.

1145
01:07:09,399 --> 01:07:13,136
You know, we open
ourselves up for abuse.

1146
01:07:13,169 --> 01:07:14,037
And...

1147
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:18,341
In a sense, we're allowing
perfect strangers

1148
01:07:18,374 --> 01:07:21,077
access to our most
intimate moments.

1149
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:25,214
And when people
are allowed anonymity,

1150
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:28,984
and permission, well, you don't
know how far they'll take it.

1151
01:07:37,726 --> 01:07:39,062
I don't know what to do.

1152
01:07:41,663 --> 01:07:43,066
I took the keys from Steve.

1153
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:46,169
But it's not changed anything.

1154
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,313
I just need
a little bit of help.

1155
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:00,982
I just need help.

1156
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:31,947
Graham, hello.

1157
01:08:32,881 --> 01:08:34,183
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1158
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:48,397
What is this?

1159
01:08:48,431 --> 01:08:49,365
Feedback.

1160
01:08:51,134 --> 01:08:52,101
What are you filming?

1161
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:57,140
Just, you know,
more evidence.

1162
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:01,977
What are you talking about?

1163
01:09:03,246 --> 01:09:05,747
You know, the haunting
that's been going on

1164
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,216
in this flat for months now?

1165
01:09:08,184 --> 01:09:10,019
That no one believes me about?

1166
01:09:10,052 --> 01:09:11,420
Okay.

1167
01:09:11,454 --> 01:09:13,456
Well, I'm a little
worried about you.

1168
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:15,091
Come on, let's just
turn off the camera.

1169
01:09:15,124 --> 01:09:16,125
No, no, no.

1170
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:24,066
Graham, this isn't real.

1171
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:26,935
We faked this.

1172
01:09:28,437 --> 01:09:31,940
So, why don't you just
come back to mine,

1173
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:35,810
relax, take it easy, yeah?

1174
01:09:37,313 --> 01:09:38,713
It was real.

1175
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:39,848
It is real.

1176
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:42,485
Graham, it wasn't real.

1177
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,688
It wasn't real, we, we faked it.

1178
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:49,858
Okay, and you need to come
back with me,

1179
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:52,528
and I need you to come
back with me, okay?

1180
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:55,198
The sounds that are
happening in this flat,

1181
01:09:55,231 --> 01:09:57,333
the things that are moving
around on their own,

1182
01:09:57,366 --> 01:09:59,302
they're real, they're real.

1183
01:09:59,335 --> 01:10:00,869
Graham, you're scaring me.

1184
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:05,341
Look, they want me to...

1185
01:10:05,374 --> 01:10:07,443
What do you want though?

1186
01:10:08,578 --> 01:10:10,946
Tell me, what do you want, okay?

1187
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:14,283
Is this important to you,
is this not important to you?

1188
01:10:14,317 --> 01:10:16,718
Am I important to you?

1189
01:10:19,589 --> 01:10:22,158
God, come on, answer me,
what do you want?

1190
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:24,327
I want you to leave.

1191
01:10:32,568 --> 01:10:33,735
Wait.

1192
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:44,046
Sorry.

1193
01:10:45,348 --> 01:10:47,550
It's fine, just.

1194
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:50,286
I'm worried about you, okay?

1195
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:52,321
I just need one more night,

1196
01:10:52,355 --> 01:10:53,389
one more night.

1197
01:10:54,956 --> 01:10:56,058
And then I'll, I'll come back.

1198
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,329
And we'll forget about all this,
just one, one more night.

1199
01:11:06,502 --> 01:11:08,037
Okay.

1200
01:11:17,513 --> 01:11:19,548
So, it's come to this.

1201
01:11:20,616 --> 01:11:21,883
The last night in the flat.

1202
01:11:23,619 --> 01:11:26,921
I mean, fuck it,
I'm just renting anyway.

1203
01:11:30,493 --> 01:11:33,962
I don't know what use there
is staying one more night.

1204
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:37,866
I don't know what I could
possibly catch on camera that

1205
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:39,468
would convince you
that hasn't already.

1206
01:11:41,037 --> 01:11:41,771
But...

1207
01:11:43,272 --> 01:11:45,174
I just feel like
I have to do this.

1208
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,221
It's two a.m.

1209
01:11:59,255 --> 01:12:02,191
Nothing to report other than
the usual bumps and whispers.

1210
01:12:02,224 --> 01:12:03,992
Usual.

1211
01:12:06,928 --> 01:12:08,963
It's weird that you
don't really hear about

1212
01:12:08,997 --> 01:12:11,467
stuff happening in places
like this, new builds.

1213
01:12:14,704 --> 01:12:18,973
Maybe it's built on an ancient
Glaswegian burial ground,

1214
01:12:19,008 --> 01:12:21,010
and they're trying
to communicate with us.

1215
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:24,613
Ouija board.

1216
01:12:38,361 --> 01:12:40,229
So, it's three a.m.

1217
01:12:42,498 --> 01:12:44,033
I don't know what
I'm still doing here.

1218
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:47,869
I think Erin was right.

1219
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:50,673
So I'm going to pack up.

1220
01:12:52,575 --> 01:12:53,542
And that's...

1221
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:16,265
Okay, fuck this.

1222
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:28,943
What...

1223
01:13:30,246 --> 01:13:31,480
the fuck?

1224
01:14:51,494 --> 01:14:53,395
What the fuck?

1225
01:15:05,574 --> 01:15:06,642
Come on.

1226
01:15:55,591 --> 01:15:59,361
Concussion, broken wrist,

1227
01:15:59,395 --> 01:16:00,763
three fractured ribs...

1228
01:16:01,864 --> 01:16:03,365
dislocated shoulder.

1229
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:08,704
<i>He survived, but it was
touch and go for a fair bit.</i>

1230
01:16:08,737 --> 01:16:11,874
I was in visiting him
in hospital every day.

1231
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:16,312
<i>It was a struggle.</i>

1232
01:16:16,345 --> 01:16:17,813
<i>He clearly wasn't himself.</i>

1233
01:16:17,846 --> 01:16:20,115
<i>Not like he was
when we were kids.</i>

1234
01:16:25,154 --> 01:16:27,189
<i>It was my idea for him
to check into care.</i>

1235
01:16:27,222 --> 01:16:31,126
<i>And the doctors did a lot of
tests and things and decided</i>

1236
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,196
<i>it was best for him to have
a bit of time to recover.</i>

1237
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:37,399
<i>Think it was best for him not
to be in the flat any more.</i>

1238
01:16:37,433 --> 01:16:40,302
<i>Doesn't matter about
all the ghost shit.</i>

1239
01:16:40,336 --> 01:16:43,706
<i>If it's real, if it's not,
it's irrelevant.</i>

1240
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:45,341
<i>He got put through the ringer.</i>

1241
01:16:45,374 --> 01:16:47,509
<i>Did he bring a lot
of that on himself?</i>

1242
01:16:47,543 --> 01:16:48,444
<i>Yeah.</i>

1243
01:16:49,378 --> 01:16:50,779
<i>But in my opinion,</i>

1244
01:16:50,813 --> 01:16:52,281
<i>the punishment
didn't fit the crime.</i>

1245
01:16:55,217 --> 01:16:57,553
I mean, it's funny, like,

1246
01:16:57,586 --> 01:16:58,954
after he almost died,
people seemed

1247
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:01,223
less willing to criticize him.

1248
01:17:02,424 --> 01:17:05,861
The whole thing just
quietly blew over.

1249
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:11,333
I still see him once a week.

1250
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:12,534
He seems happier.

1251
01:17:13,636 --> 01:17:16,639
And I have not been back
to the flat since.

1252
01:17:16,672 --> 01:17:19,475
Um, he's not had
any internet access.

1253
01:17:20,542 --> 01:17:24,446
And I think he's really trying
to kick this addiction.

1254
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,581
Cold turkey.

1255
01:17:25,614 --> 01:17:26,815
So as far as I'm aware,

1256
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:28,283
if he's seen anything,

1257
01:17:29,218 --> 01:17:30,686
he's not told me about it, so.

1258
01:17:32,554 --> 01:17:36,825
I kept asking him if I could
write a follow up biography.

1259
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:38,727
People would read that.

1260
01:17:38,761 --> 01:17:41,764
Um, but he stopped replying
to my messages,

1261
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:44,566
and ultimately
refused to see me.

1262
01:17:45,467 --> 01:17:47,202
What can I do? Fuck him.

1263
01:17:48,237 --> 01:17:50,006
No, I don't see him
anymore, I mean,

1264
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:53,409
he seems healthy now,
why would I interrupt that?

1265
01:17:53,442 --> 01:17:55,678
Plus I've got a lot
of things going on, you know,

1266
01:17:55,711 --> 01:17:58,313
uh, did I tell you about
my new YouTube series?

1267
01:17:59,415 --> 01:18:01,784
No, oh, right, okay,
so, well, it's called...

1268
01:18:01,817 --> 01:18:05,721
It's about as happy
an ending as we can hope for.

1269
01:18:05,754 --> 01:18:08,691
Graham's, like, mentally
the best he's ever been.

1270
01:18:10,026 --> 01:18:11,226
And in the end...

1271
01:18:12,628 --> 01:18:14,263
isn't that all we can ask for?

1272
01:18:15,864 --> 01:18:18,400
To be comfortable
in our own skin.

1273
01:18:18,434 --> 01:18:24,573
It's not care about likes
or views or whatever the fuck.

1274
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,277
How important are views anyway?

1275
01:18:39,055 --> 01:18:41,657
<i>But the views are important.</i>

1276
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,796
I wasn't keen on
this whole neat conclusion.

1277
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:51,400
Um, Graham has
a near death experience,

1278
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:56,438
goes into care, gets well again,
finds public love again.

1279
01:18:56,472 --> 01:18:59,942
Um, good for him,
but I didn't buy it.

1280
01:18:59,975 --> 01:19:02,544
I hate loose threads,
and it felt like

1281
01:19:02,578 --> 01:19:05,614
there were tons of
loose threads left over.

1282
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:07,950
So, I did some digging.

1283
01:19:08,951 --> 01:19:12,287
What I found was
Graham's YouTube channel.

1284
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:13,722
It was still live.

1285
01:19:13,756 --> 01:19:15,624
And this was
when he was in care,

1286
01:19:15,657 --> 01:19:17,659
and had no access
to the internet.

1287
01:19:18,927 --> 01:19:21,363
Seems a little
insensitive to me.

1288
01:19:21,396 --> 01:19:24,900
<i>Something stood out when
I was looking at his channel.</i>

1289
01:19:24,933 --> 01:19:27,736
<i>I checked the about page,
and the email address</i>

1290
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:30,073
<i>for business inquiries
looked familiar.</i>

1291
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:33,275
<i>"padthemouse," I'd seen
that somewhere before.</i>

1292
01:19:34,843 --> 01:19:37,913
<i>It was the same as
Steve's business address.</i>

1293
01:19:39,915 --> 01:19:42,317
Well here's where
it gets interesting.

1294
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:44,987
Erin claimed to have
no media presence really,

1295
01:19:45,021 --> 01:19:47,090
she wasn't on any social
media accounts

1296
01:19:47,123 --> 01:19:48,657
or anything like that.

1297
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:51,094
But, she did have
an Etsy account.

1298
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:54,363
Selling her "art."

1299
01:19:54,396 --> 01:19:57,499
<i>And when you go to contact
the store owner,</i>

1300
01:19:57,533 --> 01:19:59,701
<i>guess who? "padthemouse."</i>

1301
01:20:01,937 --> 01:20:03,939
- Just chill.
- Yeah, but if they fucking find out

1302
01:20:03,972 --> 01:20:06,909
we've been faking it, then we're
going to be in so much shit.

1303
01:20:06,942 --> 01:20:10,612
<i>So I find it odd that
through all of that tension...</i>

1304
01:20:10,646 --> 01:20:12,115
Help me out.

1305
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:13,715
<i>...animosity.</i>

1306
01:20:13,749 --> 01:20:15,551
- You're losing it, man.
- Just fucking leave.

1307
01:20:15,584 --> 01:20:17,020
<i>Through all of that,</i>

1308
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:18,954
<i>they shared
a business email address?</i>

1309
01:20:18,987 --> 01:20:22,025
<i>Did he not once try
to split their businesses?</i>

1310
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:25,594
<i>But the really strange thing...</i>

1311
01:20:26,762 --> 01:20:29,932
These channels and shops,
they were all set up

1312
01:20:29,965 --> 01:20:32,101
<i>before Graham and Erin allegedly</i>

1313
01:20:32,135 --> 01:20:33,669
<i>started collaborating
with Steve.</i>

1314
01:20:34,603 --> 01:20:36,172
<i>Before they even met him.</i>

1315
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:39,708
It makes me think
that everything,

1316
01:20:39,741 --> 01:20:41,577
including the internet downfall,

1317
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:43,946
all of it had been orchestrated

1318
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:46,381
and faked,
more than anyone realized.

1319
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:49,185
Well, I like where
your head's at,

1320
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,854
and it's good to meet
you and Erin.

1321
01:20:51,887 --> 01:20:53,089
Hey.

1322
01:20:53,122 --> 01:20:54,423
<i>If you look closely,</i>

1323
01:20:54,456 --> 01:20:55,891
<i>the clues are there.</i>

1324
01:20:55,924 --> 01:20:58,061
<i>Graham, Erin, and Steve
had met each other</i>

1325
01:20:58,094 --> 01:21:00,629
<i>before their first
alleged meeting.</i>

1326
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:02,031
Aye, it'll cost you extra.

1327
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:03,398
Target's holding, move, move.

1328
01:21:03,432 --> 01:21:04,167
F###!

1329
01:21:05,934 --> 01:21:07,669
<i>They'd made sketches before.</i>

1330
01:21:16,212 --> 01:21:19,048
<i>There's the shirt on
the radiator in Graham's flat.</i>

1331
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:24,187
<i>This was a month
before they claim</i>

1332
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:25,754
<i>to have met for the first time.</i>

1333
01:21:27,522 --> 01:21:28,924
It's fine.

1334
01:21:28,957 --> 01:21:31,526
I just need one more night,
one more night.

1335
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,196
<i>Erin left that
night, didn't she?</i>

1336
01:21:34,596 --> 01:21:37,233
<i>If that's the case, then what
was she doing back later,</i>

1337
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,734
<i>bursting out of the wall?</i>

1338
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,476
<i>The deeper you look,
the more the evidence piles up.</i>

1339
01:21:47,509 --> 01:21:49,112
Haven't seen Erin in a few days.

1340
01:21:49,145 --> 01:21:50,812
<i>If you haven't
seen Erin in days,</i>

1341
01:21:50,846 --> 01:21:52,514
<i>then what's she doing
in your flat?</i>

1342
01:22:01,957 --> 01:22:04,826
Look, the evidence is there.

1343
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,662
It may seem
more implausible to you,

1344
01:22:06,695 --> 01:22:09,032
but there are only two options.

1345
01:22:09,065 --> 01:22:13,535
Either this is
one of the most well documented,

1346
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:17,106
incredible cases
of a real haunting ever...

1347
01:22:18,507 --> 01:22:20,009
or it's an elaborate prank.

1348
01:22:21,044 --> 01:22:23,246
I guarantee you,
in a few months,

1349
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:25,181
once everyone's forgotten
this story,

1350
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:27,749
Graham's quietly going
to leave care,

1351
01:22:27,783 --> 01:22:30,119
rejoin society,
and he's going to have

1352
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:31,753
a ton of cash in the bank.

1353
01:22:32,654 --> 01:22:34,290
I can't force you to believe me.

1354
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:37,693
Unfortunately, evidence isn't
enough for people any more.

1355
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,730
Have you heard the allegations

1356
01:22:41,763 --> 01:22:43,999
that Alice has been
making about you?

1357
01:22:44,033 --> 01:22:45,500
Which ones?

1358
01:22:45,534 --> 01:22:46,868
That this whole thing
has been faked,

1359
01:22:46,902 --> 01:22:48,071
and that you
were working alongside

1360
01:22:48,104 --> 01:22:49,738
Erin and Graham this whole time.

1361
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:52,641
Oh, yeah, that one's a good one.

1362
01:22:52,674 --> 01:22:56,912
Um, okay, so listen,
I cut ties with Graham,

1363
01:22:56,945 --> 01:22:59,581
as soon as I gave him
the flat keys back, that was us.

1364
01:23:00,615 --> 01:23:02,185
What about the evidence
she's brought forward?

1365
01:23:04,586 --> 01:23:09,958
Well, can you believe
everything you see on camera?

1366
01:23:09,992 --> 01:23:10,892
No.

1367
01:23:12,061 --> 01:23:13,929
Like, seeing is believing,

1368
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:15,764
that just doesn't apply
any more.

1369
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:17,833
Does it?

1370
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:19,202
This could be faked.

1371
01:23:19,235 --> 01:23:20,169
You could be fake.

1372
01:23:21,237 --> 01:23:23,172
Who's to say what's real,
what's not?

1373
01:23:28,077 --> 01:23:29,345
So what do you make

1374
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:31,247
of the allegations
that you and Steve

1375
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,615
and Graham conspired
to fake this whole thing?

1376
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:35,318
Well...

1377
01:23:36,752 --> 01:23:39,255
We actually spoke, Alice and I,

1378
01:23:39,288 --> 01:23:40,655
and she showed me her evidence,

1379
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:42,924
and as far as I'm concerned,

1380
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,327
she has no evidence.

1381
01:23:46,895 --> 01:23:49,564
I don't know, I don't know
what to believe any more.

1382
01:23:49,598 --> 01:23:53,535
All I know is what I did
and what I didn't do, and...

1383
01:23:54,669 --> 01:23:56,305
I guess I have
to take comfort in that.

1384
01:23:56,339 --> 01:23:58,573
Some people say all sorts
of things about me,

1385
01:23:58,607 --> 01:24:01,010
but I know what's true,
and I know what's not true,

1386
01:24:01,044 --> 01:24:03,779
as well, and life goes on.

1387
01:24:05,747 --> 01:24:06,915
As does the afterlife.

1388
01:24:08,117 --> 01:24:10,819
If you believe that
sort of thing, so.

1389
01:24:54,163 --> 01:24:55,064
I'm back.

1390
01:24:58,967 --> 01:25:00,635
I've had a lot of time to think.

1391
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:08,311
And I've been back online, and

1392
01:25:08,344 --> 01:25:11,414
looking at everything
that's been posted.

1393
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:14,983
Everything that's
been said about me.

1394
01:25:15,017 --> 01:25:16,885
About the things that's
happened in this flat.

1395
01:25:22,691 --> 01:25:25,361
And I've had some time
to think about

1396
01:25:25,394 --> 01:25:27,996
what's really important to me.

1397
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:33,069
And...

1398
01:25:34,036 --> 01:25:37,039
I know that there's
only one thing I can do.

1399
01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:40,343
To, to prove...

1400
01:25:42,111 --> 01:25:43,812
that this whole
thing has been real...

1401
01:25:46,115 --> 01:25:47,716
and that I meant
every single word of it.

1402
01:27:14,879 --> 01:27:17,098
