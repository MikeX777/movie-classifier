1
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,564
No.

2
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,452
Hey!

3
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,947
Where's Howard and the rest
of the apprentices?

4
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,618
We left them at the bottom to find
their own way up!

5
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,786
They got to learn
sometime.

6
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,055
If you want to be
a troubleshooter,

7
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,357
you got to know
the mine.

8
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,830
Is it all clear
down there?

9
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,764
Yeah, we won't
need these anymore,

10
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,358
but I wouldn't go
lighting any matches.

11
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,604
Damn methane.

12
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,539
It's going to blow
this place to shit one of these days.

13
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,305
We ain't that lucky.

14
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,511
Whoo, hey, come on, now.
Knock it off.

15
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,196
Howard!

16
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,289
Hey, Howard!

17
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,561
Hey! Enjoy
your walk up?

18
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,569
Yeah, real joke.
Why didn't you guys wait?

19
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,696
Look, Landers, you got
to get a lot of exercise

20
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,706
if you're going to
grapple with Gretchen.

21
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,537
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
a Valentine for her

22
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,008
that she's never
going to forget.

23
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,840
Right to the heart, huh?

24
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,278
It's going to be a hot time
on Saturday night!

25
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,077
Yee-haw!

26
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,209
Hey, Stavinski, you do
anything else with that

27
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,878
except throw it
over your shoulder and burp it?

28
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,787
Aw, get lost, Axel.

29
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,826
Oh, bunch of clowns. Things haven't
changed a bit. Same as always.

30
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,952
Bet you wish
you never came back.

31
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,998
Especially now since Sarah's
going out with Axel.

32
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,033
No skin off my nose.

33
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,070
I don't give a damn.

34
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,072
Come on, last one
into town gets the brew.

35
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,574
Let's go.

36
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,734
Okay.

37
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,869
Let's go, guys!
Whoo-ha!

38
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,383
Quitting time!
Casanova is here!

39
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,890
Yee-haw!

40
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,119
Gretchen, it's me.

41
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,661
Howard,
stay away from me.

42
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,458
Hi, babe.

43
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,091
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

44
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,227
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

45
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,895
Hi, sweetie.

46
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,766
You big brute,
I missed you.

47
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,906
Anything I should know?

48
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,248
No.
Of course not.

49
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,015
Gretchen, I want you
to be my date for the dance. Will you?

50
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,488
Dry up.

51
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,616
Gretchen, you know
what would look really good on you?

52
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,717
- What?
- Me.

53
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,126
Suck it in and
zip it up, will you?

54
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,029
Gretchen,
why fight it?

55
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,464
Oof.

56
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,195
Let the good times
roll.

57
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,499
All right!

58
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,165
Hi, fellas.

59
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,640
Mabel, this is the best thing
that's happened to this town in years.

60
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,109
Your decorating committee
has done one hell of a job.

61
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,373
Well, after all,

62
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,540
the first Valentine's
dance in 20 years

63
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,606
has to be
something special.

64
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,584
Uh, yeah, well, uh,

65
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,951
of course, you're right,
Mabel, but I think we'd all be better off

66
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,683
if you played down
the fact

67
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,055
that it's the first Valentine's dance
in 20 years,

68
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,594
if you know
what I mean.

69
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,995
Let's just concentrate
on having a good time Saturday night

70
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,870
and put all that
other business to rest.

71
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,466
My thoughts
exactly, Mayor.

72
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,641
Hi, guy.

73
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,413
Oh, come on,
you clowns!

74
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,684
Help Miss Osborne
pick those things up.

75
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,987
What the hell are
you kids doing in here?

76
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,688
You're supposed to be
decorating the room,

77
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,889
not each other.

78
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,367
Where you going,
son?

79
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,369
Where I always go
this time of day--

80
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,806
for another beer
and a real good nose pick.

81
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,740
Ooh!
I'm sorry, TJ.

82
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,310
I don't think he likes
being back in the mine very much.

83
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,543
Well, that's too bad.

84
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,415
Nobody told him to go out
to the West Coast.

85
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,046
It's not my fault
he couldn't make it on his own.

86
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,680
But now that
he's back here,

87
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,418
he's my son and he's
working in the mine.

88
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,630
You guys better put those things back
where you found them,

89
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,893
or I'll turn you both upside down.
Especially you.

90
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,231
This is my date, Chief.

91
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,328
Chief, that meeting
in Centerville is at 7.:00.

92
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,770
Maybe we should
hit the road.

93
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,332
Then let's go.
I'll see you kids later. Bye, Mabel.

94
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,640
- Keep up the good work.
- See you, Chief.

95
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,441
I might as well go too.

96
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,948
All of this will have
to be rewashed.

97
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,507
I'm really sorry, Mabel.

98
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,217
This is station QPlD,
940 on your radio dial...

99
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,817
Oh.

100
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,555
Mayor!

101
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,628
Mayor?

102
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,292
Mayor, somebody
left this for you.

103
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,098
For me?
Who was it?

104
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,139
I don't know. It was already inside
when we got here.

105
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,003
Maybe you got
a secret admirer, huh?

106
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,133
You in on this, Mabel?

107
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,236
I'm afraid not, Mayor.

108
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,209
Oh, no.

109
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,615
No no.
Don't look at me.

110
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,551
I didn't have a thing
to do with it.

111
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,353
Oh, well, hell,

112
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,652
I've been looking
for an excuse

113
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,922
to get off this miserable diet
Mrs. Hanniger has me on.

114
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,087
Thanks, Howard.

115
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,290
If there's one thing
I like better

116
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,596
than Christmas candy,
it's Valentine's candy.

117
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,930
Have some.

118
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,766
Hey...

119
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,305
who sent it?

120
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,904
"From the heart
comes a warning

121
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,945
filled with
bloody good cheer--

122
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,207
remember what happened

123
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,909
as the 14th draws near."

124
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,450
It can't be
happening again.

125
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,549
It can't be happening
again.

126
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,078
Broken-down bar...

127
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,456
It's a bad time,

128
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,925
this time of year.

129
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,155
Bad things coming.

130
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,027
My words, you hear.

131
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,765
Beware the 14th

132
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,599
- if you value your life.
- Here we go again.

133
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,106
How many times is he
going to tell this story?

134
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,143
Oh, let him tell it.
I love fairy tales.

135
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,202
This ain't no fairy tale,
little girl.

136
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,544
If you don't
take it seriously,

137
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,981
you're a fool.

138
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,416
Ohh!

139
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,544
Hurt yourself?

140
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,613
Axel, are you okay?

141
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,318
Oh, no.
Let me see.

142
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,496
I know what
I'm talking about.

143
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,195
I'm telling you now,

144
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,238
this town is a-cursed.

145
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,373
Now it started
20 years ago.

146
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,775
It was the night
of the Valentine's Day dance

147
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,779
at the Union Hall--

148
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,747
the biggest event of the year.

149
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:01,276
It had been a tradition
for over 100 years.

150
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,982
Everybody was there,
except for seven miners

151
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,753
who were out
at the Henniger Mine,

152
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,160
five of them
still down below.

153
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,131
Two supervisors
were waiting for the men to come up.

154
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,464
Anxious to get
to the party,

155
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,527
they left before
the men were safely out

156
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,300
failing to check
the methane gas levels

157
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,170
in the tunnels
down below.

158
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,085
The five men
were buried alive

159
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,178
as the town
continued its party.

160
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,985
For six weeks,
we dug around the clock

161
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,051
to try to save them.

162
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,495
After we broke through,

163
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,055
one man was found alive.

164
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,837
I was the one
who found him.

165
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,537
Harry Warden spent the next year
in the state mental hospital.

166
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,844
Exactly one year later,

167
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,907
on Valentine's Day,

168
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,476
he came back to town.

169
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,987
He killed
the two supervisors

170
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,455
who had left their posts
the year before.

171
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,251
Then he cut out
their hearts

172
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,230
and stuffed them into
heart-shaped candy boxes.

173
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,325
That night at the dance
we found the boxes,

174
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,370
blood dripping
out the sides.

175
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,631
Inside was a note--

176
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,732
a warning from Harry

177
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,938
never to hold
a Valentine's dance

178
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,844
ever again.

179
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,380
Every February 14,

180
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,113
Harry comes back to town,

181
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,884
his pickax
stained with blood,

182
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,654
waiting in the shadows
of the Henniger Mine...

183
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,196
just for someone
to kill

184
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,165
should they not heed
his warning.

185
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,667
It could be you.

186
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,334
I know what I'm saying.

187
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,842
You forget about having a party
at all on Saturday night,

188
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,536
or you may not live
to see daylight.

189
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,548
Laugh now...

190
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,343
but you'll be sorry
you didn't listen to me.

191
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,753
Uh-oh.

192
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,849
Come on, Hap,
lighten up.

193
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,291
It's a stupid legend.

194
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,693
It gives me
the creeps.

195
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,697
Hi, you guys.
Who ordered the Moosehead?

196
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,292
I did, you gorgeous slab
of female fleshiness.

197
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,269
# Oh #

198
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,039
## There is a young barmaid
named Harriet ##

199
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,946
## Who has never been robbed
of her cherry yet ##

200
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,484
## Oh, try as she may ##

201
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,852
## This girl
can't get laid ##

202
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,086
## A Valentine virgin
named Harriet. ##

203
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,688
I hate that song.

204
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,098
I mean,
it's, like, uh--

205
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,535
hey, where you going?

206
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,869
I just want to put on
some music, okay?

207
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,772
Be my guest.

208
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,142
Excuse me.

209
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,403
Excuse me.

210
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,857
It's your own fault.
You know that, don't you, TJ?

211
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,394
Never said it wasn't.

212
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,822
Then why can't you
just accept things the way they are?

213
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,461
Maybe because I don't like
the way things are.

214
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,605
Excuse me.

215
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,416
Yes, all right.

216
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,585
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

217
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,424
I have to call
in the morning.

218
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,397
The administration office
is closed at night.

219
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,491
The nurse that's on duty
doesn't know a thing.

220
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,004
Well, she's got to know whether
he's there or not.

221
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,937
I just hope this is
some kind of joke

222
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,498
and the kids are just trying to scare
the hell out of us.

223
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:21,205
If it is a joke, I want every one of
those kids strung up,

224
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,010
starting with that damn
Howard Landers!

225
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,608
Well, it's a human
heart, all right.

226
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,449
A young woman,
about 30 years old.

227
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,546
What the hell are you guys doing
with a loose heart?

228
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,784
Looks like a butcher
ripped this thing out.

229
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,659
What's going on over
in Valentine Bluffs?

230
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,288
You remember
Harry Warden?

231
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,725
God, of course
I remember.

232
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,462
Those were
terrible murders.

233
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,932
God, I thought
they locked him up in Eastfield

234
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,975
20 years ago.

235
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,566
They did.

236
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,203
Are you sure
he's still there?

237
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,213
We'll find out in the morning.
I'm checking on it.

238
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,839
Well, gentlemen,

239
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,440
I'd say you have
your answer.

240
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,215
It looks like Harry Warden's
back in town.

241
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,289
Well, now,

242
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,129
I wonder who sent this?

243
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,361
Jake?

244
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,301
Ohh.

245
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,338
"Roses are red,
violets are blue...

246
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,050
one is dead,

247
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,813
and so are you"?

248
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,857
No!

249
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,292
No! Get away!
Get away!

250
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,795
Get away!

251
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,330
No! No!

252
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,331
Get away!
No! No!

253
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,345
No! No!

254
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,722
Hey, this is getting
really good.

255
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,223
Don't put
your nose in it.

256
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,789
Hey, this is what
I really call junk food.

257
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,331
How much longer, Hollis?
I'm freezing.

258
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,264
Hey, relax.
This thing ain't no microwave.

259
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,632
Hey, how about
revving it up?

260
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,398
Man, have I got
the munchies.

261
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,996
Yeah, me, too.
A little protein patrol, hey, boys?

262
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,042
Don't go
poking my meat.

263
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,811
It's hardly cooked.

264
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,639
Don't go sticking
your nose in the food.

265
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,512
It's his. He can do what
he wants with it.

266
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,950
Is that turkey, Hollis?
I asked for roast beef.

267
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,884
Turkey for the turkey.

268
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,351
Here.

269
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,192
Come on, shove over.

270
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,511
Sure is cold tonight.

271
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,070
Yeah.

272
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,893
Well, I guess we got
ourselves a problem, huh?

273
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,302
Yeah.

274
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,464
Yeah, I guess so.

275
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,806
What are we going
to do about it?

276
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,372
Well, there ain't
nothing to do about it.

277
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,653
Sarah's
going with me now

278
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,347
and that's
all there is to it.

279
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,687
I ain't going to back off
for you, TJ.

280
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,556
Nobody asked you
to go away, TJ.

281
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,653
Come on, Axel, don't give me
any of that horseshit.

282
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,698
I mean, you're beginning
to sound like my old man.

283
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,289
Too bad, man.

284
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,062
Look, you left.
You left.

285
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,898
You went away, and we didn't know
where you were

286
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,961
or-- or when the hell
you were coming back.

287
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,374
I ain't going to back off
for you, TJ.

288
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,035
You stay the hell
away from Sarah.

289
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,203
All right, all right.

290
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,839
You want a fight,
then you got it.

291
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,440
Because you and l
both know who Sarah wants.

292
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,804
You were kind of
hard on him, Teege.

293
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,074
You can't exactly
blame him.

294
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,345
Sure, it's not his fault.
It's nobody's fault.

295
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,079
I don't know
what to do.

296
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,178
You know, I really do like
that son of a bitch.

297
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,419
Hey, remember--

298
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,551
remember how we used to tear
this place apart?

299
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,562
Eh? Get drunk,
race out to the bluffs?

300
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,120
That was great.

301
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,436
I guess
things change, huh?

302
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,829
Nothing stays the same.

303
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,451
W-A-R-D-E-N.

304
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,579
Harry Warden.
He was committed under court order

305
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,054
approximately
20 years ago.

306
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,114
Well, I'm afraid
I have no records

307
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,989
of a Harry Warden,
past or present.

308
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,858
But how can that be?
He was committed there

309
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,261
under court order.

310
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,027
I'm sorry.
I have no records on him.

311
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,899
Look, in 20 years, any number of things
could have happened.

312
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,406
Now if this Harry Warden
was committed, as you say,

313
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,135
then he's simply
no longer here.

314
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,733
And if I have
no records on him,

315
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,871
I have to assume that he's transferred,
he's released,

316
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,643
or he's on the slab.
One of three, take your pick.

317
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,184
One out of three?

318
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,720
Now look, Mrs. Raleigh, you're
going to have to do

319
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,619
a little bit better
than that.

320
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,352
Now I have to know
what happened to this man

321
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,326
and I have to know
what happened to him now.

322
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,124
Now have you
checked everything?

323
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,357
Everything...

324
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,899
except the microfilms
over in central file,

325
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,128
and it will take
several days to check that.

326
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,034
Look, I need answers
and I need them fast.

327
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,696
I'll be waiting
for your call.

328
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,504
Dr. Peyton, 3-5-3.

329
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,408
Jumping J--

330
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,242
they don't even know what the hell
happened to him.

331
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,145
Well, w-what
do we need to know?

332
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,184
It's got to be Harry.

333
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,947
Maybe we ought
to cancel the dance.

334
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,888
Just decide which one
you really want.

335
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,220
And now for
the big moment--

336
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,090
will it be number one,
or will it be number two?

337
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,561
Patty, will you
be serious?

338
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,427
This is important.

339
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,761
You can't have them
both, you know.

340
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,028
- I don't want them both.
- Oh, no?

341
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,228
No.

342
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,702
Just what I thought.

343
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,675
Oh, I don't know.
TJ won't talk to me.

344
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,974
He just sulks
all day long.

345
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,343
He ends up making me
feel guilty,

346
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,076
when he's the one
who owes me the apology.

347
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,448
And Axel is not
behaving any better.

348
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,580
Oh, Patty, I don't even want to go
to the dance on Saturday night.

349
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,918
Oh, but you got to go.

350
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,788
It'll be all right.
Just stay with Hollis and me.

351
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,759
Besides, you got to see
the dress I got--

352
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,160
cut down to here,
slit up to there.

353
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,721
I may not get out alive.

354
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,416
Mabel?

355
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,058
Mabel, I got
to talk to you.

356
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,859
We got a problem
concerning the dance.

357
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,730
Mabel!

358
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,602
Mabel, you back here?

359
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,690
Okay.
Little John?

360
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,362
I want you and Mike
to check the wall.

361
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,699
TJ,

362
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,364
take care of the sump.

363
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,136
You get a pump down there,
or I ain't doing it.

364
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,508
You do it or you get
your ass out of here for good.

365
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,514
I'll do it.

366
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,049
I'll do it.

367
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,415
What's bugging
him today?

368
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,717
Son of a bitch
is after my ass

369
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,314
because of Sarah.

370
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,018
If he keeps it up,
I'm going to nail him.

371
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,186
I said move it,
Hanniger!

372
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,729
Oh, yeah.
Come on, man.

373
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,164
Anytime, loser.

374
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,402
Hey, that's it!
Break it up, you two!

375
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,571
TJ, you get your ass
up top to crew 17.

376
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,411
Go!

377
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,680
There ain't going to be no fighting
in my section, Palmer!

378
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,050
Understand?

379
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,005
What an awful smell.

380
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,904
This is like it was
20 years ago.

381
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,882
I can remember those murders
just like it was yesterday.

382
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,942
Jake, you got to get
help from Granville.

383
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,748
No, not yet.

384
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,381
If we call in Granville, we'll have police
crawling all over this place

385
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,789
and we'll have a hell
of a panic on our hands.

386
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,226
You just mention
that Harry's back

387
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,698
and this town won't
be worth the powder to blow it to hell.

388
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,291
Uh, just a minute.
Just a minute, boys.

389
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,461
Uh...

390
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,472
I want you to bring
the ambulance around back.

391
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,633
Load her up from there.

392
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,644
I don't want anybody
in town seeing this.

393
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,373
You remember--

394
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,540
Mabel Osborne died
of a heart attack

395
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,743
and that's all.

396
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,251
You breathe one word
of this to anybody

397
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,288
and you'll have
to answer to me.

398
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,992
Wait a minute.
What's this?

399
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,725
Take her away.

400
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,737
"lt happened once,

401
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,904
it happened twice.

402
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,875
Cancel the dance
or it'll happen thrice."

403
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,508
Oh, well,

404
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,519
th-th-that's it.

405
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,817
The dance is canceled.

406
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,551
Let's tear every poster,
every banner,

407
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,822
every decoration down
and-- and out of sight.

408
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,955
I don't want to see a single Valentine's
heart anywhere.

409
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,263
As long as this town is
decorated to the hilt,

410
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,859
Harry's going
to keep on killing.

411
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,134
And-- and get that damn
Union Hall locked up.

412
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,765
All right.
All right, Mayor.

413
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,005
No, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do about it.

414
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,444
Hey, what's going on?

415
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,981
The mayor has
canceled the dance

416
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,643
and that's
all there is to it.

417
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:57,745
Well, in the light of Mabel's death,
he had no choice.

418
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,153
There'll be
no parties, either.

419
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,089
We owe her
that much respect.

420
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,683
Mabel would've wanted us
to have the dance.

421
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,057
I mean, she worked
so hard on it.

422
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,618
Yeah, you can't
cancel it now.

423
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,995
He's just looking for an excuse to
cancel the dance.

424
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,227
That's the way it is.

425
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,667
They'll be no dance
tomorrow night

426
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,638
and no parties, either.
Do you understand me?

427
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,035
Hanniger!

428
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,379
You and me have
something to settle!

429
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,213
You bet we do.

430
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,388
Howard, you got
to chew it.

431
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,687
You don't
blow bubbles with it.

432
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,853
I'll take care
of myself.

433
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,420
How'd you ever get
to be so stupid?

434
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,261
I'm going to shower.

435
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,407
TJ, will you stop this?
I don't want to go with you.

436
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,749
Are you
listening to me?

437
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,014
Nope.

438
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,253
Remember this spot?

439
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,614
Of course I remember
this spot.

440
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,209
Why didn't you
write me, TJ?

441
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,408
Why didn't you call?

442
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,184
I wanted to, believe me,

443
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,515
but I couldn't.

444
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,086
I mean, I really fell
on my ass out there.

445
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,457
I made so many mistakes.

446
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,894
But I learned something.

447
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,937
Look...

448
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,533
give me a chance.

449
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,078
If you still want me
to go away, I will.

450
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,047
But I have to tell you that I love you
and I want you back.

451
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:42,348
How was I supposed
to know that, Jessie?

452
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,584
I honestly didn't think
you were ever coming back.

453
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,625
You just left me here.

454
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,892
Sarah, please.

455
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,588
I'm sorry.

456
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,690
I'm so damn sorry.

457
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,816
## That's all I am ##

458
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,985
## And, girl,
I don't expect you ##

459
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,182
## To understand ##

460
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,225
## I just play my song ##

461
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,760
## And right or wrong ##

462
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,657
## My music's
all I need ##

463
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,131
## To get along ##

464
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,126
## Women and wine
don't thrill me ##

465
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,535
## Like they used to... ##

466
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,675
Have you seen Sarah?

467
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,477
Ain't my turn
to watch after her.

468
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,472
Damn it, Sarah,
why do you do this to yourself?

469
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,708
How am I going
to tell Axel?

470
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,418
Sarah!

471
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,926
Chief Newby.

472
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,732
I'm sorry
I startled you.

473
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,170
It's all right.

474
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,901
Is something the matter?

475
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,271
No, I'm--

476
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,644
I'm just making
my nightly patrol.

477
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,546
Right.

478
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,612
Good night, Chief.

479
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,680
Oh, good night,
Sarah.

480
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,663
Give me a beer, Hap.

481
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,301
You hear about
Mabel Osborne?

482
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,896
She got it just
the way I said.

483
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,667
Heart attack,
my ass.

484
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,605
Well, if we aren't going to have
a Valentine's dance,

485
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,770
what are
we going to do?

486
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,041
Why don't we have
a Valentine party?

487
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,515
Yeah, a party!

488
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:30,042
Where? Newby's got this whole town
locked up, bright guy.

489
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,521
How about
my father's mine, huh?

490
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,492
- TJ, are you crazy? Come on.
- The mine!

491
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,663
In the mine?

492
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,062
That'd be great.

493
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,532
It would.
What a blast.

494
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,330
In the mine?
That's exactly what it would be.

495
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,371
Oh, it'd be
great!

496
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,463
Come on, Hollis. We've got everything
we need down there.

497
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,599
We got, uh, let's see,
we got a rec room.

498
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,234
We got a pool table.
Everything.

499
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,008
Yeah, in the mine...
where people get killed and eaten.

500
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,708
Beware of
Harry Warden.

501
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,411
Whooo!

502
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,544
Shut the fuck up.

503
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,987
Beware of what you make fun of,
you little asshole.

504
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,116
- Who?
- You.

505
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,025
Forget about having
a party at all tomorrow night

506
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,255
or you'll be sorry.

507
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,894
Hey, lighten up, Hap.

508
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,401
Piss on Harry Warden
and that damn old legend.

509
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,063
We're gonna have
ourselves a party.

510
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,471
Don't you
go telling nobody.

511
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,067
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

512
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,641
That settles it then.

513
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,946
We're going to the mine
and we're going to have ourselves a party.

514
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,390
Assholes.

515
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,983
Damn kids.
I'll show them.

516
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,215
Piss on Harry Warden,
will they?

517
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,780
Well, I'll give them
a scare they'll never forget.

518
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,166
Ah.

519
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,454
Hey, it's
party time.

520
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,831
Where are
the wieners?

521
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,040
Hey, Hollis,
here's the wieners!

522
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,425
Hi, Ben.
Anything happen?

523
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,188
No, it's been quiet
all evening.

524
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,024
Good.

525
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,428
That came for you
though.

526
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,393
Oh my God.

527
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,844
Go and get me
a coffee, will you, Ben?

528
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,709
Yeah, sure, Chief.

529
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,214
Mabel.

530
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,888
Yooo! Does anybody
want a beer?

531
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,451
Eat you up.
Mmm!

532
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,464
Whoo!

533
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,397
Hollis,
check this out.

534
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,191
You asshole!

535
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,872
Hey, who busted
the lock?

536
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,101
- I got the keys right here.
- Howard did.

537
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,336
- Uh-oh.
- Howard.

538
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,879
Harry Warden did it.

539
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,438
And whoever parked the red
Volkswagen out front,

540
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,110
I want it parked out back
with the others like I said.

541
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,551
I don't want Newby
snooping around here.

542
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,589
Let me show you.

543
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:01,137
- Hey, hold it.
- Whoa.

544
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,674
Hey, John,
where you going?

545
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,182
Sylvia's gonna
get it tonight.

546
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,420
Talk to you
in a minute, okay?

547
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,427
So you're looking
pretty good, baby face.

548
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,766
What's the occasion?

549
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,500
I figured it'll get
Newby off my back.

550
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,737
Besides, I want to get out
of this town pretty quick.

551
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,006
You know, I think
he really likes you.

552
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,410
I've got the munchies.

553
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,899
Hot dogs.

554
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,801
Here, Spot.

555
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,276
Hey, what's going on?
Who is that?

556
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,737
I, uh, I got a feeling
about the mine, Ben.

557
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,076
I'll-- I'll check back
with you, all right?

558
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,209
Make sure you call me on the radio
if anything comes up.

559
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,650
Will do.

560
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,616
Now what the hell
is that?

561
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,792
Go on!

562
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,362
Go on!

563
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,675
Go on, get the hell
out of here.

564
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,495
"You didn't stop
the party."

565
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,763
Stop the party?

566
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,864
What damn party?

567
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,493
Stavinski, you couldn't
clean that table with a broom.

568
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,554
Hollis, you don't even
know what pool means.

569
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,122
Hey, guys, check this out.
Check this out.

570
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,259
Gretchen,
this is for you.

571
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,566
Oh, wow.

572
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,041
First time I try to snort Coke, man,
and I almost drown.

573
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,203
Next time,
try harder.

574
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,879
- Axel, please.
- Oh, come on.

575
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,577
- Axel, please don't.
- What's the matter, baby?

576
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,280
- Axel, please don't.
- Oh, come on!

577
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,983
Will you please
stop it?

578
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:37,254
Guess you better
back off there, Axel.

579
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,386
Back the fuck off,
man.

580
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,626
We were doing just fine until you decided
to come crawling home.

581
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,099
Well, in case you haven't noticed,
things have changed around here.

582
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,500
She don't want nothing
to do with you.

583
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,131
Do you mind?
I have my own mouth, thank you.

584
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,835
Then why don't you use it?
Tell him.

585
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,844
Tell me what?

586
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,975
She wants to come back
with me.

587
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,277
Bullshit, man.

588
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,683
Why don't you
both just back off?

589
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,722
You're acting like
a couple of jerks.

590
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,286
Oh, well, you just
love it, don't you?

591
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,060
That's it!

592
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,995
You son of a bitch!

593
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,005
Hollis, do something.

594
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,108
Hollis!

595
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,839
Let go.

596
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,848
Shit!
Will you guys knock it off?

597
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,719
TJ, are you
out of shape.

598
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,755
Get out of here!

599
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,427
Are you sure
you're okay?

600
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,812
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for that to happen.

601
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,521
TJ, please stop it.

602
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,122
I just don't care
anymore.

603
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,928
Just leave me alone.

604
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,067
Okay, listen. I showed
you how to do it

605
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,338
with the right nostril,
right?

606
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,936
Now you take the straw
and you put it up the neck,

607
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,005
the left nostril, right?
And you snort it.

608
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,308
Come on, loosen up.
Let's have fun.

609
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,617
We're at a Valentine's party,
for God's sake.

610
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,884
I got a little
punchy myself.

611
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,166
How do you
get those down?

612
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,007
- Pull the rope.
- Just pull it?

613
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,112
Yeah yeah.
Release the hook and let it go.

614
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,452
You know what we need?

615
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,186
Yeah, I got one
right here.

616
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,257
No, I meant
a couple of beers.

617
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,458
Oh. I'll go
get them.

618
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:04,693
I'll go with you.

619
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,498
No, you stay here
and I'll be back in a flash.

620
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,369
Okay?

621
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,408
Okay, but don't take
too long.

622
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:16,446
Back in a minute.

623
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,239
Okay. Bye.

624
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,840
Bye.

625
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,563
Hey, TJ.

626
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,108
Hey, John,
how you doing?

627
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,940
I'm doing great.
Is something the matter?

628
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,781
The same old shit.

629
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,448
Well, Howard really
makes me gag.

630
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,888
You're not kidding.

631
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,515
If anyone, I kinda
like Tommy.

632
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,958
Oh, I agree.

633
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,620
- Hi, John.
- Hi, girls.

634
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,958
Yuck, what is this?

635
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:14,470
Oh, wow. One of those idiots
really thinks he's funny.

636
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,298
It's probably Howard.

637
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,283
John, is that you?

638
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,689
John?

639
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:24,271
John, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing a good job.

640
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,001
John?

641
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,446
Oh!

642
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,419
No! No! No!

643
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,819
Help! Help!

644
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,261
Oh no!

645
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,891
No!

646
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:54,027
Oh no!

647
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,230
Oh!

648
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,904
Sorry I took
so long, babe.

649
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,645
Sylvia?

650
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,012
Sylvia!

651
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,185
All right.

652
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,458
Hey, all right.
All right.

653
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:58,194
Sylvia, I know
you're in there.

654
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,702
And I'm coming in.

655
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,330
Sylvia.

656
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,539
Come in, Mobile One.

657
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,544
Mobile One, in.

658
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,103
Jake, you just
got a call from Eastfield.

659
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,173
A woman named Raleigh.
She said it was urgent.

660
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:52,244
All right.
Mobile One, coming in.

661
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:03,332
Hey, how about
a little trip down to the mine?

662
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,992
- The mine?
- Yeah, it'll be great. Come on.

663
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,729
It's supposed to be
like a roller coaster, isn't it?

664
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,464
It's 2,000 feet down.

665
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,063
That's okay. It'll cheer her up anyway.
Come on, Hollis.

666
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,041
Come on, Mike,
let's go.

667
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,974
What? Hey, Hollis, you
going down to the mine?

668
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,478
- Well--
- Yes. Yes.

669
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,344
Come on.
Come on, Hollis.

670
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,940
- Chicken.
- Chicken?

671
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,678
Hey, why don't we
go down to the mine?

672
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,482
All right. One quick ride down
and then right back up.

673
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:28,388
- Hey, what about gear?
- Yeah, get that six-pack.

674
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,626
It's going to be
great, baby!

675
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,890
Ow!

676
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,836
Watch your step.
Come on.

677
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,169
- This is ridiculous.
- This is gonna be great.

678
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,673
Hollis!

679
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,147
Where do you think
you're going?

680
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,649
We're just going
to go for a quick ride

681
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:55,878
and come right back up.
Believe me.

682
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,010
You can't take them
down there.

683
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,318
You know the rule.
No women in the mine.

684
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,358
We're gonna come right back up again.
Believe me.

685
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,619
- Come on.
- Watch your step.

686
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,893
Howard, don't be a pain
in the ass.

687
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,527
Pain in the ass?
What pain in the ass?

688
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,368
Be careful.
Be careful.

689
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,533
Down we go.

690
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,607
Come on, you guys, hop in the cars.
I'll be right back.

691
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,150
- Yeah, we made it.
- You just let me know.

692
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,659
Here, Sarah,
put this around you.

693
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,992
Michael.
Michael!

694
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,431
Here you go.
And a blanket.

695
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,230
Hey, Hollis,
you got one for me?

696
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,600
Here's one for you.
I'll be right back.

697
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,265
Do you believe we're
really doing this?

698
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,112
It's so dark
down there.

699
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,081
On second thought,
I think I'm gonna stay right up here.

700
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,175
Oh, no, you don't.
If I'm going down there, baby,

701
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,311
- you're going with me.
- Oh, great.

702
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,117
Hey, hold on, everybody.
Here we go.

703
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,181
Keep your hands inside.

704
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,954
And pass me that beer.

705
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,892
All right.

706
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,725
Come on, pass a couple
up this way.

707
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,289
- Where's the lantern?
- Right here. You just stick with me.

708
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,233
Whoo-hoo!

709
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,774
Down she goes.

710
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,080
Hold on.
Get ready to stop.

711
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,950
Hey, Hollis, pass me a beer.
Want one, Mike?

712
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,087
How far down
does it go?

713
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,188
300 miles deep.

714
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,733
- Come on, Sarah.
- Here you go.

715
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,598
You're down here
every night?

716
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,107
Wow.

717
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,984
Oh, little bit of a free ride.
There we go.

718
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,584
Stops all by itself.

719
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,789
Yeah, I hope you kids enjoyed yourself,
'cause we're going right back up.

720
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,230
Oh, that was great, Hollis.

721
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,028
- Let's do it again.
- Howard usually walks.

722
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,497
Oh, let's do it again, Hollis.
Come on.

723
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,670
Hey, where does that go?

724
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,265
Oh, that leads to
an abandoned part.

725
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,867
We don't go down
there anymore.

726
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,344
- Oh, take us on a tour, Hollis.
- Yeah.

727
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,937
Yeah, let's show
them around.

728
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,312
All right.
All right.

729
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,941
Just because we're here.
Come on.

730
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,645
Keep those blankets
wrapped around you.

731
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,187
- You're gonna get chilly.
- Okay, honey.

732
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,016
It's cold.

733
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,222
All right, boys and girls,
this is called a tipple.

734
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,058
So that's a tipple.

735
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,462
This is also called
a tipple.

736
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,229
- Hey, Howard, come on!
- Coming!

737
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,238
- Hey, Howard, come on!
- I'm coming!

738
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,740
I just heard something.
Probably some rats.

739
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,743
Rats! You never told me
there were rats.

740
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:11,075
This is the old engine room.

741
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,705
Oh, uh-huh.

742
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,249
Boy, what a nice view
back here.

743
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,581
Howard.

744
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,485
Hey, Hollis.

745
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,028
We'll meet you in 10 minutes
over at the main shaft.

746
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:29,155
All right. No longer.
We're going straight up.

747
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,444
It's pretty dark.

748
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,320
How do you like
my pad, huh?

749
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,048
It's okay.

750
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,124
I can't believe
you work here.

751
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,223
Yep.

752
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,613
- He's in there!
- What is it?

753
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,211
What's the matter?

754
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,689
He's in there.
He's in there.

755
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,621
What's going on?
What's going on?

756
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,065
Dead.
He-- he--

757
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,832
- What are you talking about?
- He killed her.

758
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,738
What are you
talking about?

759
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,105
Dave is dead!

760
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:50,043
No!
No!

761
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,013
No!

762
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,951
TJ, it's Sylvia.
Somebody's killed her.

763
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,680
It's Harry Warden.
He's here!

764
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,415
Everybody get
the fuck out!

765
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,754
Go! Go! Go!

766
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,659
Come on, come on!

767
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:13,327
Son of a bitch must have cut
the phone lines.

768
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,064
Okay, now listen.
I want you to make sure

769
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,572
that everybody
gets out of here.

770
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,902
And I want you
to get the chief

771
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,068
and tell him to get
here and fast.

772
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,441
Now go!

773
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,307
Sarah, she's in the mine
with the others.

774
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:29,646
What?

775
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,710
Her, Hollis
and Patty.

776
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,278
They took the railcars
down there.

777
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,916
They're in the mine right now.
We gotta get them out.

778
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,552
That's where that crazy guy probably is.
Look, he'll kill them!

779
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:40,994
I'm gonna get her out.

780
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,760
Come on.
Come on!

781
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,605
Go! Go!

782
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,941
Come on.

783
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,914
If anything happens
to Sarah, it'll be your fault.

784
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,852
You never should have
let them go down there.

785
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,720
Damn it, let's just worry about
getting them out.

786
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,883
I'll take
the abandoned section,

787
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,119
you take
the level above.

788
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,025
We'll meet in the main shaft
by the elevator.

789
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:16,429
Hope to God
we get there before Harry does.

790
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,399
Good luck.

791
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,492
Where is he?

792
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,050
I don't know.

793
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,053
Boo!

794
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,623
Gotcha.

795
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,226
Damn you, Hollis.
Where the hell were you?

796
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,736
I thought you were
right behind me.

797
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,204
You must have gone down
the wrong tunnel.

798
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,673
Oh, sure we did.
You did that on purpose.

799
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,802
Me? Come on.

800
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,845
Okay.

801
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,143
Watch your head.

802
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,410
Watch your step
as well.

803
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,156
This is the oldest
part of the mine.

804
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,660
Oh, God!

805
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,788
These tunnels were
built in the early 1800s.

806
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:24,355
- Really?
- Yeah, it's all abandoned now.

807
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,661
Ooh.

808
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:28,761
We haven't worked
down here in years. Not since...

809
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,829
Harry Warden.

810
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,608
Howard, what do you
think you're trying to do, you jerk?

811
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:38,340
Easy, I've got
a hangover.

812
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,006
Boy, did you guys
jump!

813
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,777
Howard!

814
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,451
Oh, Howard,
you goof.

815
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,751
- Get down out of there.
- I'll go the other way.

816
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,315
- For Pete's sake.
- I know what I'm doing.

817
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:55,029
Oh, God, you guys.

818
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,564
Come on.
Hold it.

819
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,601
Oh, that feels so good.

820
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,136
- Okay.
- Okay.

821
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:03,866
- Get your light.
- All right. Okay.

822
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,237
- Okay?
- Yeah.

823
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,276
- You all right?
- Come on.

824
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,742
Get down!

825
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,870
Now stick with us and
quit clowning around.

826
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,505
Come on! I was just having
a little bit of fun.

827
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:13,844
Yeah yeah, sure.

828
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,282
Hey, you guys, where's
Mike and Harriet?

829
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,512
Maybe Harry Warden
got them.

830
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,111
Stop it.

831
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,951
Howard, come along
and behave yourself.

832
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,786
Yeah, let's go.

833
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:25,382
My blanket!

834
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,190
Oh, come on, you'd forget
your head

835
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,128
if it wasn't tied on with rope.
Let's go.

836
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,324
Come on, it's freezing
down here.

837
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,866
Hey, who's leading
this tour?

838
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,731
Well, go ahead if you want.

839
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,807
I feel so good.

840
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,212
So do l.

841
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,621
Where are we
going now, Hollis?

842
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,627
Oh, this leads to the main shaft.
We're going up.

843
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,596
How come the walls
are so white around here, Hollis?

844
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,633
I told you.
It's lime powder.

845
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,634
They put it here
to contain explosions

846
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,136
and they put it on the wood
so it doesn't get dry and crack.

847
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,797
Hey, you guys,

848
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,239
how come Mike and Harriet
haven't come back yet?

849
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,402
Uh-oh.

850
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,577
What's that?

851
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,359
I thought
I heard something.

852
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,396
Look, it's probably
only rats.

853
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,863
That ain't no rat.

854
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,958
Come on, let's go
find Mike and Harriet

855
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:42,163
and get out of here.

856
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,330
- Come on!
- Coming.

857
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,195
Tommy Whitcomb, what the hell's
the matter with you, anyway?

858
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,027
Where's your brains?
How many times have I told you--

859
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:13,034
Chief, listen to me.
You have to go to the mine.

860
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,196
We were having a party and Harry Warden
started killing everybody!

861
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,672
Harry Warden?

862
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,140
Harry Warden
is at the mine.

863
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,040
There's a bunch of kids
trapped down below.

864
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,204
Axel and TJ are
trying to get them out.

865
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,214
He killed Sylvia and Dave!

866
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,274
All right. Get back in that car
and get home and stay put.

867
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,411
Go on!

868
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,432
- Mobile One in.
- Go ahead, Chief.

869
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,228
Yeah, Ben, call
the mayor right away,

870
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,235
then round up
every available man.

871
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,567
Meet me back at the mine.

872
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,232
I think there's some kids
trapped down below.

873
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,707
Out.

874
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:56,572
Howard, would you
get up in front?

875
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,579
I'm trying to get
up in front!

876
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,081
- Ow!
- I can't even see.

877
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,118
- Watch your head.
- Just stay beside me.

878
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:06,086
- Okay.
- Michael!

879
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,452
Mike!

880
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,081
Why don't
they answer us?

881
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,319
- Stavinski!
- Mike!

882
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,589
We never should
have left them in the first place.

883
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,095
Maybe they're
down there.

884
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,597
- Jesus!
- TJ.

885
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,599
What the hell
are you trying to do?

886
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:19,827
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

887
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:22,894
Yeah, we're fine.
What's the matter with you?

888
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,269
We gotta get the hell
out of here.

889
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,205
Harry Warden is back.

890
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,436
He's killed Sylvia
and Dave up top.

891
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,775
Are you kidding?

892
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,212
Harry's dead.
Harry died a long time ago.

893
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,046
Will you shut up and listen to me,
goddamn it!

894
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:38,552
Now they're dead and
he's down here somewhere.

895
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,054
If you wanna get out
of here alive,

896
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,090
you do exactly
as I tell you.

897
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,490
What are we
gonna do?

898
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,188
This better not be
your idea of a joke, TJ.

899
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,198
Do I look
like I'm joking?

900
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,631
Come on.
Let's go.

901
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,362
Wait a minute.
Now what about Mike and Harriet?

902
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,530
Last time I saw them,
they were in the engine room.

903
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,197
You check the main shaft.

904
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,708
I'll take tunnel six
and meet you there.

905
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:03,643
Howard, you stay with the girls
and wait for Axel.

906
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,703
- Me?
- Stay with Howard.

907
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,408
- No, Hollis, please!
- Stay back!

908
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,781
Hollis!
Wait a minute!

909
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,715
Howard,
you watch the girls!

910
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:18,051
I don't even know
my way around.

911
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,220
Oh, shit.

912
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,595
Michael?

913
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,225
Harriet?

914
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:29,635
Michael and Harriet,
this isn't anytime to be doing anything.

915
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:22,110
Oh! Oh, Jesus!

916
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,180
No.

917
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,384
Oh, God, Hollis!

918
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,630
Oh, Hollis!

919
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:40,195
Oh, God, Hollis.

920
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,328
Oh.

921
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,429
Oh, it's not--

922
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,236
Oh, please, God.

923
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,244
Come on.
He's dead.

924
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,481
He's dead!
Come on!

925
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,649
- Come on!
- Patty, come on.

926
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,023
Come on, he's dead.
Now come on.

927
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,256
- Patty!
- No.

928
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,423
Howard, you bastard!

929
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,864
He's dead.
Now come on.

930
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,129
You can't leave us
like this!

931
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:19,831
Patty, please.
Help me.

932
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,102
No!

933
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:23,940
Leave him alone.

934
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:25,412
- Let go of me.
- No.

935
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,177
Patty, we need
the light, damn it!

936
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:39,153
Okay, come on, Patty.
Don't do this to me.

937
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,662
We have to
get out of here.

938
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,163
No!

939
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,358
Stop it!

940
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,263
Okay okay, come on.

941
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,179
Oh, my God.

942
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,680
Where are the others?

943
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:02,876
We saw him.
He was standing right there.

944
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,181
Harry Warden's
down here.

945
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:06,687
Come on, let's go.

946
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,848
- Come on.
- No!

947
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,186
Let's go!
Come on!

948
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,193
Where the hell is TJ?

949
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,695
He went looking
for Mike and Harriet.

950
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,788
He told us to stay here.

951
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,963
Now come on.
The cage is right up ahead.

952
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:22,969
Let's go!

953
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,472
Keep moving.
You're gonna be fine.

954
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,702
- Axel, please! No!
- Hold on.

955
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,609
Oh, let go of me.

956
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,204
I don't want to
leave him there.

957
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,375
- Shh. Shh.
- Let's go back and get him.

958
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,385
I don't want to--

959
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,717
oh, please,
Axel, no.

960
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,346
Patty, stop it!

961
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,220
I don't want to
leave him there.

962
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:46,227
You'll be fine.
You're gonna be just fine.

963
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,729
Oh, God, where
are you taking us?

964
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:51,493
Keep moving. We're almost there.
We're almost there.

965
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:54,263
Keep moving. You're doing fine.
You're doing fine.

966
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:55,325
That's it.

967
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,137
God, where are
we going?

968
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,743
I can't make it anymore.

969
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,745
Shut up.
Yes, you can.

970
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,041
Come on.
Let's go.

971
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,583
- I can't!
- Let's go.

972
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,784
Shit.

973
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,333
It's TJ.

974
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,806
Aw, shit!

975
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,281
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

976
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,783
I'm sorry, man.
I thought you were Harry.

977
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:45,285
Do I look like Harry?
Where's Howard?

978
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,948
- He ran off.
- Oh, that jerk!

979
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,957
He's never gonna
find his way out of here alone.

980
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,287
Hollis is dead.

981
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,796
Look, we gotta get Sarah
and Patty up top,

982
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,832
get some help and come
back for the others.

983
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,296
- Come on.
- Okay, let's go.

984
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,895
Come on. Come on.
Let's get going.

985
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,269
Okay.

986
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,516
Mobile One, come in.

987
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:59,425
Mobile One.

988
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,053
Come in, Mobile One.

989
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:08,201
Watch your step.

990
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,704
Okay.
I can't even see.

991
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:12,205
We're almost there.

992
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:13,866
Shh! Keep your
voices down.

993
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:15,876
- Come on.
- Shh!

994
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:16,876
Please, hurry.

995
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:18,810
Shh! Keep your
voices down.

996
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,833
He smashed
the control panel.

997
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,769
There's no way we're
getting out of here.

998
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,773
What?

999
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,741
What are we gonna do?

1000
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,177
Climb.

1001
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,908
- Come on.
- No.

1002
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,210
Come on.

1003
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,632
Watch your footing now.

1004
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,759
Axel, please slow down.

1005
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:15,564
Patty, you're okay.
I'm right behind you.

1006
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:17,161
Keep going.

1007
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,179
Come on. Come on.
Don't look down.

1008
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,738
Keep looking up.

1009
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:30,046
Patty, just do as he says,
and you'll be fine.

1010
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,642
I promise.

1011
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,125
I don't want to
go any further.

1012
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:43,187
Please, can we stop
and go another way?

1013
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,496
There's no other way.
Now move it, damn it!

1014
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,643
Axel, you'll
have to go slower.

1015
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,650
I'm right behind her.
She keeps stopping.

1016
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,345
Go slower, okay?

1017
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,121
Oh!

1018
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,996
I'm scared of heights,
you guys.

1019
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,659
I'm not going
any further.

1020
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:22,533
I'm stopping right here.

1021
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,299
Sarah, Sarah.
Give her a hand.

1022
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,037
Now I'm behind you.

1023
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:31,545
I'm right behind you.
Come on.

1024
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:34,047
Okay.
Okay. Stay close.

1025
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,516
Okay,
I'm right behind you.

1026
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,213
Attagirl.
Keep moving.

1027
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,187
Good girl.

1028
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,199
Come down.
Come down, quick. Down.

1029
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:19,787
Don't look.

1030
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,924
Don't look at him.
Come on.

1031
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,901
Patty, over here.

1032
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:33,107
Now he's up top.

1033
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,939
That bastard's really
playing games with us.

1034
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:38,878
We can beat him
if we can get to the rail cars.

1035
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:41,006
Then, come on.
I know a shortcut through the sump.

1036
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,209
It's over there.

1037
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,554
Watch your step.

1038
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:58,331
Come on.

1039
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,334
Come on. Come on.
Nice and slow.

1040
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,893
Let's go. Let's go.
Slowly.

1041
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,201
TJ, take the girls over

1042
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:07,207
and give me a yell
when you're across.

1043
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,539
Okay.

1044
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,010
Go.

1045
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,047
Watch your head.

1046
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:14,605
Watch your step.

1047
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,696
Okay.

1048
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,235
Okay, Axel, we're clear.
Come on over.

1049
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,368
Axel?

1050
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:41,669
Axel!

1051
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,753
TJ, do something.

1052
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,584
There's nothing
I can do.

1053
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,681
It's 60-feet deep.

1054
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,953
Gosh!

1055
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,587
We've got to
get out of here.

1056
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:03,255
We can't just
leave him here.

1057
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,764
Move it!

1058
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,267
It's too late
for Axel.

1059
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,768
Come on.

1060
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,786
Okay, you just hug along
the left side of the wall.

1061
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:36,297
Now just keep going.
Go on. Continue.

1062
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:39,333
- But why--
- Just do as he says.

1063
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,622
TJ?

1064
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:03,953
Answer us!

1065
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,127
TJ!

1066
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,633
- He's--
- Shh!

1067
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,135
Let's go this way.

1068
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,670
Come on. Go.

1069
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:31,179
Careful.

1070
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,591
Shh!

1071
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,164
Okay, there's gotta be
some way out of here.

1072
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,826
- Yeah.
- Come on, keep going.

1073
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,392
This way.

1074
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,167
Come on.

1075
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,370
Come on.

1076
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:51,131
- They're down there?
- Yeah.

1077
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:12,877
Sarah! Sarah!

1078
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:16,287
Oh, TJ.

1079
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,620
Thank God.

1080
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,286
Shh!

1081
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,026
Come on.

1082
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:39,975
TJ?

1083
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,278
It's okay.
I just got hit.

1084
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,181
Come on.
We've got to hurry.

1085
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,153
The elevator isn't working.

1086
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:58,563
We're gonna have
to go in this way. Let's go.

1087
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:19,748
Jump.

1088
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:12,901
TJ!

1089
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:27,851
All right, watch
this thing coming.

1090
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,136
Oh my God.

1091
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:59,378
Sarah, move it!

1092
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,648
Get in.
Get in!

1093
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:13,832
Watch out!

1094
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,616
Axel.

1095
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:11,659
Why?

1096
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,870
Go.

1097
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:35,381
Come on.

1098
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,152
He's in there.

1099
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,226
Are you two all right?

1100
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,487
It isn't Harry Warden.

1101
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,465
Yeah. I know, TJ.

1102
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:55,991
I got a call from Eastfield
late this evening.

1103
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,638
They said that Harry Warden
died five years ago.

1104
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,107
But then who is it?

1105
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:05,976
It's Axel.

1106
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:08,641
Oh my God.

1107
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,509
Okay.
Well, you...

1108
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:18,919
My God, it was
on Valentine's Day

1109
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:22,929
that Harry Warden
killed Axel's father.

1110
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:25,522
- Let's get in there.
- Yeah.

1111
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:42,346
Come on.
Let's get it off. Get it off.

1112
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,289
He's alive!

1113
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:58,898
- My God.
- Sarah!

1114
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,661
Oh, my God!
Oh!

1115
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,396
Sarah!

1116
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:09,637
TJ, I have to
see him.

1117
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:19,351
Axel.

1118
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:25,792
Why?

1119
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,560
Help me, please.

1120
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:50,081
Hanniger, I'll be waiting
in hell for you!

1121
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:53,086
Harry?
Harry, I'm coming.

1122
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:56,248
This whole fucking town
is going to die!

1123
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:58,952
We're coming back,
you bastards!

1124
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:05,128
Sarah, be my
bloody Valentine.

1125
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:11,895
## Daddy's gone away ##

1126
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:15,602
## Harry Warden
made you pay. ##

1127
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:26,916
## Once upon a time ##

1128
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:28,979
## On a sad Valentine ##

1129
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:33,322
## In a place known
as Hanniger Mine ##

1130
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:35,362
## A legend began ##

1131
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,694
## Every woman and man ##

1132
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:41,997
## Would always
remember the time ##

1133
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:44,162
## And those who remain ##

1134
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,830
## Were never the same ##

1135
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:50,640
## You could see
the fear in their eyes ##

1136
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:52,303
## Once every year ##

1137
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,439
## As the 14th draws near ##

1138
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:58,679
## There's a hush
all over the town ##

1139
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:00,880
## For the legend,
they say ##

1140
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:02,786
## On a Valentine's Day ##

1141
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:07,294
## Is a curse
that'll live on and on ##

1142
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:09,295
## And no one will know ##

1143
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:11,388
## As the years come and go ##

1144
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:15,766
## Of the horror
from long time ago ##

1145
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,473
## 20 years came and went ##

1146
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,272
## And everyone spent ##

1147
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:28,748
## The 14th in quiet regret ##

1148
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:30,647
## And those still alive ##

1149
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:32,879
## Know the secret survives ##

1150
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:37,220
## In the darkness
that looms in the night ##

1151
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,259
## For the legend, they say ##

1152
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,591
## On a Valentine's Day ##

1153
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:45,860
## Is a curse
that'll live on and on ##

1154
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:47,798
## And no one will know ##

1155
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:50,167
## As the years come and go ##

1156
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:54,470
## Of the horror
from long time ago ##

1157
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,476
## In this little town ##

1158
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,671
## When the 14th
comes round ##

1159
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:03,115
## There's a silence
and fear in the air ##

1160
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,152
## Remember the morn ##

1161
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,278
## That the legend was born ##

1162
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:11,553
## All the shock
and the horror was there ##

1163
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:13,617
## For the legend, they say ##

1164
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,889
## On a Valentine's Day ##

1165
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:20,229
## Is a curse
that'll live on and on ##

1166
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:22,462
## And no one will know ##

1167
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,528
## As the years come and go ##

1168
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:28,473
## Of the horror
from long time ago ##

1169
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:31,444
## And no one will know ##

1170
01:32:31,512 --> 01:32:34,572
## As the years come and go ##

1171
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:36,514
## Of the horror ##

1172
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:42,022
## From long time ago. ##
