1
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,480
No!

2
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,881
No!

3
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:04,192
Let me down!

4
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,316
Let me down!

5
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:09,005
It's snack time now.
Sit still

6
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,156
Hello. I am Ms Li

7
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,401
I'm the head teacher of this class.
And you are...

8
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:19,323
I am Qiang's father

9
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:22,836
What is your name?

10
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:25,116
Why are you crying?

11
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,761
Don't you like coming
to our kindergarten?

12
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,606
His name is Fang Qiangqiang

13
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,604
He's almost four

14
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,957
The principal said he could
join the intermediate class

15
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:38,603
He's been cared for by his granny,
but she is leaving

16
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:41,561
His mother works
for our ministry in another city

17
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:43,679
As a pilot,
I'm often away from home

18
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:46,561
So I'm putting Qiang
into a boarding kindergarten

19
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,805
He won't have to go home
on weekends

20
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,920
OK

21
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,165
All of the kids here
are 4 or 5 year-olds

22
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:56,282
There are two teachers
and two assistants

23
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,484
This is Ms Tang,
Ms Ma and Ms Fu are the assistants

24
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,398
Go play with the other kids.
Stop crying

25
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:19,320
Stop crying

26
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:23,171
<i>Old wolf, old wolf,
what time is it now?</i>

27
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,283
<i>Two o'clock</i>

28
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:30,249
<i>Old wolf, old wolf,
what time is it now?</i>

29
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:32,524
<i>Three o'clock</i>

30
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:36,090
<i>Old wolf, old wolf,
what time is it now?</i>

31
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,330
<i>Four o'clock</i>

32
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:41,252
Do you know
how this game is played?

33
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:48,611
Ms Li pretends to be a big wolf

34
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:51,375
All the kids pretend to be lambs

35
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:55,330
They follow the wolf and ask...

36
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,209
..."Old wolf, old wolf,
what time is it now?"

37
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,329
The wolf says, "One o'clock"

38
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:04,972
Then two and three, and so on

39
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:08,726
When it's nine o'clock at night...

40
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:13,886
...the wolf turns around,
catches a lamb and eats it

41
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:17,014
Nine o'clock

42
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:28,093
Come here, Qiang

43
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:31,017
Let me look at your pigtail

44
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:34,369
Who braided it for you?

45
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:38,617
Quickly! Catch him!
Fang Qiangqiang

46
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:08,500
Fang Qiangqiang,
stand up

47
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,854
It's neat and clean now

48
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:14,944
You won't grow head lice,
or get heat rash in the summer

49
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,659
This is for your own good

50
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,776
If you let us
cut off your pigtail...

51
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:22,578
...I'll reward you
with a little red flower

52
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,094
Don't move

53
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,829
Try to remember, raise your
right hand straight up for extra rice

54
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:26,221
Jin, you raised the wrong hand

55
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,991
This is your right hand

56
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:32,184
Raise your left hand
for extra soup

57
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:33,951
Watch me

58
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:37,383
Make a fist. Good

59
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:45,066
No talking during meal time

60
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,544
Don't stand up,
Fa! Raise your hand. What is it?

61
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,791
- I want to pee
- Pee?

62
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:55,588
This means you didn't pee
before washing your hands

63
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,752
You must form the habit
of peeing before eating

64
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,754
I won't allow any peeing or pooping
in the middle of a meal

65
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,265
I'll take away one
of your red flowers

66
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:08,072
Take it out. Quickly.
Give it to me

67
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:05,072
Why aren't you taking
off your clothes?

68
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:35,717
Nanyan, Qiang doesn't know
how to take off his clothes

69
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,329
It's your turn now

70
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:21,126
Don't cry

71
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:24,374
Nanyan,
go back to your bed

72
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:54,305
Get up!

73
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,663
Stand up, Hai

74
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,989
Listen, if you disobey me
I'll take away your red flowers.

75
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,501
- Did you hear me?
- Qiang wetted his bed

76
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,422
Stand straight

77
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:44,151
What are you two doing?
Put on your clothes. Quickly

78
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:03,632
1, 2, 3. Squat down

79
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,870
Who is still talking?

80
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:16,066
Listen to me

81
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,907
You must form the good habit
of pooping every morning...

82
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:26,794
...to excrete the dirty things
in your body from the day before

83
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,670
And parasites
won't grow in your tummy

84
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:31,788
I know

85
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:37,716
Qian is finished. Ms Li,
Qian succeeded at pooping again

86
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:40,672
Good girl, Qian. You've done it
for a whole week now

87
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:21,153
Qiang, what's the matter?
Have you finished pooping?

88
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:25,242
- I can't do it
- Then forget it

89
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,355
Get up to wash your hands

90
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:29,714
Will I lose my little red flower?

91
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:33,519
Your little red flower?
Not this time

92
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:36,397
But you must promise me that
you'll produce some poop next time

93
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,833
And I'll reward you
a little red flower

94
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:43,965
Raise your hands after washing them

95
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:47,242
Line up

96
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:54,235
The first line-up can go now

97
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,527
Ms Li, Qiang didn't wash his hands

98
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:15,243
For that you'll lose
your red flower today

99
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,283
Whoever receives five flowers
each day, for a whole week...

100
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,639
...will be next week's
class leader

101
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,888
Let's see who have received
little red flowers today

102
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,842
Qian, five flowers

103
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,924
Mao, four

104
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,401
Hai, one

105
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,726
Jin, three

106
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:48,968
Fa, three

107
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:52,092
No flowers for Ning and Dou...

108
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:57,162
...because Ning
bullied a classmate again

109
00:15:57,293 --> 00:16:02,003
Dou, you must learn to dress yourself,
and wash your hands. OK?

110
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:06,206
We'll all keep working hard

111
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,565
What is it, Qiang?

112
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:11,084
Why haven't I received
any flowers?

113
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:13,934
Because you wetted
your bed again last night

114
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,727
You didn't dress yourself
this morning...

115
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,130
...or wash your hands
after going to the toilet

116
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:20,052
So you don't get any flowers

117
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:21,972
Nobody told me that.
It doesn't count

118
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:28,013
All right, I'll give you a flower
if you behave yourself tomorrow

119
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:32,415
Also, next time you have
a question raise your hand first...

120
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,528
...and then stand up

121
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:36,648
Sit down now

122
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:41,170
Qian has received five flowers again

123
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,289
You must emulate her

124
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:46,774
There are five opportunities everyday
to compete for little red flowers

125
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:50,050
Those who don't wet their beds,
dress and undress by themselves...

126
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,728
...wash their hands before meals,
go to the toilet on schedule...

127
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:56,327
...and do not talk at bedtime
will receive a little red flower...

128
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,770
...for each good behaviour,
plus one at his name on this board

129
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,858
Those who receive five flowers
everyday for a whole week...

130
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,133
Excellent!

131
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,421
I've got five flowers too

132
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:04,380
<i>Put on your little shirt</i>

133
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:08,295
<i>Put on your little shirt</i>

134
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:11,624
<i>Match each button for its hole</i>

135
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:15,457
<i>Match each button for its hole</i>

136
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:18,944
<i>Left shoe, right shoe</i>

137
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:22,345
<i>Left shoe, right shoe</i>

138
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,302
<i>Buckle up and you can go</i>

139
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,899
<i>Buckle up and you can go</i>

140
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:32,021
Good.
Put your hands behind your back

141
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,664
Please sit down

142
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,903
Who wants to come up
and demonstrate the moves?

143
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:45,628
Beiyan. Hai. Maomao

144
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:51,939
Come over.
Ready? Go!

145
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:56,385
<i>Put on your little shirt</i>

146
00:18:56,513 --> 00:19:00,745
<i>Match each button for its hole</i>

147
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:05,151
<i>Turn a pullover upside down</i>

148
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:09,983
<i>And back to front
before pulling it on</i>

149
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:14,153
<i>Distinguish back and front
of your trousers</i>

150
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:18,393
<i>Extend one leg in each trunk</i>

151
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:22,952
<i>No left or right for socks</i>

152
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:27,114
<i>Only the heels
must be on the bottom</i>

153
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:31,593
<i>Left shoe, right shoe</i>

154
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:35,755
<i>Buckle up and you can go</i>

155
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:38,755
Very good.
Please go back to your seats

156
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:47,546
Most children
can dress themselves now

157
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:50,033
Who still can't do it?

158
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,550
Stand still

159
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,794
Stick out your chest
and raise your head

160
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,354
Hold your fingers tight.
Well done

161
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,119
You see, anything can be learnt

162
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,075
Now turn around
and face the class

163
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,399
Who helped you get dressed
this morning?

164
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:23,872
Did you do it on your own?

165
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,753
Answer your teacher's question
with vocal sounds

166
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:28,918
- No, I didn't
- Who helped you?

167
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,953
- Ms Zhang
- Louder

168
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:33,471
Ms Zhang

169
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:36,640
Why must we learn
to dress ourselves?

170
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:39,756
I will choose someone to come up
and answer me

171
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,601
Qian

172
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,363
Children should learn
to dress themselves

173
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,873
Did you hear that?

174
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:51,838
There are only four or five children
left who cannot dress themselves

175
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:54,479
For those who can,
what should we do?

176
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:58,280
Help them!

177
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:03,161
Let's help them, shall we?

178
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:04,878
Yes!

179
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:08,123
Who will volunteer to demonstrate?
Raise your hand

180
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:13,166
Qian, you do it

181
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,598
Come over

182
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:56,408
Don't take off your underwear.
Go to Ms Ma

183
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:03,644
Qiang, come over.
Did you see it?

184
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,162
Practice now

185
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:43,725
Just keep dawdling.
No one will help you

186
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:47,213
You can get off
when you've mastered the skill

187
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,577
I dressed myself this morning

188
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,820
I strained to poop,
and washed my own hands

189
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,171
Why can't I get a little red flower?

190
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:27,577
Qiang has made progress today

191
00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:31,490
Why don't we give him
a little red flower?

192
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,500
No, we mustn't pamper him

193
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:39,491
Qiang, you must continue
with your effort and obey the teachers

194
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:50,612
- Ms Li, Qiang is peeing
- Sit down

195
00:23:56,784 --> 00:24:01,575
- I can't hold my pee either
- Go to the toilet

196
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:46,139
I will report you to the teachers

197
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,260
Creep!

198
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:52,865
Teacher! Teacher!

199
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:58,661
Teacher! Teacher!

200
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:19,307
Get off your bed

201
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,947
Follow me

202
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,625
Stand here

203
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:59,076
Do you dare to climb up this chair?

204
00:25:59,198 --> 00:26:01,792
Of course

205
00:26:07,118 --> 00:26:09,678
Can you climb any further?

206
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:35,039
Let me down!

207
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,801
Let me down!

208
00:26:58,244 --> 00:27:01,156
Let me down!

209
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:09,443
Get down!
How did you get up there?

210
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,959
Get down!
Did you hear me?

211
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:16,681
You brat!

212
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,638
Quiet!

213
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,041
How did you get over here?

214
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:39,763
Did you fly from the window
to the bed?

215
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:41,925
- Yes
- Yes

216
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,768
- Yes
- Yes

217
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:07,654
Nanyan, I saw with my own eyes
that you hit Beiyan

218
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:11,691
You lied and talked back to me

219
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:14,616
What a pair of sisters.
Helping each other out

220
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:16,854
Fine. Stop crying

221
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:20,016
You will each lose a little red flower

222
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,017
Nanyan...

223
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,574
Did you come to laugh at us?

224
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,895
I want to show you something

225
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:43,737
What?

226
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:46,456
I want to show you something

227
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:58,134
A little red flower?

228
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:02,176
- Did you steal it from Ms Li?
- No

229
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:05,852
Since Ms Li has taken
one away from you...

230
00:30:05,983 --> 00:30:08,782
...I want to give this one to you

231
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:11,180
I don't want it

232
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:19,574
<i>First net goes empty</i>

233
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:22,378
<i>Second net comes with small fish</i>

234
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:28,616
<i>Third net catches a fish
with a tiny, tiny, tiny, tail</i>

235
00:30:31,227 --> 00:30:33,422
<i>First net goes empty</i>

236
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:35,538
<i>Second net comes with small fish</i>

237
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,942
<i>Third net catches a fish
with a tiny, tiny, tiny, tail...</i>

238
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:49,940
Ms Li, this is Hai's father.
He's come to take Hai home

239
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:52,060
Hey, son!

240
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:54,180
Let me introduce you two

241
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:56,584
This is Ms Li,
head teacher of Hai's class

242
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,506
- How do you do
- How do you do

243
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:00,780
It's still two hours
from pick-up time

244
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:07,258
Hai's father is the Deputy Minister
of Logistics in our ministry

245
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,187
He is very busy

246
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,384
He has some free time today
to pick up his son on his way home

247
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:19,307
It's quite an honour for us to welcome
Minister Wang to inspect our work

248
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:21,423
How do you do,
Minister Wang

249
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:23,588
Hai must have caused you
a lot of trouble

250
00:31:23,712 --> 00:31:28,502
Not at all. Hai is very well-behaved.
He is smart and quick-witted

251
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:41,945
Did you make this evaluation board?

252
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,871
Oh, yes. They...

253
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:46,508
Ms Tang
is in charge of the pictures

254
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:50,468
Well done.
Wow, you are so young. Excellent

255
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:52,712
So many talents
in this kindergarten

256
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,872
Principal Kong
must be a good manager

257
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,715
- Not at all
- With diligent teachers

258
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:08,789
Hai, it appears
that you are just mediocre

259
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:13,036
He's been very well-behaved lately.
Very well-behaved

260
00:32:15,078 --> 00:32:18,593
What's the matter with this child?
He hasn't got any little red flowers

261
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:21,835
- You must help him
- Yes, of course

262
00:32:22,878 --> 00:32:26,588
We haven't evaluated today.
They'll each receive one

263
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,197
Dad, I want to wear
trousers with braces

264
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,310
Just carry on as usual

265
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:34,795
- Don't spoil him
- Yes, sir

266
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,476
This is from my dad.
You can't touch it

267
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,560
May I have a look?

268
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:49,397
This is a grown-up's thing.
Don't touch it

269
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:53,393
Can't I just have a look?

270
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,319
All right

271
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:33,676
Thank you, Qiang

272
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:24,042
- I want to play with you
- Sissy! Traitor!

273
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,849
Can I hold it?

274
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,615
Let me touch it

275
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:09,287
Freak!

276
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,614
Come on! Let's catch small fish

277
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:29,544
There are fish in it

278
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:32,020
I can't catch them

279
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,979
There are some over there too

280
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,096
Come here

281
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:43,736
Freak!

282
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,381
Beiyan, can I play with you?

283
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,102
It's been a while since
anyone played with you

284
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:04,025
- All right
- Let me push you

285
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:06,139
OK

286
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:10,140
- High up?
- A little

287
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:14,865
- Is it high enough?
- No more

288
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,624
- Is it fun?
- Yes

289
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,503
- But not so high
- Is it fast?

290
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,666
Yes. But not so high

291
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,181
- You must swing high up
- Yes, but not so high

292
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:32,826
- Shall we play another game?
- OK

293
00:37:33,992 --> 00:37:36,950
- Let's pretend you are injured
- OK

294
00:37:55,554 --> 00:37:58,705
I'm sick.
Give me some medicine

295
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:01,667
- Where do I find medicine?
- Let me see

296
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:08,792
- We'll use these buttons as pills
- OK

297
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:11,510
- Feed them to me
- All right

298
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:18,229
- Can I give you an injection?
- Yes

299
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,475
What are you doing?
Shameless!

300
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,233
Come here

301
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:54,757
Are you stupid?
Letting a boy take off your trousers!

302
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:59,274
Qiang, stand against the wall

303
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:04,837
Remember, don't ever let
any boy take off your trousers

304
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:18,554
Halt!
Turn around!

305
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:21,243
March!

306
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:27,355
Attention!

307
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:29,281
Salute!

308
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:31,201
At ease!

309
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:33,121
Salute!

310
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:35,042
At ease!

311
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,407
Get up, Qiang

312
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,998
One more offence
and I'll put you in confinement

313
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,722
- Did you hear me?
- Yes

314
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,922
Stand up. Hurry

315
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:30,168
What are you doing, Qiang?
No talking, no standing up

316
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:12,114
Please stop following me.
You are something else

317
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:15,790
Do you know what you've done?

318
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:22,156
- A monster chased me in the water
- Where is the monster now?

319
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:24,842
I flushed it away with my pee

320
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:12,806
- King of bed-wetting!
- You are the king of bed-wetting

321
00:46:15,728 --> 00:46:18,800
Bravo, Qiang

322
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:24,839
Good morning, Ms Tang

323
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:28,680
Really smart

324
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:34,169
Put the train in the tunnel

325
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,121
Good

326
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,205
You are so capable

327
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:50,848
Put on your shoes

328
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:53,405
The seventh moves

329
00:46:53,531 --> 00:46:55,044
Ready. Go

330
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:57,527
One, two, three, four...

331
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,882
...five, six, seven, eight

332
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:02,162
Two, two, three, four...

333
00:47:02,293 --> 00:47:04,648
...five, six, seven, stop

334
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:06,572
OK, get in

335
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:09,048
The eighth moves.
Ready. Go

336
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:11,164
One, two, three, four...

337
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:14,842
...five, six, seven, eight.
Two, two, three, four...

338
00:47:14,973 --> 00:47:18,125
...five, six, seven, stop.
Good. Discharged

339
00:47:27,455 --> 00:47:29,446
- Freak!
- Freak!

340
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:11,138
What are you staring at me for?

341
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,336
What are you staring at me for?
I'm asking you

342
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:34,340
Stop crying

343
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:43,859
Eat your breakfast

344
00:48:52,824 --> 00:48:57,102
- Why is he crying?
- He knows why

345
00:49:07,506 --> 00:49:10,862
<i>I hand out apples to my friends
only two are left in the end</i>

346
00:49:10,986 --> 00:49:13,864
<i>A big one and a small one,
a big one and a small one</i>

347
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:18,742
<i>The big one goes to a friend
and I'm left with the small one</i>

348
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:21,461
<i>I'm left with the small one...</i>

349
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:28,619
Ms Li, Ning is fighting

350
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:31,023
Ning!

351
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:35,825
I'm warning you,
stop bullying your classmate

352
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:38,179
Return to your seat

353
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:55,105
Let's sing the song again

354
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:01,420
Ready. Go

355
00:50:07,152 --> 00:50:09,906
Who was it? Who farted?

356
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:14,230
Stand up!
Stick your bottoms up

357
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,504
Don't laugh

358
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:36,184
Ms Ma...

359
00:50:36,315 --> 00:50:39,352
Qiang and Nanyan

360
00:50:39,475 --> 00:50:41,751
Go to the toilet

361
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:43,867
Nanyan, go

362
00:50:43,996 --> 00:50:46,352
Go now to the toilet

363
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:52,674
The rest of you, sit still

364
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:17,599
Call me after you've pooped

365
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:06,397
You stink.
Don't come near me

366
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:15,880
<i>I hand out apples to my friends
only two are left in the end</i>

367
00:52:16,006 --> 00:52:19,043
<i>A big one and a small one</i>

368
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:21,396
<i>A big one and a small one</i>

369
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:27,636
<i>The big one goes to a friend
and I'm left with the small one...</i>

370
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,477
No, no, it's not like that

371
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:38,877
<i>The big one goes to myself,
and the small one to my friend</i>

372
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:44,803
The big one goes to myself,
and the small one to my friend

373
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,726
Stinker!

374
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:53,370
The big one goes to myself,
and the small one to my friend

375
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,481
Stinker!

376
00:53:19,693 --> 00:53:23,163
<i>Eating radish and veggles</i>

377
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:25,761
<i>Jumping around like a cutie pie</i>

378
00:53:25,893 --> 00:53:31,173
<i>Riding my little white horse</i>

379
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:37,053
<i>Little white bunny, oh, so white</i>

380
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:39,735
<i>Two little ears stick up right</i>

381
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:42,847
<i>Little white bunny, oh, so white...</i>

382
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:46,006
Come on!

383
00:53:54,296 --> 00:53:56,288
Wrong tunnel!

384
00:53:57,177 --> 00:54:01,170
Ms Li has abandoned us all
because you stink too much

385
00:54:01,297 --> 00:54:03,606
Let's go out and play

386
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:06,093
Come on!

387
00:54:53,902 --> 00:54:56,258
I'm tired

388
00:54:56,383 --> 00:54:59,376
Stop running!

389
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:33,215
- Salute!
- Salute!

390
00:55:48,749 --> 00:55:50,944
There are nicer flowers over here

391
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:07,066
Hospital!

392
00:56:34,753 --> 00:56:39,464
I want to be sick
so I can stay out of the kindergarten

393
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:41,903
I can eat yummy things

394
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:44,788
Mum and dad will come and see me

395
00:56:44,915 --> 00:56:47,873
Let's play the game of sick patients

396
00:56:47,995 --> 00:56:49,792
Let me ask you...

397
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:52,110
...would you follow me wherever I go?

398
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:54,227
OK

399
00:56:55,276 --> 00:56:59,633
You have to be hygienic
when you are sick

400
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:09,149
What are you doing?
I don't like it when you kiss my ear

401
00:57:09,277 --> 00:57:11,667
Let's run around

402
00:57:20,558 --> 00:57:23,675
What animal was Nanyan imitating?
Don't speak

403
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:26,267
Raise your hand

404
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,595
- Pang
- A peacock

405
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,429
Now let me imitate an animal,
and you guess what it is

406
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,313
All right? Watch me

407
00:57:54,162 --> 00:57:57,711
Ms Li has turned into a monster

408
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,962
Let me tell you a big secret

409
00:58:11,084 --> 00:58:13,598
You weren't born by your mum

410
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,999
It's you who wasn't born by humans

411
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:21,074
Remember,
Ms Li has eaten your sister

412
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:15,482
- I'm not one, right?
- No

413
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:25,444
- Do I have a tail?
- No

414
00:59:25,572 --> 00:59:28,928
Neither of us has a tail

415
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:32,125
What if Ms Li only eats children?

416
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:37,364
Stand still

417
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:50,971
Stand still. She can turn everything
into anything she wishes

418
00:59:51,094 --> 00:59:56,806
- Does she like eating children?
- Definitely

419
00:59:56,935 --> 01:00:01,134
Qian must be a little monster
created by Ms Li

420
01:00:01,256 --> 01:00:04,805
Does Qian have hair in her armpits?

421
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:07,814
They have hidden their hair

422
01:00:09,056 --> 01:00:15,007
- Will Ms Li eat us?
- Definitely

423
01:00:25,858 --> 01:00:29,134
I can turn into a girl

424
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,129
- Why did you touch my bum?
- To see if you have a tail

425
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,250
- Why did you touch my bum?
- To see if you have a tail

426
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,013
Neither do you

427
01:02:36,232 --> 01:02:42,069
May I hide under your bed?
I'm afraid Ms Li might eat me

428
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,990
OK

429
01:02:56,954 --> 01:03:04,067
- Can the two of us defeat Ms Li?
- I don't know

430
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:10,465
- Let's try
- No. Let's not

431
01:03:10,596 --> 01:03:14,475
All of us put together
cannot defeat Ms Li

432
01:03:24,758 --> 01:03:27,033
Where are you going?

433
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:32,835
- I want to look at Ms Li
- Don't. She'll eat you

434
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:38,670
I want to see what she looks
like as a monster

435
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,677
Quieter!

436
01:04:45,246 --> 01:04:49,081
Let's tie her up
so she won't be able to eat us

437
01:04:49,207 --> 01:04:51,596
- What with?
- With a rope

438
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:54,002
- I've got shoestrings
- They're too short

439
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:57,642
I also have shoestrings.
We can tie them together

440
01:04:57,767 --> 01:05:00,918
Let's look for other things

441
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:37,697
Monster!

442
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:53,495
What are you doing?

443
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,616
What's going on?
What happened?

444
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:12,133
- Ms Li, what happened?
- I don't know

445
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,571
- What's going on?
- Tell me

446
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:18,537
Yes?
Tell me what happened

447
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:22,099
Monster?
What monster?

448
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,538
Monsters are made up
to scare little kids

449
01:07:25,663 --> 01:07:27,813
- Don't cry. Speak to me
- Speak, Maomao

450
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,740
Yes, speak to me

451
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:33,823
Tell me, who is the monster?

452
01:07:40,425 --> 01:07:44,134
What? I am a monster?
Says who?

453
01:07:44,265 --> 01:07:46,381
- Who is making it up?
- Ms Li...

454
01:07:46,505 --> 01:07:49,497
- Who is the rumourmonger?
- Calm down

455
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:53,096
Tell me who told you so?

456
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,899
Stand up, Jin

457
01:08:01,867 --> 01:08:05,576
- It's you. Get out!
- Ms Li!

458
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:17,621
Bang! Bang!

459
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,752
Go away

460
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:23,483
- I'm not scared of you
- Nor I of you

461
01:10:46,405 --> 01:10:48,600
Creep!

462
01:10:56,846 --> 01:11:01,317
Get out, Qiang!

463
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:14,601
We are playing a game

464
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,798
Remember, wolves are bad

465
01:11:16,928 --> 01:11:20,204
Run away when you see one
to avoid being eaten

466
01:11:20,328 --> 01:11:22,762
That's not right.
We should kill the wolf

467
01:11:22,888 --> 01:11:25,197
You dare to refute me?

468
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,881
What is it?

469
01:11:50,332 --> 01:11:54,883
- Who bullied you?
- They hit me!

470
01:11:58,972 --> 01:12:02,089
You three are the black
sheep in our class

471
01:12:03,332 --> 01:12:05,801
You are the ringleader

472
01:12:05,933 --> 01:12:07,924
You are the go-getter

473
01:12:08,053 --> 01:12:11,524
You are the evilest of all.
A villainous conspirator

474
01:12:11,654 --> 01:12:13,804
All the bad ideas
come from you

475
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:18,805
You're giving me a nasty look?

476
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:22,172
Come again?

477
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:24,092
Come again!

478
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,285
I dare you!

479
01:12:26,415 --> 01:12:28,406
You deserve a good beating

480
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:32,006
Your parents are too lenient with you
and you become a troublemaker

481
01:12:32,136 --> 01:12:35,446
You'll end up in the hands of
the police if you go on like this

482
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:44,368
You are too timid

483
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:50,050
If you keep quiet when others
bully you they'll step all over you

484
01:12:50,177 --> 01:12:54,570
Next time someone bullies you
report them to a teacher right away

485
01:12:57,979 --> 01:13:01,813
The three of you apologise
to Mao one by one

486
01:13:01,939 --> 01:13:03,975
Starting with Ning

487
01:13:04,099 --> 01:13:06,567
I was wrong
and I'll never do it again

488
01:13:06,699 --> 01:13:09,497
Say you are sorry.
Didn't your parents teach you?

489
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:12,931
- I'm sorry
- Go away

490
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:15,650
Mao...

491
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:17,772
Did I call you?

492
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:25,969
- Hai
- I'm sorry. I'll never do it again

493
01:13:29,382 --> 01:13:31,373
Fang Qiangqiang

494
01:13:33,023 --> 01:13:35,014
Fang Qiangqiang

495
01:13:39,823 --> 01:13:42,815
- Fang Qiangqiang!
- Sugar bun

496
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:47,543
- What did you call me?
- Fuck you!

497
01:13:53,104 --> 01:13:54,857
- No!
- Let's go!

498
01:13:55,785 --> 01:13:57,582
No!

499
01:13:57,705 --> 01:14:00,981
Get up! Get in!

500
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:03,495
Call me when
you've decided to be good

501
01:14:06,906 --> 01:14:10,182
Open the door!

502
01:14:29,148 --> 01:14:31,946
Who are you?

503
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:58,387
Principal Kong,
come and rescue me

504
01:14:58,512 --> 01:15:01,549
A monster is about to eat me

505
01:15:01,672 --> 01:15:04,345
I was wrong

506
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:37,234
- Who taught you that dirty word?
- Nobody

507
01:15:37,355 --> 01:15:39,347
There must have been somebody

508
01:15:39,476 --> 01:15:41,865
Nobody in this kindergarten says it

509
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:44,591
What a rude word.
Do you know what it means?

510
01:15:44,717 --> 01:15:47,515
- I said nobody taught me!
- What kind of attitude is this?

511
01:15:47,637 --> 01:15:49,787
You are in the kindergarten
and must obey the rules

512
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,953
Don't contradict the Principal!

513
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:54,068
I don't want to go to kindergarten.
I want to go to school

514
01:15:54,197 --> 01:16:00,547
I wouldn't regard leaving
the kindergarten as a happy event

515
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:04,752
This is happiest,
the most carefree time of your life

516
01:16:04,879 --> 01:16:08,474
You can never come back to it

517
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:14,835
You'll understand it
when you grow up.

518
01:16:15,559 --> 01:16:18,233
All right?

519
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,919
Put Qiang in solitary confinement

520
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,839
He cannot talk to any classmate
without permission, and vice versa

521
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:31,952
Isolate him

522
01:17:32,768 --> 01:17:35,646
Qiang hit me

523
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:39,759
I've told you to ignore him.
Return to your position

524
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:43,648
Listen carefully,
Qiang has been disobedient

525
01:17:43,769 --> 01:17:46,079
You are not allowed to pay
any attention to him

526
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:07,361
Beiyan, why are you crying?

527
01:18:07,492 --> 01:18:09,483
What's wrong?

528
01:18:10,372 --> 01:18:15,083
Now, now, don't cry.
Go back to sleep

529
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,337
Why are you smiling at me?

530
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:20,768
Who smiled at you?

531
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:22,891
How shameless you are!

532
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,819
I'm laughing at a dog!

533
01:22:00,837 --> 01:22:04,716
From now on
you are allowed to join the others

534
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:27,911
Follow tightly

535
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:40,157
I'm out of line.
Report me to the teachers!
