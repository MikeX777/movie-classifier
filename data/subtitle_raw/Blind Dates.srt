BLIND DATES

00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,593
That is her.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,271
But she is alone.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,392
That is her.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,432
lali?  - Yes.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,995
I am Iva

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,355
I'm pleased.  - This is Sandro.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,873
My pleasure.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,832
Sorry we are late

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,672
We waited upstairs.  - Everything OK.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,193
I have only just arrived.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,358
Where is Maka?

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,035
Maka didn't come.  - Why not?

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,155
I don't know,

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,639
she didn't come to the station

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,875
I called her

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,075
but she didn't answer.

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,514
Then my cell phone went off.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,398
I didn't know what I should do,

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,913
so i came alone.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,675
Maybe she has

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,313
took the next bus.

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,155
We can wait, I don't know.

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,638
Call her from my cell phone.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,233
Maybe she'll answer.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,836
Are you sure it's her?

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,878
In the photo she sent,

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,393
she had a different hairstyle.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,189
I don't like this online thing.

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,595
Do you have an alternative

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,512
Do you have?

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,909
She was't feel well and

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,433
she couldn't come.

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,078
We can meet another time.

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,150
Your decision.

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,231
No why?  What you can get today

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,799
don't put that off for tomorrow.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,638
Let's go.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,512
I have to go.

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,835
Aren't you coming?

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,070
No, I had an unexpected call

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,789
I have to go.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,188
But I'll leave you

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,793
in very good hands.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,431
Can I talk to you for a minute

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,077
Hi.  are you Tamilla  - Yes.

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,033
I am a friend of Iva.

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,713
He reserved two rooms.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,790
Where is Iva?

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,315
You should have come an hour ago.

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,431
Yes we are late

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,152
We don't need both rooms.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,469
Iva can't come.

60
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,029
Why?

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,837
I don't know.  He can not.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,309
Then who pays for the second room?

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,793
Probably Iva.  He'll call later.

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,234
Do you know where the room is?  - No.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,395
Third floor, down the hall.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,353
Thank you.

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,039
Let's go?

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,551
Do you want to drink something?  - No thank you.

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,430
Some fruit?  - No thank you.

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,949
Should I switch?  - Up to you.

71
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,390
Maybe some water?

72
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,989
Yes.

73
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,278
Thank you.

74
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,957
A bit more?  - Yes.

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,956
Do you work anywhere in Gori?

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,872
I am a nurse.

77
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,999
And you?  - I am a teacher.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,592
And in your free time

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,472
you come with women to this hotel?

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,509
No.

81
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,028
Actually, this is my first time here.

82
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,114
Oh yes?  - Yes.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,673
And Iva?  - What about Iva?

84
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,910
Has he been here?

85
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,749
I don't know.  Probably yes.

86
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,520
Have you known Iva for a long time?  - Yes.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,195
Since my childhood.

88
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,032
We grew up together.

89
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,355
He was a soccer player, right?

90
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,710
Yes, he was a good player.

91
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,312
He even played for

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,596
Tbilisi Dinamos B Team.

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,917
Then he stopped.

94
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,399
I persuaded him

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,676
to work as a coach at our school.

96
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,997
He agreed because of the long vacation.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,959
The salary is low

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,712
but the holidays are long.

99
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,958
Also, the kids love him.

100
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,711
What's happening?  - Nothing.

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,551
Any more water?

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,518
What are you doing there?

103
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,316
What?

104
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,553
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,471
It's already OK.  - Excuse me.

106
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,276
It's okay.

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,756
Are you feeling better?

108
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,875
I don't believe you.

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,109
Smile at me.

110
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,028
Yes.

111
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,271
Which posters?

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,035
They're in the car.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,754
Fine, I'll bring her.  OK.

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,997
Would you like to see a football game?

115
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,195
at the stadium?

116
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,759
I don't like football.

117
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,876
Not the usual football.

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,435
Women's football?

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,235
Girls don't play football in Gori.

120
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,719
In Tbilisi they do.

121
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,955
Manana, give me the poster.

122
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,439
The rattle too.

123
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,598
Stand next to me

124
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,318
Manana is your conductor.  It's simple.

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,515
The posters work

126
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,591
if you pick them up at the same time.

127
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,432
When our girls attack

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,589
you lift her up.

129
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,153
Take them down

130
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,639
If they score a goal.

131
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,153
Shake the rattles.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,638
Again please.

133
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,953
Please collect the posters

134
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,395
after the game again, yes?

135
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,832
You look great.  - Thank you.

136
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,199
When the headmistress

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,793
speech is finished, pick it up.

138
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,871
Iva!  - I'm coming.

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,397
As you know,

140
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,668
women's football is

141
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,195
a new sport in our country.

142
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,035
Until recently, only men played.

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,318
But times are changing.

144
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,708
The role of women in

145
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,552
of society as well.

146
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,673
We become more active

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,833
energetic, ambitious and mobile.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,755
We want to score more goals in life.

149
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,354
I hate it,

150
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,238
to leave my child alone.

151
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,038
How old is your child?  - 13

152
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,160
A boy or a girl?  - A boy.

153
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,511
Where is his father  - In Gori.

154
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,352
What's his occupation?

155
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,353
Nothing.  He drinks and

156
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,158
then goes crazy.

157
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,996
Are you divorced?

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,788
Yes, for two years.

159
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,149
It's impossible to live with him.

160
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,189
He smashes everything.

161
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,392
He hit me.

162
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,034
Last time he came by

163
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,679
and ruined everything.

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,752
He cut himself in one piece

165
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,433
glass and bleeding everywhere.

166
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,351
My son was scared.

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,036
The bus to Gori departs.

168
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,919
The bus to Gori is about to leave.

169
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,396
I can come next Friday.

170
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,834
Do you want me to come?

171
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,635
Yes, of course.  - Do you work on Friday?

172
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,917
I work until 1:40 p.m.

173
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,679
Should I come at three?

174
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,273
I'll bring Maka too.

175
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,557
That would be nice.

176
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,833
Is he drunk?

177
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,752
I don't think so.

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,799
I am not drunk.

179
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,871
You are not?  Good for you.

180
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,712
Where have you been so long?  - He says nothing.

181
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,272
At school.

182
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,077
Our girls team had a game.

183
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,789
A famous Polish

184
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,279
Soccer player was there.

185
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,998
A woman?  - Yes.

186
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,793
Does she look good?

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,074
I don't like

188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,118
muscular soccer players.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,991
Don't mention her in front of me.

190
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,958
Marina's son married a Polish woman

191
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,953
and she turned out great.

192
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,115
Does she play football?

193
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,275
No, she is a doctor.

194
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,589
A doctor is good.

195
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,432
But will he marry a doctor?

196
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,272
He just roams around all day.

197
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,755
I don't stray.  - Yes, you do.

198
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,035
I have met a woman

199
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,235
today at the stadium.

200
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,674
Is she polish?

201
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,873
No, she is from Gori.

202
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,152
Why do you meet women from Gori?

203
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,311
Why is it important where she comes from?

204
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,435
It is important.

205
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,631
You were from the provinces too

206
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,199
when dad married you/

207
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,430
Was that a problem?  - Yes it was.

208
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,079
I had to teach her everything.

209
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,673
It was probably the other way around.

210
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,400
I taught you table manners.

211
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,516
How to use a fork.

212
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,789
No comment.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,956
What is this woman doing in the stadium?

214
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,951
She wanted to watch the game.

215
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,076
What?  - She watched the game.

216
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,992
She came specially from Gori,

217
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,149
to get in and

218
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,675
watch girls soccer game?

219
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,917
Is she crazy?

220
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,350
She wasn't there just for the game.

221
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,475
Why then?

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,437
She came to meet someone.

223
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,798
Did she go back?

224
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,349
Yes.  - Did you accompany her to say goodbye?

225
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,034
Yes.  - Is she coming back?

226
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,196
We will see.  Perhaps.

227
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,635
And if so, will you see her?

228
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,269
Probably.

229
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,954
He just says maybe

230
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,314
probably.

231
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,318
We will see.

232
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,392
Do something my son.

233
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,433
We are getting old.

234
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,950
He's getting old too.  He's already 40.

235
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,479
Did you park the car

236
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,070
Yes, at the marketplace.

237
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,875
Not in the garage?

238
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,156
I'll put it in the garage tomorrow.

239
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,310
We'll get a ticket.

240
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,238
Again.  - I'll pay it.

241
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,435
You never do.

242
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,794
I'm paying all the time.

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,951
I'll pay this time.  - You will?

244
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,519
When get my salary and pay.

245
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,352
I have never seen your salary.

246
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,199
Who would have thought,

247
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,749
that you're still single at 40.

248
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,069
Stop mother

249
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,434
When you become a father

250
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,397
you will understand how I feel.

251
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,994
Can I eat in peace?

252
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,549
Do you want more?  - No thank you.

253
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,915
Otar, let's go.

254
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,156
Now you can't wake him up.

255
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,230
Help me.

256
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,075
Otar, get up.

257
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,233
I finally fell asleep...

258
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,431
Did you take her to the train station?

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,719
Yes.  - And?

260
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,909
She wants to come back on Friday.

261
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,595
Does she bring her friend with her?  - Yes.

262
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,520
Great.  We will have fun.

263
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,195
I am not coming.

264
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,793
Are you crazy?

265
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,029
She's coming for you.

266
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,634
I think she fell in love with you.

267
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,236
That's why I won't come.

268
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,911
Do you think you're better than them?

269
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,953
Let's go to Kobuleti.

270
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,031
I'm fed up with Tbilisi.

271
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,399
What should we do in Kobuleti?

272
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,198
The weather is nice there.

273
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,990
We breathe fresh air.

274
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,151
We can sleep at my uncle's.

275
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,395
Dad, can I spend the weekend?

276
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,959
Borrow the car?

277
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,031
Where do you want to go?  - To Kobuleti.

278
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,955
Kobuleti in November?

279
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,348
Are you sane?

280
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,757
Few people, nice weather.

281
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,195
Maybe you can even swim.

282
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,634
You catch a cold

283
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,916
when you eat cold tangerines.

284
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,752
If you go swimming now

285
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,876
you'll get pneumonia.

286
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,995
Don't get involved

287
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,639
to the life of a 40 year old.

288
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,597
Don't you interfere in our conversation.

289
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,030
If you want him to marry

290
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,838
leave him in peace.

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,718
Last year they took my car

292
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,757
and broke it while drunk.

293
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,195
Uncle Otar, we're not drinking this time.

294
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,794
We breathe fresh air and get fit.

295
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,077
Then we will accompany you.

296
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,559
Why?  - Fresh air

297
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,948
will do us good too.

298
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,997
Also, we'll be careful

299
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,152
that they don't drink and screw up.

300
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,110
I can smell the sea.

301
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,510
How are you?  - Good, and you?

302
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,319
What a beauty

303
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,630
you became!

304
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,916
How are you doing?  - Good, and you?

305
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,430
Hello cousin.

306
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,148
Hello Avto.  - Avto, how are you?

307
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,076
How is the family?  - Good.

308
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,832
This is my friend Hatuna.

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,471
My cousin Sandro.  - My pleasure.

310
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,471
This is Sandro's friend Iva.

311
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,671
What a lovely girlfriend you have!

312
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Why did you hide them from us?

313
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,912
He's already flirting.

314
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,914
Hi.  - I'm pleased.

315
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,835
This is my wife.  - My pleasure.

316
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,911
See you in the evening

317
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,433
correct?  - Sure.

318
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,238
She comes over.

319
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,359
OK.  Bye.  - Until this evening.

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,675
We're going to the beach, are you coming with us?

321
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,671
I'm waiting for a girlfriend/

322
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,955
Maybe later.

323
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,832
Is she coming too?  - Yes.

324
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,349
What a beautiful place we have landed on!

325
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,916
Isn't that Anna?

326
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,388
That is her.  What is she doing here?

327
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,633
Anna!

328
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,875
Coach Iva, Mr. Sandro, how are you?

329
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,314
We are fine.

330
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,319
What are you doing here, little one?

331
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,674
My mother is here

332
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,029
I am on a business trip.

333
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,396
How are you doing?  - Good.

334
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,152
Is your mother there too?

335
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,548
Yes, I'll get her.

336
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,470
I am so happy to see you!

337
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,032
We are happy too.

338
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,192
Can we join?

339
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,953
Naturally.

340
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,997
How are you?  - Good.

341
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,957
I'm glad to see you here.

342
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,957
My best soccer mom leaves me

343
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,111
no alone, not even on vacation.

344
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,958
What are you doing here?

345
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,155
A friend has here

346
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,117
closed her beauty salon.

347
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,198
She gave me her accessories

348
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,839
and I'm here to get them.

349
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,276
Do you work in a beauty salon?

350
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,634
Yes, I am a hairdresser.

351
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,191
Anna, throw the ball.

352
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,633
Let's play?

353
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,514
Come on.

354
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,074
Anna, protect the ball!

355
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,358
Let's play!

356
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,671
My mom and I against both of you.

357
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,548
Anna, bring bigger stones.

358
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,794
This is our gate.  - This is ours.

359
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,632
Looks a bit small.

360
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,028
It's okay.

361
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,395
Ready?

362
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,073
Where are you?

363
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,195
Both mother and daughter.

364
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,353
And pass!

365
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,153
Goal!

366
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,839
Let him.

367
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,957
I have to stop smoking

368
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,196
He scored a goal.

369
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,552
It's good.

370
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,194
There are no compromises in sport.

371
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,351
I taught her that.

372
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,354
It's not badminton, it's football.

373
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,719
What did I teach you

374
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,552
Did I teach you that?

375
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,992
Come on!  Anna!

376
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,474
Pass, I'll let you shoot.

377
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,039
Goal!

378
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,029
I don't like it any more, I'm tired.

379
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,192
Congratulations

380
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,271
Can't you play better?

381
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,908
Let's go eat

382
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,559
Should we

383
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,472
take rain gear?  - Why not?

384
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,589
It doesn't matter where we sit.

385
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,557
Thank you.

386
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,832
Sweet! Bring us please

387
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,797
Chacha (Georgian vodka)!

388
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,997
Then Khachapuri and double lemonades.

389
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,598
Manana.  - Yes?

390
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,149
Did you collected the posters

391
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,759
after the game?

392
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,599
Yes, but it was difficult.  - Why?

393
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,676
Two guys didn't want to give their up

394
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,910
without getting my phone number.

395
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,228
And what have you done?

396
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,197
I gave them my number.

397
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,590
Did you know about my jealous

398
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,035
man, if they hadn't asked for it.

399
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,432
You're married?

400
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,233
Yes and no.

401
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,832
He is in prison.  We have

402
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,718
a phone date once a week.

403
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,514
Yes, father?  - Where are you?

404
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,635
Aren't you ashamed?

405
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,755
We met friends

406
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,069
and got stuck.

407
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,071
What friends?  - These girls here

408
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,639
been waiting for an hour.

409
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,360
We're almost there.  - Come immediately!

410
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,639
Just hear how they sing.

411
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,599
Anna, come here, you're getting wet.

412
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,435
When are you leaving?  - Tomorrow.

413
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,150
Too bad.

414
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,269
We could have a little

415
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,634
can go for a walk.

416
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,516
I have a shift tomorrow

417
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,240
so I have to leave early.

418
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,473
I wish I could stay.

419
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,312
We could have gone fishing.

420
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,948
I've never been fishing.

421
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,389
Long live this place!

422
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,753
Bravo!

423
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,632
Sweet!

424
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,398
Let's go?

425
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,918
Have you paid?

426
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,349
Goodbye.

427
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,630
A beautiful girl

428
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,149
waited with her friends

429
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,599
for five hours on you and that

430
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,593
might have changed your life.

431
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,671
But you'd rather roam around

432
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,114
and get drunk.

433
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,118
We're not drunk.

434
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,315
Yes, you are.

435
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,274
So tell me,

436
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,112
what do you want?

437
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,878
What is this behavior?

438
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,834
Look at me I'm talking to you.

439
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,593
What kind of people are you?

440
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,799
Where did you grow up

441
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,909
I would really like to know.

442
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,510
What is your goal in life?

443
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,789
Father, calm down.

444
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,190
What do you want to do with your life?

445
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,197
I would really like to know.

446
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,196
Otar, don't drink.

447
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,389
Did you say something

448
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,073
You mustn't drink.

449
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,038
Did you say something

450
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,908
There is tea.  - We are coming.

451
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,518
Tea will not help us.

452
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,677
Hello, how are you?

453
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,429
Good and you?  - Good.

454
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,319
How was the ride?  - Good and you?

455
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,633
I'm a bit tired.

456
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,233
Did you come back late

457
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,310
Not really.

458
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,031
Did you bring the posters?

459
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,708
Yes.  Where is Iva?

460
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,950
No idea.  I'm waiting for him.

461
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,348
Let's bring the posters

462
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,748
to my classroom.

463
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,513
Okay.

464
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,918
That's quite a few.

465
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,759
Too many?

466
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,591
Do you have class today  - Yes.

467
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,956
Am I disrupting?  - No.

468
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,632
School is great.

469
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,198
What school did you go to

470
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,349
To night school.

471
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,039
In my final year of school

472
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,553
I didn't go to classes.

473
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,189
Why?

474
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,836
I was pregnant with Anna.

475
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,315
I've been skipping school all the time.

476
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,591
I even had nightmares that the teacher

477
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,472
takes me to the blackboard as punishment.

478
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,839
What are you doing here, mother?

479
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,230
I brought the posters over.

480
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,472
Go home.  - Are you crazy?

481
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,790
Go home.  - Anna!

482
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,910
I said go home!

483
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,593
I hate these posters!

484
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,516
Why are you all silent?  Who is this?

485
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,352
King Erekle.

486
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,949
Which one?  - Erekle II.

487
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,508
Erekle II was one

488
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,114
of the most popular Georgian kings.

489
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,670
The people loved him.

490
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,992
They even gave him a nickname.

491
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,351
Do you remember?  - Little Kachi.

492
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,590
Right.  Why little?  - He was small.

493
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,076
Actually...

494
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,477
there is a folk song about this king.

495
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,630
I would like to recite it.

496
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,996
But I forgot it.

497
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,711
Can you refresh my memory?

498
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,795
Manana I would

499
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,359
like to hear it from you.

500
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,470
Our king is called Little Kachi.

501
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,995
He donned his armor

502
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,513
and tore them to pieces with his bare hands.

503
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,313
Thank you.

504
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,915
Can I ask you for help again?

505
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,870
Who is this?

506
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,759
This is my great-grandfather Nikipore.

507
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,916
Do you know why his ear is bandaged?

508
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,755
Once he ran through the forest,

509
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,150
and a beautiful woman called his name.

510
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,751
But he couldn't hear her.

511
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,716
In the evening they met at a party.

512
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,472
And she scolded him for

513
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,358
that he hadn't heard her.

514
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,557
Nikipore was a hothead and cut

515
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,358
cut off his ear with his dagger.

516
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,794
He said the ear was useless

517
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,837
if he can't hear it.

518
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,558
Would you care to

519
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,119
cut off your ear  for a woman?

520
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,074
That depends on the woman.

521
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,912
What if I called you?

522
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,430
Call me.  - Sandro!  - What?

523
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,797
I don't want you to hear me.

524
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,077
OK.  Call me again.

525
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,559
Sandro!

526
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,797
Shall we meet tomorrow?

527
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,678
I can't.

528
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,994
My husband is out of prison.

529
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,196
He was sentenced to four years

530
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,793
but he comes out early.

531
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,989
He is 36 and was

532
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,037
twice in prison.

533
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,710
The first time because he

534
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,235
stabbed a childhood friend with a fork.

535
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,314
He thought the guy

536
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,391
would have flirted with me.

537
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,838
How did you meet?

538
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,477
I went to school.  I was 14/

539
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,639
He saw me on the street

540
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,199
and I liked him.

541
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,311
I liked a lot of guys back then.

542
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,072
But after Tengo started

543
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,310
to accompany me home

544
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,595
and to give presents

545
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,751
all other admirers disappeared.

546
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,596
Then I got pregnant.

547
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,513
Anna was five when he was arrested.

548
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,430
He got four years, then he came out.

549
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,798
This year he was arrested again.

550
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,476
What happened this time?

551
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,511
He got into a fight.

552
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,512
Do you love him?

553
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,353
I used to love him.

554
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,431
Now I'm not sure anymore.

555
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,629
I'm sick of these problems.

556
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,910
He's trying to change

557
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,991
but he never succeeds.

558
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,276
He's probably unhappy too.

559
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,475
I don't know it.

560
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,317
I will talk to him.

561
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,755
I have never felt so good

562
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,797
like with you.

563
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,033
Never.

564
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,756
I am my whole

565
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,359
drive to the sea for life,

566
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,116
but I only remember the day

567
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,793
that I spent with you

568
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,716
I don't care who your husband

569
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,110
stabbed with a fork.

570
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,029
If you want it,

571
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,519
we will be together

572
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,197
I'll talk to him myself.

573
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,430
But not now.

574
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,551
I need time.

575
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,030
I'll drive you to prison.

576
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,672
Okay.

577
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,752
I have to go now.

578
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,839
Sandro.

579
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,593
Please leave as soon as I get off.

580
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,236
Would you like some Khachapuri?

581
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,276
No thank you.

582
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,277
OK, I'll have something.

583
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,950
How much does it cost?  - 80 Tetris.

584
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,593
Thank you.

585
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,629
Is Khachapuri good?

586
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,755
Not bad.

587
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,239
You see, give me some money.

588
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,675
How much does it cost?  - 80.

589
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,959
Take that.

590
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,877
Let's go to the station.

591
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,995
We'll see the bus

592
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,559
also from here.  Sit down.

593
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,159
The khachapuri is good.

594
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,558
Is this for me?

595
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,237
It is beautiful.

596
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,511
Do you like it?  - Yes.

597
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,034
I got the boys inside

598
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,519
asked to make it for you.

599
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,159
Thank you.

600
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,913
As my cellmate

601
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,354
saw it, he liked it so much

602
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,272
that he let it do it too and

603
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,476
asked me to give it to his mother.

604
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,549
I'll do everything right this time.

605
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,717
Do you believe me or not?

606
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,072
What is he doing?

607
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,357
Who cares what he does.

608
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,718
What is he looking for?

609
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,471
He locked himself out.

610
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,399
I'll go and help him.

611
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,515
Where are you going?

612
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,669
I'll help him.

613
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,671
Leave him, he'll be fine.

614
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,875
What's wrong with you?

615
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,189
I'm just helping him.

616
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,634
Leave him, he'll do it.

617
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,631
He will not.  - We'll miss the bus.

618
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,631
Calm down, don't stress around.

619
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,313
I'm not stressing, come back.

620
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,390
I said,

621
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,754
you should calm down.

622
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,277
To hell.

623
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,158
Is it closed, dude?

624
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,956
Yes, I left the key inside.

625
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,039
Wait a minute.

626
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,033
That too, please.

627
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,515
Hot Khachapuri.

628
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,557
Buy hot Khachapuri!

629
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,435
Khachapuri!

630
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,191
Damned.

631
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,198
Here please.

632
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,438
Thank you.  - No problem.

633
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,600
Are you driving to the town?  - Yes.

634
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,399
Can you take my wife

635
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,834
and me with you?

636
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,629
Okay?  - OK.

637
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,951
Manana, come on.

638
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,236
What's happening?  - Nothing.

639
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,516
Then kiss me.

640
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,315
What is wrong?

641
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,833
Did not you miss me?

642
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,634
It makes me feel uncomfortable.  - Why?

643
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,958
It's normal for someone

644
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,951
fresh out of prison.

645
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,758
He's busy driving.

646
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,830
Relax yourself.

647
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,269
Do you have a cigarette?

648
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,476
Thank you.  And a lighter?

649
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,718
Thank you.

650
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,270
Are you a part-time taxi driver?

651
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,351
Once in a while .

652
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,879
I need a car today.

653
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,192
I'll pay you and give you

654
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,998
extra money for gas.

655
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,111
Where are you going?

656
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,474
You just got out?

657
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,198
Can't you stay home today?

658
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,998
I have to go, it's urgent.

659
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,115
What's happening?

660
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,269
Why is that important?

661
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,668
It's business.

662
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,435
I want to know.  - Relax yourself.

663
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,310
So what are you saying?

664
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,593
It's good.

665
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,551
Wonderful.

666
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,272
I feel sick.

667
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,871
What's happening?  - I don't know,

668
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,632
I need fresh air .

669
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,234
Please stop!  - We're almost there.

670
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,628
I said I'm sick

671
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,199
and I need fresh air/

672
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,952
Hold on.  - What's wrong with you?

673
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,390
I feel sick.  I need air.

674
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,553
Thank you.

675
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,553
Damned.

676
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,114
Wait in the yard I'll be right back.

677
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,477
Throw the ball here.

678
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,073
Ready?

679
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,479
Good performance.

680
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,393
I have a great daughter!

681
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,037
You know how to catch it properly?

682
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,110
Don't let it

683
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,269
slide out your hands.

684
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,711
I'm still falling because of you.

685
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,869
Do not worry.

686
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,793
Natia!

687
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,509
How are you?  - Good.

688
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,955
Don't you feel cold?

689
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,109
Let's get in the car.

690
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,190
The sun is shining.

691
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,395
Come on!

692
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,836
Hi.  - Hi.

693
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,431
This is my friend Sandro.

694
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,359
My pleasure.

695
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,553
Sandro, can you please leave us

696
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,438
alone, we need to talk?

697
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,233
How are you doing?  - I'm good.

698
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,994
In which month are you?  - In the third.

699
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,957
Does the family know?

700
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,230
Yes.

701
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,073
Do they know about me?  - No.

702
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,191
Does my wife have any idea?

703
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,558
No.  - Really?  - No.

704
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,278
Natia, listen to me.

705
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,190
I hate talking about it

706
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,078
but you have to understand me.

707
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,279
I can't take full responsibility

708
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,158
for this baby.

709
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,713
I will of course help you.

710
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,433
I can't do much.

711
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,556
I just got out of jail.

712
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,352
I have no job and no prospects.

713
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,189
Everything is so messed up.

714
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,393
What can I say,

715
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,437
I hate abortions.

716
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,749
But do we have

717
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,194
another option?

718
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,959
I will not have an abortion.

719
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,269
I don't want that.

720
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,152
I understand that, but

721
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,470
is there an alternative?

722
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,274
I don't know but

723
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,078
I will not have an abortion.

724
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,393
I'll get the money.

725
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,471
I'll take you to the best doctor.

726
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,676
You're safe, don't worry.

727
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,149
I don't want your money  - Listen.

728
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,957
OK, you don't need money.

729
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,111
OK, you don't want to have an abortion.

730
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,554
I hate it too but

731
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,119
it's the only way.

732
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,833
What else do you suggest?

733
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,274
I will not do it.

734
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,634
Listen to me.

735
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,276
Let's go to this address.

736
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,833
My sympathies.

737
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,154
My sincere condolences.

738
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,038
Are you Zaza's mother?  - Yes.

739
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,394
I'm a friend of Zaza's.

740
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,278
I just got out of prison.

741
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,352
He had done this for you,

742
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,476
and asked me to bring it to you.

743
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,917
How kind of you. Many thanks.

744
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,992
Call Nuzgar.

745
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,113
How is my son? - Uncle Nuzgar.

746
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,509
Uncle Nuzgar, Natela is calling you.

747
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,716
Thanks, you

748
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,836
made so happy.

749
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,670
Look how caring my son is.

750
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,271
What happened?  - Zaza

751
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,152
sent me a ring from the prison.

752
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,992
This man is his friend.

753
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,719
Good day.

754
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,871
You were in jail with Zaza?  - Yes.

755
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,871
When did you come out?  - Today.

756
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,988
Congratulations  - Thank you.

757
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,435
Hi.

758
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,749
Have a moment

759
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,239
to talk about Zaza?

760
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,715
Sure.  - Please come.

761
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,717
What's the matter, Nuzgar?

762
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,439
He was in prison with Zaza

763
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,999
and came out today.

764
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,071
Come in.

765
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,718
I'll be right back.

766
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,428
Girls, leave us alone for a moment.

767
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,555
Because of that

768
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,995
called meat?  - That's soso.

769
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,228
How are you doing?

770
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,630
I just got out,

771
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,997
enjoying my freedom.

772
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,829
Nuzgar, look at that beautiful fish.

773
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,989
Something very special.

774
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,115
We will

775
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,474
serve funeral feast.

776
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,993
Look.

777
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,878
It's very fresh.

778
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,478
He gave me a special price.

779
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,358
How much?  - First he said 20 lari.

780
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,317
But we agreed on 18.

781
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,113
As for the catfish,

782
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,872
tomorrow we'll get

783
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,469
it fresh from the Alasani.

784
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,235
The fish is good.  - Good, but expensive.

785
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,389
We need

786
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,391
at least 20 kg, right?  - Yes.

787
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,632
You can't get it cheaper.

788
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,074
Let's talk about that later.

789
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,309
The fish seller's

790
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,754
waiting for my answer.

791
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,035
He'll sell it

792
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,589
maybe to someone else.

793
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,590
It still seems expensive.

794
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,274
The fish alone costs 400.

795
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,990
With the catfish...

796
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,993
... it makes it 800. - And off we go.

797
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,276
What should we do?

798
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,351
Maybe we should buy carp.

799
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,556
I'm sorry if I interfere

800
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,039
it's none of my business.

801
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,235
I think they are coming

802
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,674
also with a kind of fish.

803
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,319
Why?

804
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,315
Zaza needs money in prison.

805
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,117
Zaza needs money in prison?  For what?

806
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,271
He lost at cards.

807
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,509
He has to pay today.

808
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,277
Zaza played and lost?

809
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,908
He's a believer, it can't be

810
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,109
that he is playing.

811
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,991
He often visits the priest.

812
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,958
I know, but he played anyway.

813
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,916
I have to visit him in prison.

814
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,718
He hasn't played in ages.

815
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,949
How could that happen?

816
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,838
Go see him.

817
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,877
That's why I said yes.

818
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,271
I know you're short on cash.

819
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,795
Two types of fish are not necessary.

820
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,915
One is enough.

821
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,149
Besides, we can then

822
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,469
think about something else.

823
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,039
It's a delicate thing.

824
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,031
I saw the coffin at the entrance.

825
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,356
And?  - It's an expensive coffin.

826
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,669
Maybe you could

827
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,637
exchange for a cheaper one.

828
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,951
What the hell are you talking about?!

829
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,590
Let's think about something else.

830
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,318
Where's the funeral feast?

831
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,390
In a restaurant.

832
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,073
How much is this per person?

833
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,275
20 lari.  - 20 laris?

834
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,271
And we'll bring our wine.

835
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,959
20 lari with your own wine?

836
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,155
This is too much .

837
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,311
How many people are invited?

838
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,869
250th - 250?

839
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,756
Could a table be set up in the courtyard?

840
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,239
You have a yard right?

841
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,913
Yes.  - Over there.

842
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,672
Let's see.

843
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,632
Let's set up a tent in the yard

844
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,552
Who still uses tents today?

845
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,675
Why not?

846
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,638
The weather is nice. It has a lot of space.

847
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,438
We'll bring wooden chairs and benches.

848
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,715
Cover them with paper.

849
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,438
400 lari will be enough.

850
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,068
I'll get the benches.  - Well, then?

851
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,389
250 guests times 20 lari

852
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,118
per person, that's 5000.

853
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,679
In the yard it would cost only 500.

854
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,114
That would save you a lot.

855
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,309
You would help Zara

856
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,959
and there would be some money left over.

857
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,236
Don't tell us what to do.

858
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,628
We can manage on our own.

859
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,710
Listen brother

860
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,359
I won't tell you anything.

861
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,873
I'm here to help.

862
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,031
If you don't need me, I'll go.

863
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,792
OK, don't be mad.

864
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,996
He was just stating his opinion.

865
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,593
Yes, but it was rude.

866
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,671
Your son sent me here.

867
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,876
Our family is in a bind!

868
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,393
I see that, but do you think

869
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,754
my life is rosy?

870
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,114
I came out of jail.

871
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,077
Here are my discharge papers.

872
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,471
I have more important things to do

873
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,518
than discussing funeral feasts.

874
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,274
I'm only here to help Zaza.

875
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,037
It is your decision.

876
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,749
Let's help your son.

877
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,315
The priest is there to

878
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,038
hold the funeral ceremony.

879
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,758
I'll be there in a minute.

880
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,433
OK.  I'm leaving now.

881
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,273
Should I come back in an hour?

882
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,157
Okay.

883
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,515
I'm also trying to get some money for Zaza

884
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,318
to scrape together, but without guarantee.

885
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,799
See you later.

886
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,428
Oh my God.

887
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,473
Excuse me.

888
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,353
Sorry.

889
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,317
Let's stay a bit

890
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,838
Thank you.

891
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,559
How are you?

892
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,032
Why don't you say hello to Sandro?

893
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,599
Hi.

894
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,551
We have 30 minutes.

895
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,190
Please make us beautiful.

896
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,353
No thank you.  - Come on.

897
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,916
She's the best hairdresser in town.

898
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,798
Sit down.

899
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,992
With him, however, you

900
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,639
can't do much.

901
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,672
Would you like to wash your hair?

902
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,432
No.  - Of course he would.

903
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,236
You changed the shop here, didn't you?

904
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,799
No.

905
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,194
Were these photos

906
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,918
always here?  - Yes.

907
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,274
Are you sure?  - Yes.

908
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,511
Then that's fine.

909
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,153
Please don't smoke here. Go to the back.

910
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,279
Hello Natia.

911
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,632
How are you?

912
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,072
I'm glad to see you.

913
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,958
I have good news.

914
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,835
In an hour

915
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,877
I'll have 2000 lari for you.

916
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,518
I'm serious.

917
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,633
I'm not forcing you to have an abortion.

918
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,877
You must also understand my situation.

919
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,996
I just got out of prison.

920
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,477
But I already have 2000 lari for you.

921
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,278
We'll take care of the rest later.

922
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,714
Where is the problem?

923
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,871
Just calm down, OK?

924
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,833
Manana, where's the ashtray?

925
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,792
It was somewhere here.

926
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,359
Manana, where's the ashtray?

927
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,158
What are you doing there?

928
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,110
Here's your pay for this week.

929
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,235
Don't come back

930
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,753
Now get outta here.

931
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,672
What are you doing there?

932
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,476
Change outside.

933
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,551
What's happening?  Did something happen?

934
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,199
You caress my cleaning lady

935
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,634
in my presence!

936
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,835
Are you crazy?

937
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,793
A few hours outside.

938
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,075
What do you want?

939
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,633
Are you sane?

940
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,119
Nothing happened.

941
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,554
Look at me!

942
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,790
Nothing happened.  Got it?

943
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,636
Tengo, please go. - Why should I?

944
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,354
Out!  - I swear.  Listen to me.

945
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,112
Come here!  - Get out!

946
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,675
Do not touch me!

947
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,875
Calm down.  - Out!

948
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,553
Do not touch me!  - Calm down.

949
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,948
I said don't touch me.

950
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,553
I'll hit your head

951
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,630
with the iron.

952
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,392
Are you crazy?  Come on, go ahead.

953
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,356
Be quiet.  We are not alone.

954
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,110
How can you be jealous

955
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,759
on a refugee like Natia?

956
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,433
Are you really crazy or what?

957
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,828
Tengo, leave me alone.

958
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,228
Just relax.

959
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,549
Let go of my hand.

960
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,392
I'll relax when you go out.

961
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,470
Are you sure?  - Yes.

962
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,312
For sure?  - Yes.

963
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,515
Do not hit me!

964
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,999
Then get out!

965
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,229
You act like

966
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,674
a crazy.  - Out!

967
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,400
You are really stupid

968
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,633
Crazy.

969
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,435
Don't sit there.

970
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,352
I won't cut your hair.

971
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,591
Are you married Sandro

972
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,073
No.

973
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,269
If you ask me - never marry.

974
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,512
Why?

975
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,114
I landed in jail

976
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,269
because of my wife.

977
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,709
I don't know,

978
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,950
what to do with this Natia.

979
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,870
She is pregnant

980
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,519
and doesn't want to abort.

981
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,874
What should I do?

982
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,791
What about Zaza?

983
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,716
He played against Rezo and lost.

984
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,313
Do you remember Rezo?

985
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,232
Yes.  But Rezo has a phone,

986
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,118
why didn't he call himself?

987
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,190
He has none.

988
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,270
You found it

989
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,953
and gave him four more years.

990
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,633
For unauthorized phone possession,

991
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,755
and for gambling.

992
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,430
Why did they let you out?

993
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,039
You know I'm telling the truth/

994
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,110
I will find out.

995
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,792
Listen, Nodar.

996
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,639
The prison administration knew everything.

997
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,837
That Rezo had a cell phone and was playing.

998
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,319
That he forced people

999
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,799
to call their families on the phone

1000
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,870
to ask for money.

1001
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,519
The guards came and said

1002
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,590
that they who

1003
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,073
don't report gambling

1004
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,559
will get two more years.

1005
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,039
Everyone was afraid of Rezo

1006
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,349
and shut up

1007
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,272
but I was fed up.

1008
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,956
If you're fed up with Rezo,

1009
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,395
then why do you care about the money?

1010
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,634
Also, Zaza has stopped playing.

1011
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,233
He has become a believer.

1012
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,715
I really need money right now.

1013
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,680
And how you will make money?

1014
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,470
You know I'll pay it back

1015
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,790
as soon as I can.  You know me.

1016
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,189
I'll talk to you now

1017
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,032
and you'll disappear.

1018
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,593
Immediately.

1019
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,753
You bastard!  - Don't touch me!

1020
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,588
hands off me!

1021
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,353
Hey you let him go.

1022
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,629
He is the driver.

1023
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,797
Go to the car  - Let me pass.

1024
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,190
I said go to the car.

1025
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,592
Get off him.

1026
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,950
I'll kill that bastard!

1027
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,357
Get the other one over there!

1028
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,709
Take your hands away!  - Stand up.

1029
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,278
Take your hands away!

1030
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,153
Spread your legs!

1031
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,268
He's not to blame.

1032
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,668
Let him go!

1033
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,790
I am his father,

1034
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,518
let me explain

1035
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,671
Wait a second.  - He's his father.

1036
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,239
Let him explain.

1037
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,992
He was released today

1038
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,111
from prison.

1039
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,191
He came to the funeral and said

1040
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,117
my son has gambling debts.

1041
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,629
Hold him still, I can't hear anything.

1042
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,108
Check his papers.

1043
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,599
He said my son did

1044
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,193
lost 2000 lari in jail.

1045
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,237
He said I should give him the money.

1046
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,674
He came out today.

1047
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,876
Put him in the car, I'll find out.

1048
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,917
My father in law died.

1049
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,069
His grandfather.

1050
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,955
Please take off his handcuffs.

1051
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,912
Otherwise his mother will get

1052
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,274
a heart attack.

1053
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,032
Her father is dead, the elder son

1054
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,156
in prison and this one in handcuffs.

1055
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,548
Let me.

1056
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,757
Nodar, you are a hero.

1057
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,990
You saved us  - Thank you.

1058
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,469
We won't forget you.

1059
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,831
Nodar, thank you.  - No problem.

1060
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,673
We are forever in debt to you.

1061
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,233
What did you need the money for?

1062
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,277
For the family?

1063
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,073
Yes.

1064
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,429
I have money.

1065
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,272
I'll bring it to your family.

1066
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,708
Give it to the guy

1067
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,836
who came with me.

1068
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,035
Here, take this.

1069
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,273
Bye.

1070
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,593
Sandro.

1071
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,269
Bring this to Natia.

1072
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,271
She lives with the refugees.

1073
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,469
And take whatever I owe you.

1074
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,914
I don't want the money.

1075
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,512
Thank you.

1076
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,118
Hi guys.  - Hi.

1077
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,596
Do you know where Natia lives?

1078
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,752
Natia who?

1079
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,229
The thin one

1080
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,958
working in the beauty salon.

1081
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,678
What do you want from her?

1082
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,834
I should give her something.  - What?

1083
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,757
And who are you?  - Her brother.

1084
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,353
What should you give her?

1085
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,112
Some money.

1086
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,279
Come along.

1087
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,149
Gela, is everything OK?  - Yes everything is OK.

1088
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,671
This is my father.

1089
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,918
Dad, that's... - Sandro.

1090
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,671
Irodi, sit down.

1091
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,999
Is Natia here?  - Natia is

1092
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,991
shopping, she'll be back soon.

1093
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,311
Sit down, Sandro.

1094
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,391
Dad, stay and listen.

1095
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,357
What's the matter, son?

1096
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,152
Dad, this is the father of Natia's child.

1097
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,791
I hardly know her.

1098
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,109
I've seen her only twice,

1099
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,633
for ten minutes.

1100
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,518
Twice for ten minutes, huh?

1101
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,908
And you made it

1102
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,990
to impregnate her?

1103
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,229
Are you saying that

1104
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,833
my sister is a whore?

1105
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,236
We're her family, okay?

1106
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,753
Think before you speak.

1107
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,069
Calm down my son.

1108
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,116
You made her pregnant

1109
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,389
in ten minutes?

1110
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,675
Gee, what's up?

1111
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,829
Tell him you aren't

1112
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,989
pregnant by me.

1113
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,559
Gela, what do you want from him?

1114
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,948
He has responsibility.

1115
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,872
Take responsibility for your actions.

1116
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,359
What are you talking about?

1117
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,676
I don't even know him.

1118
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,159
What is he doing here?

1119
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,639
How should I know?

1120
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,915
You said that

1121
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,433
Tengo's boyfriend got you pregnant.

1122
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,556
That's what you said, right?  - Yes, but...

1123
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,757
Did you or didn't you?  - Yes.

1124
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,673
Well, there he is.

1125
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,115
If he is not,

1126
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,554
what is he doing here then?

1127
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:53,429
Since when do Tengo's friends visit you?

1128
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,795
And bring money?

1129
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,870
What is that?

1130
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,917
Is that all you offer?

1131
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,069
We are refugees

1132
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,309
not worth it to you?

1133
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,833
You sleep with our women

1134
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,919
I'll tear you to pieces!

1135
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:06,990
Come on, go!

1136
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,752
I said I'll tear you to pieces!

1137
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,319
Wait.  Wait a minute.

1138
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,313
Aunt please help me!

1139
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,799
What's going on here?

1140
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,757
Hold still for a moment.

1141
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,319
Wait, I'll tell you.

1142
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,790
Tell me everything.  - I'll tell you.

1143
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,959
She is pregnant by him.

1144
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,075
What did you say?

1145
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,355
He got her pregnant.

1146
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,879
And he doesn't want to marry her.

1147
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,314
Is she pregnant by him?

1148
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,993
Yes.

1149
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,795
Is what I'm hearing true?

1150
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,949
Aren't you ashamed?

1151
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,708
You refuse to be a father?

1152
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,156
Wait, don't interrupt me.

1153
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,519
Aren't you ashamed?

1154
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,031
Are you abandoning your child?

1155
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,798
How can you reject your child

1156
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,190
and this angel?

1157
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,430
Be quiet!

1158
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,558
How can you disown her?

1159
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,950
Answer me.

1160
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,236
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1161
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,799
An expectant father,

1162
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,592
An honorable man.

1163
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,837
A real Georgian.

1164
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,355
A real Georgian

1165
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,714
don't behave like that.

1166
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,236
You should conquer mountains

1167
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,436
for your child.

1168
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,437
It's right here under your nose

1169
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,079
and you don't want it?

1170
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,753
Look into my eyes!

1171
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,233
We trust you Sandro.

1172
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,389
Take care of yourselves.

1173
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,195
Have my blessings, children!

1174
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,913
God bless you.

1175
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,230
Don't turn off your phone, Natia.

1176
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,038
Gee, is everything OK?

1177
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,792
Yes, everything is okay.

1178
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,191
Why they hold their hands?

1179
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,635
That's how women walk around.

1180
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,472
Hi.  - Hi.

1181
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,592
How are you, Lali?  - Well, this is Maka.

1182
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,356
Iva.  - Give him your hand.

1183
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,478
My pleasure.

1184
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,916
Did you have a good trip?  - Yes.

1185
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,794
And how are you?  - Not bad.

1186
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,119
Shall we?  Our car is over there.

1187
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,838
Come on Maka, sit here.

1188
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,992
Sit down, Lali.

1189
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,112
It doesn't work.

1190
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,754
Is it locked?  - Probably.

1191
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,032
Sit down.

1192
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,916
Hello, I'm calling from the 408.

1193
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,116
The balcony door does not open.

1194
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,193
Why do I want to open them?

1195
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,078
I just want them opened.

1196
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,034
What do you mean by that,

1197
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,519
Did you finish?

1198
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,592
Listen, I'll pay for the room

1199
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,512
because of the balcony and the view.

1200
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,553
I don't care.

1201
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,711
I want the view.

1202
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,916
I need the view.

1203
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,315
Find Tamil

1204
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,311
and send someone.

1205
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,032
I need the view!

1206
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,592
Idiots!

1207
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,949
They say it's cold

1208
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,270
and they locked the balcony.

1209
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,119
It doesn't matter, I can see the view

1210
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,952
anyway.

1211
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,629
Just describe what you see.

1212
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,276
It's more interesting that way.

1213
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,833
What do I see from here?

1214
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,391
I see the old town of Tbilisi.

1215
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,278
The city of many balconies.

1216
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,832
The Kura.

1217
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,748
It also flows through Gori, right?  - Yes.

1218
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,233
Here it is different.

1219
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,992
It has more curves.

1220
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,915
Baratashvili liked to walk here.

1221
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,640
Alone?  - Alone.

1222
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,715
I can

1223
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,438
see Trinity Cathedral.

1224
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,398
You describe well.

1225
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,630
Come sit with me.

1226
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,632
I can't stay here.

1227
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,230
Can you walk with me?

1228
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,079
I'll take you to the train station

1229
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,918
If you want.  Sorry.

1230
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,993
Maka, I'm going.

1231
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,913
I'll wait for you at the train station.

1232
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,997
Iva, will you take her there?

1233
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,233
Of course.

1234
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,756
I'll take the bus number 7.

1235
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,389
If you can't make it, call me.

1236
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,795
Then we'll meet in Gori.

1237
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,113
Bye.

1238
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,348
Do you want to drink something?  - No.

1239
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,277
Some fruit?  We have apples.

1240
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,991
Yes, I would like one.

1241
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,035
Should I peel it?

1242
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,593
No, I'll do it myself.

1243
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,671
Really?  - Yes.

1244
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,068
I need the room.

1245
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,958
The Azerbaijanis are coming soon.

1246
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,997
They want to eat khinkali on the balcony.

1247
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,559
I'll give you another room.

1248
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,631
No thanks, we're leaving.  - OK.

1249
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,030
The balcony door is locked.

1250
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,358
I'll open it.

1251
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,390
They said,

1252
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,198
we have to leave the room.

1253
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,512
I heard it.

1254
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,750
Shall we go?  - Soon.

1255
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,838
Hi.

1256
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,592
Let's talk a little about the noises.

1257
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,273
Listen to the city and walk.

1258
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:30,992
Shall we dance?

1259
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,151
But we don't have music.

1260
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,309
Never mind.

1261
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,910
Are you coming with me?

1262
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,395
To where?  - To Kobuleti.

1263
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,672
My mother asked me

1264
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,750
to pick her up.

1265
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,438
What do you need me for?

1266
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,670
To keep you awake while driving?

1267
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,273
Yes.

1268
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,951
I had a terrible dream.

1269
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,873
I had a crew of

1270
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,792
trained blind soccer players.

1271
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,592
I was strict.

1272
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,756
What's wrong with you?

1273
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,631
Are you still depressed?

1274
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,513
Seems so.

1275
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,198
Did something happen?

1276
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,799
Nothing important.  - Tell me.

1277
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,597
A friend of mine was arrested.

1278
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,670
His girlfriend is pregnant.

1279
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,512
Which friend?

1280
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,232
I am your friend.

1281
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,791
I still have one.

1282
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,751
We studied together.

1283
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,711
He'll probably get five years.

1284
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,790
I feel sorry for his girlfriend.

1285
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,315
She is pregnant and
doesn't know where to go.

1286
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,997
I took her with me.

1287
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,030
Is there a woman in
your apartment right now?

1288
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,593
Yes.

1289
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,113
And she's staying for five years now

1290
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,872
with you until the guy comes out?

1291
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,270
Why don't you marry her?

1292
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,436
She seems ready.

1293
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,230
I have to tell you something.

1294
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,355
What's happening?

1295
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,710
We have a guest

1296
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,671
A woman - a friend of mine.

1297
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,116
She's staying with us for a while.

1298
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,998
Who is she?

1299
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,355
Just a friend.

1300
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,715
You would too

1301
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,359
can thread differently.

1302
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,469
What do you mean by that?

1303
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,039
She's just a friend.

1304
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,551
A friend lives with you

1305
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,029
for a while.

1306
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,428
Of such a friendship

1307
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,794
I have never heard.

1308
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,077
Do you know her?

1309
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,593
No.

1310
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,556
Who are her parents?

1311
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,913
She is not from Tbilisi.

1312
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,115
I'm fed up with this

1313
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,429
from your country girls.

1314
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,556
By the way, a wise man should

1315
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,314
marry a provincial girl.

1316
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,391
Roger that?

1317
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,715
Why marry?

1318
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,472
I will not marry her.

1319
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,596
Then keep it to yourself.

1320
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,710
How old is she?

1321
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,352
Around 25.

1322
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,318
How are you?  Are you bored?  - No.

1323
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,272
Mother, this is Natia.

1324
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,192
I'm glad, I'm Lia.

1325
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,231
You can call me Aunt Lia.

1326
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,592
And this is Otar.  - Hello, my pleasure.

1327
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,554
Hi.  - Hi.  - This is Iva.

1328
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,678
Let's have dinner..

1329
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,035
I brought all kinds of goodies.

1330
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,553
But you have to go shopping.

1331
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,675
I'll help you.

1332
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,432
No thanks, go watch the TV.

1333
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,754
Help is not necessary.

1334
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,353
Lia takes care of everything.

1335
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,714
Mom, what should I buy?

1336
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,755
Bread, tea, peas.

1337
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,277
Sandro, bring me glasses for this.

1338
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,869
Where did you get that?

1339
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,110
From your uncle.

1340
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,509
Do you want to watch football

1341
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,999
or should I switch?

1342
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,434
Let it be.

1343
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,040
Do you like football?  - Yes.

1344
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,872
It's a Bundesliga game

1345
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,917
but I don't recognize the teams.

1346
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,638
Hamburg and Dortmund.

1347
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,313
Wow.

1348
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,034
Do you like German football?

1349
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,918
No, Italian.

1350
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,950
Girls like Italian football.

1351
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,917
handsome guys in shorts,

1352
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,752
running after a ball.

1353
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,952
It's not about that.

1354
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,029
I just like the style.

1355
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,552
I like the focus

1356
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,755
on the defense.

1357
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,229
And what do you like about it?

1358
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,836
They always play defense.

1359
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,470
It's always dangerous
in front of their goal.

1360
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,629
It is excited

1361
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,119
when you see them play.

1362
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,712
I like that tension.

1363
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,190
But it's not just the excitement.

1364
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,551
You score goals too, don't you?

1365
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,789
Oh yes they do.

1366
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,590
Pass it!  Make a pass!
 What is he doing there?

1367
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,835
That's why I don't like

1368
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,831
German football.

1369
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,031
What could he have done?  - He should have

1370
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,270
play the ball to the right.

1371
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,035
Right or left?  - Right.

1372
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,758
You know something about football.

1373
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,711
Come here for a moment.

1374
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,751
Just look at him.

1375
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,516
This boy has problems.

1376
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,913
Then talk to him.

1377
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,957
What should I tell him?

1378
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,035
Does he really

1379
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,111
betrayed a grieving family?

1380
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,951
He didn't cheat on her.

1381
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,835
The son of the family

1382
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,479
had gambling debts.

1383
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,429
Without your husband the guy

1384
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,477
would be in a bind now.

1385
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,355
He would have problems in prison now.

1386
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,356
He behaved very bravely.

1387
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,592
He was attacked by 20 guys

1388
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,398
but he was fearless and clear-headed.

1389
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,318
You are a good man.

1390
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,950
And you will find a good wife.

1391
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,797
Bring her here too.

1392
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,357
For a hairstyle.

1393
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,873
I cut both men

1394
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,519
as well as women's hair.

1395
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,239
