NO MATTER WHAT THE ADDICTION,

IT HARMS YOUR BODY, MAKES YOU SICK,

Attention, dear passengers.

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,500
Train Gareeb Yatra from Darbhanga
to Punjab is two hours...

00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,370
I beg your pardon,

6
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,950
it's 22 and a half hours late.

7
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,950

Sarbati...

30
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,580
Sarbati...

31
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,450
There...

32
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,950
Over there

33
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,370
under the cot.

34
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,040
Oh.

35
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,080
Under it...

36
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,790
Mummy!

37
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,250
They're leaving.

38
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,750
I'll be right there.

39
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,450
Wow, bro.

40
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,410
Is your mother able to recognise
one from the other?

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,080
Of course.

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
She's educated

43
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,580
not from Bihar.

44
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,870
Silly girl.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,370
What are you doing?

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,176
Don't you know it has
to be delivered tomorrow?

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,410
You guys are the limit!

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,370
It's heavy, Sarbati.

49
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,750
- I'll manage.
- Let me help you.

50
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,120
Let me take this.

51
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,750
Not my fault.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
No problem, aunty.

53
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,040
- Pick them up, 30-second rule.
- No.

54
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm an honest woman.

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,886
Forget the ones that
have fallen on the ground.

56
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,450
I don't want to serve these
and burn in hell.

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,620
Have you resigned?

58
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,000
Mummy, madam is back.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
You guys, leave.

60
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,620
Who are you?

61
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,016
Why do you want to
go inside the house?

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,910
Mummy, please...

63
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,120
Don't call me Mummy.

64
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,370
I'm not your mother anymore.

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,926
Mummy, I want to go to the bathroom.

66
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,040
Stop this drama.

67
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,870
Jerry...

68
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,830
Jerry...

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,040
Mummy...

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,580
Have you given up that dirty job?

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,266
Let me go, Mummy.
Or else, I'll do it here!

72
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,450
I know

73
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,910
you're capable of that.

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,580
You can do anything you want.

75
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,000
Your parents
don't mean anything to you.

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
Why are you bringing Papa into this?

77
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,950
He is dead, Mummy.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,160
You talk too much.

79
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,500
No, he isn't.
He's standing right here in a sari.

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,830
If I don't guide her, who will?

81
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,040
Sarbati...

82
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,830
She has to work

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,330
to earn money.

84
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,660
Don't speak to me about money.

85
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,000
I could've cooked
non-vegetarian food if I wanted.

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I'd earn ₹4 more
for chicken dumplings.

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
But I didn't.

88
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,870
I only make vegetable dumplings.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm not doing this for you!

90
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,450
I'm doing it for myself,
to earn money,

91
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,100
so that I can get out
of this rat hole.

92
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,450
Rathole, huh? Rat...

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Rat...

94
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,080
Come out, I want to talk to you.

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,870
Sarbati, patience.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,620
Get some water
for your mother, Cherry.

97
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,290
She works in a massage parlour!

98
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,540
And you want me to be patient?

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,080
Has the ceiling
of your house fallen?

100
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,370
- No.
- What are you doing here then?

101
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Go home.

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,040
She has become so selfish, Mummy.

103
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,290
I can't get married because of her.

104
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,910
Your massaging is ruining my future.

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,750
Mummy.

106
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,500
Will you stop this drama?

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,870
I'm aware that I'm a girl, Mummy.

108
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
When to smile or to cry

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,870
when to talk or to keep quiet...

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know.

111
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,370
I'll manage.

112
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,660
Dumplings are originally
from Darjeeling.

113
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,950
They're being made by Biharis

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,700
and being gobbled up by Punjabis.

115
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,080
Just like my fate is gobbling me up!

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,330
Papa died in a stampede
two years ago.

117
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,370
That's when our lives ended as well.

118
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,760
Ever since then, we've been trying
to get our lives together again.

119
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,120
Every day there is a new struggle.

120
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,950
Instead of waiting for others
to say it, I will say it.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,330
Uncle, at least add some milk!

122
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,830
Sure.

123
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,540
So, Fatty, what's up?

124
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,700
The usual.

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,120
Rinku, I heard

126
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,580
you got rejected by
Khatri's daughter too.

127
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,080
Never mind her.

128
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,580
Rinku has high standards.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,040
Have you seen her teeth?

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,480
Her face looks like
a kitchen grinder.

131
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,870
Her teeth grind together
every time she smiles.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,410
How can she reject Rinku?

133
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,870
I've lost interest
in studies, Mummy.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,580
Please get me married soon.

135
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
This is the house.

136
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,660
Is there a wedding?

137
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,140
I've lost interest
in studies, Mummy.

138
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,950
Please get me married soon.

139
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,580
Where are the guests?

140
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,120
I'm going in.

141
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,620
Every time I close my eyes,
I see you.

142
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,200
I can't live without you.

143
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,290
Aunty, I want to
marry your daughter.

144
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm ready to marry her.

145
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,830
Look, I'm ready.

146
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,250
- Marry her off to me.
- Hey!

147
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Who the hell are you?

148
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,830
How did you get in?

149
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,040
My love wasn't receiving my calls.

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I got restless.

151
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,120
Get her to talk to me, please.

152
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,080
Go!

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
You!

154
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,620
I know how to deal with
chickens like you!

155
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,750
Understand? Get lost.

156
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm not leaving.

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,040
I will marry Cherry.
Marry me, Cherry.

158
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,040
- Get lost!
- Please.

159
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,160
- I'm not leaving without Cherry.
- Hey...

160
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
- Oh, Cherry?
- Yes.

161
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,540
- Cherry?
- Yes.

162
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
Mine... Jerry.

163
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,040
Oh, my brother-in-law!

164
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,040
You're so cool, man.

165
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,620
What "brother-in-law"?

166
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,950
Are you crazy?

167
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,000
You think there's no "man"
in the family to protect them?

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,040
Aunty, let me marry Jerry.

169
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,386
- What's going on?
- I'll take care of everything.

170
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,290
I'll be the man of the house.

171
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,500
What's happening?

172
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
Who are you guys?

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Uncle... I am Rinku.

174
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,596
I don't care
whether you're Rinku or Pinku.

175
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,910
Get out or I'll call the police.

176
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,950
Police?

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,040
What will the police do?

178
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Beat me up?

179
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm in love, uncle.

180
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,306
And lovers are not afraid
of anything!

181
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,290
Yeah, right.

182
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,290
Get out or I'll break your legs.

183
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,290
Hello, who are you to intervene?

184
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,860
Why are you hitting the poor guy?

185
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,660
You're a neighbour, act like one.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,910
Who do you think you are?

187
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,370
That doesn't matter.
Who the hell are you?

188
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,040
I love Jerry.

189
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,620
I love Cherry.

190
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,290
And I love Sarbati!

191
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,290

You'll find it spicy.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,870
I told you the ones near
our place are better.

221
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,370
Fine, you can go there.

222
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,080
Don't get offended.

223
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,750
He adds chemicals.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,977
It tastes synthetic.

225
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,830
Since you're in the food business,

226
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,540
you should take feedback positively.

227
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,450
What happened?

228
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,580
Do you want water?

229
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,200
Did you make it too spicy?

230
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,160
No, she's having the sweet ones.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
Please give some water.

232
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,750
Do you have a chair?

233
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,160
Look, she has lung carcinoma

234
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,250
with mediastinal lymphadenitis

235
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,080
and multiple lung opacities.

236
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,410
In simpler words

237
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,830
she has lung cancer, stage two.

238
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,370
But there's nothing to worry about.

239
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,410
Radiation therapy and chemotherapy
are available.

240
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,700
Certain cases require both.

241
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,450
- And...
- The cost?

242
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you have health insurance?

243
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,250
No.

244
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,910
Each sitting will cost
up to ₹150,000.

245
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,200
In total, it'll cost

246
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,790
around ₹2 million.

247
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,290
The initial stages of treatment
will show

248
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,200
how your mother is responding.

249
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,040
As the sessions progress,

250
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,080
her health should start improving.

251
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,950
I know you need it.

252
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,750
Please keep it.

253
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,790
We need ₹2 million.

254
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,200
Do you have that much?

255
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,700
No need to act so generous.

256
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,290
If I had ₹2 million,

257
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,970
would I be running
this massage parlour?

258
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,450
Please, ma'am. I'll pay you back.

259
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,700
How will you pay me back?

260
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,200
That too such a large amount?

261
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,500
Mummy...

262
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,870
- Let's go.
- Come on...

263
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,410
Such an expensive hospital.
I don't want to go.

264
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,830
- Where are you going?
- Mummy.

265
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,000
One minute.

266
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,660
I can only help if aunty has HIV.

267
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,750
See this one.

268
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,040
An important announcement
by the police.

269
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,200
There's a 20% discount.

270
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,790
Help the police stop terrorism.

271
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,660
If you see any suspicious bag...

272
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,250
He's hiding here in the market.

273
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,290
Or a suspicious person,
inform the police.

274
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,160
Sir, I'll call you back.

275
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,870
You there!

276
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,790
Catch him!

277
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,580
Don't let him escape.

278
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,540
Stop!

279
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,080
Catch him.

280
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,620
Stop!

281
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,910
Stop!

282
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,830
Nab him.

283
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,410
Trying to escape?

284
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Sorry, sir,
I didn't realise while opening...

285
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,830
No problem, miss.

286
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,000
He's a criminal;
He was running away.

287
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,330
You helped us catch him.

288
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,040
I'll take you to the police station
and beat you up.

289
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,226
Where have you hidden the drugs?

290
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,170
These guys hide the drugs
in all sorts of places.

291
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,920
I can't discuss this
in front of the ladies.

292
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,700
- Take him away.
- Come on.

293
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,370
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

294
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,120
Uncle...

295
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,750
What about our reward?

296
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,790
He's a petty thief.

297
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,226
If there were rewards
for catching these guys,

298
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,580
I'd be a senior officer by now.

299
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,290
Uncle, but you said he's a criminal.

300
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,580
Cherry!

301
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,700
Move away!

302
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,807
Hey, you!

303
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:27,910
Why were you arguing?

304
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,950
He's a cop.

305
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,120
So what?

306
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,750
Hurry up. Go!

307
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,870
Go, go...

308
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,910
But...

309
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,790
And you are?

310
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,250
I'm Jigar, he's Daddu,

311
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,806
and the one with
the broken neck is Timmy sir.

312
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,830
Careful.

313
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,250
And this is

314
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,700
my gun.

315
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,500
Jigar.

316
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,200
- Put it away.
- Sir...

317
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,580
We don't have anything, sir.

318
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,370
This is not even a gold chain.

319
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,120
We don't want your stuff.

320
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,120
We want our stuff.

321
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,500
Get to the point, bro.

322
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,700
Look, miss, remember the guy
you banged into?

323
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,830
The police caught him.

324
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,750
Amazingly, he hid our stuff
in a toilet before that.

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,830
You will go and get it for us.

326
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,870
Simple.

327
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,330
- No thanks, excuse us.
- Cherry...

328
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,660
Do I look like I'm begging?

329
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,846
You won't be excused.

330
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,870
Jigar

331
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,160
respect the ladies.

332
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,120
Sorry.

333
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,370
The police are inside;
Our boys can't go in.

334
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,040
They won't suspect you.

335
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,950
Please go and get it.

336
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,410
- Your sister stays with us till then.
- No...

337
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,700
- Jigar...
- Yes?

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,120
Buy her an ice cream.

339
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,370
- Please, sir...
- Bro...

340
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,790
- Go...
- It was by mistake.

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,040
- Come.
- It was a mistake.

342
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,370
It was an accident!

343
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,580
Please...

344
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,290
Do you want one or two?

345
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,410
- Hey!
- Sir...

346
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,020
- Get our stuff.
- Give us ice cream.

347
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,160
It was an accident, sir.

348
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,370
Go.

349
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,410
Sir...

350
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,450
- Search them.
- Sir.

351
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,250
Please let me go in, sir.

352
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,476
It will only take me two minutes.

353
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,700
We're searching the place;
You can't go in.

354
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,660
- I'll be in trouble, sir.
- No.

355
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,830
- Pavan.
- Yes, sir?

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What's the problem?

357
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,250
She's saying
she left some paper inside.

358
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll be in big trouble, sir.

359
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Sir, please.

360
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,700
Let her go in.

361
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,450
- Go.
- You can go in.

362
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,080
Listen carefully, miss.

363
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,370
Our guy has hidden the stuff
inside one of the toilets.

364
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,540
You have to find it and get it.

365
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Simple.

366
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,750
Gents toilet.

367
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,000
Fine, give me two days.

368
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll call you in two minutes.
I'll call you.

369
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,870
Tell me...

370
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,500
Timmy, she's here.

371
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,580
Sis...

372
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,830
What do you think?

373
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,290
Can she save you?

374
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Got it?

375
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,870
Take it out. I won't look.

376
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Take it out.

377
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Inside the bag?

378
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,910
Sir, it's in the tiffin box.

379
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Tiffin?

380
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Tiffin.

381
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,040
Those cops can smell our shit
from miles away.

382
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,750
Sorry, please excuse my language.

383
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,080
Sir, the tiffin box...

384
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,750
Want it back?

385
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,790
Daddu

386
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,450
do you have a plastic bag?

387
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,790
- Jigar...
- Yes?

388
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,120
Get a plastic bag.

389
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,370
Give me a bag.

390
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,700
Take it.

391
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,950
I'll close it.

392
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,000
Let me close it, sir.

393
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,620
Listen

394
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,250
don't tell anyone about all this.

395
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,340
You better not blabber
to your boyfriend...

396
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,750
I don't have a boyfriend, sir.

397
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,910
You don't?

398
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
No, sir.

399
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,000
May I go?

400
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,870
No, Timmy. No.

401
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,830
Don't.

402
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,910
Listen...

403
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,290
Yes, sir?

404
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,620
Leave that strand of hair as it is.

405
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,290
You look pretty.

406
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,910
- Jigar.
- Yes, Daddu?

407
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,540
- Go...
- Sis.

408
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,410
Bye-bye.

409
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,830
Have you lost your mind?

410
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,950
What if he'd shot us?

411
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,660
It's wrong, Cherry.

412
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,430
And what about the rubbish we have
to deal with? Is that all right?

413
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,540
It's not wrong!

414
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,920
I simply picked up
what had fallen on the ground.

415
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,620
There's a lot of money in it.

416
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Exactly.

417
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,500
Jerry, wake up.

418
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Go and freshen up.

419
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,040
Comb your hair nicely.

420
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,870
- Come in, son.
- Rajinder, come in.

421
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,540
- Come in.
- Hello.

422
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,200
- Hello, ma'am.
- Come in.

423
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,080
I want two photos, son.

424
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,790
One, a family photo

425
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,790
- of the three of us.
- Sure, ma'am.

426
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,080
- The other one is of just me in it.
- Okay.

427
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,950
Put my photo

428
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,540
in a nice, cheap frame

429
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,000
and write the date...

430
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,330
No, don't write the date.

431
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,000
Mr. Anil will tell you
which date to write.

432
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,097
In the shop...

433
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:51,450
Why don't you die today itself?

434
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,160
You brought him, didn't you?

435
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,580
I didn't know
she called him for this.

436
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,610
What are you trying to prove here?

437
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Would you have done this drama
if I were a boy?

438
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,200
Jerry

439
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,450
let's get the photo taken today.

440
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,160
My face is still okay now.

441
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,750
I'll look haggard later.

442
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,790
Aunty...

443
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,250
Aunty

444
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,500
we can use Photoshop to...

445
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,160
Oh, you'll use Photoshop, will you?

446
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,677
You'll use Photoshop?

447
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,540
- Get out of here!
- Don't...

448
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,620
- What are you doing?
- You'll use Photoshop.

449
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,580
You're not dead yet. You're alive.

450
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,870
So am I.

451
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And as long as I'm alive,
I won't let you die.

452
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,540
Right...

453
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,950
Left...

454
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Daddu, I heard something snap.

455
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,200
It's nothing...

456
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,120
- I heard...
- Do the exercises.

457
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,330
Left...

458
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,426
There it is!

459
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,450
I heard it again.

460
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Okay, enough.

461
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,080
Take this off.

462
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,290
Bro

463
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,870
that girl is here.

464
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
Rita?

465
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,830
The new one.

466
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,080
The pretty and innocent girl
who'd got our stuff out.

467
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,450
The one you fancied.

468
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,790
You!

469
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,250
You talk too much.

470
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,950
What does she want?

471
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,636
She got our stuff out for us.
She deserves a commission.

472
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,370
How did she know
how much it was worth?

473
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I told her myself.

474
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,330
She asked me and I told her.

475
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,870
- I'm all for honesty.
- Of course.

476
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
How did she get our address?

477
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,290
Timmy, is he mad?

478
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Don't you have any brains?

479
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,726
No wonder you're not the boss!

480
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,450
Do you have any common sense?

481
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,910
Remember, I'd lost my wallet?

482
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,040
She found it.

483
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,750
My visiting card was in it.

484
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,870
Personal... it had this address.

485
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,370
Oh, my God...

486
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,330
I checked her background, bro.
It's clear.

487
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,556
Her father is dead,
sister is a student,

488
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,410
mother has cancer.
Poor thing sells ducklings.

489
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,370
- Sells what?
- Ducklings, those small ones.

490
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,950
Idiot, they're called dumplings,
not ducklings.

491
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,250
Get her in.

492
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,330
Sister

493
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
come.

494
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,120
Close the window, Jigar.

495
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,700
Sit.

496
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Sir

497
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,000
we want to work.

498
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,000
"We"?

499
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,080
How many of you are here?

500
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,200
No...

501
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,540
Bro, she's from Bihar.

502
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,500
That's how they speak.
She actually means "I".

503
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,660
My mother is ill.
I need money for her treatment.

504
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,040
I'll do whatever you ask me to

505
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
pick up and drop packages

506
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,040
deliver...

507
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
Timmy

508
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,500
she thinks we're into illegal stuff.

509
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,977
You're mistaken.

510
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:45,080
That packet contained flour
to cook samosas.

511
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,450
We sell them in our shop.

512
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,290
You should try them;
They're delicious.

513
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,040
Have one before you leave.

514
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,426
It's too dangerous for a girl.

515
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,450
But I had safely got
the packet out that day.

516
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,160
No one suspected anything.

517
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,500
The cops can smell your shit
from miles away, can't they?

518
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,370
It's not as easy as it was that day.

519
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,540
Sir, please.

520
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,870
Try and understand

521
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,250
this is a risky job.

522
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,160
So is crossing the road.

523
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,500
Love is also very risky.

524
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,500
It can break your neck.

525
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm putting my trust in you.

526
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,910
Don't betray me.

527
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,830
Your mother won't die of cancer...

528
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,790
I'll shoot her.

529
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660
Go.

530
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,040
Come tomorrow.

531
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,620
Thank you, sir.

532
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,500
Thank you, sir.

533
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,750
Listen

534
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,290
be back.

535
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,370
Get a hold of yourself, bro.

536
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,750
Daler sir,
I've checked her background.

537
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,016
Why are you taking my clothes off?

538
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,017
Are you mad?

539
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,290
Her background is clear.

540
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,330
Her father is dead,
her sister is a student.

541
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,000
What have I done?

542
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,410
Are you crazy?

543
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,080
Her mother is suffering from cancer.

544
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,580
Poor thing sells dumplings.

545
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,830
What?

546
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Ducklings?

547
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,950
- Put me down.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,160
So?

549
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,870
She is an innocent girl.

550
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,660
Lal won't have a clue.

551
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,580
We've hit the jackpot.

552
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,910
Don't worry.

553
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,080
Remember, Timmy

554
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,870
she's a girl, all right?

555
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,750
Use your brains. Okay?

556
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,040
- Catch him.
- Be careful, Joginder.

557
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Daddu!

558
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,580
Hey, listen to me...

559
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,250
We will hear you tomorrow.

560
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,000
You fatso...

561
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,040
Tell me
where you've hidden the drugs.

562
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,500
Or else, I'll thrash both of you.

563
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,870
- The drugs are nowhere in the market.
- What?

564
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm telling you...

565
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,620
- You're known as Danger Lal, sir.
- Really?

566
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,370
I swear.

567
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,580
Boys get high on kerosene nowadays.

568
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,870
- Do they?
- Yes, sir.

569
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,040
Wow!

570
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,750
- They must really fear me.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,910
Idiot!

572
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,830
These two won't submit easily.

573
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,750
Then let's help them
with that, shall we?

574
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,620
Cocaine, heroin, smack, stuff

575
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,040
they're known by different names.

576
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,120
They're worth more than your life.

577
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,700
It's a simple job.

578
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,950
I'm the supplier,
and Malik is the distributor.

579
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,080
You have to pick up the stuff
from me and deliver it to Malik.

580
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,450
Where I get the stuff from
and where Malik sends it

581
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,000
none of your business.

582
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Do the job well to stay alive.

583
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,910
Killing someone is
not a big deal for us.

584
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,500
With Baba Mardanda's blessings

585
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,540
get started.

586
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,580
Sir

587
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,226
there's a girl here to see you.

588
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,227
Send her in.

589
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:00,410
Wait, what?

590
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,040
Timmy sir has sent me to...

591
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,790
Fish is the queen of water.

592
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,450
And water is her life.

593
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,450
If you touch her
She'll get frightened.

594
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,120
If you take her out of the water...

595
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,750
She'll die.

596
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,160
Roast her in an oven.

597
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,290
And it'll be delicious.

598
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,700
Squeeze some lemon juice.

599
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,040
And she'll make a tasty dish.

600
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,410
Sir! My phone...

601
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,290
Fish is the queen of water.

602
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,330
Even the walls have ears.

603
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,910
Police.

604
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,540
This is how we can be safe.

605
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,330
Right.

606
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,000
Has Timmy cast a spell on you?

607
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,870
- What?
- Are you aware of what you're doing?

608
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,910
It's only flour.

609
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Awesome.

610
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,000
A round of applause, please.

611
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,750
He's clapping for you.

612
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,000
Who are you clapping for?

613
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,250
Shut your mouth, you fool.

614
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,540

678
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,910

679
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,290
What did I do?

680
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,870
Not you... God

681
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,790
by making me so handsome.

682
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,120
All the girls
are losing their mind over me.

683
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,470
Jasmine came home
the day before yesterday.

684
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,410
She thinks she's an angel!

685
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,766
I don't think she's any good though.

686
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,750
She came and fell
at my parents' feet,

687
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,500
saying, "Uncle... aunty..."

688
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,330
"Rinku and I belong together."

689
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,950
Then she pounced on me saying,

690
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,200
"Rinku, promise me you're mine!"

691
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,290
I looked at her,

692
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
and said, "Jasmine..."

693
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,790
"Come on, stand up..."

694
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,000
"What does 'no' mean?"

695
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,330
"'No' means no. Okay?

696
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,580
"Now, go.

697
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,790
"And listen,
take your cell phone with you."

698
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,620
"Don't use it
as an excuse to meet me, okay?"

699
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,040
"Go."

700
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,790
Jerry

701
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,750
her face fell, you know?

702
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,330
No...

703
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,830
Jerry, don't...

704
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,000
I am yours... only yours.

705
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,330
I rejected her, didn't I?

706
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,790
It's okay... You can go.

707
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,450
She's crying...

708
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,620
Oh, God!

709
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,000
Such innocence!

710
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,660
Hello...

711
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,000
Inspector Lal,

712
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,500
the city is flooded with drugs
and you're sleeping?

713
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,000
- Who is it?
- Never mind.

714
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,660
There's a girl who's making you

715
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,620
- look like a fool every day.
- A girl?

716
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:20,910
How?

717
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,160
Punjab Roadways.

718
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,080
Bus number PB-05-7474.

719
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,160
What does she look like?
Where does she board the bus?

720
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,830
Listen...
do you have her photograph?

721
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,700
You go back to sleep.

722
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,410
People say, "Inspector Lal
is a dangerous guy."

723
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,830
Nonsense!

724
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,200
Listen...

725
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,830
Hey!

726
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,120
Pavan!

727
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,500
Slowly...

728
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,870
Come on...

729
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,200
- Stop the car.
- Slowly.

730
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,580
Stop.

731
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,750
Stop.

732
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,580
You guys, go check.

733
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,180
Search everyone.
No one should be left out.

734
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,370
Sir.

735
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,910
Everyone

736
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,120
each passenger will be searched.

737
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,200
Be quiet and sit patiently.

738
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,330
- Madam, you search all the women.
- Okay.

739
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,290
- You search the ladies.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,790
Check properly.

741
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,700
Take your bags out, everyone.

742
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,830
Madam, show me your bag.

743
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,700
Open your bag.

744
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,000
Check properly.

745
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,910
Whose bag is this?

746
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,160
Open the bags and search them.

747
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,620
Hello, madam!

748
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,040
I'm talking to you.

749
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:34,950
Hello...

750
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,830
Sir is asking you something.

751
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,370
Hello, madam, look here.

752
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,430
Are you trying to avoid
getting searched?

753
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,450
I know Inspector Lal.

754
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,120
Kusum, move aside.

755
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,450
I'll check.

756
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,910
Give me your bag.

757
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,750
- I...
- Please give me your bag, madam.

758
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,000
Take your bag.

759
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,790
What's inside?

760
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,120
Comic books...

761
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,790
What's this?

762
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,950
It's just food!

763
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,540
Come on, leave.

764
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,750
You got away because
I was there, Timmy.

765
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,430
Otherwise, Lal would
have hit the jackpot.

766
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,040
Okay, bye.

767
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,120
Stop crying, Jerry.

768
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,290
Okay, sir...

769
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,250
Nothing happened.

770
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,660
Jassi is one of our guys.

771
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,000
It could have gone wrong, sir.

772
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,750
Timmy has a lot of enemies,

773
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,190
one of them must be behind this.

774
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,660
No, sir.

775
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,950
Even I have a lot of enemies.

776
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,500
Everyone is jealous of me

777
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,250
because of the way I work.

778
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,500
Or else how would the police
get to know of my trip?

779
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,620
I'm really scared, sir.

780
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,120
Daddu...

781
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,580
Use your brains, Timmy!

782
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,580
Jigar.

783
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,000
- Whose phone is this?
- It's mine, sir.

784
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,160
Mine.

785
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,080
Come here.

786
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,290
- Where's the call history?
- No, sir...

787
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,250
No... it wasn't me.

788
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,000
No...

789
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,620
No, sir.

790
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,790
I like her.

791
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Madam...

792
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,450
It wasn't me. Madam.

793
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,950
I swear on my mother.

794
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,290
It wasn't me...

795
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,580
Sir...

796
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,580
Sir, it wasn't me.

797
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,040
Did someone use your phone?

798
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,040
Yes.

799
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,080
Joginder had used it in the morning.

800
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,330
He must have called the cops.

801
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,830
One of you has informed the cops.

802
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,910
You tell me
why he would've done it.

803
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,450
And you tell me why he would have.

804
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,250
Sir, I swear on Baba Mardanda...

805
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,080
I didn't make any calls.

806
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,790
I'm sure this rascal did.

807
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,450
Shut up. Why will I inform the cops?

808
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,926
Because you need money to
take your girlfriend out on dates.

809
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,426
He has been sitting idle
ever since she has come.

810
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,450
He's lying, sir.

811
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,450
- My girlfriend is rich; She pays.
- No, sir.

812
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:58,250
Madam is from Bihar
and he has a problem with that.

813
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,450
Let me explain, sir.

814
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,226
Jerry is a girl, and he's insecure
because she's earning more than him.

815
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,870
That's why this dog
has informed the cops.

816
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You know what, sir?
He wanted to be the boss.

817
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,370
When he saw you giving
all your attention to her,

818
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,410
he tried to get her
out of his way by...

819
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,410
Sir...

820
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,330
He is such a big liar!

821
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,160
Ditto, sir.

822
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,750
Don't copy my line.

823
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,790
- Go on...
- What?

824
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,000
Nothing like that...

825
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:33,000
Hail Baba Mardanda!

826
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,580
Hail him.

827
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,870
- Take him away.
- Clean the mess.

828
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:42,950
Thank you, sir.

829
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,160
Thank you, madam.

830
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,660
Sir, I'm not convinced.

831
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,540
What if he's behind this

832
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,950
and you have shot the wrong guy?

833
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,950
No, Jerry

834
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,580
my instincts are never wrong.

835
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,080
Oh, please. You thought
Rita would marry you,

836
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,790
but your instincts were wrong.

837
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,200
That's right, sir.
Instincts can be wrong.

838
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,700
We can't take a risk.

839
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,750
There's no hurry.
You can take a break.

840
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,580
Don't let her talk you
into this, sir.

841
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,000
She's talking rubbish.
Don't believe her. She's a girl!

842
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,290
My uncle lives in Thailand.

843
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,750
I'd rather die than betray you.

844
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,750
No way.
Don't listen to her.

845
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,410
Shoot him, only then I'll leave.

846
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:31,790
No, sir...

847
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:32,910
Don't listen to her.

848
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,040
No, sir...

849
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,450
I know you didn't do this.

850
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,660
Exactly.

851
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,040
But it's impossible
to find someone like her.

852
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,120
She's great at her job.

853
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,000
I can lose 10 guys like you,

854
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,290
but I can't lose her.

855
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,370
No, sir...

856
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,950
Don't believe her.

857
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,450
Don't listen to her.

858
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,790
Sir, she'll get me killed!

859
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,040
You'll need me!

860
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,160
Please don't, sir!

861
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,250
Please, sir...

862
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,500
Sir!

863
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,200
Should I spare him?

864
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,750
No...

865
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,160
Sir, I'll die!

866
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,040
Don't listen to her!

867
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,950
No, sir...

868
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,660
Sir, don't listen to her.

869
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,290
She'll get me killed!

870
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,040
Trying to avoid getting searched?
Open your bag, madam.

871
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,040
You'll need me.

872
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,410
Don't, sir!

873
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,290
I'll die, sir.

874
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,200
Please, sir.

875
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,450
Madam...

876
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,400
What do you want to discuss, Jerry?

877
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:18,950
Sir, I...

878
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,750
Timmy.

879
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,120
Mr. Timmy...

880
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,830
I can't work for you anymore.

881
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,500
Please settle my dues.

882
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,120
What's wrong?

883
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,250
I just killed two guys for you.

884
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,160
That's what scares me, sir.

885
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,000
Your men think...

886
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,120
I'm stealing their jobs.

887
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,500
What should I do, Jerry?

888
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,000
Should I kill them all for you?

889
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,040
His Poor Majesty enters.

890
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,700
Look at him...

891
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,120
Fool!

892
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:09,660
Stop, Timmy.

893
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,200
Why are you hitting them?

894
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,830
No, let's go inside.

895
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,000
Be careful with your neck.

896
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,370
Sit down.

897
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,700
- Sit.
- Let go!

898
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,950
Take care.

899
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,700
There are only two ways
you can quit this job.

900
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,660
Either get shot
by the cops or by us.

901
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,080
What should I do with you?

902
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,120
You're a good girl.

903
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,660
I'll let you go.

904
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,500
You're a good man.

905
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,580
Come and take

906
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,620
your money tomorrow.

907
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,250
Listen

908
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,450
come tomorrow.

909
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:36,700
What's wrong?

910
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,950
Why are you sulking?

911
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,040
I'm not.

912
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,700
Mummy!

913
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,080
Are you crazy?

914
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,790
I have ice cream up my nose.

915
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,000
Oh, come on!

916
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,540
Cherry, don't...

917
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:53,950
Cherry, please!

918
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,370
You're so serious these days.

919
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,290
Hello, Mr. Timmy.

920
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,790
How are you, Jerry?

921
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,250
Take the bag.

922
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,750
Thank you, Mr. Timmy.

923
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,540
You think I'm a nice guy, Jerry?

924
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,620
Yes.

925
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,677
Are you sure?

926
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:39,910
You've helped me so much, Mr. Timmy.

927
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,370
You're leaving;
You'll lead a happy life.

928
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,000
What about me?

929
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,500
Sir?

930
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,500
Timmy.

931
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,080
You're very clever, Jerry.

932
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,000
You know exactly
when to call me sir,

933
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,250
when to call me Timmy

934
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,620
or Mr. Timmy.

935
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,370
- Mr. Timmy...
- Quiet!

936
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,510
You work in a massage parlour,
don't you?

937
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,330
Yes, but...

938
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,540
Give me a massage now.

939
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,250
Mummy!

940
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,676
Mummy, Cherry, we have to leave...

941
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,120
Dumplings with spicy chutney.

942
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,410
Press harder.

943
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,370
Hurry up, aunty.

944
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,450
Or else, you'll miss the train.

945
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,910
So, where are you going?

946
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,200
Patna or Darbhanga?

947
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,750
Daddu...

948
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,830
I'll shoot her.

949
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,410
Should I?

950
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,540
Should I shoot her or not?

951
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,370
- Quick, tell me.
- Wait.

952
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:19,870
Wait... Move away.

953
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,160
Wait...

954
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,330
- Come on.
- Go.

955
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,910
Daddu... Mr. Daddu.

956
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,830
My name is Mohinder Singh Chandal.

957
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,620
Mohinder Singh Chandal.

958
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:36,620
Mr. Chandaal...

959
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,910
Not Chandaal! Chandal.

960
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,700
Mr. Chandaal...

961
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,700
Not Chandaal! Chandal.

962
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,500
She did all this for me.

963
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,330
For me...

964
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:52,660
Keep quiet, aunty.

965
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,250
Sit there.

966
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,290
Aunty, sit. Sit down.

967
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:59,040
Poor Timmy...

968
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,000
He will be bedridden for life.

969
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,570
It's not what you think, sir.

970
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,700
I didn't do anything.

971
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:06,267
I really didn't.

972
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,750
I just pushed him.

973
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,200
His pants were down.
He tripped and fell.

974
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,637
Why are you laughing?

975
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:14,950
I knew it right when I saw you

976
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,000
you're a shrewd and...

977
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,250
Yes, Uncle?

978
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,160
Yes, she is here.

979
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,830
- Yes.
- Move, Daddu.

980
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,620
Uncle wants to talk to you.

981
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Hello...

982
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:32,910
Hello, sir.

983
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Hello, my child?

984
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,040
How are you?

985
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,870
I didn't do anything, sir.

986
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,750
No, no.

987
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,200
Don't be scared.

988
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,870
It'll be an easy death.

989
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Painless.

990
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,910
No, sir. Please don't do this.

991
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,120
I give you my word.

992
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
So, tell me...
should we start with your mother

993
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,540
or your sister?

994
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:52,870
No, sir

995
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,660
listen to me.

996
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,080
I'll do whatever you want.

997
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,370
Good boy.

998
01:00:58,750 --> 01:00:59,790
That's like it.

999
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,910
The powder will reach
your house tomorrow.

1000
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,410
You have to deliver it
to Malik's farm.

1001
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,580
Then you're free.

1002
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,290
I'll do it, sir. I'll do it.

1003
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,040
Okay. 100 kilos.

1004
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,250
How can I deliver 100 kilos, sir?

1005
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:17,750
No problem.

1006
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,080
Put me on speaker.

1007
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,160
Okay, sir.

1008
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,040
You're on speaker, sir.

1009
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,410
Daddu...

1010
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,660
Yes, sir?

1011
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,000
Hail Baba Mardanda!

1012
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,830
Hail Baba Mardanda!

1013
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,000
No!

1014
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,250
No, don't!

1015
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,290
I'll do it.

1016
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,620
Good.

1017
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,620
Okay. See you, buh-bye.

1018
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:00,790
What have you done!

1019
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,410
Sarbati, what are you doing?

1020
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,910
She's your daughter!

1021
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,660
But, Sarbati...

1022
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,250
I was trying to help.

1023
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:38,040
♪ Why have you left me alone ♪

1024
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,200

♪ And ask for everything

1030
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,370
You're in this mess because of me.

1031
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,200
I'll get you out of it.

1032
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,750
Did we get overconfident?

1033
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,580
Why are you getting involved
in this mess, Anil uncle?

1034
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,290
You are like my family.

1035
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:12,790
But what we're doing...

1036
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,000
You're not family,

1037
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,330
so don't try to be.
Know your place.

1038
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:18,000
- Please leave.
- I won't.

1039
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,620
What do you mean you won't leave?

1040
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,000
- I'm not going.
- Leave!

1041
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,540
I'm not going anywhere.

1042
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,660
This is my house too...

1043
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,750
- My family...
- No.

1044
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,160
Quiet!

1045
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,750
Listen to me carefully.

1046
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,000
See

1047
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,160
there's no difference between
food delivery and drug delivery.

1048
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,200
The only difference is fear.

1049
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,700
You won't be scared
when you're delivering dumplings.

1050
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,500
But when you're delivering drugs,
you'll be scared.

1051
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,750
It'll show on your face,

1052
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,160
and the cops will notice it.

1053
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,500
So you need to control
your expressions.

1054
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,580
Pretend to be totally innocent.

1055
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,700
If anyone asks questions,

1056
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,870
start crying.

1057
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,910
Get it?

1058
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,160
Yes.

1059
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:01,200
I understand.

1060
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,016
- Okay.
- Jerry, listen...

1061
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,540
Don't get smart with me.

1062
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,950
I am not Timmy.

1063
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,000
Start with your drama.

1064
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,680
The vehicle will come
outside your house.

1065
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,200
My driver will get off,
and you have to drive the vehicle.

1066
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,080
Why do I have to drive?

1067
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,200
Take a look at my men.

1068
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,620
Now look at your people.

1069
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,910
Now think like a cop.

1070
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,540
I get it.

1071
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,410
Can you drive, Anil uncle?

1072
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,540
I used to be a truck driver.

1073
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,950
I even have a licence.

1074
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,790
Are you all right, Sarbati?

1075
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,030
- Do you want water?
- Mummy.

1076
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,830
What's wrong, Mummy?

1077
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,660
Mummy, what happened?

1078
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,450
I'm just acting.

1079
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,950
Me too.

1080
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,250
Is this okay, Jerry?

1081
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,160
Mummy!

1082
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,580
Help!

1083
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,000
Please help.

1084
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,910
Mummy is sick.

1085
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,200
She is shivering.
We need to take her to the hospital.

1086
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,750
Please...

1087
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,450
Help.

1088
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,410
Jigar, let me check.

1089
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,580
Are you crazy?

1090
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:57,080
Come out...

1091
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,540
Come out.

1092
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,016
- What is it?
- It was an accident.

1093
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:01,790
Come out.

1094
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,596
That girl was shouting for help,
so that's why we are here.

1095
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,620
Sorry.

1096
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,080
This girl is mine.

1097
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,370
The neighbourhood is mine.

1098
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,620
And you'll help her?

1099
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,180
- How come?
- Why? What's the problem?

1100
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:11,870
- Problem?
- Yeah.

1101
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Get lost.

1102
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,950
Rinku, no...

1103
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,330
Try your luck elsewhere.

1104
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,976
- Why are you doing this, Rinku?
- Come out of the car.

1105
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
What if I don't?

1106
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,250
Watch it!

1107
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,790
- Hey!
- Shut the...

1108
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:25,540
This is Rinku's neighbourhood!

1109
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,160
Let go of my hand.

1110
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,040
I'll teach him a lesson.

1111
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,290
What are you doing?

1112
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,200
Don't...

1113
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,370
Rinku!

1114
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,330
Rinku...

1115
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,040
Mummy is sick.

1116
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,516
We have to take her to the hospital.

1117
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,830
That's why I'm here, baby.

1118
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,120
Oh... we can go in that car.

1119
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,870
Why will you go in that car?

1120
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,330
You can take this one.

1121
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:57,040
Have you seen these guys, baby?

1122
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,970
One look at them
and the patient will die!

1123
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,160
I'll get you...

1124
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,370
Rinku

1125
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,040
try to understand.

1126
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,410
Yes.

1127
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,620
Is he mad?

1128
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,160
You're so shy!

1129
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,040
Always worried about
what people might say.

1130
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,910
No one will find out about us.

1131
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,250
Promise.

1132
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,620
I'm having an affair with her.

1133
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,040
I'll go and get your mother.

1134
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,370
Mummy!

1135
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,370
Go.

1136
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,040
Don't bother, Rinku.

1137
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,660
She's my mother-in-law.

1138
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,250
Silly girls.

1139
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,540
No, Rinku...

1140
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,410
- Mummy...
- Wait, you don't understand...

1141
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:46,790
Mummy

1142
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,450
your son is here.

1143
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,540
Sarbati...

1144
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,080
Oh, no...

1145
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,450
Take the settee along...

1146
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,270
- Settee.
- Settee! -Who's Settee?

1147
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,950
The bed. Take the bed along.

1148
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,660
You'll get a bed in the hospital.

1149
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,000
This used to be Papa's bed.

1150
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:06,590
She doesn't want to die
on someone else's bed.

1151
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,200
My dead husband's bed!

1152
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,620
Her husband died on this bed too.

1153
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,830
Hurry up...

1154
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,410
Don't worry, Mummy.

1155
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,120
You'll be fine.

1156
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,200
What's wrong?

1157
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,330
This is true love.

1158
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,910
I love you, Mummy.

1159
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,120
Jerry

1160
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,790
promise me.

1161
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,500
You'll never sleep
on anyone else's bed.

1162
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:37,450
- Fine, I won't.
- Come on, help us.

1163
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,080
I'll get you a fantastic bed.

1164
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:43,890
By the way,
what is she suffering from?

1165
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:45,670
- Nothing infectious, right?
- No, it isn't.

1166
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:46,830
Lift the bed. Mummy...

1167
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,790
Guys, come in and help.

1168
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,790
What happened?
What are you doing?

1169
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:53,070
Why are you touching my feet?

1170
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,700
You lift that corner.

1171
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,200
Careful.

1172
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,580
No!

1173
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,620
What are you doing?

1174
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,160
Not on your shoulders.

1175
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:01,450
She's still alive!

1176
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,540
Let's go.

1177
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,000
Careful.

1178
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,620
What's it called again? Shetty?

1179
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,016
- Don't worry.
- This Shetty is really heavy.

1180
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,950
What are you doing?

1181
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:10,950
Mind the spider webs!

1182
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,910
They're on my face.

1183
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:15,880
My vessels!

1184
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:17,950
You idiots! What's all this crap?

1185
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,540
Go back.

1186
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:24,660
Turn, turn, round, round...

1187
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:26,580
You are in Rinku's hand, Mummy.

1188
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,040
Just relax.

1189
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,176
- Let's go, Jerry.
- Good job. That should do it.

1190
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,000
- Sit inside.
- No, Rinku.

1191
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,250
- Anil uncle.
- Yes.

1192
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,540
- He will drive.
- Yes.

1193
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,700
Why? I'll drive.

1194
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:58,870
No.

1195
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,660
What?

1196
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,160
Try and understand, Rinku.

1197
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,540
Oh, understand...

1198
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:11,790
Oh, she wants me to sit with her,

1199
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,040
hold her hand,

1200
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,790
keep her head on my shoulder
and cry.

1201
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,160
- Go ahead, uncle.
- Yes, all right.

1202
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,450
- Let's go.
- Careful with the gears.

1203
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,950
♪ I don't want to study ♪

1204
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,200

1206
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,290

Let's go.

1208
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,160
Hurry up.

1209
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,040
♪ Get me married... ♪

1210
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,540
Let's go, uncle.

1211
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,950
Hide.

1212
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,580
Cherry!

1213
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,500
Save Mummy! Get Cherry!

1214
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,370
Mummy.

1215
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,370
Yes.

1216
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,080
Take a deep breath, Mummy.

1217
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,370
Don't worry.

1218
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,000
- Mummy.
- Aunty...

1219
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:55,370
I, Rinku Khanna, promise you that

1220
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,620
I will take care
of both your daughters.

1221
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,660
All right?

1222
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,040
You can peacefully

1223
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:08,250
peacefully

1224
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,330
not worry.

1225
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,370
Drive faster!

1226
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,700
Yes, bro.

1227
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,040
- Jerry...
- Yes?

1228
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,370
Jerry, police.

1229
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,700
Mummy, start coughing.

1230
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,330
Don't be afraid.

1231
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,410
- I'll talk to the police.
- Rinku, no!

1232
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,080
Okay.

1233
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,500
Stop.

1234
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,830
Stop the car.

1235
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:45,410
What's wrong, sir?

1236
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,910
Idiot!

1237
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,200
We have a patient.

1238
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,700
A woman, sir...

1239
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,160
What's going on?

1240
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,920
- What's wrong with her?
- She's very sick, sir.

1241
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,766
It's an emergency.
We're taking her to the hospital.

1242
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,310
- Give me the file.
- Show me her file.

1243
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:00,700
Take a look, sir.

1244
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,370
The doctor asked us to take her...

1245
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,700
Jerry baby...

1246
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:07,870
Sit inside, Rinku.

1247
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,870
I'll handle this.

1248
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,040
Go and sit.

1249
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,660
What are you doing, Rinku?

1250
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:14,950
This poor old mother.

1251
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,200
Your mother.

1252
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,750
My mother too.

1253
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,620
Is going for treatment.

1254
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,370
And telling everyone her story.

1255
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,370
Leaving her children behind.

1256
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,370
She's about to die.

1257
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,330
Die... die...

1258
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,790
This is so unfortunate.

1259
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,290
Midway we got stopped by wolves.

1260
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,950
Who are tearing off her flesh.

1261
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,500
They're showing off their power.

1262
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,330
Power... power...

1263
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,120
You stand at every crossing.

1264
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,040
- Asking for bribes.
- Shut up.

1265
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,790
- You say you're there to protect us.
- Shut up!

1266
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:46,750
Is this the way to behave with us?

1267
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,500
Sir, sir, please...

1268
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,370
Mummy.

1269
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,250
Please, sir.

1270
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:56,080
- I have to go.
- Don't!

1271
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,000
Please, listen...

1272
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,870
Is this the way to behave with us?

1273
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,250
Sir...

1274
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,450
Please, sir.

1275
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,790
Lie down, Mummy.

1276
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,250
Please let us go.

1277
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:06,500
My mother is very sick.

1278
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,450
He is the one who's sick.

1279
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,660
Get him admitted as well.

1280
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:10,700
I will, sir.

1281
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:11,950
When I add music to this,

1282
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,176
- the entire country will get emotional.
- Who has stopped you?

1283
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,660
Then you'll learn a lesson.

1284
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,200
I'll take care of it, sir.

1285
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:18,700
I'll take care...

1286
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,830
Fraud Michael Jackson.

1287
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,700
- Take him away.
- Yes, I will.

1288
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,500
Did you bribe to become a cop?

1289
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,080
I'm gonna beat up that fool!

1290
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,040
Check them.

1291
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,660
Go.

1292
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,580
Hey!

1293
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,040
So, where are you going?

1294
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,540
We're following that vehicle.

1295
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:46,290
- Idiots! You think I'm a fool? Get out!
- No, sir.

1296
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,040
Aunty,

1297
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,870
give him something
to strengthen his heart.

1298
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:54,080
He is easily swayed by emotions.

1299
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,700
Yes, sir?

1300
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,870
Daddu, as soon as
you receive the goods...

1301
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,290
We'll kill the family.

1302
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:04,080
I know that, sir.

1303
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,450
I know that very well.

1304
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,290
I see Daddu has become intelligent.

1305
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,950
Come on, sir

1306
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,290
please call me Mohinder Singh.

1307
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:13,660
Sure, Mohinder.

1308
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:15,330
Thank you so much, sir.

1309
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:16,950
Thank you.

1310
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,040
Did you check out Rinku's swag?

1311
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,830
If we weren't taking Mummy
to the hospital now,

1312
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,500
I would've told her right now.

1313
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:28,870
Rinku...

1314
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:30,267
Uncle,

1315
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:32,136
you can run over anyone
who tries to stop the car.

1316
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,800
- Rinku will take care of things.
- Rinku.

1317
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,250
You know why I've never
played Cops and Robbers?

1318
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,620
The game is not about
cops and robbers.

1319
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,790
The game is about
robbers and robbers.

1320
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:43,950
Rinku!

1321
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,200
What's wrong, baby?

1322
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,620
Mummy...

1323
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,330
Get off the bed.

1324
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,660
Why?

1325
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,476
Why are you making her
get off the bed?

1326
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,910
Do you want to lie down?

1327
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:58,790
This isn't right, Jerry.

1328
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:00,200
- Not now.
- Listen.

1329
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,850
- Please lie down, aunty.
- Keep quiet.

1330
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,790
What's this?

1331
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
What is this?

1332
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,330
Drugs.

1333
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,000
It's what the cops are after.

1334
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:21,870
Drugs.

1335
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,080
Yeah, right... drugs...

1336
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,250
Such a huge quantity of drugs,
in my van.

1337
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,580
Means?

1338
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,790
It means
you should stop talking shit!

1339
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,580
This is cocaine. Cocaine!

1340
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,910
Haven't you seen it in movies?

1341
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,580
This is worth ₹100 million.

1342
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,016
It has come all the way
from Columbia to Africa,

1343
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,080
Africa to Afghanistan,

1344
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,120
Afghanistan to Mumbai,
Mumbai to Chandigarh.

1345
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,040
And now it's inside your stupid van.

1346
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,556
We have to deliver it
to the fish farm.

1347
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:59,040
Till then just keep your trap shut!

1348
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,250
If we get caught,

1349
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:02,540
we'll be in jail for 10 years.

1350
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:03,950
Means?

1351
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,410
What's wrong with this man?

1352
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,290
Jerry, police. Again.

1353
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,160
Mummy...

1354
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,596
- The police are here.
- Mummy, lie down.

1355
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,830
The police are here, Jerry.

1356
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:14,000
Shut up!

1357
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,120
Or I'll give you a tight slap.

1358
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:25,790
Search the vehicle.

1359
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,160
Stop.

1360
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,227
We need to hurry, sir.

1361
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:32,830
Let me check the papers.

1362
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,950
She's very sick.

1363
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,540
They had stopped us
at the previous check post too.

1364
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,120
He's my brother.

1365
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,580
Fine, you can leave.

1366
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,000
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

1367
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,200
That girl works so smoothly.

1368
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,830
She's dodging past all check posts.

1369
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:56,200
Lal won't be able to catch her
in a million years.

1370
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,040
Damn, Rinku

1371
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,700
you'll get thrashed today.

1372
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,910
How did you forget?

1373
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:18,080
Aunty, I make videos
of my mother's cooking.

1374
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:19,910
She posts cooking videos.

1375
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,790
I had to make a video of her
making yam curry today.

1376
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,540
And I'm here.

1377
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,950
Please stop the car, uncle.

1378
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,160
I need to go home.

1379
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:30,500
Do you see that van?

1380
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,200
That one?

1381
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,160
They'll shoot you
if you get off now.

1382
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:44,370
Just sit quietly.

1383
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,160

1414
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,330
EVEN THE WALLS HAVE EARS
DON'T SAY A WORD

1415
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,200
I'm not helping with the settee.

1416
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,350
EVEN THE WALLS HAVE EARS
DON'T SAY A WORD

1417
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,500
THIS IS FOR OUR SAFETY

1418
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,370
Okay, sir.

1419
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,910
I'll take your leave...

1420
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:51,950
Oh.

1421
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,290
Sir...

1422
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,870
Me?

1423
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,410
Me?

1424
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:54,450
The groom...

1425
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,620
Yes, you.

1426
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:14,000
Rinku...

1427
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,160
What's he saying?

1428
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:17,910
Rinku...

1429
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,250
Fish is the queen of water.

1430
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,660
And water is her life.

1431
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:33,000
If you touch her
She'll get frightened.

1432
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,410
Take her out of the water.

1433
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:35,910
Or else, we'll all die!

1434
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,000
We'll all die!

1435
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:42,910
RINKU'S MOM

1436
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:53,620
Aunty, we've become
real-life drug dealers.

1437
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:56,000
We've delivered
such a huge quantity of drugs.

1438
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:02,580
Uncle, please turn the van around.
Let's go home.

1439
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:06,700
The job might be done, but

1440
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,370
the plan has just begun.

1441
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:18,500
Means?

1442
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,000
You were to deliver cocaine.

1443
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,120
Cocaine!

1444
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,700
Only 10 kilos of it is cocaine.

1445
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,870
The rest is salt!

1446
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:30,160
- What?
- If I don't get my stuff...

1447
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:33,080
I'll rip your beard to shreds!

1448
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:45,120
Hey, Daddu, where's my stuff?

1449
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,450
Call me Mohinder, sir.

1450
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,620
Mohinder my foot!

1451
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,910
Where are those rats?

1452
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,950
You better make sure
I get my stuff, or I'll...

1453
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,040
Where's Jerry, sir?

1454
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,516
How the hell will I know
where she is!

1455
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,700
She isn't receiving my calls!

1456
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:56,870
My stuff...

1457
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,200
One hour.

1458
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,610
You have one hour to deliver it.

1459
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:02,160
Otherwise I'll kill you first
and then her.

1460
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,750
Get it? Daddu!

1461
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,160
You frog! You idiot!

1462
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,910
Do you want to die, Jerry?
Where's the stuff?

1463
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,500
With me.

1464
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:16,910
All 90 kilos of it.

1465
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,410
Jerry, I'll shoot your mother...

1466
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,750
I'll disconnect the call.
Keep quiet and listen to me.

1467
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:23,700
Don't take me for a fool.

1468
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,830
I know I'm safe
as long as I have the stuff.

1469
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:29,870
Listen carefully.

1470
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,950
I'll hand over
the entire thing to you.

1471
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,160
You can be the boss.

1472
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,870
Tell Daler that Jerry
has fled with the goods.

1473
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:40,000
No way, I don't want to die.

1474
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:43,450
Fine, you can keep living
as a puppet in their hands.

1475
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:46,500
Think about it...

1476
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:47,830
Mr. Mohinder.

1477
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,660
You don't need to
worry anymore, Jerry.

1478
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:12,790
You and your family
will be free after this.

1479
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:16,200
Mohinder Singh Chandal assures you...

1480
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:17,790
Sir.

1481
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,620
Yes, sir?

1482
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,450
I'm searching for her,
haven't found her yet.

1483
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,750
I think she has fled with the goods.

1484
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,250
Yes.

1485
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,580
Excuse me?

1486
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:33,750
Okay, sir.

1487
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,950
You're on speaker now.

1488
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,410
Jerry, my child...

1489
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,870
Don't believe her, sir.

1490
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,290
She'll get us all in trouble.

1491
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:50,500
Sir, please...

1492
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,950
Give me one more chance.

1493
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,950
Daddu, I had told you

1494
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,370
she's from Bihar.

1495
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,370
Jigar, give the gun to Jerry.

1496
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,250
But, Uncle...

1497
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:03,790
Give it.

1498
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:06,040
Jerry, don't...

1499
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,540
Shoot Daddu.

1500
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:11,500
Jerry, ask him
to give me another chance!

1501
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,410
Help her, Jigar.

1502
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,000
Pull the trigger.

1503
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,410
Sir

1504
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,910
one last chance, please.

1505
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,250
Pull the trigger, Jerry.

1506
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:24,790
No, please give me one more chance.

1507
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:27,000
- Shoot, Jerry.
- Please...

1508
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,870
Please give me another chance.

1509
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,790
I said shoot him.

1510
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,950
Shoot, Jerry!

1511
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,040
Shoot, Jerry!

1512
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:39,450
- Hail Baba Mardanda!
- Hail Baba Mardanda!

1513
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,160
Hello?

1514
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,040
Get the stuff to the restaurant.

1515
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:08,570
We have to go to the restaurant.

1516
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:19,910
Move...

1517
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,200
Yuck, this one's peeing.

1518
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:32,580
The van disappeared?

1519
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,910
Are you crazy?

1520
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:36,040
How can the van disappear?

1521
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,330
We were following them.

1522
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:40,870
They were right in front of us,
and we were following them.

1523
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,910
Find the van!

1524
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,540
The cops haven't caught them.

1525
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,250
The cops have been
searching for them all day.

1526
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,450
Are you double-crossing me, Malik?

1527
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,540
I'm not a loser, Daler.

1528
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:56,040
Had I been interested in the girl,
I would've told the world about it.

1529
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:58,660
I'm not a cheater. I'm straight.

1530
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:01,200
Get me the real stuff
and take the money.

1531
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,700
Else, get lost!

1532
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,160
Enough for now.

1533
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:12,040
Bablu.

1534
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,080
Yes, Bablu?

1535
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,160
Brother... it's not salt.

1536
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,450
That's great...

1537
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:21,790
Double profit.

1538
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:23,330
Superb!

1539
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,620
Brother...

1540
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,080
Yes!

1541
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:28,250
It is sugar. Sugar.

1542
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,160
What?

1543
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:35,080
It is powdered sugar.

1544
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,250
Doesn't this girl feel scared?

1545
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:42,040
Don't you worry,

1546
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:44,540
she may think she's conning us.

1547
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,870
I know how to deal with her.

1548
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,660
Goodbye.

1549
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:02,450
Where have you hidden the stuff?

1550
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:03,580
Hey!

1551
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,000
How dare you hit a woman!

1552
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,120
Be a man and talk to me.

1553
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,700
I have a black belt.
I can take you on.

1554
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:10,000
Shut up!

1555
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,700
Sir...

1556
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,660
I'll tell you the address.

1557
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,250
Please let them go.

1558
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:17,870
What? No.

1559
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,620
Are you mad? They're dangerous.

1560
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,750
Stop this nonsense.

1561
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,580
Sir... please don't.

1562
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:28,750
Sorry.

1563
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:29,870
- Madam...
- Sir.

1564
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,750
Jerry madam,
please give him the address.

1565
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:33,040
I need to go home.

1566
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,500
No...

1567
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:38,250
House number 830, Lane number 3,

1568
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:39,620
Ram Mandir, Jodiwara.

1569
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,370
Repeat it.

1570
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:51,000
Slowly.

1571
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,160
House number 830...

1572
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,080
How much further?

1573
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:57,950
Sayonara.

1574
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,870
Yes, you are right.

1575
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:40,000
This is the real thing.

1576
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:50,750
Who are you?

1577
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:52,660
Tenzin.

1578
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,540
All of you?

1579
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:23,080
What are you doing?

1580
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,080
What are you doing, Mr. Bablu?

1581
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,790
Mr. Bablu...

1582
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:33,200
Stop talking.

1583
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:37,160
I've told you the address.

1584
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,000
You'll get the stuff.

1585
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:40,950
I know how to convince you.

1586
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,160
I'll shoot your mother in the head.

1587
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,660
That should convince you.

1588
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,040
Should I shoot her?

1589
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:58,290
Please call my mother
and sister here.

1590
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,410
What if your men hurt them?

1591
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:05,330
They'll do no such thing.

1592
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:08,290
I'll be very worried about them.

1593
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,540
Please get them here.

1594
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:18,790
Won't it be awkward?

1595
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:21,200
In front of them?

1596
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,450
They're here too.

1597
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,290
- Move.
- I'm not with them. I just hitchhiked.

1598
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,910
Go in.

1599
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,910
Shut up!

1600
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:03,660
I haven't done anything to her.

1601
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:05,040
She's crying already!

1602
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:06,830
Aunty

1603
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:09,120
go to that side of the room
with your daughter.

1604
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:11,080
It'll be over in 10 minutes.

1605
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,830
No. Don't say that, son.

1606
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,410
She's like your sister.

1607
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:18,540
- Let go.
- Little sister.

1608
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:21,000
You are a good boy.

1609
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,620
Let go.

1610
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,450
Let go.

1611
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,040
Mummy.

1612
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:31,200
Find something to hit him with.

1613
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,200
No, son.

1614
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:38,120
I really respect you.

1615
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:39,580
I won't hit you.

1616
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,790
Will you hit me?

1617
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,910
No one will hit you.

1618
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,450
We will.

1619
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:23,120
Kill us instead.

1620
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:39,830
Jerry...

1621
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:41,000
Cherry...

1622
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,450
Sarbati...

1623
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,120
Hi, Uncle.

1624
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,540
Jerry!

1625
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,000
Sir...

1626
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:13,450
Daler sir, good news.

1627
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,330
Jerry and her family
were trying to flee,

1628
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,870
but I've caught them.

1629
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Then get them here.

1630
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,040
- Sure, sir.
- Take care.

1631
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:26,870
It's done, sir.

1632
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:31,620
This is the only way you and
your family can be safe, Jerry.

1633
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,120
Help us catch Daler,

1634
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:36,250
and you and your family can go free.

1635
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,790
Listen to me carefully.

1636
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:42,910
As per the plan, you'll reach
the restaurant with Jassi.

1637
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,700
Undercover cops will be there,

1638
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,290
and they will give me updates.

1639
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,290
Check. Everybody in position?

1640
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:52,660
Yes, sir.

1641
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,330
- Copy.
- Position two copy.

1642
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:57,540
Both of you will go upstairs
and engage Daler.

1643
01:38:58,330 --> 01:39:01,620
Jassi will give me a signal
when Daler appears,

1644
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,040
and we'll nab him.

1645
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,660
This is all you have to do.

1646
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,080
Get it?

1647
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,290
Where are you?

1648
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,200
Daler sir.

1649
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:15,660
Where are you, sir?

1650
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:16,870
Hello...

1651
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,700
Hello?

1652
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:21,540
Keep quiet.

1653
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:22,830
Give me the gun.

1654
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:25,040
Move.

1655
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:34,700
Hello?

1656
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:35,950
Have you reached, Jassi?

1657
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:37,950
Yes, sir.

1658
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:40,450
Left the family behind?

1659
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:00,160
Mummy...

1660
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,700
Why isn't this working? Hello?

1661
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,290
Hello.

1662
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:17,580
The police are surrounded
on all sides.

1663
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:20,370
Put your weapons down

1664
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:23,000
or you'll get your ass kicked.

1665
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,700
Till they are red!

1666
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:26,620
Form a circle.

1667
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,870
Well done. Uncle, you come here.

1668
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,120
This way.

1669
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,870
You, go over there.

1670
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,750
What are you doing?

1671
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:36,040
Want me to shoot?

1672
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,950
This is not a circle, bro.

1673
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:41,040
Form a perfect circle.

1674
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,700
Don't move or I'll shoot.

1675
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,790
Situation under control?

1676
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,660
Uncle

1677
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,290
you can come out now.

1678
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:02,120
Took me for a fool, didn't you?

1679
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:08,160
Shit.

1680
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:15,200
Mummy.

1681
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,290
Mummy.

1682
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:24,870
Move back.

1683
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,750
Do you know who the real fool is?

1684
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,290
There. He's the real fool.

1685
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:33,950
Your admirer.

1686
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,250
Drugs?

1687
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,200
No, sir.

1688
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:45,370
Sir, I know we're safe

1689
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,620
as long as we have the drugs.

1690
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:49,700
Let us go.

1691
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:52,000
You'll get the drugs.

1692
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:56,660
Fine.

1693
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,200
You can leave.

1694
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,330
I have your mother and sister.

1695
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,080
Introduce us at least.

1696
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,500
What's your name, child?

1697
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,160
Cherry.

1698
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:10,450
What?

1699
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,000
Chhaya Kumari.

1700
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:14,120
Chhaya Kumari.

1701
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:17,080
And you?

1702
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,000
Jaya...

1703
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,370
Jaya Kumari.

1704
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:27,950
Welcome to Punjab,
Miss Jaya Kumari.

1705
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:30,660
"Ji aaya nu" as they say in Punjabi.

1706
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,000
Come here,
earn a living and enjoy life.

1707
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:38,910
Or don't.

1708
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,620
What did you think?

1709
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:43,580
That you're the boss now?

1710
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:45,950
No, my child.

1711
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:47,790
I'm the boss here.

1712
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,000
Mummy.

1713
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,120
I'm a non-violent guy.

1714
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:57,120
But I can't help it.

1715
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,370
Work is

1716
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:01,950
worship.

1717
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:13,200
Look, Cherry's boyfriend.

1718
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:14,450
Rubbish.

1719
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:15,870
What the hell is going on?

1720
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:21,330
Stand quietly.

1721
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:24,200
Don't move.

1722
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:27,620
Don't you dare move.

1723
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,450
Is it a gunshot, sir?

1724
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,870
Sir, it's a gunshot!

1725
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:47,700
Jerry.

1726
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:49,000
It's Malik!

1727
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,870
- Duck!
- He is mad!

1728
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:55,000
This girl is a sly one, Malik.

1729
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:58,910
Is he crazy?

1730
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:00,080
A pillow won't stop bullets.

1731
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,290
Cease fire!

1732
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,450
Are you alive?

1733
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:09,620
Speak softly.

1734
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:10,870
Should we go home?

1735
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:13,040
Malik...

1736
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:14,540
Calm down, brother.

1737
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,870
Daler?

1738
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:19,700
Over here, on the left.

1739
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,080
What are you doing?

1740
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,200
Wait, stop!

1741
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:25,750
We're on the same team.

1742
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:28,120
Ram Malik is not on anyone's team.

1743
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,040
Malik is single!

1744
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,950
You're the distributor,
and I'm the supplier.

1745
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,580
Of course we're a team.

1746
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:36,870
Look, we've even got the powder now.

1747
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,040
Come, let's sit and have a chat.

1748
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:40,790
Come on.

1749
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:43,950
Are you trying to fool me?

1750
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,200
Not at all.

1751
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:47,330
You're like my elder brother.

1752
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:49,620
Come with me.

1753
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,950
Here you go.

1754
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:06,040
You were worrying unnecessarily.

1755
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,950
All the powder is here.

1756
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,370
Happy?

1757
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,620
Like the taste?

1758
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:34,540
It's flour.

1759
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,000
It's what?

1760
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:39,700
It's flour!

1761
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,200
All the drugs... It's flour!

1762
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:48,660

Search the place.

1816
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:55,330
Hello...

1817
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,160
Come here.

1818
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:02,190
Where do you think you're going?

1819
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:04,580
Come to the police station.

1820
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:07,950
But we had a deal, sir.

1821
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:14,000
Criminals strike deals,
not the police.

1822
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:15,750
Get it? Come with me.

1823
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:17,330
Sir...

1824
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:20,330
I know where the real drugs are.

1825
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,250
Where?

1826
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:27,790
Your house.

1827
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:31,950
My house?

1828
01:50:34,370 --> 01:50:35,370
Hello.

1829
01:50:35,450 --> 01:50:36,500
How are you, aunty?

1830
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:37,580
Please come in.

1831
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:39,020
Is she getting the pressure points?

1832
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:41,580
Make sure she's satisfied.

1833
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:44,370
Massage her legs properly.

1834
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:46,290
You don't know who brought it?

1835
01:50:46,410 --> 01:50:48,290
I fell asleep after the massage.

1836
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:49,830
Fell asleep?

1837
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:51,750
The house could've been on fire!

1838
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:53,080
Check the cupboard!

1839
01:51:03,450 --> 01:51:04,790
May I leave, sir?

1840
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:12,950
Won't you wish me good luck?

1841
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:24,540
Let's go.

1842
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:29,000
A new world awaits
once you conquer your fears.

1843
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:33,160
You don't need to
take a cab to get there.

1844
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:37,080
All you need
is a little bit of courage.

1845
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:40,450
But once you reach there,

1846
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:42,910
I swear you'll love it.

1847
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:46,660
Luck favoured me.
That's why I'm doling out wisdom.

1848
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:51,160
Otherwise, I'd be dead
along with those gangsters.

1849
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:54,410
Before I sign out,
all I want to say is...

1850
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:58,660
Hail Baba Mardanda!
