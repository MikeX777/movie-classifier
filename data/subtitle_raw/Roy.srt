1
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,200
Papa will drop Teena aunty
at the bus stop and come back.

2
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,400
"Is Teena aunty a small kid
to drop her off?"

3
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
Aww!

4
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,000
Aren't you the big boy now?

5
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,720
Isn't Teena aunty still a kid?

6
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,240
Papa will be back soon.
Ok, dear?

7
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,840
- Good night!
- Ok, good night! - Bye!

8
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,800
- Hello?
- Yeah!

9
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,680
You caught the train?

10
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,320
No. I was a bit late
to leave the office.

11
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,080
Deepak will drop me
at the highway now.

12
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,760
I'll get a bus from there.

13
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,920
If you say roughly
by what time you'll reach,

14
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,600
I'll come to pick you up.

15
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,480
No need to come, Roy!

16
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,800
Just keep the keys
by the window, and go to bed.

17
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,880
'I'll be with you
by the time you wake up."

18
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,320
- Ok, good night!
- Good night!

19
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,760
I thought you would
stay awake and wait for me!

20
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,040
You were the one
who asked me to sleep!

21
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,960
You fell from the
bike again?

22
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,040
Oh! It's alright!

23
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Once you finish writing
your current novel,

24
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
leave your job then.

25
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,760
You don't need to drive
in the traffic anymore, then!

26
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
Even if you feel like
writing something new,

27
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,920
you can be here and write,
full time!

28
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,720
Oh! Is it enough that I simply
sit and write the whole time?

29
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
Only 100 rupees, madam?

30
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
That's what you said earlier!

31
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,600
A bit more for dropping you off
here, in one piece!

32
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,440
Get going if you wanna leave
in one piece!

33
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
Oh!

34
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,960
You didn't keep the keys,
isn't it?

35
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,400
If I keep them,
you wouldn't wake me up!

36
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,280
So?

37
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,280
You fell down
from the bike again?

38
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,400
No! You must've dreamt
about it!

39
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,680
Listen! Let me quickly go
take a bath!

40
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,760
Can you make me
a strong coffee?

41
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,240
Leave it, Roy!
Go make some coffee!

42
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,800
"Someone so close,
without even knowing,"

43
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,280
"Coming to caress,
without even saying,"

44
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,920
"Is it a mere story
in my mind?"

45
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,280
"Or are you the reality
that overwhelms my heart?"

46
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,640
'Regarding the missing case of
Rajagopal, the famous novelist,'

47
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,200
'the hints suggest that
there has been'

48
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,760
'no significant progress
in the investigation.'

49
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
'His son, the ex-MLA...'

50
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,760
Hey,

51
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,320
Once I'm here,
I even turn my phone off!

52
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,760
And you're watching TV?

53
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,400
Have you read his novel?

54
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,800
It's superb!

55
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
"Someone so close,
without even knowing,"

56
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,800
"Coming to caress,
without even saying,"

57
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,640
"Is it a mere story
in my mind?"

58
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,000
"Or are you the reality
that overwhelms my heart?"

59
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,200
"For us, together,"

60
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,680
"To melt away on this land,"

61
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,720
"A zillion lifetimes will bloom!"

62
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,920
'Can you whisper in my ears,
if this is a dream or reality?"

63
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,520
"Is even the reality
fading away like a dream?"

64
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,240
"When the dusk arrives,"

65
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,480
"Let me be the charming moonlight
on your window shades"

66
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,200
"Within these walls,
as a lit candle,"

67
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,080
"Let me yield you warmth."

68
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:49,400
"Let me bloom as a dainty melody,"

69
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,400
"With your fingertips,"

70
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,440
"shower the lyrics on it."

71
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,920
"Let me plant a kiss on
the speck of your forehead,"

72
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,200
"Let me gently rest down
on your lap."

73
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,840
"For us, together,"

74
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,560
"To melt away on this land,"

75
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:51,880
"Will a zillion lifetimes bloom?"

76
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,560
"Am I misreading between
reality and dreams?"

77
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,680
"Is even the reality
fading away like a dream?"

78
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,960
"When the days and nights
extend together, here..."

79
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,000
- "Isn't that Teena's house?"
- "Yeah!" - "Nobody there?"

80
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
"They... were there."

81
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,200
"Don't cry, dear!"

82
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
"Sir, one moment!"

83
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,160
"Mom!"

84
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,640
We daunt him and feed him
by saying that police will come!

85
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
That's why he's crying!

86
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,440
Did they tell you
where they went?

87
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
Uhm... She was there.

88
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,480
She had told that
she would leave today.

89
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,320
I don't know if he went
to drop her.

90
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,920
Yeah! There he is!

91
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,680
I'm here to meet Teena.

92
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,400
Couldn't reach her number.

93
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,440
Well... She was on leave.

94
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,160
She keeps the office phone off
when she comes home.

95
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,040
She has gone back today.
You may reach her now.

96
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,000
Ok!

97
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,640
Well... what was it?

98
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,680
You know the novelist,
Rajagopal?

99
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,560
Teena had posted a photo
with him, on Facebook.

100
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,680
It was on the previous day
of his missing.

101
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,760
I came here to enquire
if Teena knows anything about it.

102
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,280
Okay? See you.

103
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
'Don't cry! No!'

104
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,160
'Aww! Looks like you're sleepy!'

105
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,320
'Shall we go to sleep?'

106
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,320
'See! A cat!'

107
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,280
'The cat's gone! See!
It'll come back now!'

108
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,280
'Looking for Teena...'

109
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,720
Why are you crying?
It's okay!

110
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,840
- Stop crying!
- Hey!

111
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,760
Yes?

112
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,280
When did the police arrive?

113
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,840
You came, right?

114
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,520
Just 5 minutes before that.

115
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,560
Aww! Let's go! Come!

116
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,240
Let's go to sleep!

117
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,800
He has written only four books.

118
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,720
But all of them are bestsellers.
Have you read any, sir?

119
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,840
I've read one, I think...

120
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,720
My wife follows him
quite well, though.

121
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,240
She is a huge fan of him.

122
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,440
That's what.

123
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,160
Anyone who reads his books
will become his fan!

124
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,200
That day, I met him
at the coffee shop unexpectedly.

125
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,440
So I clicked a selfie,
and posted it on Facebook.

126
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,880
Apart from that,
I don't know him personally.

127
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm recording your words
as your statement.

128
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,840
If you have anything more to say,
or pass any information,

129
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,680
- Please call me.
- Sure, sir!

130
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Let's go!

131
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,920
Do you know Rajagopal?

132
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,000
Well! The police asked this
and left just now!

133
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,720
Well, if you could write
a feature about his missing,

134
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,440
it would be of
great demand now.

135
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
He's got health issues
due to his age.

136
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,160
The readers wish that
he returns safely.

137
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,600
Yet, you want this!

138
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,520
Well...

139
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,480
Vinu from the library told me that
his books are out of stock,

140
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
In that angle, there's a scope
for a feature. That's all!

141
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,440
Are we out of other topics, sir?

142
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,840
Let's just leave this aside!

143
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
Of course!

144
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,120
How about your novel?

145
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,000
Will we get to read
it anytime soon?

146
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,840
As if he'll buy and read it
the moment it gets released!

147
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,080
He's simply flattering you!
Such people...

148
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,880
Hey, Deepak!
I just reached my desk.

149
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah!

150
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,200
Continue your work.
Come here in the evening.

151
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,240
I don't think I can, today.
Got some pending work to do.

152
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,800
It's okay. Call me then.

153
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,280
How's your son now?

154
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,480
He's coughing a bit too much.

155
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,400
Gotta take him to a doctor
tomorrow, if it doesn't get better.

156
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Okay!

157
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
- 'Alright then. I'll call you later.'
- Yeah. Okay.

158
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,120
'Just add it to the curry.'

159
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
'Don't burn the chilly too much.
Turn it off!'

160
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,000
- It isn't burnt, mom!
- Burn it, then!

161
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,000
Mom, Teena is here!
I'll call you after dinner.

162
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,560
Hey, Teena!
Did you eat anything?

163
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,960
Looks like she's gonna
test her food on you!

164
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,600
- Aren't you doing fine, aunty?
- Of course! How's Roy?

165
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,160
He's happy. He's good.

166
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,680
Carry on with your things then.

167
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,240
- Bye! - Bye!
- Bye!

168
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,480
Hey! Let me quickly go
and take a bath! Okay?

169
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
Uhm! So you're eating
oats tonight, huh?

170
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,480
No! A nice fish gravy and 'Pathiri'.

171
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,720
Wow! Where did you get them?

172
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,600
Nabeesumma got them for me.

173
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
They know that you'd be gloomy
without me, and won't cook anything!

174
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,560
Well, there's something left
in the fridge.

175
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,560
That's why
I didn't make anything.

176
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,720
What did you have?

177
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,920
Nothing yet.

178
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Soumya has prepared
something.

179
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Wow!

180
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,840
I'm having a slight headache.

181
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,720
I may go to bed early.

182
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,160
But... why headache?

183
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,560
Nothing as such!

184
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,800
Don't start worrying about it!

185
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
I had my works pending,
as I was on leave.

186
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,640
It's because of looking
at the screen for a long time.

187
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
Uhm...

188
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,000
Alright then.
Go to sleep early.

189
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,160
- Okay, sure.
- Call me in the morning, okay?

190
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,680
Oh, sure! Good night!

191
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,760
Bye.

192
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,760
Listen...

193
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,240
I didn't get any appreciation
for cleaning the whole house!

194
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,640
Now if you tell me that
the curry isn't good, I'll kill you!

195
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,560
I sensed it
when I entered the house!

196
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
The smell was 'wonderful'!

197
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Really? Don't eat it, then!
Give me!

198
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,880
I was just kidding!

199
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,480
Listen...

200
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Are you planning to sleep early?
I've got an awesome movie!

201
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,840
Shall we watch it?

202
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,120
No, you watch it.
I'm not in a mood.

203
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,040
Oh, I forgot about that.

204
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,840
Once you're back from home,
you're always like this!

205
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,840
Huh? Huh?

206
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm getting it!

207
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,200
Stop it!

208
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,440
Shall I tell you
where the missing ones are?

209
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,680
On the way from Vazhikkadavu
to Nadukani,

210
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,840
towards the left is Maruthapuzha.

211
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,520
From there, on the way to
Chinnathodu,

212
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,640
after the checkpost,

213
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,840
there's a big board
with an elephant's picture on it,

214
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,920
There's a route to the forest
from there, towards the right.

215
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,600
On that route,
there's an old house.

216
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,760
The missing ones are there.

217
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,080
Hey, shall I tell you
where the missing ones are?

218
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,440
Yeah?

219
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,600
On the way from Vazhikkadavu
to Nadukani,

220
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,680
towards the left is Maruthapuzha.

221
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,120
'From there, on the way to
Chinnathodu,'

222
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,080
there's a big board
with an elephant's picture on it,

223
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,560
There's a route to the forest
from there, towards the right.

224
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,800
On that route,
there's an old house.

225
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,880
The missing ones are there.

226
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,040
Uhm... Roy must've dreamt
about this.

227
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
Take your medicine
and go to sleep.

228
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,000
Okay?

229
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,560
Alright.

230
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,480
Good night.

231
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,960
Hi, chechi!
Good morning!

232
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
Good morning!

233
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,280
The police were here yesterday
to see Teena, I heard?

234
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,960
It's about the novelist,
isn't it?

235
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,000
So? Tell me what it is, Tony!

236
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,760
Nothing as such!
A friend of mine,

237
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,400
told me that he saw him
in a bus to Vazhikkadavu.

238
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,960
Which bus?

239
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,400
Vazhikkadavu.

240
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,760
Well... When did he see him,
you said?

241
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,760
Last Sunday, he said.

242
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,840
There are buses to Vazhikkadavu
from everywhere in Kerala.

243
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,480
All he said is that
he saw him on that bus.

244
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't know anything else, okay?

245
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,240
Where all can we go
from Vazhikkadavu?

246
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,040
From there, Sulthan Bathery,

247
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,720
And, well...
If you get to Nadukani,

248
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,280
from there, Goodalloor,
Ooty, Mysore...

249
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
It's a nice route.
Haven't you gone there?

250
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,560
Hey! Did you reach the office?

251
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,720
Yeah!

252
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,880
Well... I called you
to ask something.

253
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,640
What was your dream
last night?

254
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,640
Why?

255
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,920
Nothing as such.

256
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,480
You woke me up last night
and said something.

257
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,040
Names of some places...

258
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,240
Yeah...

259
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,280
A girl came near our window
and said something.

260
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,840
Well...

261
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,800
Do you remember what she said?

262
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,640
No, dear!

263
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,120
'It was you who asked me
to take my pills and sleep.'

264
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,400
I just woke up.

265
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,640
Okay then. I'll call you later.

266
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,000
Bye.

267
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,680
'Going on a journey, following a dream!'
All credits to my husband!

268
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,560
Hey! Why so early?

269
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,920
Saw a status of yours
in Facebook!

270
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,600
Yeah! I thought of
taking one week's leave.

271
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,600
And the purpose is writing, isn't it?

272
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,240
- Shall I join you?
- No!

273
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,280
I won't disturb you at all!
I'll sit quietly!

274
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,040
Well, did you decide
your destination?

275
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,160
That's a secret!

276
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,240
Something's fishy!
I know!

277
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Think of it that way!

278
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,960
If I tell you now,
you'll say that I'm nuts!

279
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,200
I'd say that
even if you don't tell me!

280
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,320
Hey!

281
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm going then.
I'll take you the next time, okay?

282
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,320
And yes. My files and books...

283
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,840
Don't even touch them!
They're important!

284
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,160
Why do I need them anyway?

285
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,480
- Alright! Bye!
- Bye!

286
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,440
Hi!

287
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
I saw your status!
Why all of a sudden?

288
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,640
You didn't tell me anything!
Is it an official trip?

289
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,200
No, it's personal.

290
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,200
I thought of telling you.

291
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,760
What's there to think so much?

292
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,720
If I tell you this,
you'll come with me.

293
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,920
I can't join you now
anyway.

294
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,440
My son's fever has worsened.

295
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,160
That's why I didn't tell you.

296
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,840
Well... This is an uncertain trip.

297
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,440
If it works out,
it'll be beneficial for both of us.

298
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,240
Anyway,

299
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,960
I'll talk to you in detail
once I'm back. Okay?

300
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,760
Alright. Bye.

301
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,520
It's your personal number.
Where are you off to?

302
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,040
Hey! Didn't you have a dream
last night?

303
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,640
From that, I got a hint
about the places

304
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,840
where Rajagopal sir
could be at.

305
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm gonna carry out
an investigation!

306
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,040
You didn't have this fad
for quite some time!

307
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,520
Yeah! Isn't it been a while, Roy,
that I went on a solo trip?

308
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,560
I... I'm at the bus stop now.

309
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,800
Oh, so you already started, huh?

310
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,400
Well, How's your headache?

311
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,920
That's all gone!

312
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Roy, the bus is about to start.

313
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,720
I'm going. I will call you
once I reach.

314
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,040
Ok? Bye!

315
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,920
But, where are you going?

316
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,480
'Vazhikkadavu'

317
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,880
Were you able to reach her?

318
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,320
No!

319
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,680
She'd be at at some place
with no network.

320
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,520
It isn't that.

321
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,160
Her phone is switched off.

322
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,800
She'll call you!

323
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,480
'By God's will!'

324
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,240
Sir? Remember journalist Teena,
whom we met...

325
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,840
regarding the missing case
of novelist Rajagopal?

326
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Her husband Roy is here,
he says she's also missing.

327
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,200
- Missing?
- Yes!

328
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,120
Suresh told me that he met her
when he went to her office.

329
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,160
Yeah. What should I do, sir?

330
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,440
Do this.

331
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,480
- Ask him to come here.
- Alright, sir.

332
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Hello! Hello!

333
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,520
CI sir is calling you.
Go to that room.

334
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,480
Come. Have a seat.

335
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,120
Your wife is working at
Ernakulam, right?

336
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,720
Why do you think she's missing?

337
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,760
I've not been able to reach
her phone since last evening.

338
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,200
She's gone on a trip.

339
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,160
You have anybody's number
who is with her?

340
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
She went alone.

341
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,440
Did you enquire in her office,
or with her friends?

342
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,880
No use asking them.

343
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,600
They don't know anything.

344
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,880
You're just unable to
reach her on phone, right?

345
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,800
And it's not even 24 hours.

346
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,880
Isn't it too early to conclude
that she's missing?

347
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,160
It's not that, sir.

348
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,000
Something...
has happened to her.

349
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm sure about that.

350
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,040
Roy, right?

351
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,680
Don't get tensed, Roy.

352
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,800
She might be out of coverage area,
or her phone might be damaged.

353
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,720
That could be why
she's not contacting you.

354
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,320
It's not that, sir!

355
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,840
You don't know.

356
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,440
Whatever happens,
she would contact me!

357
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,920
Something has happened to her.

358
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,680
Anyway, lodge a complaint
with all these details.

359
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,200
We'll enquire.

360
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,320
Sir, look at this.

361
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,120
This is Teena's Facebook post,
from yesterday morning 11:22.

362
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,160
She's let everyone know that
she's going!

363
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,640
Yes, sir!

364
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,040
Well, in that novelist's
missing case,

365
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,080
ask Suresh
what her statement was.

366
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,280
And what about that
land infringement case?

367
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,840
- Haven't you asked Saji to come today?
- We've sent people.

368
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
He can't just come and blabber
like the last time!

369
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,800
No, sir! He's a bit snotty!

370
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,280
I'm even snottier then!

371
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,880
'Complaint from Roy Jacob'

372
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,520
I got an urgent meeting.

373
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,880
Will see you after that.

374
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,280
- Haven't you lodged
the complaint? - Yes.

375
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,920
- You gave her number, right?
- Yeah.

376
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,800
Your number too, right?

377
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,760
Yeah.

378
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,240
Then we will investigate
and let you know if there's anything.

379
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,720
Aren't you gonna
investigate now, sir?

380
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Listen...

381
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,720
There's a method of investigation
for each case.

382
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
You've given her number,
right?

383
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,040
We'll track her location through
cyber department, and let you know.

384
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
You may go now.

385
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,920
Hasn't it been a week
since Rajagopal went missing?

386
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,040
You aren't able to
find him yet!

387
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,800
Will this also be like that?

388
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,600
Teena went to him.

389
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,520
How do you know that?

390
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,640
It's me who told her the route.

391
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,520
So, you know
where Rajagopal is.

392
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,080
Interesting!

393
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,240
Couldn't you have told this first?

394
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,320
We could've found both of them!

395
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,440
Enquire thoroughly about his wife,
and about him too.

396
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,080
Ok, sir!

397
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,160
If you find any link
to the missing novelist,

398
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,960
let me and Suresh know.

399
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,160
Sure, sir.

400
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,840
It's not his wife,
he's the one who's missing!

401
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,520
I gave her leave for a week.

402
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,320
She said she has to complete
her novel.

403
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,120
But didn't she go on leave
recently?

404
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,960
Do you let people
go on leave, so often?

405
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,800
Not for everyone.
Teena's language is good.

406
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,240
Besides, her stories have got
a good number of followers.

407
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,160
So if you don't give her leave,
she'd resign, isn't it?

408
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,200
That's right!

409
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,320
She goes on such trips
quite often!

410
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,200
Still, would she just go
without telling anyone?

411
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,720
You and her shared
a good rapport, isn't it?

412
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,520
Well...
Not so much to mention about.

413
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,640
Is there any problem, sir?

414
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,400
Well, we've received a complaint
that she's missing.

415
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,800
She won't be missing, sir!

416
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,160
She goes and comes
as she wishes!

417
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,920
I wouldn't be surprised
if she comes in right now!

418
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,600
'Going on a journey, following a dream!'
All credits to my husband!

419
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,520
'Yes, Suresh?'

420
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,000
Asif sir!

421
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,440
People here say that
Teena often goes on such trips!

422
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,080
Oh!

423
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,480
Besides, who knows!
She'd have some affair!

424
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,480
Did you check
the mobile tower location?

425
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,560
When the phone got switched off,
it was in Mayyanthani area.

426
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,000
We're checking if she's got
any friends there.

427
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,240
Okay, Suresh. I'll call you
in case of any updates.

428
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,440
Alright.

429
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,120
He'd get tensed
if he can't reach Teena on phone.

430
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,280
He's quite a caring person.

431
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,400
Maybe he lodged the complaint
because of that.

432
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,960
Where's her family?

433
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,400
- Family...
- Well...

434
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Are you Teena's friend,
or relative?

435
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,480
I'm the daughter of
her mom's cousin.

436
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,600
Ever since she
got married to Roy,

437
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,760
she got disconnected
from her family.

438
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,160
Alfred uncle, her dad
is in Germany.

439
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,520
But he got married to someone else,
and is settled there.

440
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,800
- In Germany?
- Yeah!

441
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,120
Sir, Saji is not at home!

442
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,280
Let's come back tomorrow again.

443
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
Any update on Teena's case?

444
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
Apart from Roy,
nobody thinks that Teena is missing.

445
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,160
Her friends say that
she often goes on solo trips,

446
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,960
and keeps her phone switched off.

447
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,280
But, isn't it the first time
we're receiving such a complaint?

448
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,880
Yes, sir!

449
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Get into the vehicle.

450
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,320
Did you enquire about her husband?

451
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,120
He lives all alone
in that house.

452
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,160
Sometimes his
wife comes on leave.

453
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,040
Only then he gets out
of the house.

454
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,680
I heard that he doesn't have
any close friends or relatives.

455
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,480
Is this his native?

456
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,840
It's his own house.

457
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,760
He's from
an inherently affluent family.

458
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,240
He had a job earlier,
somewhere far away.

459
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,960
Something seems fishy.

460
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,080
The people around say that
he's got some disorder.

461
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,000
Didn't I tell you?
He's the one missing!

462
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,600
Huh? Hasn't he left yet?

463
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,480
Huh? I saw him leaving!

464
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,280
Guess he came back.

465
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,440
We enquired about
your wife.

466
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,680
It's likely that she went
on her own will.

467
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,200
Don't worry.
She'll be back soon.

468
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,280
Even if she doesn't,
you don't care, isn't it?

469
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,840
Why doesn't he believe when I say that
Teena is in danger?

470
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,760
Teena went in search of
Rajagopal.

471
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,640
I'm sure about it.

472
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,800
When we questioned
Teena,

473
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,080
she said she isn't even
acquainted with him.

474
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,280
It's because he's
an infirm person...

475
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,480
Sir, I'll deal with this.

476
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,040
I got you into this, hoping to get
some link to the novelist case...

477
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,920
This is the book
Rajagopal gifted my wife,

478
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,320
whom you said she isn't
even acquainted with!

479
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,400
See!

480
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,280
'To Teena. Thanks for writing
the book I couldn't write.'

481
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,840
It's not us who said that
she isn't acquainted with Rajagopal.

482
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,800
Teena herself said that.

483
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,040
Why would Teena tell such a lie
to the police?

484
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,080
What if she has said many such lies,
which you don't know about?

485
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,880
Come.

486
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,520
The way I see it,

487
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,160
Teena is quite creative,

488
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,040
She's pretty,
and is active in social media,

489
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,920
and she's quite younger
than you, too.

490
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,200
So, she might be having
a lot of kinships.

491
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,000
You two just don't match
each other, as I see it.

492
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,720
You don't have kids, too.

493
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,960
You don't even stay together
regularly.

494
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,560
Right?

495
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,280
What did she post in Facebook?

496
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,600
'All credits to my husband'

497
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
What does that mean?

498
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,760
'My husband is responsible
for all these'

499
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,720
So if she left you
on her own will,

500
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,640
we can't do anything about it.

501
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,000
Wasn't that a bit too much, sir?

502
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,160
It was intentional.

503
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,840
Until we find Rajagopal
and that girl,

504
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,800
let his name also be there
in the suspect list.

505
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,120
I felt he is a poor soul.

506
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,760
It's because you are one.

507
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,560
You didn't understand that
'all credits' part then.

508
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,600
Let's see!

509
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,520
It's alright. You're continuing
the tablet for pressure, right?

510
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,840
Doctor, last time we gave
these medicines...

511
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,320
- Did you check his BP?
- Yeah, it's normal.

512
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,800
Ok, continue these medicines then.

513
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
One moment!

514
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,320
Take them daily once only.
At night.

515
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,840
- Alright. See you.
- See you.

516
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,440
Let's go! Come!

517
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,080
Did you notice the guy
who was sitting in the corridor?

518
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,760
Who?

519
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,000
The guy reading a book.

520
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,680
I felt something special
about him.

521
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
- The guy who was sitting
on the side?- Yeah!

522
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,520
Either I've seen him before.

523
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,600
Or, I might see him again.

524
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,800
Haven't you left his topic yet?

525
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,680
Had you come a bit late,
I would've found out all his details.

526
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,960
Hey, have you heard of 'Déjà vu'?

527
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,120
Isn't it the feeling that
you've already seen something

528
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,560
that's happening
right now?

529
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,840
I've heard about it.
Hurry up with those veggies!

530
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,440
It isn't something happened before.
Something you've dreamt of before.

531
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,080
When we see that in reality,
it's Déjà vu.

532
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,040
There's such an interpretation, too.

533
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,240
Likewise,

534
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,000
We might have met someone
in our dreams,

535
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,640
who is going to be
very important in our lives.

536
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,800
And when you see them
in real life,

537
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,000
you feel an instant connection,
a spark, isn't it?

538
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,080
You're talking about the guy
who was at the hospital, right?

539
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,000
Look! 'll smash your head
with this!

540
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,880
He doesn't look like someone,

541
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,960
who would read
English romantic novels.

542
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,000
He doesn't even look like someone
who would read a book!

543
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,680
Hello?

544
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,240
Hey, can you do me a favor?

545
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,520
What's it?

546
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,800
From your hospital,

547
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,280
can you get me the details
of the guy we saw the other day?

548
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,920
You got nothing better to do?

549
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,440
Can't you focus on your studies?
Why troubling others?

550
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,040
I'm studying to become a journalist,
not a doctor!

551
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,760
Get this clear, first!

552
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,440
Ok, let me see.

553
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,120
- I'll call you.
- Okay, bye. - Bye!

554
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,600
Brother, a strong coffee.
Without sugar.

555
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,560
Hey...

556
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,160
His name is Roy Jacob.

557
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,800
I've got his details.

558
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,000
I got 2 files.

559
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,760
One from
the psychology department.

560
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,560
It says that he's got some dream issues
and he's a lucid dreamer...

561
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,640
As it's from the psychology department,
it is confidential, you know...

562
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,120
I couldn't obtain much details.

563
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,560
Then I got another file.

564
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,760
Then I got another file.

565
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,680
It's about a treatment he
and his wife had, a few years ago.

566
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,640
His sperm count is low.

567
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,960
He can't have children.

568
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,240
In short,

569
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,240
he's a psycho-messed up case,
whom even his wife left.

570
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,640
Listen...

571
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,320
Leave your 'Déjà vu' stuff aside!

572
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,480
So my expectation wasn't wrong.

573
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,120
No wonder why I felt
a difference when I saw him.

574
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,520
Let me go and do something
that could be of use to someone!

575
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,680
Ok?

576
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,600
Hey...

577
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,120
Did you let go of your 'Déjà vu'?
You don't talk about it anymore!

578
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,920
Can you guess where I spend
all my time in the college?

579
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,480
No need to guess it.
Must be in the library.

580
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,480
You never attend classes, right?

581
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,680
He was working
in the same library for 6 years!

582
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,400
Oh! So you know each other
since then?

583
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,560
How could it be?

584
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,560
He was terminated
a year before I joined.

585
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,520
Now I spend all my time
in the same space he was at!

586
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,120
I heard several stories about him
from the college.

587
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,880
It raised my curiosity.

588
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,920
I got his phone number
and talked to him.

589
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,160
Told that I want to meet him.

590
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,920
- Are you going to meet him?
- Yeah!

591
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,120
He has agreed to meet me
at the park near our college.

592
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,960
Is it?

593
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,760
Awesome plan!

594
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,320
Let me sleep then.
Good night!

595
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,480
The last hour was
Parvathy miss' class, right?

596
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,840
Didn't you attend it?

597
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,600
Isn't it been a while
since you left?

598
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,320
You still remember
the time-table?

599
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,880
Well, you said
you liked her class.

600
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,880
Her class is superb.

601
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,160
But, when did I tell you that?

602
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,920
One tea, uh...

603
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,560
One coffee, strong,
without sugar.

604
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,240
Let's sit there.

605
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,400
The coffee you ordered,
is that for me?

606
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,320
Tell me the truth, Roy!

607
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,120
Do you have any
mind-reading skills?

608
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,480
Didn't you order coffee yesterday?
I thought you're diabetic!

609
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
Oh, no! I'm not a diabetic!

610
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,560
I love the bitterness of coffee.

611
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,960
There's a sweetness
even in that bitterness!

612
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,840
Exactly!

613
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,960
A famous writer said it
about coffee.

614
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,400
How did you see me
ordering coffee yesterday?

615
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,480
We're meeting for the first time
today, isn't it?

616
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,840
Isn't this the third time?

617
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,520
Don't confuse me!

618
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,880
How could that be?

619
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,560
- First, hospital.
- Okay.

620
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,000
- Then, canteen.
- Canteen?

621
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,520
Were you at the canteen
yesterday?

622
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,320
I called you yesterday
and planned to meet today, isn't it?

623
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,880
Is that so?

624
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,240
Maybe then,
the meeting at the canteen was...

625
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,240
a dream of mine!

626
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,040
Oh!

627
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,160
So, what else did you see
in your dream?

628
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,680
You were quite talkative.
You didn't let me talk much.

629
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,200
Stop bluffing!

630
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,240
What else did I say?

631
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,160
Well.. about your family,

632
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,680
about your best friend,

633
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,080
About me?

634
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,000
Yeah! He's not a messed-up case
as you said!

635
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,840
He's a very interesting man!

636
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,600
Really!

637
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,040
You know that I've never been
able to do mind-reading,

638
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,560
no matter
how hard I try?

639
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,120
But he tells me all these
with so much ease!

640
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,640
Are you planning to meet him
again and again?

641
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,040
You got nothing else to do?

642
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,080
Of course!

643
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,800
How could I miss
such a special specimen?

644
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,280
Anyway, it's okay
as his 'count' is low!

645
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,640
You're safe!

646
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:32,040
'Don't close the doors to your eyes,
o' the apple of my eye,'

647
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,920
'when you shine as the beam of my life!'

648
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,840
'like I saw you for ages
with my eyes,'

649
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:54,880
'and saw your glimpses
in my dreams!'

650
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,200
You closed down
your ancestral home,

651
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,960
and is living here all alone.
What's the reason behind that?

652
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,560
I don't have many friends
in my native place.

653
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,280
So you got friends here?

654
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,520
'Blooming as petals,
spilling as a sea,'

655
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,480
'we painted our days.'

656
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,760
'Searching like fingers,
trembling on nudging,'

657
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,480
'our unspoken desires
soared up.'

658
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,440
'When memories shine
as tears in the eyes,'

659
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,920
'sweetness fills in me,
while sinking into you'

660
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,720
- Hey, shall I ask you something?
- Yeah?

661
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,400
Water...

662
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Air...

663
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,680
Fire...

664
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,760
Earth.

665
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,400
Which one would you select?

666
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,600
Why?

667
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,800
I just wanna know,
how romantic Roy is!

668
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,200
- Water.
- Water?

669
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,800
Yes.

670
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,000
Calm, when you look at it.

671
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,280
But when you approach it,

672
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,440
you realize its depth.

673
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,880
The water is usually cold.

674
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,280
But when heated,

675
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,120
it rises as vapour.

676
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,400
Soar up as clouds.

677
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,600
Shower as rain.

678
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,560
As rivers, waves...

679
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,880
And,

680
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,920
it can even turn into a tsunami!

681
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,200
'Don't close the doors to your eyes,
o' the apple of my eye,'

682
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,720
'when you shine
as the beam of my life!'

683
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,120
'Even before meeting,
we met somewhere,'

684
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:17,040
'on some fantasy-era'

685
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,680
'I become an island
that no one looked for,'

686
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,040
'are you showering on me
as the mist?'

687
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,840
'We shall cross the dark woods,'

688
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:37,920
'I shall write myself as a dream
on the book that's you'

689
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,720
'Don't close the doors to your eyes,
o' the apple of my eye,'

690
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:50,120
'when you shine
as the beam of my life!'

691
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
Why are you staring
like this?

692
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,320
It's not a dream!

693
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,440
Nobody else has barged into
my life like you!

694
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,440
People have always left me!

695
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,160
I don't understand,

696
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,560
why someone's wife would leave him,
when he is so romantic!

697
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,320
It's got nothing to do with romance.

698
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,240
She left me when she couldn't
tolerate me anymore.

699
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,480
Are they photos?

700
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,320
Listen...

701
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,160
No need to struggle
and read them all!

702
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,760
I've got a... disorder.

703
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,200
I've consulted several doctors,
and these are those files.

704
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,560
Even they
haven't been able to...

705
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,800
diagnose it correctly.

706
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,480
But I'm clear about it.

707
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,280
My dreams, reality,

708
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,040
imagination, they're all mixed up,

709
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,040
and are stored in a jumbled form,
in my mind.

710
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,520
It's quite difficult
to differentiate between them!

711
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,480
But, isn't that awesome?

712
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,800
Not as awesome as you think!

713
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,200
Suppose what happened
between us last night was a dream,

714
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,640
what'd happen if I behave
with the same freedom,

715
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,120
the next time we meet?

716
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,440
Wouldn't our relation end
that very moment?

717
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,520
Get ready.
I'll get you a coffee.

718
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,040
My condition is not as simple
as you think.

719
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,240
It's very difficult for me
to mingle with others,

720
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,120
in my daily life.

721
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,720
It could get so unbearable
for others.

722
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,080
That's why I decided to live alone.

723
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,800
No matter how hard I try,
sometimes I lose it.

724
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,040
And I become a mentally ill man
in front of others.

725
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,920
One life is all we've got.

726
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,400
What's the point in living it
the way everyone else does?

727
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,960
You two are the strangest people
I've ever met.

728
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,320
I've always felt that
she is even crazier.

729
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,040
You are used to living alone.

730
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,440
You should keep in mind that
she got all alone, only for you.

731
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,000
But these cops don't understand it!

732
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,680
Aren't you ashamed to feel dejected,
listening to some random cops?

733
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,000
Don't let her know about
all these.

734
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,120
You would understand, but...

735
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,520
how do I make others understand?

736
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,920
Roy!

737
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,000
Come out of
your complexes first!

738
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,840
She used to always
tell me there's some truth in,

739
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,960
your dreams and intuitions!

740
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,160
That's the reason why
she went looking for that novelist!

741
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,800
No matter how hard I try,
I'm unable to recollect

742
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,520
the place names
I told Teena that night!

743
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,680
It's your sole responsibility
to find Teena without any harm!

744
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,280
You can challenge those people
who don't understand your relation,

745
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,480
and find Teena
without anybody's help!

746
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,960
Only you can do it, Roy!

747
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,560
The bond that I and Teena share
can't be measured with your police brain!

748
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,440
I'm sure that she won't leave me!

749
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,880
I wanted to come and
tell you this.

750
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,640
That's why I came right now.

751
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,280
Otherwise,
I won't be able to sleep!

752
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,120
You don't believe
what I said, right?

753
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,920
I'll search and find Teena!

754
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,920
I thought she went on a casual trip,
when I commented on the post.

755
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,080
As it is Roy who lodged
the complaint,

756
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,800
don't take it lightly.

757
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,840
I know them personally
for many years.

758
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,080
Their emotional bond is
at a level nobody can guess.

759
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,520
- Inquest Deepak in person.
- Okay, sir.

760
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,280
- Isn't he the guy with a publishing house
and a coffee shop? - Yeah!

761
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,800
Ask Suresh, if Teena and Rajagopal
met in that coffee shop.

762
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,800
Okay. Sure.

763
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,560
Hello! Isn't Deepak here?

764
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,040
No, sir. He's gone out.
Why, sir?

765
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,520
Oh! Okay!

766
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:18,160
Teena spend more time
in this office, than with me.

767
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,680
It's been 2 days
since Teena went missing.

768
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,800
We will enquire. Relax, Roy.

769
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,440
Teena would call you
anytime from now. I'm sure about it.

770
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,280
Her phone is switched off
since last two days.

771
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,040
The last time she called, she said
that she's going to meet the novelist.

772
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,800
You got any info about it?

773
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,200
Listen... 'SI Suresh, Ernakulam'
called you twice.

774
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,040
Well... Keep it there.

775
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,920
- Okay.
- I'll call him back after this.

776
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,640
Yes, sir.

777
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,120
Sir, as you thought,

778
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,000
that photo was clicked
at Deepak's shop.

779
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,560
I too feel that these
two missing cases are connected.

780
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,680
Once one gets resolved,
the other one too should.

781
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,080
I'll get in touch with
all other friends of Teena.

782
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,040
Let's see if we get
any info.

783
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,760
Rajagopal and Teena
are close friends,

784
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,400
and they are writers, too.

785
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,400
And both of them are missing now.

786
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,120
Is there any connection
between these two?

787
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,800
What do you think, Deepak?

788
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,800
Well... that...

789
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,280
I mean...

790
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,120
Well...

791
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,120
Why did Teena
lie to the cops that

792
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,280
she isn't acquainted with
Rajagopal?

793
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,880
Are you acquainted with Rajagopal?

794
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,760
He is Teena's friend.

795
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,160
I've read his books, too.

796
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,000
That's all I know about him.

797
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,600
One moment.

798
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,440
Hello?

799
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,760
Please hold for a moment.

800
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,680
Yes, tell me.

801
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,840
Hey, listen.

802
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,280
I had told Teena that,

803
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,040
Rajagopal was seen
in a bus to Vazhikadavu.

804
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,960
I think she took it a bit seriously.

805
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,960
She took leave
and left the same day.

806
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,440
What if Teena went looking for
Rajagopal sir?

807
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,800
That's what I feel.

808
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,320
Her husband came here
and made a fuss about it.

809
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,040
He also kept saying
this same thing.

810
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,640
In that case, let me enquire.

811
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,200
He is here with me, now.

812
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,400
Nothing to worry, right?

813
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,440
'No!'

814
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,240
- Alright!
- I'll call you later.

815
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,280
'Selvi by Rajagopal'
'To Deepak, with love. Rajagopal'

816
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,760
Teena introduced me to
Rajagopal sir.

817
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,840
The novel that Teena is writing now,
is based on Rajagopal sir's life.

818
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,840
We were about to
launch her book

819
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,720
through my publishing
company, next month.

820
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,680
It was then that
Rajagopal sir went missing,

821
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,800
and all these problems started...

822
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,200
We had signed a contract
with Rajagopal sir,

823
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,720
that nobody will get to know
about this, until the book releases.

824
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,920
Maybe that's why,

825
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,560
Teena lied to the cops
that she doesn't know him well.

826
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,000
Teena strongly wished to settle down
with you, as early as possible.

827
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,120
And I'm in debt due to the loan
I took for starting this company.

828
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,960
It was the necessity of Teena and I,
to release that book soon.

829
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,560
['Let it be' by The Beatles]
'When I find myself in times of trouble,'

830
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,720
'Mother Mary comes to me,'

831
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,600
'Speaking words of wisdom,
let it be'

832
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,480
'And in my hour of darkness,'

833
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,480
'she is standing right in front of me'

834
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:33,200
'Speaking words of wisdom,
let it be'

835
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,240
'Let it be, let it be,'

836
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,560
'let it be,'

837
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,680
'let it be'

838
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,760
How do you find it
till now?

839
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,440
Liked it?

840
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,920
It's good!

841
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,920
It's very interesting that
you fictionalized it.

842
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,400
So I was right.
It's a hit!

843
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,640
Why don't you
finish it quickly, then?

844
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,240
Isn't that why
I went in search of him?

845
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,920
You didn't tell me that
this was the purpose.

846
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,320
Well...

847
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,120
I thought of letting it be
a surprise for you.

848
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,400
Surprise!

849
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,880
Why do you keep
your phone switched off?

850
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,200
Isn't that why I get worried?

851
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,760
I had lost my phone.

852
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,920
Someone pushed me from behind,
while at the forest.

853
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,080
I was about to come to you.

854
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,560
I got some info to share.

855
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,120
I have some documents,

856
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,760
related to the life of
Rajagopal.

857
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,720
The school in which he studied,

858
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,400
his friends,
the places he visited,

859
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,280
the awards he received,
all such things.

860
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,240
Here!

861
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,520
So this is how Teena
and Rajagopal are connected.

862
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,320
Teena's been writing a book
based on the life of Rajagopal.

863
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,880
It was about to be published
through Deepak's company, soon.

864
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,640
Why is such a great novelist's
life story

865
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,320
being written so secretly?

866
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,800
As someone who's in touch
with huge publishing houses,

867
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,960
why would he publish it
through Deepak's small company?

868
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,560
So, he's got some secrets
to reveal, through this book.

869
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,400
And when the novel was
almost finished,

870
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,160
both of them went missing.

871
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,280
Somebody who doesn't want
these secrets to be revealed,

872
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,560
is behind this.

873
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,960
Who?

874
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,960
It's not my job to investigate it.
It's the job of the police!

875
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,240
Rather than wandering around
in my backyard,

876
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,120
please investigate this.

877
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,040
The lives of two people
are in danger.

878
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,440
Get out of your dreams,
and turn on the TV.

879
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,600
Rajagopal was found
last evening.

880
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,320
Things are not as you think.

881
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,520
Rajagopal went looking
for some relative.

882
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,560
Somebody informed his family,
when he was found lost and worn out.

883
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,200
He's admitted in the hospital now.

884
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,720
Hasn't it been 3 days
since your wife left?

885
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,560
No info about her yet.

886
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,400
That means, as I said,

887
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,000
she went on her own will.

888
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,840
And if at all there's somebody
behind all these,

889
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,080
I'll get hold of him!

890
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,800
What was the reason for
Rajagopal sir to go like this, now?

891
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,600
He's been facing old age issues
for quite some time,

892
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,320
So we don't let him go
anywhere alone, usually.

893
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,920
Was he trying to write
anything new, lately?

894
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,440
Heard such a news.

895
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,760
He had expressed
such a desire,

896
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,800
But his health issues
are a big factor...

897
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,720
How's his health now?
Is there any hope?

898
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,720
What are you hoping for,
actually?

899
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,400
His life was as mysterious
as his novels.

900
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,320
The last book he wrote was
'Selvi', in 1995.

901
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,160
When asked about if
he'd continue writing,

902
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,520
his answer was that
'one more book will be released.'

903
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,040
Despite his fans waiting
for over 20 years,

904
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,320
he wasn't ready to write, yet.

905
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,960
- Soumya!
- Yeah!

906
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,480
I don't think
you'd be able to see him.

907
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,280
The media and cops
are also not allowed.

908
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,720
He's under the control
of his family now.

909
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,400
If we could meet his relatives,
to get any info.

910
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,200
Even the media with
the same request was asked to leave.

911
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,000
Besides, his condition is
a bit serious.

912
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,040
He might be moved to
the ventilator soon.

913
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,120
Well, if we wait for some time,
would it help?

914
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,600
You may leave now.
I'll call you.

915
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,000
Okay.

916
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,280
I'll call Suresh and get
the investigation report of Rajagopal.

917
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,880
We'll get an idea about
the places Rajagopal visited.

918
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,080
Good.

919
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,880
If Teena went in search of
Rajagopal, she'd be somewhere there.

920
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,200
Yeah. Right!

921
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,840
Hearing the news of his return,
chances are that she may return!

922
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,160
But...

923
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,160
Isn't her phone switched off
since last 3 days?

924
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,200
Looking at it that way,

925
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,720
What if there's some truth
in Roy's words?

926
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,120
Tell me clearly.

927
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,280
What if somebody kidnapped
Rajagopal?

928
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,320
What if they attacked, silenced
and left him there?

929
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,240
I understand your angle.

930
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,680
If so, Teena would be under
the custody of those who harmed him.

931
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:36,680
Right!

932
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,920
As long as Teena can't come out,
this novel too won't.

933
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,240
Right, sir!

934
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,840
Yeah! How did it go?

935
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,080
Saji is still in Chennai,
his wife says.

936
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,240
Would we have to go to
Chennai now?

937
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,200
No, sir. We will consider this
seriously.

938
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,160
- It's better if you follow up.
- Sure, sir.

939
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,880
- You may get into the vehicle.
- Sir!

940
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,840
But then, couldn't they
just finish them off?

941
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,080
Maybe all they want is
to stop that book's release!

942
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,280
You read a lot of thrillers, right?

943
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,880
I watch such movies, sir!

944
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,480
Well!

945
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,160
Let's go!

946
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,640
Hi! Aren't you Teena's husband?

947
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,080
I'm a relative of writer Rajagopal.

948
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,960
I'm the one who stays with him
in the hospital.

949
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,920
He's been making a fuss
about getting you there, right now!

950
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,920
Wanted to discuss
something important, he said.

951
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,200
In the morning,
the place would be crowded.

952
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,720
Well...

953
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,240
can he speak?

954
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,560
The TV reports said that
he's in the ventilator.

955
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,080
It's all just a sham!

956
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,040
He'll be killed the moment
they know that he can speak!

957
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,840
That's why he lies down
silently.

958
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,240
Why so?

959
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,440
If he starts speaking,
he'll shout out everything!

960
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,960
Whatever they did back then!

961
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,600
As he feels guilty now!

962
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,280
Hey...

963
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,280
Don't go that way.
There's a security guard.

964
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,440
There's an ATM.

965
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,200
Let's go that way,
without anyone noticing.

966
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,600
That way. Get in.

967
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,720
This is my condition now.

968
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:27,280
I can't speak to anyone.

969
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,120
Please ask Teena to...

970
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,920
finish writing that novel
somehow.

971
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,200
Who's that?

972
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,560
Stay right there.

973
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Hello!

974
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,440
Yes?

975
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,040
I told the police about last night,
and they've gone inside.

976
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,120
What?

977
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,680
Last night...

978
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,040
Sorry, I think you got the wrong person.

979
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,640
He isn't reacting to medicines.

980
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,320
There's multiple organ damage, too.

981
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,600
He wasn't eating or drinking
for more than a week, right?

982
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,280
Yeah.. Okay.

983
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,080
Any chances of him to speak?

984
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,480
No.

985
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:28,280
We're trying to extend his life
somehow.

986
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,040
Okay! Let's go!

987
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,560
Okay.

988
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,920
Why are you so irresponsible?

989
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,560
- Sir!
- Will call you!

990
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,200
Sir, let me get the vehicle!

991
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,160
Sir!

992
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,040
Teena's phone is ringing, sir.

993
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,200
Please try, sir.

994
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,800
Get into the vehicle, you!

995
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,520
It was ringing, sir!

996
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,880
Okay.

997
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,800
Sir, it was really ringing.

998
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,200
Don't you dare say a word!

999
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,240
You should get admitted
to a hospital, if you're mentally ill!

1000
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,480
You should be put behind the bars
for cooking up stories

1001
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,480
against such a famous novelist!

1002
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,440
We should be blamed for listening to
his words and coming all the way here!

1003
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,880
Drive towards that
secluded road.

1004
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,040
Yeah.

1005
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,400
You can say whatever, sir!

1006
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,240
But, hadn't I lodged a complaint?

1007
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,280
Did you investigate?

1008
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,840
Where is Teena?

1009
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,600
What crosses my mind is something else!

1010
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,680
I wonder how she managed
to live with you all these days!

1011
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,040
Such cases should be closed,
stating that she just left her husband.

1012
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,720
Enough, sir!

1013
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,160
You've said this before, too.

1014
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,720
I went to his house the other night,
and gave a nasty reply.

1015
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,640
So, he is a bit annoyed with me
because of that.

1016
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,200
You're not able to find Teena
because it's still in his mind.

1017
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,040
What are you talking about?

1018
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,320
You can't just enter the flat
where he lives.

1019
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,960
There are security guards.

1020
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,760
Without his permission,
nobody can enter that place.

1021
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,760
He's been scolding you
because you babble such things!

1022
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:01,920
Come on. Hop in.

1023
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,400
You may take your car
and go home.

1024
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,480
I gotta go to the station.

1025
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:09,440
And...

1026
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,960
Eventhough sir just keeps saying
whatever he feels,

1027
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,280
he's a very capable officer.

1028
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,600
I know that
my disorder can cause

1029
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,320
difficulties and
confusion to others.

1030
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:25,840
But...

1031
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,440
To tell me what's real
and what's not,

1032
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,200
all I have is my Teena.

1033
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,880
In the eyes of others,
I may be mentally ill.

1034
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,680
Do you remember him
hurting my feelings, at the police station?

1035
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,320
By mentioning that
Teena just left me?

1036
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:51,880
What if,

1037
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,800
I believe it and imagine
or dream about it?

1038
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,960
My brain would then tell myself,

1039
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,320
that it's the truth!

1040
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,760
Luckily I met Teena's friend
Aswathy on the road.

1041
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:11,200
She is the only one who knows
the depth of our relationship.

1042
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,240
With the motivation
that she gave me,

1043
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,440
I went ahead
and started investigating it.

1044
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,240
But now...

1045
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,160
No matter whether you
close this case or not,

1046
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:37,120
I gotta find my Teena, right?

1047
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,160
Hello, doctor?

1048
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,640
I'm Asif, who's investigating
Teena's case.

1049
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,000
Yeah. Tell me.

1050
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,760
You got any info?

1051
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,920
Not yet. Where are you now?

1052
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,600
You said you were in Delhi, right?

1053
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,280
Did you come here
recently?

1054
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,880
No, I'm still in Delhi.
What happened?

1055
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,080
Well... Nothing, doctor.

1056
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,880
I'll call you later.
Thank you.

1057
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,120
Okay. Yeah.

1058
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,640
Sir! They had called
from the cyber cell, twice.

1059
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,520
Asked you to call them back
urgently.

1060
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,120
I'll call them.

1061
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,080
Sir, Teena's number was switched on
for some time, this afternoon.

1062
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,280
- No calls were made, though.
- Is it? - Yeah.

1063
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,960
Did you trace the location?

1064
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,240
It's a forest area
near Tamilnadu border.

1065
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,400
Chinnathodu.

1066
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,080
Whatsapp me the location
immediately.

1067
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,520
- Okay?
- Okay, sir!

1068
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,800
Yes, sir!

1069
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,600
Hello? Brother?

1070
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,280
Yes, Deepak.

1071
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,320
Don't expect anything
from the police now.

1072
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,880
They say that
Teena just left me.

1073
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,240
D.. Deepak...

1074
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:52,680
Listen to me carefully,
and trust my words.

1075
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:57,000
I'm sure that Teena is
inside the forest.

1076
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,720
She told me that
she lost her phone there.

1077
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,920
Even he told me the same,
at the hospital.

1078
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,400
Not just that,

1079
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,520
It's written in Teena's book that
he and his friends go hiking in the forest.

1080
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,520
Well... Brother...

1081
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,800
I've reached Vazhikkadavu now.

1082
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,520
Tracing
Rajagopal sir's route,

1083
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,240
and Teena's last tower location,
I came here.

1084
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,880
Now,

1085
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,760
as you said, it is a forest area
from here.

1086
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:25,440
Yeah...

1087
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,720
Can you tell me your location?
I'll come there.

1088
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,920
There's a guesthouse
of a friend of mine.

1089
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,320
I'll give you the address.

1090
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,640
And,

1091
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,680
They don't let the cars in,
after 6PM.

1092
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:38,560
You may come tomorrow morning.
I'll be here.

1093
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,720
Hello?

1094
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,320
Hello?

1095
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:46,840
Brother?

1096
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,160
Hello?

1097
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,960
'Shall I tell you
where the missing ones are?'

1098
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:03,840
[Indistinct instructions]

1099
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,400
Chandran!

1100
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,480
Yes, sir!

1101
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,160
Have you seen this person?

1102
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,840
Who's it?

1103
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,680
It's a missing case,
from town.

1104
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,440
She... I was about to call you.
Just a moment.

1105
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,960
Sir! Chirutha got this
from the forest.

1106
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,760
She gave it to me
when I was on rounds.

1107
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,080
Thought of giving it to you
when I come to town.

1108
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,080
It was switched off
when I got it.

1109
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,080
When I woke up,
I turned it on once.

1110
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,520
And when a call came, I turned it off

1111
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:01,400
Hello?

1112
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,480
Sir! Teena's phone
is in Chinnathodu station.

1113
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:30,400
We'll have to issue a search order for
at least 3km around that tower location.

1114
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,760
- I'll get it done.
- Okay, sir!

1115
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:35,640
Pass this info to all stations
on that route.

1116
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,160
Sure, sir.

1117
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,960
As Roy said,
I sense a threat to her.

1118
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,920
Did you call and inform him?

1119
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,120
No, sir. As we didn't get
a clear picture...

1120
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:47,240
What if the clear picture
is disastrous?

1121
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,600
He's the complainant, too!

1122
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,560
Call him and inform this
right now!

1123
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,880
Hello?

1124
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,440
It's me, SI Asif.

1125
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,880
Please come to the station
at 10AM.

1126
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,720
Got an info to share.
Wanted to discuss it in person.

1127
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,880
Sir, I'm on the way to Chinnathodu.

1128
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,120
Chinnathodu?

1129
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,120
Yes. Teena is in
some forest nearby there.

1130
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,080
How do you know that?

1131
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,680
Hello?

1132
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,240
Sir, he is on the way
to Chinnathodu, he says!

1133
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,320
How did he get to know
that location?

1134
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,760
That's what even I'm wondering.

1135
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,600
When we got into
the right path,

1136
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,720
is he playing
a different trick now?

1137
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,160
How did you come here?

1138
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,520
In my car.

1139
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,800
Let me get ready.

1140
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,440
- Let's reach Chinnathodu
as quick as possible. - Okay, sir.

1141
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,560
- Isn't this SI Manikandan?
- Yes! - I'm the CI.

1142
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:49,240
Tell me, sir.

1143
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,080
We don't know
what the situation would be.

1144
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,720
The ambulance and
medical team should be ready.

1145
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,960
Sure, sir. We're already here.

1146
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,600
Sir, don't we have to
inform the checkpost?

1147
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,240
I'll call them.

1148
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,400
Yeah.

1149
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,600
Yes, sir. What was the color
of the car? A green one?

1150
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,920
Yeah. A light green...

1151
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,400
- well... Padmini.
- Number?

1152
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,080
8585. Right?

1153
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,000
Yes, sir.

1154
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,440
Yeah.

1155
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,800
Shall we block him, sir?

1156
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,560
Yeah, stop him for just a while.

1157
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,200
- We'll reach by then.
- Alright, sir.

1158
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,680
Let him go only when
we ask you to.

1159
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,080
Okay, sir.

1160
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:32,720
'Chinnathodu'

1161
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:22,840
Ask SI Manikandan
to come here.

1162
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,800
I've shared the live location, sir.

1163
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,840
Are SI Manikandan and team here?

1164
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,480
Yes, sir. They're here.

1165
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,240
Yeah.

1166
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,160
Please go search in there.

1167
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,400
Okay, sir!

1168
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,040
Hey! Look inside
these rooms!

1169
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,560
Sir, a room is locked here.

1170
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:21,960
Just force it open!

1171
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,600
Check if she's breathing!

1172
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,400
Ask them to get the stretcher!

1173
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,080
Hey! Where are you going?
Move aside!

1174
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:40,960
Take him away!

1175
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,960
- Come here!
- Entering a crime scene and...

1176
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,280
T.. there...

1177
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,480
Move the hands.

1178
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,920
- Sir, it's Teena!
- Move her away from the dirt.

1179
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,880
Hasn't the stretcher
arrived yet?

1180
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,080
Ask them to hurry up!

1181
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,800
Come on! Hurry!

1182
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,320
Go! Go!

1183
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:22,640
Place her on it.

1184
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,240
Keep the hand properly.

1185
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,240
Okay!

1186
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,120
Careful! Slowly!

1187
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,560
You didn't expect us here,
did you?

1188
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,800
When did you
dump her here?

1189
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,040
Rajagopal and his friends
killed and buried someone here,

1190
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,440
years back!

1191
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:10,880
All these are happening
so that this news doesn't go out!

1192
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,240
How many times did I tell you,

1193
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,200
that Teena's life is in danger?

1194
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,200
- Get the complete history
of this house. - Sir!

1195
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:42,680
Who owned this place,
who is the current owner...

1196
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:43,960
Okay, sir.

1197
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:47,280
And the forest guard
who got her phone,

1198
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,040
- Yeah.
- Question him, too.

1199
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:49,680
Ok.

1200
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:52,400
We should know
if anybody used to visit here.

1201
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,200
Ok.

1202
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:56,720
Only once we know the details
and history of Rajagopal and his friends,

1203
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,040
we can assure if Roy has
a point or not.

1204
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,000
Ok.

1205
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,840
If any of them are connected
to this forest or house in anyway,

1206
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,480
gotta find that, too.

1207
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,600
Why did Teena come to this forest?

1208
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,000
How did Roy spot it
correctly?

1209
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,920
Anyway, get her statement
once she's conscious.

1210
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:16,440
Ok, sir.

1211
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,080
- And follow it up correctly.
- Sure.

1212
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,960
Okay, thank you!

1213
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,720
Teena!

1214
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,240
Aren't you okay?

1215
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,560
You got any difficulty
in speaking?

1216
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,480
The police officers
are here.

1217
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:53,880
They want to meet you.

1218
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,880
Okay?

1219
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:09,760
Teena?

1220
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,200
On the other day, you said
you didn't know Rajagopal personally.

1221
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:17,600
The book that I'm writing
is based on his life.

1222
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:20,440
I had an agreement that
I'd keep it a secret.

1223
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,240
Why did you go inside the forest?

1224
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:28,560
I was hoping to find Rajagopal sir
and complete my book.

1225
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:32,120
What happened inside the forest?

1226
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:36,560
I felt like somebody was
following me.

1227
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,160
Somebody pushed me down
from behind.

1228
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,080
When I regained consciousness,
I was in that house.

1229
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:44,120
Oh...

1230
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:48,760
Was your book revealing any secrets
related to Rajagopal's life?

1231
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:54,600
As per his words,
such things are there.

1232
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,200
But he didn't tell me
what they are.

1233
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,880
So I don't know.

1234
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,520
These are hard to believe.

1235
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,000
Did the doctor say
anything else?

1236
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,400
No, sir.

1237
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:08,560
There's been no sign of
physical abuse, or attempt to it.

1238
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:11,120
She's worn out due to
not eating for all these days.

1239
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,720
She'll get discharged
today, or tomorrow.

1240
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,200
Roy's tower location didn't change,
unlike you suspected.

1241
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,320
On those days,
he was at home itself.

1242
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:25,240
The neighbors too confirmed it.

1243
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:28,480
SI Manikandan sir had called.

1244
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,920
The forest guard doesn't know
anything in particular.

1245
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:34,720
And he says it's a haunted house!

1246
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,440
Did you check the owner
of the house?

1247
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,880
The legal papers, history,
such things?

1248
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:43,040
Somebody encroached that land
and built it.

1249
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:44,840
The department
recaptured it later.

1250
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:48,400
Manikandan sir and forest
department are investigating it.

1251
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,640
There's another info.

1252
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,840
The college in which Rajagopal
studied,

1253
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,080
It is just 15KM away from
this forest.

1254
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:57,560
And...

1255
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:00,480
The tales we heard about him
weren't quite decent!

1256
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,480
So, you suggest that,

1257
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,800
we should take Roy's words
into account, and investigate the case?

1258
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,160
Why do we have to
investigate it, sir?

1259
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,200
The missing ones are back.

1260
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:20,600
And about the house,

1261
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,840
let the police from that area
investigate it.

1262
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,160
But yet,

1263
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,920
what if Roy's words are true?

1264
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,280
There is a villain in this case.

1265
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:38,240
The one who shut
Rajagopal quiet,

1266
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,000
and the one
who locked Teena up.

1267
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:44,600
You do this.

1268
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:48,080
Get me all the details
related to both these cases.

1269
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:49,440
Alright.

1270
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,160
And Asif,

1271
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:56,200
Get me the phone numbers
of everyone involved in this.

1272
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:58,040
Let me see.

1273
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,240
Okay.

1274
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,040
Deepak had called.

1275
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,720
Rajagopal sir...

1276
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:53,200
There's no hope left
for his recovery, he said.

1277
02:00:56,840 --> 02:01:00,080
If you're gonna tell me about
going back to your job immediately,

1278
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:01,760
I don't wanna hear it.

1279
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,920
I resigned from my job.

1280
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:11,920
I'm not going back there.

1281
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,120
It isn't a dream, Roy!

1282
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,680
I've decided to complete
that book.

1283
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:23,160
Deepak has informed the media
about this.

1284
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:26,040
Whatever I wrote till now...

1285
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,840
was based on
what Rajagopal sir told me.

1286
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,600
I'll continue writing
with what Roy told me.

1287
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:36,080
Until I finish writing it,
can you be with me?

1288
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,920
Let me go check.

1289
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,440
I'm CI Ajith.

1290
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,000
I was there at the location
that day.

1291
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,000
How's your health now?

1292
02:01:58,040 --> 02:01:59,880
Alright. It's fine.

1293
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,080
Heard that your book
is getting released.

1294
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:03,880
So are you done with
writing?

1295
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:06,280
The last portions
are in progress.

1296
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,480
We gotta release the book
as early as possible.

1297
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,400
Your statement
says that,

1298
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:14,480
Rajagopal didn't tell you anything
about the final portions.

1299
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:17,080
And you went there,
looking for it.

1300
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:19,640
Then, how will you
complete it?

1301
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:28,880
Teena...

1302
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:31,040
you were assaulted,

1303
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:33,200
and Rajagopal was put
in this condition.

1304
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,240
There's someone behind this.

1305
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,640
Don't you have any desire
to bring them before the law?

1306
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:44,520
I intend to do that also,
by publishing this book.

1307
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:48,400
In that case,
you know what it is!

1308
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:50,920
Why don't you share it
with us then?

1309
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:55,320
See...

1310
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,640
Roy is the one
who told me all these.

1311
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:01,760
How can I share them as
authentic statements then?

1312
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,480
And then,

1313
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:07,480
as it is my book, I have the freedom
to write whatever I want.

1314
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,960
What Roy told me is that,

1315
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,920
Rajagopal and his friends killed
and buried someone in that house.

1316
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:17,320
In that case, are the co-convicts
behind all these?

1317
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,000
Anyway, it'll all be
in the book, right?

1318
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,680
Let the book get released then.

1319
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:28,080
If its contents are true,

1320
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:30,040
whoever's hiding now
will come out!

1321
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:31,840
If not, we will get them out!

1322
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,800
You know that the college
where Rajagopal studied

1323
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:39,000
is near that forest,
right?

1324
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:41,600
- Yeah.
- I had inquired about it.

1325
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:46,520
We've got a report of the people
who went missing during those years.

1326
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,320
Around 18 missing cases were
registered in that area back then.

1327
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:53,000
In 15 cases,
people either returned,

1328
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:55,040
or convicts were arrested
and the cases closed.

1329
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:58,280
In the remaining 3 cases,
we haven't got any hints yet.

1330
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,040
These are the copies
of those case files.

1331
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,000
Means,

1332
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:06,560
The one who was killed
and buried by Rajagopal and friends,

1333
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:09,000
is someone from these files.

1334
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:12,120
There is a chance.

1335
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:26,040
What she told me
that day was,

1336
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:27,920
the trail to find herself.

1337
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:34,760
Shall I tell you where
the missing ones are?
