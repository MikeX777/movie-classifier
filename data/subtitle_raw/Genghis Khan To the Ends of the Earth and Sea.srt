1
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:05,780
A Japan-Mongolia co-production
commemorating the 800th anniversary
of the founding of Mongolia

2
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:28,039
Haruki Kadokawa & Ryuhei Chiba
present

3
00:00:51,835 --> 00:01:00,675
GENGHIS KHAN
To the Ends of the Earth and Sea

4
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:26,192
The Mongolian clans
had formed into tribes.

5
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:33,772
Tayichi'ut, Tatar,
Merkit, Mongol, Kerait.

6
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:41,381
The tribes were many,
and constantly at war.

7
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:01,802
Shall we rest?

8
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,033
Let's go as far as we can before dark.

9
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:11,238
This is still Mongol land.

10
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:12,403
Chiled!

11
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,813
They're coming back!

12
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,605
It's me they want!

13
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:42,608
Have no fear!

14
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:43,473
I'll protect you.

15
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:44,739
No!

16
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,779
You must live...

17
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:50,277
to take me back.

18
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,279
Hoelun!

19
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,448
I'll come for you!

20
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:56,848
Wait for me!

21
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:20,082
I am Yesukhei Baghatur. Mongol,
Chief of the Borjigin clan.

22
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,247
You will come to my camp.

23
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:35,997
Stop crying!

24
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:43,338
I am but newly wed.
Why must I be stolen away?

25
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:50,506
My husband will come
to take me back.

26
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,442
There will be war.

27
00:03:55,351 --> 00:04:00,311
I welcome it. I'm always ready
to scatter the Merkit.

28
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:05,316
But tell me... what is your name?

29
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:12,199
I am Hoelun, wife to Yege Chiled
of the Merkit.

30
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:14,934
'Hoelun'...

31
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:18,029
Now you are my wife.

32
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,477
I'll treat you well.

33
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,317
One day I would take revenge.

34
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,511
I swore that in my heart.

35
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:44,893
Nine months had passed
since Yesukhei had taken me.

36
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:49,136
The baby's coming! Stop!

37
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,405
You'll be fine.

38
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,072
It won't be long now.

39
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:01,843
That's right...

40
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:05,215
That's right...

41
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:26,039
In this land of the Mongols,
the tribes were always at war.

42
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,108
Men defeated in battle were killed...

43
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:32,946
and the women seized as spoils.

44
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:40,550
Chief!

45
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,054
Chief!

46
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,794
He's the leader.

47
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:57,297
He killed many of u s.

48
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,599
A brave enemy.

49
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,035
What's your name?

50
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,779
Temujin.

51
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,648
Temujin Uge.

52
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:12,647
'Temujin'... I won't forget that name.

53
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:23,826
Chief!

54
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,565
The baby's born!

55
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,565
It's a boy!

56
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:33,166
It is? A boy?

57
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,078
'Temujin'?

58
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,741
That will be his name?

59
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:42,975
Yes.

60
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,520
It's a good name.

61
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,984
The name of a brave enemy
I killed.

62
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,789
That Tatar chief?

63
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,324
Yes.

64
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:57,298
'Temujin'...

65
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,167
Temujin, son of Yesukhei Baghatur.

66
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:07,934
Temujin was named for
an enemy chief his father had slain.

67
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:13,947
He was born to a blood-drenched
destiny of slaughter.

68
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:17,347
Rest well.

69
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,243
What fate is yours?!

70
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:08,365
When he was 14, Temujin went
with his father in search of a bride.

71
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:14,770
In those years
I had borne four more children.

72
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:19,438
I had also raised two more
born of a different mother.

73
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:27,951
My first husband, who had sworn
to take me back, never appeared.

74
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:32,219
Suddenly, many years
had gone by.

75
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,364
Father, look how far Mt Burhan is.

76
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,371
Tomorrow it will be out of sight.

77
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,472
Nevertheless...

78
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:55,241
its spirit will watch over us.

79
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:02,587
The first Mongol was born there.
His destiny given by the gods.

80
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,818
The Blue Wolf.

81
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,722
'The Blue Wolf'?

82
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:07,556
Yes.

83
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:14,125
He crossed the great lake,
and made the White Deer his wife.

84
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:17,237
Batachikan was their child.

85
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:23,167
Through generations
his blood is ours.

86
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:25,774
Temujin...

87
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,180
yours, too.

88
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:32,848
His blood flows in me, too?

89
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:01,309
A drink called 'wine',
from beyond the Uyghur lands.

90
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,382
Do you like it?

91
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:06,043
Many are the rarities of a land
that prospers on trade.

92
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:10,454
And where are you bound?

93
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,789
I am in search of a wife
for my son.

94
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:19,158
We will look among his mother's kin,
the Olkhunut.

95
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,406
My daughter Borte.

96
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,755
I dreamed last night.

97
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:41,248
You did?

98
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:47,161
A white hawk struck the sun and moon.
Then perched on my arm.

99
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:54,035
I'd just finished telling Borte
a White hawk was a good omen.

100
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,497
Had I not?

101
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,136
Father!

102
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:01,175
That's the third time
you've said that today!

103
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,907
But now I understand.

104
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:10,280
The white hawk announced
you would visit with your son.

105
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,286
It's so quiet...

106
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,783
It seems there's no war here.

107
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,957
Have you been in battle?

108
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,630
Not yet.

109
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:30,070
But I want to, soon, and avenge
the wrongs done to my tribe.

110
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:31,534
Borte!

111
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,644
Hello.

112
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:44,778
Who's he?

113
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,988
My affianced.

114
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:48,453
He is?

115
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:53,893
I am Jamuqa of the Jadirat,
childhood friend to Borte.

116
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:57,894
I am Temujin of the Mongols.
I'll be here for a while.

117
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:58,931
I greet you.

118
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:02,732
Shall we compete with the bow?

119
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:04,170
The bow?

120
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,424
What skill!

121
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:27,585
None of us can shoot like that.

122
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:32,866
My ancestors are Mongol. Too.
Let us vow friendship.

123
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,028
A vow?

124
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,262
All right.

125
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:44,202
As of today we are friends
bound closer than brothers.

126
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,887
I will never betray you.

127
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,715
I will treasure your friendship.

128
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:59,056
While I have life,
there is friendship between us.

129
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,555
I so swear!

130
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:08,059
I want to make the Mongols
into one nation.

131
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,529
'Nation'?

132
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,161
What's that?

133
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,175
All the tribes united in one.

134
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:18,139
Can that be done?

135
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,181
Look.

136
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:31,153
The land of Jin.
One khan rules it all.

137
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,386
One?

138
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,994
But they're enemies.

139
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,264
Think about it. Temujin.

140
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:46,999
We've always been nomads,
at war with each other.

141
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,742
If we keep doing that,
the Mongols will be destroyed.

142
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:56,107
Someone has to unite us
into a rich land of peace.

143
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,450
I see...

144
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:02,047
You think about things like that...

145
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,284
Temujin!

146
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:17,305
Munrik! Didn't you go home
with my father?

147
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,368
Temujin...

148
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:28,044
I'm sorry. The Tatars
have poisoned your father.

149
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:30,148
Poisoned?

150
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,309
How is he?

151
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:36,980
He's dead!

152
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:39,961
My father...

153
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:44,657
Murdered?!

154
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:57,345
Temujin arrived back
five days after the funeral.

155
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:02,543
Talgutei of the Tayichi'ut
had announced himself...

156
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:05,017
Yesukhei's successor.

157
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:09,121
He was taking the clan
and leaving.

158
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,157
Nothing keeps us here!

159
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:19,601
Follow the Onon River
to new pastures!

160
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:27,304
Go, and do not stop your horses!

161
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,789
What's going on?!

162
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,221
Why?

163
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,133
Why?

164
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:57,205
Why are you leaving?

165
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,538
Where are you going?

166
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,466
What's happened?

167
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,536
Why are you going?!

168
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,413
We mustn't leave here!

169
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:14,219
Hurry!

170
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,820
He's a traitor!

171
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,394
Go back!

172
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:22,525
Temujin!

173
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:24,662
Withdraw!

174
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,133
Talgutei! You betray
my father Yesukhei!

175
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,261
Silence, boy!

176
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:34,102
You are no Mongol.
In your blood is the filth of Merkit.

177
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:38,074
Are you mad?
I am son to Yesukhei Baghatur!

178
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,611
None recognizes you as heir.

179
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,847
Your mother lay with a Merkit.

180
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:49,253
Who would follow one born
of such a woman?

181
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,049
Temujin!

182
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,024
Temujin, no!

183
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:56,796
Talgutei!

184
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:02,432
Neither I nor the clan of Yesukhei
will forget this treachery!

185
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:05,103
Nor I your Merkit blood!

186
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,288
Left behind by the tribe...

187
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:28,088
we had to forage for our food.

188
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:57,023
Hey!

189
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,452
What are you doing?!

190
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:04,359
We divide the game with the rest.
That's the rule!

191
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,697
I don't take orders from a Merkit!

192
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:11,272
What?!

193
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,666
Temujin...

194
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:17,006
your mother was pregnant by a Merkit
when she was taken.

195
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:18,606
The child was you!

196
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,513
Belgutei! Your sword!

197
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,211
Draw!

198
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:30,853
Come at me!

199
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,622
Well?

200
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:37,327
Scared?

201
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:49,074
See? You are Merkit scum!

202
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:07,591
Bekhter!

203
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,166
No, Temujin!

204
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:15,765
Please!

205
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:21,405
Bekhter, while you're here,
we will not be united.

206
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:25,939
The family will fall apart,
and we won't survive.

207
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,978
So I will kill you.

208
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:30,846
Bekhter!

209
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,711
Run! They'll kill you!

210
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:34,553
Not him.

211
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,455
Just you.

212
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,367
You two...

213
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:58,609
what have you done?!

214
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,482
Temujin!

215
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,454
Qasar!

216
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:24,302
A brother who shared your blood...

217
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:29,842
one of your few allies...

218
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,306
you've killed him!

219
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:39,944
Perhaps he would drive us apart...

220
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,022
but still!

221
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,856
It wasn't only that.

222
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,159
He...

223
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,497
insulted you.

224
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:57,170
Insulted me?

225
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,941
So I killed him.

226
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,980
He showed no mercy...

227
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:21,452
to one who disobeyed,
or one who betrayed.

228
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:23,495
That...

229
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:27,124
never changed in all his life.

230
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:42,606
These walls won't hold long
if the Tayichi'ut attack.

231
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:47,814
I know. They're to buy time for
the women and children to get clear.

232
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:52,859
None of the Borjigin like
how Talgutei runs things.

233
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,862
They'll all come back.
Just like I did.

234
00:21:56,331 --> 00:22:01,200
Munrik, I'm grateful you brought
your people with you.

235
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:02,769
We've been robbed!

236
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,230
Horse thieves!

237
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:07,106
Horse thieves?!

238
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:09,605
How many?

239
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:11,539
How many head?

240
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,547
Eight. While I wasn't looking.

241
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,708
They can't have gone far.

242
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,412
It wasn't just one man. I'll go.

243
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:22,250
Brother! I'll go instead.

244
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:25,189
We can't fight without horses.

245
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:27,420
I'll get them back.

246
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,286
Steal my horses, will you?

247
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:39,333
Horse thief!

248
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,936
Wait! It's not how you think!

249
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,435
Then how is it?

250
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,632
The thieves passed here this morning.

251
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:51,007
I've had horses stolen before,
so I went out to scare them away.

252
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:54,138
They took off and left those horses.

253
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:55,507
They're yours...

254
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,982
Yes. I'll have them back.

255
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:02,021
Take them!
Just lower your bow, p lease.

256
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:07,318
Are you Temujin?

257
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:10,487
How did you know?

258
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:12,463
Word gets around.

259
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:18,136
The Tayichi'ut betrayed you,
and you don't have many men.

260
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,867
We're few in number,
but we fear no one.

261
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:27,238
Good. There are still ways to fight
when you are few.

262
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:29,306
Take your horses.

263
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:36,088
I will thank you in good time.

264
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,725
Now I need every horse I have.

265
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,728
I'll wait. There are many ways
to show gratitude.

266
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:47,900
I'll look forward to it.
I am Bo'orchu.

267
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:51,528
'Bo'orchu'? I won't forget.

268
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:00,906
The next year,
to collect his bride...

269
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,918
Temujin went after seven years
to Dei Seichun of the Onggirat.

270
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,088
Temujin!

271
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:17,421
You're alive!

272
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,096
I heard you had been killed
by the Tayichi'ut.

273
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:27,766
For seven years
we heard nothing.

274
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:35,112
Borte was passing marriage age.
I arranged for another groom.

275
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:38,886
I'm sorry.

276
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:42,781
My father was killed,
my clan scattered...

277
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:44,749
I never forgot her.

278
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,427
And now you've come...

279
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:53,460
Who will she marry?

280
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,800
Jamuqa. He asked for her.

281
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,307
Jamuqa?

282
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:08,439
I see...

283
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,351
Jamuqa...

284
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,262
Temujin!

285
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,938
I came when I heard you were here.

286
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:36,873
Jamuqa!

287
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:39,810
It's been years!

288
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,351
Congratulations.

289
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,844
You've seen Borte?

290
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:50,524
No. I'm leaving now.

291
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,325
Make her happy.

292
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:59,032
Temujin, I don't want this
to end our friendship.

293
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:04,162
Let's have Borte decide
which of us she wants.

294
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:09,201
Borte...

295
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:14,308
which of us do you choose?
We leave it to you.

296
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:15,480
Speak.

297
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:22,720
Well, Borte?

298
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:25,492
Temujin, or me?

299
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:51,346
Borte, are you sure?

300
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,254
Are you really sure?

301
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:03,526
You chose me!

302
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,934
You're beautiful.

303
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:19,103
Temujin, I've betrayed you
in my heart.

304
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:21,775
You have?

305
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:27,317
It's true my father wished it...
but I decided...

306
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:30,419
I'd be Jamuqa's wife.

307
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:37,888
I betrayed the one who said
he would come for me.

308
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:46,463
Borte, I am the one at fault.

309
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:51,778
With my father dead...
betrayed by the Tayichi'ut...

310
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,742
thinking only of keeping
my family and clan alive...

311
00:28:57,285 --> 00:29:02,086
I left you without word of me
for seven years.

312
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:07,820
You didn't know
if I was alive or dead.

313
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:09,962
Who can blame you?

314
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,460
Borte...

315
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:15,662
forgive me.

316
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:17,863
You must forgive me.

317
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:22,766
I should not have lost faith
in you.

318
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:30,840
But Temujin,
you have betrayed me as well.

319
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:35,685
I have?

320
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:36,882
Yes.

321
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:42,319
Why were you leaving without seeing me?

322
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:50,803
Because you were to be married
to Jamuqa, my sworn friend.

323
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:54,038
He would have made you happy.

324
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:59,542
Why did you not raise your voice
and cry out, 'Borte is my wife!'

325
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:04,682
'This must not be!'

326
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:13,216
This is the same
lack of faith as mine.

327
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:16,497
The same betrayal.

328
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,657
It pained me.

329
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:27,834
Borte...

330
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,411
I'll make up for it.

331
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:39,118
On my life,
I will make up for my betrayal.

332
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,685
You won't be hurt again.

333
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:48,759
I promise.

334
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,248
Mother...

335
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:18,623
this is Borte.

336
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:22,455
I greet you. Mother.

337
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:26,728
You've come far.

338
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:30,236
My younger brothers...

339
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:34,136
and sister Temulen.

340
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,644
Hello, Temulen.

341
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,307
Come this way.

342
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:45,918
You help with her luggage.

343
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:48,917
Temujin!

344
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:52,249
Well! Bo'orchu!

345
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:55,322
You've brought a pretty wife!

346
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:56,657
Welcome!

347
00:31:57,198 --> 00:32:00,429
I came while you were gone.
To collect my reward.

348
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:02,832
What would you like?

349
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:08,805
Let me join you. I want to be more
than chief of a small clan.

350
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,173
Is that all?

351
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,641
I grant it gladly.

352
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:18,343
I want someone who sees things
differently from me.

353
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,887
You'll be perfect.

354
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:24,820
This is where you will live.

355
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,129
It has all the household things.
I hope you'll like it.

356
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,201
It will be fine, Mother.

357
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:36,564
Borte...

358
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:42,699
will one who has lacked for nothing
be able to stand poverty like ours?

359
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:45,713
Not just poverty.

360
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:50,373
Constant threat of attack,
I'm also told.

361
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:56,322
But beside the pain of being apart
for seven years...

362
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:58,219
that is nothing.

363
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:01,994
Thank you.

364
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:10,165
While there are more of us
than there were...

365
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:13,171
and life is better...

366
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:17,239
the Tayichi'ut, the Tatars,
or the Merkit...

367
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:21,041
would overwhelm us
with a real attack...

368
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:24,413
He will protect us.

369
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:31,757
I will never suffer again.
He promised me that.

370
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:37,127
My heart is at ease.

371
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:52,637
Two years later, seeking ties
with Toghrul, Khan of the Kerait...

372
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:57,713
Temujin set off bearing tribute.

373
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:09,587
You are Temujin?

374
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,332
I have heard your name.

375
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:18,797
It is an honor to meet you.

376
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:24,806
And what brings you here today?

377
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,479
When my father Yesukhei died.
He said in his will...

378
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:41,184
that I should seek the aid
of Toghrul Khan.

379
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:50,102
Yesukhei Baghatur
was my sworn friend.

380
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:56,274
Today, honoring my pledge
to my father...

381
00:34:57,812 --> 00:35:02,010
I bring a treasure of my house,
a robe of black sable...

382
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:08,346
and present it to you
in his name.

383
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:17,555
A robe...

384
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,331
of black sable?

385
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:24,701
Well!

386
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,570
A gift indeed!

387
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:34,911
How do you come to have
such a thing as this?

388
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:41,918
My wife brought it as dowry.

389
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:46,255
I see...

390
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:48,888
Temujin!

391
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,028
Sire!

392
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:53,497
Support me, and be loyal.

393
00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:01,001
And for my part.
I will keep you safe.

394
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:10,549
And then. That fall...

395
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,377
Grant us...

396
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,589
the blessings...

397
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,192
of nature.

398
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:03,093
What's that noise?

399
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:05,262
Temujin! Wake up!

400
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,139
Everyone!

401
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,014
I hear horses!

402
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:18,643
Listen...

403
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,953
take Mother and hide in the woods.

404
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,283
Husband!

405
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:29,753
Just stay calm
and do what we've planned.

406
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,621
The enemy!

407
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:34,296
To arms!

408
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:36,293
The Tayichi'ut!

409
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:38,029
It's the Tayichi'ut!

410
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:41,140
Don't panic!
They're still a distance away!

411
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:44,037
Stay calm and get ready to leave!

412
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:45,337
Tolui!

413
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,644
How many?

414
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:48,006
Five or six hundred.

415
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,216
Chief!

416
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,815
They're Tayichi'ut!

417
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:51,816
Brother!

418
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:54,183
Five or six hundred of them.

419
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:57,955
We proceed as planned.

420
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:02,126
We're only 50.
We can't meet them head-on.

421
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,358
Delay them with small groups.

422
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:07,859
Munrik...

423
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:11,130
Have the women ride into the hills.

424
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:15,332
Carts for those who can't ride.
No baggage.

425
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,019
The enemy!

426
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:29,520
They're coming!

427
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,697
Borte?

428
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:44,868
Where's Borte?

429
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:46,030
I'll call her.

430
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:47,936
Ma'am!

431
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,233
You must leave!

432
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:51,778
We cannot retreat with you here.

433
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:53,836
Borte's not here.

434
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:56,506
I'll send her on another cart.

435
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,379
Take them away.

436
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,579
Chief! They're not Tayichi'ut.

437
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:33,453
They're Merkit!

438
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:39,650
Retreat!

439
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:41,255
Retreat!

440
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:59,573
Burn everything!

441
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:01,574
Wreck it all!

442
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:12,420
Mother!

443
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:20,260
The attackers were Merkit.

444
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:22,467
Merkit?

445
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:26,634
They came from
the wrong direction.

446
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:29,334
And the bows are different.

447
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:36,475
So he came...

448
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,218
Mother!

449
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:40,613
Mother!

450
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,016
Temujin!

451
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:46,887
You're safe?

452
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:49,020
Good.

453
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:54,499
Is everyone all right?

454
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:04,669
We did not lose a man!

455
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:09,507
Against a force ten times ours.
That is a miracle.

456
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,010
Rejoice!

457
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:16,184
Temujin!

458
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,656
Isn't Borte with you?

459
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:21,761
Borte?

460
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:23,426
She's not here?

461
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:30,735
Coaquchin said
she was already gone.

462
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,401
She's not here...

463
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:40,108
I see...

464
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:43,276
That's what they wanted.

465
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:45,676
I'll go find her!

466
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,852
No! Stop!

467
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:50,047
Stand back!

468
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:52,216
You'll get killed!

469
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:53,418
Move!

470
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,220
Brother!

471
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:57,194
Without our Chief, we are lost!

472
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:00,761
Move!

473
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:02,897
Chief!

474
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:05,904
Temujin!

475
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:07,431
Temujin!

476
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:18,583
So it's true...

477
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:26,224
that Father took you
from the Merkit?

478
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:34,928
So after 20 years...

479
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,831
this is their revenge?

480
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:56,788
Since I was small,
I've been told I was of Merkit seed.

481
00:42:58,525 --> 00:43:00,789
But I didn't believe it.

482
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:06,460
Mother, I want you to tell me.

483
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:10,636
Am I of Merkit blood? Or...

484
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:11,863
Enough!

485
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:13,664
You shame Mother!

486
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:21,046
Tell me.

487
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:28,480
Am I not Father's child?

488
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,653
No more!

489
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:35,862
Why raise this now?

490
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:42,863
Elder Brother though you are...
you will not speak of it again!

491
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:47,038
Temujin...

492
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:58,343
it is you who must prove
you are son to Yesukhei Baghatur.

493
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:01,852
Not me.

494
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:10,662
Your father never once
spoke to me of doubt...

495
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:13,425
about your birth.

496
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:20,035
He believed that one day
you would prove...

497
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:23,602
yours was the blood of the Blue Wolf.

498
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:46,260
Mother...

499
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:50,269
Qasar...

500
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,403
this tragedy must not be repeated.

501
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:00,979
Join with Temujin...

502
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:05,318
and bring Borte back
as soon as you can.

503
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:16,794
Father...

504
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,630
tell me.

505
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:24,494
What am I?

506
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,171
Does your blood not flow in me?

507
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:53,192
With no way to strike back,
six months went by.

508
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:06,372
Borte is my wife.

509
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:10,149
I will take her back.

510
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:16,980
I understand how you feel...
but we are 300 to their 3,000.

511
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,816
We cannot win.

512
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:23,327
Seek help from Toghrul.

513
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:28,935
Brother, send a messenger
to Jamuqa as well.

514
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:33,233
Chief, you cannot leave her there
for too long.

515
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:38,104
After a year. Or two,
if she bears Merkit children...

516
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:40,338
she cannot return.

517
00:46:41,014 --> 00:46:44,814
We must decide now, Chief.

518
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:48,152
Go to Toghrul and Jamuqa.

519
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,988
Thank you.

520
00:46:58,098 --> 00:46:59,497
I am pleased.

521
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:06,239
I will take command.
Is that agreed?

522
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,998
Yes.

523
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:14,910
We should attack by night,
with you on the right flank, Sire.

524
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:17,510
Of course.

525
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,580
We will attack from the hills behind.

526
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:25,390
Temujin, you take the front.

527
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:30,963
Sire...

528
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:35,593
will you lend me 500 of your men?

529
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:40,772
300 is not enough
for a frontal attack.

530
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,608
Fine.

531
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:45,271
Take my best men.

532
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:50,578
In return, I will take
seven parts of the spoils...

533
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:52,742
Jamuqa two...

534
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,121
and you will content yourself
with one.

535
00:47:57,758 --> 00:48:01,421
Only two parts? I withdraw!

536
00:48:01,562 --> 00:48:02,824
Wait!

537
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,327
I need nothing.

538
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,836
It is only with your help
I can strike at the Merkit.

539
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:18,105
I beg your indulgence.

540
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:02,684
Charge!

541
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,157
Where is Borte?!

542
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:16,625
Borte!

543
00:49:27,447 --> 00:49:28,379
Forward!

544
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:46,394
Borte!

545
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:51,563
Temujin!

546
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:54,599
We know which way she's gone!

547
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,757
Borte!

548
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:16,351
Borte!

549
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:17,895
It's Temujin!

550
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:19,492
How many men?

551
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,032
About ten!

552
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,863
Leave her! Withdraw!

553
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:25,695
Borte!

554
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:30,368
Borte!

555
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:39,547
After them!

556
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:00,833
Borte?

557
00:51:02,509 --> 00:51:03,840
Is that you?

558
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:12,483
What's wrong?

559
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:20,154
Have you forgotten me?
I'm your husband.

560
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:33,667
Husband...

561
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:39,276
I've missed you.

562
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,481
Husband...

563
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:09,397
Bring her.

564
00:53:13,373 --> 00:53:15,398
Cart and all!

565
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:41,826
Temujin...

566
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,437
this happens to Mongol women.

567
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:49,940
Let it pass.

568
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,578
We've got him!

569
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:20,467
On your feet!

570
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:27,475
This is Chiled! He took Lady Borte.

571
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:33,147
Yesukhei Baghatur
took Hoelun from me!

572
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:37,818
This was my revenge!

573
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:47,125
You?

574
00:55:34,647 --> 00:55:37,115
Damn you!

575
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:03,804
He's dead!

576
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:06,869
He's dead.

577
00:56:17,157 --> 00:56:21,457
The victory celebration
went on for three days and nights.

578
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:34,003
Look at you!

579
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:39,008
We're all here, and still alive!

580
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,375
Chief! Sit with us and drink!

581
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:46,815
I will.

582
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:49,353
Bo'orchu!

583
00:56:50,023 --> 00:56:53,925
To your courage
and quick thinking in battle.

584
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,426
Blessings on you!

585
00:56:58,398 --> 00:57:02,027
Belgutei.
To your skill with the sword.

586
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:06,971
Qasar,
there is no archer like you.

587
00:57:07,107 --> 00:57:11,134
Blessings on you!

588
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:14,205
Munrik!

589
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:19,784
Guardian of my house!
For your generosity and wisdom...

590
00:57:19,919 --> 00:57:21,511
blessings on you!

591
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:28,059
Jelme!

592
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:32,921
For your arrowheads and spears
that fell our enemies...

593
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:35,057
I thank Tengri.

594
00:57:35,235 --> 00:57:38,227
Blessings on you!

595
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,801
A son is born!

596
00:58:03,963 --> 00:58:07,592
He's sure to kill this child.

597
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:11,596
I won't let him.

598
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:13,430
It's me.

599
00:58:24,317 --> 00:58:27,844
Borte, give me the child.

600
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,115
To do what?

601
00:58:33,126 --> 00:58:36,425
Will you embrace this child?

602
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:38,030
Don't be a fool!

603
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:41,365
A Merkit child? I'll kill it.

604
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:46,866
What makes you so sure
it's a Merkit child?

605
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,235
Anyway, it's a girl.

606
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:55,144
Will you kill even a girl?

607
00:58:56,216 --> 00:58:57,308
A girl?

608
00:58:59,252 --> 00:59:00,913
I heard it was a boy.

609
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:04,819
Is this true?

610
00:59:09,596 --> 00:59:11,325
Then I will spare her.

611
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:15,828
But I never want to set eyes on her.

612
00:59:17,337 --> 00:59:18,497
But if...

613
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,966
it were a boy?

614
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,143
'If'?

615
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,283
So it is a boy...

616
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:35,854
Then it dies.

617
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:37,850
Give it to me.

618
00:59:38,024 --> 00:59:42,324
A child is a blessing from Tengri.
You must not kill it.

619
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:49,163
I'm not killing a child.
I'm killing a Merkit.

620
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:54,533
Temujin, a newborn child
has not sinned.

621
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:00,768
Do you lack the generosity
to raise it as your own?

622
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:04,876
Your father was not that way.

623
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:13,018
If he had killed you
as a Merkit child...

624
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,286
you would not be here.

625
01:00:18,564 --> 01:00:24,503
It is women who suffer most
from this cycle of rape and revenge.

626
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:33,001
Would you also then
take away Borte's child, Temujin?

627
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:45,382
I do not blame Borte.

628
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,424
I let her be taken.

629
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:55,692
While I lead this tribe...

630
01:00:57,203 --> 01:01:01,606
no woman will be taken as spoils
ever again.

631
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:05,504
Then accept the child.

632
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:07,544
Give him a name.

633
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,615
Husband. Please.

634
01:01:11,351 --> 01:01:14,445
Give this child a name.

635
01:01:38,378 --> 01:01:39,140
'Jochi'.

636
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:43,613
Yes.

637
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:50,212
His name will be 'Jochi'.

638
01:01:58,598 --> 01:01:59,963
'Jochi'?

639
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:03,232
'Outsider'.

640
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:08,663
Born an outsider...

641
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:12,571
The poor child!

642
01:02:14,213 --> 01:02:20,015
I don't care what he's called.
At least now he will live.

643
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:22,343
Isn't that so...

644
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:24,351
Jochi?

645
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:35,325
War leaves great scars
on the defeated.

646
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:41,373
And the victorious tribe
grows ever stronger.

647
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:46,341
The name 'Temujin the Mighty'
spread far and wide...

648
01:02:46,479 --> 01:02:51,678
and every year more clans
flocked to him.

649
01:02:53,786 --> 01:02:59,190
Toghrul Khan, I am honored
you have come so far.

650
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,050
A fine camp!

651
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:06,990
Temujin, you have come far.

652
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:16,404
A messenger has come from
the court of Jin.

653
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:19,976
They are delayed in
their conquest of the Tatars.

654
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:23,081
They ask my help.

655
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:27,378
Temujin, will you
strike at the Tatars with me?

656
01:03:27,987 --> 01:03:32,253
The name 'Jin' alone
makes me tremble with rage.

657
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:39,554
But Temujin,
the Tatars are the enemy...

658
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:43,100
who poisoned your father.

659
01:03:43,769 --> 01:03:49,537
Close your eyes to Jin
and join me against the Tatars.

660
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:53,576
And by vanquishing the Tatars...

661
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:56,113
great treasure will be ours!

662
01:03:57,016 --> 01:03:58,449
Toghrul Khan...

663
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,345
why do you ask me...

664
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:06,448
and not Jamuqa?

665
01:04:10,963 --> 01:04:15,297
Because of your spirit.

666
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:20,936
Temujin, I will pay well
for your strength.

667
01:04:23,843 --> 01:04:25,470
Now...

668
01:04:26,712 --> 01:04:29,146
the time has come to smite...

669
01:04:29,715 --> 01:04:31,979
our eternal enemies, the Tatars!

670
01:04:34,253 --> 01:04:38,656
They betrayed our second Khan
to Jin...

671
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:41,819
killed our third...

672
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:45,595
and poisoned our fourth,
my father.

673
01:04:48,334 --> 01:04:54,273
While the Tatars remain.
Our forefathers will not sleep.

674
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:59,009
Are you with me?!

675
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:02,344
Let us unite...

676
01:05:03,249 --> 01:05:08,346
annihilate the Tatars
and put our ancestors to rest!

677
01:05:17,363 --> 01:05:21,424
The strategy used
put the army of Jin at the front...

678
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:27,995
while Temujin and Toghrul
attacked the Tatars from behind.

679
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:31,876
After ten days of fighting...

680
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:35,536
the Tatars were all but destroyed.

681
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:43,283
Chief... the Khan returns.

682
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:57,159
Well! Temujin!

683
01:05:59,572 --> 01:06:02,666
We're celebrating with some hunting.

684
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:04,535
I am glad to hear it.

685
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:08,672
I will take my army
and return home...

686
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:11,749
dealing with Tatar stragglers
along the way.

687
01:06:12,151 --> 01:06:13,482
Oh?

688
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:15,318
You're leaving?

689
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:17,585
Come with me.

690
01:06:22,428 --> 01:06:23,759
Temujin...

691
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:28,432
In this war I have seen
how powerful you are.

692
01:06:30,636 --> 01:06:35,039
Right now you could
defeat Jamuqa with ease.

693
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:36,639
Jamuqa?

694
01:06:36,776 --> 01:06:41,110
Temujin, crush Jamuqa now.

695
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,578
Or one day he will attack you.

696
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:45,849
Never!

697
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:50,948
We are friends pledged to a vow.

698
01:06:51,223 --> 01:06:53,623
What vow?

699
01:06:54,994 --> 01:06:57,428
To unite the Mongols.

700
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:01,629
That is our dream.

701
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:07,768
Jamuqa is not dreaming
that dream.

702
01:07:08,307 --> 01:07:13,540
All he is capable of
is wishing himself the greatest.

703
01:07:14,246 --> 01:07:17,841
In any event,
you and Jamuqa...

704
01:07:17,983 --> 01:07:20,543
cannot go forward together.

705
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:28,983
I am also in his debt
for my wife, Borte.

706
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:32,631
I cannot fight my sworn friend.

707
01:07:32,832 --> 01:07:34,163
Excuse me.

708
01:07:37,169 --> 01:07:37,999
Brother!

709
01:07:38,838 --> 01:07:41,500
Yes, Teichal?

710
01:07:41,841 --> 01:07:43,274
I'm just leaving.

711
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:45,502
A word first.

712
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:48,171
What is it?

713
01:07:48,547 --> 01:07:51,744
I'm surprised you're so calm.

714
01:07:51,884 --> 01:07:54,853
Calm? About what?

715
01:07:55,521 --> 01:07:59,685
Temujin has joined with Toghrul,
and left you out.

716
01:08:01,093 --> 01:08:07,191
Let him die fighting who he wishes.
The Mongols do not need two khans.

717
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:08,693
Exactly.

718
01:08:09,435 --> 01:08:14,031
He wishes to leave you aside...
and rule himself.

719
01:08:15,107 --> 01:08:16,665
Impossible!

720
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:22,046
He is a man who goes to war
over one lone woman.

721
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:27,180
Women are for pleasure...
or for bearing children.

722
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:29,217
There's always another.

723
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:33,387
A king cannot have feelings.

724
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:36,221
Temujin loves Borte.

725
01:08:36,896 --> 01:08:41,492
Your vow of friendship
trips you up as well.

726
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:47,900
That vow did not come from trust.
It came from fear of betrayal.

727
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:52,207
It was a child's game.

728
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:03,746
Chief! There are riders ahead.

729
01:09:03,923 --> 01:09:04,855
Tatars?

730
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,651
Merkit stragglers. I think.

731
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:10,057
Whoever they are, crush them!

732
01:10:31,443 --> 01:10:32,432
Wait!

733
01:10:56,402 --> 01:10:57,767
A woman?

734
01:10:59,038 --> 01:11:00,266
Name?

735
01:11:00,606 --> 01:11:01,698
State your name!

736
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:05,934
Kill me.

737
01:11:07,413 --> 01:11:09,108
I don't kill women.

738
01:11:09,782 --> 01:11:11,010
I have lost.

739
01:11:18,424 --> 01:11:22,383
Kill me. I am a soldier.

740
01:11:25,998 --> 01:11:28,558
Enough. Take off that armor
and relax.

741
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:30,031
Don't touch me!

742
01:11:31,737 --> 01:11:33,705
You will not have me.

743
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:37,809
Men are all the same.

744
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:42,136
They violate women,
and make them bear children.

745
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:50,079
My father and brother are dead.
I am head of my house.

746
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:55,083
I will suffer woman's grief no more.

747
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:57,427
I see...

748
01:11:59,164 --> 01:12:00,756
What can you do?

749
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:03,734
Fight in battle.
