A production of

12
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,504
Too bad, Mauricio.
Again you had to lose, brother.

13
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,877
- Right?
- Yes.

14
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,023
- Stop, Nacho.
- Let go!

15
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,529
- Calm down!
- Let go!

16
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:18,689
Now!

17
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:20,528
This one is a poor loser.

18
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,692
You're right.

19
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,360
This guy is a loser!

20
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:26,200
You know what?
Hand over the dough. Move it!

21
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:27,261
Give it to him!

22
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:32,869
Nice toy you have.

23
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,214
Look, Charly.
He pays for our beer again.

24
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,549
- How nice of you, man!
- Let's go to the bar.

25
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:42,610
Cheers.

26
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,392
Give up, Mauricio.
You are a loser--a poor loser.

27
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,555
Shut up, you idiot!

28
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,566
You know damn well
l can't stand that bastard.

29
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,898
As a matter of fact,
l just thought of something.

30
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:00,565
We're going to look for them
at the bar.

31
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,073
So pick everything up.

32
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,083
lsn't it true, my Charly?

33
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:15,587
Alejandra doesn't
want to believe me.

34
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:18,954
Well, there was a moment
when l was behind some pipes

35
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,585
and Mauricio walked by real, real close.

36
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:22,923
l don't know how he didn't see me.

37
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,191
- Oh, yeah, sure!
- l'm serious.

38
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:27,096
Please tell her, Charly.
She doesn't believe me, brother.

39
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,727
lt's true, it's true Alejandra.

40
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,634
Mauricio never saw him.

41
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:36,404
And l don't know how,
but in the end, Nacho shot him twice.

42
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,103
No, no, wait a minute!
They weren't two shots.

43
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,770
They were two ink pills.

44
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,576
And by the way, those toys
are kind of fun. Right, Charly?

45
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,284
Okay, okay, l do believe you.

46
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,286
And l love the fact
that you beat Mauricio.

47
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,948
But what l don't like is that
you are always fighting with him.

48
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,118
Oh, Alejandra, are you going
to start with that again?

49
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,890
Don't make such an issue, will you?

50
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:00,126
All right, but keep in mind
that you don't make me happy.

51
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,191
Hey, you know that Mauricio is a clown.

52
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:07,105
Watch it, watch it.
Look who's coming in.

53
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,320
Oh, dear God,
why do you do this to me?

54
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,982
Show up with this asshole.

55
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,992
Oh, no, Nacho!
Are you all going to start again?

56
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:36,161
l want them to come to my table,
so go and tell them exactly what l told you.

57
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:53,018
What you did today
was real good, Nacho.

58
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,020
There's no question about it.
You were better than Mauricio.

59
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,521
And he already accepted it.

60
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,184
Except that this time
we have something new to offer you.

61
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,923
Stop the nonsense!
What's behind this?

62
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,022
Let Mauricio tell you.

63
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,500
Except this time, it's not a game.

64
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,708
Nacho!

65
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,266
Don't you want to see this?

66
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,715
Oh, Mauricio! Mauricio!

67
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,560
What are you planning now?

68
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,594
Since you like to compete so much,

69
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,362
l thought of something more interesting.

70
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,528
Something that
you might be interested in.

71
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,040
''Massacre.

72
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,908
''Three hunters dead
and two missing at Filo de Caballo.

73
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,246
They're sure it was a bear.''

74
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:00,782
So what's with this?

75
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,948
Oh, Mauricio, that's enough!
Stop wasting your time.

76
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,514
These guys will never accept your bet.

77
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,423
What's it about?

78
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:12,931
Look, Alejandra,
this is what it's about.

79
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,968
Whoever kills the bear
will be the winner.

80
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't fall for his game, Nacho.

81
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,435
All of this is stupid.

82
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:22,496
Hey, hey, hey!

83
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:25,703
Since when
do you decide for him, Alejandra?

84
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,439
What? Doesn't he wear the pants?

85
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,620
What's your plan?
What's the bet?

86
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,956
This time there will be no bet.

87
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,963
lt's about showing the town
who's best!

88
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,465
Besides, you owe me a rematch.

89
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,811
Do it, Nacho!

90
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,974
You know they will not beat us.

91
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,952
Listen carefully to what
l am going to say, Mauricio.

92
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,285
l will give you the rematch,

93
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:14,155
but this will be the last time
l make a bet with you.

94
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:15,819
Did you understand me?

95
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,297
The newspaper says that the bear
is around Filo de Caballo,

96
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:29,534
and that place is about
five hours away from here.

97
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:35,104
So Charly and l recommend
that you all go to bed early.

98
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,815
Look, you don't need to worry about us.

99
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:44,049
lt's not the first time
that we've gone hunting.

100
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,851
Keep this. lt's yours to read.

101
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,366
Don't worry.

102
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,202
We'll make them look ridiculous.

103
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,332
You'll see.

104
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,893
Look, l'm sorry, Alejandra.

105
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,726
l couldn't get out of this one.
Please understand me, will you?

106
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,561
Yes. l know, Nacho.

107
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:35,904
l just hope that this is really
the last time you wager with him.

108
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,067
l promise!

109
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:38,576
No, no, no, no!

110
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:40,908
Don't think this is going to be free.

111
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,743
There's just one condition.

112
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,908
Whatever you want!
Which one?

113
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,246
That this time...

114
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,582
l am going with you.

115
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:50,644
Hey, but...

116
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,588
l'm going to the car for some things.

117
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,763
- Listen, how...
- l'm going to the office for some things.

118
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,993
And now
what is Mauricio doing here?

119
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:07,658
Well, who knows?
But it smells like food.

120
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:11,829
Quesadillas, beans with epazote...

121
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,496
Good nose!

122
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:17,669
You can't think of anything else.
That is why you have such a big belly!

123
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,335
Big belly!

124
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,504
You wish!

125
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,175
Contrary to the dog feast
with your sack of bones!

126
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,025
Just wait and see.

127
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,366
Oh! You're the one who has to watch out
if you keep messing with me.

128
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,874
What a strange place. l can't understand
what Mauricio is doing here.

129
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,713
lt looks as if something
was for sale, right?

130
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:00,774
Quesadillas.

131
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,551
Well, l am only interested in 30-06.

132
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:11,392
But you want to take advantage
of me, Mr. Jeremias.

133
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:14,900
All right.
Thirty thousand for all of them.

134
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,231
Javier, pay him.

135
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:20,905
Oh, Mr. Jeremias,

136
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:24,067
l want you to meet my best friend,
Nacho Castillo.

137
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,946
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How are you, young man?

138
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:30,916
What place are you going hunting?

139
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:33,042
Well, we are going to Filo de Caballo.

140
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:37,019
Do you know how far we are from there?

141
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,852
Did you say Filo de Caballo?

142
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:45,194
The problem is not the distance,
young lady,

143
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:47,027
but how to get out of there.

144
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,432
You're about ten...or...

145
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,664
fifteen minutes away.

146
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,776
l have something for you
that could be useful.

147
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:03,274
One million pesos.

148
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,209
And l guarantee that it's a gift...

149
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,516
considering what you plan to do.

150
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,115
Well...l don't know...

151
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,386
We don't understand
what you're talking about.

152
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,893
We're just going hunting.

153
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:18,328
Listen to me, you kids!

154
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:21,525
You are not going
on a normal hunting trip.

155
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:27,200
For an additional
ten thousand pesos...

156
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:32,234
l can tell you
the story of that place.

157
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:33,972
Well, Mr. Jeremias,
thank you for everything.

158
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,604
Follow me.
l need to tell you something.

159
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:37,148
Kids. Don't go, man.

160
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,309
Look, you guys, l'll give it to you
for half a million pesos!

161
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,046
You'll need it!

162
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,317
Hey, Mr. Jeremias,
Mr. Jeremias, listen.

163
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,483
How much do you want
for this helmet?

164
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,151
Go to the pickup.

165
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,666
Can't you see where this old man lives?

166
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:00,831
He's crazy!

167
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:03,340
What's that he said
that we need to get ready for war?

168
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,569
l don't understand.

169
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:07,169
Those are just stupid ramblings.
Don't pay attention to him.

170
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:11,012
Anyway, if you want to hang around
and talk, that's your business.

171
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,244
lt's getting late.
l am going ahead.

172
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:39,506
What a weird guy, huh?

173
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,344
l don't know, Nacho, but there is
something he said that l don't like.

174
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,213
Yeah. You're right.

175
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,047
Well, don't worry about it.

176
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,417
l'll make sure Mauricio
tells us what it is about.

177
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:51,412
Let's go.

178
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:01,955
Hey, and Charly?

179
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,899
We'll see you, Jeremias.

180
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,375
l'll come by another day!

181
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,673
Thank you.

182
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,417
How did you get that? How much
did he charge you for the helmet?

183
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:29,256
l didn't pay for it.
l just paid the tax.

184
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,779
This is the closest place to the lake.

185
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:28,945
We are about 1 ,000 feet from there,
so you have to unload everything.

186
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,952
Sorry about that, Alejandra.
We have to carry it.

187
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:38,053
But let's get his help, right?

188
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,461
Go on, wake him up.

189
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,190
Pull!

190
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,418
That's as far as it will go.

191
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:09,519
Well, then, it's done.

192
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:11,085
- lt's done?
- lt's done.

193
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:12,858
Make sure it is well tied down,
otherwise the wind will blow it away!

194
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,196
lt's done. The knot is real good!

195
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,256
Perfect.

196
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,860
Then it's ready. lt is perfect!

197
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:20,530
We do fit, right?

198
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:21,937
With Charly?

199
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,304
No. We won't fit.

200
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,543
Let's go to the boat
for the rest of the stuff.

201
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,075
Careful.

202
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,644
Javier! Look for
the other rag, please.

203
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:37,711
Sure.

204
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,519
Darn it! lt is getting late.

205
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,051
Are you guys not going
to get your swimsuits on?

206
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:44,891
The day is great to sunbathe.

207
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:47,394
No, l don't have time for that.

208
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,458
We have little light left,
and l want to go after that damned bear.

209
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,400
Javier, are you not
going to stay with us?

210
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:58,239
l know what l'll miss,
but you heard Mauricio.

211
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,904
Remember we're dealing with a bet.

212
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,242
Yes. Let's go.

213
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,153
We'll see you, baby!

214
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:17,258
Let's go. Mauricio is leaving.

215
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,318
Gimme.

216
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:47,800
ls that it?

217
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:49,135
No. l don't think so.

218
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,971
Finding a bear is not that easy.

219
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,977
That must have been Mauricio.

220
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,070
He must have confused it with a rabbit.

221
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:01,309
Hey! What's wrong with you?
What did you shoot at?

222
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:02,478
A rabbit.

223
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:04,818
A rabbit?
We came here for a bear!

224
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,151
By shooting you only scare it away!

225
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:09,660
Don't do it again!

226
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,735
Now it's your turn.
You go for it.

227
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,065
Carlota!

228
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,129
Diana!

229
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:08,638
Hey, Nacho.

230
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:10,773
Do you really think
we're going to find something?

231
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:12,874
l think the bear story is not true.

232
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,976
Oh, please, Alejandra!

233
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:16,748
What happened to that optimism?

234
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,313
We just got here,
and already you're exasperated?

235
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,018
Give it your best!

236
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:23,118
Charly, are we going
to search or not?

237
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:24,856
All right.
l'll search over there.

238
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:50,988
Charly!

239
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:54,658
l found human remains.

240
00:26:57,896 --> 00:26:59,158
Let's go! Let's go!

241
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:17,272
Don't worry. lt wasn't anything.
You'll be fine tomorrow.

242
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,340
Thank you, Nacho.
l owe you one.

243
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:21,408
Hey, Javier.

244
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:23,181
Lucky these guys came, right?

245
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:25,223
At least they were good for something.

246
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,089
l'm going over to Mauricio's.

247
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,422
He has something to tell me.

248
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:33,697
Do you want some advice?

249
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:39,362
Why don't you go and ask Charly
how l get when l'm upset.

250
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:41,372
That could help you a lot!

251
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:52,211
Listen.

252
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,377
l think it was a mistake
to bring the women.

253
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,784
Why don't they just leave?

254
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,346
They're just a burden,
don't you agree?

255
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,216
Are you going to get started?

256
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:03,727
Very funny. l don't think l have
anything to do here.

257
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:05,888
Well, anyway.

258
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:08,524
l came to do my thing,
and you can do what you want.

259
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,898
Look, l can't decide for your friends,

260
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,563
but l think the best thing to do
is to spend the night here.

261
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,572
l already told you what l saw,
Mauricio.

262
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,541
And you better tell me
what you know about this place.

263
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,703
lt's nonsense, the old man's stories!

264
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,909
Well, stories or not, there's a boy
in the forest that's completely mutilated!

265
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:26,712
And what about the trap
that Javier fell in?

266
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:29,447
There's someone else here
besides us. Who is it?

267
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,284
lt could be the one they call Jesse.

268
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,757
According to Jeremias,
Jesse was an American soldier

269
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:38,455
who came here after the war
to live with some friends.

270
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:43,228
As a matter of fact,
Jeremias' truck was theirs.

271
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:46,930
Supposedly
this Jesse guy went mad.

272
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:49,064
He thinks he's still at war.

273
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,269
Furthermore, he thinks
everyone is his enemy.

274
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,938
No! Are you crazy or what?

275
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:56,605
Why did you keep all this to yourself?

276
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,546
Why didn't you tell us before?

277
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,107
Because l don't believe in those things.

278
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:08,681
Did you hear that?

279
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,794
A while ago l heard it,
but on the other side.

280
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:17,468
lt must be a rabbit,
or something else.

281
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:30,776
Turn the lamps off!

282
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,488
Don't fire, Mauricio!

283
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,330
lt's impossible for us to see him!

284
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,832
So, just stories.

285
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,171
lt's Viviana.

286
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:03,509
Did someone see where she went?

287
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,516
l just saw her go over there.

288
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,178
l told you! Women are a problem!

289
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,687
Wait for me here.

290
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:11,847
l'll go get her.

291
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:13,857
Be very careful, Nacho.

292
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:26,259
l am in the river.

293
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,192
No!

294
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:16,297
Viviana is dead.

295
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,433
What?

296
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:22,070
What are you saying?

297
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:24,377
l'm sorry. lt's the truth.

298
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:34,391
We can't waste any more time.

299
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,950
We've got to get
out of this place somehow!

300
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:38,017
Let's go.

301
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:40,656
Mauricio, Viviana is dead.
Didn't you hear it?

302
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:41,892
That's not my problem.

303
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:44,901
Before leaving l told both of them
what we were going to do here.

304
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:46,061
So let's go.

305
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:48,799
No, no, wait a minute!
You're not giving orders here.

306
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:51,239
Besides, to leave right now
would be stupid.

307
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:54,608
That guy knows this place
better than us.

308
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,840
Charly, Alejandra, and l are staying.

309
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:59,247
Javier and Carlota
can decide for themselves.

310
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:00,807
Do you agree?

311
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:05,916
Nacho is right. We're staying.

312
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:10,786
All right, but then someone
has to stand guard here.

313
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:13,092
l think that's a good idea.

314
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,325
What do you say we start with you?

315
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,267
We have to gather the ammunition
in one or two bags.

316
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:24,099
We better spend the night in this tent.

317
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:58,641
Okay, guys.

318
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:00,973
l think this is it.

319
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:02,171
Are you ready?

320
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:05,808
How ridiculous you are! You want us
to stay two more days here or what?

321
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:07,476
Okay. Javier and Charly, go ahead.

322
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:08,814
Get the women in the middle.

323
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,151
Mauricio and l will cover you.

324
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:12,211
Be careful.

325
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,717
Hey, Nacho! Mauricio!

326
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:24,227
Hurry up. The pickups
are over here. Let's go!

327
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:47,406
Grab here!

328
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:48,975
Come on, climb!

329
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:50,579
Hey, Nacho.

330
00:36:51,656 --> 00:36:54,420
l think something happened to my hand.

331
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:55,925
Can you cure me?

332
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:57,154
On the hand?

333
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,432
lt's dirt. lt's nothing. Let's go!

334
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,829
Hey, baby.

335
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,441
Hey, Alejandra!
What's the matter with you?

336
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:20,840
You can't be fooled
if you have been warned.

337
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:26,013
Alejandra! Again?

338
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,454
Hey! He's over there.

339
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,855
That crazy guy.
He went into the woods.

340
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,798
Let's get out of here.
We have to hurry.

341
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:37,960
No, Nacho, wait!

342
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,129
This guy has traps all over the place.

343
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:43,139
lf we don't catch him now,
we will never be able to get out of here.

344
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,638
He's right.

345
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:48,974
Javier, drive the pickup.

346
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,709
You all go ahead with him.
We'll ride in the back.

347
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:52,772
Hurry up!

348
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:50,763
This is it.

349
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:52,537
lf we follow him,
we can hunt him down.

350
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,599
Let's go!

351
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:56,379
We can't let him go alone.

352
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:24,296
He can't be far.

353
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,299
Let's go after him.

354
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,258
Please!

355
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,544
Carlota! No!

356
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:17,205
- Wait.
- Let go of me.

357
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:18,270
- Calm down.
- Let go of me.

358
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:20,817
- Calm down, Javier.
- No!

359
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,943
How are we going to get out of here?

360
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,954
Wait for me here.
l'm going to check around.

361
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:10,296
We shouldn't have ever
chased the madman.

362
00:43:12,036 --> 00:43:14,027
l don't know how we listened to you!

363
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,648
Hey, Charly,
l don't see Nacho.

364
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:29,379
Alejandra, come.

365
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:31,821
Don't worry.

366
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:33,481
Soon we will get out of here.

367
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:36,151
That guy can't be smarter than us.

368
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,492
You're an idiot!

369
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:45,327
Viviana and Carlota are dead
because of you, or haven't you noticed?

370
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:49,236
l going to check to see
how Javier is doing.

371
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:18,766
Do you feel better?

372
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,373
What happened was terrible.

373
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:26,000
l understand.

374
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,545
But that's life!

375
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:30,842
We all run the same risk.

376
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,214
You have to accept it.

377
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:37,345
What do you mean, Mauricio?

378
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:40,390
Look, let's not fool ourselves, Javier.

379
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:43,222
Carlota and Viviana
were just a temporary fling for us.

380
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,161
Furthermore they're the ones
who wanted to come.

381
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,720
lt's not your fault.

382
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,401
You're crazy, Mauricio.

383
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:58,802
- lt's Javier and Mauricio.
- Let's go.

384
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,008
Nacho!

385
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:44,452
Mauricio!

386
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,179
You go that way.

387
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:12,379
Nacho!

388
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:33,260
Alejandra! Are you all right?

389
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:45,849
l'm fine. l hurt my ankle,
but it's nothing.

390
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:49,844
Drop to the ground!

391
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,421
Alejandra, don't move.

392
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,026
Charly should be close by.

393
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:39,791
Nacho!

394
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:41,793
Alejandra!

395
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:48,737
Charly! We're down here!

396
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:50,803
Remove the branches.

397
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:55,952
How did you get in there?

398
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,419
What a dummy.

399
00:47:57,488 --> 00:48:00,116
Remove the branches
so we can get out. Move it!

400
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:13,765
Nacho and Alejandra are down there.

401
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:15,099
Help them get out.

402
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:27,912
There it goes. Grab it.

403
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,119
You got here just in time, Charly!

404
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:41,631
And not just that,
l blew the madman's hand off!

405
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,689
- What?
- Yes!

406
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,463
- How did you blow one of his hands off?
- With a shot! Pow!

407
00:48:46,537 --> 00:48:48,971
l blew his hand off.
Look at the puddle of blood.

408
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,974
That's my Charly!
Good old Charly!

409
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:54,135
That should stop him chasing us.

410
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:55,644
- Yeah.
- Although...

411
00:48:56,213 --> 00:48:57,805
We'd better try to get out of here.

412
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,815
l think that if we follow the river,
it will take us directly to the road.

413
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:03,875
Could be.

414
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:05,148
Let's go, let's go. Hurry up.

415
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:23,617
Well, this time you were wrong.

416
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:26,454
Because here...

417
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,521
there's no sign of a road!

418
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:30,522
l know.

419
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:33,126
But as long we don't have to see
that maniac again,

420
00:51:33,203 --> 00:51:34,966
l don't mind walking all day.

421
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,699
Let's go.

422
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,734
Guys! l found the road.

423
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:20,075
That's my Charly!

424
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,412
We made it, guys!

425
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,913
Hey! Look over there.

426
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:33,820
lt's Jeremias' truck.

427
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:51,106
Home sweet home.

428
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:52,436
We made it!

429
00:53:57,014 --> 00:54:00,950
l never thought l'd be so happy
to see Jeremias.

430
00:54:01,018 --> 00:54:02,007
Well, knock.

431
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,284
Don't waste your time knocking.

432
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:07,789
The damned man must be sleeping.

433
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:09,621
Besides, he's half deaf.

434
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:12,059
Well, then, go right in.

435
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:19,691
Jeremias!

436
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,965
You see? What did l tell you?

437
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:24,132
The old man must be real drunk.

438
00:54:24,207 --> 00:54:26,141
His bed is behind that curtain.

439
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:27,471
Let's wake him up.

440
00:54:27,544 --> 00:54:28,636
Hurry, hurry.

441
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:36,775
What happened?

442
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:54,328
lt's impossible!

443
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:57,172
That was Jesse.

444
00:54:57,674 --> 00:54:59,335
l don't know how.

445
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:01,240
l don't know how,
but he got ahead of us!

446
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:06,173
Let's go, please.
We have to go, please!

447
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:08,683
Calm down, Mauricio!
We can't go out now.

448
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:10,344
He must be waiting for us outside.

449
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,409
Pay attention!

450
00:55:11,488 --> 00:55:13,854
The worst thing we could do
is leave this place!

451
00:55:14,925 --> 00:55:17,018
No! l'm leaving.

452
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:18,789
l am leaving.
You want to kill me.

453
00:55:18,862 --> 00:55:20,261
You all want to kill me!

454
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:23,926
l'll take care of him.

455
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:27,197
Mauricio!

456
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:22,320
Charly.

457
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:25,225
- Charly, are you okay?
- l can't see!

458
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,309
Alejandra!

459
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:14,323
Wake up!

460
00:59:15,332 --> 00:59:16,594
Alejandra is gone.

461
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:18,656
Come on.

462
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:38,446
What are you doing?

463
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:41,046
Can't you see?
We need weapons and bullets.

464
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,422
Calm down.

465
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:44,790
Listen to me!

466
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:45,953
Calm down, Nacho!

467
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,362
What's the matter?
That guy took Alejandra.

468
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:51,959
That guy wants to play with us.

469
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:54,526
And l don't think that this
is the way to play his game!

470
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:56,333
Okay, what do you suggest?

471
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:58,567
Let's go to town for help.

472
00:59:58,642 --> 01:00:01,236
Don't speak nonsense!
You are making me waste time.

473
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:02,300
Look.

474
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:05,177
This guy is not going to hurt Alejandra.

475
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:07,773
What he wants is for you to go after him.

476
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:10,981
lf that wasn't the case, he would have
already killed us when he was here.

477
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:13,488
All right, Charly, all right.

478
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:15,285
And how do you plan to get to town?

479
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:18,056
There's a vehicle outside.

480
01:00:18,128 --> 01:00:20,323
l don't know what it is doing there,
but let's go in it.

481
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:25,667
That's it, my Charly.

482
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:26,997
What you're saying isn't that bad.

483
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:28,559
But you know what?

484
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:30,767
lt's best if you go by yourself.

485
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:33,572
- But how am l going to go by myself?
- Yes, Charly, pay attention.

486
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:34,837
That way l can get ahead.

487
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:36,845
lf l find the guy, l will light a fire.

488
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:38,904
That will make it easier
for you to find the place!

489
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:40,847
Do you understand?

490
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:41,906
Sure.

491
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,885
Sure, you're right!

492
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:46,855
Let's get going, my Charly.

493
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:48,550
We're running out of time.

494
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:55,587
Be careful.

495
01:00:55,665 --> 01:00:56,654
You too.

496
01:01:10,947 --> 01:01:11,936
No!

497
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:19,949
Charly!

498
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:36,794
Damn you.

499
01:03:43,933 --> 01:03:45,525
Son of a bitch!

500
01:03:45,602 --> 01:03:47,194
You are going to die.

501
01:06:17,086 --> 01:06:18,417
Nacho!

502
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:41,368
Alejandra!

503
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:01,483
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

504
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:08,925
And Charly?

505
01:08:14,537 --> 01:08:16,300
Charly is dead.

506
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,178
Take cover!

507
01:09:24,073 --> 01:09:25,540
Nacho...

508
01:09:25,608 --> 01:09:27,041
he brought me through that tunnel.

509
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:29,270
On the other side
we'll be close to the road.

510
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:35,573
Let's go!

511
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:53,457
Let's go.

512
01:10:05,982 --> 01:10:08,143
l'm sure that Jeremias' truck
is close by.

513
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,140
Let's go.

514
01:11:31,534 --> 01:11:33,661
Hurry up! Come on!
