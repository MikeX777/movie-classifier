1
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,505
Oh!! Ah!! Oh!

2
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:13,109
Get in the game Louis.

3
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,640
Louis!?

4
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,015
Louis!?

5
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:33,609
What is it?

6
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:39,749
I just had a great story idea.

7
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,937
You can't even sleep
without working can you?

8
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,249
You ready?

9
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,102
Yeah, just
finishing up my homework.

10
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:57,437
Ok, wrap it up.

11
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:02,390
Come on, lets go.

12
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,374
How does this tie look?

13
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,895
I think you should lose it.

14
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,208
I always where this tie.

15
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,012
Yeah, but it's not
going to go with that suit.

16
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,896
You're trying to
hard to look like Kyle.

17
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,629
Ha. I can feel it
ladies, this is the one.

18
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,049
You always say that.

19
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,559
Well, after today it'll be fact!

20
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,699
Alright, don't forget
Makayla has her play tonight

21
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,532
and you promised to help
her with her short film script.

22
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:23,973
Ok, ok, got it.

23
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,891
Do your best at the meeting,
it will be nice to have you back

24
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:30,559
on the weekends.
Come here, love you. Good luck.

25
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:32,532
Ready?

26
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:35,199
Okay.Yeah.

27
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:35,907
Love you daddy!

28
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,325
Love you too.

29
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:46,680
Louis!

30
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:49,122
Get in the game.

31
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:52,536
Yeah...yeah, sorry.

32
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,168
Take that tie off!

33
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,504
What? Why?

34
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:04,059
Because I'm wearing a
tie, you don't need too.

35
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,708
This is my favorite tie.

36
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:10,520
It might
intimidate him...take it off!

37
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:12,449
Yours won't?

38
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:15,991
I'm required to wear a tie.

39
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,574
You should look more disheveled.

40
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:19,866
I've always worn
this tie in a meet -

41
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,865
Harold will be with
you in just moment.

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,208
Thank you...

43
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,028
not in this one.

44
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,895
Harold!

45
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,208
Jeff.

46
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:39,739
Kyle...

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,282
Ah.

48
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,407
Harold this is my client Louis.

49
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,824
-Louis.
-Ah, pleasure to meet you Harold.

50
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,645
You boys want anything to drink?

51
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,872
We're good, thank you.

52
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,450
Ice green tea, no sweetener.

53
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:59,241
Harold, I just
want to say thank you

54
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:00,607
for having us here today.

55
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:03,536
Louis and I are both very excited
that you are interested in his script--

56
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:04,698
I'm not.

57
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:12,543
Let me handle this.

58
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,219
Harold, you seem to have caught
us a little bit off guard here,

59
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:20,679
if um, if you are not
interested in the script then...

60
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:22,638
We're looking for
out of the box stories,

61
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,434
but within the box of
the mainstream audiences

62
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,310
right that's disaster
pictures, espionage thrillers,

63
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,932
superhero pictures,
astronaut pictures.

64
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:32,122
Your script doesn't
fit those categories.

65
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:35,694
So...

66
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,158
So, do you have
any scripts that do?

67
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,413
Your writing's got heart.

68
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:41,914
I'm sure you've got a
script up your sleeve

69
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,379
that's more mainstream.

70
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:47,450
Yes!Well not at the moment -

71
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,512
Let me handle this.

72
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,045
Uh, yes Harold, I do.

73
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,918
Actually, I have
an astronaut film.

74
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,256
Great. Send it over Kyle.

75
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,903
I'll have my interns
read it this weekend.

76
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:04,904
Oh, well Harold,
it's not quite finished yet...

77
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:06,386
We'll have it to you Monday.

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,573
Louis just has to put
the final touches on it.

79
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,616
Great. I'll see you then.

80
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,339
Ah, thank you.

81
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:30,348
I said no sweetener.

82
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,905
What the hell was that!?

83
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,769
That..that was me saving
us, that's what that was!

84
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:44,490
Louis, you don't
have a space script!

85
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,550
Then why did you say we
would have one by Monday!?

86
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,949
Because I want to make a deal.

87
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,128
Ok. And it's either his
way or no way. Alright!?

88
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:53,254
Harold has zero patience. None!

89
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,505
So it's either you play ball or
he kicks you out of the game!

90
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:58,657
See this is why you
need to let me handle

91
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:00,847
these situations - you don't
get these exec types...

92
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:03,098
I get them well enough Kyle!

93
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,011
Ok, alright, you know what?

94
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,528
You're right, you're older more
experienced, have gone to what?

95
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:10,781
Twelve failed meetings?

96
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,866
Sure, you got this buddy.

97
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,074
Good luck with the
script, see ya at the movies!

98
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:17,394
Kyle? Kyle! Wait, Kyle!

99
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,238
I got anxious ok? I'm sorry.

100
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,197
It's just...it's just earlier, I

101
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:27,823
had this idea about an astronaut
who crash lands onto earth -

102
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,863
Louis ok right!
I'll get you a deal.

103
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:33,920
If you can get this script
to me, written, by Monday.

104
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:36,316
And Harold goes for it,
some reason goes for it.

105
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:37,817
I'll keep you as my client.

106
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,151
But if he doesn't, you
can't get your shit together,

107
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:41,363
I'm going to drop you.

108
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,281
Kyle! Who are we kidding?
I'm your only client.

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,448
I have five now, thank you.

110
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,831
I can cut my
losses where I need it.

111
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,623
And I think an unsold,
stubborn writer who bounces from

112
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,128
agent to agent, counts as that.

113
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,985
Hope you don't have
any plans this weekend.

114
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,300
-Hey dad.
-Hey.

115
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:08,242
Guess what?

116
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:12,277
I'm almost done with my script.

117
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:14,105
Ugh, I wish I
could say the same.

118
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:15,347
Mom home?

119
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:16,722
No, not yet.

120
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,652
Ok, well when she
gets here tell her

121
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:22,503
I'll be in the office
working all weekend.

122
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,777
Dad?

123
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:26,433
What?

124
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,769
Did you seriously forget?

125
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:31,683
Forget what?

126
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,152
Forget what?

127
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:39,636
You know what, I don't have
time for these little games,

128
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,630
Daddy's got work to do.

129
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:56,032
Hey, how was school?

130
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:57,105
Good.

131
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,824
Good. Dad home?

132
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,825
Yes ma'am, he forgot again.

133
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,370
Did he really?

134
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,988
Mmhmm.

135
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,062
Ok, I'll talk to him.

136
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:08,378
How's your short
film script coming?

137
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,838
It's good. I'm almost finished.

138
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:14,323
I was hoping dad
and I could read it, but

139
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,472
I don't think
he's going to have the time.

140
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,657
Louis?

141
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,659
Hey.

142
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,438
You can't work
again this weekend.

143
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,730
Honey, I have to. The
RLO exec likes my writing,

144
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,356
but, they want something
a little more mainstream.

145
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:40,946
That's great honey but,
Makayla has a play tonight

146
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,150
and a soccer game tomorrow,

147
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:43,699
and she's trying to get
her short film script -

148
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:45,050
Oh...is that what I forgot?

149
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:46,308
Yes!

150
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:50,324
Alyssa...I can't, ok.

151
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:51,981
I have to have this
script done by Monday

152
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,652
or else I'll lose my
chance and Kyle.

153
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:55,903
You can barely stand Kyle.

154
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,573
But he's the
only option I've got.

155
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,902
Well, can you take a break and
try to make it out to both events?

156
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,241
I don't know, I mean,

157
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:08,402
I could always catch
another soccer game?

158
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,761
You haven't been
to one this season.

159
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:12,480
That's not fair, come on.

160
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,864
You know I have
been working alright,

161
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:17,270
I am on the crux of this.
Everything I've been dreaming about,

162
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:20,191
everything I've been
working on lies in this script.

163
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,152
Well can you ask for
a couple more days?

164
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:24,081
Makayla needs
you this weekend.

165
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,363
Ok. Umm...

166
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,105
Ill take a break, alright,

167
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,106
I'll come out to the play,
but that's the best I can do.

168
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:33,855
What about her short film?

169
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,699
I can't help her with
that, she needs you Louis.

170
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,908
I'll make something happen, ok.

171
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,878
I love you, alright?

172
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,667
-Wait, you know Monday is--
-Two days from now, yeah.

173
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:45,769
No, its-- -Alyssa, please?

174
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,597
I have to get this done.

175
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,653
Oh, oh, oh!

176
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:32,519
Control,

177
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:34,620
control?

178
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:42,034
Control, this is 5099,
pilot of solo mission Origin.

179
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,508
Upon entrance on Earth's
atmosphere my ship suffered

180
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:46,301
fractures causing a malfunction

181
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:50,885
and a crash landing into an
undetermined body of water.

182
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,444
I by some miracle
survived and have

183
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:58,339
a enough supplement
to sustain me for a week.

184
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,636
All other supplies
were lost with the ship.

185
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,317
If anyone is hearing
this, please send rescue.

186
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:17,933
I have decided that I will
continue on with my mission.

187
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,790
I will forge into
the intercontinent

188
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,292
to study
the topography,

189
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,670
the ecosystem, and
the atmospheric conditions to

190
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:27,441
see if this planet really
is worthy of re...re-

191
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,035
inhabiting.

192
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:35,105
Turning on my homing beacon
now...hoping it still works.

193
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,055
Ah,

194
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,386
please hurry.

195
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,544
5099 over and out.

196
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:50,184
Ehhh...a little wordy.

197
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,928
Well, we'll see about that!

198
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:42,647
Louis...

199
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,498
Louis!

200
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:47,158
I'm sorry,

201
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,584
I'm sorry. Time got
away from me, I forgot.

202
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,475
Forget has been a
popular word with you lately.

203
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,841
Alyssa...

204
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,397
this might be my last chance.

205
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,129
You're a good writer.

206
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:00,233
But nothing is selling! Nothing!

207
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:01,764
Half the time you
didn't have an agent.

208
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:05,640
Half the time I did...and
what do I have to show for it?

209
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:10,647
I can feel
this one, you know,

210
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:13,983
this one is different,
this one is unique.

211
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,960
You say that about all of them,

212
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,655
you just said that last weekend
about the one you just pitched.

213
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,468
Alright no, you're right.
I'll just throw in the towel,

214
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:24,032
I'll just be a stay at home dad,
you be the career woman.

215
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,312
That sounds great.

216
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:26,491
You know that's
not what I'm saying.

217
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:27,657
What are you
saying then Alyssa!?

218
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,366
Oh, I'm sorry I
must have forgot.

219
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,793
What I'm saying is that Makayla
needs you to be present in her life.

220
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,067
I am in her life!

221
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:36,121
Can you remember the last time
you were at any event she

222
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,754
was involved in?

223
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:40,039
Neither can we.

224
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,490
I'm not asking you to
give up your career,

225
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:46,582
I'm asking you to every once in
a while, put us in front of it.

226
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,845
Makayla especially,

227
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:50,699
she's growing up,

228
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:54,137
she's talking to boys,
she wants to be a filmmaker.

229
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,614
Alyssa...

230
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:02,900
if you can just give
me this weekend,

231
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,574
I promise you, I will do better,

232
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:09,199
I will be the filmmaker she
deserves to look up to.

233
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:12,407
Sure whatever you say Louis.

234
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:14,317
You're definitely
a man of your word.

235
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,622
Where do you
think you are going?

236
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,032
You'll thank me later.

237
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:22,403
Makayla!

238
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,491
Why'd you marry him again?

239
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:52,866
Yeah! Yeah, send me, no?
No one else wants to go.

240
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,506
Please! Send me
captain! Yeah, I know

241
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:59,842
there's nothing there, but
still! Let me go, because,

242
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:02,389
I'm a genius and you guys are --

243
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:12,373
Idiots, and I'm the
genius, I'm the genius!

244
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:47,241
Control, this is 5099
pilot of solo mission Origin,

245
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:48,741
I don't know if you
received the memo

246
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:52,444
but I am stranded here on Earth,
please send rescue, over.

247
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,866
Control, this is 5099
pilot of solo mission Origin,

248
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:03,367
I'm getting a
little chaffed here...

249
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:06,209
some ointment would be
greatly appreciated, over.

250
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:10,746
Roger that 5099, we
received your transmission

251
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:14,295
and will be sending spa
treatment right away over?

252
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:16,772
You will!?

253
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:25,147
I'm saved! I'm
saved! Oh! Aw! Oh.

254
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,639
I am gonna make it,

255
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,662
I gotta make it.

256
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,701
You hear that control.

257
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:52,076
I'm going to make it to
that ridge, by nightfall,

258
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:57,700
and then, I'm
probably going to die.

259
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,576
Um, Excuse me sir,
Uhh we're closing up now.

260
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,006
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

261
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,936
Come on, don't stop.

262
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,548
Don't stop.

263
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,772
What happens next, what happens
next., what happens next.

264
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:25,326
Oh oh oh ahhh!

265
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:01,777
Hello?

266
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,612
Hey champ how's it going?

267
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:06,906
Oh, it's going, I'm
on page twenty six.

268
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:09,465
Woah! Now
we're cooking with gas!

269
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:12,199
Grff, yeah, I um,

270
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,031
I don't know man,

271
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:17,660
I just don't know what
happens next, I'm kinda stuck.

272
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:19,453
Woah, woah, woah. Louis, Louis

273
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,410
you don't have time
to be stuck, clock is ticking.

274
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:25,957
Did you call just
to harass me, Kyle?

275
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:29,438
Hey man, I just wanted to
see how you were doing.

276
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:30,981
Glad to hear
you're staying focused.

277
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:31,982
Talk to you soon.LOUIS:
Wait, before you go...

278
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,074
what time?

279
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:22,345
Hello?

280
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:28,368
Anybody home?

281
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,439
Uhh, Thank God.

282
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:39,111
There was not enough time.

283
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:40,998
...they weren't even trying

284
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:41,938
Hey!

285
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:42,970
I know that's when...

286
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:44,853
How was the game!? Did you win?

287
00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:47,811
Makayla?

288
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:56,384
Hey. Did they win or lose?

289
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:58,939
Alyssa?

290
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:05,814
Ok, I see what's
happening, the silent treatment?

291
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,431
Ok, you want to play
the silent treatment, I can too.

292
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,220
Bottoms up.

293
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:48,368
Control, this is 5099,
pilot of solo mission Origin.

294
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:50,203
After several days of walking
through an undetermined

295
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:53,788
continent of earth I have found
the atmosphere rather dense,

296
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:57,603
oxygen levels high,
sustainable organic growth.

297
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:01,912
I am halting my expedition
due to lack of food supplies.

298
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:04,538
I will set up a
primitive base camp here at the

299
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:08,001
coordinates in which I hope
you are receiving this message.

300
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,709
I see a clearing in
which a ship can properly land.

301
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:15,056
Be wary of steep entry,

302
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:19,048
the atmosphere is much denser
than expected, the shields will not hold.

303
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,712
Ahh, I guess that's it.

304
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,642
Thank you control.
Oh, one other thing.

305
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,040
Oompf....

306
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:07,001
Ahhhhh...hmmm.

307
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:19,244
Ahhh... Huh. Ahh.

308
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:36,151
Hey..ok, hey look,

309
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:38,955
I'm unarmed alright.

310
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:42,306
Can you, can you
understand me?

311
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:48,705
Ok. Alright. I'm... I'm just
going to sit down right here.

312
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:51,046
Oh!

313
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:55,415
Wow!

314
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:59,087
Dinner looks great.

315
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,267
Mmmm...what did you get on it?

316
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:29,767
B minus

317
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,584
It's ok, I know it was hard.

318
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:33,766
Yeah...

319
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,744
Mmmm...May I join you?

320
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,744
Aren't we being a little cruel?

321
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,298
You don't have to join me, I
just can't talk to him right now

322
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,173
Come on, finish your dinner.

323
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,101
So...

324
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:31,234
are there more, people,
like you, around here?

325
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:39,140
Do you have names?

326
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:44,843
My name is 5099.
I come from up there.

327
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,944
Yeah, alright

328
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,904
at least I'm getting
some vital signs.

329
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,804
Uhh, I come
from a place called Mars.

330
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:57,734
There are millions and millions
of people like you and I there.

331
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:00,193
Well, We all come from here, but

332
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,569
thousands of years ago Earth
was overpopulated and diseased,

333
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,765
and world wide wars
broke out.

334
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,891
And the earth was destroyed.

335
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:16,230
But my, your ancestors
found a new home for us.

336
00:28:16,814 --> 00:28:20,007
The fact that you are
here is an absolute miracle.

337
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:27,804
Great.

338
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,991
You make the greatest
discovery of the century

339
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:36,507
and they are simpletons that
understand absolutely nothing.

340
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:04,256
Control, this is 5099
pilot of solo mission Origin,

341
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:06,264
I have found life on Earth!

342
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,913
Repeat, I have found two human
specimens both female on earth.

343
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:13,202
No signs as of yet
of any male counterparts

344
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:14,296
or other inhabitants.

345
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:16,195
Please hurry.

346
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,340
I will continue to study
them in the meantime.

347
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:21,241
5099 over and out.

348
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:33,226
Rise and shine.

349
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:37,796
Hey, how are-- 
wait no no no!

350
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:43,679
I thought we
were friends now, hmm?

351
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:24,030
Now that's how you go fishing.

352
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:28,481
Haha...oh, yeah,
too soon, I felt that.

353
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:07,219
Thanks Mom.

354
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,749
Dad did this.

355
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:11,151
Haha, good one.

356
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:13,280
No, really, I didn't do this.

357
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,116
Really?

358
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,038
So...

359
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,671
do either of you have a name?

360
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:32,632
Didn't think so.
Just checking...again.

361
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:36,515
Thought you two would open
up a little bit more by now.

362
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,818
Well... I think you two deserve
the honor of having names...

363
00:33:42,903 --> 00:33:44,038
What do you think?

364
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:49,187
I'll take that as a
yes. Okay, you...

365
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,859
your name will be,

366
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:00,179
I don't know. How about Ava?

367
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,796
Yeah, Ava that's an old
fashion earth name right?

368
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,178
Ok, Ava it is.

369
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:12,273
And you little one,
since you are so small.

370
00:34:14,038 --> 00:34:16,069
Haha, how about
we call you Minnie?

371
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:21,976
Minnie, Minnie, Minnie, Minnie.

372
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:25,587
Oh my God,

373
00:34:27,163 --> 00:34:29,396
you both can
understand me can't you?

374
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,116
Come in.

375
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:52,054
Hey.

376
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:53,733
Hey.

377
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,944
Talking now huh?

378
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:58,491
Making breakfast now huh?

379
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:02,084
Yeah, I cooked the
eggs a little too long?

380
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,015
Yeah. It's alright though.

381
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:09,977
How's it going?

382
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:12,478
Not too bad,
I've got about 40 pages,

383
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:17,772
I need to have
about 30 by 9am tomorrow.

384
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:19,988
Ouch.

385
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,210
Yeah.

386
00:35:23,036 --> 00:35:24,243
Well I'll leave you to it.

387
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:25,341
Hey Makayla,

388
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:27,499
I'm sorry about all this.

389
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:30,089
Once I'm finished
with this I promise you

390
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:32,624
I will focus more
on you and mom, ok.

391
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:38,538
Hey! I got an idea, how
about I read you my script

392
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:40,140
like I used to, remember?

393
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:44,834
Nah, hey, how
about you help me with

394
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:47,001
my short film on Tuesday?

395
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:48,297
Short film?

396
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:51,318
You're making a
short film on Tuesday?

397
00:35:51,506 --> 00:35:54,820
Dad! I told you two weeks ago.

398
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:58,889
I know. Look, I promise you
I'll help you out and I

399
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:01,226
will read the
script beforehand ok.

400
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:03,347
Whatever dad.

401
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:05,126
Oh, I'll whatever you!

402
00:36:27,512 --> 00:36:31,033
Control, this 5099

403
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,845
pilot of solo mission origin,

404
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:37,220
after spending
several weeks studying

405
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:40,072
and interacting
closely with Ava and Minnie,

406
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,454
I have found that
they are naturally intelligent,

407
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:48,274
although our lack of ability
to communicate is immense,

408
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:50,345
they seem to understand me,

409
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:53,751
and I am beginning
to understand them.

410
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:59,516
I will push to continue
to find out where their male

411
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:01,119
counterparts are and

412
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:04,572
if they know or know of
any humans in the region.

413
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,708
5099 over and out.

414
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,874
Ok,

415
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,689
here's me,

416
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,142
here's you,

417
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:31,040
here's Minni.

418
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,102
Where are these people.

419
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:42,400
Oh, Ok, lovely, very nice,

420
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:44,212
Ava thank you, so much,

421
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,798
listen to me though, Ava...

422
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,783
where are these people? Hmm?

423
00:38:06,348 --> 00:38:07,378
Three?

424
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,902
A third? Where are they?
Can you take me to them?

425
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,907
Owww!

426
00:38:39,146 --> 00:38:40,821
Is that your husband?

427
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,368
Ava, I'm sorry.

428
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:52,016
Are there any others?

429
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:54,587
Besides these three?

430
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,626
Makayla, let's go!?"

431
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,066
Hold on!

432
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:35,491
Hey where you guys-

433
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:44,751
Hello?

434
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:47,169
Hey playa! How's it going?

435
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,345
It's going.

436
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,429
Yeah, you finished yet?

437
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:51,438
Uh, 47.

438
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,141
Yes!

439
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,793
Yeah, not too bad.
it could be worse.

440
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,565
No! Not you!

441
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:59,246
47 that's it?

442
00:39:59,426 --> 00:40:01,347
Harold called this
morning, just checking in.

443
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,431
Yeah?

444
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:05,031
Yeah, so,
are you going to finish?

445
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:08,839
I don't know
man, I'm pretty beat

446
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:11,828
and I haven't spent any time
with my family this weekend.

447
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:12,881
Family!?

448
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:14,687
Louis, your career is at stake

449
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:16,480
and you are
worried about your family?

450
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:18,211
Ugh, you
wouldn't understand?

451
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,212
Oh no, no, no, I
completely understand.

452
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,327
So you're going
to commit to a project

453
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:24,078
that might as well
just be your career

454
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:27,172
and then flake out
because you love your family?

455
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:30,007
Wow, way to
provide to for them Louis.

456
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,570
You listen
here you little prick,

457
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:36,273
everyday I am
working my ass off

458
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:39,008
following these wild
goose chase lead you have me on,

459
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:40,437
what makes this any different!?

460
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:42,625
Because you took
the lead on this one pal!

461
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:45,170
Kyle!? Kyle!?

462
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:47,726
Serves up bad boy! Ah!

463
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:06,922
Control?

464
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,211
Control?

465
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,367
I don't think they
are coming for me Ava.

466
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:43,508
It's my fault,

467
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:47,786
it was my idea.

468
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,383
While other
missions were going off

469
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,930
to other possible
inhabitable planets

470
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,703
I chose the one we destroyed.

471
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:01,592
No one else
thought it was fertile,

472
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,301
I was the only fool who did

473
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:07,742
and they sent
me on my merry way.

474
00:42:09,372 --> 00:42:12,288
But clearly, even
in the worst of times it was

475
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:15,953
fertile, or else
you wouldn't be here.

476
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:24,086
What am I
complaining about.

477
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,201
Louis?

478
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:01,086
Hey.

479
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:05,234
What are you doing?

480
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:08,648
Watching the fire.

481
00:43:10,772 --> 00:43:12,148
Inspiration?

482
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:15,984
Yeah, I guess.

483
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:20,898
I'm almost finished.

484
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,059
Good.

485
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,930
Do you know what it's called?

486
00:43:27,155 --> 00:43:30,405
Mmmhmm.
The Man From Outer Space.

487
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:35,000
Do you know how it ends?

488
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:38,734
I think so.

489
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:46,309
I just don't know what the main
character is going to decide.

490
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:50,062
You will,

491
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:54,211
goodnight.

492
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:56,516
Goodnight.

493
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:02,742
I lov-

494
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:51,725
Ahhhhh!

495
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:54,701
Ava! Wait!

496
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,662
It's alright...

497
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:25,365
Captain? 307?

498
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,616
Who are these people?

499
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:28,358
You were on a solo mission?

500
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:32,824
I can't believe you are here!?

501
00:45:32,908 --> 00:45:35,076
5099, get ahold of yourself.

502
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:39,459
Ava, no no no no.
Ava, Ava, no it's ok.

503
00:45:39,994 --> 00:45:42,202
These, these are
the indigenous people

504
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:44,494
I was telling you
about in my transmissions.

505
00:45:44,787 --> 00:45:46,037
What transmissions?

506
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:49,248
We've received nothing
since your last distress call.

507
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:51,936
Your com gauntlet was
damaged in the crash.

508
00:45:54,272 --> 00:45:56,092
I guess, but
how did you find me?

509
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,631
Beacon, placed under your skin.

510
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,998
Standard procedure
for situations like this.

511
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:03,006
You lit up as soon as
we hit the atmosphere.

512
00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:08,037
Well thank God you're here.

513
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:12,241
You have to believe me
they are not going to hurt you,

514
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:14,450
ok these are my colleagues.

515
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,779
They're here to help us.

516
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:22,407
You don't know how good
it feels to see you both.

517
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,407
How long have
you been with them?

518
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:25,397
What?

519
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,940
How long have you
been with the indigenous?

520
00:46:28,025 --> 00:46:31,506
Ava and Minnie,
about fifteen weeks now.

521
00:46:32,865 --> 00:46:34,449
You've named them?

522
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:35,787
Well they don't
have any language,

523
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:37,545
I had to refer to
them by something.

524
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:39,920
I don't know what
you were thinking.

525
00:46:40,348 --> 00:46:42,597
From now on they will be
called Female 1 and Female 2.

526
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,306
They are not your family.

527
00:46:44,616 --> 00:46:47,574
They are a scientific discovery
and need to be studied properly,

528
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:49,107
not fraternized with.

529
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:51,280
I...I was studying them,
but I didn't have the supplies

530
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:52,217
to study them from afar.

531
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:53,348
Go back to the ship,

532
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:55,996
get yourself cleaned up.

533
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:59,616
We have food supplements
and medical supplies onboard.

534
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,630
We'll watch
female one and female two.

535
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,566
After you are ready, you
will escort us and the females

536
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:08,036
back to whatever
habitat they have occupied.

537
00:47:15,895 --> 00:47:18,520
This is the greatest
scientific find of the century.

538
00:47:18,825 --> 00:47:20,614
I thought for
sure he was lying.

539
00:47:22,364 --> 00:47:24,372
So, what's your plan?

540
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:25,950
Go back to the habitat.

541
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:29,630
Assess. Decide
who to take with us.

542
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:40,596
How do I look?

543
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:42,104
Tired.

544
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,354
The suit.

545
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:46,471
Good. No tie?

546
00:48:48,116 --> 00:48:49,440
Did you finish?

547
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:50,869
No.

548
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:53,705
Well what do you
think's going to happen?

549
00:48:54,785 --> 00:48:57,867
I don't know. I'm hoping
they are going to like it

550
00:48:57,952 --> 00:49:00,729
and give me few a
days to work on it.

551
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:04,518
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for work?

552
00:49:04,973 --> 00:49:05,979
No.

553
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:08,725
Taking a sick day?

554
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,158
No.

555
00:49:10,368 --> 00:49:11,823
Why aren't you getting ready?

556
00:49:12,436 --> 00:49:14,768
I tried to tell you
Friday, it's Labor Day.

557
00:49:19,408 --> 00:49:21,046
Why didn't you tell me?

558
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:22,905
I tried to tell you but
you wouldn't listen.

559
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,947
I know I was distracted,
but you could have tried

560
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:25,907
a little harder!

561
00:49:25,992 --> 00:49:27,992
Don't you dare shout at me!

562
00:49:35,751 --> 00:49:37,358
Yasss.

563
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:39,850
That's good.

564
00:49:42,408 --> 00:49:43,657
Speak.

565
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:44,850
It's labor day.

566
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:45,999
Yeah, so.

567
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,500
So we're not having a meeting
with Harold today are we?

568
00:49:48,774 --> 00:49:52,280
Of course not, Harold is
on his way back from Bermuda.

569
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,553
Louis?

570
00:49:57,762 --> 00:50:01,921
I have slept, maybe...
maybe six hours since Friday,

571
00:50:02,006 --> 00:50:04,172
all because you said
that I had to have a feature

572
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,031
film script done by today.

573
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:08,657
Oh, ok, I'm pretty
sure Harold said that

574
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:09,819
and you agreed to it.

575
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:11,112
I would think that as my agent

576
00:50:11,197 --> 00:50:12,749
maybe you would
help me to understand

577
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,958
that he actually meant Tuesday!

578
00:50:15,063 --> 00:50:18,063
Listen, you were the one that
took control on this remember.

579
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:21,592
If you would have just
let me handle this, it would

580
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:22,967
have been different.

581
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:25,198
Get me the script by today,

582
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:27,397
I'll get it to Harold,
we'll go from there.

583
00:50:27,505 --> 00:50:30,889
This is your career
Louis, don't get sidetracked.

584
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:43,085
Oh, harder baby, harder,
yah that's it...money.

585
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:51,874
I don't have time for this!

586
00:50:52,668 --> 00:50:53,639
Jerk.

587
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:58,577
You're gonna let me say that?

588
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,169
Now from what I have noticed,

589
00:51:03,254 --> 00:51:04,545
they are a nomadic
people, although they stay

590
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,272
contained in one area for
several days at a time,

591
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:09,461
they are very intelligent,

592
00:51:09,546 --> 00:51:13,233
although they don't have any language of
their own, they seem to understand fine.

593
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:14,776
Have you tried
any other languages?

594
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:17,069
A few, yes, but they
don't seem to understand any.

595
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:18,528
They mostly communicate

596
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:22,237
through eye movement, hand
gestures, occasional grunts.

597
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:23,472
No males?

598
00:51:23,557 --> 00:51:24,694
Males are dead.

599
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,352
Have you studied the
ecology of this place?

600
00:51:28,437 --> 00:51:30,585
How did you know
the males were deceased?

601
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:32,592
It's obvious,

602
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,251
if there was a
male specimen here

603
00:51:34,336 --> 00:51:37,336
they would have killed
you instead of taking you in.

604
00:51:40,587 --> 00:51:41,756
What's their diet?

605
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:46,342
Uh, nuts, fruit, primarily,
occasional animal meat.

606
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:47,717
Ah, 307?

607
00:51:48,444 --> 00:51:49,952
It will be nightfall
soon will it not?

608
00:51:50,037 --> 00:51:51,327
Yes, why?

609
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:53,530
We have to leave before then.

610
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:55,616
Oh?

611
00:51:55,848 --> 00:52:00,124
5099, control sent us
on a rescue mission.

612
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:03,394
They gave us supplies but not
enough for a few days here,

613
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:04,624
the trip back is-

614
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:06,210
Twelve weeks, I know.

615
00:52:06,837 --> 00:52:09,108
We only have room for
one other passenger.

616
00:52:10,832 --> 00:52:13,373
Ok, Well we could leave a
communications device here

617
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:14,374
so they can hear my voice.

618
00:52:14,482 --> 00:52:16,422
We could set
up the com right here,

619
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,405
we could setup a
wind turbine right... here.

620
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,489
Female two.

621
00:52:20,574 --> 00:52:21,921
I'm sorry what was that?

622
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,952
We're not taking you.

623
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:25,980
I'm sorry?

624
00:52:26,103 --> 00:52:29,103
We're taking female two.

625
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:34,033
Minnie?

626
00:52:34,475 --> 00:52:36,897
No, no. You can't do that.
What about her mother?

627
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:38,815
You will stay
here with the mother.

628
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,021
We'll set up a com
station, return in a few months.

629
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:44,772
Leave.

630
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,202
Leave the supplies for
the third passenger with me,

631
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:49,328
I can distribute them
appropriately that way I can

632
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:50,889
stay here and study them in
their natural habitat.

633
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:53,413
This is the greatest
discovery in decades,

634
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:55,163
Earth is inhabitable.

635
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:58,108
We have to take one back to
study it, can't you see that?

636
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,350
I understand that, but you
cannot break this family apart.

637
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:02,967
You mean their family?

638
00:53:04,574 --> 00:53:06,491
Yes, their family.

639
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:09,508
This is not our choice,

640
00:53:10,336 --> 00:53:12,680
this decison comes
straight from control.

641
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:16,563
5099, this
is your career at stake.

642
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:20,282
You will be known as
the man, the explorer,

643
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,504
who re-discovered
earth, our homeland.

644
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,948
Nobody believed you,

645
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,976
do you want to let that opportunity
slip through your fingers?

646
00:53:35,652 --> 00:53:36,481
Ok,

647
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,865
ok, lets do it.

648
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,294
Can I talk to them first?

649
00:53:53,545 --> 00:53:54,805
Ava,

650
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:59,845
darling you and Minnie mean
so much to mankind and I know

651
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:03,220
you can't understand
this yet, but your existence

652
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:06,161
is what will allow the
prosperity of our race.

653
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:07,615
We have to study,

654
00:54:07,794 --> 00:54:10,567
ok, and we won't be able to do
that here

655
00:54:10,652 --> 00:54:12,310
for another several months, so,

656
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:13,786
in order to make their,

657
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:16,224
our work faster,

658
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,013
we have to take her.

659
00:54:24,278 --> 00:54:26,981
They need to take Minnie.

660
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:30,908
Wait, no!

661
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:32,692
Huh.

662
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:35,872
Don't touch them.

663
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:38,524
This not how you do this!

664
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,317
Stand down 5099.

665
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,935
I will not stand down!

666
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,561
This is not your call, Major!

667
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,395
I suggest that if you
want to be remembered

668
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,630
as the man
who rediscovered Earth

669
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:49,770
you step aside and let us
do what we came here for.

670
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:51,989
Came here for?

671
00:54:52,395 --> 00:54:54,465
You said this was
a rescue mission.

672
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:57,091
You sly devils,

673
00:54:57,302 --> 00:54:58,966
you got all my
transmissions didn't you?

674
00:54:59,051 --> 00:55:00,259
Your job is to stand down!

675
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:01,219
Liars!

676
00:55:05,864 --> 00:55:09,591
I finished it, I finished it!

677
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:12,677
I finished it!

678
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:18,958
It doesn't
have to be this way.

679
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:21,497
Then do something about it.

680
00:55:24,918 --> 00:55:26,606
I sent the script to Kyle,

681
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:28,950
meeting is tomorrow, 1pm.

682
00:55:29,264 --> 00:55:31,097
Makayla's shoot starts at 4PM.

683
00:55:31,182 --> 00:55:33,390
I know, I know, I'll be there.

684
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,325
She's counting on you.

685
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:00,419
Ava! Ava! Stop.

686
00:56:00,504 --> 00:56:03,333
Ava, Stop, Ava listen.

687
00:56:03,684 --> 00:56:05,474
I'm sorry it was my job ok!

688
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:07,545
I shouldn't have done it,
but I had to.

689
00:56:09,643 --> 00:56:12,373
Ava, Ava I'll leave okay,

690
00:56:12,608 --> 00:56:15,319
but I can't promise you that they
are going to bring her back to you!

691
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:39,897
Where's that
stick you hit me with?

692
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:50,629
How was your weekend?

693
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:52,832
Was Good, was very good.

694
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:55,340
Quite relaxing actually.
How was Bermuda?

695
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,784
Your script Louis. 
Very original.

696
00:56:58,869 --> 00:56:59,707
Thank you.

697
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,504
So my interns tell me.

698
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:03,842
Unfortunately, it's not
quite what I had in mind.

699
00:57:03,927 --> 00:57:06,308
This is a family film,

700
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:07,807
that's not something we do here.

701
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:10,198
Would you consider
developing it with us further?

702
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:12,510
Get it to where you
would like it to be.

703
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:16,471
I'm confident this can be
more than just a family picture.

704
00:57:19,623 --> 00:57:21,205
I have the afternoon free.

705
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:23,448
Convince me.

706
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:30,104
You look concerned Louis.

707
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:37,479
I'm telling you we
should have gone west.

708
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,592
The ship is half
mile east of the camp.

709
00:57:39,879 --> 00:57:42,112
We would have been there in
30 minutes if that were the case.

710
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:43,362
Calm down.

711
00:57:44,316 --> 00:57:45,971
Here, take her
I'll figure this out.

712
00:57:46,056 --> 00:57:47,682
Have you
lost your nerve sergeant?

713
00:57:47,853 --> 00:57:49,561
Don't talk to me like
that, put the girl down.

714
00:57:49,646 --> 00:57:50,708
Get out the beacon.

715
00:57:56,743 --> 00:57:59,367
We should have
taken 5099 with us,

716
00:57:59,452 --> 00:58:00,950
he would
have brought us back.

717
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,122
I'm not the one that hit him.

718
00:58:06,936 --> 00:58:08,372
5099?

719
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,059
It's nothing.

720
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:14,911
Get on with it.

721
00:58:19,092 --> 00:58:20,217
Neutralize.

722
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,138
Oh...

723
00:58:30,522 --> 00:58:31,661
Oh...

724
00:58:32,902 --> 00:58:34,684
Think they got
that transmission?

725
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:42,056
What'd you say champ,

726
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:43,872
you ready to make this happen?

727
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,458
Louis, you gone
deaf, or you just excited?

728
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,974
He's just excited.

729
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:52,958
You have to do this.

730
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:57,122
This is your career on the line.

731
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,388
Louis,

732
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:01,317
say something?

733
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:08,122
Ok,

734
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:12,950
yeah, yeah let's do it.

735
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:27,007
You're such a fool.

736
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:29,208
You'll be court marshaled.

737
00:59:30,075 --> 00:59:32,661
Your career is over.

738
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,317
What does it matter

739
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,325
if I don't have a
family to share it with?

740
00:59:53,741 --> 00:59:58,239
Ok, alright they shouldn't
be following us anymore.

741
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:17,481
Louis,

742
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:19,476
Louis?

743
01:00:20,381 --> 01:00:22,796
Harold asked you a question.

744
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:27,038
I'm so sorry, A.D.D I guess.

745
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,695
Page seventy three...

746
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,706
other than guilt perhaps,

747
01:00:33,493 --> 01:00:35,523
what is 5099's
motivation to chase

748
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:39,265
after his colleagues and
the child, that seems abrupt.

749
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:43,577
Well, I think it's
because he's realized

750
01:00:43,662 --> 01:00:45,578
how important
Minnie is to her mother,

751
01:00:45,663 --> 01:00:47,787
and to he himself.

752
01:00:48,014 --> 01:00:50,499
Ok, alright,

753
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:53,741
in that case he doesn't get
to stay with them in the end.

754
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:00,718
Stay still Jill!

755
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:01,929
I am!

756
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:04,249
Mom, what do you think?

757
01:01:04,904 --> 01:01:09,320
Um, shouldn't she be
in the center of the frame?

758
01:01:09,577 --> 01:01:11,660
No, rule of thirds.

759
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:13,786
Oh, well your dad
should be here any minute,

760
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,226
he can give you more tips.

761
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,491
Ok...

762
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:19,605
How long is
this going to take?

763
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:22,023
It's art Jill,
just let it breathe.

764
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:24,382
Well I've only got two hours.

765
01:01:26,085 --> 01:01:27,257
I know.

766
01:01:28,423 --> 01:01:31,640
So 5099, leaves them at the end?

767
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:36,211
Rescues them, but then the guilt
that he has causes him go his own way

768
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:37,919
because he cares for them.

769
01:01:38,624 --> 01:01:39,749
Exactly.

770
01:01:39,835 --> 01:01:41,288
The best love
stories are the ones

771
01:01:41,373 --> 01:01:43,140
where the people in love
don't get to stay together.

772
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:45,288
No, they need him.

773
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:46,751
Do they?

774
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:50,046
Seems to me they're
getting along just fine

775
01:01:50,131 --> 01:01:51,889
until he
crashes into their life.

776
01:01:58,059 --> 01:01:59,561
And cut.

777
01:02:01,514 --> 01:02:02,998
We're going to go
for another take,

778
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:04,967
but this time,
whistle while you read.

779
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,068
Where is dad?
I need him for my next shot.

780
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:15,803
Ava and Minnie need
a husband and a father.

781
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:21,060
But, in order to
protect them he has to leave.

782
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:23,842
Otherwise it wraps
up a little too neatly.

783
01:02:24,014 --> 01:02:27,490
Life is never like
that, life is never simple.

784
01:02:28,571 --> 01:02:32,959
A final conflict at
the end will really hit home.

785
01:02:42,486 --> 01:02:43,717
Woah,

786
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:49,673
They won't be able
to track you anymore,

787
01:02:50,626 --> 01:02:53,693
but they can track me.
So I need you to stay here.

788
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:55,568
Ok?

789
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:58,201
Don't follow me.

790
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,756
No, no, no!

791
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:14,733
Yeah, I like that.
Harold, that's beautiful.

792
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:17,154
So, story aside,

793
01:03:17,342 --> 01:03:19,545
apart, lets talk
a little about a

794
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:23,717
preliminary ballpark for
a price range on an option.

795
01:03:27,114 --> 01:03:29,030
He can't afford
to hurt them again.

796
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:30,732
What?

797
01:03:33,965 --> 01:03:35,146
You're absolutely right,

798
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:38,313
5099 has to what's
best for the family.

799
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:41,342
He has to leave or
else they're in danger.

800
01:03:42,483 --> 01:03:43,678
Now you're talking.

801
01:03:44,426 --> 01:03:47,599
Yeah, but I'm not 5099...

802
01:03:51,006 --> 01:03:52,615
I have to go to my family.

803
01:03:55,887 --> 01:03:56,967
Excuse me.

804
01:03:57,689 --> 01:03:58,688
Louis?

805
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:00,326
Louis?

806
01:04:00,607 --> 01:04:01,503
Louis,

807
01:04:01,728 --> 01:04:04,279
Louis, woah woah woah,
what are you doing?

808
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,459
Hey, I, listen I
think we have him right

809
01:04:06,544 --> 01:04:08,389
where we want him so,
how about you take over for now,

810
01:04:08,474 --> 01:04:09,390
you're in charge.

811
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:10,779
What are you talking about?

812
01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:12,740
My daughter is
doing her first short film

813
01:04:12,825 --> 01:04:14,532
today and she
kind of needs me to be there.

814
01:04:14,709 --> 01:04:17,250
Listen, You and I both know he
wouldn't be spending all this

815
01:04:17,335 --> 01:04:20,043
time if he wasn't
interested in the script. Huh?

816
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:21,340
Bring it home for us partner.

817
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:24,201
I'll have a new draft in a couple
of days, Harold see you soon.

818
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:27,060
Kyle.

819
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:28,615
Sir.

820
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,693
That is one ballsy
client you have there,

821
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,355
I like him.

822
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:34,599
Thank you.

823
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,053
Trevor!

824
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:40,459
Iced green tea.
No sweetener.

825
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:41,404
Yes sir.

826
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:43,030
No sweetener.

827
01:04:43,535 --> 01:04:44,909
Would you like a drink?

828
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:47,982
He did it.
That son of a gun did it.

829
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:53,459
-Hey hey!
-Where are you?

830
01:04:53,544 --> 01:04:56,365
Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm just
stuck in a little traffic, I'll be there.

831
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,116
It's 4:30 Louis, she's got an
hour and a half to finish this.

832
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,533
I'll make it happen, alright.
I'll see you soon, I promise.

833
01:05:02,618 --> 01:05:03,857
Well hurry up!

834
01:05:08,634 --> 01:05:10,466
He's not coming is he.

835
01:05:12,733 --> 01:05:14,842
Just do the best
you can without him.

836
01:05:19,822 --> 01:05:20,990
Jill!

837
01:05:48,395 --> 01:05:53,353
Hey I'm here! Alyssa!
Makayla, what can I help with?

838
01:06:56,494 --> 01:06:58,869
I read your script
babe, it's amazing.

839
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:00,334
Go to your room.

840
01:07:00,419 --> 01:07:03,205
No no no,
please stay. I'm here ok,

841
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:06,494
look, I know I
messed up, Alyssa?

842
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:17,502
I can't wait to
see your movie babe.

843
01:07:18,462 --> 01:07:21,064
Hmmm. Going to my room now.

844
01:08:19,898 --> 01:08:21,117
Hey dad...

845
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:22,851
Hey...

846
01:08:28,445 --> 01:08:30,202
Read me your script?

847
01:08:31,826 --> 01:08:33,570
Yeah, absolutely!

848
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,198
You know what...

849
01:08:39,562 --> 01:08:41,343
I got a better idea.

850
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:45,109
How about you show me your film,

851
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,648
I'll read you my script later.

852
01:08:49,152 --> 01:08:50,109
Deal.

853
01:08:50,194 --> 01:08:51,656
Ok, lets go.

854
01:09:28,517 --> 01:09:34,808
Huh, oh my gosh,
this is good, this is good.

855
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,562
You think it's this
easy to stroll in like this!?

856
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:39,943
Hey...

857
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:44,155
I was just about to
read her my script

858
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,820
if you wanted to join us?

859
01:09:46,106 --> 01:09:48,374
Don't act like
you're out of the woods yet!

860
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:54,343
At least I've landed.

861
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:42,816
He pants and
looks around the beach,

862
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,482
bits of wreckage
from his craft scatter

863
01:10:44,566 --> 01:10:46,878
the sand. Some
large, some small.

864
01:10:47,233 --> 01:10:50,066
Slowly calming, he looks
ahead and sees in front of him,

865
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:54,098
a tall mountain of
sand. He studies it,

866
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:57,191
then drops to his knees,
face whitening with desperation.

867
01:10:57,275 --> 01:11:01,487
He blinks and seems to be
clearly contemplating his situation.

868
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:05,783
He lifts his arm and starts hitting
a cracked touch pad on his wrist.

869
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:08,870
It finally comes
to life, sort of.

870
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,737
He speaks into it.

871
01:11:11,696 --> 01:11:12,847
Control...

872
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:16,128
do you read me Control?

873
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,714
Please send rescue.
