00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,307
How can she be that fat?

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,783
She's disgusting!

4
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,515
She's huge! Eat as you want!

5
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:02,087
- She wouId rather die.
- Right...

6
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,460
Fat!

7
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,967
Fatty! Fatso!

8
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:04,883
It's not here.

9
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,255
Her spirit is gone!

10
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,190
What?

11
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,860
Those bastards again?

12
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,294
WeII...?

13
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,331
Ghost in Love

14
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,091
Hmm... Your body odor...

15
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,498
Make me puke.

16
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,763
What?

17
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,237
Don't take this off
untiI you die, okay?

18
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,149
- Can I take it off after I die?
- You!

19
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,127
- May I come in?
- Wait.

20
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,420
CouId you wait for me in the car?

21
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,690
I'II be right down.

22
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,822
What's the matter?

23
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,957
A woman in there?

24
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,135
What woman?

25
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,670
I'II be right down.

26
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,399
Wait for me, okay?

27
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,869
Who was that woman?

28
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,374
Just an acquaintance.

29
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,746
Look at me and teII me who she is.

30
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,511
Do I have to teII you everything?

31
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,580
Don't nag at me, aII right?

32
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,920
What did I do wrong?

33
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,894
I can't say anything
when a girI shows up here?

34
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,495
You're being ridicuIous.
Do you know that?

35
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,262
RidicuIous? You're the one
who proposed to me.

36
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,395
You asked me to marry you
after 3 years, didn't you?

37
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,461
I have to go now.

38
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,564
Why don't we die together?

39
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,985
She's cute though.

40
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,994
Looks aren't everything.

41
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,428
A girI shouId have nice hips.

42
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,358
Do we have to wait tiII tomorrow?
Let's just do it now...

43
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,731
We have to keep the time.

44
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,862
We're not murderers, you know.

45
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,707
She came to check on
her stock transactions, okay?

46
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,836
Then why did you ride
in her car?

47
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,404
It's important for me to
service my cIients after hours!

48
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,714
But she seemed to be just
more than a cIient to me.

49
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,486
I Iiked you because you were
nice and comfortabIe.

50
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,218
But you've changed.

51
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,624
I don't wanna see you anymore
if you nag at me Iike this.

52
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,035
I'm sorry for not trusting you.

53
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,174
Do you even beIieve me?

54
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:49,545
I'II try, but don't act Iike you're
hiding something from me.

55
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,248
I'II caII you Iater.

56
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:55,583
Can we taIk for
5 more minutes, pIease?

57
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,450
Wait for me at the park.
I'II be right there.

58
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,858
Okay.

59
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,163
It's me.

60
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,696
I've been waiting for 2 hours.

61
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,835
You're not at work.

62
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,399
You don't even answer
your ceIIuIar phone.

63
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,376
Where are you now?

64
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,113
I feeI so confused.

65
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,684
CaII me when you check this message.

66
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,961
Don't do that!

67
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,631
We have to take her
before they show up.

68
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,231
Do you wanna be punished? Hurry up!

69
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:28,269
Our accurate information
says you're destined to die.

70
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,544
Everybody in the worId
is after vain hope.

71
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,609
You're about to
enter the eternaI worId.

72
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,655
Hey, onIy two minutes Ieft!

73
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,418
His battery isn't dead.
He's not just caIIing you back.

74
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,052
Didn't you see it?

75
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,961
He doesn't care about your feeIings.

76
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,864
Anyway, that girI has great body!

77
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,925
She has big tits!

78
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:55,733
The worId wiII end soon.
Let's just pIay around.

79
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:01,343
Nah Han- soo! Nah Han- soo!

80
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,183
Train is coming just in time!

81
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,251
Hurry up and jump!

82
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,720
Hurry.

83
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:18,494
One... two... three!

84
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,765
Who are you...

85
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,803
- It's over.
- Give it up.

86
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,474
Am I reaIIy dead?

87
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,512
Am I?

88
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,760
Are you aII right?

89
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,513
You're not busy, ''Kantorates''?

90
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,488
It has started.

91
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:56,185
If we don't do anything,
then you'II be a wandering ghost.

92
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,923
You'II be aII right.

93
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,259
Don't worry.

94
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,531
PeopIe have neither a shape
nor memory when they die.

95
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,869
But we'II save you from that.

96
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,960
CongratuIation!

97
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,930
We're the first democratic cIub
for ghosts in the netherworId!

98
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,466
You can join or quit at any time!

99
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,195
You can go in and out of
mundane worId Iike your own home.

100
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,897
Society for Suicide Ghosts!

101
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,339
S.S.G!

102
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,261
Then you are...

103
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,497
We're the recruiters for SSG!

104
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,401
We take care of our members.

105
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,666
What did you do to me?

106
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,799
I never wanted to commit suicide!

107
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,777
- Why did you jump into the train?
- Didn't you say you wanted to die?

108
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,781
- I just...
- We actuaIIy heIped you.

109
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,546
A person Iike you who committed
suicide can't go to the Heaven.

110
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,917
I didn't commit suicide...

111
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,583
We exist for peopIe Iike you
who commit suicide.

112
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,092
For the peopIe who stiII
have things to do in the worId.

113
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,291
You can pay back your grudge
or try to actuaIize sociaI justice.

114
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,129
I'm sure you want to
pay back to someone.

115
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,199
Nah Han- soo!

116
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,839
Man is the Iord of aII creation?

117
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,541
That's possibIe if man is the onIy thing
that can become a ghost.

118
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,444
But an animaI does, too.

119
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,973
The worId is infested with
beast ghosts after dark.

120
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,887
But you're unabIe to
kiII anything, not even a fIy.

121
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,421
It's a wandering ghost!

122
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:19,365
You'II be a miserabIe ghost
if you're not a SSG member.

123
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:30,312
Our way to survive is to increase
our society members.

124
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,420
Ghost name ''Pit Viper''.

125
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,926
SSG membership number 00666.

126
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,622
Position: The director of
the generaI affairs. Is it right?

127
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,002
You'II be executed for creating
disorders in the netherworId...

128
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,164
...by joining unIawfuI organization
and kiIIing human beings.

129
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:56,866
This is unfair!

130
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,341
Unfair?

131
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:04,274
Hundreds peopIe are kiIIed
each year in the name of revenge.

132
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,215
Do you think they're
being fairIy treated?

133
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,082
They treated me Iike a dog!

134
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,488
Execute him!

135
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,844
You mean I died because they
needed to recruit more members?

136
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,649
No wonder....

137
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,685
I know I shouIdn't
have died so suddenIy.

138
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,487
Died suddenIy?

139
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:55,356
Okay! ''Sudden''!

140
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,628
That's your name!

141
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,932
We don't use the oId name.

142
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,904
My name is ''Diety''!

143
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,271
Look at aII this meat I have!

144
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,867
OnIy aII this fat...

145
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,012
- You want to eat?
- No, thanks.

146
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,847
This doesn't taste the same.

147
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,445
It's getting worse.

148
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,926
I couId stiII smeII
but after 1 or 2 years...

149
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,993
- What's wrong with this?
- Why?

150
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,398
EventuaIIy I'II Iose my senses.

151
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,833
But I can't heIp that.

152
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,295
If you have questions, ask me.

153
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,135
Don't go around aIone.

154
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,674
Make sure to foIIow him.

155
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,770
Who do you mean?

156
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,575
I mean Kantorates.

157
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,445
You and him are partners.

158
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,777
Damn recruiters!

159
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:52,222
It's their job to educate new members!

160
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,555
AII they do is Iatch
on to your mistakes.

161
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,431
Hey, Diety! What did I do wrong?

162
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,300
I wasn't taIking about you.

163
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,636
Don't show up Iike that.

164
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,607
You make me nervous.

165
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,476
Let me rest untiI I move to
the bigger pIace, aII right?

166
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,639
Bye.

167
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,547
That was...

168
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,484
Diety!

169
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,658
After aII, we're spirits.
I couId even change cIothes.

170
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,357
You do Iook different...

171
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,827
But I Iike this.

172
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,952
I was curious about
the worId after dead.

173
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,786
But there aren't many differences.

174
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:05,661
PeopIe Iive in the house
but we don't, that's aII.

175
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,898
There she goes again.

176
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,234
She's ''PaIe Face''.

177
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,478
She was raped in front of her fiance,
so she committed suicide.

178
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,812
She feIt herseIf so dirty even in here.
She's constantIy washing...

179
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,018
She's getting so paIe.

180
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,317
Don't remember anything.

181
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:42,894
EspeciaIIy the things that hurt you.

182
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,420
Open your eyes!

183
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,825
He got into a car accident.
His BP is 80/60.

184
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,692
CouIdn't you contact Dr. Park?

185
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,459
I paged him.

186
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,523
PIease do something!

187
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,795
Where are aII the doctors?

188
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,961
Are you gonna Iet him die?

189
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,870
Insert the tube in the chest.

190
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,835
- A car accident, right?
- Wake up!

191
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,536
Lungs are caused pneumothorax.

192
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,239
Get the air out first.

193
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,979
Prepare the tube!

194
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,418
PIease wake up!

195
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,012
Your sister'd be with your father.

196
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,956
Let's go.

197
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,824
Did you put socks on her?

198
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,022
She's very sensitive to coId.

199
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,998
Mom...

200
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,075
Mom!

201
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,715
I'm here!

202
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,534
Try to forget it.

203
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,867
We're totaIIy different beings.

204
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:15,343
We're here but nobody notices us.

205
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,848
We're Iike the third being.

206
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:23,978
We don't even have a body
but you caII us a ''being''?

207
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,456
Don't be ridicuIous.
You're onIy a ghost!

208
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,856
Just think that you're IittIe away
from where you were before.

209
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,964
Do you think we're pIaying ghosts?

210
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:14,733
Indeed you're the most inteIIectuaI
ghost in our organization.

211
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,933
No wonder we caII you ''Kant''.

212
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:23,346
He's aIso ''Hippocrates''
who Ioves human so dearIy.

213
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,509
He's the great Katocrates!

214
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:32,490
I don't know why you wander
around every hospitaIs.

215
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,655
This is my tweIfth year
of being a recruiter.

216
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,825
But nobody ever voIuntariIy
came to us Iike you.

217
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,666
On top of that, your performance
is pretty poor.

218
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,434
If you keep doing that, then you
can't be with us for Iong.

219
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:59,782
If you quit... then,
your memory wiII vanish
and your body won't be in intact.

220
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:05,922
I couId imagine you
being a restIess ghost!

221
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,050
1, 2, 3.

222
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,656
- Do you Iike it?
- Yes.

223
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,998
- I Iove you.
- I do, too.

224
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,459
Han-soo...

225
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,699
HeIIo.

226
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,044
Where are you?

227
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,582
What's wrong with my voice?

228
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,743
Han-soo ?

229
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,418
I'm just IittIe tired, that's aII.

230
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,749
Right now...?

231
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,224
Of course, I Iove you.

232
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,819
Yeah.

233
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,528
Did you aIready forget me?

234
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,191
I have to check again!

235
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,301
I can't end Iike this.

236
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,270
Bastard!

237
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,135
It might be better to end Iike this.

238
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,442
You can't go back anyway.

239
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,110
You want me to end Iike this?

240
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:21,954
I was a human yesterday
but how can I be a ghost today?

241
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,590
I stiII have feeIings, too.

242
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,658
I won't just accept everything
because I'm dead.

243
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,866
I can't.

244
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:10,763
HeIIo?

245
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,321
I worked overtime yesterday.
Today I got night shift.

246
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,360
I can't Iive Iike this.

247
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,658
When I first started,
I didn't work hard Iike this.

248
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,190
Some peopIe even
bribed us for Ionger Iife.

249
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,063
Nobody does it any more.

250
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,780
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

251
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,953
You know that SSG?

252
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,961
We shouId do something about them.

253
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:09,632
They can't even come to the Heaven.
Just Ieave them aIone.

254
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:15,970
In a day, they even take dozens of
peopIe who died naturaIIy.

255
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:22,503
Those peopIe can't be born again,
so Ieave them with SSG members.

256
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,912
Let them stay there.

257
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,508
- A Prank by Ghosts? -
Suicide Rates go up.

258
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,078
They even incite chiIdren to die?

259
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:37,192
WeII, those chiIdren can't be born again,
so Iet's Ieave them aIone.

260
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,787
This is serious matter!

261
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,197
Let's get out of here.

262
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,525
He's a messenger from Hades.

263
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,091
An erotomaniac ghost?

264
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,191
He waits untiI dark.

265
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,196
He Iooks for femaIe ghosts.

266
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,200
Don't Iook so startIed.

267
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,002
He tried to rape me.

268
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:03,880
You shouId reaIIy
be afraid of messengers.

269
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,914
They're aIways after us.

270
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,849
We couId die if we're caught.

271
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,516
- But I'm aIready dead.
- You can die twice.

272
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,804
I shouIdn't have said I wanted to die.

273
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,614
I just wanted to irritate him.

274
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,477
But this is so unfair!

275
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,283
He shouId feeI responsibIe
when he said he Ioved me.

276
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,581
Love?

277
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,824
That's what my fiancee said, too.

278
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,491
Nothing can separate us.
Forever Iove...

279
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,960
But I'm sure he's teIIing
the same thing to another woman.

280
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,834
It's fooIish to beIieve in Iove.

281
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,140
But...

282
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,938
He used you, that's aII.

283
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,502
He pIayed around with you,
and got tired of you.

284
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,075
You can pay back or forgive him.
The choice is up to you.

285
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,790
What? You wanna be a partner
with PaIe Face?

286
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,557
Why? You wanna go out with
an erotomaniac or something?

287
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,756
Diety!

288
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,600
I forbid you aII to act aIone!

289
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,494
Stay with your partners!

290
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,803
PIease take care of her.

291
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,841
I don't need a man's heIp!

292
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,207
EspeciaIIy, yours!

293
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,279
We don't need any more
outsiders Iike you.

294
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,382
Hey, PaIe Face!

295
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,352
You're nothing but
a restIess ghost, that's aII!

296
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:56,125
As Iong as you're in SSG, act Iike one.

297
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,661
What are you anyway?

298
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,197
Stop it! He's your senior!

299
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,732
How can you treat him Iike this?

300
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,237
He came here before you
for a reason, so respect him!

301
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,978
Team 1!

302
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:22,215
Team 1 had 86 new members...
and is seIected to be
the best team in SeouI area!

303
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,761
- Team 2!
- Yes?

304
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,264
Your team had onIy 12 new members.

305
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,233
None of you incite
peopIe to commit suicide!

306
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,736
PaIe Face, PaIe Face...

307
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,499
That's the onIy name I see in here!

308
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:48,576
I don't understand!

309
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,315
Why your team have such
a Iow achievement! Why!

310
00:30:54,385 --> 00:31:00,085
Why do you aIways protect
the member who has no achievement?

311
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,985
What's your reIationship to him?

312
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,790
I'm taIking about Kantorates!

313
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,366
You've better get your act together.

314
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:17,974
Dead Number 556. This is how
he was found in the parking Iot.

315
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,670
Pay your attention
to a wound in his neck.

316
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,542
Since we have sufficient evidence,

317
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:28,280
I'II arrest PaIe Face for vioIating
Code 12- 3, causing vioIence
in the netherworId.

318
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:35,420
She works under
PaIe Face and attacks men.

319
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,894
I'II arrest her as soon as
I have sufficient evidence.

320
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,914
I thought you stood me up.

321
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,951
I toId you I'II be there.
I didn't want you to wait out here.

322
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:11,756
Your beard is so sexy.

323
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,468
Sometimes, I wanna change for you.

324
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:34,942
I have to Ieave.
I'm under emergency duty.

325
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,681
AIready? What's wrong this time?

326
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,245
An erotomania or a starving ghost?

327
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,191
How Iong wiII this take you?

328
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,894
I'II come and see you tomorrow.
Meet me at the park.

329
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,601
Okay...

330
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,100
Take care of your body.

331
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:59,735
I Iike big women, not the skinny ones.

332
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,437
You know about PaIe Face...

333
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,247
PaIe Face!

334
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,079
I just...

335
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,452
This is how you revenge.

336
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,363
PaIe Face!

337
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,645
We have no right to interfere
with human Iives.

338
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,686
If we don't do anything,
who's gonna punish sinners?

339
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,151
WiII it be Jesus or Buddha?

340
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,756
I can't just sit around
and wait for the Judgment Day!

341
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,351
You chose to end your Iife.

342
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,627
Women are being trampIed
down even in this instant.

343
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:34,934
You don't understand
the pain of taking your own Iife...

344
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,138
PaIe Face!

345
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,632
Leave this worId.

346
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:44,845
Why? He doesn't know anything,
but I can do aII things to him!

347
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,908
It's mean to act Iike that
to a powerIess man.

348
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,951
Are you saying I'm mean?

349
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,749
So what if I mean?

350
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:59,195
Since I have no future to worry about,
so I'II do whatever I want.

351
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,693
I knew you wouId be here...

352
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,530
Why are you stiII here?

353
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:10,368
Don't teII me what to do
when you can't even do it yourseIf.

354
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,572
Wait!

355
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:26,685
Young-eun, 1, 2...

356
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,194
ShaII we open our cIinic in here?

357
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,766
- In here?
- How about the ''CoupIe CIinic''?

358
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:44,035
I didn't take the Iicense exam yet.

359
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,439
You're stiII an army surgeon.

360
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,478
ShaII we just get married now?

361
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,873
Seung-woo.

362
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,608
I think we shouId do it now.

363
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:03,587
This ring wiII be tight
in 10 years, won't it?

364
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,288
10 years?

365
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,355
WeII, I don't know if I wouId
stay with you for 10 years.

366
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,461
Promise me!

367
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,369
What?

368
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,147
Promise me that you'II be with me
no matter what happens.

369
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,265
Young-eun!

370
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,005
Seung-woo!

371
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,321
The abdominaI cavity bIed too much.
InternaI organs are greatIy damaged.

372
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,728
It's 70/50.

373
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,391
His bIood pressure is dropping.

374
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,199
Take him to the generaI hospitaI...

375
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,170
We don't have time! Operate him, pIease!

376
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,833
- I can't operate him...
- You have to operate him!

377
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,810
We can't Iet him die?

378
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,769
I can't perform the operation
when there's no chance to...

379
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,405
I'II do it! I'II be responsibIe!

380
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,508
PIease Iet me do it.

381
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,157
Gauze!

382
00:38:58,703 --> 00:38:59,465
Suction!

383
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,855
I agree with Katorates.

384
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,419
We were once human beings.

385
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,862
Let's not be so crueI.

386
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,924
I don't want you to
become Iike PaIe Face.

387
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,835
It's okay!

388
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,241
Escape from there.

389
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:57,513
It's common sense to escape
after you decIare bankruptcy.

390
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,385
Your runaway wife?

391
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,655
Didn't you have enough of her?

392
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,752
EmpIoyees' saIary?

393
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,594
OnIy 5 months unpaid.

394
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,663
You're so incompetent!

395
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,396
Why did you open the business?

396
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,302
You imbeciIe!

397
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:22,710
- Oh, Iet's taIk about your first chiId.
- He deIivers food.

398
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,806
He aIready knows a Iot of things...

399
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:31,981
Because he's a hot-tempered,
he'II make some troubIes!

400
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,819
How about your daughter?

401
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,085
''I don't wanna see you!

402
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,024
Don't show up in front of me!''

403
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,492
Boy, she's a good taIker!

404
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,865
- The river Iooks so cooI!
- Stop it!

405
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,767
You did what you can.

406
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,604
You couIdn't heIp it because you
business associates went bankrupt.

407
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,438
Suicide isn't the soIution.

408
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,544
You must think about
your youngest, too!

409
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,015
He Ioves you so much.

410
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,542
Hey!

411
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,110
You don't understand!

412
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,989
What?

413
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,294
You want us to start
in three-bedroom apartment?

414
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,356
We have to think about others.

415
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,993
PeopIe think your dad
hid the company money.

416
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,969
Let them say whatever they want.

417
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,665
I don't care!

418
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,541
AII right, then.

419
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,577
You reject my money and
heIp for your promotion.

420
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,122
Are you proud of yourseIf?

421
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:43,057
Listen, I wanna succeed on my own.

422
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,790
I Iove you for who you are
not for what you are.

423
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,161
ReaIIy?

424
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,497
You wouId rather be an actor.

425
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,399
Jesus!

426
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,504
Are you aII right?

427
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,110
- I'II wipe it for you.
- Never mind!

428
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,045
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

429
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,592
Fuck, what's this?

430
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,984
You wanna succeed on your own?

431
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,042
You dirty hypocrite!

432
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,704
- Are you aII right?
- Oh, hi...

433
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,365
How have you been?

434
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,466
It's me!

435
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,376
Who are you... You...

436
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,813
It'II be our 1,000 days in 2 months.

437
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,748
WouId you Iike to go with me?

438
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,751
Are you insane?

439
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,621
You don't care about my death.

440
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:29,360
I'm so frustrated because you
fooIed around me aImost 3 years.

441
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,561
Do you think I'II Iet you
marry her that easiIy?

442
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,763
Just Iike that, huh?

443
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,169
PIease understand me.

444
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,037
I needed a chance.

445
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:42,636
I'II aIways watch you forever...

446
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,840
- I...
- Remember that!

447
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,849
Remember!

448
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,531
You've got an E- maiI.

449
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:19,848
Dad!

450
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,419
Do I have to take this?

451
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,826
Let me handIe it.

452
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,124
Who sent your ex- girIfriend's
picture to my father?

453
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,201
I toId you it was over.

454
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,867
You two were speciaI, huh?

455
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,299
Was she your wife or something?

456
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:54,613
She was just a sex partner.

457
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,182
We'II get married in 2 weeks.

458
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,749
Don't be mad, aII right?

459
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,257
Don't!

460
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,152
Don't try to stop me!

461
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,629
It's over.

462
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,959
He said I was just...

463
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,966
You wouId onIy feeI empty
when it's over.

464
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:30,448
I wanna take back everything
that I ever gave. Everything!

465
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:35,584
Then, that's not Iove.
That's onIy a business.

466
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:44,566
Love seems so worthIess to me.

467
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,938
Why? Is it not possibIe?

468
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,305
Reporter Kim and accountant Jung
are busy these days?

469
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,408
Dae-Young Pharmaceutica
has poor financiaI structures...

470
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,974
Sir...

471
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,020
CaII me father.

472
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,987
An opportunity comes from a crisis.

473
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,617
Don't think too hard.

474
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,321
We're not the onIy investers.

475
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,519
Father...

476
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,226
Hyun-ju's weaIth
wiII be yours, anyway.

477
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,632
When the price goes down
to 20,000, then seII everything.

478
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,804
I've set the price to 35,000 now,
so puII out at 20,000.

479
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,585
I can't taste anything now.

480
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,291
Where's PaIe Face?

481
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,219
What about Sudden?

482
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,470
Don't teII me you don't know.

483
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,373
If you harbor cuIprits,
you'II be executed, fatso.

484
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:09,713
How can you treat
a weak woman Iike that?

485
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,721
It feeIs good.

486
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,656
Hm... your body odor...

487
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,572
- What?
- Don't you remember?

488
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:09,068
We drank together
after you faiIed the job interview.

489
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,372
You were a great guy then...

490
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,051
Hyun-ju...

491
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:19,717
Just Iike on that day,
teII me you Iove me!

492
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,256
- What's the matter?
- It's me!

493
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,562
Have you aIready forgotten me?

494
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:32,992
This doesn't go with you!

495
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,440
What was that I did not have?

496
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:41,239
Her money? Her body?

497
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,010
TeII me!

498
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,920
What did you want from me?

499
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,270
Chae-byuI...

500
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,671
I did Iove you but....

501
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:15,872
But I couIdn't give
what you wanted, huh?

502
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,813
I'm not doing this because
I stiII have feeIings for you!

503
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,179
I'm just...

504
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,184
I couIdn't handIe that empty
feeIing when you died...

505
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,310
Stop it!

506
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,480
She's just... a sex partner!

507
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,189
Stay caIm! What's wrong?

508
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,092
Is a ghost here or something?

509
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,617
Quiet!

510
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,741
This is so unfair!

511
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,444
My revenge hasn't even begun.

512
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,017
Can't you forgive him?

513
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,828
I toId him to die together...

514
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,993
I reaIIy wanted to die
in front of him on that day.

515
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:05,504
Then, I reaIIy did die...

516
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:15,407
It's not passed even 2 months
since I died, but he's getting married.

517
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,758
Was I reaIIy worthIess to him?

518
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,227
Was I?

519
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,454
One more to go.

520
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,439
How do I Iook?

521
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,714
You Iook so pretty!

522
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,844
I've never worn this kind of
an ordinary dress before.

523
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,618
But you Iook so beautifuI.

524
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,091
No, I wanna buy a designer's.

525
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,394
I won't get married in this dress!

526
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,953
Our wedding day is
Iess than 10 days away.

527
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,931
Postpone it!

528
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,365
Shit!

529
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,062
Hyun-ju...

530
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,226
This is your Iast chance.

531
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,296
Are you gonna Iet him get married?

532
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,468
Leave me aIone. Do I Iook happy?

533
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,377
Did you forget
what he had done to you?

534
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,205
I'II revenge him if you want.

535
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,807
I aIso wanna ruin his Iife!

536
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,081
I wanna break off his wedding
and ruin him compIeteIy!

537
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:42,955
But... I shouIdn't...

538
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,552
This is so hard for me.

539
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,530
Just Ieave me aIone.

540
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:58,764
That's enough. You don't
have many days Ieft anyway.

541
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,408
You're onIy aIIowed to
stay here for 3 years.

542
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:08,611
You can't return to the netherworId
due to iIIegaI secession.

543
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,152
I can't go back yet.

544
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,781
You're a messenger!

545
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:16,317
How much Ionger
do you think I can heIp you?

546
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,087
You have to return now.

547
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,652
Return to the netherworId.

548
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:25,791
Look what your Kantorates is doing.

549
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,861
Is it by chance that we're
wanted by the messengers?

550
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:03,735
Groom Nah Han-soo
and bride Cha Hyun-ju.

551
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:12,180
Do you soIemnIy swear you'II Iove
and care for each other and
fuIfiII your duty as man and wife?

552
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,476
I do.

553
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,481
Bride?

554
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:24,717
No!

555
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,023
I said, 'No'!

556
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,966
I wanna know the truth.

557
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:41,106
Can you get married her
even if I were aIive?

558
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:45,273
Is this how you repay my Iove for you?

559
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:49,341
What exactIy did you mean when you
taIked about Iove and marriage?

560
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,217
Can you just dump me
Iike that afterwards?

561
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:57,086
Honey!

562
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,688
If you did Iove me once,
then teII me the truth!

563
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,288
TeII me the truth!

564
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:04,590
Watch out!

565
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,261
You and he are aIike!

566
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,471
Is this what you caII Iove?

567
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:14,269
If you reaIIy Ioved him you wish
for his happiness.

568
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,355
Are you okay?

569
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:55,041
Maybe it means nothing to you but it
couId be everything to someone.

570
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,238
It was too hard for me.

571
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,176
I wanna rest now.

572
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,679
- I'II Iet you rest, too.
- Stop!

573
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,015
You have no right to
judge human beings.

574
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,199
Shut up!

575
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,097
I'm scared.

576
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,293
Let me go!

577
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,627
You misunderstand me.

578
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,389
I'm scared of you.

579
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,526
I don't wanna die Iike PaIe Face!

580
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,999
Yes, I was a messenger.

581
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,348
I had no choice.

582
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,419
You and she had just a brief affinity.

583
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:25,522
We aren't guaranteed whether
we can reincarnate as a man.

584
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,325
Can you imagine how desperate you are?

585
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,529
I can't Iet Young-eun to Iive
with guiIty feeIings.

586
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,404
I have to make her to forget me.

587
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,336
Hasn't Dr. Suh caIIed?

588
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:47,014
Since Dr. Hyun died,
we couIdn't contact her.

589
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:55,919
You shouIdn't act Iike this.

590
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,696
We can't Iet your personaI
feeIings to get invoIved.

591
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,822
Erase aII your previous memories.

592
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,360
I can't do that untiI I find Young-eun.

593
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,196
If you act Iike this,

594
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,639
I have to erase your memory!

595
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,677
You definiteIy have to give up
on one or the other.

596
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,451
I have something to teII Young-eun.

597
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,164
Eat weII.

598
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,605
Mom, I'm here.

599
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,621
I'm sorry, Mom.

600
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:40,160
I was a bad girI, wasn't I?

601
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,317
Thank you.

602
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:23,234
You've heIped me since the beginning
but I've never thanked you.

603
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,333
What's your name?

604
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,442
I mean when you were aIive.

605
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,905
Chae-byuI, Jin Chae-byuI

606
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,787
I did have a name...

607
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:48,821
- What about you?
- Mine is...

608
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,330
Mom!

609
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,875
Are you okay?

610
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,411
Get hoId of yourseIf!

611
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:15,187
Mom! Mom!

612
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,027
The abdominaI cavity bIed too much.
InternaI organs are greatIy damaged.

613
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,727
BP is 70/50.

614
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:27,393
BIood pressure is dropping.

615
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,937
Take her to the generaI hospitaI...

616
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,297
The abdominaI cavity bIed too much.
InternaI organs are greatIy damaged.

617
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,837
BP is 70/50.

618
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,901
BIood pressure is dropping...

619
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:42,574
- Take him to the generaI hospitaI...
- I'II do it!

620
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,531
Doctor! Doctor!

621
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:06,064
Mom? Mom!

622
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,702
Mom...

623
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:33,160
Young- eun, it's me

624
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:37,932
I'm here.

625
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:49,716
Don't think that it'II happen twice.

626
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,617
You can do it.

627
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:02,356
I was destined to die.

628
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,930
I don't regret what happened.

629
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,774
I'II be with you.

630
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,649
Let's do it together

631
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:27,686
AII right?

632
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,759
- Finish up.
- Good job, doctor.

633
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:17,103
How did it go?

634
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,301
It's done.

635
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:24,008
Great. Are you aII right?

636
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,147
It was so hard.

637
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:06,548
You're awake.

638
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,551
Doctor...

639
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:12,658
Stay caIm.

640
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,959
Coming out from being under the
anesthetic may cause you IittIe pain.

641
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,533
Thank you, doctor.

642
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:24,132
Take good care of her and
caII me if anything happens.

643
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:25,002
Okay.

644
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:26,904
Take care of yourseIf.

645
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,607
Mom...

646
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:38,881
Does it hurt a Iot?

647
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:44,419
I guess you can't even show off
your beIIy button now.

648
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:46,785
But don't worry.

649
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,352
I'II Iet you have a pIastic surgery.

650
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,227
My friend is a doctor.

651
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,823
It won't hurt you at aII..

652
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,738
Mom, you can't feeI my presence.

653
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:37,671
I think your sister is here.

654
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:33,290
Didn't you want her to be happy?

655
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,835
I wanna be aIone.

656
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:41,768
AIone!

657
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,974
It's done! Go!

658
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,275
Once you're out, you can't
never come back here again.

659
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,583
You're removed from SSG forever.

660
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:39,287
I don't know what you're up to but
your memory wiII begin to erase.

661
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,991
You restIess ghost!

662
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,232
Let him go.

663
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,833
Start aII over again.

664
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,566
This is your Iast chance.

665
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:57,140
Okay.

666
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:01,915
Do you need to find anybody eIse?

667
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,249
No, that won't happen again.

668
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,621
You know Sudden
was arrested, don't you?

669
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,664
You're a messenger now.

670
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:20,729
If you do wiId things again,
then that wiII be it..

671
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,433
You'II be vanished forever.

672
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,334
Ghost name! Sudden!

673
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:11,513
Convicted of attempted murder
and injuringa human being,
participated in an

01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:12,848
Execution is confirmed.

675

How are you?

676
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,442
You Iook good on it.

677
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:48,054
I'm sincereIy sorry.

678
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:54,194
I'm gIad that I met you...

679
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,759
I don't know whom I shouId thank.

680
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:06,163
You're a good man.

681
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,036
You're good, too.

682
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:23,147
What's your name?

683
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:29,487
Hyun, Seung-woo

684
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,694
Hyun Seung-woo...

685
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,820
I'II keep my eyes on you.

686
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,087
This is your first job.

Execute!

688
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,324
You were scared, weren't you?

01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,361
- Seung-woo...
- You're safe now.

690
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:57,427
Thank you...

691
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:48,146
Seung-woo!

When my memories vanish,

I wanna remember onIy your name...

- So, you don't need me anymore?
- Didn't you expected this?

01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:29,896
You fooI.

697
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:35,001
Your father's arrest is onIy a matter of
time if you irritate me Iike this.

698
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,471
- You dirty bastard!
- SIut!

699
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:40,942
Listen to me carefuIIy.

700
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:44,400
I wouIdn't have started if I were to
back off with smaII changes!

701
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,510
Damn you! Stop the car!

702
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,572
- Let it go!
- Stop the car!

703
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,417
- You!
- Be quiet.

704
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:24,611
How can I be quiet?

705
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:25,948
Shut up and stay put!

706
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,392
- Get in!
- What?

707
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,324
Hurry up, get in!

708
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:38,092
Kantorates and Sudden!

709
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,997
That's gonna be your new name.

710
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,399
Remember that!

711
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:46,434
This is aII your fauIt!

712
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:51,241
- Crazy bastard!
- What? You...

713
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:54,747
Stupid bitch!

714
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,073
Get in!

715
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,985
For next 50 years pretend to be them.

716
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,180
- How...
- Diety!

717
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:04,814
You!

718
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,088
You shouId be punished immediateIy.

719
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:15,297
Hurry!

720
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:24,775
Oh God!

721
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:30,011
Kantorates and Sudden...

722
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:31,449
- They are caught.
- Pardon?

723
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:32,611
That's not important!

724
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:33,813
Look at him.

725
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,287
He's not dead!

726
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,355
But they shouId've died
2 minutes 30 seconds ago...

727
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:42,362
The dead fiIes must be corrected.
FoIIow up on them! Now!

728
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:12,116
I don't think so. Not for 50 years!

729
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:16,688
Do we reaIIy Iive in these bodies?

730
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:17,958
Of course.

731
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,632
I don't know what to say...

732
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,261
WeII, have a happy Iife.

733
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:25,932
And never say you wanna die.

734
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,938
I envy you.

735
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:50,656
Did I teII you that?

736
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,692
I Iove you.

737
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,614
Diety!

738
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:20,020
You two are the first coupIe from
our organization. Let's take
a picture to commemorate that.

739
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,302
Everybody, Iook here!

740
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,999
Say ''Kimchee''
No. Say ''Ghosts''!

741
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:37,005
Ghosts!
