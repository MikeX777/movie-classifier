1
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,665
Your eclairs, Mr. Ferrand.

2
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:23,559
-How many times do I have to tell you:
I'm not Mr. Ferrand!

3
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,020
-Why ? -because Mr. Ferrand is dead.

4
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,652
He no longer eats cakes. -OK, Mr. Ferrand.

5
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,640
Good-bye, Mr. Ferrand.

6
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:45,573
-So you told me that you are newcomer?

7
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:48,455
Yes, I just got appointed as a college supervisor.

8
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm not from here, I'm from Brest,
on the other side of France.

9
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,299
- I am not from here either.
-Oh no ?

10
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:57,381
-I was born here. -Right here ?

11
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:02,794
-Yes, down here on the other side of the earth, Australia.

12
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:08,016
Little compatriots. -Hello my dear.

13
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:10,669
Do not bother. Blanche is up there?

14
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,351
-She is out. She had urgent errands.

15
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,751
-But she knew I was coming!
-Oh, women!

16
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:21,953
The temptation of stores!
It's really not nice.

17
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:25,395
Tell her I'll call at dinner time.

18
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:27,796
Do not forget.
-I'll do it for sure.

19
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:29,617
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

20
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:32,777
So, do you want them?

21
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:35,901
- I'm hesitant.
-I understand.

22
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:39,526
I hate birds, they are messy and noisy.

23
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:42,420
-Noisy ? -It's true,
I have no musical culture.

24
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:45,923
It's a whim of my niece.

25
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,366
Before, we only sold vegetable seeds here.

26
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,687
I'll take the little one.
She looks more lively.

27
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,985
-I'm afraid that is not possible. Wait.

28
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,694
Blanche !

29
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:03,484
Blanche, would you come down?

30
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,335
- One moment, I'm coming!

31
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,216
-What do you want sir?

32
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
What do you want sir?

33
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,189
-I would have wanted. Which means..
I would have liked...

34
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,244
I would like...

35
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,896
- Sir would like to take one of the birds.

36
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:55,853
-These? Ah! I'm sorry sir, but it's impossible.

37
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:59,383
It is a species that can only live in pairs.

38
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,558
If we separate them, they die.

39
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,443
-Well, then, I'll take both.
-Very well.

40
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:10,025
They are very cautious, give them lots of sun.

41
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,248
I am always a little sad when I part with my birds.

42
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,545
-I am sorry.

43
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:23,485
It's 100 Francs.

44
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,312
-Oh sorry.

45
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:29,231
Thank you.

46
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,747
Excuse me madam. -Yes.

47
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,425
Sir ! Your birds.

48
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:53,900
So it's over with the deputy mayor?

49
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:57,677
What exactly happened?
-He doesn't like the phone.

50
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:03,036
-As soon as the phone rings here, it turns white.
It turns out that it's his wife.

51
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:04,695
-Put yourself in his shoes.

52
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:07,935
- This is all ridiculous. I'm tired of this little town

53
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:11,822
..of this petty life, this furniture, this store ...

54
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:16,711
-And the consul? The store is our facade,
don't forget that.

55
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,036
-Ah ! Facade, facade !

56
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,968
- We must keep up appearances.

57
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,466
If you sell the store, you lose the consul.

58
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,097
After 2 years of patience,
it would be too stupid to spoil everything on a whim.

59
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:35,160
-I can't take it anymore, I'm suffocating here.

60
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,884
I understand, of course. But think about what it means.

61
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:45,001
... The wealth! Definitive security!

62
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:47,835
Where are you going?

63
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,933
You're leaving?
-Yes, I'm going to get some fresh air.

64
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,907
- Get up, Snowy! Stand up !

65
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:02,303
- Can't you see it's over?

66
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,368
-He's finished !

67
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:20,946
-René Ribeau,

68
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,278
..winner by KO.

69
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,393
-So my little guy?

70
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:41,166
-He's well sounded. -I told you so.

71
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:43,885
Your Snowy is not serious. He trains in daisies.

72
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:47,267
- I send him my condolences. Save my place, Martin.

73
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:13,377
-Dupuy, defend our colors! -Do not worry.

74
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,342
-Well, aim at the corner of the stairs.

75
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,248
-It's not for us.

76
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:26,920
-Mlle, in the 3rd row there is a place,
if that's what you're looking for.

77
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:28,207
-Thank you.

78
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:32,501
-I was sure of it.
I saw him box when they saw those from Breteuil.

79
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,725
-Is the place vacant?
-No...

80
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,564
But you can still sit down.

81
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,847
-Great fight, in 6 times.

82
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:44,715
..of 3 min, between Joseph Redeuil
of the Laval Boxing Club, 65 kg,

83
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:48,505
..and Etienne Dupuy from
the Clairval ring, 66 kg 200.

84
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:52,121
Joseph Redeuil!

85
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,350
-Etienne Dupuy.

86
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:01,039
-Did you lose something?
-A four leaf clover.

87
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,499
-What ?
-The 4 leaf clover in silver.

88
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:07,947
Here it is !

89
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:12,202
It's pretty, but it's a shame it's in silver.

90
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,230
-Why ?

91
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:16,786
-Because they say that money does not buy happiness.

92
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,532
-The pin doesn't want to hold.

93
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:31,195
What is happiness ?

94
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:34,361
As long as you stay here, I could answer you.

95
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,787
-The Dupuy guy is in good shape.
-Yes, but Redeuil is mean.

96
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:49,061
-Bad ! But the other one is boxing

97
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:54,362
Do you like boxing, Miss?
-I do not know yet.

98
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:57,380
-Is this the first time you've come?
-Yes.

99
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,682
- Did you see the footwork?

100
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,886
-Go on!
-Go on Dupuy!

101
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:29,952
-Come on Dupuy boy!

102
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:34,871
Did you see how beautiful that is?
Look what your Redeuil takes!

103
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:35,927
Go on !

104
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,596
-Have you seen what your Redeuil needs to correct?

105
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:46,051
-It's not over.
-Yes.

106
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:49,250
What do you think ?
I'm not saying anything.

107
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,873
- Come on Dupuy, what are you waiting for?

108
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,968
You go!

109
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:10,338
Well done. Go on !

110
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,616
Get up! Get up!

111
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,093
-Six, seven, eight ...

112
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,796
-It's disgusting, it's butchery!

113
00:12:57,117 --> 00:13:01,000
-From the butcher's shop!
If you don't like it, go to Marie's children.

114
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:03,910
It's true ! He's never been to boxing.

115
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:10,907
- Can I take my place again?
-If you want.

116
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:19,475
-Martin! I looked for you everywhere. Where have you been?
I don't see you anymore.

117
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,990
What have I done to you?
-it's only a month.  I'm going..

118
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:21,990


119
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:26,986
-What's got Martin?

120
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,544
-I dunno. You ask me that. I do not know anything !

121
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:39,657
-Hey! Good evening Roumagnac.

122
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,098
-Good evening M. Ribot.
-I'm not the only one late.

123
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,076
I must see you tomorrow for this contract award.

124
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,883
-Yes. - Meet at the cafe, 11 a.m.

125
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:52,249
-Okay. Good evening, M. Ribot.

126
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,479
-Good evening Mr. Ladjouan.

127
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:59,175
-So, the bird flew away? -Yes, she left a feather.

128
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:01,423
-Oh, a four-leaf clover!

129
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:06,059
-Oh Paulot! Oh!

130
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,565
Do you need me anymore?
-No.

131
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:12,266
-I'm going to Clairval to see Ribot for the hospice.

132
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:13,325
-Okay.

133
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:21,462
Say, it's nice! - Come on, I'm happy

134
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,571
When I built my first house, I was not proud.

135
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,333
-A rabbit hut. -Yes.

136
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:28,990
-It seemed like the town hall. -Oh there !

137
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:31,702
-You've made progress.
-Yes, thanks to you.

138
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,269
Without you, I would still be an associate
I'll give you the money.

139
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,795
-There is nothing urgent. We'll settle this as usual.

140
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:42,915
Whether my money is with you or in the bank,
it's the same. Bye.

141
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:46,066
-Goodbye see you soon.
-Goodbye, old man.

142
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,702
-Hey ! -Eh ?

143
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,433
-I'm doing something that you like.

144
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:57,593
-Yes? - Tripe.

145
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,763
- Have you put my shoes away?
I get off at Clairval.

146
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:03,476
I have an appointment with the deputy mayor.

147
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:10,548
I put them out to dry last night, they were muddy.

148
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,642
Well then!

149
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:18,190
-What time do you come home for lunch ?
Is it convenient to cook for you ?

150
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:22,081
-Do not worry about the tripe, it's better reheated.

151
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:25,066
What did I do with my shoes?

152
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:28,304
-Look under the buffet. -
Ah!

153
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:35,305
Oh ! Bravo for the polish!
You're not just my sister...

154
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,844
... you're a real priestess.
-In any case, you're my purgatory on earth.

155
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,951
You go to Clairval, take mustard.

156
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:43,730
-Okay.

157
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:49,671
- In short, the kid presents himself well.
The plans are satisfactory.

158
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:52,741
Satisfied Bonnemain ?
Give it to me.

159
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:54,638
Your quotes are reasonable.

160
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:58,279
-I can do it for less, but there is much work and materials.

161
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,001
I do not agree with your architect.

162
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:04,934
-Why?
-Look at your windows.

163
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:08,464
Real skylights!
It's not because old people see nothing,

164
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:12,212
..that we must not give them light!

165
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,275
Here, the 4 leaf clover!

166
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,352
Excuse me.

167
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:25,630
Miss !

168
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:30,666
You went to the village hall.
-Yes, last night ...

169
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:33,755
-I had the pleasure of finding your four-leaf clover.

170
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:37,582
-Oh thank you. I was very keen on it.
What a pleasure, that gives me!

171
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:41,452
- It would make me happy if you have a drink with us.

172
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:43,745
-Gladly.
-allow me?

173
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,920
Mr. Ribot, Miss ...

174
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:01,330
-Mr. Ribot could introduce us.

175
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,646
-You know each other ?
-You don't know each other?

176
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,856
-Yes and no. -Martin Roumagnac,

177
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:10,231
..building contractor, Mme Blanche Ferrand.

178
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:16,312
- What are you having? It seems they have a good port,

179
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,585
..i prefer the Pernod.
-A Pernod.

180
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:23,719
Oh, Bonnemain!
Another Pernod here!

181
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,811
-We met yesterday at the boxing.

182
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,871
- Oh! do you like boxing?
-No.

183
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:31,987
The evenings are so long in the provinces.

184
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,205
Loneliness!
-Yes, I understand.

185
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,323
Here is my wife.

186
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:45,391
-A little port, Mrs.?
-I never drink.

187
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:48,243
We're going to be late for the DA.

188
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,640
The meeting is at noon.
- I know what I'm talking about. Hurry up!

189
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:55,513
Goodbye M. Roumagnac.
-Goodbye ma'am.

190
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,956
-Excuse us.

191
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:02,690
-If you like the company of happy widows,

192
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,653
... at least have the modesty not to go to the cafe.

193
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:09,065
-The deputy hasn't finished his drink.
He must still have liver trouble.

194
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:14,265
Are you going to build this hospice?
-Yes.

195
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:17,785
We'll save you a bed for when you go bankrupt.

196
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,857
What a joker!

197
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:24,551
-Well, I am beautiful!
- Forcibly by bike.

198
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:27,659
Do you live far away?
-At the other end of town.

199
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:30,495
I run a bird store with my uncle.

200
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:34,193
- I didn't see you running a business.
Are you a foreigner?

201
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:38,743
-No, I was born in Australia. -It is far.
Have you been here since?

202
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,496
-Three years.
-Three years !

203
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:44,185
It took 3 years for me to meet you.
3 years and a 4 leaf clover.

204
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:47,311
.. When I leave the site,

205
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,459
... it's not for going to bird shops.

206
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,943
-Don't you like birds?
-Ah yes, but ...

207
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,924
In the trees like fruit.
I like natural things.

208
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,575
-That's true.
-I'm not complicated.

209
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:03,524
I think life is good, don't you?

210
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:06,762
-Yes, but ...
I find people sad.

211
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:10,710
-Oh, the point is that sometimes!
Often they don't know what do with their 10 fingers.

212
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,304
I have my hands. With my bricks,

213
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:18,546
..I'm happy as a kid. You know, a stone is beautiful,

214
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:21,553
..a beautiful stone.
-Yes I understand you.

215
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:26,217
-We say it's cold, hard,
but it's soft, it's hot.

216
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:29,551
-And it gets better with age.
-To say that,

217
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:32,034
..you have a house in the countryside.

218
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:33,712
-No.
-You should.

219
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,398
- I do not intend to settle in this country.

220
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,971
-You want to go ?
There is nothing more beautiful than here.

221
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:44,030
There are amazing places around here.
-Yes I know.

222
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,311
- I have to go home, they are expecting me for lunch.

223
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,614
-Already ? Can I accompany you a bit?

224
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:51,787
-Yes.

225
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,694
-Hey, I'm leaving the money here.

226
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:13,317
I would be happy to build you a pretty villa with a beautiful view.

227
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:17,195
-From our house in Australia, we could see the hills.

228
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,299
There was a pond surrounded by trees, it was pretty.

229
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:23,854
-In France too, we have ponds. I know a beautiful area.

230
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:26,472
If you saw it ...
-Really?

231
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:29,921
-Yes, it's nearby. 15 minutes by car.

232
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:33,171
Shall we go after lunch?
-I have a store.

233
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:36,723
-It is a landscape to worship.  Let's go ?

234
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:40,784
- Can't it wait another day? The landscape will not fly away.

235
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:45,187
-Well, shall I pick you up Sunday, 2pm at your place?

236
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,576
-I can't resist you... So, see you on Sunday.

237
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,728
-Then goodbye and thank you again for the clover.

238
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:58,889
- Be careful. Don't forget Sunday!

239
00:20:59,066 --> 00:20:59,857
-No.

240
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,410
-What are you looking for ?

241
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:14,069
-A clover. It only has 3 leaves.
-We do what we can.

242
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,952
So this villa? Indulge.

243
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,837
-I have no sense of ownership.

244
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:23,039
-It comes by possessing, like appetite by eating.

245
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:26,793
-It's hot. -Terrible.
Take off my jacket.

246
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,719
- If we sit in the shade there? -
Yes.

247
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:38,554
-You who don't like caged birds,

248
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,728
-a house is also some kind of cage?

249
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:45,096
-No, a cage is when you don't have the key, like a prison,

250
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,585
..a barracks, a school.

251
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:52,497
The funny thing is, I don't have a house. I do not have the time..

252
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,319
.. to build one for me. By building it for others,

253
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:58,589
I imagine that they are mine.
-Look.

254
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:00,899
Looks like a nest up there.

255
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:03,966
Yes, it is indeed a nest.

256
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,447
There, look, on the last branch.

257
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:16,692
-Oh yes. Oh, it's been a long time since there's been a tenant.

258
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,292
This is a titpecker's nest.

259
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,859
-We breathe badly, even in the shade.

260
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:33,790
-It's the storm.

261
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,954
-Yes, it's coming fast.

262
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:40,665
-Yes and it comes up quickly.

263
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:43,533
-It would be wise to go.

264
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,041
- You are right, it would be wiser.

265
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,013
-Let's go quickly to the car.

266
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:52,520
-It is better to take shelter in the barn.

267
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,116
Let's hurry.

268
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,066
- You made me run. I am not used to it.

269
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:15,097
You are trained.

270
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,598
Provided that this storm does not last too long.

271
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,489
At what time will that bring us home?

272
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:27,593
No, because ... There already, it must be at least ...

273
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:53,718
-It did not rain.

274
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:55,837
-No, it's moved away.

275
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:18,833
Jean ! -
Yes.

276
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:22,337
-When you're done, you'll go there.
-Good.

277
00:24:33,624 --> 00:24:37,747
- Guys, get up to speed. We may sink soon.

278
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:40,032
-Hello.

279
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,451
-Oh !

280
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:44,391
-Hello.

281
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:49,085
-Wow ! How did you get here?
-By the bus. Am I bothering you ?

282
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:51,613
-Not at all, but I'm not presentable.

283
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:54,477
-It's a huge job.
I don't do all the work.

284
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:58,388
I am a subcontractor.
Since you're here, I'll show you the plans for your villa?

285
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,639
You really want to build me one?

286
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,806
-Come and see.

287
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,725
- She's the bird seller. The client for the villa.

288
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,609
Oh yes ? Martin is not thinking of anything else.

289
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:27,666
However, this villa is not Chartres Cathedral!
Thank you.

290
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,396
-I'm going back to work now.
-Not yet, stay a little.

291
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:47,016
I hardly see you anymore.
I'll end up being jealous of the villa.

292
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:48,246
-Why ?

293
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,737
-I waited for you again last night.
-Do not blame me.

294
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,349
I work late. Look, your house is progressing. Tomorrow

295
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:58,175
..I demolished the loft.
-Why ?

296
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,623
-It doesn't match the villa.
-Oh ! That's a shame !

297
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:04,609
-There's more space inside.

298
00:26:04,953 --> 00:26:05,780
-Let me see.

299
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:13,509
Oh, there is a bed. Someone is sleeping there,
probably a vagabond.

300
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:17,079
Hey! Be polite, darling! That vagabond is me.

301
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:19,580
-You ?
-Yes because...

302
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:23,375
In the evening when all the guys are gone I like to stay and

303
00:26:23,797 --> 00:26:27,025
..work myself at the villa. When it's too late

304
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,808
..I'm sleeping there.
So ? Are you going to see your house?

305
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:46,670
After your snack, go to the port to meet Paulot.

306
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,673
-OK Boss.

307
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:55,211
-Here, you see, the living room with two bathrooms on each side.

308
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:59,931
Here, the large staircase which leads to the 3 rooms.
You know, overlooking the pond ...

309
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:04,264
Towards the sun.
Here you can dine, eat, cook in the back

310
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:06,865
-It's big. It's marvelous.

311
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:11,808
-Eh ? My things will wait. I never take ..

312
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:13,537
..holiday. Eh ?

313
00:27:13,903 --> 00:27:17,220
It makes me happy to be with you for a few days.

314
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:22,120
Yes I heard. Eh?
Yes, tonight as usual. Goodbye.

315
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:28,750
Jeanne !

316
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:31,497
What is it?
- I need the suitcase.

317
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:34,080
The crocodile skin.

318
00:27:34,427 --> 00:27:37,985
-No need to scream like that.
- I don't know where it is.

319
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:39,592
-In the barn.

320
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:43,313
-You can't say it right away, right?

321
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,000
Where is it?

322
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:47,513
-There. What do you want it for?

323
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:50,789
-I'm going to Paris tomorrow. -What is this story ?

324
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:54,170
-I have to buy supplies for the villa,

325
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:57,644
.. wall lights, odds and ends.
-Missing more than that.

326
00:27:57,823 --> 00:28:00,928
-What do you mean?
- I don't understand you.

327
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,891
- I don't like hints very much.

328
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:07,211
You're completely insane.
- How?

329
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,978
Mister buys the land, Mister offers a villa!

330
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:13,907
And now Mister is going to Paris.

331
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:16,734
- You think you're a millionaire!
- Ah, that's it!

332
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:21,002
-You don't see her spinning the money.
Nothing is too good for her.

333
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:24,754
- I know what I'm doing.
- Yes, and your wallet will be empty.

334
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:29,485
- Do you earn the money?
It the one who earns that has the right to spend.

335
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:32,944
- So, with clean clothes
- You only think about money!

336
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,929
-All for a bit of ...
-of what?

337
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:38,507
-imbecile!
-All the same when it comes to another woman!

338
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:38,552


339
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,822
They are all the same.

340
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:50,526
Your problem, you'll have to see it again.

341
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,358
- Yes, sir. - Goodbye.

342
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:55,874
-Do you have a light ?

343
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,912
-Attention, please.

344
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,042
-Oh dear ! It's full to bursting.

345
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:16,953
- If we leave?

346
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,188
-Hey Martin! -Look !

347
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:21,588
- Hi Martin. How are you ?

348
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:22,788
- Are you okay?

349
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,262
I need to see you for the hospital radiators.

350
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,682
It's not urgent. Talk to the architect.

351
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:31,344
- So we're leaving? - Hey!

352
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,637
She looks ridiculous in those eccentric outfits.

353
00:29:41,732 --> 00:29:43,787
Maybe you don't agree?

354
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:45,820
- Completely ridiculous.

355
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:50,385
-Roumagnac refuses nothing.

356
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:52,993
He has offered the merry widow the masonry now.

357
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,709
This is called buying a villa in installments.

358
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,419
-That's great. The whole town is going to know about it.

359
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,914
-And after ?
-How after?

360
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:05,886
Well, the consul! His wife is going to make up her mind to die.

361
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:08,785
I hope so. Then at that moment ...

362
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:15,161
- Come in young man. Sorry.

363
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:20,027
Hello Martin!
-So, we won't see you anymore.

364
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:23,461
-Bah, the job.
-Hey ! Hey ! You wear out your health.

365
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:25,049
-How it goes!

366
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:31,088
I thought you never drank.

367
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,165
I do not drink. I like good music.

368
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:37,442
-And this hospice?
When is the ribbon cut on the mound?

369
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:40,203
I talked to Leper about heating.

370
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm sorry, but the award was made ...

371
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:46,400
.. to the combined sites.
-I was counting on it.

372
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:49,658
I turned down another job. I supported you.

373
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:53,450
But you're busy, this house you're building for ...

374
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:55,806
Mrs. Ferrand. It is said to be very beautiful.

375
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:58,171
Yes, I hope.

376
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:02,166
When the consul finds out about it.
Or tell me you're more interested in the consul!

377
00:31:03,972 --> 00:31:06,938
-Don't say that, you're exaggerating.

378
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:10,872
You are here out of interest and
Roumagnac will build me a villa.

379
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,048
It's normal that we see each other.

380
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:15,441
- Foreigners have no taste!

381
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:18,204
-They are not like us.

382
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,821
You're a popular man.
- Friends, sorry.

383
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:39,464
Did you order?
-No.

384
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:42,264
-Émile -Mr Roumagnac right away.

385
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:43,682
-Good, come back.

386
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:46,052
-They make a curious couple.

387
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:49,099
It won't take long to wear the horns.

388
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:52,675
-Like all the fools who have worshiped her.

389
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,118
-This is the package you asked for. I hope it'll be OK.

390
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,513
-I thank you. Bonnemain who grows fat from the sweat of the people.

391
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:05,214
- Are you going for a walk in Paris?

392
00:32:05,543 --> 00:32:08,428
-We are shopping for the villa tomorrow.

393
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:11,455
-For stores, there is only Paris.

394
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:41,250
-Let's talk about stores in Paris.
We can look for new things for the provinces!

395
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:55,672
What are you looking at ?

396
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,715
-Nothing. Paris.

397
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,617
Oh! Then it's stone!

398
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:03,701
- Do you see there? It is Montparnasse.

399
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:05,581
-Yes.

400
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:09,988
Do you know that area well?

401
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:14,492
We should hurry ..

402
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,415
..if you want to go to the Casino de Paris.

403
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:22,340
Oh, 8 pm already! We won't have time for dinner.

404
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,691
What are you thinking about ?

405
00:33:34,694 --> 00:33:38,599
Ah nothing. Everything that can happen to people in a hotel.

406
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:43,063
- People in a hurry who have lots of things to do.

407
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:44,664
- Or nothing more to do.

408
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:46,866
Nothing to look forward to.

409
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:51,633
The poor who have nothing to do with them,
only old newspapers ...

410
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:52,972
..and cigarette ends.

411
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:58,902
-And after ? It means nothing.

412
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:03,045
-You don't know what Paris is. -No, Paris ...

413
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:08,168
And you, you don't know the province. The province is patience.

414
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,150
Patience, you understand.

415
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:15,958
Because here, we pass. All these walls, that has nothing to say.

416
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:21,625
It's not a matter of time.

417
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:27,511
-In any case, we agree: we found what we wanted ..

418
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,933
..for the villa. Look at this.

419
00:34:31,754 --> 00:34:32,895
-What do you say ?

420
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,301
-Nothing, I wanted to...

421
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:42,626
-What did you want ?

422
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,226
- The Casino de Paris is over, it's too late. We're going to have supper.

423
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:22,288
..in a funny little thing. Eh ? If you look at me like that

424
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,711
..we may also miss supper.

425
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:30,196
You look like a princess.

426
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:34,042
You don't think I look funny. I borrowed it from ..

427
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:37,466
Bonnemain, my friend. - No, you're fine.

428
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:40,749
-Me, I do not find myself ... -You look very good

429
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:42,892


430
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:26,220
-It's nice here?

431
00:36:29,362 --> 00:36:31,030
-It is because you look beautiful.

432
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:55,589
- Sorry Mr. Excuse.

433
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:11,228


434
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:14,351


435
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,781
-You're bored. We shouldn't have come.

436
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:38,964
-But no ! Do you think !

437
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:42,814
All the people here get bored during the day

438
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:47,163
and try hard to have fun at night.

439
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:52,032
It's very warm!

440
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,776
-Madam, do you have a musical desire?

441
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:11,787
- Play "I have two big oxen in my barn",
that will be great.

442
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:31,719
-You absolutely want your music to flow in ..

443
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:35,370
..my coffee ? Do you find that it is not sweet enough?

444
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:44,747
I'm making you live. I'm like to hear nice music.

445
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:47,503
That's what we came for, right?

446
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:52,231
I beg your pardon, I am spoiling your evening.

447
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,887
I'm a brute.

448
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:55,862
-Let's see.

449
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:09,112
-You want to dance?

450
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:13,422
You know I don't know how to dance. Dancing in the style ...

451
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:17,173
..from Clairval. -My God, you are freaking out.

452
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,595
- Sir, madame dancing?

453
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:36,626
-It's me. -Also, I said to myself ...

454
00:39:36,965 --> 00:39:40,317
Did you sell your house? You did not have ...

455
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:42,933
too many problems?
- Not at all.

456
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:47,268
I got married.
- No! With whom?  This man?

457
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:50,476
-Oh no. With another who has since died.

458
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,146
-Oh yes. So?
-So, I'm a widow.

459
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:01,888
-Miss. Do you have Blue Gauls, please?

460
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:06,118
-I do not have any. Chesterfield, Players, Rio tobacco ...

461
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:09,950
-I don't smoke that stuff. Aren't you hot here?

462
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:11,531
-I am used to it.

463
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:42,268
Tell the Delage driver that his boss called.

464
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:52,158
At least here we can breathe, it's not like inside.

465
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:55,834
You have the best job.  Are you making a good living?

466
00:40:56,214 --> 00:41:00,368
Oh yes ! But this is not a job. I used to be a watchmaker.

467
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:03,704
-Ah!
-I had to stop. The eyes.

468
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:07,939
I made a small watch the size of a cherry seed.

469
00:41:08,278 --> 00:41:12,054
Seriously ? The things I do are not so small.

470
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:15,648
I am a bricklayer, I build houses.
But in house building

471
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:19,467
You also have to use your hands to make watches.

472
00:41:19,784 --> 00:41:21,083
That's how it works!

473
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,536
Wouldn't you have a blue Gallic?
Inside, they only have foreigners.

474
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,895
-With pleasure.

475
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:29,232
-Ah thank you.

476
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,786
-My dream would be to have a home.

477
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:39,020
In the countryside, with a garden and a small craftsman's workshop.

478
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:42,397
-You're right, you are so right.

479
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,209
I went out to breathe. You're having fun ?

480
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,907
-Not at all. - Are we going elsewhere?

481
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:52,626
-No. Let's go back to the hotel.

482
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:55,341
-I'm going to get the bill. Oh, tell me!

483
00:41:55,662 --> 00:41:58,916
Here is the wall lamp for the villa. I'll ask where ..

484
00:41:59,256 --> 00:42:01,436
..they bought it. She's fine.

485
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:12,241
-They are beautiful.

486
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,998
-Are they looking well?

487
00:42:16,056 --> 00:42:19,292
-The house, the furniture, the view,

488
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:21,469
..everything is wonderful!

489
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,385
-It's thanks to you. You were a bit of an architect.

490
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:27,403
Now I want to tell you something.

491
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:30,959
Here, I find you in Paris when I thought I had lost you.

492
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,676
You were elsewhere.

493
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,392
-I can never thank you enough.
-Why ?

494
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:37,370
To do something I love ...

495
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:41,126
..for someone I love.
I should thank you.

496
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:46,637
-Do you believe in four-leaf clovers?

497
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:49,335
-No, but this one, yes.
-Me too.

498
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:52,252
It has given us real luck. Take it.

499
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:56,467
No, you appreciate it very much.
-That's why I'm giving it to you.

500
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:59,204
-You or I who have it, it's the same.

501
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:02,400
-Exactly ! As it works for both of us.

502
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:11,118
-You could knock.
-I did knock.

503
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:15,789
Mrs. Your uncle gave me this..
He needs you after lunch.

504
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:17,051
-Thank you Annette.

505
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:20,477
Catalog of seeds, bird magazine.

506
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,303
An obituary.

507
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,287
Is it a family member?

508
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:31,199
-No. The wife of a diplomat, a consul.

509
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,164
An old friend of my parents.

510
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,141
Oh ! It is touching.

511
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:47,271
-Oh that ! I bet it's your college sweetheart.

512
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:50,477
-He is not a student, he is a supervisor.

513
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:54,105
-He must ruin himself in stamps. When he doesn't write to you,

514
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:58,073
..he wanders around the store dreaming of you. How funny.

515
00:43:58,855 --> 00:44:00,017
-That's so boring !

516
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,884
-Why ?
Do you have to go to the funeral?

517
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:05,971
No, but the consul is coming to see my uncle.

518
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:07,053
-So what ?

519
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:10,197
-We cannot be quiet any longer, the two of us.

520
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,363
Maybe he won't stay long, huh?

521
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:18,054
-Oh !  It's eleven o'clock already!
Oh dear !

522
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:25,028
-Do I make you forget about your business?
-Don't talk nonsense.

523
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:30,561
But before you leave, give me a little signature here.

524
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,223
What's this ?

525
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:37,091
-It's for the notary. This little piece of paper, dear madam,

526
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:38,955
It makes you the owner.

527
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:43,263
-But I haven't paid anything yet,
neither for the land or the villa. I want...

528
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,332
-I want ! The king said: We want!

529
00:44:46,674 --> 00:44:47,355
Sign.

530
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:06,093
- Is the room ready for Mr De Laubrie?
He's coming tonight.

531
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:09,360
-Yes, Mrs.
-I will bring the flowers myself.

532
00:45:09,698 --> 00:45:10,523
-Very good, madam.

533
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:24,931
Ma'am, I beg your pardon

534
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:29,359
I know ... I realise my audacity and my impropriety.

535
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:33,408
But I had to talk to you. For so long...

536
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:36,274
I have wanted to tell you ...
-Don't say it.

537
00:45:36,593 --> 00:45:39,320
Besides, I know you wrote to me.

538
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,986
You must not longer write to me anymore.

539
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:45,410
-Since the first day I saw you ...

540
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:47,137
-I have loved you.

541
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,693
But I do not love you.

542
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,315
Don't be sad.

543
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:02,842
What matters is not so much to be loved, it is to love.

544
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:04,402
You think of me.

545
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:07,429
When you are alone, you talk to me.

546
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:11,454
You dream of doing wonderful things for me,

547
00:46:11,656 --> 00:46:14,498
.. extraordinary things. So ?

548
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:16,901
Why be sad?

549
00:46:18,102 --> 00:46:19,986
You're very lucky.

550
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:23,312
There are so few people who can love.

551
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:28,140
-I find you so beautiful.

552
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:38,532
Now you have to go.
No, no, don't say anything more.

553
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:39,715
Go on.

554
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:58,502
-Bonnemain, have you seen Gargame?

555
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:01,488
- Yes, he's at billiards.
-I can see him.

556
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:06,734
It is a stroke of champion!, Hello Mr. Gargame.

557
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,901
-Hello. This is not billiards. We should be able to practice.

558
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:14,127
..every day, but I have other things to do.

559
00:47:14,308 --> 00:47:18,413
-Oh yes. I stopped by your house, I was told you were here.

560
00:47:20,456 --> 00:47:22,298
- There it is, still too strong.

561
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:24,661
Did you want to talk to me?

562
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,726
-It's about our end of month deadline.

563
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:30,610
Can we delay it for another month?

564
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:34,577
What a question! Two months if you want.

565
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:38,302
Have you finished on the bridge?

566
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:43,310
I'm almost finished, but I'm a little frustrated ...

567
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:45,551
because I have nothing interesting for later.

568
00:47:47,294 --> 00:47:48,594
-That's a nice shot, yes!

569
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:52,453
I was offered the construction of the combined stores.

570
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,977
- What? Aren't you going to do it?
- Why?

571
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,433
The project that everyone refused:
was taken by Richard and Patterson ...

572
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:01,116
They have better quality than you.

573
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:03,070
Some folk are afraid of everything.

574
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:06,588
- Come on! They are not crazy. It's not a building site,

575
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,722
..It's a disaster.

576
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:13,887
Do you know anything about the investigations that were done?

577
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:15,117
Infiltrations everywhere.

578
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:19,231
If I don't get something,
I will have to lay off my workers temporarily.

579
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:22,299
-I'm not in the habit of meddling in things that don't concern me.

580
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,748
It's not my style to lecture, but you do stupid things.

581
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:28,790
-Who risks nothing, has nothing.

582
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:32,315
-Is that so ! I don't mind, if it amuses you doing nonsense.

583
00:48:33,386 --> 00:48:36,596
There you are, you made me miss my shot.
Are you happy?

584
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:50,691
-Hello Blanche?

585
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:52,044
Yes.

586
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,142
How does that matter? Bah!

587
00:48:56,486 --> 00:48:59,979
For eight days since your consul arrived,
there has been no way to see you.

588
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:02,283
It's all for him. Eh ?

589
00:49:03,939 --> 00:49:07,027
My dear, obviously I can understand, I'm not crazy.

590
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:08,846
But there are limits.

591
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,007
Eh ?

592
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,226
At 8 o'clock this evening at the villa?

593
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:19,467
Okay.

594
00:49:19,851 --> 00:49:20,862
-See you tonight then.

595
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:32,917
Did you invite him to dinner?

596
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,743
I tell you bluntly, you're crazy.

597
00:49:35,966 --> 00:49:39,903
-I'm doing it to calm him down otherwise
God knows what nonsense he would do.

598
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,789
And besides, yes, I'm looking forward to seeing him!

599
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:52,663
-By the way, has he talked yet of marriage?

600
00:49:52,663 --> 00:49:53,789
-Roumagnac?

601
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:56,438
-No, the consul!
-Not yet.

602
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,324
-For the moment, he talks to me about politics.

603
00:50:01,137 --> 00:50:05,036
-The same evening, the minister was overthrown..

604
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:08,305
...and I was unfortunate to be ambassador.

605
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:11,220
-But ... I'm chatting and it's late.

606
00:50:11,397 --> 00:50:14,390
Yes, I took a long walk in the afternoon.

607
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:17,403
You must be tired. -I can see that...

608
00:50:18,075 --> 00:50:20,220
Delighted to have met you.

609
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,194
-Me too. Sorry, I offer sincerely..

610
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:26,740
..my condolences. -Yes. The death of my wife.

611
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,362
..was a great misfortune for me. It has left an immense void.

612
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:33,307
She had long been condemned by doctors.

613
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,077
Some deaths are deliverance.

614
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:38,452
- Alas!

615
00:50:39,246 --> 00:50:40,565
Bye. -Good evening.

616
00:50:41,393 --> 00:50:43,282
-Good evening. -I accompany you.

617
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:44,425
-Yes.

618
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:55,671
That is someone, your consul.
I like his mentality,

619
00:50:56,044 --> 00:50:59,000
..but he has education and he does not abuse it.

620
00:50:59,196 --> 00:51:03,352
- Discretion is what characterises well-bred people.

621
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:06,187
-Ah well! Goodnight uncle.
-Uncle ?

622
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,529
-Uncle cake.

623
00:51:12,825 --> 00:51:15,818
This Roumagnac is interesting,
quite a character.

624
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:18,930
Good evening dear friend. As Shakespeare says:

625
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,666
.. "May sweet dreams rock your cradle".

626
00:51:22,238 --> 00:51:24,628
-Thank you. -Blanche.

627
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:29,822
-Excuse me, I didn't say goodnight to you.

628
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,258
-Goodnight Mr. consul.

629
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:32,286
-Goodnight.

630
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:37,116
-The shock was not too severe, but we should continue.

631
00:51:38,723 --> 00:51:41,243
Uncle cake, uncle cake!

632
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,003
-There you are !

633
00:52:29,123 --> 00:52:32,165
I was worried, I thought you weren't coming.

634
00:52:34,729 --> 00:52:35,508
My dear!

635
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:41,385
You don't know how much I missed you!

636
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:44,312
When I don't see you I feel lost.

637
00:52:44,655 --> 00:52:45,316
-I'm cold.

638
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:48,249
Hold me, I will warm you up.

639
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:50,490
-Next time, make a fire.

640
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:54,662
Good thing your consul returns to his consulate.

641
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:01,433
You are much better than the others.

642
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:04,786
-No,  I love you.

643
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:08,380
I love you.

644
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:10,822
I love you.

645
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:14,790
That's it !

646
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:19,180
Here. -Thank you Mr. Roumagnac.

647
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,443
-It's nothing, just a spark plug.

648
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:23,703
- Are you going to the villa?
-Yes.

649
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,984
-Mrs Ferrand is gone. -Yes ?

650
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,549
-Yes, with a man in the car. They asked me for direction.

651
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:33,397
..from the Charmettes mill. -Oh good, thank you.

652
00:53:34,415 --> 00:53:35,903
Goodbye Mrs. Percheron.

653
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:04,254
-These cakes are exquisite, your uncle would love them.

654
00:54:04,598 --> 00:54:06,004
What a lovely bouquet.

655
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,609
In the language of flowers, the daisy says: Do you love me?

656
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:13,681
The buttercup: Don't make fun of me,
Let's take advantage of youth. -

657
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:16,892
This language is also part of your studies?

658
00:54:17,017 --> 00:54:20,581
The duty of a diplomat is to speak flowery language.

659
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,827
Listen. How about uniting a widow with a widower?

660
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,650
Would you like to be Madame de Laubrie?

661
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:34,354
But you have never told me that you love me.

662
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:36,046
The proposal is a bit steep.

663
00:54:36,385 --> 00:54:39,074
-For 2 years, I have been waiting for you, you know it.

664
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:44,408
Unfortunately there was an obstacle for 2 years,
- my poor wife.

665
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:49,366
We did everything to save her, but doctors cannot work miracles.

666
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:51,236
Now I am free.

667
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:54,384
And rich. -Yes I understand.

668
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:58,047
Think of the advantage of joining forces.

669
00:54:58,366 --> 00:55:01,571
Ambition alone equates to the seven deadly sins.

670
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:04,677
-What pleasure is there in dominating what one despises?

671
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:06,012
-This is the proverb:

672
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:09,774
divide and you will triumph.  It is government based on police reports,

673
00:55:10,055 --> 00:55:13,418
..learning what separates humanity, raises them up..

674
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:15,590
. against others, using hatred.

675
00:55:15,948 --> 00:55:18,733
And their vices.
-But you're terrible.

676
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:23,016
Do not jest. I'm not talking about selling birds.

677
00:55:23,473 --> 00:55:27,536
I never believed it. - You could have said it earlier.

678
00:55:27,893 --> 00:55:31,516
Because the birds are beautiful, but the seeds ...

679
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:35,040
-I'm talking to a woman who has seen and experienced a lot.

680
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:37,172
As smart as she is beautiful.

681
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:40,098
You could help me by bringing grace,

682
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:43,484
..the warmth of your seduction.

683
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:47,901
I offer you something better than love.
Seriously, he's following us everywhere.

684
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,948
-But he didn't know we were here.

685
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:56,227
-Hello. I was passing by and saw your car.

686
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:58,234
-as chance would have it.

687
00:55:59,111 --> 00:56:01,798
-I was having engine trouble. Am I bothering you ?

688
00:56:02,137 --> 00:56:05,136
- Not at all. -You mind?

689
00:56:05,498 --> 00:56:06,482
-Pardon.

690
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:10,252
Miss.

691
00:56:15,813 --> 00:56:17,433
Tea ? -Eh ?

692
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,228
You want tea?

693
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:23,125
-No. You know my tastes.
Bring me a Pernod.

694
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:25,940
How are you ?

695
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:27,678
Fine, thanks.

696
00:56:28,497 --> 00:56:29,394
-Oh Lucette!

697
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:32,729
You lost your working tool.

698
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:36,269
-Thank you Mr. Roumagnac.

699
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:43,341
-Such beautiful weather today. -Very nice day.

700
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,138
- It's nice here. - Very pleasant.

701
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,231
I have remodelled everything here.

702
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,612
-Oh yes ? -Yes.

703
00:56:55,005 --> 00:56:56,885
Ah! Very cold water.

704
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:08,691
I don't know if water drinkers are bad, but I ...

705
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:12,067
-Oh ! I only drink water, so judge for yourself...

706
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,747
-She is really nice.

707
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:16,462
You look agitated, what's wrong?

708
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:18,379
-Me ? What an idea !

709
00:57:23,714 --> 00:57:26,790
What are you doing here?
Paulot, my foreman.

710
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:30,267
-Hello. Madame, Mr. Ferrand, told me you were here.

711
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:33,363
-So ?
-There was an accident at the construction site.

712
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:35,679
-What ?
-The bridge has collapsed

713
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:38,717
How could this happen?
-I don't know. Fate.

714
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:41,833
Fate does not exist.
Have there been any injuries?

715
00:57:42,113 --> 00:57:42,932
- One.
- Who?

716
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:44,670
-Perrin.
-It's serious ?

717
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:47,050
-The poor man looks pretty messed up.

718
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:50,183
-Good God ! I beg your pardon.

719
00:57:50,522 --> 00:57:53,520
- I hope it's not serious.
-Excuse me.

720
00:57:57,116 --> 00:57:59,794
-He knew perfectly well how to find us here.

721
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:04,866
- Is he in love with you...
-Roumagnac? Oh ! You are kidding.

722
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:08,346
-Oh ! A dog has every right to look at royalty.

723
00:58:09,643 --> 00:58:12,539
By the way, because of him, you didn't respond.

724
00:58:12,758 --> 00:58:15,494
..at my proposal. -When we speak about the soul,

725
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:19,251
..he responds immediately.
It has been addressed to the intellect.

726
00:58:19,611 --> 00:58:22,586
- And that calls for reflection.
- Exactly.

727
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:25,564
Since it is a partnership.

728
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:28,880
At first glance, the matter seems feasible.

729
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,813
- You will see, you will soon be on your feet.

730
00:58:35,152 --> 00:58:36,473
-Come on, step aside.

731
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,121
-I told you it would end like this.

732
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:46,699
- You will go slowly.

733
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:49,938
-Will you save him?

734
00:58:50,255 --> 00:58:52,534
-You know, the spine ...

735
00:58:58,865 --> 00:59:01,841
- Don't worry François, we'll get you out of here.

736
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:05,778
I wonder how this could have happened.

737
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:07,802
-Yes.
- What's up?

738
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:10,798
-Nothing, there would be too much to say.

739
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,283
-Let's see that. -Martin.

740
00:59:12,628 --> 00:59:14,621
- What is it?
- Come here a minute.

741
00:59:21,154 --> 00:59:23,310
-What is it? -A crossbar gave way.

742
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:25,871
I discovered it was weak, I told you.

743
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:28,295
- Stop!
I'll call the insurance.

744
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:29,880
- Damn it !
- What is it?

745
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:32,791
- I didn't pay the insurance premium.
-You didn't pay it?

746
00:59:33,177 --> 00:59:34,355
If he stays there?

747
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:38,363
With three kids. -I know he has three kids!

748
01:00:01,922 --> 01:00:03,545
-Oh, it's you! I was sleeping.

749
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:09,820
-Excuse me, but I spent the whole night waiting for you.

750
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:11,684
Why didn't you come?

751
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,047
- Don't speak so loud.

752
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:17,374
-Ah! It's true ! I forgot:
- the consul!

753
01:00:17,756 --> 01:00:19,939
His Majesty the Consul is sleeping!

754
01:00:20,281 --> 01:00:25,846
I hope the wind has not disturbed you.
There has been a very strong wind tonight.

755
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:27,662
It's ridiculous

756
01:00:28,794 --> 01:00:30,178
-Ridiculous.

757
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:33,232
..I was waiting for you.
Why didn't you come?

758
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:36,544
- Do you want to wake him up?
- God! We can't do that!

759
01:00:36,725 --> 01:00:40,128
Since he's been here, I can't see you anymore.
Why didn't you come?

760
01:00:40,454 --> 01:00:43,019
-I could not.
- Has he spent the night with you?

761
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:45,912
-You are too stupid !
- I don't have the education.

762
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:49,795
- Leave. If you have trouble at work,
I have nothing to do with it.

763
01:00:50,065 --> 01:00:52,532
I assure you, it is better if you leave.

764
01:00:52,842 --> 01:00:56,717
- You did that in the stable.
You're right, I had better go.

765
01:01:04,406 --> 01:01:07,102
-Mr. De Laubrie is coming down.
-Thank you Annette.

766
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:10,826
Hello.

767
01:01:11,185 --> 01:01:14,344
-I hope he didn't hear anything.
- Heard what?

768
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:17,841
-Unfortunately, I heard everything.

769
01:01:18,181 --> 01:01:21,017
- And what else?
- I would like to stop you from doing ...

770
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,155
Nonsense. I know myself,
I've been doing this my whole life.

771
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:28,651
There are silly things that's what one can do best

772
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,570
- but you shouldn't do them foolishly.
- I know.

773
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,347
-Your mason is leading us to disaster.

774
01:01:34,648 --> 01:01:35,505
-Remain silent.

775
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:40,463
-Hello good friend. -Hello.

776
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:47,297
- Did you sleep well?
-Admirably.

777
01:01:51,313 --> 01:01:55,071
However, I was awakened very early by a noise.

778
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,409
...like a slamming door.

779
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:01,924
That maid.
That crazy old woman takes pleasure by making drafts

780
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:08,419
-There is no maid without fault.
I even seemed to hear bursts of voices

781
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,939
-It was me.

782
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:13,974
I went downstairs to tell him to leave.

783
01:02:14,615 --> 01:02:15,635
-It's curious.

784
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:19,370
I could have sworn it was our friend's voice.

785
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:20,570
Roumagnac.

786
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,647
-Well yes, it was Roumagnac.

787
01:02:26,645 --> 01:02:29,203
-You had a business discussion?

788
01:02:29,563 --> 01:02:30,221
- Leave us.

789
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:34,498
This is absurd, an absurd misunderstanding.

790
01:02:34,779 --> 01:02:36,797
-I asked you to leave us.

791
01:02:46,468 --> 01:02:48,227
-Roumagnac is familiar with you?

792
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:53,223
I thought he offered me a partnership,
it was not a sentimental matter...

793
01:02:53,464 --> 01:02:55,521
-Exactly.

794
01:02:55,861 --> 01:02:59,298
So? As long as it's not Mrs. De Laubrie.

795
01:02:59,658 --> 01:03:04,593
-But ... Even if you were, you would be free.

796
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,210
You still have to choose your partners.

797
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:12,306
I agree that Roumagnac is the best of men,

798
01:03:12,507 --> 01:03:17,304
..but what bothers me about him,
forgive me, he is a mason.

799
01:03:17,963 --> 01:03:19,402
Obviously, that degrades us.

800
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:23,119
-He only has good feelings, but good feelings,

801
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:25,317
..with syntax errors.

802
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:28,100
-Not everyone can juggle vocabulary.

803
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,778
Of course.

804
01:03:30,959 --> 01:03:34,515
His heart is in his hand,
but his hands are questionably clean.

805
01:03:35,073 --> 01:03:37,649
It is less serious than a dirty soul.

806
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:42,100
In a salon,
a black soul is less noticeable than black nails in mourning.

807
01:03:42,437 --> 01:03:47,122
Let's talk seriously.
This worker who smells of red wine and mortar.

808
01:03:47,122 --> 01:03:50,614
Doesn't the smell of mortar bother you?

809
01:03:50,614 --> 01:03:52,913
- Less than that of a corpse.

810
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:57,275
-Seriously, I don't understand.

811
01:03:57,597 --> 01:04:00,882
-Your wife whose millions you have been eagerly stalking.

812
01:04:01,032 --> 01:04:04,541
This dying woman, whom you buried every day for 2 years ...

813
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:07,202
..in thoughts. Nice engagement gift.

814
01:04:07,523 --> 01:04:10,390
..that you brought me there. A corpse!

815
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:15,466
-That's an informative interview!
I understand the type of partner

816
01:04:15,788 --> 01:04:18,995
..which suits you.
Today the house builder, tomorrow

817
01:04:19,297 --> 01:04:20,354
Servants.

818
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:23,468
The butler, the driver.

819
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:30,430
Disgusting! Roumagnac is 100 times better than you.

820
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:41,311
-It's unfortunate to end this game.

821
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:42,787
-congratulatiions, Bonnemain.

822
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:47,063
What did you say about Roumagnac?

823
01:04:47,403 --> 01:04:50,774
The injured worker, from the construction site, died in hospital.

824
01:04:51,114 --> 01:04:53,020
Talk of the devil...

825
01:04:58,076 --> 01:04:58,940
-Hello Martin.

826
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,326
-Hello Roumagnac.

827
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:02,692
-How are you ?
-Good

828
01:05:03,516 --> 01:05:05,721
-Hello.
- Can I say a word to you?

829
01:05:05,922 --> 01:05:07,428
-Yes.
-Excuse us?

830
01:05:13,928 --> 01:05:15,313
Give us two white wines.

831
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:23,981
I have a financial problem. Can you lend me ...

832
01:05:24,363 --> 01:05:27,352
..50 thousand? For a month,
enough time to turn it around.

833
01:05:27,713 --> 01:05:30,122
As you're a friend ...
-you have done well.

834
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:33,431
Only, I had big outgoings this week.

835
01:05:33,773 --> 01:05:36,342
-Oh yes ?
-In trade, there are invoices ...

836
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,652
The money did not come in quickly.
-I understand.

837
01:05:40,074 --> 01:05:42,764
-We never have enough cash.
-Understood.

838
01:05:43,085 --> 01:05:46,154
I had forgotten that in commerce, there is no cashflow.

839
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,264
I appreciate it anyway. How much do I owe you?

840
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:50,971
- You're kidding.
- Oh no.

841
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,118
-It's on me.
-This wine is good.

842
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,182
Thank you.

843
01:06:06,481 --> 01:06:07,504
-Ah finally !

844
01:06:07,845 --> 01:06:10,934
-The trade! La Ferrand is also in the business.

845
01:06:11,236 --> 01:06:14,325
All he has to do is ask him for money. I didn't give him any.

846
01:06:14,707 --> 01:06:17,516
..build a villa by eye. -You don't have the courage.

847
01:06:17,855 --> 01:06:21,069
-She is with him out of interest. She sells birds.

848
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:23,837
The pigeons, she feathers them.

849
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,670
-It seems that in the evening above the store,

850
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,576
there are mysterious meetings.

851
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:32,527
-Don't even bother us!

852
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:34,692
- Well, you go ?.
- Yes.

853
01:06:35,675 --> 01:06:37,019
- What did you say?

854
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:39,468
-What ? -What did you say ?

855
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:41,673
-I told the truth.

856
01:06:41,935 --> 01:06:45,468
Damn you bastard! You are all bastards.
You slander him ...

857
01:06:45,789 --> 01:06:49,158
After something you can't have. Yell at the bourgeoisie,

858
01:06:49,502 --> 01:06:53,031
..but when isomeone like me touches a girl like that,

859
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:56,705
..that pisses you off even more. Rotten!

860
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:02,221
-What's wrong with him?

861
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:08,222


862
01:07:09,766 --> 01:07:10,570
Who is it?

863
01:07:15,284 --> 01:07:16,029
-A ghost.

864
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:19,276
-I don't believe in ghosts.

865
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,817
Hey! You have moved the dressing table.

866
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:32,903
Blanche. Since Roumagnac is in your life, you don't want to ...

867
01:07:33,245 --> 01:07:34,085
..see me.

868
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,279
-What is finished is finished.

869
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:45,081
-But I can't do without you. I am married, I have no right ..

870
01:07:45,423 --> 01:07:49,034
..to ask for more than I can give. You don't even listen to me.

871
01:07:49,396 --> 01:07:51,021
I am here, I exist!

872
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,188
Barely

873
01:07:57,905 --> 01:08:01,754
Am I at least in your game?
The jack of diamonds

874
01:08:01,754 --> 01:08:01,754


875
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:05,658
-You have never been in the game

876
01:08:05,658 --> 01:08:07,114
-my poor friend.

877
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:22,074
- I know that you are very attached to Roumagnac.

878
01:08:22,413 --> 01:08:24,841
-Attached? These are your words.

879
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,632
Now he has money problems.

880
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,537
He's a man I admire. I have influence in the council.

881
01:08:31,855 --> 01:08:34,864
If I spoke for him ...
-You would do that?

882
01:08:35,222 --> 01:08:36,258
Yes, for you.

883
01:08:37,054 --> 01:08:40,443
If necessary, I'm ready ... to accept...

884
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:41,756
-The sharing ?

885
01:08:42,872 --> 01:08:45,960
-Anything, rather than losing you.  Blanche!

886
01:08:47,015 --> 01:08:50,600
-Go home. You are just a petty little man.

887
01:08:51,417 --> 01:08:53,509
A pathetic man.

888
01:08:54,007 --> 01:08:56,019
Well, I think I'm very good!

889
01:08:57,453 --> 01:09:00,242
My patience has limits, enough is enough!

890
01:09:01,118 --> 01:09:04,107
I promise you will hear from me.

891
01:09:05,143 --> 01:09:07,772
-Oh let's see! Dear friend !

892
01:09:43,453 --> 01:09:45,881
- Oh, come on, here is the mason, now!

893
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:49,288
-Is Blanche up there? - Wait, no.

894
01:09:49,645 --> 01:09:52,154
I think ... -I'm sure she's there.

895
01:09:52,494 --> 01:09:53,334
I'm coming down.

896
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:03,989
- Who were you with ?
- Who was I with?

897
01:10:07,086 --> 01:10:08,086
-Yes.

898
01:10:08,444 --> 01:10:11,800
Maybe you weren't alone up there. Dare to admit it!

899
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:14,534
-What does that mean ? -How? 'Or' What ?

900
01:10:14,814 --> 01:10:17,172
The uncle prevents me from going up,

901
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:21,746
..you come down quickly.
Don't look at me like that, don't play innocent!

902
01:10:22,104 --> 01:10:23,760
I know what happens up there.

903
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,836
-You are crazy.
-No. I understand now.

904
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:29,770
What do you understand? You fool!

905
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:33,626
Yes, it starts here and then ends up there in your room!

906
01:10:34,961 --> 01:10:37,598
-You are despicable! -Is that perhaps not true?

907
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:39,116
-You are despicable.

908
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:41,115
Go away.

909
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,527
Go away and never come back.

910
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:47,246
Never !

911
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:48,839
Bitch!

912
01:10:58,364 --> 01:10:59,483
-What's the matter with you ?

913
01:10:59,821 --> 01:11:04,875
-I have enough ! I can't take it anymore!
I'm sick of this town!

914
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:08,348
I've had enough of this stupid life! I can not stand it anymore !

915
01:11:08,768 --> 01:11:11,283
It's over, we're leaving!
What about the store?

916
01:11:11,624 --> 01:11:15,936
The store is over. I can't take it anymore! We will sell everything.

917
01:11:16,316 --> 01:11:18,450
- No more store, no more consul.

918
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:23,085
We start over as before:
hotel rooms that no one knows.

919
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:25,441
..how to pay.
-I do not care.

920
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,298
I just want to leave.

921
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:35,166
What are you doing?
Come on, stop! It's silly, madness!

922
01:11:37,222 --> 01:11:40,698
-To leave ! Do you understand what it means to leave?

923
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:43,872
-This is madness. They are going to die!

924
01:11:44,211 --> 01:11:46,767
Maybe they will die, but in freedom.

925
01:12:11,047 --> 01:12:14,170
-You have to be courageous. -Yes, but still.

926
01:12:14,488 --> 01:12:17,033
Three children. It's not fair.

927
01:12:17,372 --> 01:12:21,371
-You can count on my brother, he won't let you down.

928
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:30,064
It's good that you came. He was a good guy.

929
01:12:30,403 --> 01:12:32,193
-Yes. I want to talk to you.

930
01:12:34,819 --> 01:12:38,301
Is it true what I was told, that you borrowed from Bonnemain?

931
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:41,801
- You could have thought of me.
- I already thought about it,

932
01:12:42,141 --> 01:12:45,581
... but I already still owe him a lot, plus a few favors ...

933
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:49,342
You know the other day ... -I lectured you, and after?

934
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,240
We've known each other for 20 years and I can't talk to you !?

935
01:12:53,718 --> 01:12:56,582
-Yes, of course, but I haven't ... -What?

936
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,223
Come see me for the money. -Thank you.

937
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:04,838
I have no illusions, I'll give it to you as a lost fund

938
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:08,600
-Why do you say that ?
- I've lost confidence in you.

939
01:13:08,937 --> 01:13:10,230
- But ... - Let me speak.

940
01:13:10,568 --> 01:13:13,611
You can do what you want afterwards. You are an imbecile.

941
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,163
- How? - An idiot.

942
01:13:15,444 --> 01:13:17,630
She makes you crazy.
-What ?

943
01:13:17,908 --> 01:13:21,290
Yes, Blanche Ferrand makes fun of you.
She is a bitch. Everyone...

944
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:25,270
.. knows it and you don't see it.
We all laugh about it and we are right.

945
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,034
- It's unfortunate. - People tell stories.

946
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:32,311
-Stories ? Did she tell you she sold her store?

947
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:35,555
-Sold?
-You see, you didn't even know that.

948
01:13:35,752 --> 01:13:38,200
-It's not true.
-She signed yesterday.

949
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,674
-It's not true !

950
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:42,894
-It does not amuse me to tell you that.

951
01:13:43,273 --> 01:13:46,112
I would like to see you react, be a man!

952
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,884
-It's impossible!

953
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:51,215
- Let's go... the service has started.

954
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:54,916
-I'm going back, I forgot...
-You forgot what?

955
01:13:55,094 --> 01:13:58,235
Some documents in my car. I'll be back in two minutes.

956
01:14:40,604 --> 01:14:41,941
You want something, sir. ?

957
01:14:41,953 --> 01:14:43,648
-Nothing sir.

958
01:14:43,971 --> 01:14:46,873
- I was passing by and ...
- I'm the new owner.

959
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:51,614
I have bought the store. You are undoubtedly a friend of the Ferrands.

960
01:14:51,917 --> 01:14:53,591
Yes, they are friends of mine.

961
01:14:53,934 --> 01:14:56,738
Mrs. Ferrand's uncle is coming back right away.

962
01:14:57,122 --> 01:15:01,092
We will make an estimate to buy the furniture also.

963
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:06,502
They're leaving the district and they're
not interested in packing all that.

964
01:15:07,104 --> 01:15:10,532
-Are they leaving the region?
-Yes. I don't consider the birds..

965
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,072
... they are are too much care for.

966
01:15:29,732 --> 01:15:30,558
-Ah !

967
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:33,080
There you are.

968
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:40,582
Thank you. I take it into account.
Have a nice day!

969
01:15:40,785 --> 01:15:41,811
-Yes magnificent.

970
01:15:55,808 --> 01:15:57,362
Can I give you a hand?

971
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,061
If I'm bothering you, just tell me.

972
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:03,895
I am used to it.

973
01:16:03,895 --> 01:16:07,385
I hope you sold your store at a good price.

974
01:16:09,624 --> 01:16:13,538
Don't be fooled by the villa. It's worth the money!

975
01:16:13,881 --> 01:16:15,900
I know something about it myself.

976
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:21,321
Like that, you\re getting into politics now.
Are you going to see your Consul again..

977
01:16:21,321 --> 01:16:23,659
Consul? - What a fool you are.

978
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:26,516
No, I'm not going to find him. I'm going alone.

979
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,052
-I do not believe you.

980
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:31,945
You're only good at lying.
You've been doing it from the beginning!

981
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:35,560
You made me look ridiculous.
You will never see your consul again!

982
01:16:35,853 --> 01:16:37,049
-Poor idiot !

983
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:42,306
Do not touch me !
-How so ?

984
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,154
-Do not touch me with your dirty hands anymore.

985
01:16:45,515 --> 01:16:48,100
-You haven't always said that.
-You hurt me !

986
01:16:48,443 --> 01:16:52,173
- I am not educated.
-You are nothing but a poor, ridiculous bastard!!

987
01:16:52,455 --> 01:16:55,701
- Shut your mouth?
-No ! With your words smelling of Pernod!

988
01:16:55,982 --> 01:16:58,349
- Are you going to shut up?

989
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:01,636
-You will shut up!
You're just a poor man!

990
01:17:01,978 --> 01:17:05,086
-Consul is over! -Leave me ! You hurt me !

991
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:08,392
No one else! It's over ! It's over !

992
01:17:08,714 --> 01:17:11,481
It's finished ! Over!

993
01:17:19,121 --> 01:17:21,088
Filthy liar!

994
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:11,229
-Where have you been ?

995
01:18:11,773 --> 01:18:14,938
It's been almost an hour since I got home by the bus.

996
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:18,105
It is shameful what you have done.

997
01:18:18,937 --> 01:18:21,469
You left the funeral without any explanation.

998
01:18:21,786 --> 01:18:23,428
You made a very good impression.

999
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:27,306
- I was ashamed.
- Leave me alone.

1000
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:31,321
- Have you eaten?
- No, I am not hungry.

1001
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:34,804
What have you done to your hand?

1002
01:18:35,951 --> 01:18:36,920
You fell ?

1003
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,592
Did you fight? Something must have happened.

1004
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:43,509
-Leave me alone.

1005
01:18:54,307 --> 01:18:56,986
- Still in trouble because of her? Surely.

1006
01:18:59,597 --> 01:19:01,569
I understand where you have been.

1007
01:19:03,036 --> 01:19:04,303
And you hit her.

1008
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:09,553
-Never talk to me about her again. It's over now.

1009
01:19:14,622 --> 01:19:17,659
-It's not possible ! It would be too good!

1010
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:20,252
-I killed her.

1011
01:19:24,213 --> 01:19:25,261
- Did you kill her?

1012
01:19:26,587 --> 01:19:29,243
Martin, that's not true, you didn't do that.

1013
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:30,730
-Yes, I killed her.

1014
01:19:32,842 --> 01:19:35,555
Then they will come. They will take you!

1015
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:38,554
Don't bother me! This is not the time!

1016
01:19:41,368 --> 01:19:44,930
-Martin. Tell me how it happened. Say.

1017
01:19:45,331 --> 01:19:47,322
Were you at the store?
-No.

1018
01:19:47,665 --> 01:19:49,193
-At the villa?

1019
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:53,095
- Has anyone seen you? -No, it was just the two of us.

1020
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:56,331
-When you left?
-No, nobody after...

1021
01:19:56,694 --> 01:19:58,442
It was starting to burn.

1022
01:19:58,785 --> 01:19:59,469
-Ah...

1023
01:20:02,608 --> 01:20:04,617
But then, if no one has seen you ...

1024
01:20:06,207 --> 01:20:08,361
Don't stay like that. You have to shake yourself up!

1025
01:20:08,683 --> 01:20:11,636
-I do not care ! -There were lots of men around her.

1026
01:20:11,817 --> 01:20:14,594
Why should they suspect you?

1027
01:20:15,701 --> 01:20:19,599
The Roumagnacs are not murderers. Think about your father.

1028
01:20:22,337 --> 01:20:25,434
-It's nothing, it's just the postman making his rounds.

1029
01:20:26,681 --> 01:20:29,798
- Hey, he's coming down from the bridge, he's coming over here.

1030
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,288
Gett yourself together. Come on!

1031
01:20:48,522 --> 01:20:50,030
It's one o'clock, do you understand?

1032
01:20:50,754 --> 01:20:54,556
It's been a long time since you've come and eaten with me.

1033
01:20:59,381 --> 01:21:00,930
- Good day.
- Hello.

1034
01:21:01,493 --> 01:21:04,087
Hello. Enjoy your meal.

1035
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:07,043
We're done. I'll serve you coffee right now.

1036
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:10,765
A glass of wine ?

1037
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:13,015
Well, that never killed anyone!

1038
01:21:16,545 --> 01:21:18,967
Oh ! My god, how hot it is.

1039
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:22,028
-It is because you did it quickly.

1040
01:21:23,174 --> 01:21:25,509
-How, it's only one o'clock?

1041
01:21:27,393 --> 01:21:29,393
Have you thrown the mail into the river?

1042
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:31,711
To your health! -Cheers !

1043
01:21:31,711 --> 01:21:32,225


1044
01:21:32,225 --> 01:21:34,502
-We don't drink coffee.

1045
01:21:37,611 --> 01:21:40,305
I don't want to go back with my head on the ground.

1046
01:21:43,905 --> 01:21:46,576
Another that the Prussians will not have!

1047
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:47,692
Goodbye.

1048
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:48,896
Come on.

1049
01:21:51,897 --> 01:21:53,273
-Bye. -See you tomorrow.

1050
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:07,303
-Did you understand ? If necessary, it will give us an alibi.

1051
01:22:08,297 --> 01:22:11,432
It’s terrible what happened. If you had listened to me ...

1052
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:13,490
She wasn't a woman for you.

1053
01:22:16,911 --> 01:22:17,797
-Ah you too!

1054
01:22:18,154 --> 01:22:21,132
That's why it happened. Everyone said:

1055
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:23,477
.. "She's not a woman for you".

1056
01:22:23,832 --> 01:22:26,650
-It's not true ? - For his part too, her uncle,

1057
01:22:26,828 --> 01:22:30,534
..the consul who was supposed to say: "He's not a man for you!"

1058
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:33,788
-If you'd listened.
-It's everyone's fault:

1059
01:22:34,163 --> 01:22:36,114
..Gargame, Paulot and you!
-Me ?

1060
01:22:36,449 --> 01:22:40,096
-Yes. When people are happy, others have to spoil everything.

1061
01:22:40,471 --> 01:22:41,952
-She did not wait ..

1062
01:22:42,285 --> 01:22:45,992
..the consul laughed at you. She told you he was a friend.

1063
01:22:46,308 --> 01:22:48,060
She wasn't kidding you?

1064
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:52,854
And the day of the funeral, she had just given you the shamrock.

1065
01:22:53,188 --> 01:22:55,456
I didn't invent it, you told me.

1066
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:58,373
A famous lucky charm this clover!

1067
01:22:59,202 --> 01:23:02,318
At the same time, she said to herself,

1068
01:23:02,653 --> 01:23:03,833
..the consul's wife.

1069
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:05,076
Isn't that true?

1070
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:08,706
-Bah yes, she was pretending! to love me!

1071
01:23:09,021 --> 01:23:12,194
-She must have laughed. -I know, she made me a fool.

1072
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:15,506
My dirty hands she said! -If that's not a whore ..

1073
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,755
If they accuse you, don't weaken.

1074
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,956
You will defend yourself. -Yes, I'll defend myself.

1075
01:23:22,299 --> 01:23:26,298
Yes! They won't get me. I'm telling you: they won't get me.

1076
01:23:36,633 --> 01:23:39,473
-Well Roumagnac, have you changed your mind?

1077
01:23:40,244 --> 01:23:43,718
-You are a funny lawyer. You want me to be guilty.

1078
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:46,421
-But no, I would like to do the best.

1079
01:23:48,258 --> 01:23:51,948
If we could plead guilty I'm sure we would get the minimum.

1080
01:23:52,324 --> 01:23:55,837
-I can't tell you it's not me, since it's not me!

1081
01:23:57,021 --> 01:24:00,613
-You can say that, but you will not have made it easy for me.

1082
01:24:02,901 --> 01:24:06,485
-Ask for The Dispatch! Yes Madam. Thank you Madam.

1083
01:24:06,914 --> 01:24:08,730
The Dispatch! Here Mr.

1084
01:24:09,092 --> 01:24:11,288
-Thank you. -Ask for La Dépêche!

1085
01:24:11,632 --> 01:24:12,881
Ask for La Dépêche!

1086
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,024
Here Mr.

1087
01:24:23,328 --> 01:24:26,818
Ask for La Dépêche! Ask for La Dépêche!

1088
01:24:28,247 --> 01:24:31,676
-Do you think he'll get away with it? -He is very strong.

1089
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:35,466
-One second Mr., I can't serve everyone at the same time.

1090
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:36,997
There it is, thanks.

1091
01:24:40,103 --> 01:24:43,270
- "Mr. Roumagnac persists in denying against the evidence."

1092
01:24:43,452 --> 01:24:46,172
-The evidence ? It remains to prove the obvious.

1093
01:24:46,577 --> 01:24:47,867
-For me, it's proven.

1094
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:51,960
* - Yesterday, victory of the Belgian Vonherbek in the criterium of the road.

1095
01:24:52,262 --> 01:24:55,449
* Today in Clairval, 3rd hearing of the Roumagnac trial.

1096
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:59,017
* The president read a letter from one of the main witnesses,

1097
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,094
* .. Mr. de Laubrie, consul at ..

1098
01:25:01,275 --> 01:25:04,945
* .. Rotterdam, who held back, apologized for not being able to respond to ..

1099
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:08,817
* .. the convocation of justice. The testimony of the forensic scientist.

1100
01:25:08,999 --> 01:25:12,365
* .. was overwhelming for the accused. End of our information.

1101
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:15,631
-Doctor ! Not to mention all their mistakes.

1102
01:25:15,973 --> 01:25:19,079
-She has been strangled. What about the footprints?

1103
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,286
- There is none since everything burned down and she with it.

1104
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,692
-It was necessary to look at the hands of Roumagnac!

1105
01:25:26,015 --> 01:25:29,526
-I've worked with him for 10 years, he's never had 2 cents.

1106
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:30,594
..of nastiness.

1107
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:04,871
-Mrs Percheron, please specify for the jurors, the location.

1108
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:08,076
..from your petrol station.

1109
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:14,527
-It's simple. My post is right at the corner of the main road,

1110
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:17,008
..and the path that leads to the villa.

1111
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,237
-You certify that you saw the Roumagnac car on the day of the crime.

1112
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:22,590
.. leave the road ..

1113
01:26:22,934 --> 01:26:25,959
..and go in the path? -Yes, it's the truth.

1114
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,999
-It's not true.

1115
01:26:26,999 --> 01:26:28,438
I was not at the villa that day.

1116
01:26:28,546 --> 01:26:31,389
-I have nothing against you, I say what is.

1117
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:33,935
-He's in bad shape.

1118
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:37,995
-The witness claimed to have seen Roumagnac's car driving up...

1119
01:26:38,383 --> 01:26:43,446
.. the road to the villa, but did he see that car pass by?

1120
01:26:44,691 --> 01:26:47,629
-Oh no. I had no reason to watch him.

1121
01:26:48,017 --> 01:26:49,772
I have lunch too!

1122
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,386
-Excuse me madam,

1123
01:26:51,754 --> 01:26:55,346
..that day, I did not go to the villa. I'm not saying you're lying

1124
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:58,796
..but you are wrong. How many times have I been there?

1125
01:26:59,141 --> 01:27:01,529
-That's also true. -So !

1126
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,930
-Think well madam.

1127
01:27:04,002 --> 01:27:06,860
Your answer depends on the verdict.

1128
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:10,860
Can you swear it was that day and not the day before?

1129
01:27:11,632 --> 01:27:12,490
-Yes.

1130
01:27:13,998 --> 01:27:14,828
It was surely that day.

1131
01:27:15,766 --> 01:27:19,686
-It is not a question of knowing if it was surely that day, but ..

1132
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,467
..to swear it under the faith of the oath.

1133
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:25,548
-On the oath? Everyone can make mistakes.

1134
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:29,328
- Gentlemen of the jury will appreciate that.

1135
01:27:29,831 --> 01:27:33,369
-You can retire madam. The hearing is adjourned.

1136
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:41,674
-What a mule head! He just said no.

1137
01:27:42,014 --> 01:27:43,872
-If it wasn't him who killed her.

1138
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,119
-So Roumagnac? -He denies of course.

1139
01:27:59,437 --> 01:28:02,018
-In front of the uncle, he will not be able to deny.

1140
01:28:02,358 --> 01:28:05,460
-We don't know where he is. -The deposition of Mrs. Percheron.

1141
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,022
..is clear, she saw Roumagnac.
- Me too, I saw it.

1142
01:28:09,321 --> 01:28:11,602
Not in the same place. I will speak.

1143
01:28:12,782 --> 01:28:16,263
I can tell you that on the day of the crime at 1 p.m.

1144
01:28:16,603 --> 01:28:18,305
..I saw Roumagnac at his place.

1145
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:22,365
He was finishing lunch with his sister,
I even had a drink with them.

1146
01:28:22,707 --> 01:28:25,946
-Mr. Gardin, I don't mean to offend you,

1147
01:28:26,286 --> 01:28:29,906
but you have the reputation of a man who rarely refuses to drink.

1148
01:28:30,267 --> 01:28:32,489
-I protest against these innuendos ..

1149
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:36,270
..who want to weaken the witness.
-I have been drinking for 40 years.

1150
01:28:36,489 --> 01:28:37,892
-It's alcoholism.

1151
01:28:38,191 --> 01:28:41,410
-No, it's not alcoholism, it's a habit.

1152
01:28:43,091 --> 01:28:46,570
-I was never a minute late because of that.

1153
01:28:46,912 --> 01:28:49,313
The day you die,

1154
01:28:49,653 --> 01:28:52,474
..I will drink too. It won't stop me ..

1155
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:56,716
..to distribute your invitations on time, if that worries you.

1156
01:28:59,596 --> 01:29:01,539
-Good boy ! Bravo Gardin!

1157
01:29:03,598 --> 01:29:06,799
-After the funeral, how did you get home?

1158
01:29:07,077 --> 01:29:09,699
-By the bus. -What was your brother doing?

1159
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:11,260
-What was he doing?

1160
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:16,223
-He had not attended the funeral
and claims to have returned home by car.

1161
01:29:16,562 --> 01:29:19,141
So it happened before you returned?

1162
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:21,184
What was he doing ?

1163
01:29:21,462 --> 01:29:23,443
-Yes, he got home before me.

1164
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:26,863
-Yet you don't know what he was doing.

1165
01:29:27,244 --> 01:29:29,224
Your hesitation condemns him.

1166
01:29:29,566 --> 01:29:32,206
-I'm not hesitating, but it's a funny question.

1167
01:29:32,526 --> 01:29:34,648
He was at his construction site, of course.

1168
01:29:34,988 --> 01:29:38,988
-All the workers were at the funeral. The site was not active

1169
01:29:40,169 --> 01:29:44,268
-That was no reason for him not to go!
It's his life.

1170
01:29:44,669 --> 01:29:47,431
I repeat, there has never been a murderer among us.

1171
01:29:47,771 --> 01:29:49,651
-You can withdraw.

1172
01:29:52,093 --> 01:29:55,995
-I want to tell you gentlemen of the jury and even shout at you,

1173
01:29:56,374 --> 01:30:00,654
..that I am completely convinced that Mr. Roumagnac is guilty ..

1174
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:03,175
..of the crime for which he is accused!

1175
01:30:04,797 --> 01:30:08,196
-Why, instead of looking for the criminal among so many people.

1176
01:30:08,537 --> 01:30:11,958
.. ambiguities that were attracted to her, why do you want to ..

1177
01:30:12,299 --> 01:30:15,319
.. to reject the responsibility of the crime on Roumagnac?

1178
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,559
At the time of the crime,

1179
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:20,721
..Roumagnac was having lunch quietly at home.

1180
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:24,261
I will go further: on the day of the crime, Roumagnac got

1181
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:26,860
..gasoline at the dispenser station.

1182
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:30,802
I want to show you there, the best proof of his innocence.

1183
01:30:31,863 --> 01:30:35,947
Here is a man, whose heart is full of sinister designs,

1184
01:30:36,284 --> 01:30:37,707
.. we say. A man,

1185
01:30:37,707 --> 01:30:41,068
.. quivering with murderous rage. Regardless..

1186
01:30:41,349 --> 01:30:43,328
.. to attract attention ..

1187
01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:47,107
..on him, he stops to get gasoline like a tourist!

1188
01:30:47,568 --> 01:30:50,688
Is it plausible? Conceivable? Come on!

1189
01:30:50,868 --> 01:30:54,130
But he would have driven until his last drop of gasoline and ...

1190
01:30:54,432 --> 01:30:57,933
... he would have finished the journey on foot, carried away by hatred,

1191
01:30:58,133 --> 01:31:01,854
..he would have done it by running.
Think of the Roumagnacs you know.

1192
01:31:02,215 --> 01:31:05,693
..for generations! MM. the jurors, strong in agreement.

1193
01:31:06,014 --> 01:31:08,875
..of my conscience, strong in the force of the truth,

1194
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:12,434
..I can not finish better than by quoting the words of the sister ..

1195
01:31:12,776 --> 01:31:16,397
..of the accused: "There were never any assassins among the Roumagnacs!"

1196
01:31:16,736 --> 01:31:22,318
You will acquit M. Roumagnac!

1197
01:31:23,318 --> 01:31:25,361
- Come on, let's see, silence!

1198
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:28,202
What does it mean ?

1199
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,200
Roumagnac.

1200
01:31:30,582 --> 01:31:33,083
Do you want to add anything?

1201
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:35,543
-I have nothing to say, I'm innocent.

1202
01:31:40,805 --> 01:31:41,645
-Ah! Well !

1203
01:31:43,342 --> 01:31:45,042
The uncle of the victim,

1204
01:31:45,236 --> 01:31:48,842
. cited as the main witness for the prosecution
and who did not answer.

1205
01:31:49,161 --> 01:31:51,232
..to our quotes, introduces himself.

1206
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:55,296
-I protest ! The last voice that must be raised here
is that of defence.

1207
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:58,406
However, I have delivered my argument.

1208
01:31:58,703 --> 01:32:02,448
-Yes, but hearing this witness is of capital interest.

1209
01:32:02,648 --> 01:32:04,960
I order that it be done.

1210
01:32:16,353 --> 01:32:19,124
-You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

1211
01:32:19,442 --> 01:32:21,873
..nothing but the truth, raise your right hand,

1212
01:32:22,191 --> 01:32:24,640
.. said: I swear.
-I swear.

1213
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,368
-Why did you not respond to the invitations sent?

1214
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:31,715
-For 5 months, I was between life and death.

1215
01:32:31,993 --> 01:32:34,742
They didn't relieve me until the day before yesterday,

1216
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:38,389
.. when I left the hospital.
- Bring a chair to the witness.

1217
01:32:40,959 --> 01:32:44,226
About 2 hours before the crime, Roumagnac presented himself.

1218
01:32:44,444 --> 01:32:47,471
..to the apartment you occupied with your niece.

1219
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:51,078
He had just left the funeral of one of these workers.

1220
01:32:51,437 --> 01:32:52,254
-And then ?

1221
01:32:52,592 --> 01:32:56,379
It wasn't a crime! My sister told you,
I was at the worksite.

1222
01:32:56,658 --> 01:32:58,948
-It's a suspicious attitude.

1223
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:02,874
Roumagnac seemed to you to be in ..

1224
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:05,881
..a state of particular excitement?

1225
01:33:12,116 --> 01:33:12,934
-No.

1226
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:15,504
I must say that Roumagnac ..

1227
01:33:15,863 --> 01:33:18,752
..didn't give me the impression that he was planning a crime.

1228
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:25,205
-The investigation made in Paris on your niece established that her past ..

1229
01:33:25,523 --> 01:33:27,138
..was quite cloudy.

1230
01:33:27,915 --> 01:33:30,764
-That's the sad truth, Mr. President.

1231
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,743
-You say that now,

1232
01:33:34,088 --> 01:33:36,110
..it made you eat!

1233
01:33:36,471 --> 01:33:39,118
-I let myself be fed but I liked it.

1234
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:43,007
-Funny way to love!
-From Roumagnac moderation.

1235
01:33:43,649 --> 01:33:46,896
Let's see. Dancer in nightclubs, she shot.

1236
01:33:47,237 --> 01:33:49,321
.. his subsistence of companions ..

1237
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,110
.. of orgies or meetings. -It was necessary to live well!

1238
01:33:53,451 --> 01:33:54,694
-How do we get there?

1239
01:33:55,034 --> 01:33:59,262
She was from an excellent family.
-Eh yes ! Sadly,

1240
01:33:59,443 --> 01:34:02,511
..because excellent families have a fad.

1241
01:34:02,852 --> 01:34:06,299
They like young girls to study the arts of entertainment,

1242
01:34:06,499 --> 01:34:10,488
..painting for example.
And in Paris, painting goes through ..

1243
01:34:10,671 --> 01:34:15,582
..Montmartre or Montparnasse.
She goes there and the young girl stays.

1244
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:18,284
..to a café terrace.

1245
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:23,137
This is where we met Blanche and me.

1246
01:34:23,496 --> 01:34:28,351
I was a famous bohemian!
It's even funny how we can change.

1247
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:33,681
I ran the world for 40 years and now I can't sleep anymore.

1248
01:34:33,863 --> 01:34:37,070
..if we only change my place bed.

1249
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,793
- Come on, continue.

1250
01:34:39,494 --> 01:34:43,884
-One evening, in the Latin Quarter, she met Ferrand,

1251
01:34:44,164 --> 01:34:46,249
..the seedman of Clairval.

1252
01:34:47,451 --> 01:34:49,917
At one point, I must admit ...

1253
01:34:51,804 --> 01:34:53,848
There are times like that.

1254
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:58,038
-In plain language,
Ferrand saved her that day and married her.

1255
01:34:58,378 --> 01:35:01,082
Poor naive! -You, please!

1256
01:35:01,666 --> 01:35:04,713
You are not here to smear it, but to defend me.

1257
01:35:05,052 --> 01:35:07,858
It's already painful ...
-For the second time,

1258
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:09,221
..control yourself!

1259
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:12,750
-What do I have to do with the past! My life has started ..

1260
01:35:12,929 --> 01:35:16,458
..the day I met her! So, the past!

1261
01:35:17,339 --> 01:35:21,350
-A man who talks like that, I will never admit that he could ...

1262
01:35:21,709 --> 01:35:23,554
- Come on, that's enough!

1263
01:35:24,076 --> 01:35:27,765
Tell us more about your niece's relationship with ..

1264
01:35:28,086 --> 01:35:30,390
..Mr De Laubrie. -The consul ?

1265
01:35:31,374 --> 01:35:34,779
He wanted to marry her, he offered her his fortune.

1266
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:35,861
-There!

1267
01:35:36,182 --> 01:35:41,113
..the proof of the crime!
You murdered your mistress to

1268
01:35:41,315 --> 01:35:43,820
.. prevent him from joining the consul.

1269
01:35:46,887 --> 01:35:49,554
-Not at all. She wasn't going to join him,

1270
01:35:49,896 --> 01:35:50,956
..Mr. the prosecutor.

1271
01:35:51,338 --> 01:35:53,561
On the contrary, she had broken up.

1272
01:35:53,904 --> 01:35:58,453
..with him because he had engaged in attacks against Roumagnac.

1273
01:35:59,275 --> 01:36:03,226
She even threw a violent insult at him!

1274
01:36:04,187 --> 01:36:07,355
An insult that cost us millions.

1275
01:36:07,673 --> 01:36:10,280
During her lifetime, enough bad words have been said about her.

1276
01:36:10,642 --> 01:36:12,686
It was the truth, alas.

1277
01:36:13,027 --> 01:36:16,573
It is not because she is dead that we should not continue.

1278
01:36:16,913 --> 01:36:18,439
..to tell the truth.

1279
01:36:18,599 --> 01:36:21,986
Especially since it's clean for once.

1280
01:36:22,367 --> 01:36:25,614
If only for the memory.

1281
01:36:25,796 --> 01:36:29,825
-After such a deposition, if I had not delivered my plea,

1282
01:36:30,206 --> 01:36:34,475
..I would give up pronouncing it.
When have we seen a lover kill ...

1283
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:38,564
.. his mistress when the latter has just given him ..

1284
01:36:38,905 --> 01:36:42,011
.. such a beautiful proof of love?
-Vive Roumagnac!

1285
01:36:42,373 --> 01:36:46,421
-Roumagnac is innocent!

1286
01:36:48,286 --> 01:36:52,719
-Unanimously, the jury answered "No" to the 1st question which it ..

1287
01:36:53,078 --> 01:36:53,979
..was asked.

1288
01:37:05,946 --> 01:37:08,432
-Mr. Roumagnac, you are free.

1289
01:37:17,091 --> 01:37:19,535
-Bravo master, that's great.

1290
01:37:44,593 --> 01:37:47,702
-You come ? We're going to the registry. -Yes.

1291
01:37:53,912 --> 01:37:55,278
-He! Here is the wine!

1292
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,886
-Well done !
-When there's more, there's more.

1293
01:37:59,366 --> 01:38:03,757
-Martin must be released.
- There is still justice.

1294
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:07,666
- My poor Jeanne, you've had some hard times.

1295
01:38:08,006 --> 01:38:11,836
-Yes, don't think about it anymore.
He is going to feast, I made him truffles.

1296
01:38:11,836 --> 01:38:14,621
It's been a long time since he ate it.

1297
01:38:14,621 --> 01:38:18,350
- Fortunately, there is your testimony.
-I told the truth.

1298
01:38:18,691 --> 01:38:21,680
I said to the prosecutor: "When I got here,

1299
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,402
"..it was sharp 1 p.m."

1300
01:38:23,743 --> 01:38:26,109
-Bravo, bravo! -I have the dispatches!

1301
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:29,297
Who wants the dispatches?
Special edition !

1302
01:38:30,859 --> 01:38:34,968
-Who wants fresh news? Ask for La Dépêche!

1303
01:38:35,487 --> 01:38:37,192
-Me ! - I have more.

1304
01:38:37,573 --> 01:38:39,437
-We say what ? Read aloud.

1305
01:38:39,777 --> 01:38:42,907
- "Martin Roumagnac freed."

1306
01:38:43,226 --> 01:38:44,508
-Here they are !

1307
01:38:46,856 --> 01:38:48,240
-There's Martin!

1308
01:38:54,894 --> 01:38:56,917
-Bravo Martin. I am happy.

1309
01:38:57,257 --> 01:38:59,463
Its nice to see you again.

1310
01:38:59,645 --> 01:39:01,587
- I can't even kiss him.

1311
01:39:02,048 --> 01:39:04,996
It's over, you're with us.
You have to forget now.

1312
01:39:05,196 --> 01:39:07,300
-We will drink to that.
-He is right.

1313
01:39:07,763 --> 01:39:10,129
It's nice to be home.

1314
01:39:10,489 --> 01:39:12,514
-What did he say ?
He didn't say a word.

1315
01:39:12,835 --> 01:39:15,581
-What do you want him to say?
It is the emotion.

1316
01:39:15,922 --> 01:39:18,065
-Come on, yours! -Cheers !

1317
01:39:18,386 --> 01:39:21,594
-You showed them what a Roumagnac is.

1318
01:39:21,915 --> 01:39:25,122
-Shake yourself!
-Read this: "Roumagnac, freed."

1319
01:39:25,382 --> 01:39:29,072
- Let's drink to the health of the prosecutor.
-He would have had him condemned ..

1320
01:39:29,453 --> 01:39:32,158
..for that hen.
- Shut up all of you!

1321
01:39:32,539 --> 01:39:33,761
Give me a break !

1322
01:39:34,963 --> 01:39:36,387
-But what's wrong with him?

1323
01:39:36,587 --> 01:39:38,573
-Speak !
-Calm down.

1324
01:39:38,913 --> 01:39:42,141
-People who talk around me, it doesn't stop.

1325
01:39:42,321 --> 01:39:45,389
Everyone needs to talk and no one knows anything!

1326
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:48,955
They all talk about what they don't know!

1327
01:39:54,546 --> 01:39:57,012
-It's the nerves. Don't blame him.

1328
01:39:57,335 --> 01:39:59,399
-It's best to leave it.

1329
01:40:01,606 --> 01:40:04,029
When he has slept, he will be better.

1330
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:07,619
- Am I taking you on my motorbike?
-Yes, but watch out for the bends.

1331
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:28,267
- Shall we drink?
- To the health of Roumagnac!

1332
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:31,290
-See you soon. -Bye.

1333
01:40:33,176 --> 01:40:34,037
Good evening.

1334
01:40:35,901 --> 01:40:37,445
-You no longer embarrass yourself!

1335
01:40:39,972 --> 01:40:42,221
-She doesn't start the first time.

1336
01:42:17,385 --> 01:42:19,374
-Oh, Martin!

1337
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:24,456
-Good evening Jeanne. - Let him rest.

1338
01:42:24,456 --> 01:42:27,438
Life is good now, don't worry.

1339
01:42:40,781 --> 01:42:44,792
-Martin, your friends say goodbye to you.
