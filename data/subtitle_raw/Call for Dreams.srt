1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,720
Is the dreamer dreaming the dream?

2
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,440
Or is the dream dreaming the dreamer?

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,520
Next message.

4
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Hello.

5
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Hello.

6
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,800
I would like to advertise an ad in your newspaper.

7
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,520
How much does it cost?

8
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,080
We have a few options.

9
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,440
The price depends on the size and location.

10
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,600
A big ad, small, medium, color or black and white.

11
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I see,

12
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
I want it to appear for one week starting this friday.

13
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,120
A small black and white ad at the bottom left corner.

14
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,800
I got it.

15
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,520
What's the content of the ad?

16
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,760
Call for Dreams.

17
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,280
Ok.

18
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,920
Call for Dreams.

19
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,560
Anything else?

20
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,080
Yes yes.

21
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,880
Please write,

22
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
Looking for dreams,

23
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
I might get back to you,

24
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,200
Send me your description of a dream and contact,

25
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,440
Privacy guaranteed.

26
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,640
Not for sexual purposes.

27
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,640
That's all.

28
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,040
Fine.

29
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,880
It will cost 85'000 yen

30
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,120
and it will be ready by tomorrow evening.

31
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,040
All the best.

32
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,960
Thanks.

33
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,320
Call for Dreams.

34
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Please leave your contact and message,

35
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,680
and maybe I'll get back to you.

36
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,120
You have one new message.

37
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,360
I dream of shooting,

38
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,360
Someone.

39
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,080
Four bullets.

40
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,320
Hi. Long time no see.

41
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
Come in.

42
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,960
Is it raining?

43
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Yes, its a little rainy.

44
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm just making ozoni soup,

45
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,680
Want to eat together? Ill help you.

46
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,720
Rice cake?

47
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Tasty.

48
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

49
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,360
So,

50
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
whats going on with you lately?

51
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,840
Nothing special,

52
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't have much work now.

53
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,120
How's health?

54
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,320
Health is good.

55
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,720
You loved to read books once, are you reading now?

56
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,640
I don't have too much time for that now.

57
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,880
I see

58
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Look at the rice cake.

59
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,400
Yes.

60
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,880
Is it true that some people choke to death from it?

61
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,320
Especially old people.

62
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
Strange food.

63
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
You eat fast.

64
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
It still hurts a little.

65
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,080
I could feel when it went off.

66
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,120
You have one new message.

67
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,120
Im walking with my twin sister,

68
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
in an airport.

69
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,640
We slowly approach an aircraft.

70
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,000
Someone pushes me.

71
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,120
I fall next to a lady I don't know.

72
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,680
Our skins touch, it makes me shiver.

73
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,640
I keep quiet,

74
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,520
and look at her legs.

75
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,360
Orange nail polish,

76
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,800
and a skull tattoo.

77
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,240
A stewardess starts demonstrating safety instructions.

78
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
The plane fills with fog.

79
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,600
My number,

80
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
03

81
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
56

82
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,160
67

83
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,560
1925

84
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,960
Address,

85
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,320
Akihabara.

86
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,520
5-26

87
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,240
Please come today if possible.

88
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,760
Dream number 972.

89
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,240
Relieved a little bit.

90
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,000
I found interesting facts about the rain.

91
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,560
Feeling nausea and revolt.

92
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,880
Woke up at 5am again.

93
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,160
In the dark silky rain

94
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,600
calling birds but they're not coming.

95
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,000
Darkness makes me nervous.

96
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,080
Looking at my arms, bleeding

97
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,040
bright blood, almost white.

98
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Feeling powerless.

99
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,560
My sight narrows gradually.

100
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,720
I close my eyes.

101
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,120
Ladies and gentlemen I’m your flight attendant today, my name is Eko.

102
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,160
To release your seat belt, press the buckle.

103
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,000
Your seat belt must remain tight in case of tremors.

104
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,360
There are 4 emergency exits,

105
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,560
in the front and back,

106
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,160
and two in the middle.

107
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Pull the life vest from under your seat

108
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,160
pull down the strap,

109
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,200
and blow air through the hose.

110
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,880
In case of lack of oxygen, air masks will drop down.

111
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,360
Stay seated and pull the masks towards you.

112
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,400
Cover your nose and mouth and breath normally.

113
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,880
In order to keep air clean and fresh,

114
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,440
this is a non smoking flight.

115
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,880
Good evening, welcome, how are you?

116
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,320
A little tired.

117
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,280
I was a stewardess today.

118
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,360
Look.

119
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,720
Where do you have Pachinko from? (luck machines)

120
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,360
Oh, from Youtube.

121
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
You probably want the small dish.

122
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,560
You're the only one that orders it.

123
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,320
Always been this way?

124
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,960
Yes.

125
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,160
Yes.

126
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
Thanks for waiting, please.

127
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,920
When I was your age,

128
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,520
life was much simpler.

129
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,360
There were only four channels on TV.

130
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,720
Yes.

131
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,720
Today things are not what they seem.

132
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,760
What's that, are you recording?

133
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,720
The tape recorder is like a confession machine.

134
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,040
Every act of recording,

135
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,240
transforms the present into a memory.

136
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,920
I see.

137
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,440
Every copy,

138
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,440
by copying,

139
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,440
the present dissolves into the past.

140
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,800
People want to re-invent themselves differently.

141
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,280
To remember events, not necessarily in the way they happened.

142
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,440
A recording is an opportunity for change.

143
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,520
When will you find something real to do?

144
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,240
There is no ׳real׳ anymore.

145
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,160
You choose to act in a reality of your choice.

146
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,080
It looks empty today.

147
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,760
Yes, a lot of spare time.

148
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Maybe tomorrow will be better.

149
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
Maybe tomorrow will be better.

150
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,160
Have you ever thought what dictates our notion of time?

151
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,920
It's the rhythm of our breath, undoubtedly.

152
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,120
In which dimension could this rhythm disappear?

153
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,040
Which dimension would be revealed?

154
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,360
Excuse me?

155
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,680
Is anyone here?

156
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,960

Call for Dreams.

172

Please leave your contact and message.

173
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,240
Please leave your contact and message.

174
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,200
and maybe I'll get back to you.

175
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,120
Call for Dreams.

176
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,520
Please leave your contact and message.

177
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
and maybe I'll get back to you.

178
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,760
One new message.

179
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,920
I have two dreams that are somehow connected.

180
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,680
Im in an office arguing with a Japanese lady.

181
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,160
Suddenly I shoot her.

182
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,440
Ill tell you the second dream after you dance.

183
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,200
Ladies and gentlemen my name is..

184
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,320
Excuse me.

185
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,520
Where the boys are,

186
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,240
someone waits for me

187
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,440
A smiling face

188
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,640
a warm embrace

189
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,520
two arms to hold me tenderly

190
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,160
Where the boys are

191
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:01,000
my true love will be

192
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,920
He's walkin' down some street in town

193
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,360
and I know he's lookin' there for me

194
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:24,640
In the crowd of a million people I'll find my valentine

195
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:33,640
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple

196
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,640
and tell the world he's mine

197
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:51,760
Till he holds me I'll wait impatiently

198
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,520
Where the boys are, where the boys are

199
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:05,280
Where the boys are, someone waits for me

200
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,160
Till he holds me

201
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:17,040
I'll wait impatiently

202
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,720
Where the boys are, where the boys are

203
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:36,200
Where the boys are, someone waits for me

204
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,400
The second dream starts with balconies.

205
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,320
Different types of balconies.

206
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,560
I'm standing on a balcony.

207
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,240
My face is black.

208
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm changing faces.

209
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,880
My car strolls into a deserted hotel.

210
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,680
On a summer day.

211
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,920
The song ׳Where The Boys Are׳ by Connie Francis is playing on the radio.

212
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,280
My daughter keeps on hiding from me.

213
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,640
Changing faces.

214
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,640
Her name was Eko.

215
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,640
She was found dead in that deserted hotel.

216
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,800
Just lying there in a ruined game arcade.

217
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,560
I can remember every detail.

218
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,760
What I don't understand,

219
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,080
is why she resembles the Japanese lady from the first dream.

220
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,560
I'm also spreading on the dirty floor.

221
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,440
Wounded.

222
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,960
Time passes like a burning car.

223
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,080
I'm useless.

224
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,360
I can only move an ear.

225
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,880
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

226
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,240
Can such a thing exist?

227
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,040
A reality parallel to this one.

228
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,360
As if we have a copy,

229
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,200
existing in parallel in another world.

230
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,240
Every page has four corners,

231
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,720
every sheet of paper can rip and rejoin differently.

232
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,080
The first sentences that you think of,

233
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,920
will be the ones that define you.

234
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,960
After you write, you rip the paper

235
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,680
and pass it over to me, one by one in separate.

236
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
You come and sit down.

237
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,400
A waitress will come to you,

238
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,720
and offer different cocktails.

239
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,360
You will ask for a "White Russian".

240
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,040
It's very important that you ask just for that.

241
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,000
Then make one phone call to this number.

242
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,920
Wait for a red light to blink in my ear.

243
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,040
At 22:22, the location:

244
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,920
The Pink Fish club in Shibuya.

245
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,240
And bring this tape recording.

246
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,840
Next message.

247
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,280
The Pink Fish Club

248
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,160
Its me.

249
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,080
I know.

250
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,120
I invited "Call For Dreams" here,

251
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,080
and got the disk with your video files from the security cam,

252
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,880
Like you wanted.

253
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,560
The Pink Fish Club

254
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,160
Welcome.

255
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,360
Do you want to order something?

256
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,600
What do you recommend?

257
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,240
This is a cocktail bar,

258
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,480
there are many choices, our recommendation,

259
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,800
Earthquake,

260
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,920
Corpse Reviver,

261
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,840
Red Lotus,

262
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,480
Black Russian.

263
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,280
Do you have a White Russian?

264
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,880
Yes we do.

265
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,600
So yes please.

266
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
With pleasure.

267
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,600
Nothing seemed to matter anymore.

268
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,720
But then again, everything did.

269
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,120
The moment you look at something, it changes.

270
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,240
You will wake up now and remember nothing.

271
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,640
You can keep the briefcase.

272
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,600
This is what I call sweet dreams.

273
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,560
Floor 44.

274
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,280
I have no idea what you’re up to,

275
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,600
But what you asked for is here.

276
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,040
Inside this briefcase.

277
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,200
Give him.

278
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,080
Are you coming?

279
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,520
Goodbye.

280
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,720
Entry is not allowed here.

281
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,200
How did you get in?

282
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,160
Wait a moment please.

283
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,680
One to four,

284
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:02,800
Stop.

285
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,880
There is a trespasser.

286
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,920
Tunnel 8 section 3.

287
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,520
Dispatch security urgently.

288
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,080
I'm extremely terrified,

289
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,000
but I've never felt calmer.

290
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,400
People with armor are chasing me.

291
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,920
Lurking in the shadows.

292
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,440
I lay down on the grass,

293
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,400
watching them find me.

294
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,760
And I walk through a huge condensed urban forest,

295
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,360
with swarms of birds,

296
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,000
and a big orange full moon.

297
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,440
There is snow everywhere.

298
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,120
Snow is falling from the night sky.

299
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,400
But its summertime.

300
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,840
Police shalom. Some of the calls are recorded.

301
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,000
If you have an extension number, press it now.

302
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,240
What's up?

303
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,720
Ok, where are you?

304
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,280
On the way, why?

305
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
If no one told you,

306
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,080
We've taken the Tokyo guy for more questioning.

307
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:04,920
What's up?

308
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:05,880
Ok.

309
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,080
Look,

310
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,400
all he is saying is that he was deported from Tokyo

311
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,160
and that he doesn’t know whats in the briefcase.

312
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,080
He has no prior records or finger prints anywhere.

313
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,720
A ghost.

314
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,960
Keep an eye.

315
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,720
Sit.

316
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,800
Do you know why you're here?

317
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,680
I have no idea.

318
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,200
You don't have an idea ha?

319
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,040
No one explained to you?

320
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,360
Look,

321
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,400
we have nothing on you.

322
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,920
In the briefcase that was with you when you were arrested,

323
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,440
we found a newspaper from 3 days ago in Japanese,

324
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,040
a cassette,

325
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,880
a pepper shredder,

326
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,000
and a disk with video files, where you appear.

327
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,640
Lets start with you telling me your name.

328
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,880
I understand.

329
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,400
Look.

330
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,280
You can play dumb and be silent,

331
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,040
but it won't help you.

332
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,920
So you have two options.

333
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,040
Cooperate with me and we finish quickly and leave.

334
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,080
At least I will.

335
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,240
Or we can have the long and exhausting version.

336
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,160
What's this?

337
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,320
I have no idea.

338
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,280
Then I'll tell you.

339
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,760
Allenbi street in Tel Aviv.

340
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,760
Sunday night.

341
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,000
So?

342
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,440
So where were you last sunday night for example?

343
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,640
Not in Allenbi.

344
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,200
Are you sure?

345
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,600
Do you have witnesses?

346
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,200
We sharpened this frame.

347
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,760
I would be worried if I were you.

348
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,720
Maybe you'll sharpen your memories?

349
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,480
It's not possible, thats the truth.

350
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,120
And I don't have anyway to prove it to you,

351
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,200
only fragments.

352
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,760
Fragments are good.

353
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,680
Hello.

354
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,160
Listen, they called from the lab about the shreds of paper

355
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,800
from the pepper grinder found in his briefcase.

356
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,480
It seems the shreds are from a few notes,

357
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,880
in a woman's handwriting.

358
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,680
Im sending the result to your mobile soon.

359
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:08,840
Good.

360
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,960
How much longer will this take?

361
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,280
As long as needed.

362
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,400
You will wake up now and remember nothing.

363
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,440
This might sound strange to you,

364
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,440
but this video you are showing me,

365
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,400
where I supposedly shoot a girl,

366
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,400
I dreamed about it.

367
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,440
Yesterday.

368
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,120
Is anyone here?

369
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,640
You don't have a name.

370
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,120
You don't have an ID.

371
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,400
You're nothing.

372
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,200
As far as I'm concerned you don't exist.

373
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,360
And I'm not talking to you.

374
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,160
How can I be talking to someone who doesn't exist?

375
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,840
Right?

376
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,120
You have one new message.

377
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,320
Is the dreamer dreaming the dream?
