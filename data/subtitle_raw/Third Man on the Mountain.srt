1
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,822
<i>Rudi!</i>

2
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,721
Dreaming again?

3
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:51,135
That's four plates, three cups
and a platter so far this week.

4
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,672
You're breaking your own record, boy.

5
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,073
If it didn't make it too dark,
I'd put a blind up over that window.

6
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,043
And hurry up over those dishes,

7
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,809
or the water'll be cold
and the dishes covered in grease.

8
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,781
Every day it's the same thing.
Never any time to do anything properly.

9
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,824
This is your job, you know.
You should be doing this.

10
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,985
Oh, no! You'll have me
doing the washing-up next.

11
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,121
Almost time for the tourists
to be back from their morning climb,

12
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,860
hungry as wolves and harder to please.

13
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,129
If only their climbing
were as good as their appetites,

14
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,172
the Citadel would've been climbed
100 times by now.

15
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,673
No. All they do
is to come out here to eat.

16
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,834
I wonder if they're as particular at home?

17
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,676
This one wants no garlic,
this one wants something else.

18
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,012
The rest of them
want whatever we haven't got.

19
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,053
Rudi! You'll have to go and get me
a bag of carrots.

20
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,714
Huh? Where is he?

21
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,248
- Rudi!
- Mmm, something smells good.

22
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,553
Something smells.

23
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,292
Where is he?

24
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,566
He's just passing
Frau Gertz's back garden.

25
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,710
Her dog always barks at Rudi.

26
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,742
I felt he'd go today. I felt it
from the moment I woke up this morning.

27
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:19,155
- Then why didn't you stop him?
- Stop him? Oh, Teo!

28
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:24,289
- Would you try and bottle up the wind?
- Now, what kind of crazy talk is that?

29
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,323
Is that what I'm to tell your father
when he finds out the boy's gone again?

30
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,336
No, but you'll think of something.

31
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,395
Yes. The truth!

32
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,964
You wait. This time, you'll see.

33
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,201
Bottle the wind!
I'll bottle the wind for him.

34
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,482
I thought so. I saw him from the window.

35
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,042
What if you did?
The boy's gone home. His mother's sick.

36
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,284
- Don't bite my head off.
- Are the tables set? Sugar bowls filled?

37
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,224
- Have you time to waste?
- Well, I...

38
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,283
Ooh!

39
00:04:55,361 --> 00:05:00,731
Oh, Teo, practice shows.
You're such a beautiful liar.

40
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,859
I would have stammered and stuttered.

41
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,371
I was saving my own skin. I'm supposed
to be in charge of the young rascal.

42
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,602
Now, leave me alone. I've got work to do.

43
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,235
- He must be almost at the high meadow.
- Will you kindly go someplace else?

44
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,980
It isn't fitting for the proprietor's daughter
always to be hanging round the kitchen.

45
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,649
Do you remember when the three of us
would go to the Felsberg on your day off?

46
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,387
We'd take lunches and you'd teach Rudi.

47
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,919
Yes, well, those days
are over and finished.

48
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,164
I promised never to mention the mountains
to Rudi again.

49
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,964
And I'm a man of my word.

50
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,084
Monte D'Oro.

51
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,485
Wunderhorn.

52
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,429
And you.

53
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,159
And you!

54
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,893
<i>Hello!</i>

55
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,166
And you!

56
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,444
Hello!

57
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,882
Hello!

58
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,487
Help!

59
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,535
Hello.

60
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,301
Hello!

61
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,819
Help!

62
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,975
Hello.

63
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,877
Hello?

64
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,879
Hello!

65
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,019
Hold on. I'll get you out.

66
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,313
Is that all the rope you've got?

67
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,875
Yes, but I'll think of something.

68
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,114
Right.

69
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,479
Keep moving. You must keep moving.

70
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,609
Get on your feet.

71
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,821
I'll be all right.
Just let me get my breath.

72
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,986
- Why, you're only a boy!
- Don't try to talk, sir.

73
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,297
- How did you get up here at all?
- I come up here all the time. It's nothing.

74
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,338
Nothing? You only saved my life.

75
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,141
- There must be a mistake.
- Why?

76
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,514
I couldn't have saved your life.
You're Captain Winter.

77
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,110
That's right. There's no mistake.

78
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,281
But how could you
have fallen down a crevasse?

79
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:09,191
Because I was too busy looking up at a
mountain to see what was at my own feet.

80
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,230
- That mountain?
- Yes.

81
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,527
That mountain.

82
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,202
Tell me, why are you so interested
in that mountain?

83
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,543
My father was killed on it.

84
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,948
Your father? What's your name?

85
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:37,011
- Rudi Matt.
- Son of Josef Matt!

86
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,081
- Yes, sir.
- I might have known.

87
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,870
What do you think, Rudi?
Can it be climbed?

88
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,136
- The Citadel?
- Your father thought so.

89
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,178
Of all the guides in Switzerland,
he was the only one who thought so.

90
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,874
So do I.

91
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,042
Is that why you're in Kurtal?
You're going to try to climb the Citadel?

92
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,018
It's not as simple as that.

93
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:12,490
There isn't a guide in the whole
of Kurtal would go with me.

94
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:17,928
- I could talk to my uncle, Franz Lerner?
- I spoke to him. He wants no part of it.

95
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:22,058
Any other peak, any other venture.
But not the Citadel.

96
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,307
Perhaps I'll go over to the next valley,
over to Broli.

97
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,006
- There's a guide there named Saxo.
- Emil Saxo?

98
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,017
Yes. But first I mean to reconnoiter
some more, pick a route.

99
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,950
If there is a route.

100
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,489
There is a route.

101
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,492
What makes you think so?
No one else does.

102
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,360
Because I want to.
I believe the story Old Teo tells.

103
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,866
- Old Teo?
- The other guide who was with my father.

104
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,663
What does Old Teo say?

105
00:13:56,735 --> 00:14:00,262
On that last day,
Sir Edward and Teo waited on a ledge,

106
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,241
while my father went on by himself.

107
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,112
When he came back, there was
a strange, excited look on his face.

108
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,116
But before he could tell them
what he'd found,

109
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,520
the avalanche swept them
down the mountain.

110
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,254
Sir Edward was injured and my father
stayed with him while Teo went for help.

111
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,762
I know the rest, Rudi.

112
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,630
Your father took his jacket and sweater
and wrapped them around Sir Edward.

113
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:33,502
And at the last, his shirt, sir.
He covered him with his red shirt.

114
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,768
I'd like to have known him, Rudi.

115
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,947
Good evening, ladies.

116
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,285
- Have you had a good time, gentlemen?
- Very exciting. Magnificent view.

117
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,790
It gives you a wonderful appetite.

118
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,918
- A fine dinner awaits you.
- Thank you.

119
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,066
Americans, Lizbeth!
The world is coming to my hotel.

120
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,398
Oh, I mistook them for English.

121
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,906
They would happily have paid 20 Francs
instead of 10.

122
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,447
Now, can you assure us
that we have everything we need?

123
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,280
Oh, yes, ma'am. But perhaps
you could use a good porter?

124
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,616
Well, then, meet us at the hotel at 10:30.

125
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,747
Certainly, ma'am.

126
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,750
Certainly, ma'am.

127
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,809
- Who are you looking for? I'm back.
- Were you away?

128
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,006
Say, choral group tonight.
I'd be pleased to take you.

129
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,238
But thank you.

130
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,842
You'd be better off with me
than that plate scraper.

131
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,915
Oh, you worry about me too much, Klaus.
Rudi hasn't invited me yet.

132
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,516
But if he should...

133
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,821
Hey, Lizbeth, wait.

134
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,859
Good evening, Herr Lerner.

135
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:14,463
I hear the great Captain Winter's in Kurtal,
asking questions about the Citadel.

136
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,239
- Every man has his weakness.
- Yes, and it's usually in his head.

137
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,621
Franz is coming this way.
What are you going to tell him?

138
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,558
You need practice. You tell him something.

139
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,193
- Evening, Lizbeth.
- Evening, Herr Lerner.

140
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,258
Teo. Where's the boy? Evening, Gretchen.

141
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,804
- You mean Rudi?
- Who else?

142
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,899
Well, as you can see, he isn't here.
I sent him on an errand.

143
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,845
Everything all right, then?
Behaving himself?

144
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,403
Oh, well enough.

145
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,178
I just thought I'd drop in.

146
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:05,456
Herr Lerner, will you tell your sister
I'm sorry she's sick?

147
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,261
- Who said my sister was sick?
- Didn't you say so?

148
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,791
- Isn't that why Rudi...
- You interfering little...!

149
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,894
So, it's that again!

150
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,532
And you, Teo,
encouraging and defending him.

151
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,907
- One lie piled on top of another.
- I always lie to nosy women.

152
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,141
- You lied to me.
- Who are you to expect privileges?

153
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,514
Oh, Teo, Herr Lerner, so much bother
about a few unwashed dishes.

154
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,112
It's a question of principle.
This is where the boy works.

155
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:42,024
Why do you always call him "the boy"
as if he were a piece of furniture?

156
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,654
Because he is a boy
and this is where he belongs.

157
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,290
- Because you say so?
- You agreed to keep out of this.

158
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:52,326
I have, and I intend to.
But it'll all be the same in the end.

159
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,770
It isn't in the Matt blood
to be locked up in a kitchen.

160
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,274
One day that blood's going to boil up,

161
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:01,142
and you won't be able to stop it any more
than you can... How did you say it?

162
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,477
Any more than you can bottle up the wind.

163
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,576
Bottle up the wind? There's something
going on behind my back.

164
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:13,785
Now, stop roaring! Do you want Herr
Hempel to think I'm stewing a live bull?

165
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,896
Tell me, what are you in the village, Rudi?
An apprentice guide?

166
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,768
- No, sir.
- What, then?

167
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,833
- I'm a dishwasher.
- The son of Josef Matt?

168
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,481
I take the path, sir,

169
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,857
but first I must ask you a favor.

170
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,862
Will you not tell anyone you saw me?

171
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,060
Not tell anyone? After what happened
today? Why, you're too modest, Rudi.

172
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,538
Please, sir. If my mother and uncle knew,
I would be in great trouble.

173
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,906
- All right, I'll see you don't get into trouble.
- Thank you.

174
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,950
You know, Franz,
perhaps if you spoke to Herr Hempel,

175
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,853
Rudi could work in another part
of the hotel, away from Old Teo.

176
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,222
What's the good? There'd still be Lizbeth.

177
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:25,024
Mm. It's been on my mind
to speak to Lizbeth.

178
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,464
And risk offending Herr Hempel? No, llse.

179
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,092
Leave her out of it.

180
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:39,007
Summer will come, the boy will go to
Zürich for his training in the business.

181
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,274
There he'll learn there's another world
beyond the mountains,

182
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,407
forget this stubborn dream
of being a guide.

183
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,976
It's like a disease. A curse.

184
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,046
As if that wicked mountain wanted him, too.

185
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,424
Stop thinking like that, llse.
It'll all work out.

186
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,723
Let me handle him.

187
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,572
I guess I'm late.

188
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,304
It was very busy at the hotel... today.

189
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,738
There were a lot of dishes.

190
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,716
Yes. I saw them.

191
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,348
I also listened to a lot of lies.
Enough for one day.

192
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,154
I don't want to hear any more.

193
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,924
After giving your word, Rudi. Why?

194
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,999
I don't know.

195
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:41,231
- You don't know?
- I mean I didn't plan it that way.

196
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,299
But from the kitchen,
I could see the sun on the mountains.

197
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:50,076
The sun on the mountains, but not
the future you can have with Herr Hempel.

198
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:54,141
- He's so interested in you.
- But I didn't ask him to be interested in me.

199
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,154
No, it was handed to you
on a silver platter.

200
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,623
And not because of you,
but because of who you are.

201
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:05,595
Your father brought tourists to Kurtal,
climbers from all over the world.

202
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,690
- To him Herr Hempel owes his hotel.
- Don't you see, Rudi?

203
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,930
You have a chance to go farther
than any boy in the village.

204
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,462
Some day you might even be the proprietor
of the Monte D'Oro Hotel.

205
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,137
Can't you see how much better your life
will be than climbing on rocks and ice?

206
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,046
- No.
- Look at me, Rudi.

207
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,314
For 20 years I've been a guide.
One of the best.

208
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,878
Where's it got me?

209
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,653
I haven't saved enough money
to buy a dozen cows.

210
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,718
And look what being a guide
did for Old Teo.

211
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,356
Crippled. Touched in the head.

212
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:44,630
No matter what you say, he's still
climbed higher than any man in Kurtal.

213
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,171
- He's the only man alive who...
- Rudi.

214
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,869
That's right. Stop and think for a moment
of somebody else.

215
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:57,381
You could make up to your mother
for a little of what she's suffered.

216
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,242
- Where are you going, Rudi?
- Back to the hotel to finish the dishes.

217
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,353
Captain Winter!

218
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,520
My apologies, Franz.
I looked for you in the village.

219
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:14,053
Apologies, Captain?
It's an honor for me and my sister.

220
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,293
The honor is mine
to meet the widow of Josef Matt.

221
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,098
- And this is her son, Rudi.
- Hello.

222
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,934
Won't you be seated, Captain?

223
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,067
I just wanted to see if you'd be
available for a climb in the morning.

224
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,940
Of course.

225
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,809
That is, if you don't mean...

226
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,839
No, not the Citadel. I was thinking of
the Wunderhorn. I hear it's a good climb.

227
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,854
- That's true, and it's a fine view.
- It's the view that interests me.

228
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:41,018
We'd leave about noon, spend the night
at the hut and go up the next morning.

229
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,960
That would mean food and blankets
and probably a porter.

230
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,090
By all means a porter.
What about Rudi here?

231
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,203
The boy works elsewhere,
but I'll find a good man.

232
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,239
Please, Uncle. Just this once?

233
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,867
- Have you forgotten already?
- But this is different.

234
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,604
- To go with Captain Winter.
- Enough!

235
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,839
Rudi, what foolishness is this?

236
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,404
Even if I said yes, you couldn't do it.

237
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:09,216
But I could. Captain Winter knows
I could. That's why he asked for me.

238
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,053
When did Captain Winter
set eyes on you before?

239
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,820
It seems our secret is out, Rudi.

240
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,920
Rudi and I met on the glacier
this afternoon.

241
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:23,058
- And he told you he was a porter?
- No, no.

242
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,333
But it's my pleasure to tell you that
this afternoon, this boy saved my life.

243
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,683
Woof, woof, woof, yourself!

244
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,070
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost what little mind you had?

245
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,842
Yes. I mean, no. Wait till you hear.
Tomorrow, I go to the Wunderhorn.

246
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,110
- Rudi!
- He must have hit his head.

247
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,551
- As porter to the great Captain Winter.
- He has hit his head.

248
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,054
I told you they couldn't stop him.
He's running away.

249
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,091
Not this time. My mother and uncle
have given permission.

250
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,786
I've talked to Tony Bassler.
He'll do the dishes for me.

251
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,490
So they've finally given in.
He's going to be a guide after all.

252
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:30,763
Well, just for tomorrow,
and only because of Captain Winter.

253
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,896
But it'd be worth it
if it was the last day of my life.

254
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,236
It may very well be. Now, you calm down.

255
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,709
Remember,
you've never climbed with a party before.

256
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,746
Who was it used to go
to the practice mountain with us?

257
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,147
Some grumpy old man. I can just hear him.

258
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,951
One foot slowly, then the other.

259
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,820
- Up we go.
- Stay off my cupboard.

260
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,326
Feel for your hold.

261
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,589
A three-legged cow
could do better than you.

262
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,461
All right, break your necks.

263
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,627
Lean back, stop hugging the rock.

264
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,929
Lizbeth, where are you?

265
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:15,512
- What goes on here?
- We just fell off the Wunderhorn.

266
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,741
In your night clothes?

267
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,307
Get back to your room, Lizbeth.

268
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,415
From Captain Winter. For you.

269
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,483
- Important, he says.
- He's changed his mind.

270
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,321
What does he say?

271
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,697
Read the last part. I want Teo to hear it.

272
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,502
"Only a small token
of admiration and gratitude

273
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:47,238
of your friend and fellow climber,
John Winter. "

274
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,562
- What can I do for you, boy?
- I have a note, sir.

275
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,567
Oh, good day, miss.

276
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:15,265
Herr Burgener hasn't got his spectacles
and we're in a great hurry.

277
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,036
This is what it says.

278
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,541
"Dear Rudi, if you will go
to Alex Burgener's shop,

279
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,583
you will find ordered for you
some things that may be useful. "

280
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,175
"They are only a small token
of admiration and gratitude

281
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,654
of your friend and fellow climber,
John Winter. "

282
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,652
Rudi!

283
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,498
There you are.

284
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,372
But are you sure, sir?
These boots, they're the best.

285
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,934
The very best. Captain Winter himself
has been in. They're what he ordered.

286
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:58,039
Now, I suggest you try 'em on, tramp
around for an hour or so, break 'em in.

287
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:11,820
Why was there never a rich Englishman
waiting for me in a crevasse?

288
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,059
But for a guide,
he's not too strongly built.

289
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,729
Neither was his father. It's good to see
another Matt going into the mountains.

290
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,830
Morning, Klaus. Nice day for a walk.

291
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,440
- Good day to you, Franz.
- Captain.

292
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,584
To keep you safe.

293
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,056
Come on, Rudi.

294
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:37,581
Well, Rudi, this is a bit different from
roaming the hills like a mountain goat.

295
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,888
Well done, Rudi.

296
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,891
It seems we're not alone.

297
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,867
No, Johann Fieniger
brought up a party this morning.

298
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,803
Some of your countrymen.
Also a Frenchman and an Italian.

299
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,602
Well, the evening won't be dull.

300
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,314
My friend, if you really want some sport,
you should come to my country.

301
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:51,845
- All the best climbs are in Italy.
- How many times have I got to tell you?

302
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,356
That's all for you tonight.

303
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,257
Forever back in history, Frenchmen
have been climbing mountains.

304
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,420
Long before history told of Frenchmen,

305
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,363
my ancestors, the Romans,
they were at home in the Alps.

306
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,959
Why dwell on past glory
when we have with us the present?

307
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:09,700
Gentlemen, I give you John Winter,
conqueror of 50 mountains.

308
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,607
And by coincidence, an Englishman.

309
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,508
John Winter.

310
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,206
<i>John Winter.</i>

311
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:20,149
Thank you. Yes, by coincidence,
I am an Englishman.

312
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:23,710
But aren't all of us who climb mountains
considered a breed apart?

313
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,653
- Yes.
- It's true.

314
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:30,558
May I pay tribute to one who is already
a legend, yet not so far from our time?

315
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,297
I speak, of course,
of the great guide, Josef Matt.

316
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,630
<i>- Hear, hear!
- There was a mountain man.</i>

317
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:41,138
- There was a man.
- And may his son keep alive his name.

318
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,470
- Thank you.
- Now to bed.

319
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:47,033
But I'm not tired.
I could stay up all night.

320
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,045
Up you go, or I'll put you there.

321
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:52,810
Go on, Rudi.
You need all the sleep you can get.

322
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,875
<i>Good night, Rudi.</i>

323
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,711
Good night, Rudi.

324
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,251
Johann, where are you taking
your party tomorrow?

325
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:06,286
We're going to make a traverse along
the east face, and try to scale that chimney.

326
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:11,700
It's not been climbed before, but
I've always had the idea that if we could...

327
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,251
Good boy.

328
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,620
- No bundle of firewood here!
- So far, so good.

329
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,683
One moment, Franz.

330
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:49,362
This is when I'm sorry for anyone
who's never climbed a mountain.

331
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,996
I am, too.

332
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,235
That this should happen every day
and tens of millions of people never know.

333
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,749
Come on, Captain.
We've still got this face to climb.

334
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:29,397
Look, you can see the hut, sir,
where my father stayed that last night.

335
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,128
Nobody's been there since.

336
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,636
Come on, Rudi.
That's not what we came to see.

337
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:38,403
- That's what I came to see, Franz.
- Aren't you going to the top, Captain?

338
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,671
- No.
- In that case, we might as well eat.

339
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:05,097
Well, there it is. The Fortress.
That's what always stood in my way.

340
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:11,440
Tell me, friends. On Josef Matt's
attempt, did he get above the Fortress?

341
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,773
- No, only to the base.
- Yes, but I'm sure...

342
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:19,010
I heard that he found a route. If he did,
it must have been around the east face.

343
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,778
- Well...
- What do you think, Franz?

344
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:24,845
I don't think about it.
I know nothing of the Citadel.

345
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:29,052
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- No, I would not.

346
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,494
It's an evil mountain. A killer mountain.

347
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,259
It's been left alone now for 16 years.

348
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,497
And it's best to be left alone forever.

349
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,379
Rudi!

350
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,917
What is it?

351
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,434
Rudi! Stay where you are.

352
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,837
No, Captain! I'm coming for him.

353
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,039
I'm taller than you are.
It's easier for me to get back.

354
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,175
He's my nephew and my responsibility.

355
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,382
Wait, Franz.

356
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,662
Franz! It won't hold.

357
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,107
Right, I can hold you now.

358
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,593
I'm sorry, Uncle.

359
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,753
What happened, Rudi?

360
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,259
I thought I'd found a better route.

361
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,867
Hold it there.

362
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,368
Now!

363
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,171
Can you see them?

364
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,211
Well, yes. They're coming down
the mountain, but...

365
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,836
But what?

366
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:29,284
When the porter walks between the client
and the guide, does it mean something?

367
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,401
Yes, Lizbeth. I'm afraid it does.

368
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,139
Don't worry about it, son.
We all make mistakes.

369
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:56,703
What about the other day
when I walked straight into a crevasse?

370
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,951
Good night, Captain.

371
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:36,077
I have business in Geneva, so I thought
I'd take advantage of the bad weather.

372
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,745
But you are coming back?

373
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,812
You know I'm coming back.

374
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:47,488
Franz, you know we could climb
the Citadel together.

375
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,592
And you know I'd rather have you with me
than any man in the world.

376
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,264
Yes, I like to climb with you, too.
But not the Citadel.

377
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,776
Will you make this much
of a bargain with me?

378
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:08,250
Think about it while I'm gone.
When I return, we'll talk once again.

379
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,990
One thing more. About the boy.
Don't be too hard on him.

380
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,191
The boy's all right.
He's back where he belongs.

381
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,575
Get along there. Come on.

382
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:56,956
<i>Good boy, Rudi.
No bundle of firewood here.</i>

383
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,034
<i>May his son
keep alive his name.</i>

384
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,271
But you,
you just couldn't keep it that way!

385
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:11,508
- You had to go and...
- Rudi. It's time you were at the hotel.

386
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,214
Don't forget to put on a clean shirt.

387
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:43,104
- Mother! Where are they?
- Your uncle took them.

388
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:47,781
- But he had no right. They were mine.
- The ax and the knapsack he can use.

389
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,412
The boots he will try and sell
to another guide in the village.

390
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,184
The money, of course, will be yours.

391
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,459
Couldn't he leave me just my boots?

392
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,759
A clean sweep is always best, Rudi.

393
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:05,530
It would be a waste for them to lie in a
cupboard when you have no use for them.

394
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:26,422
- Good morning, Rudi.
- Where did you get them?

395
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,321
From your Uncle Franz.

396
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,486
- Why did he give them to you?
- Because he's a businessman.

397
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,895
And I was in a position to pay him
10 Francs more than Klaus.

398
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,729
Klaus? Wearing my boots!

399
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,996
Excuse me, they are now my boots.

400
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,562
Excuse me. Your boots, Fraulein Hempel.

401
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:54,950
- We saw you come down the mountain.
- Like a bundle of firewood.

402
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,885
- Do you know what happened?
- Not exactly. What did?

403
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:02,051
The worst. The very worst
that could happen to a guide.

404
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,061
I made other people risk their lives.

405
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:12,100
I shamed my uncle. Worst of all,
I lost Captain Winter's faith in me.

406
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,434
Well, you can change that.
After all, he's coming back.

407
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,168
- He is? Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

408
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,208
No, I'll never climb again.

409
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,274
I'd make even a worse guide
than I would a dishwasher.

410
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:32,948
You talk like Klaus Wesselhoft.
Only he brags that he's the best.

411
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,083
You just snivel that you're the worst.

412
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,152
- Rudi!
- Have you something else to say?

413
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,667
Well, it's not very important. But should
you ever want to borrow my boots...

414
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,295
No, thank you.
I won't want to borrow your boots.

415
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,236
...you'll find them in Old Teo's wood box.

416
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,900
A wood box?
Do you want the rats to get them?

417
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:56,344
The wood box is where the cat has her
kittens. And I'll wrap them up carefully.

418
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:01,481
- First, see you oil them. And don't forget.
- I won't forget.

419
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,759
- Your day off tomorrow, isn't it?
- Yes.

420
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,318
Hm. Think I'll have a day off, too.

421
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,887
Gretchen can give them hash.

422
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,799
- Meet me at my house at eight o'clock.
- What do you mean? Where're we going?

423
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:22,396
The Felsberg.
You're going back to school.

424
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:57,262
- The loan of your boots, Fraulein Hempel.
- In exchange for your bundle, Herr Matt.

425
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:00,333
- Be careful, those are my good ones.
- You look how you treat my boots.

426
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,708
Come on, this isn't a picnic.

427
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,913
Ah! Now we'll see once and for all

428
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:13,320
whether you're to be a climber
or a dishwasher.

429
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,987
We will. Which face shall I climb?

430
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,090
That little thing?

431
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,395
It won't be so easy carrying this.

432
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,504
But you can't expect me to...

433
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,168
Let me help you, Teo.

434
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,718
That's going to throw me off balance.

435
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,125
On a real mountain,
which would you sooner be?

436
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:56,359
A little off balance or dead
from cold and starvation?

437
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:01,031
Now, go on, right up to the top.

438
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,504
Come on.

439
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,837
I'll race you to the first ledge.

440
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,575
A three-legged cow
could go faster than you.

441
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,126
That's as far as you go, Lizbeth!
No nonsense now!

442
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,635
Rudi! You're carrying a load, a burden.

443
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:36,469
A real guide carries his pack
as if it were part of his body.

444
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,371
There's a difference, you know.

445
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:22,342
Come on! Don't build a nest up there.

446
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:28,557
I'll have something else for you to do
when you come down.

447
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:34,753
Teo, I've been up and down the mountain
and I did everything you asked.

448
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,890
Why don't you say something?

449
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,366
What do you want me to say?

450
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,198
Did I do well on the climb?

451
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,932
Oh, well enough.
But it didn't really count.

452
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,974
Didn't count? Why not?

453
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,478
Because you climbed alone.
A guide doesn't climb alone.

454
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,274
Everybody knows that.

455
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:54,374
But did you ever stop to think
what the word "guide" means?

456
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,079
It doesn't mean to climb to
a high place and not fall off.

457
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,783
It means to lead others, to help others,
to think of others before yourself.

458
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,519
The other day, that foolishness
on the Wunderhorn, how did it happen?

459
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,619
I told you.
I was looking for a better way down.

460
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:11,326
I think you were looking for a way to
impress Captain Winter and your uncle.

461
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:15,667
Perhaps.
Captain Winter was my only chance.

462
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,366
He's still my only chance.

463
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:22,174
Then you did a thing to be ashamed of.
You were looking for praise and for gain.

464
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:28,445
Two things your father never sought, and
he was the greatest climber of them all.

465
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,385
He could go places
other men could only dream of.

466
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:36,449
He didn't die because a mountain
was too high, nor for conquest or glory.

467
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:40,018
He gave his life because he thought
only of the man in his charge.

468
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,135
Well, there's one thing more.

469
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,567
- Why are you doing that?
- I'm going to climb to the top.

470
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,701
Teo!

471
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:59,579
If a teacher can't trust his own pupil,
why should anyone else?

472
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,379
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm coming, too.

473
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,943
No, you're not.

474
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:11,527
Do you prefer to go barefoot,
or wearing my boots?

475
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,331
All right, come on.

476
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,978
And now for our bundle of firewood!

477
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,594
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

478
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,460
Hold tight.

479
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,313
- Are you all right down there?
- Don't worry about me.

480
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,965
Do you feel like going on?

481
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,030
Course!

482
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,046
Not bad, boy. Not bad at all.

483
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,413
We might make a guide out of him yet.

484
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:19,080
Then you'll have to find yourself
another dishwasher.

485
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,261
When Captain Winter comes back...

486
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,193
Captain Winter, Captain Winter!
Don't you ever think of anyone else?

487
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,258
Yes, you.

488
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,337
What about me?

489
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,396
I don't know.

490
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,272
I guess I never stopped to think.

491
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,435
Come on, come on!

492
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:14,610
You might ask me if I'm going to be
your partner for the festival tomorrow night.

493
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,112
- Well, you are, aren't you?
- Oh, you!

494
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,446
I merely wanted to know your plans since
Klaus Wesselhoft has asked me already.

495
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,487
Klaus Wesselhoft?

496
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:28,285
First my boots, then my girl.
I'll punch him in the nose!

497
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:34,128
Rudi! You should climb a mountain
every day.

498
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:05,383
Scorched. Every last one of them.

499
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:13,226
Well, I certainly hope
you enjoyed yourselves.

500
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:16,737
Which is more than I can hope
for the guests, you lazy little hussy.

501
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:20,468
As I said to Herr Hempel,
I wasn't hired to cook.

502
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:23,670
Oh, and while I remember it,
that Captain Winter was here again.

503
00:56:23,745 --> 00:56:26,680
- Teo, did you hear?
- He'd be deaf if he didn't.

504
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:30,206
- He wanted to tell you goodbye.
- Goodbye?

505
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:34,449
He came over to make some plans
with your uncle, which didn't work out.

506
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:37,117
Anyway, he's left.

507
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:41,219
Left? You mean he's left Kurtal for good?

508
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:43,127
You had better
get something started for dinner.

509
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:47,157
- Go on, go on, go on!
- That's right. For good.

510
00:57:00,282 --> 00:57:05,720
<i>Twice the usual fee,
if I'd climb the Citadel with him!</i>

511
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:09,314
A sum like that
would have been enough to buy a horse.

512
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:13,157
And a foolish man
might have been tempted.

513
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:16,391
But what's the use of a horse
to a dead man?

514
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,692
<i>- You did right, Franz.
- Of course I did right.</i>

515
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:25,866
Any other guide in his right mind
would have done the same.

516
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:28,000
You uncle's in good form tonight.

517
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:30,840
Laying down the law in there.
Can you hear him?

518
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:33,544
Now listen, boy.

519
00:57:33,615 --> 00:57:37,142
You can't let the Englishman, or anyone,
be the end of the world.

520
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:40,916
In climbing, if you can't get the
handholds you want, you take second best.

521
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:43,116
And second best is your uncle.

522
00:57:43,191 --> 00:57:45,785
Why don't you go over there now,
catch him in this mood?

523
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:51,026
Tell him tomorrow you're ready
to go out again as his porter.

524
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:53,124
- Oh, it wouldn't work.
- How do you know?

525
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:56,693
You didn't know you could take us to
the top of the Felsberg until you tried.

526
00:57:56,772 --> 00:57:59,434
- Go on, try.
- Yes, go on.

527
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:02,443
<i>I know every other guide
in the village feels the same as I do.</i>

528
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:06,277
We're not fools. We know
when something's impossible.

529
00:58:06,348 --> 00:58:08,339
Go on.

530
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:12,580
<i>"Captain, you've made me an offer,
and now I'll make you one just as good. "</i>

531
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:17,455
I said, "I'll climb with you for not
twice the usual fee, but for half. "

532
00:58:17,526 --> 00:58:21,724
"Any mountain you like, any peak
from the Weisshorn to the Dom. "

533
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:26,530
He doesn't want that.
All he wants is that cursed mountain.

534
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:30,467
- The man's obsessed. He's crazy.
- He is not crazy.

535
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:33,599
I would pay Captain Winter if he would
take me when he climbs the Citadel.

536
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:36,872
You? You would have to pay.

537
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:41,075
But where in Switzerland
is there all that money?

538
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:45,609
Get back to your dishes
before I lose my temper.

539
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:48,247
What are you doing here, anyway?

540
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:54,054
I've come to tell you that no matter what,
I've decided to be a guide.

541
00:58:54,129 --> 00:58:57,360
- What did you say?
- Captain Winter came to see me.

542
00:58:57,432 --> 00:58:59,161
If he still believes in me, why can't you?

543
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:02,294
Captain Winter is famous
for believing in the impossible,

544
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,998
but I doubt if even he would go that far.

545
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:08,008
Be careful, boy. I warned you.

546
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:11,807
Please, Uncle. Won't you try me?
Let me be your porter tomorrow.

547
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,780
- No.
- Why not?

548
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:18,183
Because I have two hands,
two legs, one head.

549
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:21,518
I need those for my clients
and to look after myself.

550
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:25,822
Now, get back where you belong.

551
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:31,128
We leave early, do we not, Herr Lerner?
I think I'll go too, and get to sleep.

552
00:59:32,033 --> 00:59:35,264
You heard? So did all the village.

553
00:59:35,337 --> 00:59:40,365
Now everyone knows that I'm no good.
My own uncle wouldn't have me.

554
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:43,468
Let him go, Teo.
There's nothing we could say.

555
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:47,606
Well, afraid you lost that partner
for the festival tomorrow, but I...

556
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:49,547
Good night, Teo.

557
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,226
The shadows dance and play

558
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:09,227
Gone are the cares of the day

559
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:11,704
Night is here

560
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:15,641
A bird on the hill

561
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,647
Sings a haunting lullaby

562
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:24,811
- The bright stars are jewels...
- Psst! Psst!

563
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:28,378
In the dark's velvet cloak...

564
01:00:29,624 --> 01:00:33,185
I must now get ready
to announce the dancing.

565
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:38,722
And the gentle breezes sigh

566
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,203
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

567
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:48,439
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

568
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:53,072
Ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

569
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:58,245
Good night, Valais

570
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,984
Good night

571
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:06,425
<i>And now, everybody,
I want you all to enjoy yourselves.</i>

572
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:08,485
We start the waltz.

573
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:14,325
Rudi!

574
01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:18,735
Where have you been?
The dancing's started already.

575
01:01:18,807 --> 01:01:22,971
- I'm not coming. Not after last night.
- Rudi, forget about last night.

576
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:27,510
Look at me.

577
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:32,047
It's the first year I was able to wear
my grandmother's dress.

578
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,283
Her wedding dress.

579
01:01:35,357 --> 01:01:37,518
You look nice.

580
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:40,227
I guess... even pretty.

581
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:42,286
Do I?

582
01:01:43,732 --> 01:01:44,790
Really?

583
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:50,999
Then you must come. If for no other
reason than somebody said you wouldn't.

584
01:01:51,072 --> 01:01:53,267
Who said?

585
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:58,108
Well, what difference,
so long as it isn't true?

586
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:01,114
Well, it is true.
How could I go out there?

587
01:02:01,182 --> 01:02:06,518
Will you stop feeling sorry for yourself?
It's as though you enjoy being unhappy.

588
01:02:06,588 --> 01:02:09,716
Well, I don't. I want to dance.

589
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:15,786
Thank you, Klaus.

590
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:20,634
Why would you want to dance with me
if you could have Klaus Wesselhoft?

591
01:02:20,702 --> 01:02:24,001
He says he's the best dancer in Kurtal.

592
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:26,632
You've grown up
to your grandmother's wedding dress.

593
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:30,701
Don't you think you should stop
wasting your time on a kitchen boy?

594
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:33,373
Yes, I think I should.

595
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:48,485
Rudi. Rudi.

596
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:26,197
<i>And now the polka!</i>

597
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:42,406
<i>You expect us to believe that?</i>

598
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:45,942
<i>It's true, I'm telling you.
Someone's on the Citadel tonight.</i>

599
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,352
Nobody's been up there for years.

600
01:03:48,523 --> 01:03:51,424
We saw it from the Blue Glacier
when we were lighting the beacon fires.

601
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:53,484
Ah, you're dreaming.

602
01:03:53,595 --> 01:03:56,792
Peter, tell them
what you saw this afternoon.

603
01:03:56,865 --> 01:03:59,527
Smoke, coming from the old hut
on the southeast ridge.

604
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:03,867
- Who'd be up there?
- You don't get smoke from an empty hut.

605
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:07,169
I tell you, there must be someone up there.

606
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:10,507
It's no one from Kurtal, I'm sure of that.

607
01:04:43,278 --> 01:04:45,872
There's someone outside, Emil.

608
01:04:46,848 --> 01:04:49,715
- There couldn't be.
- But there is.

609
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:53,680
Rudi!

610
01:04:54,722 --> 01:04:58,214
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I've come to join you, sir.

611
01:04:58,293 --> 01:05:00,591
Join me?

612
01:05:00,662 --> 01:05:03,153
Yes, to climb the Citadel.

613
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,337
I know what you're thinking,
but I've learned since last time.

614
01:05:11,272 --> 01:05:15,299
Oh, Emil Saxo of Broli,
meet Rudi Matt of Kurtal.

615
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:19,676
- Kurtal?
- Son of the great Josef Matt.

616
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:24,875
So?

617
01:05:24,986 --> 01:05:29,082
Come and have some breakfast, Rudi.
We'll talk this over.

618
01:05:37,165 --> 01:05:41,101
Sit down, Rudi.
When did you leave Kurtal?

619
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:43,194
Late last night, sir.

620
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,739
And what did your mother and Franz say
about you coming?

621
01:05:45,807 --> 01:05:48,173
Oh, they said it was all right.

622
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:50,473
- You mean they gave their permission?
- Mmm.

623
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:55,273
Why would Franz let you come
if he wouldn't come himself?

624
01:05:57,018 --> 01:06:00,419
The sun is up. We'd better get going.

625
01:06:00,488 --> 01:06:03,548
- You're starting today?
- No, today we're just looking around.

626
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:07,288
Perhaps we'll follow the ridge
as far as the Fortress. If we can make it.

627
01:06:07,362 --> 01:06:09,330
I think we can make it. I think we...

628
01:06:09,397 --> 01:06:12,696
We? You mean this boy is coming?

629
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:15,998
Well, why not? He can climb, and well.

630
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:21,372
Still no reason to drag a boy
up 6,000 feet to the top of the Citadel,

631
01:06:21,442 --> 01:06:24,104
no matter whose son he is.

632
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:29,244
It's not the Citadel
we're climbing today, Emil.

633
01:06:29,317 --> 01:06:32,013
You are the master.

634
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:38,423
Now, listen to me, Rudi.
One thing must be understood.

635
01:06:38,493 --> 01:06:40,393
There'll be no experimenting,

636
01:06:40,461 --> 01:06:43,123
no individual climbing
and no route finding of your own.

637
01:06:43,197 --> 01:06:45,256
You'll be an apprentice porter,
and that's all.

638
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,801
That's enough.
I told you, I've learned my lesson.

639
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:50,337
All right, let's make a start.

640
01:06:50,605 --> 01:06:53,267
All I could find out was
there's only two of them.

641
01:06:53,341 --> 01:06:54,899
- Did they have equipment, porters?
- Nothing.

642
01:06:54,976 --> 01:06:57,911
No one's been near that mountain for 15...

643
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:03,682
- What's the matter?
- Haven't you heard the news?

644
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:08,085
- What news?
- The Englishman is climbing the Citadel.

645
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:12,519
It's not possible.

646
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:15,528
Maybe it's not possible, but he's trying.

647
01:07:16,631 --> 01:07:21,796
He may be crazy, but he's not so crazy
as to try and climb the Citadel alone.

648
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:25,168
- Who said he was alone?
- You mean he has a guide?

649
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:28,970
- What guide went with him?
- He's with Emil Saxo.

650
01:07:31,379 --> 01:07:34,348
- Who told you that?
- Today I went to Broli on business.

651
01:07:34,415 --> 01:07:37,282
But no one cared about business.

652
01:07:37,352 --> 01:07:40,617
All they would talk about
was this Captain Winter and Emil Saxo.

653
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:43,680
How they left yesterday for the Citadel.

654
01:07:43,758 --> 01:07:47,694
All afternoon we've been watching through
the telescope, but we couldn't see them.

655
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:51,493
And we won't, because the mountain
will strike, throw them down.

656
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:56,731
Saxo... Emil Saxo. I might have known it.

657
01:07:57,405 --> 01:07:59,999
Can you see them?

658
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:02,338
Yes, I think so.

659
01:08:03,244 --> 01:08:06,145
And, unless there are
spots before my eyes...

660
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:10,674
You look, Lizbeth.
I don't want to make a fool of myself.

661
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:15,385
No, Teo, there are
no spots before your eyes,

662
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:18,584
any more than there were a pair of boots
in the wood box this morning.

663
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:21,389
- There are three of them.
- Yes!

664
01:08:21,462 --> 01:08:25,865
They are waiting for me, over in the tavern.
I mustn't keep them in suspense.

665
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:28,299
Then go, but don't blurt it out.

666
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,661
Make them suffer.

667
01:08:43,584 --> 01:08:46,883
- Have you seen them, Teo?
- I have.

668
01:08:49,991 --> 01:08:54,325
Oh, yes. Yes. They're up there all right.

669
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:59,694
- I think he means it.
- Let's have a look.

670
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:01,932
It's no good looking now.

671
01:09:02,003 --> 01:09:05,700
I watched all the time they were in sight
until they moved in behind the ridge.

672
01:09:05,773 --> 01:09:09,470
Are you sure of this?
You swear that you saw them?

673
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:12,602
Marie, a beer.

674
01:09:15,249 --> 01:09:17,581
Yes, of course I can swear.

675
01:09:18,519 --> 01:09:22,512
For almost five minutes I watched
as they moved up in a row.

676
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:27,323
One... two... three.

677
01:09:27,395 --> 01:09:29,420
Three? Did you say three?

678
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:31,397
That's right.

679
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:33,093
Thank you, Marie.

680
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:37,297
- Three. How could there be three?
- You didn't hear that in Broli?

681
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:40,033
No, they said nothing about a third one.

682
01:09:40,107 --> 01:09:45,101
Let's drink to him.
To the third man on the mountain.

683
01:09:46,647 --> 01:09:50,743
To Rudi Matt!
The only true mountaineer in Kurtal.

684
01:09:50,818 --> 01:09:52,945
Angel face? A mountaineer?

685
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,184
What are you talking about?
Rudi would be the last...

686
01:09:57,258 --> 01:10:02,662
It is Rudi. It's my fool of a nephew
who's on the Citadel.

687
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,665
His bed was empty
when his mother went to wake him.

688
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:10,227
An ax and a pack the Englishman gave
him vanished from my house in the night.

689
01:10:10,304 --> 01:10:13,205
And he hasn't been at work all day.

690
01:10:13,274 --> 01:10:15,765
We thought he was sulking,
roaming the hills.

691
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:19,301
- Instead of saving your foolish faces.
- Watch what you say, old man.

692
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:23,612
I will. And what I say is this.

693
01:10:23,684 --> 01:10:29,247
You call yourselves guides.
I call you a herd of sheep.

694
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:32,622
Every day you go out and climb peaks
that have been climbed 100 times before.

695
01:10:32,693 --> 01:10:34,854
Peaks your grandmothers could climb.

696
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:37,363
Then you come back
and tell yourselves how good you are.

697
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:40,594
Well, maybe now you'll find out
you're not so good.

698
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:44,665
Three climbers are on the Citadel tonight.

699
01:10:44,739 --> 01:10:47,606
An Englishman, a man from Broli,

700
01:10:47,675 --> 01:10:51,167
and from Kurtal, who? A man?

701
01:10:51,245 --> 01:10:53,543
No. A boy.

702
01:10:53,614 --> 01:10:57,482
An 18-year-old boy,
who alone among you is not afraid.

703
01:10:57,552 --> 01:11:01,044
- Who's afraid?
- You are, bigmouth. You all are.

704
01:11:01,122 --> 01:11:03,886
Since Josef Matt died 16 years ago,

705
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,483
not one of you has dared
set foot on the Citadel.

706
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:11,897
All right, sit in the tavern.
Swill your beer.

707
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:17,302
Do you care if the world no longer knows
the Citadel as the mountain of Kurtal,

708
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:21,065
but as the mountain of Broli?

709
01:11:24,111 --> 01:11:27,808
You heard what he said,
and he's lucky he's standing on his feet.

710
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,542
<i>I'm not a coward,
nor is any guide of Kurtal.</i>

711
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:34,713
We are not fools
who want to throw away our lives.

712
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:37,280
Too many men have died on the Citadel.

713
01:11:37,358 --> 01:11:40,759
It has not been climbed.
Nor will it ever be.

714
01:11:40,828 --> 01:11:45,527
This I will do. Tomorrow morning,
I will go to the Citadel.

715
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,068
I will go on
until I find the three who are up there.

716
01:11:48,135 --> 01:11:49,762
And when I find them,

717
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:53,238
I shall talk Captain Winter out of his
foolishness and bring down my nephew.

718
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:54,774
I'll go with you.

719
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:57,106
- And me.
- Count me in.

720
01:11:57,178 --> 01:12:01,706
- Also my brother.
- With myself, that makes five.

721
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,616
- Six.
- You?

722
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:10,851
I won't hold you up.
This is something I don't intend to miss.

723
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,784
All right.

724
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:16,762
Oh, Teo, you were wonderful.

725
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:25,669
You were beautiful. I wish somebody
had written it down for my grandchildren.

726
01:13:13,187 --> 01:13:15,178
Look out!

727
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:36,733
Captain Winter!

728
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,910
Captain Winter?

729
01:13:43,517 --> 01:13:46,111
It's nothing. It just grazed me.

730
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:52,382
Out of the way, boy.

731
01:13:54,595 --> 01:13:58,759
It was stupid, letting you try
such a slope in this weather.

732
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:01,764
Do you think it was the mountain
warning us?

733
01:14:01,836 --> 01:14:04,168
No, sir. I agree with Herr Saxo.

734
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:06,968
We didn't even reach
the base of the Fortress.

735
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:10,875
Don't worry about that. I've been
thinking of a way past the Fortress.

736
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:15,345
It's either straight up, or round
the other side towards the east face.

737
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:19,853
No. My father and Sir Edward
tried both of those ways.

738
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,254
- Teo says there was no route.
- Perhaps they didn't try hard enough.

739
01:14:24,325 --> 01:14:28,853
There's no use arguing.
Let's try and get back to the hut.

740
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:52,648
- You were starting without me.
- Not for the Citadel, Rudi.

741
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,156
We're going down to Broli for tents and
supplies. We'll be back in the morning.

742
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:58,191
Next day, if the weather's good...

743
01:14:58,259 --> 01:15:00,819
Am I going to Broli with you,
or am I going to stay here?

744
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:05,559
- Neither. You're going back to Kurtal.
- What did I do this time?

745
01:15:06,267 --> 01:15:11,227
Nothing. Even Emil had no complaints.
I want you to take a message to your uncle.

746
01:15:11,305 --> 01:15:15,002
Tell him it's not too late.
Tell him I want him with us.

747
01:15:15,075 --> 01:15:17,066
What was that?

748
01:15:17,144 --> 01:15:20,978
- Who you want with us?
- The boy's uncle, Franz Lerner.

749
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:25,050
- Not with me.
- What do you mean?

750
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:29,681
A guide from Broli
does not climb with a guide from Kurtal.

751
01:15:29,757 --> 01:15:31,315
That's petty and ridiculous.

752
01:15:31,392 --> 01:15:34,190
Franz Lerner is one of the great guides
of Switzerland.

753
01:15:34,261 --> 01:15:37,162
I've climbed with him on the Weisshorn,
the Dom, the Donnelberg.

754
01:15:37,231 --> 01:15:39,131
But not the Citadel.

755
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,101
When you asked him to climb the Citadel,
he shook in his boots, didn't he?

756
01:15:42,169 --> 01:15:45,366
So you had to come to Broli
to find yourself a guide.

757
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:47,600
A guide who did not shake in his boots.

758
01:15:47,675 --> 01:15:52,009
I know all about that, Emil. You weren't
afraid and I appreciate the fact...

759
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:55,776
Then, please, let me climb
the Citadel with you alone.

760
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,681
For the honor of my village.

761
01:15:57,751 --> 01:16:01,744
Alone with you,
not with some coward of a Kurtaler.

762
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:07,722
But why worry? He won't come, anyway.

763
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:14,092
All right, Rudi.
Get your breakfast and be on your way.

764
01:16:14,168 --> 01:16:16,159
Please don't send me back, sir.

765
01:16:16,237 --> 01:16:20,003
Herr Saxo was right. My uncle
wouldn't come, and when he sees me...

766
01:16:20,074 --> 01:16:23,305
Don't argue, Rudi. Just tell your uncle
if he lets you come, he can come himself.

767
01:16:24,545 --> 01:16:27,309
We'll meet here around noon tomorrow.

768
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:29,372
Yes, sir.

769
01:18:30,804 --> 01:18:33,705
My father's route!

770
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:47,647
- I wonder if we'll find them here yet.
- We'll find no boy and no uncle.

771
01:19:52,052 --> 01:19:54,680
It seems you were wrong, Emil.

772
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:01,693
Two men didn't carry all this.

773
01:20:08,502 --> 01:20:10,834
- Franz, I'm so pleased...
- Where's the boy?

774
01:20:10,904 --> 01:20:14,362
- Isn't he with you?
- How could he be with us?

775
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:19,275
Why do you pretend
when we know he's here?

776
01:20:19,346 --> 01:20:22,179
Of course he was here.
He left yesterday for Kurtal.

777
01:20:22,249 --> 01:20:25,810
Why would he go to Kurtal when
three nights ago he ran away to join you?

778
01:20:25,886 --> 01:20:28,446
Surely he had your permission?

779
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:31,184
- Is that what he told you?
- Yes.

780
01:20:31,258 --> 01:20:33,749
He had nobody's permission.

781
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:38,923
- Have you searched for him?
- Yes, since we got here yesterday.

782
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:41,229
Up and down the rock face
as far as the ice fall.

783
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:45,601
Franz, we'd better start all over again.
Search every crevasse.

784
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:51,305
- You're the one to answer for this.
- I? What have I to do with it?

785
01:20:51,378 --> 01:20:56,247
Everything. Only a guide from Broli
would stand by and let a boy be lost.

786
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:04,923
- That's enough. Franz! Saxo!
- Mother of God!

787
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,251
I've found it.

788
01:21:14,668 --> 01:21:17,603
- I've found it.
- Found what, Rudi?

789
01:21:19,139 --> 01:21:21,869
The way past the Fortress.

790
01:21:23,243 --> 01:21:25,108
My father's route to the top.

791
01:21:25,179 --> 01:21:27,943
All alone, you got as far as the Fortress?

792
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:31,542
I've been up there all night.

793
01:21:31,618 --> 01:21:35,281
Teo, it's a chimney. It leads to the top.

794
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:41,624
- You climbed it?
- No. There was a storm.

795
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:47,633
So, we weren't crazy after all, were we?

796
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:50,431
No. We knew.

797
01:22:05,452 --> 01:22:08,910
- Uncle, are you angry?
- What would be the use?

798
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:13,152
- And my mother?
- So you remembered you had a mother?

799
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:16,560
- Every minute I remembered.
- That I doubt.

800
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:19,724
But if you don't think of her, I do.

801
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,292
I told her that if you were still alive,
I'd find you.

802
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:27,773
All right, I found you.
Now I'll take you home.

803
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:31,333
Come along, it'll be dark
before we reach the trail.

804
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:34,312
The boy isn't going.

805
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:37,043
You stay out of this, Teo.
It's none of your business.

806
01:22:37,117 --> 01:22:39,312
It is my business.

807
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:43,117
I climbed with Josef Matt on the Citadel
and with his son on the Felsberg.

808
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:45,750
I know what he can do.

809
01:22:45,826 --> 01:22:51,025
Give the boy a chance and he might be
even a greater guide than his father was.

810
01:22:51,098 --> 01:22:55,899
He's right, Franz.
The boy deserves his chance.

811
01:22:55,969 --> 01:23:00,531
And from me of all people he deserves it.
You know why.

812
01:23:00,607 --> 01:23:03,041
Franz, why did you come up here today?

813
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:08,070
You know why I came.
I came to take back my nephew.

814
01:23:08,148 --> 01:23:12,016
No, you didn't.
You came because Saxo and I were here.

815
01:23:12,085 --> 01:23:14,246
And you knew
we were going to climb the Citadel.

816
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:18,883
It is true. It was also because of Saxo.
He has no right here.

817
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:22,156
Not even to step inside this hut.

818
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:26,131
This hut belongs to us.
And so does the Citadel.

819
01:23:26,199 --> 01:23:30,067
The whole world knows it
as the mountain of Kurtal.

820
01:23:30,137 --> 01:23:33,402
- That will soon be changed.
- By whom is it to be changed?

821
01:23:35,275 --> 01:23:38,335
You listen to me.

822
01:23:38,412 --> 01:23:42,007
I have listened to you talking and talking.
Now you listen to me.

823
01:23:42,082 --> 01:23:47,076
For ten years I have circled the Citadel
and explored the routes to it.

824
01:23:47,154 --> 01:23:49,987
Did I ever see you, or any other Kurtaler?

825
01:23:50,057 --> 01:23:54,153
How many years has it been
since you slept in your hut?

826
01:23:54,227 --> 01:23:56,718
Stood on your mountain?

827
01:23:56,797 --> 01:24:00,426
And why did you stir up your stomachs
to come today?

828
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:04,994
I'll tell you why. Because you are
jealous, because you are cowards.

829
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:10,203
Because you do not want to see
Emil Saxo of Broli

830
01:24:10,277 --> 01:24:14,111
do what you are afraid to do yourselves.

831
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:19,518
Wait! You think I am a coward?
You think I am afraid of a mountain?

832
01:24:19,586 --> 01:24:23,420
- Well, aren't you?
- No, I am not.

833
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:26,288
I've come here to climb the Citadel.

834
01:24:28,228 --> 01:24:31,994
I knew you'd join us, Franz.
I never doubted it.

835
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:36,966
- In that case, you go without me.
- No, Emil.

836
01:24:38,905 --> 01:24:43,239
I need you, too. We need the strongest
team that ever climbed the Alps.

837
01:24:51,918 --> 01:24:54,614
The weather is clearing.

838
01:24:56,256 --> 01:24:59,419
We leave in the morning. The four of us.

839
01:25:01,128 --> 01:25:03,119
That's right, isn't it? Four to go.

840
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,215
Now, listen. This is how it'll be.

841
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:25,308
Somebody must go down to Kurtal.
I think you, Teo.

842
01:25:25,385 --> 01:25:27,945
- Do you? Then you think again.
- You have a job.

843
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:32,014
I'm also 65 years. I don't intend
to miss this. Besides, you'll need a cook.

844
01:25:32,092 --> 01:25:36,153
How about Paul? He's got to go back
anyhow. His wife's expecting a child.

845
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:40,188
But I've six children already.
Believe me, it's nothing.

846
01:25:40,267 --> 01:25:44,761
All right, Paul, you go.
My sister, before anybody, go to her.

847
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:49,400
Tell her only that we've found the boy,
he's here at the hut and all right.

848
01:25:49,476 --> 01:25:54,379
Don't, on any account, tell her
that he'll be on the mountain.

849
01:25:55,182 --> 01:25:59,175
For you, Captain,
I'm doing strange things.

850
01:25:59,252 --> 01:26:02,312
God grant I shan't live to regret them.

851
01:26:25,045 --> 01:26:27,206
No, wait, Emil.

852
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:31,011
Let Rudi take the lead.
He's the one who knows the way.

853
01:26:39,059 --> 01:26:41,550
Shall I go?

854
01:27:48,161 --> 01:27:51,062
- Is that the place, Rudi?
- Yes, sir.

855
01:27:52,332 --> 01:27:55,893
How do you know it goes all the way, boy?
You didn't climb it.

856
01:27:55,969 --> 01:28:01,430
- I told you. There was a storm.
- Then what do you really know about it?

857
01:28:01,508 --> 01:28:05,774
What do any of us know
until we've examined it?

858
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:09,781
- I'll take a look at it.
- If you don't mind, I'm still first guide.

859
01:28:12,552 --> 01:28:14,543
Or am I?

860
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:18,224
Yes, Emil, you're still first guide.

861
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:44,376
I could have told you. It tapers off.

862
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:50,356
It goes nowhere, and even if it did go
anywhere, it's too small for a man to climb.

863
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:52,584
- Are you sure?
- You come and try it.

864
01:28:57,197 --> 01:29:01,361
All right, Emil, we'll go back
and try your way.

865
01:29:09,509 --> 01:29:11,500
Oh, it's nothing.

866
01:29:12,946 --> 01:29:14,937
Let us go.

867
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,445
May I try? I still know it's the way.

868
01:29:18,518 --> 01:29:22,113
Remember that first day?
Not what happened, what we talked about.

869
01:29:22,188 --> 01:29:25,021
That day you believed.

870
01:29:25,091 --> 01:29:27,616
There's some things you just know.

871
01:29:31,865 --> 01:29:35,096
All right, Rudi. I'll give you a hand.

872
01:30:29,322 --> 01:30:32,519
Rudi? Are you all right?

873
01:30:32,826 --> 01:30:35,317
I'll tell you what it is. He's stuck.

874
01:30:40,734 --> 01:30:44,500
He could be stuck there
till the end of his days.

875
01:30:49,309 --> 01:30:51,971
I've done it again.

876
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:55,480
Rudi, if you can hear me, answer.

877
01:31:51,971 --> 01:31:54,462
I've done it!

878
01:31:59,179 --> 01:32:04,082
- Hello.
- Well done, Rudi. Send down a rope.

879
01:32:25,471 --> 01:32:28,372
Well, there it is.

880
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:33,306
<i>And also, the way between,
we don't know what we'll find.</i>

881
01:32:33,379 --> 01:32:37,338
Difficulties, yes, but no major obstacles.

882
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:39,408
Two hours will do it.

883
01:32:41,955 --> 01:32:44,014
Is your head hurting again, sir?

884
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:47,856
- No, it's nothing. Let's go on.
- No, Captain. This is no good.

885
01:32:47,927 --> 01:32:50,725
At the end of the snow,
we'll stop for the night.

886
01:32:50,797 --> 01:32:53,960
In the morning, when you're rested,
we'll go on to the top.

887
01:32:54,033 --> 01:32:56,831
But the weather might change.
We may lose our chance.

888
01:32:56,903 --> 01:33:00,100
He's right, Franz.
The weather could change.

889
01:33:01,107 --> 01:33:02,836
A risk we will take.

890
01:33:20,927 --> 01:33:22,519
<i>- Franz Lerner.
- Mm?</i>

891
01:33:22,595 --> 01:33:24,586
Franz Lerner!

892
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:27,796
What is it?

893
01:33:27,867 --> 01:33:31,098
Come out here a minute.
I want to talk to you.

894
01:33:36,576 --> 01:33:38,567
What's the matter?

895
01:33:39,512 --> 01:33:42,675
- Is he worse?
- He is not worse, but he is not better.

896
01:33:42,749 --> 01:33:47,277
He won't be able to go tomorrow.
It's the end of it for him.

897
01:33:48,955 --> 01:33:51,924
- But it needn't be for us.
- What do you mean?

898
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:54,425
Tomorrow the weather will be good.
After that, who knows?

899
01:33:54,494 --> 01:33:57,861
If we leave at first dawn,
we could be there by eight.

900
01:33:57,931 --> 01:34:01,196
The boy will stay with him.
He won't be left alone.

901
01:34:01,267 --> 01:34:07,331
- And it's what he would want us to do.
- It's not a question of what he would want.

902
01:34:07,407 --> 01:34:10,706
A guide, at any rate a guide of Kurtal,

903
01:34:10,777 --> 01:34:14,474
does not leave his client on a mountain
and go on alone.

904
01:34:25,591 --> 01:34:28,754
- Do you think he will go on alone?
- Even of Saxo I wouldn't believe it.

905
01:34:28,828 --> 01:34:31,456
Go to sleep, boy.

906
01:34:59,826 --> 01:35:01,885
Let me have a look.

907
01:35:04,864 --> 01:35:06,991
- I see someone.
- Where?

908
01:35:07,066 --> 01:35:09,864
- High above the Fortress.
- Only one?

909
01:35:09,936 --> 01:35:14,839
- Wait. Now I see two people.
- No others?

910
01:35:15,842 --> 01:35:20,176
- No. Just two black specks.
- Didn't you say there were four?

911
01:35:20,246 --> 01:35:24,706
There were four yesterday.
They may have changed places higher up.

912
01:35:24,784 --> 01:35:28,777
Captain Winter with Saxo, probably.
Franz with Rudi.

913
01:35:30,823 --> 01:35:34,725
- I mean that...
- You mean my son is on the Citadel.

914
01:35:36,562 --> 01:35:39,326
You've lied to me.

915
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:41,890
You've all lied to me.

916
01:35:43,002 --> 01:35:45,436
Frau Matt!

917
01:35:45,505 --> 01:35:48,497
Well, Lizbeth, I hope you're satisfied.

918
01:35:48,574 --> 01:35:52,670
Yes. Rudi's doing
what he was meant to do.

919
01:35:52,745 --> 01:35:56,408
What right have you to say what he was
meant to do? How could you know?

920
01:35:56,482 --> 01:36:02,250
You've never been a wife, a mother.
You've never lost a man.

921
01:36:02,321 --> 01:36:05,313
But don't you see,
we both nearly lost a man?

922
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:08,724
- Why couldn't you have left him alone?
- But it was Rudi himself.

923
01:36:08,795 --> 01:36:10,695
It wasn't me.

924
01:36:10,763 --> 01:36:13,163
Nor was it Old Teo.

925
01:36:13,232 --> 01:36:16,929
That's what makes it so right.
So wonderful.

926
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:19,563
Would you want to be the wife of a guide?

927
01:36:19,639 --> 01:36:23,302
Yes. Or a dishwasher.

928
01:36:23,376 --> 01:36:26,174
Or a hotel proprietor.

929
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:31,346
But never the wife of a hotel proprietor
who wanted to climb mountains.

930
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:35,581
Because a man must do what he feels
he must do, or he isn't a man.

931
01:36:36,355 --> 01:36:40,121
And no one, wife, mother or sweetheart,

932
01:36:40,193 --> 01:36:44,289
has the right to make him
into something he wasn't meant to be.

933
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:49,167
I'm sorry you didn't know.
I'm sorry they lied to you.

934
01:36:51,237 --> 01:36:56,231
There's nothing to do now, is there?
He'll never be anything but a guide.

935
01:36:57,176 --> 01:36:58,473
No, Frau Matt.

936
01:37:03,015 --> 01:37:05,506
Where are the others, Franz?
What happened?

937
01:37:05,585 --> 01:37:07,280
Gone, the two of them.

938
01:37:07,353 --> 01:37:10,652
It's what Saxo threatened last night
when he said you were too sick to try,

939
01:37:10,723 --> 01:37:13,157
and that crazy boy's gone after him.

940
01:37:13,226 --> 01:37:16,059
- All right, I'm ready.
- Ready for what?

941
01:37:16,129 --> 01:37:18,393
- To go after them.
- No. Captain, you're too weak.

942
01:37:18,464 --> 01:37:20,762
I'm much better. The pain's gone.

943
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:24,064
Then, if you don't mind staying here
for a few hours, I'll go up and...

944
01:37:24,137 --> 01:37:26,799
I mind very much. We're going together.

945
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:30,168
Don't worry,
I won't be a bundle of firewood.

946
01:38:36,309 --> 01:38:39,005
Herr Saxo! Don't move!

947
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:47,010
Herr Saxo, you're hurt.

948
01:38:48,821 --> 01:38:50,550
Badly hurt.

949
01:38:50,623 --> 01:38:52,614
I'll make you a sling.

950
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:56,952
Let me alone!
I don't need help from you.

951
01:39:00,099 --> 01:39:02,659
Go on back. You've won.

952
01:39:03,769 --> 01:39:07,227
Climb to the top and crow like a cock.

953
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,742
Herr Saxo, there must be some way
I can hold you.

954
01:39:15,147 --> 01:39:20,813
Go on, boy. Go on, kitchen boy.
You've won, I'm telling you.

955
01:39:20,886 --> 01:39:24,151
And I've lost. Claim your victory.

956
01:39:24,223 --> 01:39:28,853
Leave me.
You've left the others, why not me?

957
01:39:29,762 --> 01:39:32,822
I'm nothing to you.
Not even a friend. Go on.

958
01:39:36,902 --> 01:39:39,393
That's it. You are no fool.

959
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,841
Take it. You'll be a hero.

960
01:39:45,711 --> 01:39:47,201
Conqueror of the Citadel.

961
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:50,749
Your father's son.

962
01:39:58,357 --> 01:40:02,453
I'm making you a sling.
Since we can't go up, we'll go down.

963
01:40:13,873 --> 01:40:16,068
It's Rudi's pack.

964
01:40:16,142 --> 01:40:18,133
Rudi!

965
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:22,804
Rudi!

966
01:40:24,884 --> 01:40:30,220
- He must have fallen.
- His pack would still be on his back.

967
01:40:30,289 --> 01:40:32,621
We'd better push on.

968
01:40:35,194 --> 01:40:37,628
We can pick those things up
on the way down.

969
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:41,189
He brought these
all the way up from Kurtal.

970
01:40:41,267 --> 01:40:44,327
I think he'd like them at the top.

971
01:41:26,145 --> 01:41:28,136
Herr Saxo.

972
01:41:30,816 --> 01:41:34,183
- I'm done. Finished.
- You can't stop now.

973
01:41:36,122 --> 01:41:38,113
The tents are just below.

974
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:44,093
No, boy. You leave me here.

975
01:41:46,065 --> 01:41:49,398
- You'll never get me down.
- I will get you down.

976
01:41:49,468 --> 01:41:51,902
Now, just try! Try!

977
01:43:35,374 --> 01:43:37,865
Thanks, boy.

978
01:44:20,586 --> 01:44:24,920
- Come, Lizbeth.
- No, it should only be you.

979
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:26,855
My turn will come.

980
01:44:30,162 --> 01:44:32,995
I'm sorry if I made you worry again.

981
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,094
You're not angry? You're happy!

982
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:41,503
Yes, Rudi, and very proud.

983
01:44:53,919 --> 01:45:00,017
You, the conquerors of the Citadel,
which stands above our valley,

984
01:45:00,092 --> 01:45:03,323
there it will stand forever,

985
01:45:03,395 --> 01:45:10,198
and all men will know it by your names,
as your mountain.

986
01:45:16,575 --> 01:45:20,306
Forgive me, Herr Hempel,
but you're wrong. It's not our mountain.

987
01:45:20,379 --> 01:45:22,711
It's Rudi's mountain.

988
01:45:23,482 --> 01:45:26,918
Rudi? Rudi, come up here.

989
01:45:31,557 --> 01:45:34,526
- I didn't even get to the top, sir.
- Look.

990
01:45:43,569 --> 01:45:48,632
- You carried it up. You put it there.
- No, Rudi. You put it there.

991
01:45:48,707 --> 01:45:50,937
You and your father.

992
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:53,001
That is true.

993
01:45:53,078 --> 01:45:57,674
- He could have been the first.
- And so could his father.

994
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:00,810
Long live our dishwasher! Bravo!

995
01:46:06,759 --> 01:46:10,957
Say something, Rudi. Don't just stand
there like a lump. Invite them up to see.

996
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:12,964
- Where's Lizbeth?
- There she is.

997
01:46:13,032 --> 01:46:15,364
Here I am, Rudi.
