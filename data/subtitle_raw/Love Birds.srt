1
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,629
My name is Giri...

2
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,087
I am waiting in

3
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:25,087
my lawyer friend Maya's office.

4
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:26,879
Oh! God!

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:27,546
She is

6
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,171
Maya...

7
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,379
Last night I took the tablet late,

8
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:33,004
it's gotten late now!

9
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:34,878
The reason she woke up late
I have so much work to do!

10
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,796
is not laziness...

11
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,171
Whatever may be the case

12
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,837
she is confident of an easy win!

13
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:40,879
In every case...

14
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:42,962
She will use some trick and win!

15
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:44,837
I will tell you about a tough case...

16
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:47,046
The son of a powerful MLA's divorce case...

17
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,462
Arguing for the opposition was

18
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:51,754
the one who defeated defeat itself...

19
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,254
Senior lawyer Sachidanand!

20
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:54,796
The proof is here...

21
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:57,087
Whatever the argument
or counter argument there be...

22
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:59,046
When it comes to the judgement of the court...

23
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,546
Do you have any proof with you?

24
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,671
Is the proof that is weighed!

25
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:03,379
Look here ma'am,

26
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:04,587
they have so much proof!

27
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:05,879
Even I have checked...

28
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:07,087
Everything is correct!

29
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:08,546
After lunch

30
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,421
I will pass the judgement.

31
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,129
But even without proof she won the case!

32
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:14,129
Your Honour, I want to tell you a story...

33
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,254
To win a case prove a case,
you need proof

34
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:21,421
but to prove the love between
a husband and a wife

35
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:22,712
emotions are enough!

36
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:24,671
In one story

37
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,504
she emotionally connected the husband

38
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:28,004
and united him with the wife!

39
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,921
Your Honour! The judgement?

40
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,129
See, that is the judgement!

41
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:33,337
She won the case...

42
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,879
Winning the case without proof

43
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:37,004
not only in the court

44
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:38,754
but even in the media it became a sensation!

45
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,254
To solve my friend's case...

46
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:43,587
I thought she is the right person

47
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,754
and I have come to meet her!

48
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:47,004
Remove the dead leaves from there man!

49
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:54,712
Thank you.

50
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:57,171
- Hi Giri...
- Good morning madam.

51
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:58,504
Sorry, I think I kept you waiting...

52
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:00,504
Stop this acting of yours...

53
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:02,046
You always do this!

54
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:03,879
How many years have we been friends?

55
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,629
You could have called and told me!

56
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:09,962
This is my friend's personal matter,

57
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,212
his is a love & arranged marriage.

58
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,296
It was better when he was newly married...

59
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:17,253
Now they are making mountains out of molehills

60
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:18,671
and are now on the verge of getting divorced!

61
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:20,087
Come here...

62
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:22,129
They are asking for a divorce

63
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,004
but you will have to personally

64
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,421
do something and counsel them
and unite them!

65
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:30,837
Where are they?

66
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:31,837
Are they coming?

67
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:43,887
Hi!

68
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:45,887
I'm Maya.

69
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,637
Hi...

70
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:47,262
Deepak.

71
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,512
I'm Pooja.

72
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,512
You want a divorce, right?

73
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:55,304
But your friend

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,012
asked me to counsel you both

75
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,345
and wants to unite you!

76
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:00,637
I don't know what to do...

77
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:01,845
Giri, what is this!?

78
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,929
No I... Not like that...

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,262
Are you playing the fool?!

80
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:04,887
No dude, I...

81
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:05,762
I trusted you as a friend

82
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:06,762
and you are cheating me properly!

83
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:08,720
After all, he is your friend...

84
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,179
He knows how to cheat very well!

85
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:11,512
When he was my friend,
he was nice only,

86
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:12,387
since I introduced you to him,

87
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,470
he's started behaving like you!

88
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,345
You don't talk so much!

89
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:15,470
You too don't talk so much! Keep...

90
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,804
It's fine if you fight over one thing

91
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:19,762
but you are fighting over every single thing!

92
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:20,304
Fine, leave it!

93
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:20,845
It's my mistake only!

94
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:21,220
Sorry!

95
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,512
See, how you guys have united to berate me!

96
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:25,345
Hello, look...

97
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,137
Giri has said nothing wrong,

98
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,845
he meant well when he told me

99
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:31,429
but whatever be the relationship

100
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:33,220
there should not be double speak!

101
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:35,095
So... Till you get the divorce,

102
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,303
I would like all of us

103
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,595
to be honest with each other...

104
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:39,179
Okay!

105
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:39,637
Okay!

106
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:41,679
Instead of being a lawyer,

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,012
become a Guru in some Ashram

108
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,095
you give good sermons!

109
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,512
You're still here?

110
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:47,887
That's what,
my friend's case and everything...

111
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:48,262
Look...

112
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:50,887
The footwear is worn till the house

113
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:52,262
not inside them!

114
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:53,595
Understood ma'am.

115
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:54,679
Okay!

116
00:04:59,137 --> 00:04:59,595
So...

117
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,054
If I have to understand you,

118
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,845
I have to know everything about you!

119
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:04,345
That means...

120
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,304
From the scratch!

121
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,595
Madam...

122
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,804
If you tell me where to sign
the divorce application

123
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:09,804
I'll sign and go...

124
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:10,762
Let's start the procedure!

125
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:11,220
Look...

126
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,345
Pooja and Deepak want a divorce

127
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,554
all the judges in the world won't be waiting!

128
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,012
Without knowing everything about you,

129
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,095
I cannot file the case!

130
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:18,762
Not just me...

131
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:20,595
No one in the world can!

132
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:21,512
So...

133
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,429
If you are convinced you can stay,

134
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:24,470
if not...

135
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:25,845
The door is open!

136
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:27,054
Madam I will tell...

137
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:29,637
Madam...

138
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,470
After I got married,
if you know what difficulty I faced...

139
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:32,595
not just for the two of us

140
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:33,845
for every couple in the city

141
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:34,637
you will file divorce!

142
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:35,595
Then even I will talk...

143
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:36,220
I will talk!

144
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:36,970
I will talk!

145
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:37,720
- I will talk!
- I will talk!

146
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:38,554
Please...

147
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,429
The two of you don't have to be together...

148
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,887
You wait in this room

149
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,220
and you wait in that room...

150
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:44,012
I will come.

151
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:01,887
Hi Pooja...

152
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:03,554
Deepak...

153
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:05,804
Try to be comfortable,

154
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:07,845
make yourself at home please!

155
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,345
If you want anything

156
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:10,470
like coffee, tea

157
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,512
anything you want

158
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:12,304
please let me know...

159
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:12,970
I will arrange for it.

160
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:16,970
I'll record everything you say on this.

161
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:19,262
So...

162
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,429
You may begin now.

163
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:26,012
I am Pooja.

164
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:26,929
My name is Deepak.

165
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,054
I am a fashion designer.

166
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:28,970
Software engineer.

167
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:29,595
One minute!

168
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,304
One minute!

169
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,262
I said...

170
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,095
That I want to know everything about you...

171
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:35,304
That means from the scratch!

172
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:37,845
Your father, your mother,

173
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:38,679
your background,

174
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:39,512
where you were born,

175
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:40,762
where you grew up, that much...

176
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,012
I need to know everything!

177
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:44,679
Because I am not just your lawyer...

178
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:46,387
I'm asking as your family counsellor

179
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,845
So, to analyze the root cause of your problem

180
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,054
I have to know all that.

181
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:51,512
It won't work!

182
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,679
To know everything,

183
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,345
convince us and do you want to solve this?

184
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:55,554
Don't try to unite us both!

185
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:56,429
To unite you both?

186
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:57,012
No.

187
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:58,679
To convince the judge

188
00:06:58,762 --> 00:07:00,679
and I will try to get you the divorce quickly!

189
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:04,095
Are you okay with that?

190
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:08,012
Continue...

191
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,262
My father is Balappa Sharanappa.

192
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:11,970
Yes dude!

193
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:14,429
He is from North Karnataka

194
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:16,262
Unable to live there,

195
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,262
he came to Mandya.

196
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,304
As he had a banana in his name itself,

197
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,179
he started working in
the Banana Wholesale Market.

198
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:23,179
There is no grass that the sheep has not tasted

199
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,012
and no trade that my father has not indulged in!

200
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:31,637
My grandfather on seeing his growth

201
00:07:32,387 --> 00:07:34,845
Got my mother married to him.

202
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,720
My father is from Mangaluru

203
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,554
but he settled in Chikmagaluru.

204
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,679
My grandfather had a lot of property.

205
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,887
All my relatives wanted to cheat my dad

206
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,012
and tried to snatch it,

207
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,262
but my father doubled the property.

208
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,012
Financially however well my father was

209
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:02,637
his mouth was not chaste!

210
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,304
Because...

00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:05,804
Somehow...

213
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,304
My son found a girl aged forty years.

214
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:09,637
If you had waited ten more years

215
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,387
then you could have taken
a grand-daughter too man!

216
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,762
What an ass!

217
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:15,054
Oh! Crap!

218
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,012
It's Seegehalli Saroja!

219
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:16,887
Do you know her?

220
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,012
You have been saved dude!

221
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,304
In the next village,

222
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:21,387
it's called Chembunayakanahalli or something,

223
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:21,929
isn't that so?

224
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,387
There's a Saroja there!

225
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,720
What do I say about her!

[Muffled Sounds]

227
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,054
Why dude?!

228
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:35,054
A month ago...

229
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:36,470
The one who has settled in Seegehalli...

230
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:37,637
That Saroja is this one only!

231
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:38,970
The wedding is cancelled!

232
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:39,554
Let's go!

233
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:40,887
I told you so many times,
you did not heed my words!

234
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,012
Yes dear! It is true.

235
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:47,095
Your very birth is of no use!
After mucking up royally...

236
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:47,845
What!?

237
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:49,720
Your mother hits your father!?

238
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,304
What does he do in retaliation?

239
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:54,512
What does he do?

240
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:57,595
Acting as if nothing has happened,

241
00:08:58,262 --> 00:08:59,095
he simply walks away.

242
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:04,929
My dad is very cool.

243
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,429
Your son roams all over

244
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:07,762
and is getting wasted no dude!

245
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:08,928
Who merit does he have

246
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,387
for us to marry our daughter to him?!

247
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,387
But he has only one weakness...

248
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,220
If your son had money,

249
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,220
even if he had a torn face like this,

250
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,137
I would have given him my daughter!

251
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:20,929
Whose face is torn dude?!

252
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:23,345
Is the torn face mine?

253

Dear daughter!

At a very young age

266
00:09:58,845 --> 00:09:59,595
I lost my mother.

00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:03,262

I am more than life to him!

My mother is a proper
true-blue Mandya Landlady!

Local...

272
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,470
This is why my father,

273
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:18,679
being an outsider,

274
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:19,720
could not say anything and kept quiet.

275
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:20,720
That means...

00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:22,554
in your father's life,

277
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:24,637
your mother plays havoc, I think!

278
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:26,512
That was during the era of the Nokia mobile...

00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:28,387
After the Apple phone came my mother

280
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,345
became a gadget freak!

281

What?

282
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,012
After that all her games

283
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,220
were with the Apple phone!

284
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:34,845
What are you saying?

285
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,595
Hey Alexa!

288
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,512
If it rains
it will be very difficult!

289
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:45,387
Don't worry!

290
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:46,470
It's a sunny day,

291
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:47,262
carry on!

292
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:49,512
Cool!

293
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,970
Are you serious!?

294
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,762
How?

295
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,637
Her sister is in the United States of America...

296
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,220
For her grandchildren to know Indian culture
Is that so child! All this is there?

297
00:10:57,262 --> 00:10:58,512
- She keeps sending all this!
- Super!!!

298
00:10:58,595 --> 00:10:59,512
Teaming up with them...

299
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,304
She's like this!

300
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,137
My mother's latest peeve is that

301
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:05,470
in our town, there is no Swiggy or Zomato!

302
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:08,470
Really?

303
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,762
As she could not study English

304
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,220
so she sent me to the Convent!

305
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:14,220
After finishing my studies

306
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,179
I came to Bengaluru...

307
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:16,720
I got a job in a good company too...

308
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:17,887
Got an abundant salary

309
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:18,970
and good friends.

310
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,429
On the week days...

311
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:21,679
I used to work really hard!

312
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,762
But during the weekends...

313
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,929
My life was perfect...

314
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:54,137
And it was...

315
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:55,845
My life!

316
00:11:58,262 --> 00:11:59,679
Even though we both lived in the same city

317
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,137
but I grew up in the hostel...

318
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,387
For that my father had a logic...

319
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:04,845
Look here dear...

320
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:06,595
For you...

321
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:10,845
If you think 'My father is here for me!'

322
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,762
You will win only one battle!

323
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:19,720
But if you rely only on yourself...

324
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:24,804
You will win the whole world!

325
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:30,262
Remember this...

326
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,387
I have always been independent...

327
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:43,054
But my father invested in my boutique...

328
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,595
He made me financially independent.

329
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:49,387
But any day, whatever problems I faced,

330
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:50,720
I never went to my father,

331
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:52,512
cause I can handle myself!

332
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,054
I was completely independent...

333
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:56,095
And those where the best days of my life!

334
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:57,970
Interesting...

335
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,512
So one is from Chikmagaluru

336
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:00,845
and another from Mandya

337
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,012
Both have different cultures...

338
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,304
So how did your story begin?

339
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,304
Fate!

340
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:10,554
Destiny!

341
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:18,179
No dear, tell me when have I ever lied to you?

342
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:19,137
No!

343
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:19,595
Hi! Giri...

344
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,970
Wife! Wife! Wife!

345
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:23,387
Ramya was calling you then dude!

346
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,179
You get married

347
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:25,887
and you will realize

348
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,054
what my difficulty is!

349
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,595
Hello!

350
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:30,470
Where are you dear?

351
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:32,220
Mama, I just reached the office.

352
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:34,804
Why so late?

353
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:37,179
I had some work at home,

354
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,095
it got a little late.

355
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:38,637
Good morning sir.

356
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,887
That's why I've been telling you...

357
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:42,220
Get married fast!

358
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:42,762
Mother...

359
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:45,970
For that, you don't try to
get me married to a village girl!

360
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,595
If I get married,
it will only be to a girl from the city!

361
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,054
You can't stay there

362
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,345
and look at girls here

363
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,887
let's postpone the wedding for two years,
leave it!

364
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,095
What is this, my son?

365
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:55,637
What age are you in?

366
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,679
The iPhone itself is getting updated annually

367
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,220
and you're talking like a Nokia basic model...

368
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,387
This is a remote world!

369
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:04,345
Remote world!

370
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,887
I don't have to come there and search for girls.

371
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,304
Sitting here

372
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,970
I can operate everything.

373
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:11,387
Did you know dear

374
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,095
in a matrimony agency

375
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:14,929
I have taken a platinum membership!

376
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,887
The introductory offer they gave 25% discount!

377
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,345
Along with that...

378
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,053
For using HDFC Card

379
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:23,054
they gave another 20% discount!

380
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,387
Look here son,

381
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,220
listen to what I say!

382
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:28,637
The ID and password I will send in Whatsapp

383
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,220
or Telegram...

384
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:30,887
No need...
Why all these?

385
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,679
These are all outdated!

386
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,720
Insta, Snapchat...

387
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,470
Or Tinder inbox is there right?

388
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,804
I'll send it there!

389
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,762
You see...

390
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:39,804
Understood?

391
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:40,637
Bye, bye, bye, bye!

392
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,387
Bye!

393
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:08,679
Deepak.

394
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:09,720
Sir.

395
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:11,304
Yes, coming sir...

396
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:17,345
The project target time has come

397
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:19,470
we are running short of time.

398
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:20,929
Speed up!

399
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,595
And inform the team too

400
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:23,512
Okay?

401
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:23,970
Okay sir...

402
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:28,887
Stop looking at your phone and work dude!

403
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,387
Okay sir!

404
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,220
So many missed calls?

405
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:33,429
My fans have increased!

406
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,137
On the hangers, you...

407
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:39,179
Hello.

408
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:40,429
I got a missed call from this number...

409
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:41,220
Are you Deepak?

410
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,220
Yes?

411
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:43,012
From Oriental?

412
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:44,262
Yes, I am working at Oriental.

413
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,720
How senseless you people are?

414
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,679
Even to an extent isn't your family cultured?

415
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:49,345
What school did you all study in?

416
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,845
What did you all go to school and learn?

417
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:51,554
Why madam?

418
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:54,470
Initially you spoke so sweetly

419
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:56,012
and now you're grinding me like this?

420
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,470
Your mother's name is Kamla right?

421
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,345
Your mother even before the marriage

422
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:01,387
tried to make me a mother...

423
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,679
She saw my profile on the matrimonial site,
I believe...

424
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,970
She called me and said...

425
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:07,929
Now dating, chatting and meeting
have become very outdated

426
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:10,970
have a live in relationship with my son for a week.

427
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,262
Is she your mother or your pimp?

428
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:16,762
My mother is like that...

429
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,429
If I ask her to chill at home

430
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,304
She acts like she is Elon Musk's cousin sister!

431
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:22,887
On her behalf,

432
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll say sorry madam.

433
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:25,179
Only because you're saying sorry

434
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:25,887
I'm sparing you...

435
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,387
Otherwise, I would have filed a police complaint!

436
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,595
Madam for minor things like this,

437
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:29,429
why a complaint...

438
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:30,595
One minute madam!

439
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:31,595
I'm getting another call...

440
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:32,887
No...

441
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:34,387
Not for you, for me...

442
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:37,304
Someone called Sadhu Belliappa...

443
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:38,679
What!?

444
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:40,137
Sadhu Belliappa!?

445
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:41,054
That's my father!

446
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:42,262
We have to work it out and try!

447
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:42,679
Really?

448
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,762
Why is he calling you?

449
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:45,220
How would I know!

450
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:46,720
Don't tell him that I am here...

451
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,054
Take him on a conference call.

452
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:48,595
Yes madam.

453
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:51,762
Hello...

454
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:53,095
I am Sadhu Belliappa.

455
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,929
I'm speaking from Chikkamagaluru.

456
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:59,012
Seeing my daughter's matrimony profile

457
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:00,554
your mother called me.

458
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,137
Such humility, such humility!

459
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:07,387
Such culture, such character your mother has...

460
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,554
In this day and age of dating and chatting...

461
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,679
Without even meeting your mother
approved my daughter!

462
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,387
If you want, I'll convince her!

463
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:18,595
One minute, stay in the call...

464
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,679
I'll connect her also.

465
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,012
Daddy...

466
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:22,637
Daughter!?

467
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,262
You're there only!?

468
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,637
Before I connected, it's been connected!

469
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:28,595
Very good! Very good!

470
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:29,262
All the best!

471
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,845
If both of you meet up and agree
Papa...

472
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:33,387
I will fix the marriage!

473
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,262
- Okay!
- Papa...

474
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,304
Daughter, all the best!

475
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:36,929
- Son-in-law! All the best!
- Papa... Papa...

476
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,929
- Hello!
- I will disconnect the call.

477
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,679
I won't be able to say no to my father.

478
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:42,595
To my mother,

479
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:43,845
even if I say no, she won't let me!

480
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:45,012
Fine!

481
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:46,554
Then let's meet this weekend...

482
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,595
We'll meet at 12:30 at King's Club.

483
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,262
Done!

484
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:50,387
Okay.

485
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:57,054
Mother...

486
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:57,554
Son...

487
00:17:58,262 --> 00:17:59,595
Did you like the girl?

488
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:01,887
When shall we have the wedding?

489
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:03,720
Mother, one minute...

490
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,595
There were so many girls here,

491
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,220
how did you know that I like her only?

492
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:07,970
No dear...

493
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:09,762
When you see the profile...

494
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,637
Won't it show here as 'viewed' to me?

495
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,429
Dunno how that they have given you a job and

496
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,929
lakhs and lakhs as salary!

497
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,762
Enjoy your life son...

498
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:20,887
Life is beautiful!

499
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:22,345
Fine, thank you.

500
00:18:35,137 --> 00:18:36,345
Another time my mother

501
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,512
shouldn't even talk about my marriage.

502
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,679
The torture I will give her tomorrow...

503
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,137
She shouldn't show me another girl!

504
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:48,054
I'll do like that!

505
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,554
Hello madam...

506
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,387
Menu.

507
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:12,429
Sir is coming, please wait.

508
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:14,554
Okay!

509
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:20,012
Dude, give the bill quickly!

510
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:20,679
Am I not giving?!

511
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:21,720
Get it ready soon!

512
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:22,387
- Okay.
- I'll come!

513
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:25,387
Madam, menu...

514
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:26,345
Did it get ready?

515
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:27,762
Sir will come, wait man!

516
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:29,845
- What about yesterday's?
- Okay ma'am.

517
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,137
I am getting the slip ready, wait!

518
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:47,387
Hi.

519
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:49,429
Fine, I am giving it.

520
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,220
We planned to meet at 12:30.

521
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:53,095
I came on time!

522
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:54,845
In this country

523
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:55,970
if we go at the agreed time

524
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,095
they will think that we are jobless!

525
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:58,720
You are lucky...

526
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,429
I made you wait only one hour!

527
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,887
I make my friends wait for 3-4 hours minimum!

528
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:06,887
Ma'am, menu.

529
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:07,845
I need a little time.

530
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:09,470
I need it now.

531
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:10,054
Yes sir.

532
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:10,887
Shall we talk a little.

533
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,845
Let's talk.

534
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,219
Actually, when it comes to food and opportunity

535
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,887
we should grab it!

536
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:15,804
I'm a foodie, you know...

537
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:17,220
In my house

538
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:18,887
more than my alarm

539
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,137
I have woken up more to
my mother's cooker whistle!

540
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,637
First we'll eat and then we'll talk.

541
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,095
Give it sonny.

542
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,845
He has made it so expensive!

543
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:33,095
Two buffets.

544
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,720
Okay sir.

545
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:34,929
The buffet order is yours...

546
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,179
I will order whatever I want.

547
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,637
Do it.

548
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:41,387
One Chicken Biryani,

549
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:43,095
one Chicken Kebab,

550
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,012
one Mutton Dry,

551
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,429
one Fried Rice,

552
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:47,970
one Manchurian,

553
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:49,429
one Dessert,

554
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,804
one Lassi,

555
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:53,637
one Lemonade

556
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:55,137
And one Jamoon.

557
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:55,970
Okay ma'am.

558
00:20:58,304 --> 00:20:59,428
If I marry her,

559
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:00,387
my salary won't be enough...

560
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,054
I'll have to take a loan to take care of her.

561
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,637
In one meal she is
fleecing me of ten thousand!

562
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,679
I'll have to make her pay the bill!

563
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,887
Madam...

564
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:17,845
Go and come.

565
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,429
Give me one Lassi...

566
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:25,595
- Fast!
- Dude...

567
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:26,679
Sir?

568
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,429
I will give you 500 rupees,

569
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:29,262
this bill...

570
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:30,220
Take it from her.

571
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:31,720
I don't want it sir.

572
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:32,845
Why my boy?

573
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:33,804
Sir,

574
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:35,470
taking girls to restaurants,

575
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,679
and paying all the time!

576
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,429
Today...

577
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,054
I have ended up working in this restaurant sir!

578
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,137
Sir,

579
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:41,470
boys must stand by boys!

580
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,512
What now?

581
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:44,095
The bill should be paid, right?

582
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,095
Just wait and watch.

583
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,179
You are a poor person's benefactor dude!

584
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:50,554
Ma'am,

585
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:51,429
here's the bill.

586
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,637
Sir is coming, please wait.

587
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:53,762
Ma'am bill.

588
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,179
Sir will come. Wait!

589
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,929
Ma'am, bill ma'am!

590
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:58,179
Sir will come. Wait!

591
00:21:58,262 --> 00:22:00,054
Did you ask him and order?

592
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,512
Like a rank student asking for
extra sheets in an exam,

593
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,387
you ordered extra chutney, extra sauce,

594
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,387
you asked for everything and took it!

595
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:07,012
Now are you playing games?

596
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,012
The counter is closing.

597
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:09,304
Wait, wait, wait!

598
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:09,887
I will give it to you.

599
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:19,929
How much is the bill dude?

600
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:21,470
Madam gave it sir.

601
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:23,429
You first give it back to her!

602
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,762
Take this.

603
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:24,637
Swipe from mine, swipe, swipe...

604
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,095
Take it!

605
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,137
What are you sir?

606
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,554
If I ask you to regurgitate
what you have eaten,

607
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,470
will you be able to regurgitate it?

608
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:29,804
Can you do it sir?

609
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:31,304
Can you do it sir?

610
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:31,720
No.

611
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:32,387
No, isn't it?

612
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:33,179
Exactly like that,

613
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:34,804
once the receipt comes,
that's it sir!

614
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:37,595
How can you take money from girls?

615
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:38,387
Go away, go away!

616
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:40,970
What is this?
He makes a girl pay the bill!

617
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,179
Madam...

618
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:45,137
Madam, madam...

619
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:45,929
Madam.

620
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:46,720
Pooja!

621
00:22:47,054 --> 00:22:47,387
I'll come.

622
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:47,679
Okay.

623
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,929
What a surprise!

624
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:49,929
Come, let's party?

625
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,387
No...

626
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,387
I had come for a meeting.

627
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:51,887
I will leave now.

628
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,554
Madam,

629
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:53,345
you said party!

630
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:54,095
Will there be booze at the party?

631
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:55,262
All the brands are available.

632
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,179
Madam,

633
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,012
please come madam.

634
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,762
It has been a while since I enjoyed free booze!

635
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:01,387
You've paid such a huge bill!

636
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,595
Let us recover some of it.

637
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:03,012
Come...

638
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:04,054
Can you keep quiet?

639
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:05,512
Madam, you tell her.

640
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:06,762
Come Pooja...

641
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:07,345
Please...

642
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,345
Come, come, come, come!

643
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:08,637
No!

644
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,929
- Please come Pooja!
- Take her... She will come.

645
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:12,387
Please...

646
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,970
Thank you.

647
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,887
You people carry on.

648
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:15,512
I'll come.

649
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:17,304
Hi Madam.

650
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:17,804
Hi...

651
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,387
Hi sir...

652
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:19,054
Hi...

653
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:20,262
Madam, what would you like to have?

654
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:20,762
One Mojito.

655
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:21,595
What about you?

656
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,054
If you look at my face, what do you feel?

657
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,137
That you would drink everything
that is available for free.

658
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,179
Then bring 1 peg each, of everything.

659
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:26,845
Okay sir...

660
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,720
Do you only drink or smoke...

661
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:37,137
Booze and cigarettes are like a couple,

662
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:38,512
they are always stuck with each other,

663
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,887
one cannot live without the other.

664
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:47,929
Hello madam!

665
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:49,512
Drink a little less.

666
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,387
Did you just see?

667
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,554
How you bumped against me?

668
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:52,637
Hello, I'm not drunk!

669
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:53,679
What!?

670
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:55,220
You haven't had any drinks?

671
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:57,679
Even without drinking to this level
if you've bumped against me,

672
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,720
do you like me so much?

673
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:00,679
Shut up and keep moving!

674
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,345
If my boyfriend comes,

675
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,220
he will thrash you all over town!

676
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,304
If your boyfriend comes,

677
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:05,637
he will thrash me all around town!

678
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:07,887
Lady, who is that punter,

679
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:08,554
that fighter?

680
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:09,595
Where?

681
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,137
This guy.

682
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,179
- Is this the guy?
- Yes, it's me!

683
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:14,554
Will you thrash me all around town?

684
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,887
Why should I thrash you around town?

685
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:19,095
I just came here for free booze.

686
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:20,429
Why are you setting me up?

687
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:22,303
Sir, nothing has happened.

688
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:23,553
She bumped into you by mistake.

689
00:24:23,554 --> 00:24:24,137
Please leave.

690
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:28,053
If I trust and get married to you,
I will be done for!

691
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:28,637
Useless!

692
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,554
Madam...

693
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:33,970
- Enough!
- Okay...

694
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:45,387
Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir!

695
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:46,470
I will tell you everything sir!

696
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:47,387
Please leave me sir.

697
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:48,179
What will you tell?

698
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:49,554
Sir,

699
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,637
all this is a drama, sir.

700
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:53,720
Drama?

701
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:54,637
Yes sir.

702
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:55,762
To this party,

703
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:57,387
the lady you brought with you!

704
00:24:57,637 --> 00:24:59,137
That too is a drama sir.

705
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:00,262
It's a set up.

706
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:01,429
Junior artist?

707
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,262
Yes sir.

708
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,345
By paying 300 rupees per head,

709
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,095
this madam

710
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,595
has set up all of them sir.

711
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,387
Whoever comes to marry her,

712
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,720
she brings them all here

713
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,095
and tests them sir.

714
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,220
Sir...

715
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,637
I am not involved in all this sir.

716
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:17,595
I have to report for shooting sir.

717
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,679
Sir, I have to go sir.

718
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,262
I have to go.

719
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,262
I have to go!

720
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:21,304
I will go!

721
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:24,637
Drama?

722
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:26,679
You fought when you met for the first time?

723
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:28,512
Then how did you come together?

724
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:29,970
Don't ask me.

725
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,095
It's a crazy drama.

726
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:32,679
Actually!

727
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:33,929
Before the deluge,

728
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,387
I believe God gives a warning.

729
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:36,970
We should pay attention to it,

730
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:38,594
if we ignore it,

731
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:39,262
life will be like...

732
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,429
It will get spoilt.

733
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,637
Why hasn't my mother called me?

734
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:49,762
Mickey mouse!

735
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:51,137
Run, run, run!

736
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,970
Hello... Tell me son!

737
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,053
Dad... Why is the house so silent?

738
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:57,762
Is mom not around?

739
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:01,387
Your mother is in mourning.

740
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,970
I'm in a joyful celebration mode.

741
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,220
Don't know whose daughter she was,

742
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,137
in Northern Karnataka

743
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:09,719
the way people eat pan parag and gutkha

744
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
and spit it out vigorously...

745
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,512
That is how she spat at her!

746
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:15,262
She is sitting in a corner.

747
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:16,386
Has not eaten breakfast or lunch!

748
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:18,054
She is sitting silently like a ghost.

749
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:18,762
Look son,

750
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,679
I don't know what you will do

751
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,304
but that girl must become
the daughter-in-law of our house.

752
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:23,887
Okay?

753
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,054
Dad, give the phone to mom for a minute.

754
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:26,637
Okay, okay!

755
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:28,054
To your mother?

756
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:31,679
Your son dear.

757
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:32,679
Please take it.

758
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,220
Take it.

759
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,637
Deepu,

760
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,595
After the meeting I just called her
and asked her opinion

761
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,512
and that girl...

762
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:42,303
For water on the streets

763
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,970
you know how they scuffle and berate each other!

764
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:46,929
She scolded me worse than that son!

765
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:49,387
I don't know what you will do,

766
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:52,137
that girl must come and fall at my feet.

767
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:52,720
That's it!

768
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:53,637
Else,

769
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,429
I will remove my Whatsapp DP

770
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,804
and put up a sad status!

771
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:00,220
I will do it, wait mom.

772
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:27,262
Don't you want this?

773
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,137
That color is dull.

774
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:30,304
This is alright.

775
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:31,179
Let's look at that.

776
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,179
What madam...

777
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,845
Is it your boyfriend?

778
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:33,720
Take his call.

779
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:35,387
Why have you come here?

780
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:35,970
To buy clothes.

781
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,179
Then do just that,

782
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:37,845
else get out!

783
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:39,137
Come on, let's go.

784
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,345
Is this the only store?

785
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:41,720
Next time we shouldn't come here.

786
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:43,637
I told you not to come here earlier itself!

787
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:47,595
I will teach him a lesson!

788
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:50,429
If I don't pick up your call,

789
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,887
it means I don't want to talk to you.

790
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:52,554
Same with me,

791
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:53,636
if I'm calling you continuously,

792
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:54,595
it means I want to discuss something.

793
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:55,470
Are you Shreya Ghoshal

794
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:56,845
that I'd want to hear your voice again and again?

795
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:57,887
Yes! That's why.

796
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:58,762
Don't call me.

797
00:27:58,887 --> 00:27:59,970
I have no interest in talking to you.

798
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,179
I'm busy in Madikeri.

799
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,512
Do not call me!

800
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:03,345
Hello, hello, hello, hello!

801
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,387
I'm in the same Madikeri that you are in.

802
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:07,179
What!?

803
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,262
Turn a little to your left please!

804
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,262
Why madam?

805
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,762
I believe you called my mother
and abused her.

806
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:21,720
At least, you only call and torture me.

807
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:22,929
But your mother...
She is next level!

808
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:24,512
Not only Whatsapp and Facebook.

809
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:27,345
She is messaging me on
Phone Pe, Gpay and Paytm

810
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:28,679
asking me if I liked her son!

811
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:30,762
That is the love my mom has for me.

812
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,012
How will you understand that?

813
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,429
You are the kind that tests boys like vehicles.

814
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:36,137
Yes... I will test.

815
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:36,929
How does that bother you?

816
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,970
In the test you conduct,

817
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:39,304
you will only know pass or fail...

818
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,012
By chance if I pass,

819
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,387
you will have another test
to figure out how I passed.

820
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,054
In this world
there are no boys who will be 100% perfect.

821
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:47,262
By chance you get one,

822
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:48,220
they will only be 50% right,

823
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:50,179
the other 50% we have to compromise!

824
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,887
Look I will tell you something,

825
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:52,929
listen to me properly...

826
00:28:53,637 --> 00:28:54,679
If you talk to someone

827
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,470
and feel like you want
to keep talking to them,

828
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:57,845
if you see someone

829
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,179
and want to continue seeing them,

830
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,137
if you feel very comfortable
in someone's company,

831
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:03,845
they are your real-life partner!

832
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:07,762
You cannot test and get them
by searching like this!

833
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,512
Hello!

834
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,429
So according to you...

835
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:14,679
I will never be able to find
the kind of guy I'm looking for?

836
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:16,637
There is no chance.

837
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:18,679
Watch me!

838
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
I will find a guy exactly like
the one I'm looking for,

839
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,179
make a raw almond reel with him
and send it to you.

840
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,054
Watch it and feel envious!

841
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,595
Almond challenge!

842
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:29,637
Fine!

843
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:30,679
Challenge!

844
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:31,762
I will see.

845
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,595
<i>Almond! Almond!</i>
Almond! Almond!

846
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:35,720
<i>Almond! Almond!</i>

847
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,803
I already have a large car company.

848
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:42,554
For that car company,
I'm the sole proprie...

849
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:44,887
When you see someone
and want to continue seeing them,

850
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,012
they really are our real-life partners.

851
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:47,637
Think about it!

852
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:48,637
Its your decision.

853
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,220
Believe it or not,

854
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:52,804
when I talk people just want to listen to me,

855
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:53,887
It's like,

856
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:54,470
my voice...

857
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:55,554
I am unable to listen to this!

858
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,845
When you talk to someone
and want to continue talking to them...

859
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,220
They really are our real-life partners.

860
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:05,554
Deepak and I

861
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,762
in the same company

862
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:08,595
have been working together since 2 years.

863
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:09,220
Okay!

864
00:30:09,262 --> 00:30:10,137
He's a very good boy.

865
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:12,470
You can surely marry him.

866
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,179
Okay.

867
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:14,304
Thank you.

868
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:24,179
If they are not around,
but we still are thinking about them,

869
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:25,387
they really are our life partners.

870
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,387
Please give me a buffet.

871
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:32,679
Sir, 2 buffets?

872
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,304
No, no. Just a buffet for me.

873
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:37,054
Please order whatever you'd like to order.

874
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:38,262
Is he enacting a drama or what!?

875
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:39,804
And in desserts...

876
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,220
By chance if I pass,

877
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,803
wondering how did I pass?

878
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:43,679
You will keep a test for that too!

879
00:30:43,804 --> 00:30:44,512
Vanilla flavor,

880
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:45,637
chocolate flavors are there sir.

881
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,929
Okay, I think that is fine for me.

882
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:48,887
That flavor is ok.

883
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:49,720
Do you want anything else sir?

884
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:51,512
- Wherever I go, he is always on my mind!
- You please ask her...

885
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:52,470
What you want...

886
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:53,637
Please check...

887
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:54,304
Okay sir!

888
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:58,179
I will go and bring some starters.

889
00:30:58,429 --> 00:30:59,387
Yes, carry on.

890
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:22,887
Did he tell I am quarrelsome?

891
00:31:23,012 --> 00:31:23,720
That I will test everything!

892
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:25,054
Whatever I am doing is a drama?

893
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:27,095
No, not at all.

894
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:28,304
Then...

895
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,887
In life when trusting a boy,

896
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:32,137
she will leave her house, parents
and everything and come.

897
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,595
If she checks out if the boy is good or bad,

898
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,887
what is wrong in that, he told!

899
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:38,012
And in such a big city

900
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:38,929
without anyone's help

901
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:39,720
if she is running a boutique,

902
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:42,095
can't she run a family?

903
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:43,345
She will make a very good wife

904
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:44,137
he told madam.

905
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,470
He told another thing after that.

906
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:46,470
Very important!

907
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:48,470
Many people will come

908
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:49,595
and many will go in life,

909
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:51,887
but with one person only...

910
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,137
We feel like spending our entire life.

911
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:56,470
If you find such a person,
you shouldn't let go.

912
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:58,845
This girl is like that girl.

913
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:00,429
Don't miss her, he told.

914
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:08,512
Wait, wait, wait!

915
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,345
Whatever you told him,
is it true?

916
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,762
Indeed, it is true!

917
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:17,387
Tell her it is true sir!

918
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:21,845
Your opinion about me,
is it the same?

919
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:24,179
Is it not so?

920
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,012
Whatever is in the mind comes from the mouth!

921
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:27,679
Tell her sir.

922
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:31,429
Actually, I overacted a bit...

923
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:32,720
So...

924
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,429
I am really sorry!

925
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:38,137
People with a pure heart only sir

926
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,679
have the magnanimity of asking for forgiveness madam!

927
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:41,929
Sir, you leave it sir,

928
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:42,762
you are super!

929
00:32:43,387 --> 00:32:43,970
Actually...

930
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,262
You had told me that day

931
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:46,594
that when you see someone,

932
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:48,054
you should feel like seeing them only,

933
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:49,511
when you talk to someone

934
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:51,137
you should feel like talking to them only,

935
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,719
when you are with someone

936
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,970
you should want to keep being with them,

937
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:55,304
when you are not together

938
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:56,095
you should miss them!

939
00:32:56,387 --> 00:32:59,262
Now I am feeling all that...

940
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:00,595
You have to feel that...

941
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:02,512
When you see a good boy like me

942
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:04,887
you should feel like that...

943
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,262
With the same happiness give me a hug!

944
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:07,054
Come...

945
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:08,012
Come...

946
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,470
Madam, madam, madam, madam!

947
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:15,970
Madam, what are you doing?

948
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:16,637
Come...

949
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,762
You got confused and instead of me,

950
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:19,929
you hugged him!

951
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:22,720
It's me that you came to see, isn't it?

952
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:23,887
Come hug me!

953
00:33:24,095 --> 00:33:24,720
Come on, come on, come on!

954
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,345
Hug me!

955
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:27,137
She will hug me!

956
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:28,054
Bye!

957
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:57,887
<i>When you have been secured,</i>

958
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:00,220
<i>For other dreams...</i>

959
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,512
<i>Where is the space?</i>

960
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,470
<i>Oh! Life!</i>

961
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,929
<i>All my tomorrows...</i>

962
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:10,345
<i>Are with you only!</i>

963
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,554
<i>My life is reserved for you!</i>

964
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:15,179
<i>Oh! Life!</i>

965
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,512
<i>The only thing left is for me to go mad...</i>

966
00:34:18,554 --> 00:34:20,512
<i>When in such a state of joy!</i>

967
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,012
<i>That you are mine forever...</i>

968
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,387
<i>My heart is bursting with pride!</i>

969
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:27,429
<i>In all of your moments...</i>

970
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,762
<i>Let me partake of them!</i>

971
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:33,137
<i>When you have been secured,</i>

972
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,679
<i>For other dreams...</i>

973
00:34:36,304 --> 00:34:37,929
<i>Where is the space?</i>

974
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:40,095
<i>Oh! Life!</i>

975
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:43,470
Actually, you know what...

976
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,054
To build our own home on top a hill

977
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:46,679
and settle there only is a huge desire!

978
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:47,512
On the Mountain!

979
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,762
Likewise, for us to roam about

980
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:51,679
we should buy a small cute car!

981
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,137
When we enter our house

982
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,179
in the foyer,

983
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,804
there should be a big portrait of Ganesha!

984
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:02,220
Our best memories

985
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:03,720
should be displayed in a photo gallery!

986
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,179
Our living, dining, kitchen should be open

987
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,345
and our bedroom

988
00:35:09,595 --> 00:35:10,970
should be romantic!

989
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:12,470
Everything should be in blue!

990
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,929
There should be a Home-theatre at home,

991
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:15,762
you and I

992
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:16,637
should sit on weekends

993
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,054
and watch a good movie...

994
00:35:18,262 --> 00:35:18,929
With popcorn!

995
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,637
<i>Our hearts have intermingled...</i>

996
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:29,012
<i>Our song is the one only!</i>

997
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:31,470
<i>By earning, saving, come let's build!</i>

998
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,012
<i>Our own little nest!</i>

999
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:35,429
<i>Pain or joy...</i>

1000
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:36,887
<i>Whatever it may be...</i>

1001
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,929
<i>Give me an equal share!</i>

1002
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,637
<i>Let the happiness, boredom be equal.</i>

1003
00:35:42,262 --> 00:35:43,887
<i>Let them be too!</i>

1004
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:46,345
<i>You should give sweet kisses...</i>

1005
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:48,845
<i>A hundred every hour!</i>

1006
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:50,970
<i>You should ask for forgiveness</i>

1007
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:53,929
<i>Whosever mistake it may be!</i>

1008
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:56,512
<i>Always together everywhere...</i>

1009
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,637
<i>Our names should be seen!</i>

1010
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:01,637
<i>When you have been secured,</i>

1011
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,095
<i>For other dreams...</i>

1012
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,179
<i>Where is the space?</i>

1013
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:08,512
<i>Oh! Life!</i>

1014
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:11,929
<i>All my tomorrows...</i>

1015
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:14,054
<i>Are with you only!</i>

1016
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:16,179
<i>My life is reserved for you!</i>

1017
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:18,804
<i>Oh! Life!</i>

1018
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:24,637
Bye!

1019
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:25,637
Be careful!

1020
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:35,637
<i>My thoughts and prayers</i>

1021
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,804
<i>They all are yours!</i>

1022
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:39,720
[Humming continues]

1023
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:43,012
Isn't this drive wonderful?

1024
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:45,179
Deep!

1025
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:46,970
Shall we eat on the way somewhere?

1026
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:49,095
Or shall we cook and eat at the flat?

1027
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:50,887
Let's cook and eat, it will be fun!

1028
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:53,179
Are all the groceries there in your flat?

1029
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:54,762
In my flat?

1030
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,512
Groceries, is it?

1031
00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:57,887
Poo...

1032
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:00,012
Your flat is bigger than mine,
isn't it?

1033
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,345
So I thought it will be convenient for you,

1034
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,095
I sold my flat!

1035
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,679
What!

1036
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:05,720
You sold it?

1037
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,179
I too have vacated my flat!

1038
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:09,095
Poo,

1039
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:10,262
whom did you ask before vacating?

1040
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:11,554
At least did you inform me before?

1041
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:13,345
Why I have to inform you Deep?

1042
00:37:13,554 --> 00:37:15,387
I will anyway come to your house
after marriage,

1043
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:16,679
It's your responsibility, right?

1044
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,929
Where do we go now!?

1045
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:25,179
Poo, my friend has a flat,

1046
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:26,512
let's do one thing!

1047
00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:27,637
We will stay there today

1048
00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:29,179
and tomorrow I will make
some arrangements!

1049
00:37:29,304 --> 00:37:31,095
First day itself we have to stay
in your friend's house!

1050
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,012
Ridiculous!

1051
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,012
I cannot stay there Deep!

1052
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:34,512
Only one day you have to adjust!

1053
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:35,262
- Please...
- No Deep, I can't!

1054
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:36,137
Just one day!

1055
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:36,970
Please Deep,

1056
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,011
can you please turn the car?

1057
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:38,679
We shall go back.

1058
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:55,637
Why have you brought me here?

1059
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:57,178
Won't I be uncomfortable here?

1060
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,219
Nothing like that will happen, come!

1061
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,679
Just for a day!

1062
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Why are you forcing me?

1063
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,470
I don't like this one bit!

1064
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:02,637
Please, come.

1065
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:04,845
This is my friend's house.

1066
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,637
My friend is a staunch admirer of
Kannada language!

1067
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:10,345
That's why, see here...

1068
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:11,637
To show that he reads Kannada newspapers

1069
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:12,554
he has displayed the Kannada newspaper.

1070
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:14,304
Is this a joke?

1071
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:15,679
This seems to be a joke to you,

1072
00:38:16,262 --> 00:38:17,054
do you feel it's a joke?

1073
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:34,929
Enter your password!

1074
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:14,595
Bro, be careful!

1075
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:15,345
Go!

1076
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:47,429
<i>In your sparkling eyes...</i>

1077
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:48,845
<i>The expanse of light!</i>

1078
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,554
<i>Is mine from now on!</i>

1079
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,095
<i>Oh! Boy!</i>

1080
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:54,720
<i>Oh! My sweetheart!</i>

1081
00:39:56,512 --> 00:39:58,262
<i>Your whispering words</i>

1082
00:39:58,345 --> 00:39:59,470
<i>And my longing for them</i>

1083
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:01,095
<i>I don't see the end to it!</i>

1084
00:40:01,304 --> 00:40:02,470
<i>Oh! Boy!</i>

1085
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,179
<i>Oh! My sweetheart!</i>

1086
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:10,054
<i>I will give you space in my lap...</i>

1087
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:12,595
<i>I will become a child!</i>

1088
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,470
<i>Below your crossed feet...</i>

1089
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,804
<i>I will keep my heart!</i>

1090
00:40:17,887 --> 00:40:21,095
<i>From now, I will be with you,</i>

1091
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:23,054
<i>Forever & ever!</i>

1092
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,470
<i>You are from my intoxication!</i>

1093
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:38,137
<i>In your sparkling eyes...</i>

1094
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:39,595
<i>The expanse of light!</i>

1095
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,387
<i>Is mine from now on!</i>

1096
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,637
<i>Oh! Boy!</i>

1097
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,470
<i>Oh! My sweetheart!</i>

1098
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:52,845
This place is ours!

1099
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:53,470
What?

1100
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:54,845
Ours?

1101
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:55,720
Seriously?

1102
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:57,512
You wanted a home on the mountain, right?

1103
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,429
Build it!

1104
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,762
Thank you!

1105
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:02,804
The entrance should face this side...

1106
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,804
It should have a hut shaped roof!

1107
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:04,887
The sunlight falls here,

1108
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:05,887
let the window face this side.

1109
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:06,887
Let's have a garden all over here.

1110
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:23,720
Online business is a trend!

1111
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:25,929
<i>In your being, my...</i>

1112
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:29,012
<i>Happiness is enclosed!</i>

1113
00:41:29,262 --> 00:41:32,137
<i>In myriad ways, you held me...</i>

1114
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,345
<i>How you cuddled up to me, I remember!</i>

1115
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:36,595
<i>You are my father!</i>

1116
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:39,220
<i>You are my mother!</i>

1117
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:41,970
<i>You are my everything!</i>

1118
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:44,387
<i>I feel so...</i>

1119
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:47,470
<i>What cannot be seen even in dreams,</i>

1120
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,970
<i>To that wonderful world!</i>

1121
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,970
<i>Your fond love that beckons to me!</i>

1122
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,137
<i>Is there a comparison?</i>

1123
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,345
<i>From now, I will be with you,</i>

1124
00:41:58,595 --> 00:42:00,220
<i>Forever & ever!</i>

1125
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,762
<i>You are my intoxication!</i>

1126
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,137
<i>In your sparkling eyes...</i>

1127
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,554
<i>The expanse of light!</i>

1128
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,137
<i>Is mine from now on!</i>

1129
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:10,345
<i>Oh! Boy!</i>

1130
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:13,929
<i>Oh! My sweetheart!</i>

1131
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:21,262
Everything looks so perfect!

1132
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:22,762
According to you,

1133
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:24,220
Where do you think it went wrong?

1134
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,554
So now it is the last saree for today!

1135
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,345
Saree number 20.

1136
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:36,345
It is a beautiful, beautiful
combination of grey and blue.

1137
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,262
This is a customized saree.

1138
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:41,054
So, this saree costs ₹3999/-

1139
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:43,637
Tomorrow I shall come back
with my new collection.

1140
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:44,970
Till then, see you guys!

1141
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:51,804
Poo...

1142
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:52,429
Yes.

1143
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:54,095
Can I get a glass of coffee please?

1144
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,304
Even I'm tired after my work since then!

1145
00:42:56,762 --> 00:42:58,095
You are asking me for coffee?

1146
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,054
How selfish!

1147
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:02,470
Sorry!

1148
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,429
Yes, please come!

1149
00:43:11,595 --> 00:43:12,012
Keep it here!

1150
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:13,137
What order is it?

1151
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:17,554
You have ordered something.

1152
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,220
I did it yesterday,

1153
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,387
- bean bag!
- Is it?

1154
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:21,262
Red, is it?

1155
00:43:21,304 --> 00:43:22,512
Isn't it superb?

1156
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:23,345
No, it is useless!

1157
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:24,679
Doesn't suit the house Deep!

1158
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:25,970
Sir!

1159
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:27,554
Wait a minute please!

1160
00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:29,387
Poo...

1161
00:43:29,637 --> 00:43:31,636
You were struggling to cut your nails, right?

1162
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:32,512
So, I got it with love!

1163
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:33,429
In the name of love,

1164
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,262
don't try to convince me!

1165
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:35,137
I didn't like it.

1166
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:36,762
Sir, bill!

1167
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:37,720
Stay quiet please,

1168
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:38,637
ma'am is throwing arrows at me

1169
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:39,345
and you are talking about bill!

1170
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:41,220
Poo, the salary has been remitted, right?

1171
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:42,429
I had to get you some gift,

1172
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:43,595
hence I got it, that's all!

1173
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:44,637
It's okay to get a gift,

1174
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:46,095
but I too must like the gift, right?

1175
00:43:46,387 --> 00:43:47,637
If you buy something that you like!?

1176
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:49,762
If I didn't like the gift at all,

1177
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:51,220
for me,
it doesn't make any sense to keep this!

1178
00:43:53,554 --> 00:43:54,470
Sir, if I take it back,

1179
00:43:54,512 --> 00:43:55,345
my boss will scold me!

1180
00:43:55,845 --> 00:43:56,387
To keep it inside,

1181
00:43:56,387 --> 00:43:57,304
my boss must allow right?

1182
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:58,220
Sir, let's do one thing sir,

1183
00:43:58,554 --> 00:43:59,637
I will call my boss and give you.

1184
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:00,804
You talk to him sir.

1185
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:07,262
Hello!

1186
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:07,679
Sir...

1187
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:08,304
It's...

1188
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:10,429
To surprise my wife,

1189
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:11,345
I had ordered

1190
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,345
but she didn't like the color.

1191
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:14,137
The one who is hurt only

1192
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:15,345
will know the pain,

1193
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:16,304
I'm married too!

1194
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:17,637
You return it,

1195
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,012
I shall repay your money.

1196
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:20,137
Thank you, sir.

1197
00:44:20,262 --> 00:44:20,887
Yes, okay!

1198
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:23,845
Sir, next time, when you book,

1199
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:24,887
ask madam and do it sir!

1200
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:40,762
Deep...

1201
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:45,262
Now...
In front of the house on the board

1202
00:44:45,637 --> 00:44:46,970
you have put both our names, isn't it?

1203
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:48,095
Why is it?

1204
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:52,095
Whatever has to be decided,

1205
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:53,595
both of us should decide that,

1206
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:55,095
isn't that right?

1207
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:11,179
The problem that started in such
a simple manner,

1208
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,137
no idea how it developed to this extent!

1209
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:13,887
Simple, is it?

1210
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:14,970
It looks complicated!

1211
00:45:16,304 --> 00:45:16,804
Yes!

1212
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:18,095
It was complicated.

1213
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,137
Poo...

1214
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,095
Your friend Maadevi...

1215
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:39,179
She's so vexed!

1216
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:40,637
Not Maadevi!

1217
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,512
Her name is Madhavi,

1218
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:42,012
Same.

1219
00:45:42,095 --> 00:45:42,929
Her husband is a big psycho!

1220
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:44,387
He tortures her a lot!

1221
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:45,637
She was very upset,

1222
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:46,679
just to give her some relief,

1223
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:47,679
we have come to this trip.

1224
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:54,262
Give me that.

1225
00:45:54,304 --> 00:45:55,095
Careful!

1226
00:45:56,637 --> 00:45:57,429
You go and get another.

1227
00:45:57,512 --> 00:45:58,179
Will you have both?

1228
00:45:58,345 --> 00:45:58,970
Take the soup.

1229
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,679
I'll come, wait!

1230
00:46:00,512 --> 00:46:01,887
- Careful!
- I'll pour it.

1231
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,220
Where is the other soup?

1232
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:12,429
You don't have to serve her soup Deep.

1233
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:14,095
If she needs,
she will go and take it herself.

1234
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:17,179
She was very sad right,

1235
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:18,095
That's why I gave her.

1236
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:19,429
What's the connection with that and you?

1237
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:20,262
Do not overact!

1238
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:21,804
Poo...

1239
00:46:22,637 --> 00:46:23,262
It's okay!

1240
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:25,012
Don't think otherwise.

1241
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:25,887
Drink it.

1242
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:27,512
You have come without
even informing me, right?

1243
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:29,012
Wherever you go, I will not spare you!

1244
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:30,470
I have come with my friends only, right?

1245
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:30,804
Who friends?

1246
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:31,220
Who's he?

1247
00:46:31,262 --> 00:46:32,429
- I haven't come alone.
- Her husband!

1248
00:46:32,595 --> 00:46:33,679
Don't spoil my head.

1249
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:34,679
I have told you before,

1250
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,887
- I will kill you!
- They are fighting!

1251
00:46:36,512 --> 00:46:36,970
Deep!

1252
00:46:37,137 --> 00:46:38,095
Where are you going?

1253
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:38,845
There's a fight going on there.

1254
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:39,595
What will you do?

1255
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:40,595
It's their personal matter.

1256
00:46:40,637 --> 00:46:41,387
They will solve it.

1257
00:46:41,637 --> 00:46:42,512
- It won't be right!
- You don't have to go!

1258
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:42,845
What won't be right?

1259
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:45,429
It isn't romance, there is a fight!

1260
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,637
How many times haven't I told you?
Don't leave home and go anywhere!

1261
00:46:49,054 --> 00:46:49,720
Are you playing the fool?!

1262
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:51,429
What is it?

1263
00:46:51,637 --> 00:46:52,762
- What is happening, man?
- There's some issue there!

1264
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:54,637
- Who are you to interfere in my family issues?
- Dude!

1265
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,304
All this isn't required,

1266
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,429
don't come and create ruckus here!

1267
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,262
- Who's he, who's he?
- See this guy dude!

1268
00:46:57,262 --> 00:46:58,095
Look, how he's creating issues.

1269
00:46:58,095 --> 00:46:59,012
What do you want man?

1270
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:00,095
Look dude, he's beating up his wife,

1271
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:00,970
I asked him not to.

1272
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,387
Who are you?

1273
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:03,679
Just stay quiet.

1274
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:04,887
Just move away!

1275
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:05,720
Come here man! Come!

1276
00:47:05,762 --> 00:47:06,637
Stay quite dude!

1277
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:08,845
Just move away!

1278
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,387
Don't raise your hands on women!

1279
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,179
Get lost!

1280
00:47:13,595 --> 00:47:14,554
Did we really need all this?

1281
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,137
What's the difference between you and him?

1282
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:18,137
How would you interfere with my wife's matter?

1283
00:47:18,804 --> 00:47:19,595
You nutcase!

1284
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:49,679
What?

1285
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:50,804
Will you hit your wife?

1286
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:51,720
No, no...

1287
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,304
Come here madam.

1288
00:47:52,762 --> 00:47:53,845
You think you are a cat?

1289
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:56,804
Hit him, hit him!

1290
00:47:59,054 --> 00:47:59,554
Thrash him!

1291
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,554
I will never forget this help of yours.

1292
00:48:14,012 --> 00:48:15,387
Please forget all this and be happy!

1293
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:16,762
Thanks a lot!

1294
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:17,429
No problem.

1295
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:20,137
Thanks.

1296
00:48:41,637 --> 00:48:42,137
Poo...

1297
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,637
I need to talk to you.

1298
00:49:53,387 --> 00:49:54,054
Hello!

1299
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,720
Are you still asleep?

1300
00:49:57,137 --> 00:49:57,929
Yes aunty.

1301
00:49:58,387 --> 00:50:01,220
Why is your voice so dull?

1302
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:04,137
That! I had a headache and vomited too!

1303
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:05,720
What dear?

1304
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,054
Dizziness

1305
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:09,554
and vomiting?

1306
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:10,845
It isn't that aunty,

1307
00:50:11,054 --> 00:50:12,220
I had been to the trip yesterday...

1308
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:13,429
You please keep quiet!

1309
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,137
For men to vomit

1310
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,304
there can be a hundred reasons.

1311
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,679
But for women to vomit,

1312
00:50:19,012 --> 00:50:20,512
the reason is always one!

1313
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:22,137
This is that!

1314
00:50:23,012 --> 00:50:23,970
Fine, fine, my dear!

1315
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:25,429
Do not strain yourself!

1316
00:50:25,512 --> 00:50:26,845
Rest well alright!

1317
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,512
I will call you in the evening.

1318
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:29,679
Bye...

1319
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:38,887
Yes, papa!

1320
00:50:39,012 --> 00:50:39,720
What dear,

1321
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:42,054
I'm still struggling to adjust
becoming a father-in-law,

1322
00:50:42,345 --> 00:50:43,887
You have already made me grandfather?

1323
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:45,054
Who said this to you papa?

1324
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:46,137
Your mother-in-law,

1325
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:48,345
she's broadcasting this all over town!

1326
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,429
Papa! I'd been to a trip yesterday...

1327
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,137
I can make out everything!

1328
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:54,929
Very soon... I will come.

1329
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:05,387
Tell me dude!

1330
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:07,345
Congrats dude,

1331
00:51:07,595 --> 00:51:09,262
you were online all the time,

1332
00:51:09,512 --> 00:51:10,929
when did you go off-line for all this?

1333
00:51:11,387 --> 00:51:12,970
You are great dude!

1334
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:15,179
You win everywhere!

1335
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:16,720
Cut the call, I will talk later.

1336
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:20,679
Actually...

1337
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,012
Isn't my mother very cute?

1338
00:51:22,137 --> 00:51:22,804
Very innocent?

1339
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:24,262
Does your mother have any sense!

1340
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:26,637
God has given two ears!

1341
00:51:26,845 --> 00:51:28,137
To listen well...

1342
00:51:28,304 --> 00:51:29,429
Why has he given only one mouth?

1343
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:30,679
To talk less.

1344
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:34,137
Your mother listens to half
and speaks double!

1345
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:36,345
Get up!

1346
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:39,887
They should not get involved in
our personal affairs!

1347
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:40,762
Clear that!

1348
00:51:42,137 --> 00:51:44,304
I will call and clear it later!

1349
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:45,262
When?

1350
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,345
After your mother broadcasts after this!?

1351
00:51:47,595 --> 00:51:48,054
No...

1352
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:49,387
I will talk to her now!

1353
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:01,679
Yes? Tell me son...

1354
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:04,970
That... Stomach upset made Pooja vomit,

1355
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,845
not to make me a father.

1356
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:12,137
Mother... About that...

1357
00:52:12,304 --> 00:52:13,387
About having children...

1358
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,970
That, my...

1359
00:52:18,262 --> 00:52:21,220
We will decide when we want a child,

1360
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,054
this is our personal matter.

1361
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:25,012
You don't have to interfere

1362
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:27,137
has your wife told you to say this!?

1363
00:52:27,304 --> 00:52:29,304
She's creating a rift between us!

1364
00:52:29,554 --> 00:52:30,762
I knew it my boy...

1365
00:52:30,929 --> 00:52:31,845
That demon...

1366
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:33,845
Had an allergy since the start!

1367
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:38,220
When I met her itself,
I should have messed her!

1368
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,845
Give the phone to that demoness!

1369
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:42,304
I'll talk to you later mother!

1370
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,929
This...

1371
00:52:45,554 --> 00:52:46,887
This is my stature!

1372
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:47,387
What was that!?

1373
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,012
What did your mother say on the call?

1374
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:51,262
Some lady, lady!

1375
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,387
No... She said milk lady!

1376
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,095
One minute...
I'm getting a call from the office.

1377
00:52:57,429 --> 00:52:58,844
Even though your mother talked so much

1378
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:00,720
you can't even stand up for me!

1379
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,429
No use talking to you!

1380
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:09,637
I'm 'Live' after many days...

1381
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,387
Latest saree collections are there!

1382
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,137
Poo...

1383
00:53:13,262 --> 00:53:13,887
Who are you!?

1384
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,095
Why are you repeatedly saying Hi!?

1385
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,595
Can't you mind your own business!?

1386
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:20,970
When I needed it, you did not support!

1387
00:53:21,304 --> 00:53:22,679
Why are you disturbing me
when I am live online?

1388
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:07,887
Do you want a break?

1389
00:54:09,387 --> 00:54:09,720
No.

1390
00:54:09,762 --> 00:54:11,012
In life, all the good moments

1391
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:13,179
pass by so fast...

1392
00:54:14,012 --> 00:54:14,970
But the bad moments

1393
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,054
we pray should get over soon!

1394
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:18,220
Let's finish it.

1395
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,095
Hi Papa...

1396
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:30,179
Why are you looking so dull?

1397
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:33,929
What happened?

1398
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:36,054
I had to take an Ayurvedic medicine

1399
00:54:36,345 --> 00:54:37,387
I won't get it here...

1400
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:38,970
From Bengaluru, can you...

1401
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:39,929
No need dear...

1402
00:54:40,012 --> 00:54:41,179
You should have told me!

1403
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:42,179
I too forgot!

1404
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:43,345
It's okay dear...

1405
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:46,595
After marriage,
I didn't want to trouble you.

1406
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,095
Why these formalities with me?

1407
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,137
I will send!

1408
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:50,804
Okay dear!

1409
00:54:50,845 --> 00:54:51,179
Be careful...

1410
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,804
- Send it with the driver.
- Bye!

1411
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:05,179
Deep, one minute...

1412
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:06,929
There was a call from your house...

1413
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,137
We need to send the documents, it seems.

1414
00:55:09,387 --> 00:55:09,887
I've taken them.

1415
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,262
They said it's urgent.

1416
00:55:12,512 --> 00:55:13,095
I'll send them.

1417
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:16,220
And father's Ayurvedic medicine
should be sent too.

1418
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:18,220
On the way while going...

1419
00:55:18,262 --> 00:55:19,929
They'll bring the medicine to Malleswaram,

1420
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:21,595
if you call the SRS driver

1421
00:55:21,637 --> 00:55:22,387
they'll collect it and go.

1422
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:25,179
Is this why you're now talking to me?

1423
00:55:25,262 --> 00:55:26,554
Leave it, I'll send it.

1424
00:55:27,304 --> 00:55:27,929
I was only joking.

1425
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,304
It's fine, anyway it's my work.

1426
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,095
Poo...

1427
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:33,054
Why do you take everything so seriously?

1428
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:35,887
It's my father's health issue,

1429
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:37,304
it's important.

1430
00:55:37,387 --> 00:55:38,179
Your father is my father-in-law,

1431
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:39,804
send me the number...

1432
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:40,845
I'll send it.

1433
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:46,179
Bye!

1434
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:46,929
Thanks.

1435
00:55:58,804 --> 00:55:59,637
It's urgent.

1436
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:00,304
- Can you send it fast?
- Okay sir.

1437
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:01,345
- Is that so sir?
- Don't forget.

1438
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:01,970
Sure sir.

1439
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:02,679
Okay sir.

1440
00:56:10,137 --> 00:56:11,220
One minute sir, I'm coming...

1441
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:14,470
Hello Giri...

1442
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:15,220
Hello dude!

1443
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:17,054
There's just five minutes for the meeting,

1444
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:18,762
in two minutes, I will reach...

1445
00:56:18,845 --> 00:56:19,262
Where are you?

1446
00:56:19,263 --> 00:56:20,554
First check your eyes...

1447
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:21,512
It's not in five minutes,

1448
00:56:21,554 --> 00:56:22,470
it's in the evening at 5!

1449
00:56:22,762 --> 00:56:24,012
You get your eyes checked

1450
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:25,929
didn't another mail come yesterday?

1451
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:27,220
That the meeting has been advanced.

1452
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,095
I didn't see it...

1453
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:30,929
Leave it dude...

1454
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,054
You're newly married,

1455
00:56:32,095 --> 00:56:32,845
you will be busy.

1456
00:56:33,887 --> 00:56:34,720
Shut up and cut the call!

1457
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:35,845
I'll be there.

1458
00:56:37,637 --> 00:56:38,262
Take these sir.

1459
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:38,970
Thank you.

1460
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:43,887
Do you all know that

1461
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,054
we have clients from

1462
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:45,970
South America,

1463
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:47,012
South Africa...

1464
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,554
And Deepak, you'll head the team.

1465
00:56:48,762 --> 00:56:49,387
Is that fine?

1466
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,512
All the best guys!

1467
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:52,220
Dude,

1468
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,970
since morning he bored us!

1469
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:56,387
What he was talking,
did you understand anything?

1470
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,262
I took tablets to cure the headache!

1471
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:00,762
What!?

1472
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:01,970
Tablets for headache!

1473
00:57:02,804 --> 00:57:03,220
Tablets!

1474
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:05,720
Sorry!

1475
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,720
- I have told him...
- Sir...

1476
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,512
I need to deliver these quickly!

1477
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,345
Quickly means?

1478
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,554
Shall I send it by WhatsApp?

1479
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,762
Sir comedy should make people laugh,

1480
00:57:16,845 --> 00:57:17,470
not burn them!

1481
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:20,220
Give it to the driver, he will deliver it!

1482
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,345
Give him the money too.

1483
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:28,470
Wow! Super!

1484
00:57:28,887 --> 00:57:29,845
I saw YouTube and made it.

1485
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:30,470
It's okay!

1486
00:57:31,637 --> 00:57:32,470
It's super!

1487
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:36,054
Hi Papa.

1488
00:57:36,262 --> 00:57:37,679
Look here,
I've made your favorite dish!

1489
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:40,512
Why are you so dull, Papa?

1490
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:42,304
Did you not take your pill today also?

1491
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:44,512
If not sad, what else!?

1492
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,095
You said you will send the tablets with the driver...

1493
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:47,762
Where is he?

1494
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:48,387
Really?

1495
00:57:49,304 --> 00:57:49,720
Deep...

1496
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:51,012
You delivered the tablets?

1497
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:53,970
I sent them...

1498
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:55,845
Why this doubt?

1499
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:57,179
No, I gave it to the driver!

1500
00:57:58,637 --> 00:58:00,554
Papa, Deep says that he has sent it...

1501
00:58:00,595 --> 00:58:01,345
Where did he send it?

1502
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:03,095
No driver came and gave it!

1503
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,679
I'll call the driver and ask him.

1504
00:58:04,887 --> 00:58:06,429
Enquire and call!

1505
00:58:11,762 --> 00:58:12,470
Hello, tell me madam.

1506
00:58:12,595 --> 00:58:14,137
Did you deliver the tablets to my father?

1507
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,429
What madam,

1508
00:58:15,512 --> 00:58:17,720
I called him so many times,
he didn't pick up only...

1509
00:58:17,804 --> 00:58:19,179
When your husband called,

1510
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,345
I was already in Hassan.

1511
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:21,762
Tablets are so important...

1512
00:58:22,262 --> 00:58:23,762
He lacks seriousness!

1513
00:58:24,345 --> 00:58:25,929
Today however long it takes,
I'll deliver it madam.

1514
00:58:26,137 --> 00:58:28,345
Fine sir, deliver them urgently!

1515
00:58:28,429 --> 00:58:28,637
Thanks.

1516
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:29,137
Fine madam.

1517
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:32,137
Why did you lie?

1518
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,262
Where did I lie? I gave it...

1519
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,220
Lies again!

1520
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:37,220
How irritating!

1521
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:40,429
I gave it last evening!

1522
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:42,845
Evening?

1523
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:44,804
I told you to give it in the morning!

1524
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:48,929
I couldn't give it in the morning,

1525
00:58:49,012 --> 00:58:50,054
so I gave it in the evening.

1526
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:01,387
Mother...

1527
00:59:01,637 --> 00:59:02,179
Son,

1528
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:03,970
we got the license...

1529
00:59:04,595 --> 00:59:06,304
If you had not sent it at the right time

1530
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:08,220
your father would have been in deep trouble.

1531
00:59:09,387 --> 00:59:11,345
Will you ever let your father get in trouble!

1532
00:59:11,512 --> 00:59:12,637
A son should be like you!

1533
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:13,512
Fine mother, I'll call later.

1534
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:17,095
When did you send the documents
to your house?

1535
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:17,887
Yesterday...

1536
00:59:19,345 --> 00:59:20,304
Morning or evening?

1537
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:24,804
Morning only, just listen to me...

1538
00:59:26,137 --> 00:59:27,220
You showed your true colors...

1539
00:59:27,387 --> 00:59:28,179
Don't say true colors and the such things...

1540
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:31,179
Please listen to what I'm saying
with a little patience.

1541
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:32,220
If I'm ready to listen,

1542
00:59:32,304 --> 00:59:33,595
then you'll state one lie after another.

1543
00:59:34,012 --> 00:59:34,637
You are such a liar!

1544
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:36,054
Don't call me a liar!

1545
00:59:36,095 --> 00:59:36,887
I'll get really angry!

1546
00:59:38,304 --> 00:59:40,512
Showing you a mirror makes you very angry,
right?

1547
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:41,804
Poo...

1548
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:43,012
Simply don't make me angry!

1549
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:45,179
If you get angry, will you hit me?

1550
00:59:47,762 --> 00:59:48,845
You will not flinch to hit me!

1551
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:50,345
Speaking to you is such a waste!

1552
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:51,220
If it's a waste, why are you standing here?

1553
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:51,720
Go!

1554
01:00:06,887 --> 01:00:08,470
<i>Oh! My love... Oh! My love...</i>

1555
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:11,220
<i>Is this separation justified?</i>

1556
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:13,554
<i>Akin to a rainbow...</i>

1557
01:00:13,637 --> 01:00:15,887
<i>Will you fade and become an illusion?</i>

1558
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,512
<i>Oh! My love... Oh! My love...</i>

1559
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,262
<i>Why do you come thus!?</i>

1560
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:23,929
<i>After building a nest in my heart,</i>

1561
01:00:24,012 --> 01:00:26,054
<i>Will you fly away!</i>

1562
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:28,929
<i>The initiation was surely existing!</i>

1563
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,345
<i>Everything then was mesmeric!</i>

1564
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,637
<i>Towards the end why</i>

1565
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:32,804
<i>Do you become so lethal!</i>

1566
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,095
<i>Once the glorious subsides!</i>

1567
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:35,429
<i>Peace is hijacked!</i>

1568
01:00:35,512 --> 01:00:37,095
<i>Commotions and bickering is</i>
a daily occurrence!

1569
01:00:38,595 --> 01:00:39,845
<i>Oh! Love Birds...</i>

1570
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,512
<i>Oh! Love Birds...</i>

1571
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:44,845
<i>Oh! Love Birds...</i>

1572
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:47,262
<i>Oh! Love Birds...</i>

1573
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:49,012
<i>Oh! My love... Oh! My love...</i>

1574
01:00:49,804 --> 01:00:51,762
<i>Why do you come thus?</i>

1575
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,345
<i>After building a nest in my heart,</i>

1576
01:00:54,387 --> 01:00:56,470
<i>Will you fly away!</i>

1577
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,095
<i>The dawn of dusk...</i>

1578
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:27,470
<i>Clear breeze...</i>

1579
01:01:28,262 --> 01:01:30,095
<i>The whispers...</i>

1580
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:32,179
<i>Where are they?</i>

1581
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:37,262
<i>The pleasant moments</i>

1582
01:01:38,345 --> 01:01:41,929
<i>Like they no longer remain!</i>

1583
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:47,595
<i>As if the address itself is incorrect...</i>

1584
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,179
<i>And the orphaned message</i>

1585
01:01:50,554 --> 01:01:52,429
<i>Not being delivered!</i>

1586
01:01:53,429 --> 01:01:56,970
<i>The star scattered and fell!</i>

1587
01:01:58,179 --> 01:01:59,679
<i>Oh! My love... Oh! My love...</i>

1588
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,179
<i>Is this separation justified?</i>

1589
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,179
<i>Akin to a rainbow...</i>

1590
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,179
<i>Will you fade and become an illusion?</i>

1591
01:02:08,095 --> 01:02:09,762
<i>Oh! My love... Oh! My love...</i>

1592
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:12,554
<i>Why do you come thus!?</i>

1593
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:15,304
<i>After building a nest in my heart,</i>

1594
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:17,554
<i>Will you fly away!</i>

1595
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,429
When the two of you fought so much

1596
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:30,179
to solve it

1597
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:32,012
did no third person get involved?

1598
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:34,054
They did get involved...

1599
01:02:39,179 --> 01:02:40,137
Son!

1600
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:43,345
You!

1601
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,720
Why are you shell shocked?

1602
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:48,970
Won't you invite us in?

1603
01:02:49,387 --> 01:02:51,179
People get scared when they see
someone without make up...

1604
01:02:51,512 --> 01:02:53,095
But you are with make-up

1605
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:54,470
that has scared him!

1606
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:56,679
Please put a little less powder...

1607
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:58,845
No, you showed up so suddenly...

1608
01:02:59,387 --> 01:03:00,137
I got shocked!

1609
01:03:00,137 --> 01:03:00,429
Come in...

1610
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,345
Bring them!

1611
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:07,929
His mother and her arrogance!

1612
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:09,595
I have to bomb that!

1613
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:11,887
What is this my son?!

1614
01:03:12,387 --> 01:03:13,679
There is no charm in your home

1615
01:03:14,054 --> 01:03:15,387
And none in your face too!

1616
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,470
Where is that daughter-in-law of mine?
She is not to be seen!?

1617
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,179
Father!
Father!

1618
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:21,095
Where are you off to?

1619
01:03:21,804 --> 01:03:22,679
Daughter-in-law...

1620
01:03:22,887 --> 01:03:23,429
I'll call her...

1621
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:24,304
Come this side!

1622
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:27,512
Come, stand here!

1623
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:28,929
Stand!

1624
01:03:32,595 --> 01:03:33,137
Poo...

1625
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,095
My parents have come...
Come and talk to them.

1626
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:36,679
Who?
Your mother, is it?

1627
01:03:40,012 --> 01:03:40,679
Tell her I won't come!

1628
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:42,012
It will be better if you come quietly...

1629
01:03:46,387 --> 01:03:47,679
The house is so nice, right?

1630
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:52,137
Mama, she was sleeping due to a headache...

1631
01:03:53,179 --> 01:03:54,469
I told her about your being here...

1632
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,470
She got up happily and rushed to come...

1633
01:03:56,554 --> 01:03:57,012
But...

1634
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:57,929
I told her to take her time.

1635
01:03:58,845 --> 01:03:59,429
Poor child!

1636
01:03:59,512 --> 01:04:00,554
I'll freshen up and come.

1637
01:04:00,595 --> 01:04:01,387
Go, my son, go.

1638
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,387
Go, get ready.

1639
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:06,804
What a cat!

1640
01:04:07,054 --> 01:04:08,054
Look at how he lies!

1641
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:09,720
He is born to you, right!

1642
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,470
Only to me?!

1643
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:11,887
No, I was also a part of it.

1644
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:23,429
You have come now with the lemon!

1645
01:04:23,845 --> 01:04:25,762
The bus was late...

1646
01:04:25,804 --> 01:04:26,679
They are both inside together!

1647
01:04:27,095 --> 01:04:28,678
Everything will be okay!

1648
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:30,179
Be quiet and come inside.

1649
01:04:30,387 --> 01:04:30,845
Come inside...

1650
01:04:30,929 --> 01:04:31,679
My son...

1651
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,845
Your father-in-law is here,
come outside!

1652
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:35,554
- Brother, welcome!
- Dear... Your father is here...

1653
01:04:35,595 --> 01:04:36,970
Get some water!

1654
01:04:37,095 --> 01:04:38,137
Slowly, slowly!

1655
01:04:39,762 --> 01:04:41,179
Are you out of your senses?

1656
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:42,679
Why so loud?!

1657
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,554
My native place is Savannur!

1658
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:45,720
That's why!

1659
01:04:45,804 --> 01:04:46,554
Slowly, slowly!

1660
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:47,762
Slowly, slowly!

1661
01:04:48,637 --> 01:04:51,179
It's just that I came to the city for a purchase...

1662
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,262
Also wanted to give my daughter a surprise!

1663
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:55,720
Papa?

1664
01:04:56,012 --> 01:04:56,512
Papa!

1665
01:04:57,304 --> 01:04:58,554
You too talk like me!

1666
01:04:58,637 --> 01:04:59,887
That is your disease!

1667
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:00,679
Shall I give you a tablet?

1668
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,429
Hi Papa!

1669
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,262
- What a surprise!
- How are you?

1670
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:04,554
- You didn't even tell me that you are coming!
- Take this!

1671
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,137
This is from Kukke Subramanya temple...

1672
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:06,679
Thank you.

1673
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,720
Look at that girl!

1674
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:10,054
When her father came how she ran out
and started talking!

1675
01:05:10,262 --> 01:05:11,345
But didn't even come to see as well.

1676
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:11,970
How insolent!

1677
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,429
Surprise, it seems surprise!

1678
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,512
Now we have not come here to fight!

1679
01:05:16,262 --> 01:05:17,554
We have come here to sort out the fight.

1680
01:05:17,637 --> 01:05:18,470
How are you papa?

1681
01:05:18,512 --> 01:05:19,179
You just be quiet.

1682
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:21,054
Where is my son-in-law?

1683
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:22,512
Is he inside?

1684
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:23,095
Papa!

1685
01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:24,595
I will call him,

1686
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:25,637
I will go get him.

1687
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:29,720
Deep...

1688
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:33,762
My father has come,

1689
01:05:34,095 --> 01:05:35,470
please come and talk to him once.

1690
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,595
I have taken a vow of silence for today,

1691
01:05:52,137 --> 01:05:54,637
go tell your father.

1692
01:05:55,512 --> 01:05:56,679
Look, this is too much!

1693
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:58,804
I have seen it!
No big deal! Go away!

1694
01:06:00,887 --> 01:06:01,429
Poo...

1695
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:02,679
Your father is here.

1696
01:06:02,804 --> 01:06:03,804
I should go and talk to him...

1697
01:06:04,012 --> 01:06:04,887
Did you have to call me for this?

1698
01:06:05,137 --> 01:06:05,929
Wouldn't I myself have come?

1699
01:06:06,137 --> 01:06:07,137
How come even in the bedroom,

1700
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:08,970
you are standing so far away?

1701
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:14,595
When we are in front of them,
they will stand far from one another!

1702
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:15,679
Excuse me!

1703
01:06:15,929 --> 01:06:17,595
Any problems with each other?

1704
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,637
No problem!
[In unison]

1705
01:06:20,262 --> 01:06:22,054
We are made for each other!
[In unison]

1706
01:06:24,095 --> 01:06:25,095
Close the door.

1707
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:27,345
Do you think they got to know about our matter?

1708
01:06:28,762 --> 01:06:29,554
What do we do now?

1709
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:30,929
What else?

1710
01:06:31,262 --> 01:06:33,220
Till they are here we will be together.

1711
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:36,345
Act like we are there together.

1712
01:06:36,595 --> 01:06:37,554
I have come now,

1713
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:39,387
we shall solve it.

1714
01:06:45,762 --> 01:06:47,845
Don't talk too much,
go and sleep on the floor.

1715
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,262
I am male dear,
so I will sleep up only.

1716
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:57,929
I trust myself,

1717
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,929
if you have trust yourself,
sleep or go away!

1718
01:07:06,595 --> 01:07:08,345
Deep, everyone is at home,

1719
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,595
if they hide and listen.

1720
01:07:10,095 --> 01:07:11,929
Is your family so cheap

1721
01:07:12,387 --> 01:07:14,137
that they will eavesdrop?

1722
01:07:14,304 --> 01:07:16,845
There is no need to ask about your family.

1723
01:07:17,512 --> 01:07:18,554
Moreover your mother is

1724
01:07:18,887 --> 01:07:21,595
not at all a flirt that she will hide and listen!

1725
01:07:24,095 --> 01:07:25,387
Keep quiet, Deep...

1726
01:07:25,929 --> 01:07:26,429
Come dear.

1727
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,637
Careful!!!

1728
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:48,637
Dear...

1729
01:07:48,929 --> 01:07:50,179
Some places are fragile,

1730
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:53,304
if you hit his head like that,
he will die!

1731
01:07:53,387 --> 01:07:53,970
Gentle!

1732
01:07:54,512 --> 01:07:55,387
Gentle, gentle!

1733
01:07:55,429 --> 01:07:56,512
Everything is alright, thank you.

1734
01:07:58,887 --> 01:07:59,470
Bravo!

1735
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:00,137
Bravo!

1736
01:08:04,304 --> 01:08:04,720
They have come.

1737
01:08:04,762 --> 01:08:05,304
They have come!

1738
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:10,095
Deep, will you drop me to boutique and go?

1739
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,179
Sure!

1740
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:12,762
So sweet!

1741
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:15,512
Bye...
[In unison]

1742
01:08:16,887 --> 01:08:18,595
- Bye, bye, bye!
- Bye...

1743
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,887
- Bye dear!
- Super.

1744
01:08:21,554 --> 01:08:23,179
Sir, sir, sir...

1745
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,387
You saved a drowning ship
and made it reach the shores safely.

1746
01:08:26,512 --> 01:08:28,345
Now shall we go back to our city?

1747
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,762
Reaching the shore is not important,

1748
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:35,304
we should see to it that
the ship does not drown again,

1749
01:08:35,595 --> 01:08:36,429
that is important.

1750
01:08:36,554 --> 01:08:37,595
Yes, yes.

1751
01:08:37,887 --> 01:08:38,387
How sir?

1752
01:08:39,387 --> 01:08:41,095
I will go to my place and get a powder,

1753
01:08:41,762 --> 01:08:43,595
we should mix it in milk and give it to them,

1754
01:08:43,762 --> 01:08:45,387
they will not go to work.

1755
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,220
He will work from the house itself.

1756
01:08:47,429 --> 01:08:49,054
Both of them now will become three.

1757
01:08:49,554 --> 01:08:51,179
If they have twins

1758
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,220
then they will become four!

1759
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:53,679
It is their risk, they will only know.

1760
01:08:55,137 --> 01:08:56,512
So you are saying that

1761
01:08:56,637 --> 01:08:58,095
we should see our grandchildren,

1762
01:08:58,179 --> 01:09:00,179
finish their naming ceremony and then go!

1763
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:02,929
One who finishes the work
and goes is not great!

1764
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:06,887
One who sees to it that we don't
return here again is great!

1765
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:10,095
You are the greatest ever!

1766
01:09:10,512 --> 01:09:12,470
He talks very smooth!

1767
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:14,304
No, he is right.

1768
01:09:15,845 --> 01:09:17,345
Once our grandson comes

1769
01:09:17,429 --> 01:09:18,220
only then will we go from here.

1770
01:09:20,179 --> 01:09:20,804
Let it happen.

1771
01:09:21,054 --> 01:09:21,845
The grandchild!

1772
01:09:22,345 --> 01:09:23,429
Even if they are not like us, it is fine!

1773
01:09:23,845 --> 01:09:25,054
Even if it doesn't resemble us, it is fine,

1774
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,387
as long as it does not resemble him,
it is fine!

1775
01:09:29,304 --> 01:09:30,720
Keep quiet.
Oh! God!

1776
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:32,387
What is the meaning of your words?

1777
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:34,345
Joke, it's a joke.

1778
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:35,429
What joke?

1779
01:09:35,512 --> 01:09:38,345
That means my face is so bad, is it?

1780
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:41,220
Bad, no, not bad.

1781
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,095
What then?

1782
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:43,137
What are you saying 'No' for now?

1783
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,637
If you talk, talk about your face,

1784
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,429
talk about your stomach,

1785
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,637
talk about what is below your stomach...

1786
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:49,929
Yours abs are six pack, is it?

1787
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:51,762
See lady...

1788
01:09:52,345 --> 01:09:52,887
See lady...

1789
01:09:53,387 --> 01:09:54,262
What stomach!

1790
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:56,345
- What are you telling?
- Your husband's is big or mine is big!

1791
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:57,054
Mine is big!

1792
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,595
What are you showing my wife man,
to my wife!

1793
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,929
Your hair is yucky!

1794
01:10:01,345 --> 01:10:05,804
If you speak about my hair,
I will cut your tongue!

1795
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:07,095
What tongue man!

1796
01:10:07,179 --> 01:10:09,470
God only has cut everything
and made you a dwarf!

1797
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:11,179
You will show your stomach to my wife is it.

1798
01:10:11,304 --> 01:10:11,887
Your stomach!

1799
01:10:15,054 --> 01:10:15,512
Hello!

1800
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,304
Who man... Who?

1801
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:26,387
Come here son.

1802
01:10:26,595 --> 01:10:27,970
- What father?
- What?

1803
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,970
- Come here...
- Tell...

1804
01:10:29,179 --> 01:10:29,470
What?!

1805
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:30,137
Tell to his father!

1806
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:31,637
Will a dog feel bad when called so?

1807
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:33,804
Will a pig feel bad when called so?

1808
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,095
This bloody b^&%s%^&d

1809
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:35,970
when I called him scrap

1810
01:10:36,054 --> 01:10:37,304
he got vivid!

1811
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:40,262
Son of a bitch.

1812
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,929
Your death is in my hands!

1813
01:10:43,512 --> 01:10:44,845
If you speak another word...

1814
01:10:45,095 --> 01:10:47,720
I am a wrestler! Wrestler!

1815
01:10:48,595 --> 01:10:49,845
Who is a wrestler?

1816
01:10:50,137 --> 01:10:51,095
Pint sized dude!

1817
01:10:51,137 --> 01:10:51,512
Go man.

1818
01:10:51,554 --> 01:10:52,012
Uncle!

1819
01:10:52,054 --> 01:10:52,429
See daughter!

1820
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:53,220
Mind your tongue.

1821
01:10:53,304 --> 01:10:54,262
Whatever it is, he is my father.

1822
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:55,720
Son!

1823
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:56,554
Protecting her father

1824
01:10:56,595 --> 01:10:57,512
see how she is quarrelling.

1825
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,595
Insults to your father is still keeping you silent!

1826
01:10:59,637 --> 01:11:00,429
You also talk son.

1827
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,179
Mother, keep quiet mother.

1828
01:11:01,554 --> 01:11:03,179
Uncle you please go inside,
I will talk.

1829
01:11:03,512 --> 01:11:04,095
What!

1830
01:11:04,387 --> 01:11:05,554
Why should I go in?

1831
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,012
Ask your father to fall at my feet

1832
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,137
and apologize,

1833
01:11:08,262 --> 01:11:09,179
then I will go in.

1834
01:11:09,304 --> 01:11:10,137
My husband?

1835
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,679
I will ask sorry
please uncle, be inside.

1836
01:11:13,345 --> 01:11:14,929
Why should we ask him sorry?

1837
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,429
This is a Mandya and North Karnataka
combination man.

1838
01:11:17,595 --> 01:11:19,637
See... If we have made a mistake
we should apologize,

1839
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,179
if we have not made a mistake
we will not apologize.

1840
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,303
We are from North Karnataka.

1841
01:11:23,304 --> 01:11:24,637
Tell your father to go in.

1842
01:11:24,762 --> 01:11:25,970
Why should my father go in?

1843
01:11:26,054 --> 01:11:28,012
Your father's talking nonsense,
send him out!

1844
01:11:28,179 --> 01:11:28,887
Nonsense!

1845
01:11:29,012 --> 01:11:29,720
What did you say?

1846
01:11:29,762 --> 01:11:31,554
I have not called my husband nonsense till now.

1847
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,512
Who are you to tell this to him?

1848
01:11:34,845 --> 01:11:36,720
Why are you valuing him?

1849
01:11:37,054 --> 01:11:39,470
He is subdued by his wife.

1850
01:11:39,804 --> 01:11:41,054
Why should we value him?

1851
01:11:41,179 --> 01:11:41,762
Go man!

1852
01:11:41,845 --> 01:11:42,595
Uncle please get inside...

1853
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:47,220
Daughter, your husband slapped me.

1854
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:47,845
Deep...

1855
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:48,679
Did you slap me?

1856
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,762
Not your cheeks man,

1857
01:11:50,929 --> 01:11:52,804
if you act more, I will punch you.

1858
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:53,804
Go man, go.

1859
01:11:54,845 --> 01:11:55,595
- You will beat me!
- Yes.

1860
01:11:55,929 --> 01:11:56,804
- You will beat me!
- Yes!

1861
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:57,595
Go man.

1862
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:00,220
My son...

1863
01:12:00,762 --> 01:12:03,095
I was trying to talk and he just slapped me!

1864
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:04,304
Hitting isn't enough!

1865
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:05,512
I will kill you!

1866
01:12:05,929 --> 01:12:10,137
[Incoherent fighting]

1867
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:23,554
However proud a father is

1868
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:27,137
when it comes to his daughter's future...

1869
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:30,345
I washed your feet and gave my daughter to you...

1870
01:12:31,054 --> 01:12:31,970
You know why?

1871
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,679
Because his daughter's life should be fine

1872
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,262
that she should be happy.

1873
01:12:38,137 --> 01:12:40,137
If she is only not happy in this house,

1874
01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:42,720
she shouldn't stay in this house.

1875
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,637
She shouldn't stay in this house.

1876
01:12:46,137 --> 01:12:46,887
Come daughter.

1877
01:12:51,595 --> 01:12:52,137
Poo...

1878
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:10,137
Okay...

1879
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:11,470
Got it.

1880
01:13:13,845 --> 01:13:14,637
If you don't mind...

1881
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:16,262
Can you step out for two minutes?

1882
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:18,012
Okay.

1883
01:13:28,512 --> 01:13:29,637
Deepak, Pooja...

1884
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:30,970
Come.

1885
01:13:34,887 --> 01:13:37,304
Incompatibility, miscommunication,

1886
01:13:37,387 --> 01:13:39,054
lack of love, lack of trust,

1887
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:40,220
difference of opinion,

1888
01:13:40,345 --> 01:13:41,345
this and that...

1889
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:42,887
Your case is too complicated!

1890
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:46,637
Please take it...

1891
01:13:47,137 --> 01:13:47,429
Okay...

1892
01:13:48,429 --> 01:13:48,929
Daughter...

1893
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:49,595
Hello.

1894
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,845
Your father-in-law is ruining my reputation.

1895
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,137
If I catch him, I will hit him with a slipper!

1896
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:57,470
With slippers!

1897
01:13:58,137 --> 01:13:59,304
Who is he going to hit with a slipper?

1898
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:00,429
Your father!

1899
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:02,262
Father-in-law!

1900
01:14:02,762 --> 01:14:03,887
Meet me in person!

1901
01:14:04,012 --> 01:14:05,554
I'll turn this divorce case into a murder case!

1902
01:14:05,637 --> 01:14:06,179
What he's talking!

1903
01:14:07,345 --> 01:14:08,720
Who are you going to murder!?

1904
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:09,595
Who else? Your father!

1905
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:10,887
You are talking about my father!?

1906
01:14:17,137 --> 01:14:17,845
Pooja!

1907
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:18,720
Deepak...

1908
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:19,720
Please...

1909
01:14:27,054 --> 01:14:27,970
Stop it!

1910
01:14:38,387 --> 01:14:39,095
Stop it!

1911
01:14:39,887 --> 01:14:41,595
By chance if you decide to become
a couple again!

1912
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:43,429
I won't allow it!

1913
01:14:44,054 --> 01:14:45,220
I will make sure you get divorced!

1914
01:14:58,706 --> 01:14:59,164
Hello...

1915
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:01,706
- Sorry Maya.
- Maya sorry.

1916
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:02,372
It's okay...

1917
01:15:03,122 --> 01:15:04,247
The past should be left behind,

1918
01:15:05,206 --> 01:15:06,789
future is the only thing under our control.

1919
01:15:07,289 --> 01:15:07,831
So...

1920
01:15:07,997 --> 01:15:08,831
Let's move on.

1921
01:15:09,831 --> 01:15:11,206
All your documents are ready...

1922
01:15:11,581 --> 01:15:12,789
If you come tomorrow and sign it,

1923
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:13,872
we can apply for the divorce.

1924
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:14,372
Okay.

1925
01:15:14,414 --> 01:15:14,622
Okay.

1926
01:15:14,622 --> 01:15:15,497
- Okay Maya, I'll come.
- Okay Maya, I'll come.

1927
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:16,164
- Thanks!
- Okay...

1928
01:15:16,456 --> 01:15:17,122
- See you tomorrow.
- See you...

1929
01:15:24,706 --> 01:15:26,164
- This file... Keep it over there.
- Is it ready madam?

1930
01:15:26,581 --> 01:15:26,997
They are here...

1931
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:27,622
Just two minutes.

1932
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:29,247
- I'll sign it and return it.
- Okay, thanks madam.

1933
01:15:29,414 --> 01:15:29,831
Yes, please sit down.

1934
01:15:30,872 --> 01:15:32,622
For small things,

1935
01:15:32,956 --> 01:15:33,997
I turn this place into my office.

1936
01:15:34,372 --> 01:15:34,914
Giri!

1937
01:15:35,706 --> 01:15:36,164
What are you doing over there?

1938
01:15:36,247 --> 01:15:36,581
Come here!

1939
01:15:36,914 --> 01:15:37,664
Before the divorce

1940
01:15:37,747 --> 01:15:39,122
you two are still husband and wife dude...

1941
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,163
Why should I come between the two of you

1942
01:15:41,164 --> 01:15:42,997
and get hit by slippers and brooms?

1943
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,289
Revenge?

1944
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:45,206
Just a little...

1945
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:47,039
You continue...

1946
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:47,706
Okay!

1947
01:15:48,997 --> 01:15:50,747
Both of your divorce documents are ready...

1948
01:15:50,872 --> 01:15:51,706
Look through it once.

1949
01:15:52,456 --> 01:15:53,497
For 2 - 3 days

1950
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:54,622
I have been studying your case...

1951
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:56,664
There is a serious problem!

1952
01:15:57,331 --> 01:15:57,956
- What is it?
- What is it?

1953
01:15:58,247 --> 01:15:58,872
Both of you

1954
01:15:59,247 --> 01:16:00,164
'Made for each other!'

1955
01:16:00,206 --> 01:16:02,081
that you will be together for life

1956
01:16:02,497 --> 01:16:03,497
all your documents

1957
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:04,206
and all assets

1958
01:16:04,247 --> 01:16:05,497
are in both your names!

1959
01:16:05,914 --> 01:16:07,206
Your Chikmagaluru site

1960
01:16:07,372 --> 01:16:08,206
is in both your names!

1961
01:16:08,372 --> 01:16:09,206
The car is in your name

1962
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,456
but you are paying the EMI.

1963
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:12,997
Accounts, investments, insurance,

1964
01:16:13,372 --> 01:16:14,372
are in both your names!

1965
01:16:14,872 --> 01:16:16,081
To apply for divorce

1966
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:17,081
it will take 90 days.

1967
01:16:17,122 --> 01:16:17,956
Before that

1968
01:16:17,997 --> 01:16:20,206
split your joint assets equally.

1969
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:21,414
Are you joking!

1970
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:23,539
My hard-earned money

1971
01:16:23,831 --> 01:16:24,497
I should give it to her

1972
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:25,414
so that she can romance someone else!?

1973
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:26,497
I want my money!

1974
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:27,872
Him being in my life!

1975
01:16:27,914 --> 01:16:28,872
I want no trace of that!

1976
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:30,247
Let him sell everything!

1977
01:16:30,331 --> 01:16:31,831
I want what is mine, that's enough!

1978
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:32,497
Madam,

1979
01:16:32,539 --> 01:16:33,289
I'm a software engineer

1980
01:16:33,331 --> 01:16:33,997
not a salesman!

1981
01:16:34,372 --> 01:16:36,206
This saree, jacket sales is in her line...

1982
01:16:36,247 --> 01:16:36,831
Let her sell everything!

1983
01:16:36,914 --> 01:16:38,164
Don't talk about my profession...

1984
01:16:38,372 --> 01:16:39,039
It's called a boutique!

1985
01:16:39,664 --> 01:16:40,914
Saree and jacket he says!

1986
01:16:41,206 --> 01:16:41,914
Where will it go?

1987
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,414
Village blood and cheap mentality!

1988
01:16:43,622 --> 01:16:43,956
Pooja...

1989
01:16:44,372 --> 01:16:45,997
She has Queen Elizabeth's blood?

1990
01:16:46,289 --> 01:16:47,956
If a forest officer sees her father

1991
01:16:47,997 --> 01:16:49,164
thinking it's a chimpanzee

1992
01:16:49,206 --> 01:16:50,164
he will take him to the forest!

1993
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:51,456
You don't talk about my father!

1994
01:16:52,414 --> 01:16:52,872
Look...

1995
01:16:52,997 --> 01:16:54,746
If the two of you keep fighting like this,

1996
01:16:54,747 --> 01:16:55,372
it's waste!

1997
01:16:55,706 --> 01:16:56,956
If you want a divorce

1998
01:16:57,456 --> 01:16:58,664
the assets need to be separated.

1999
01:16:59,164 --> 01:17:00,039
You decide!

2000
01:17:00,206 --> 01:17:01,206
You have 90 days time.

2001
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:02,997
Now sign it.

2002
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:10,997
Thank you.

2003
01:17:12,581 --> 01:17:13,581
Thank you.

2004
01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:19,664
What's with you dude!?

2005
01:17:19,872 --> 01:17:20,539
When we go there, you stay here

2006
01:17:20,581 --> 01:17:21,539
and when we come here, you go there.

2007
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:23,247
No, I am playing Kho-Kho by myself.

2008
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:24,289
You keep talking, I'll come.

2009
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:29,164
Please send all the documents with Giri...

2010
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:30,914
I don't want to see your face!

2011
01:17:31,706 --> 01:17:32,706
You think I want to see your face

2012
01:17:32,707 --> 01:17:33,914
and am walking around with your DP!

2013
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:36,081
Fearing that you'll appear in my dreams

2014
01:17:36,122 --> 01:17:37,206
I've stopped sleeping!

2015
01:17:37,872 --> 01:17:38,497
Giri come here!

2016
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:42,872
Dude...

2017
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:43,956
Please sell the car.

2018
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,206
If you want to know anything, ask her.

2019
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:49,039
You go now...

2020
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,331
I'll come tomorrow and collect it.

2021
01:17:50,539 --> 01:17:51,206
Thanks.

2022
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:00,331
I ran around for their wedding,

2023
01:18:00,497 --> 01:18:02,372
Helping them get a divorce is very sad!

2024
01:18:02,539 --> 01:18:05,289
We who adjust to anything life throws at us

2025
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:06,747
when it comes to a wife and husband

2026
01:18:06,872 --> 01:18:08,456
why do we grow such an ego?

2027
01:18:09,122 --> 01:18:11,372
If we see someone drowning from a far...

2028
01:18:11,747 --> 01:18:13,539
It looks like they're playing in the water.

2029
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:14,872
To each their own problems...

2030
01:18:15,331 --> 01:18:16,664
We should respect their decision.

2031
01:18:20,789 --> 01:18:21,581
Hello, tell me uncle!

2032
01:18:21,622 --> 01:18:23,039
It's me, Giri!

2033
01:18:23,622 --> 01:18:23,997
Yes Uncle!

2034
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:26,664
Apparently, you're selling my son's car?

2035
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:28,206
That shorty

2036
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:30,664
seems to have an eye on my son's car...

2037
01:18:31,247 --> 01:18:32,039
Look...

2038
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:33,622
I don't know what you will do

2039
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:36,164
but you have to sell that car in my presence!

2040
01:18:36,206 --> 01:18:36,747
Understand?

2041
01:18:37,122 --> 01:18:38,081
I will come.

2042
01:18:38,456 --> 01:18:39,789
That bugger!

2043
01:18:40,331 --> 01:18:40,914
Okay uncle.

2044
01:18:45,622 --> 01:18:46,039
Hello?

2045
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:46,789
Hello!

2046
01:18:46,997 --> 01:18:47,997
This is me speaking.

2047
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:48,706
Who is me?

2048
01:18:48,956 --> 01:18:50,038
Do you think I recognize your voice

2049
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:50,956
like you're some celebrity!?

2050
01:18:50,997 --> 01:18:51,539
Tell me your name.

2051
01:18:52,789 --> 01:18:54,247
You are Deepak's friend, right?

2052
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,289
You also have an attitude like him!

2053
01:18:57,664 --> 01:18:58,997
Pooja's father!

2054
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:01,039
Hearing that the car is for sale...

2055
01:19:01,081 --> 01:19:02,456
That broker father of his

2056
01:19:02,497 --> 01:19:04,289
will try to steal the money!

2057
01:19:04,664 --> 01:19:06,414
I have some work with him.

2058
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:07,622
I will come there...

2059
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:09,414
The car deal should happen
in front of my eyes!

2060
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:10,081
That's all!

2061
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:11,497
Okay uncle.

2062
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,247
In this case,

2063
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:14,914
half the problems is due to these two only!

2064
01:19:15,622 --> 01:19:17,289
Somehow, we need to
teach these two a lesson!

2065
01:19:17,997 --> 01:19:18,789
For all this...

2066
01:19:18,872 --> 01:19:20,372
That car dealer Syed...

2067
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:21,456
He is perfect!

2068
01:19:23,539 --> 01:19:24,871
He's a dealer by name only...

2069
01:19:24,872 --> 01:19:25,872
A big rowdy!

2070
01:19:26,664 --> 01:19:28,456
Take these two to him,

2071
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:30,539
I'll tell you what to do there.

2072
01:19:30,622 --> 01:19:31,747
Repairing them royally

2073
01:19:32,497 --> 01:19:33,164
he will do that!

2074
01:19:33,289 --> 01:19:34,122
Okay!

2075
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:36,122
What is it dude?

2076
01:19:36,247 --> 01:19:37,831
Brother, that party I told you about.

2077
01:19:40,247 --> 01:19:41,497
I saw your car...

2078
01:19:42,789 --> 01:19:45,081
It's not in a good condition for sale...

2079
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:46,164
It will be a little difficult.

2080
01:19:46,206 --> 01:19:47,122
Brother Syed...

2081
01:19:47,664 --> 01:19:48,872
How many kids do you have?

2082
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:49,497
Nine!

2083
01:19:49,997 --> 01:19:50,831
Didn't it hurt?

2084
01:19:51,747 --> 01:19:53,122
It didn't hurt while conceiving them...

2085
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,456
Now when I'm raising them it does pain!

2086
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:57,164
Sir you look very weak,

2087
01:19:57,497 --> 01:19:59,247
how do you have so many kids?

2088
01:19:59,372 --> 01:20:01,164
That's my personal performance.

2089
01:20:01,247 --> 01:20:02,122
Is that so...

2090
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:05,539
Our vehicle also has
the same kind of performance.

2091
01:20:05,622 --> 01:20:06,914
What do you think?

2092
01:20:07,706 --> 01:20:08,164
Okay.

2093
01:20:08,664 --> 01:20:09,706
How much are you selling it for?

2094
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,081
Ten lakhs.

2095
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:15,497
Before running off to London that Mallya...

2096
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:18,414
I bought a Kingfisher flight for six lakhs.

2097
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:21,372
Am I bonkers to pay ten lakhs for this?

2098
01:20:21,914 --> 01:20:23,581
I have to somehow see to it that he suffers a loss.

2099
01:20:24,997 --> 01:20:25,789
- Hello!
- Syed, it's...

2100
01:20:26,456 --> 01:20:27,997
Bro eats lamb...

2101
01:20:28,664 --> 01:20:30,164
But that dunce...

2102
01:20:30,497 --> 01:20:31,414
He is not!

2103
01:20:32,372 --> 01:20:32,997
That's it...

2104
01:20:34,414 --> 01:20:35,706
Vehicle is my daughter's!

2105
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,914
I'll bring her with me and sign it.

2106
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:40,497
Fix it for only four lakhs.

2107
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:41,247
Intelligent!

2108
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:45,372
Dude, this car is owned by my daughter and me.

2109
01:20:45,414 --> 01:20:46,622
Do you want samosa also?

2110
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:47,664
No, tea is enough.

2111
01:20:48,206 --> 01:20:49,081
Listen to me...

2112
01:20:50,331 --> 01:20:51,331
You are a waste!

2113
01:20:51,497 --> 01:20:51,914
Go! Go!

2114
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:53,664
We have to get RC book.

2115
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:56,914
Insurance card.

2116
01:20:57,622 --> 01:20:59,121
Just because I am wearing a half sleeve shirt...

2117
01:20:59,122 --> 01:21:00,456
You think I'm a village bumpkin!?

2118
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:01,914
I sleep in Frazer town

2119
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:02,872
and wake up in Shivajinagar!

2120
01:21:03,081 --> 01:21:04,539
For all your mafia Dons

2121
01:21:04,914 --> 01:21:06,372
I'm the one who supplies weapons!

2122
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:07,289
I told you right?!

2123
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:08,206
You're a waste!

2124
01:21:08,247 --> 01:21:08,414
Go!

2125
01:21:08,414 --> 01:21:08,706
Go!

2126
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:09,622
Go...

2127
01:21:10,789 --> 01:21:12,497
- Change the color of the vehicle.
- My God!

2128
01:21:12,664 --> 01:21:13,914
His talking!

2129
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:17,664
[Incoherent mumblings]

2130
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:29,872
Customers are there...

2131
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:32,331
I'll give as you say

2132
01:21:32,747 --> 01:21:33,581
10 lakhs...

2133
01:21:34,247 --> 01:21:35,122
Come, I will give it inside.

2134
01:21:35,164 --> 01:21:36,247
Not in front of this animal!

2135
01:21:37,497 --> 01:21:37,914
Come...

2136
01:21:37,956 --> 01:21:39,206
What are you talking?!

2137
01:21:41,081 --> 01:21:41,497
Go!

2138
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:42,456
Four lakhs!?

2139
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:44,956
Bear town guy!

2140
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:46,081
Go away!

2141
01:21:47,081 --> 01:21:48,456
He'll put you into biriyani...
Go!

2142
01:21:49,581 --> 01:21:50,706
If he compromises?!

2143
01:21:51,497 --> 01:21:52,414
Brother Syed!

2144
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:54,289
Fortune is what this is!

2145
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:55,289
Ten lakhs!

2146
01:21:59,039 --> 01:21:59,789
Ten lakhs?

2147
01:22:04,914 --> 01:22:05,414
Enough!

2148
01:22:05,872 --> 01:22:06,664
Enough!

2149
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,914
I'm a village bumpkin,
an illiterate man.

2150
01:22:10,206 --> 01:22:12,289
That car won't even go for two lakhs,

2151
01:22:12,622 --> 01:22:13,872
he told me to say ten lakhs

2152
01:22:13,914 --> 01:22:15,122
and he'd say four lakhs.

2153
01:22:15,289 --> 01:22:16,789
He only taught me to say that!

2154
01:22:16,872 --> 01:22:17,664
That Syed won't know the difference

2155
01:22:17,747 --> 01:22:19,956
between a chicken and a goat.

2156
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:21,164
He said that!

2157
01:22:21,372 --> 01:22:22,289
Like that?

2158
01:22:22,497 --> 01:22:23,289
Yes!

2159
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:24,622
Okay...

2160
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:26,039
Don't tell him any of this.

2161
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,414
Simply go and send him inside.

2162
01:22:28,622 --> 01:22:29,497
Yes sir!

2163
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:40,414
He held my leg...

2164
01:22:41,664 --> 01:22:42,581
And gave me Biryani rice.

2165
01:22:42,622 --> 01:22:43,414
Are you kidding?!

2166
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:45,456
And this?

2167
01:22:47,706 --> 01:22:48,914
After finishing the deal

2168
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:50,872
he gave some betel leaves and nuts.

2169
01:22:52,289 --> 01:22:53,414
I thought it was soup!

2170
01:22:54,664 --> 01:22:55,456
You also go in...

2171
01:22:55,747 --> 01:22:56,997
He'll give you a pumpkin!

2172
01:22:58,414 --> 01:22:59,372
Go in uncle!

2173
01:23:00,081 --> 01:23:01,039
- Go in!
- Go in!

2174
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:03,456
What is this man!

2175
01:23:03,997 --> 01:23:05,331
Serve me biriyani rice,

2176
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:06,372
soup,

2177
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:07,789
betel nuts...

2178
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:08,997
You...

2179
01:23:13,539 --> 01:23:13,997
Uncle?

2180
01:23:14,497 --> 01:23:15,039
Uncle?

2181
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:16,372
Uncle?

2182
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:19,122
Uncle, did it work out?

2183
01:23:20,206 --> 01:23:21,664
He said pumpkin but he gave watermelon!

2184
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:23,247
It worked out fully!

2185
01:23:24,331 --> 01:23:25,122
Give me your hand dude!

2186
01:23:26,706 --> 01:23:27,456
Uncle slowly...

2187
01:23:28,956 --> 01:23:30,331
I thought he'll give biriyani rice,

2188
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:32,247
but he only gave soup!

2189
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:35,789
Then father-in-law wants to
sell the property too

2190
01:23:35,831 --> 01:23:37,122
why don't you stand and sell it?

2191
01:23:37,664 --> 01:23:40,372
For this only my face broke...

2192
01:23:40,664 --> 01:23:43,872
For that my whole body will break!

2193
01:23:44,622 --> 01:23:45,289
Go!

2194
01:23:45,539 --> 01:23:47,414
I won't come to this town itself!

2195
01:23:49,706 --> 01:23:51,289
It worked out the way I said, right!

2196
01:23:51,372 --> 01:23:51,956
Yes!

2197
01:23:52,372 --> 01:23:53,539
You know next time what we should do?

2198
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:54,164
For his mother also,

2199
01:23:54,206 --> 01:23:54,914
like this...

2200
01:23:55,539 --> 01:23:56,456
They came, they came...

2201
01:23:57,372 --> 01:23:58,039
Hi dude!

2202
01:23:58,372 --> 01:23:59,122
Hello!

2203
01:23:59,372 --> 01:23:59,997
- Maya madam...
- Hi Giri...

2204
01:24:00,122 --> 01:24:00,622
Yes!

2205
01:24:00,664 --> 01:24:01,831
We need another help from you...

2206
01:24:01,872 --> 01:24:02,331
What is it?

2207
01:24:02,581 --> 01:24:03,414
Actually...

2208
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:05,081
Two major properties are in our names

2209
01:24:05,414 --> 01:24:07,664
so if you only sold it...

2210
01:24:07,914 --> 01:24:09,539
Am I your lawyer or your broker?

2211
01:24:09,622 --> 01:24:11,164
Maya, can you please do it for us?

2212
01:24:11,289 --> 01:24:12,747
Because if our families get involved

2213
01:24:12,789 --> 01:24:14,039
there will be many complications.

2214
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:16,664
Because you are asking so much,

2215
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:17,331
I'll do it.

2216
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:19,289
Let's start with your major properties,

2217
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:20,664
your Chikmagaluru hill property,

2218
01:24:20,872 --> 01:24:22,081
let's sell that first.

2219
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:24,206
I know a lot of people in Chikmagaluru...

2220
01:24:24,372 --> 01:24:25,581
Shall we go this weekend to sell?

2221
01:24:25,831 --> 01:24:26,497
Super!

2222
01:24:26,747 --> 01:24:27,289
Shall we go on bikes?

2223
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:27,747
Yes, yes!

2224
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:28,664
It will be like a road trip!

2225
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:29,331
Sure!

2226
01:24:29,372 --> 01:24:29,747
Super dude!

2227
01:24:29,789 --> 01:24:30,206
Why not!

2228
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:30,956
You?

2229
01:24:31,122 --> 01:24:31,414
No, no...

2230
01:24:31,664 --> 01:24:32,456
I will come by car.

2231
01:24:33,289 --> 01:24:33,956
See you guys.

2232
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:35,581
Why?

2233
01:24:36,081 --> 01:24:37,414
When she goes on bike

2234
01:24:37,497 --> 01:24:38,581
she gets sweaty...

2235
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:45,872
Hi!

2236
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:46,372
Hi!

2237
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:47,331
Good morning!

2238
01:24:47,414 --> 01:24:47,747
Take this!

2239
01:24:47,789 --> 01:24:48,372
Good morning!

2240
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:51,706
Are you ready?

2241
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:52,622
Come!

2242
01:24:52,914 --> 01:24:53,414
Let's go!

2243
01:24:55,664 --> 01:24:56,206
Let's eat here and go!

2244
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:56,956
Okay dude.

2245
01:25:08,372 --> 01:25:09,789
Was the sweet not good?

2246
01:25:09,914 --> 01:25:10,664
It was super!

2247
01:25:10,914 --> 01:25:11,831
Sir anything else?

2248
01:25:12,789 --> 01:25:13,497
One button idli.

2249
01:25:13,664 --> 01:25:13,956
Okay sir.

2250
01:25:13,956 --> 01:25:14,581
Dad is calling...

2251
01:25:15,081 --> 01:25:16,081
I'm getting a phone call...

2252
01:25:16,206 --> 01:25:16,872
I'll just be back.

2253
01:25:17,372 --> 01:25:18,539
I've ordered button idli!

2254
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:20,164
I can't have more...

2255
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:20,872
I'm done.

2256
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:21,747
I'll just be back.

2257
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:22,581
Dude...

2258
01:25:22,747 --> 01:25:23,206
Smoke?

2259
01:25:23,372 --> 01:25:23,956
Yes father...

2260
01:25:24,164 --> 01:25:24,789
I ate breakfast.

2261
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:25,331
I'll take it...

2262
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:27,956
Here...

2263
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:29,372
This hotel.

2264
01:25:40,789 --> 01:25:41,372
Hello madam!

2265
01:25:42,914 --> 01:25:43,747
Madam order please...

2266
01:25:44,289 --> 01:25:44,831
Two minutes.

2267
01:25:44,956 --> 01:25:45,372
Okay madam.

2268
01:25:47,914 --> 01:25:48,747
Do you want anything else sir?

2269
01:25:49,997 --> 01:25:50,831
Get her a masala dosa.

2270
01:25:52,956 --> 01:25:54,247
I asked if you want anything

2271
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:55,539
not what I should serve to others!

2272
01:25:56,581 --> 01:25:57,372
I'm her husband!

2273
01:25:58,997 --> 01:25:59,914
Trouble!

2274
01:26:00,414 --> 01:26:01,206
Look now sir,

2275
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:02,622
how I'll patch everything!

2276
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:05,581
He will patch us up, he says!

2277
01:26:05,997 --> 01:26:06,497
Do it!

2278
01:26:07,414 --> 01:26:08,081
For me, a masala...

2279
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:08,997
Madam your masala dosa!

2280
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:11,039
I didn't even order?

2281
01:26:11,206 --> 01:26:12,831
For someone who understands your mind

2282
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:14,081
doesn't need words madam!

2283
01:26:14,664 --> 01:26:15,747
What are you talking about!?

2284
01:26:15,956 --> 01:26:17,914
Madam your husband ordered it!

2285
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:19,331
Which husband!?

2286
01:26:19,581 --> 01:26:20,414
He's there...

2287
01:26:24,164 --> 01:26:24,997
Please come here!

2288
01:26:25,997 --> 01:26:28,206
She made the order out of order...

2289
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:29,706
Madam, my bill!

2290
01:26:30,122 --> 01:26:30,872
Let the bill be there

2291
01:26:31,122 --> 01:26:31,831
go and tell him...

2292
01:26:32,622 --> 01:26:33,289
If he shows concern like this

2293
01:26:33,372 --> 01:26:34,372
it will go like this in the dustbin.

2294
01:26:34,414 --> 01:26:34,997
Okay madam.

2295
01:26:36,289 --> 01:26:38,456
Sir, madam told that...

2296
01:26:38,747 --> 01:26:39,747
Tell her...

2297
01:26:40,206 --> 01:26:41,372
That throwing the masala dosa in the dustbin

2298
01:26:41,414 --> 01:26:42,331
it is of no use.

2299
01:26:42,372 --> 01:26:43,831
Her head is only a big dustbin,

2300
01:26:44,331 --> 01:26:45,872
first tell her to clear the mess in there.

2301
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:46,956
Go tell her...

2302
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:51,581
Madam, that...

2303
01:26:51,622 --> 01:26:52,372
If someone marries someone like that

2304
01:26:52,456 --> 01:26:53,872
their head will turn into a dustbin.

2305
01:26:53,956 --> 01:26:55,039
Not that madam...

2306
01:26:55,081 --> 01:26:55,664
Bill...

2307
01:26:55,956 --> 01:26:57,622
You also stopped here for breakfast?

2308
01:26:57,706 --> 01:26:58,331
Yes!

2309
01:26:58,581 --> 01:26:59,039
Sir,

2310
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:01,081
madam has agreed that her head is a dustbin.

2311
01:27:01,289 --> 01:27:02,872
Now the bill...

2312
01:27:03,581 --> 01:27:04,497
She agreed finally, right?

2313
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:05,706
I'm happy.

2314
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:09,039
Just for that keep a ₹100 tip!

2315
01:27:09,664 --> 01:27:10,456
Thank you sir!

2316
01:27:11,914 --> 01:27:12,789
Are you married?

2317
01:27:12,872 --> 01:27:13,789
No sir!

2318
01:27:13,956 --> 01:27:15,414
My family is looking for a girl.

2319
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:16,789
Anytime now...

2320
01:27:16,914 --> 01:27:17,831
You idiot...

2321
01:27:18,997 --> 01:27:21,331
For a monkey to become a man

2322
01:27:21,456 --> 01:27:22,956
it took centuries,

2323
01:27:23,122 --> 01:27:25,456
but for a man to become a monkey...

2324
01:27:25,581 --> 01:27:26,706
One marriage is enough.

2325
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:28,872
It's my duty to tell you and I have!

2326
01:27:29,414 --> 01:27:30,539
If you don't listen, it's your fault,

2327
01:27:30,581 --> 01:27:31,289
suffer!

2328
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:31,956
See you!

2329
01:27:36,081 --> 01:27:37,788
I've spoken to them about everything...

2330
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:38,664
You don't worry.

2331
01:27:39,081 --> 01:27:39,581
Okay!

2332
01:27:39,747 --> 01:27:40,831
Let's meet at the location.

2333
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:41,206
Okay!

2334
01:27:41,206 --> 01:27:41,831
- Okay bye!
- Bye!

2335
01:27:41,914 --> 01:27:43,872
[Incoherent chattering]

2336
01:27:44,414 --> 01:27:45,164
We shall enjoy!

2337
01:27:45,331 --> 01:27:46,706
Let's take it, don't worry!

2338
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:49,997
Idiots!

2339
01:27:50,497 --> 01:27:51,581
You shouldn't smoke in public places

2340
01:27:51,622 --> 01:27:52,289
don't you know that!

2341
01:27:52,372 --> 01:27:52,914
What did you say!?

2342
01:27:52,956 --> 01:27:53,997
I'll inhale what I want

2343
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:54,956
or be consumed by flames,

2344
01:27:55,081 --> 01:27:55,956
why do you care!

2345
01:27:56,081 --> 01:27:57,164
Don't mess with us!

2346
01:27:57,206 --> 01:27:57,956
Keep going!

2347
01:27:58,331 --> 01:27:59,206
No dude...

2348
01:27:59,372 --> 01:28:00,289
Just because I'm alone

2349
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:01,914
you'll talk however you want!

2350
01:28:02,039 --> 01:28:03,372
I've come with my friends!

2351
01:28:03,456 --> 01:28:03,914
Hey Giri!

2352
01:28:03,956 --> 01:28:04,414
What?

2353
01:28:04,414 --> 01:28:04,914
Come here!

2354
01:28:05,414 --> 01:28:06,664
Who's Giri!?

2355
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:07,997
Come dear!

2356
01:28:08,081 --> 01:28:08,581
Come!

2357
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:09,206
Come!

2358
01:28:09,206 --> 01:28:09,789
Giri...

2359
01:28:10,872 --> 01:28:12,289
Put your hand in a snake pit

2360
01:28:12,539 --> 01:28:14,122
but don't interfere with matters about a girl!

2361
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,164
Heads will roll!

2362
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:15,997
Dude...

2363
01:28:16,497 --> 01:28:18,456
My father, in my birth certificate...

2364
01:28:18,706 --> 01:28:20,081
Marked me as a man!

2365
01:28:20,289 --> 01:28:20,831
Today...

2366
01:28:20,872 --> 01:28:21,372
I'll prove it!

2367
01:28:21,456 --> 01:28:21,872
Don't dude...

2368
01:28:21,956 --> 01:28:22,956
You'll have it!

2369
01:28:26,622 --> 01:28:28,414
If you just go quietly, it is fine!

2370
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:29,581
Or else...

2371
01:28:29,956 --> 01:28:32,581
If Brahma has written your date of birth,

2372
01:28:32,747 --> 01:28:34,956
then I'll have to write your date of death!

2373
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:36,164
Who is this guy dude?

2374
01:28:36,247 --> 01:28:37,247
Such a big build up?

2375
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:38,206
Give him one!

2376
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:41,914
I told you but you didn't listen.

2377
01:28:41,956 --> 01:28:42,789
Dude!

2378
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:44,039
Now what?

2379
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:48,081
My husband is here...

2380
01:28:48,539 --> 01:28:49,414
Husband!?
Is it him?

2381
01:28:50,372 --> 01:28:51,664
If he comes then you'll know!

2382
01:28:51,706 --> 01:28:52,664
Are you the husband?

2383
01:28:52,956 --> 01:28:53,664
Boss...

2384
01:28:53,914 --> 01:28:55,081
Following Clean Bharat...

2385
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:56,581
She put me in the dustbin.

2386
01:28:57,539 --> 01:28:58,581
She and I are far apart...

2387
01:29:00,664 --> 01:29:01,914
Your husband left!

2388
01:29:06,956 --> 01:29:07,872
Slap her!

2389
01:29:27,789 --> 01:29:29,331
You said you had nothing to do with her!?

2390
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:30,539
Why did you come now!?

2391
01:29:30,706 --> 01:29:31,414
I was going...

2392
01:29:32,914 --> 01:29:33,956
Not only doing something wrong

2393
01:29:34,456 --> 01:29:36,664
but seeing wrong being done
quietly is wrong too!

2394
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:39,372
I remember my mother told me...

2395
01:29:40,331 --> 01:29:40,956
That's why I came.

2396
01:29:51,456 --> 01:29:53,039
You know how to fight?

2397
01:29:53,164 --> 01:29:53,747
So do I!

2398
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:02,206
Girls should speak their minds

2399
01:31:02,622 --> 01:31:03,914
but they should see the situation

2400
01:31:03,956 --> 01:31:04,664
and then speak...

2401
01:31:04,997 --> 01:31:07,081
I won't always be around to save you.

2402
01:31:07,664 --> 01:31:07,997
Bye.

2403
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:10,581
Come!

2404
01:31:11,539 --> 01:31:12,664
We'll go... Okay?

2405
01:31:13,289 --> 01:31:14,081
Come carefully.

2406
01:31:51,747 --> 01:31:52,289
Brother,

2407
01:31:52,789 --> 01:31:54,164
let me find out...

2408
01:31:54,206 --> 01:31:54,747
Please wait.

2409
01:31:57,331 --> 01:31:59,038
He initially agreed for a crore...

2410
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:00,081
But now he's asking for 60 lakhs.

2411
01:32:00,664 --> 01:32:01,289
Mostly...

2412
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:03,456
They have found out about your divorce.

2413
01:32:04,622 --> 01:32:06,581
They are misusing our urgency!

2414
01:32:06,997 --> 01:32:08,039
I'll talk to him, come!

2415
01:32:11,872 --> 01:32:12,539
Look sir...

2416
01:32:13,164 --> 01:32:14,289
Saying one price on the phone

2417
01:32:14,414 --> 01:32:15,331
and calling us to meet here

2418
01:32:15,372 --> 01:32:16,539
and saying another price is wrong.

2419
01:32:16,872 --> 01:32:18,081
If you don't like it, tell me...

2420
01:32:18,289 --> 01:32:19,914
I have another ten people
willing to buy it.

2421
01:32:20,414 --> 01:32:21,914
I've got everything ready
and I've come here.

2422
01:32:22,247 --> 01:32:23,914
If you don't take it, there's no problem.

2423
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:27,289
Leaving that, heeding gossip
that they will divorce

2424
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:29,456
don't think that we'll sell for your rate.

2425
01:32:32,289 --> 01:32:34,081
Look... They're happy together!

2426
01:32:34,914 --> 01:32:35,622
Okay, leave it madam...

2427
01:32:35,747 --> 01:32:36,914
We'll pay a crore and buy it.

2428
01:32:37,122 --> 01:32:38,747
Today only we'll register it, come!

2429
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:39,872
Go ahead!

2430
01:32:40,581 --> 01:32:41,081
What sir!?

2431
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:42,414
When we boys asked, you said no.

2432
01:32:42,497 --> 01:32:43,372
Deepak...
Pooja.

2433
01:32:45,622 --> 01:32:46,372
Success!

2434
01:32:46,581 --> 01:32:47,622
The deal is done for a crore!

2435
01:32:48,206 --> 01:32:48,539
Super.

2436
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:49,331
Did you see...

2437
01:32:49,789 --> 01:32:51,872
If the two of you are separate,
the price is less.

2438
01:32:52,539 --> 01:32:53,414
If you are together,

2439
01:32:54,081 --> 01:32:54,914
you are priceless!

2440
01:33:12,914 --> 01:33:14,956
<i>Without reaching the goal</i>

2441
01:33:15,456 --> 01:33:16,956
<i>In the journey!</i>

2442
01:33:19,706 --> 01:33:21,539
<i>You joined me...</i>

2443
01:33:22,247 --> 01:33:24,289
<i>Why so?</i>

2444
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:29,622
<i>Did it all end</i>

2445
01:33:30,414 --> 01:33:32,747
<i>All the dreams!</i>

2446
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:36,789
<i>What's left at the end</i>

2447
01:33:37,247 --> 01:33:39,164
<i>Is just pain!</i>

2448
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:42,164
<i>Without reaching the goal</i>

2449
01:33:43,289 --> 01:33:44,956
<i>In the journey!</i>

2450
01:33:47,164 --> 01:33:48,956
<i>You joined me...</i>

2451
01:33:49,664 --> 01:33:51,664
<i>Why so?</i>

2452
01:34:14,414 --> 01:34:16,539
<i>What has been shaken and scattered</i>

2453
01:34:16,622 --> 01:34:20,164
<i>That love cannot shine again!</i>

2454
01:34:21,289 --> 01:34:23,747
<i>Without warning</i>

2455
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:27,039
<i>It will leave in a moment.</i>

2456
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:30,581
<i>In the heart of ocean,</i>

2457
01:34:30,622 --> 01:34:33,539
<i>Will the waves not rise?</i>

2458
01:34:35,122 --> 01:34:37,581
<i>The fond memories of the past</i>

2459
01:34:38,206 --> 01:34:40,872
<i>Will it come to stop you?</i>

2460
01:34:41,997 --> 01:34:44,914
<i>The name engraved on sand</i>

2461
01:34:45,414 --> 01:34:47,747
<i>Can be erased.</i>

2462
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:51,206
<i>But the name etched on the heart,</i>

2463
01:34:52,289 --> 01:34:54,747
<i>Can that be erased?</i>

2464
01:34:56,164 --> 01:35:00,497
<i>Again, drops of rain are falling...</i>

2465
01:35:01,206 --> 01:35:06,081
<i>The wish to get drenched in the rain?</i>

2466
01:35:06,497 --> 01:35:08,706
<i>Can I arrest that?</i>

2467
01:35:09,414 --> 01:35:11,622
<i>Without reaching the goal</i>
- Every thing has been divided properly...

2468
01:35:11,914 --> 01:35:13,706
<i>- In the journey!</i>
- If you come to the court tomorrow

2469
01:35:13,747 --> 01:35:15,331
We can move the divorce petition.

2470
01:35:15,414 --> 01:35:15,914
We will come.

2471
01:35:15,956 --> 01:35:16,206
Yeah!

2472
01:35:16,207 --> 01:35:18,206
<i>You joined me</i>

2473
01:35:18,831 --> 01:35:20,414
<i>Why so?</i>

2474
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,539
For two weeks compulsory use this!

2475
01:35:50,581 --> 01:35:51,081
Hello!

2476
01:35:51,414 --> 01:35:51,956
Maya madam,

2477
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:52,831
both of us have come.

2478
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:53,706
Sorry Deepak,

2479
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,539
I am a little tied up in another case...

2480
01:35:55,706 --> 01:35:57,039
That day, for the signature

2481
01:35:57,164 --> 01:35:58,372
you were near a table, right?

2482
01:35:58,414 --> 01:35:58,747
Yes, I know.

2483
01:35:58,789 --> 01:35:59,664
Please come there.

2484
01:36:00,581 --> 01:36:01,664
- There's a document ready...
- Madam, madam...

2485
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:03,039
- You should have asked me. I would have...
- Keep quiet!

2486
01:36:03,706 --> 01:36:05,664
I have kept it all ready.

2487
01:36:05,831 --> 01:36:07,664
You go through the documents.

2488
01:36:08,164 --> 01:36:09,122
Tell them my name,

2489
01:36:09,289 --> 01:36:09,747
get it signed,

2490
01:36:09,789 --> 01:36:10,831
notarize it and come.

2491
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:11,581
Okay?

2492
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:12,622
Alright madam.

2493
01:36:12,872 --> 01:36:13,331
Okay.

2494
01:36:13,664 --> 01:36:14,664
I'm trying something alright!

2495
01:36:14,664 --> 01:36:15,081
Sorry madam.

2496
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:15,872
Just come.

2497
01:36:24,331 --> 01:36:25,039
What happened to your leg?

2498
01:36:26,872 --> 01:36:28,122
When you stepped into my life...

2499
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:28,997
Compared to the pain,

2500
01:36:29,747 --> 01:36:30,706
this isn't bigger than that!

2501
01:36:31,164 --> 01:36:32,081
Do what you have come to do!

2502
01:36:33,164 --> 01:36:33,956
Whatever happened

2503
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:34,789
has happened correctly!

2504
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:35,164
Come!

2505
01:36:40,581 --> 01:36:42,039
Sir, Maya madam had told us...

2506
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:43,081
Yes, it's ready!

2507
01:36:44,164 --> 01:36:45,039
Sign here...

2508
01:36:50,039 --> 01:36:51,539
Are you the one's getting a divorce?

2509
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:53,581
Nice couple...

2510
01:36:53,997 --> 01:36:54,914
I can't believe it!

2511
01:36:54,956 --> 01:36:55,622
You can't believe it.

2512
01:36:56,206 --> 01:36:57,914
A tiger and a goat if put together in
a photo frame

2513
01:36:57,956 --> 01:36:58,539
they will look good.

2514
01:36:58,706 --> 01:36:59,539
Only if you put them together in a cage,

2515
01:36:59,581 --> 01:37:00,289
will you know the reality...

2516
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:02,122
For everything you have to
say something smart!?

2517
01:37:02,164 --> 01:37:03,372
That doesn't keep you quiet either?

2518
01:37:03,997 --> 01:37:05,331
Am I to blame for everything then?

2519
01:37:05,456 --> 01:37:06,372
You are perfect?

2520
01:37:06,747 --> 01:37:07,914
Think and you'll realize!

2521
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:08,789
However much I think

2522
01:37:08,831 --> 01:37:09,206
it's the same...

2523
01:37:09,247 --> 01:37:10,122
You started it!

2524
01:37:10,289 --> 01:37:11,372
When I gave a chair as a gift...

2525
01:37:11,414 --> 01:37:12,414
You couldn't see the love there

2526
01:37:12,456 --> 01:37:13,081
you only saw the colour!

2527
01:37:13,581 --> 01:37:14,664
If you gift me what I like...

2528
01:37:14,706 --> 01:37:15,789
That is called love!

2529
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:17,539
If I have to accept what is given by you

2530
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:18,247
then it's by force!

2531
01:37:18,706 --> 01:37:19,830
Simply between you and me

2532
01:37:19,831 --> 01:37:20,956
didn't your mother interfere?

2533
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,039
After speaking foul about me,

2534
01:37:23,206 --> 01:37:24,414
don't they have any sense?

2535
01:37:24,706 --> 01:37:25,872
I have already explained it to you.

2536
01:37:26,331 --> 01:37:26,831
Look,

2537
01:37:26,872 --> 01:37:27,747
my mother is like that only...

2538
01:37:27,872 --> 01:37:28,831
Either you should have adjusted to it

2539
01:37:28,914 --> 01:37:29,789
or accepted it.

2540
01:37:29,872 --> 01:37:31,539
Even in war there is a break...

2541
01:37:31,997 --> 01:37:32,747
Look at them!

2542
01:37:32,748 --> 01:37:33,789
Non-stop!

2543
01:37:34,206 --> 01:37:35,497
Trying anything is a waste!

2544
01:37:35,831 --> 01:37:36,289
Come!

2545
01:37:37,497 --> 01:37:38,372
I'm telling what's there only...

2546
01:37:38,414 --> 01:37:39,663
Only people with brains will understand!

2547
01:37:39,664 --> 01:37:40,956
You have brains and I don't?

2548
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:41,747
Yes, I do have!

2549
01:37:41,914 --> 01:37:43,956
Don't you have the sense of where you are!

2550
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:44,789
It's the court,

2551
01:37:44,914 --> 01:37:45,706
not your house!

2552
01:37:46,414 --> 01:37:47,289
Your case is next...

2553
01:37:47,956 --> 01:37:48,539
Come!

2554
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:53,164
- Case number MC-852/20-21.
- Madam, ours only!

2555
01:37:56,706 --> 01:37:57,372
Stand here...

2556
01:37:57,831 --> 01:38:00,664
Have you both applied for divorce
by mutual consent?

2557
01:38:01,122 --> 01:38:03,581
Without being pressurized by
anything or anyone...

2558
01:38:04,081 --> 01:38:06,164
Have you decided to take
divorce on your own?

2559
01:38:06,622 --> 01:38:07,539
It's not out of wish

2560
01:38:08,164 --> 01:38:08,872
but when the other party wants it

2561
01:38:08,872 --> 01:38:09,539
I have to give it!

2562
01:38:10,456 --> 01:38:11,706
It's all on me?

2563
01:38:12,122 --> 01:38:13,206
But you won't accept your fault!

2564
01:38:14,497 --> 01:38:15,706
- Both of you stop it!
- It's only when we err that we accept!

2565
01:38:15,747 --> 01:38:16,164
This is a court...

2566
01:38:16,247 --> 01:38:17,414
- To accept one has to have guts, right?
- The judge is watching!

2567
01:38:17,456 --> 01:38:18,289
Don't talk about guts...

2568
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:18,914
- Look...
- Keep quiet...

2569
01:38:19,581 --> 01:38:20,539
This isn't a market place!

2570
01:38:21,081 --> 01:38:22,539
Keep your fights outside!

2571
01:38:23,206 --> 01:38:24,872
Respect the court first!

2572
01:38:25,706 --> 01:38:27,122
You look like educated people...

2573
01:38:27,706 --> 01:38:28,456
Behave yourself!

2574
01:38:29,539 --> 01:38:30,331
Tell me in one word...

2575
01:38:30,914 --> 01:38:32,372
Do you want a divorce or not?

2576
01:38:33,706 --> 01:38:35,581
If both of you want to discuss
and tell me, do so!

2577
01:38:35,914 --> 01:38:37,206
I will give time for that too!

2578
01:38:38,706 --> 01:38:40,664
He can't understand anything sir...

2579
01:38:41,206 --> 01:38:41,956
Please give a divorce.

2580
01:38:42,706 --> 01:38:44,289
I can't understand her either sir...

2581
01:38:44,997 --> 01:38:45,747
Please give a divorce.

2582
01:38:47,914 --> 01:38:50,081
Both parties have agreed to
the mediation of the court.

2583
01:38:50,831 --> 01:38:51,956
The case is decreed!

2584
01:38:56,997 --> 01:38:57,331
Madam

2585
01:38:57,332 --> 01:38:58,914
Both of you have to sign there.

2586
01:39:16,622 --> 01:39:16,914
Next!

2587
01:39:17,164 --> 01:39:18,372
- Wait outside.
- Case number MC 440/18-19...

2588
01:39:18,414 --> 01:39:20,164
- I'll get the divorce copy.
- Quick!

2589
01:39:31,372 --> 01:39:32,622
I'm very upset...

2590
01:39:33,081 --> 01:39:34,372
In every case,

2591
01:39:34,664 --> 01:39:36,289
I use some trick and win,

2592
01:39:36,872 --> 01:39:37,956
but in your case...

2593
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:40,164
Joint assets, road trip...

2594
01:39:40,747 --> 01:39:42,664
Nothing worked out!

2595
01:39:43,456 --> 01:39:45,081
I'm sad that I lost

2596
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:47,706
but I tried my best.

2597
01:39:49,122 --> 01:39:50,039
At least now...

2598
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:52,331
Stop fighting as a couple

2599
01:39:52,997 --> 01:39:54,289
and start a new life...

2600
01:39:55,414 --> 01:39:56,914
You both are more than clients to me.

2601
01:39:59,289 --> 01:40:00,331
I wish you both the best.

2602
01:40:00,789 --> 01:40:01,497
Thanks Maya.

2603
01:40:01,498 --> 01:40:03,497
Thank you.

2604
01:40:04,247 --> 01:40:05,539
I have another case...

2605
01:40:06,122 --> 01:40:06,747
I have to go...

2606
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:51,789
Poo...

2607
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:53,539
Come, I'll drop you home.

2608
01:40:54,164 --> 01:40:55,039
After you have done so much

2609
01:40:55,081 --> 01:40:56,331
if I sit in your car...

2610
01:40:56,664 --> 01:40:57,706
I will feel ashamed of myself.

2611
01:40:57,872 --> 01:40:59,414
It's not to be good in your eyes,

2612
01:40:59,956 --> 01:41:01,331
it's raining
and there are guys here...

2613
01:41:01,372 --> 01:41:01,956
Come, I'll drop you.

2614
01:41:02,039 --> 01:41:03,372
Will you let me be in peace, please?

2615
01:41:04,122 --> 01:41:04,997
Don't be adamant!

2616
01:41:06,414 --> 01:41:08,414
Why are you forcing that girl?

2617
01:41:09,164 --> 01:41:09,747
She's my wife...

2618
01:41:09,914 --> 01:41:11,413
If she's your wife or elder
or younger sister

2619
01:41:11,414 --> 01:41:12,247
it doesn't matter!

2620
01:41:12,497 --> 01:41:14,914
Otherwise,
you will not go out of the court!

2621
01:41:17,164 --> 01:41:18,081
Wait, let's ask her only...

2622
01:41:18,497 --> 01:41:19,956
Do you know this guy?

2623
01:41:49,081 --> 01:41:50,456
<i>Communication...</i>

2624
01:41:51,789 --> 01:41:54,206
<i>After it stopped, I felt lost!</i>

2625
01:41:56,581 --> 01:41:58,164
<i>This silence...</i>

2626
01:41:59,539 --> 01:42:01,997
<i>What does it whisper!?</i>

2627
01:42:04,997 --> 01:42:07,997
<i>While we edged away from each other...</i>

2628
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:12,289
<i>It was as if a bond still held us!</i>

2629
01:42:12,664 --> 01:42:14,622
<i>Utterly orphaned!</i>

2630
01:42:16,747 --> 01:42:18,831
<i>Stated the soul!</i>

2631
01:42:20,539 --> 01:42:27,081
<i>Felt like someone held our shoulder!</i>

2632
01:42:29,664 --> 01:42:31,164
<i>Communication...</i>

2633
01:42:32,414 --> 01:42:34,872
<i>After it stopped, I felt lost!</i>

2634
01:42:37,414 --> 01:42:39,206
<i>This silence...</i>

2635
01:42:40,331 --> 01:42:42,997
<i>What does it whisper!?</i>

2636
01:44:03,247 --> 01:44:03,747
Poo...

2637
01:44:05,414 --> 01:44:07,247
At some point in my life,

2638
01:44:07,497 --> 01:44:08,872
you became my wife.

2639
01:44:09,914 --> 01:44:11,081
Together we even travelled...

2640
01:44:12,289 --> 01:44:13,081
In that journey...

2641
01:44:13,706 --> 01:44:14,789
If I have made any mistake

2642
01:44:15,956 --> 01:44:17,081
or if I have hurt you,

2643
01:44:18,039 --> 01:44:19,039
please forgive me...

2644
01:44:20,289 --> 01:44:21,081
I'm really sorry.

2645
01:44:42,456 --> 01:44:43,122
Deep...

2646
01:44:45,122 --> 01:44:45,872
Dee...

2647
01:45:01,164 --> 01:45:01,664
Poo!

2648
01:45:03,789 --> 01:45:04,289
Poo!

2649
01:45:04,456 --> 01:45:04,914
Poo!

2650
01:45:23,206 --> 01:45:23,831
Yes Deepak...

2651
01:45:23,956 --> 01:45:24,331
Tell me.

2652
01:45:24,414 --> 01:45:24,872
Maya...

2653
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:26,081
Pooja has...

2654
01:45:26,539 --> 01:45:26,956
What!

2655
01:45:28,331 --> 01:45:28,872
What!?

2656
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:30,039
Oh! My God!

2657
01:45:30,747 --> 01:45:32,414
I am near Re-life Hospital...

2658
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:34,997
I know all the doctors there,

2659
01:45:35,331 --> 01:45:36,414
you also come there.

2660
01:45:49,539 --> 01:45:50,622
Stay here sir, wait here.

2661
01:45:52,872 --> 01:45:53,747
Sir you sit there...

2662
01:45:53,872 --> 01:45:54,914
We will come and inform you.

2663
01:46:00,622 --> 01:46:01,164
Come...

2664
01:46:24,997 --> 01:46:25,831
Mr. Deepak...

2665
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:29,164
The doctor is calling you, come in.

2666
01:46:34,289 --> 01:46:35,164
Before this...

2667
01:46:36,081 --> 01:46:37,414
Did anything like this happen?

2668
01:46:40,164 --> 01:46:40,664
I don't know...

2669
01:46:40,747 --> 01:46:41,289
You don't know?

2670
01:46:42,122 --> 01:46:43,789
How long since you are married?

2671
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:45,622
A year...

2672
01:46:45,789 --> 01:46:47,122
You are saying that you don't know?

2673
01:46:48,789 --> 01:46:50,081
What do you think your wife is?

2674
01:46:50,289 --> 01:46:51,122
A housemaid?

2675
01:46:51,747 --> 01:46:53,039
For the person you love
shouldn't you care that much?

2676
01:46:53,122 --> 01:46:53,622
Doctor...

2677
01:46:53,872 --> 01:46:55,039
Please tell me
what has happened to Pooja!

2678
01:46:56,456 --> 01:46:57,456
She is very serious...

2679
01:46:58,081 --> 01:46:59,331
Your wife is suffering from

2680
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:01,872
Cerebral Aneurysm.

2681
01:47:03,414 --> 01:47:03,831
Meaning?

2682
01:47:03,914 --> 01:47:06,872
The main blood vessel connecting to the brain

2683
01:47:06,997 --> 01:47:07,706
has been dilated.

2684
01:47:08,081 --> 01:47:09,164
At any moment...

2685
01:47:09,289 --> 01:47:10,289
It can rupture

2686
01:47:10,539 --> 01:47:12,039
and the patient can collapse!

2687
01:47:14,331 --> 01:47:16,872
It is even more dangerous than cancer.

2688
01:47:17,289 --> 01:47:19,247
Cancer at least has symptoms

2689
01:47:19,372 --> 01:47:21,372
This has no such symptoms.

2690
01:47:24,372 --> 01:47:25,414
Doctor however much it costs...

2691
01:47:26,122 --> 01:47:27,039
Start the treatment now.

2692
01:47:27,747 --> 01:47:28,872
If it was in the early stage,

2693
01:47:29,706 --> 01:47:30,872
we could have done the surgery.

2694
01:47:31,206 --> 01:47:32,081
Now it is too late,

2695
01:47:32,414 --> 01:47:33,622
it is not possible at all.

2696
01:47:35,831 --> 01:47:36,997
If we attempt the surgery now

2697
01:47:37,164 --> 01:47:38,872
the chances of the patient dying are higher!

2698
01:47:40,997 --> 01:47:41,539
Doctor,

2699
01:47:41,831 --> 01:47:43,039
is there no other option?

2700
01:47:43,997 --> 01:47:45,206
No, I am sorry.

2701
01:47:50,164 --> 01:47:50,747
Meaning...

2702
01:47:52,289 --> 01:47:53,539
How much time does she have left?

2703
01:47:53,747 --> 01:47:55,789
Exactly how many days
she has left we cannot tell

2704
01:47:56,122 --> 01:47:58,456
but maximum she has 30 days!

2705
01:48:04,664 --> 01:48:06,956
If anything like this happens again

2706
01:48:07,164 --> 01:48:10,664
Within 6 hours she will be no more!

2707
01:48:11,456 --> 01:48:15,956
<i>Beyond the very skies...</i>

2708
01:48:15,997 --> 01:48:16,414
I mean...

2709
01:48:16,456 --> 01:48:18,206
Even I feel very sad to say like this

2710
01:48:18,581 --> 01:48:20,122
<i>- Let's go...</i>
- I am sorry to say like this.

2711
01:48:20,456 --> 01:48:21,289
<i>Come...</i>

2712
01:48:21,331 --> 01:48:22,164
Till she is alive...

2713
01:48:22,247 --> 01:48:22,956
Look after her well.

2714
01:48:25,914 --> 01:48:27,247
In an hour

2715
01:48:28,081 --> 01:48:29,206
I will discharge her.

2716
01:48:29,331 --> 01:48:30,456
Please be seated over there.

2717
01:48:31,747 --> 01:48:34,414
<i>On this world</i>

2718
01:48:35,122 --> 01:48:37,247

<i>Pain of any sort...</i>

2722
01:48:48,497 --> 01:48:50,997
<i>Should be none...</i>

01:48:51,872 --> 01:48:54,039
<i>Let's reach a new world... Come!</i>

2724
01:48:54,081 --> 01:48:55,497
<i>- Let's reach a new world... Come!</i>
- Madam, all the files are here,

2725
01:48:55,664 --> 01:48:57,706
<i>- Let's reach a new world... Come!</i>
- please take it.

2726
01:48:58,956 --> 01:48:59,872
Everything is okay, right?

2727
01:48:59,997 --> 01:49:01,622
<i>Beyond the very skies...</i>

2728
01:49:01,664 --> 01:49:02,289
Yes... Everything is okay.

2729
01:49:03,122 --> 01:49:05,039
<i>- Beyond the very skies...</i>
- Shall we leave?

2730
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:08,289
<i>Let's go...</i>

01:49:08,664 --> 01:49:10,247
<i>Come...</i>

2732
01:49:54,372 --> 01:49:55,122
One minute.

2733
01:50:27,872 --> 01:50:28,247
Pooja!

2734
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:28,581
Poo?

2735
01:50:30,706 --> 01:50:31,622
What happened?

2736
01:50:33,872 --> 01:50:34,539
Poo!?

2737
01:50:38,706 --> 01:50:40,081
- Open the door, Pooja!
- Poo!

2738
01:50:42,039 --> 01:50:42,622
Pooja!

2739
01:50:43,747 --> 01:50:44,372
Poo!

2740
01:50:44,914 --> 01:50:45,831
Are you okay?

2741
01:50:46,289 --> 01:50:47,164
Poo!

2742
01:50:48,914 --> 01:50:49,497
Yeah...

2743
01:50:50,372 --> 01:50:51,039
Are you okay?

2744
01:50:51,914 --> 01:50:52,372
Yeah...

2745
01:51:13,747 --> 01:51:14,456
What happened?

2746
01:51:17,247 --> 01:51:17,997
Poo...

2747
01:51:18,747 --> 01:51:19,539
Is everything fine?

2748
01:51:22,039 --> 01:51:23,706
I feel like being alone,

2749
01:51:24,622 --> 01:51:25,289
can you...

2750
01:51:25,664 --> 01:51:26,331
Please...

2751
01:51:28,039 --> 01:51:28,622
Sure...

2752
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:30,372
Deepak... Let's leave.

2753
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:52,622
Poo...

2754
01:51:54,247 --> 01:51:55,206
I'm going to ask you something?

2755
01:51:56,581 --> 01:51:57,622
Please don't say no.

2756
01:52:00,831 --> 01:52:01,831
For another 10 days...

2757
01:52:03,206 --> 01:52:04,372
Can I stay with you?

2758
01:52:04,831 --> 01:52:05,539
Please Poo.

2759
01:52:14,997 --> 01:52:15,664
Please...

2760
01:52:16,747 --> 01:52:17,539
I know...

2761
01:52:19,247 --> 01:52:20,622
That you don't like to be with me...

2762
01:52:22,289 --> 01:52:23,247
At least for me!

01:52:43,831 --> 01:52:50,247

till the last second...

2768
01:53:03,372 --> 01:53:04,997

01:53:24,372 --> 01:53:26,539
<i>Pain of any sort...</i>

2774
01:53:27,414 --> 01:53:29,747
<i>Should be none...</i>

2775
01:53:30,789 --> 01:53:36,622
<i>Let's reach a new world... Come!</i>

2776
01:53:38,414 --> 01:53:43,664
<i>Beyond the very skies...</i>

2777
01:53:44,414 --> 01:53:46,581
<i>Let's go...</i>

2778
01:53:46,914 --> 01:53:48,456
<i>Come...</i>

2779
01:54:02,122 --> 01:54:03,289
Sir, whatever is there...

2780
01:54:03,497 --> 01:54:04,956
Make my husband the nominee for that.

2781
01:54:05,164 --> 01:54:05,747
Okay madam.

2782
01:54:05,872 --> 01:54:07,039
Sign this application...

2783
01:54:07,289 --> 01:54:08,414
I will look after the rest.

2784
01:54:08,831 --> 01:54:09,456
Thank you.

2785
01:54:14,706 --> 01:54:15,456
Sorry Uncle...

2786
01:54:15,914 --> 01:54:16,456
It's my mistake.

2787
01:54:16,497 --> 01:54:18,289
These are usual in families...

2788
01:54:18,331 --> 01:54:19,414
Even I can understand!

2789
01:54:19,831 --> 01:54:21,164
You guys have to be happy, that's it!

2790
01:54:21,539 --> 01:54:22,539
Now are you happy dear?

2791
01:54:26,581 --> 01:54:27,331
Come dear...

2792
01:54:28,747 --> 01:54:29,247
Sorry Aunty.

2793
01:54:30,497 --> 01:54:31,206
Don't talk about that...

2794
01:54:31,914 --> 01:54:33,706
It was different when I was a mother.

2795
01:54:33,831 --> 01:54:35,622
It will be different after
the daughter-in-law comes!

2796
01:54:36,706 --> 01:54:38,372
I should have understood that!

2797
01:54:39,289 --> 01:54:40,206
Please forgive me...

2798
01:54:59,789 --> 01:55:04,372
<i>Talking all the comforts of the world</i>

2799
01:55:04,747 --> 01:55:10,956
<i>I will place them at your feet...</i>

2800
01:55:13,164 --> 01:55:15,581
<i>To the moving time...</i>

2801
01:55:16,539 --> 01:55:19,122
<i>Let's put a stop!</i>

2802
01:55:19,831 --> 01:55:24,539
<i>Just hold my hand...</i>

2803
01:55:26,831 --> 01:55:32,581
<i>I will push the swing.</i>

2804
01:55:33,581 --> 01:55:39,081
<i>I will sing a lullaby...</i>

2805
01:55:39,914 --> 01:55:43,664
<i>Sleep like a child...</i>

2806
01:55:43,997 --> 01:55:45,664
<i>Without a care in the world!</i>

2807
01:55:47,456 --> 01:55:48,831
<i>Beyond the very skies...</i>
Even after the divorce order,

2808
01:55:48,956 --> 01:55:50,914
you have assigned the will
in your husband's name...

2809
01:55:51,206 --> 01:55:52,289
<i>Beyond the very skies...</i>
Is that okay?

2810
01:55:53,622 --> 01:55:55,497
<i>Let's go...</i>

2811
01:55:56,122 --> 01:55:57,747
<i>Come...</i>

2812
01:56:00,664 --> 01:56:02,581
<i>On this world</i>

2813
01:56:03,622 --> 01:56:05,622
<i>Everywhere...</i>

2814
01:56:06,914 --> 01:56:08,914
<i>Let's walk across, come!</i>

2815
01:56:09,664 --> 01:56:11,664
<i>Come along!</i>

2816
01:56:15,872 --> 01:56:17,247
When you will see this video

2817
01:56:17,831 --> 01:56:18,747
I won't be there Deep...

2818
01:56:20,122 --> 01:56:21,581
In the time I had left

2819
01:56:21,789 --> 01:56:23,831
Whatever I wished to do for you...

2820
01:56:24,206 --> 01:56:25,372
I have done it all.

2821
01:56:30,039 --> 01:56:31,081
You have to be happy.

2822
01:56:44,997 --> 01:56:45,914
And show!

2823
01:56:49,289 --> 01:56:50,122
I lost...

2824
01:56:53,122 --> 01:56:54,081
I'm very late...

2825
01:56:54,622 --> 01:56:55,831
I have a client meeting.

2826
01:56:55,956 --> 01:56:56,789
So I have to push.

2827
01:56:56,872 --> 01:56:58,289
- Another game...
- We could have played another...

2828
01:56:58,372 --> 01:56:59,289
Even I want to stay

2829
01:56:59,331 --> 01:57:00,706
but I'm getting very late

2830
01:57:00,997 --> 01:57:02,122
I'll call you both...

2831
01:57:02,164 --> 01:57:03,289
You guys continue, okay?

2832
01:57:03,456 --> 01:57:04,122
Okay bye!

2833
01:57:04,206 --> 01:57:05,081
- Bye!
- Bye!

2834
01:57:05,747 --> 01:57:06,706
- See you!
- See you!

2835
01:57:09,164 --> 01:57:09,581
Poo...

2836
01:57:10,956 --> 01:57:12,206
I also haven't gone to the office
since many days.

2837
01:57:13,122 --> 01:57:14,247
I've got a mail that there's a meeting...

2838
01:57:14,831 --> 01:57:15,622
Only two hours...

2839
01:57:15,872 --> 01:57:16,872
I'll go to the office and come.

2840
01:57:17,872 --> 01:57:18,456
Okay.

2841
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:26,206
Deep...

2842
01:57:30,164 --> 01:57:31,914
Can I talk to you for a bit?

2843
01:57:33,206 --> 01:57:33,622
Tell me.

2844
01:57:52,664 --> 01:57:54,497
I really want you be happy.

2845
01:57:57,789 --> 01:57:59,456
Anyway we both are already divorced...

2846
01:58:00,872 --> 01:58:02,122
Will you marry Maya?

2847
01:58:03,747 --> 01:58:04,247
Poo...

2848
01:58:04,747 --> 01:58:05,706
Are you joking?

2849
01:58:07,622 --> 01:58:08,372
I am serious...

2850
01:58:09,372 --> 01:58:09,997
She is good.

2851
01:58:10,331 --> 01:58:10,706
So?

2852
01:58:12,247 --> 01:58:13,622
You both will make a good pair.

2853
01:58:19,372 --> 01:58:20,372
Every day, all day...

2854
01:58:20,414 --> 01:58:21,372
Why did we fight?

2855
01:58:22,331 --> 01:58:24,122
Why did we even think of divorce?

2856
01:58:24,914 --> 01:58:26,206
Now I am happy with you.

2857
01:58:28,122 --> 01:58:29,581
Maya has helped us a lot

2858
01:58:30,289 --> 01:58:31,581
for that I respect her a lot,

2859
01:58:31,914 --> 01:58:32,289
that doesn't mean

2860
01:58:32,331 --> 01:58:33,581
what you think will happen.

2861
01:58:35,872 --> 01:58:36,497
Deep...

2862
01:58:37,497 --> 01:58:39,122
I won't be with you for long.

2863
01:58:41,164 --> 01:58:41,706
I mean...

2864
01:58:41,872 --> 01:58:43,247
To do the fashion designing course

2865
01:58:43,539 --> 01:58:44,456
I'm going to Paris.

2866
01:58:45,122 --> 01:58:46,456
I've talked to father...

2867
01:58:47,081 --> 01:58:48,289
I will settle down there

2868
01:58:48,331 --> 01:58:49,622
I won't come back from there

2869
01:58:50,164 --> 01:58:51,372
so you will be alone...

2870
01:58:51,831 --> 01:58:52,622
Also...

2871
01:58:53,289 --> 01:58:54,622
I think Maya has feelings for you.

2872
01:58:55,039 --> 01:58:55,622
Hey Poo...

2873
01:58:56,164 --> 01:58:56,831
Not like that, Deep...

2874
01:58:56,997 --> 01:58:58,039
If it's too uncomfortable

2875
01:58:58,122 --> 01:58:59,122
I'll talk to Maya.

2876
01:58:59,956 --> 01:59:00,872
Don't talk all this!

2877
01:59:06,956 --> 01:59:07,789
I forgot my keys.

2878
01:59:16,539 --> 01:59:17,122
Sorry...

2879
01:59:17,872 --> 01:59:19,539
I heard what you were talking.

2880
01:59:21,456 --> 01:59:22,081
Pooja...

2881
01:59:22,539 --> 01:59:23,539
You are a good person

2882
01:59:23,872 --> 01:59:25,997
in your tough time as a moral support

2883
01:59:26,039 --> 01:59:27,372
I was here as your friend, but...

2884
01:59:28,247 --> 01:59:30,247
I don't have any feelings for Deepak.

2885
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:31,456
Maya...

2886
01:59:31,497 --> 01:59:32,872
Actually, I was telling Deepak...

2887
01:59:32,914 --> 01:59:33,914
Before you came...

2888
01:59:33,956 --> 01:59:34,622
Please...

2889
01:59:35,956 --> 01:59:37,831
What's on your mind is what
will be spoken Pooja...

2890
01:59:38,622 --> 01:59:38,997
I mean...

2891
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:40,706
I never expected this from you.

2892
01:59:41,747 --> 01:59:43,872
We spent so much time together

2893
01:59:44,289 --> 01:59:46,331
But if you thought like this of me...

2894
01:59:47,497 --> 01:59:50,622
It will be tough for me to
spend time with you both...

2895
01:59:51,122 --> 01:59:52,414
So it's best for me to leave,

2896
01:59:52,789 --> 01:59:54,997
- anyway I wish you both the best!
- No Maya...

2897
01:59:55,497 --> 01:59:55,872
Bye!

2898
01:59:56,164 --> 01:59:56,664
Maya...

2899
01:59:59,456 --> 02:00:00,622
What have you done?

2900
02:00:01,497 --> 02:00:04,081
I didn't expect Maya to overhear us, Deep.

2901
02:00:04,997 --> 02:00:06,289
Now what we do Poo?

2902
02:00:07,122 --> 02:00:09,247
Deep, I did it with good intentions only,
Deep.

2903
02:00:10,081 --> 02:00:10,581
Deep...

2904
02:00:13,914 --> 02:00:15,747
I know that I'm not going to live, Deep!

2905
02:00:19,414 --> 02:00:20,122
What are you saying!?

2906
02:00:26,372 --> 02:00:28,081
I heard what the doctor said...

2907
02:00:44,372 --> 02:00:44,914
Poo?

2908
02:00:46,664 --> 02:00:47,372
Poo?

2909
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:51,247
Poo?

2910
02:00:51,497 --> 02:00:52,039
Poo!

2911
02:00:52,456 --> 02:00:52,997
Poo!

2912
02:01:25,372 --> 02:01:26,247
Emergency!

2913
02:01:41,497 --> 02:01:42,081
Sir!

2914
02:01:42,414 --> 02:01:43,914
The doctor is calling you.

2915
02:01:48,497 --> 02:01:49,039
Doctor.

2916
02:01:54,122 --> 02:01:55,914
Take the tablets without fail ma'am.

2917
02:01:58,289 --> 02:01:58,622
Yes ma'am...

2918
02:01:58,664 --> 02:01:59,206
- Poo...
- Okay!

2919
02:01:59,456 --> 02:02:00,039
Come!

2920
02:02:00,122 --> 02:02:00,747
What happened?

2921
02:02:01,081 --> 02:02:01,497
Come!

2922
02:02:01,581 --> 02:02:02,456
What happened?

2923
02:02:04,081 --> 02:02:04,664
Deep, what happened?

2924
02:02:04,706 --> 02:02:05,914
Why are you going so fast?

2925
02:02:06,456 --> 02:02:07,331
What happened? Tell me!

2926
02:02:07,372 --> 02:02:08,247
Simply sit down! I'll tell you!

2927
02:02:16,081 --> 02:02:16,747
Are you a doctor!?

2928
02:02:16,872 --> 02:02:17,539
Are you a doctor?

2929
02:02:17,622 --> 02:02:18,164
- What happened?
- Why, Deep?

2930
02:02:18,247 --> 02:02:19,247
Why are you holding my collar?

2931
02:02:19,289 --> 02:02:20,164
Just holding your collar!?

2932
02:02:20,331 --> 02:02:21,706
I'll kill you for what you have done!
Deep, stop!

2933
02:02:23,497 --> 02:02:24,331
We went to a different doctor

2934
02:02:24,372 --> 02:02:25,122
do you know what they said?

2935
02:02:26,831 --> 02:02:27,956
I've checked all the reports

2936
02:02:28,497 --> 02:02:29,372
Nothing to worry...

2937
02:02:29,747 --> 02:02:31,372
I'll write a tablet for 30 days.

2938
02:02:31,956 --> 02:02:33,206
If you take that it will be cured.

2939
02:02:33,872 --> 02:02:35,164
Look after her properly.

2940
02:02:35,622 --> 02:02:36,872
Otherwise she may have a brain stroke,

2941
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:38,539
she has anxiety issues.

2942
02:02:40,497 --> 02:02:42,497
She does not have anxiety issues...

2943
02:02:42,747 --> 02:02:43,789
It's Cerebral Aneurysm.

2944
02:02:45,039 --> 02:02:45,872
Who said that!?

2945
02:02:57,331 --> 02:02:58,331
Which doctor said this!?

2946
02:02:58,872 --> 02:03:00,956
Either he has misguided you
or misjudged you.

2947
02:03:02,414 --> 02:03:03,206
No doctor,

2948
02:03:03,331 --> 02:03:04,331
he's a very big doctor.

2949
02:03:05,789 --> 02:03:07,039
Which big doctor is he!?

2950
02:03:07,747 --> 02:03:09,706
As a doctor I have 50 years of experience.

2951
02:03:10,372 --> 02:03:11,664
Is he even that age!?

2952
02:03:12,289 --> 02:03:13,081
It's people like you...

2953
02:03:13,497 --> 02:03:15,247
All the doctors' in big hospitals

2954
02:03:15,331 --> 02:03:17,414
they give certificates
and make them big doctors!

2955
02:03:19,997 --> 02:03:20,997
Look there!

2956
02:03:21,372 --> 02:03:22,164
Your wife...

2957
02:03:22,581 --> 02:03:24,414
How nicely she's talking to everyone.

2958
02:03:26,914 --> 02:03:28,039
Are you sure doctor?

2959
02:03:28,456 --> 02:03:29,372
Damn sure!

2960
02:03:29,956 --> 02:03:30,581
Look!

2961
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:32,706
Your wife has no problems!

2962
02:03:33,247 --> 02:03:35,747
If needed, I'll come to any place and prove it!

2963
02:03:38,747 --> 02:03:39,581
Why did you lie!?

2964
02:03:39,956 --> 02:03:41,081
I didn't lie.

2965
02:03:41,706 --> 02:03:43,706
Cerebral aneurysm is true!

2966
02:03:44,289 --> 02:03:46,206
But not for your wife...

2967
02:03:46,289 --> 02:03:46,789
Then?

2968
02:03:47,539 --> 02:03:48,872
For lawyer Maya!

2969
02:03:53,914 --> 02:03:56,747
She only changed all the reports.

2970
02:03:57,581 --> 02:04:00,247
I have nothing to do with this!

2971
02:04:01,081 --> 02:04:02,581
If you let go of my collar

2972
02:04:03,289 --> 02:04:04,039
I will go to the OT

2973
02:04:04,872 --> 02:04:05,956
and perform her operation

2974
02:04:06,039 --> 02:04:08,247
I will definitely try to save her life!

2975
02:04:30,622 --> 02:04:31,747
I forgot to tell you

2976
02:04:32,539 --> 02:04:34,872
Lawyer Maya sent me a video

2977
02:04:35,289 --> 02:04:36,956
and told me to forward it to you.

2978
02:04:37,747 --> 02:04:40,164
I have already forwarded it to you.

2979
02:04:40,914 --> 02:04:41,956
You have to watch it!

2980
02:04:42,456 --> 02:04:44,789
I'll finish the operation and see you later.

2981
02:04:57,956 --> 02:04:58,997
Should I say 'Hi'

2982
02:05:00,247 --> 02:05:01,747
or 'Bye' I don't know!

2983
02:05:02,747 --> 02:05:04,081
I am now going for operation now

2984
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:05,539
but I don't know.

2985
02:05:06,664 --> 02:05:07,581
Anyway,

2986
02:05:08,664 --> 02:05:10,789
the reason I'm making this video

2987
02:05:11,456 --> 02:05:13,081
is that you two should be fine.

2988
02:05:13,914 --> 02:05:15,581
Have you ever thought...

2989
02:05:16,581 --> 02:05:17,539
At the start of the marriage,

2990
02:05:17,581 --> 02:05:18,414
a husband and wife...

2991
02:05:18,747 --> 02:05:20,247
How happy they are?

2992
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:22,247
But eventually...

2993
02:05:22,956 --> 02:05:24,914
How that happiness gets ruined?

2994
02:05:25,289 --> 02:05:26,039
If you think about it,

2995
02:05:26,539 --> 02:05:28,081
you'll find a 1000 reasons.

2996
02:05:29,581 --> 02:05:31,081
But the real reason is

2997
02:05:31,997 --> 02:05:33,081
both of them!

2998
02:05:34,206 --> 02:05:36,331
Actually marriage

2999
02:05:36,747 --> 02:05:38,372
is a big change that happens in life.

3000
02:05:38,622 --> 02:05:42,039
What begins as 'We' and 'Ours' in
the newly married phase

3001
02:05:42,289 --> 02:05:43,247
eventually becomes

3002
02:05:43,622 --> 02:05:45,747
'Me' and 'Mine'.

3003
02:05:45,956 --> 02:05:47,997
In your case also that is what happened...

3004
02:05:48,372 --> 02:05:49,872
My partner is like this

3005
02:05:50,122 --> 02:05:52,247
and understanding and accepting it

3006
02:05:52,831 --> 02:05:54,664
you have to celebrate it.

3007
02:05:55,122 --> 02:05:56,289
Your relationship

3008
02:05:56,539 --> 02:05:57,997
was ruined to such an extent that

3009
02:05:58,497 --> 02:06:00,331
to understand yourselves

3010
02:06:00,581 --> 02:06:02,872
death had to come between you!

3011
02:06:03,081 --> 02:06:03,914
Because...

3012
02:06:05,622 --> 02:06:07,122
It's only when you face death,

3013
02:06:08,747 --> 02:06:10,206
that you understand the value of life.

3014
02:06:12,789 --> 02:06:14,247
Life is very short!

3015
02:06:15,206 --> 02:06:16,956
Learn to be happy...

3016
02:06:18,039 --> 02:06:20,039
To bring out your love for each other,

3017
02:06:21,122 --> 02:06:22,289
what disease I had,

3018
02:06:23,081 --> 02:06:25,039
I lied that Pooja had it!

3019
02:06:26,331 --> 02:06:27,456
If you were hurt,

3020
02:06:28,831 --> 02:06:29,872
please forgive me...

3021
02:06:31,539 --> 02:06:32,664
Till now

3022
02:06:33,581 --> 02:06:34,956
I have never lost a case

3023
02:06:35,372 --> 02:06:36,706
but in your case

3024
02:06:37,747 --> 02:06:39,622
I really wish to lose.

3025
02:06:41,289 --> 02:06:42,122
Please think about it...

3026
02:06:45,872 --> 02:06:46,372
Bye!

3027
02:07:39,331 --> 02:07:40,206
Look over here!

3028
02:07:41,706 --> 02:07:42,706
Don't look at your grandfather!

3029
02:07:43,706 --> 02:07:44,539
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

3030
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:46,164
Take the apple and hit him!

3031
02:07:46,456 --> 02:07:46,872
Hit him!

3032
02:07:47,622 --> 02:07:47,997
What Deep!?

3033
02:07:47,998 --> 02:07:49,039
Can't you do what I told you!

3034
02:07:49,747 --> 02:07:50,831
I told you that I'll do it.

3035
02:07:50,872 --> 02:07:51,997
Okay, it's fine.

3036
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:54,164
- Why do you worry? I told you that I'll do it.
- Hit him...

3037
02:07:54,664 --> 02:07:55,581
Sweetheart!

3038
02:07:56,622 --> 02:07:57,456
My child...

3039
02:07:57,789 --> 02:07:59,247
You are not like your grandfather!
