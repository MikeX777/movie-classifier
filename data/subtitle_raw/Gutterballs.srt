1
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,666
I would score that ass!

2
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,666
Cheers, guys.
Sit down.

3
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:02,957
You took the wrong bullet, Lisa.

4
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:05,163
Here we use larger ones.

5
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:09,596
I have never encountered
With such large and heavy balls.

6
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:16,036
Stupid bitch!
Fuck you all! Damn fools!

7
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:19,996
If that shitty transvestite ever looks at me again....
He loves you, Joey.

8
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,556
It makes me sick to my stomach.
Ignore them!

9
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:26,044
Steve is furious that you didn't give him on the ball.

10
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:29,119
Yes, and that you did it with his best friend.

11
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:32,523
I never wanted to date Steve.

12
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:35,281
I used it to get closer to Jamie.

13
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,279
And I succeeded, didn't I?

14
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,206
Hey, Lisa, you have a great skirt.

15
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,962
We came just in time.

16
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:29,516
I would like to be able to walk without panties,
But I have to wait until after the surgery.

17
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,366
Isn't that unfair?

18
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,760
Asshole!
Let's put on the shoes.

19
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:40,439
Hey, John Bon, where are you going?
Shut up!

20
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:44,096
Screw it, Steve.

21
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,886
I should.

22
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:54,840
You could use some real bullets, Lisa,
and I have just such a pair here!

23
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:59,843
Shut up, A. J.
You don't have to show your balls here!

24
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:02,376
Idiot.

25
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,039
Lisa needs a real guy.

26
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,917
One with experience.

27
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:14,163
Why are you an expert, Steve?

28
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,685
Do you think you're a great pick-up artist?

29
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:25,202
At least I'm not a faggot,
shitty transvestite!

30
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:30,885
Unless I were to look at your pussy, huh?

31
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,941
Was that the experience you were asking about?

32
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,395
Guys, why don't you explain it to him?

33
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:39,999
With pleasure!

34
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:42,443
You're right, Steve.

35
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,758
Take her, or him
And let him try his luck.

36
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,323
Come on!

37
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:52,041
We will show him!

38
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,523
Back off!

39
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,086
Fuck off!

40
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,807
Leave me alone!

41
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:04,956
Just take a look!

42
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,836
Screw you!

43
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:10,686
Take a look at this cutie!

44
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:14,926
Leave it!

45
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,723
Leave the fag!

46
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,360
Are you okay?
Why are you doing this?

47
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:27,325
It's been a long time since anyone treated me like this.

48
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:32,966
This is between you and me Steve!

49
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:34,277
One on one!

50
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:38,596
Fuck you!

51
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,602
Come on Jamie!
Fuck him up!

52
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,640
Damn!

53
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:23,196
Shut up, you fucking bitch!

54
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:35,680
You think that when you fucked
The girl I took to the ball,

55
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,599
then you are better than me!

56
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:43,682
What were you thinking?

57
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,237
Was it worth it?

58
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,085
Keep your mouths shut!

59
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:52,359
You've slipped, huh!

60
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,524
Shut up!

61
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,964
Bitch!

62
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:16,837
You all better get out of here,
Before I call the cops.

63
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,557
I let you stay longer
and this is how you repay me now!

64
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,200
Are you all right?

65
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,119
Let's get the hell out of here.

66
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,126
Jamie, come on, baby.

67
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,042
What about the game?

68
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,764
We have a tournament to play.

69
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,839
Doesn't anyone care about bowling anymore?
Forget about bowling.

70
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:44,159
I bet 100 bucks that they will not win.

71
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,443
How are we supposed to win when
Steve is not able to play!

72
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,802
We can't play, don't you understand!

73
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:51,561
He can't play in such a state!

74
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,287
I said something!

75
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,562
Get out!

76
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:59,800
You can play tomorrow, provided,
That you will behave somehow....

77
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:05,041
You will regret it! You will see it yet!

78
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,959
My leg!

79
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:09,957
You're the one who started it, Steve!
We wanted to play, but you ruined it!

80
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:10,887
As usual!

81
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,765
We will meet tomorrow.

82
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,316
What do you think, Steve?

83
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,567
Driving. Patrick and Joey
will drive you to the hospital.

84
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,599
I have work tomorrow morning!

85
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,517
Are you still distributing newspapers, AJ?
Actually, yes.

86
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:28,515
My mother saw him,
as he peeped at her through the window.

87
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:31,406
Nonsense!
I would believe him.

88
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,446
If I saw him at my place,
he would get a good manto.

89
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:38,405
Okay, that's enough!

90
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:41,679
What's the matter, are you all queer?

91
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,684
Just talking about it...

92
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:51,125
When I was young,
we only talked about pussy....

93
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:54,843
You won't see any more pussy with your eyes, old man!
It's disgusting, I don't want to hear it!

94
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,645
Are we done?

95
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:59,845
Okay...
That's until tomorrow...

96
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:02,726
The bet still stands.
Double the bet or none at all.

97
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,203
Better take your wallet with you!

98
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:09,440
And you kids, better leave
your troubles at home tomorrow....

99
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,723
There will be no trouble, we promise.

100
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,556
It would be better if...

101
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:21,639
Let's go!

102
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,437
Better go home now!

103
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,204
It's quite a mess. You need to clean up here.

104
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:33,519
I will call your mother,
that will help me, smart.

105
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,000
Come on, ladies!

106
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:04,356
Damn, that was a good one, Lisa!

107
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,926
But also stupid...

108
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,165
She wanted to protect you...

109
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,919
I can take care of myself.

110
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,604
Steve's foot crunched like a grape.

111
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,041
Have you seen it?

112
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,641
And so he will play, he is the best of them.

113
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:25,083
This guy is a machine.
If he had to, he'd throw his own head around.

114
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,680
Can I go with you?

115
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:27,797
Thanks.

116
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:32,761
Call me later, Lisa.

117
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,836
Thanks.
All will be well.

118
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:38,556
Until tomorrow!

119
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:47,084
Did you see my purse?
You must have left it inside.

120
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,566
There is still someone inside.

121
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:50,436
I will go with you.

122
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:54,887
No, it is not necessary.

123
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:56,162
Are you sure?

124
00:10:56,687 --> 00:10:58,598
Yes, I'll be fine.

125
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:17,396
Damn!

126
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:19,236
Come on!

127
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:20,556
Come on!

128
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:28,681
Another damn chewing gum....

129
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:53,117
Damn shit...

130
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,316
How about at the vending machines?

131
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:32,485
This is what you are looking for!

132
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:35,999
I warned you, bitch!

133
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,675
You will pay me now!

134
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,206
Come on, Steve!

135
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:45,077
And now you will give me,
What I was entitled to, bitch!

136
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,081
Shut up!

137
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,282
Put it on this machine!

138
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:25,759
Shut up!

139
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:27,155
Don't tear up!

140
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,396
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

141
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:34,996
Not bad!

142
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,363
Download it!

143
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:41,842
Hey, I thought we wanted to
scare her just a little bit.

144
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:46,285
She's about to get scared, but with the size of my cock!

145
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,083
Do something to make it shut up!

146
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,044
You are spoiling the whole atmosphere!

147
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:54,359
Come on, Steve!
Pat, watch out for that old guy!

148
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:00,880
You are still here!
Get the hell out of here!

149
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:10,879
I think she likes it.

150
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,445
Oh yes!

151
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,843
Come on Steve, fuck her!

152
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:20,876
Fuck her!

153
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,085
You like that, huh?

154
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,398
I have a bigger one than Jamie, huh?

155
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:29,286
Steve, you don't have to be so brutal.

156
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:33,243
You need to be more gentle.

157
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,396
Dirty whore!

158
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,443
I wouldn't have guessed it was that good!

159
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:41,167
A.J. share it?

160
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:44,760
Do you know how cool it would be?

161
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,201
No way, man!

162
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,756
I don't want to see your mouth!

163
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,081
Suit yourself...

164
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,404
Fuck you, bitch!

165
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,877
You will not embarrass me....

166
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:03,398
What were you thinking!

167
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:05,679
You shitty bitch!

168
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,641
Fucking bitch!

169
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:31,841
I will come back here.

170
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,685
Get out of my way!

171
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:35,276
Fuck!

172
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:57,362
Beautiful ass you have!

173
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:02,682
We will close all the holes!

174
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:39,846
Joey, now it's your turn!

175
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,725
It was awesome!

176
00:16:41,887 --> 00:16:44,242
Let's go now...
Shut up!

177
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:48,239
You will be next!

178
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,404
Don't shudder, you'll be next!

179
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,004
Fuck you!

180
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,840
Shut up Patrick!
You are such a wimp!

181
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:12,083
Where to, the lazy man?

182
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,641
My colleague Joey will take care of you.

183
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:19,367
We're having fun.

184
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,044
We will have a decent time.

185
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,562
Where are you going, dear reader?

186
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,481
Hurry up, man!

187
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:49,957
Yes, Joey, show her!

188
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,077
Hold it, Patrick!

189
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,199
You're useful for something!

190
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,200
What are you doing?
Bring it on!

191
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,282
Fuck!
What!

192
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,523
I can't finish!
Damn!

193
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:27,679
Hey, help me out a little!

194
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:31,165
Well, do something!

195
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,242
That's right!

196
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,359
Guess who's next?

197
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,240
No, I don't feel like it.

198
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:06,636
What?

199
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,402
Don't refuse! You'll be next!

200
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,080
But I don't want to!

201
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:14,239
What a wimp!
They'll be closing the door in a minute!

202
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:17,797
We have to go!

203
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,404
We're not done yet...

204
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,723
Unless I say so.

205
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,038
Steve, but Patrick is right.

206
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:34,596
Keep it up!

207
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:41,325
We're almost done, baby.

208
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:45,236
Everything has a beginning and an end!

209
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,764
Get ready, slut.

210
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,721
Come on, Steve!

211
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,883
Are you the boss, Pat?

212
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:00,882
Do you want to talk about what will happen?

213
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:04,046
Okay, so you do it!

214
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:05,401
What not!

215
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:08,877
Take it and fuck her with it.

216
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:10,116
I won't do it!

217
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:14,326
You do it, or I'll fuck you!

218
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,964
Take off his pants!

219
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,277
Give it a rest already Steve.
This is messed up.

220
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,285
I won't.

221
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:25,356
You know I'm going to do it, cocksucker!

222
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,964
Do it!

223
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:30,444
Damn it!

224
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:31,956
Come on, boy!

225
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:36,796
Sorry!

226
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,276
Not this tip.

227
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,036
What?

228
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:53,161
Use a bigger tip!

229
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,921
Steve, stop it already!

230
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:57,885
Come on!

231
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,160
It's too big!

232
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,319
Only deep!

233
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:15,886
Fucking bitch!

234
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:32,676
Good boy!

235
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:40,686
Now you know not to mess with me!

236
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,202
Bitch!
Let's get out of here!

237
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:51,322
Get the hell out of here!

238
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,036
Kurwa....

239
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:37,162
Open the door!

240
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,437
Get in the car!
Open the damn door!

241
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:42,677
What are you doing?

242
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:44,405
Quick!

243
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:47,206
What's up!
Open the damn door!

244
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,159
What are you waiting for?

245
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:52,919
Get in!
What's the matter with you?

246
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:55,403
My leg...

247
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,525
Do you think it will say anything?

248
00:22:57,687 --> 00:23:00,201
He won't say.

249
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,365
Yes, who would believe a chicken?

250
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,736
Me.
What.

251
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:10,120
Me!
Would you believe it?

252
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:44,805
NEXT NIGHT

253
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,959
Hi.
Hi, girls.

254
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:03,560
Give it to me.

255
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,201
Where's Lisa?

256
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:08,201
Jamie called to her.

257
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:09,595
They will be here soon.

258
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,723
I hope today will not be a mess.

259
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:12,876
Of course not!

260
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,724
They are always looking for a hook.

261
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,764
But if we win, they will probably
they will make a brothel again.

262
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:19,280
What "if?"

263
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:23,001
Please, Sam...
You know we will destroy them.

264
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:24,839
We are the best.
I know.

265
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,645
Will they bring their hookers?

266
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:28,924
Do you think so?
And are they good?

267
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:31,120
Not like ours!

268
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:33,597
Super, Ben.

269
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,446
I would like to be someone's whore.

270
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,678
Sam, I was going to ask you...

271
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:41,315
Do you pee in women's or men's restrooms?

272
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:44,081
Very funny.

273
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:47,603
I'll pee on your mouth, because I know,
That you will like it.

274
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:49,446
You are disgusting.

275
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:55,081
Hey, ready to fail?

276
00:24:57,087 --> 00:25:00,124
We will destroy you idiots!

277
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:03,085
You dreamed to me today, princess!
You have great feathers!

278
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:04,805
I'm already looking forward to it,
until you take off your shirt.

279
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,925
Did you know that you are a moron!

280
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:09,999
Want more?

281
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:13,964
Did you see their faces?

282
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:15,446
I hate those suckers!

283
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,125
Enjoy your evening!

284
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:24,957
Have you ever seen such a beautiful ass?
Where are you going?

285
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,516
Hey, stay with us today!

286
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,524
You can only dream about such an ass.

287
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:36,240
You are not funny at all, grandpa!

288
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,237
Why don't you answer one question for us?

289
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:42,041
Do you old people get screwed at all?

290
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,677
I bet you see your
little one only during peeing!

291
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,129
Be careful what you say, boy.

292
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,879
I am doing you a favor,
That you can play at such a time.

293
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,275
Do you understand?

294
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,358
You say it every time, Grandpa.

295
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,476
There go the faggots.
And it's a big bird!

296
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:02,806
Beautiful feathers!
Would you like one, eh?

297
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:05,481
You look like a hyena.

298
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,761
I know they like it.

299
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:12,363
Do you know that if you want to have fun
have fun, you have to pay for it?

300
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:13,846
We don't mind.

301
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:17,676
Are these shoes clean, Egerton?
I don't want to catch anything...

302
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:20,236
That's right, Edgerton!

303
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:22,045
Do you go to a private school?

304
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,120
Out!

305
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,755
I'm a size six.
And I'm a size eleven.

306
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:33,276
Twelve?

307
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,164
Then which one should I take?

308
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,601
Where is Jamie?

309
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,246
Take these, Einstein.

310
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:40,396
He should already be here.

311
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:43,605
And if Steve comes first?
That won't be a problem at all.

312
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:47,316
If anything... I have my secret weapon.

313
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,796
Where did you get this?

314
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:54,160
From Mexico.
I smuggled it in my luggage.

315
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:59,917
You better be careful with that, Sam,
or someone will stick it up your ass.

316
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:03,124
I don't even know how to use it.

317
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:07,604
Let's hope you never find out.

318
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:11,523
Fuck, my leg!

319
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,882
He brought his hookers.

320
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,916
Let me!

321
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:19,522
Let me go, bitches!

322
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,798
I can't walk!

323
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:27,399
I parked my car in a handicapped spot
Handicapped spot, they better not tow it away from me!

324
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:33,119
If you have the right credentials,
you don't risk anything.

325
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:36,802
But you are taking a risk. If something happens to him,
those bullets will be sticking out of your ass, old man!

326
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:40,084
Everything is supposed to be in order!
Do you understand?

327
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,201
Fuck...

328
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:45,716
You got your shoes!

329
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:49,915
And these are for... ladies.

330
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,486
Damn the leg!

331
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,602
And something for your cast.
I don't want any scratches on the dance floor!

332
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:59,796
Steve, put it on you?
It's just like a condom.

333
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,525
Of course, love.

334
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:04,247
And you bring me some beer!
Make yourself useful for something.

335
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:07,763
Calm. I can't be in two places at once.

336
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,076
Why not?

337
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,603
And do you know how far it is?

338
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:16,082
You won't know until you go.

339
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,521
Hurry up!

340
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,436
Steve!

341
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,286
Nice slice!

342
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:34,203
Damn cocksucker!

343
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:36,120
Son of a bitch!

344
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:38,836
She had the audacity to show up!
Who?

345
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:41,443
Lisa, the odd one out!

346
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:43,996
What a whore!
It's sexy!

347
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,686
Do you think she likes girls?

348
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:49,556
Now you probably do, stupid cow!

349
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,524
What do you have in mind?

350
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,446
I'm just teasing you!
The game is about to begin!

351
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:56,998
Come on, Sam!

352
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:02,759
Bravo, Sam!
Look who's coming!

353
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:05,236
Good to see you, Lisa.

354
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,324
Look at these savages!

355
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:12,042
A photo to remember!

356
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:15,157
It must be hard for you to see them again.

357
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,000
I have to go to the toilet.

358
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,922
We are about to start.

359
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,160
Lisa, I am so sorry!

360
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:06,076
I didn't want....

361
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:08,438
Don't blame me!
I tried to stop them.

362
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,523
I didn't want to come here at all today....

363
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,765
I just wanted to see if you would come....

364
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,600
and see...

365
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:19,565
Sorry. Forgive me.

366
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:22,639
Are you afraid, Patrick?
Am I afraid?

367
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:25,367
You came to see if I would notify the police!

368
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:28,325
It's not like that...
Are you afraid that you will be canned!

369
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:29,397
No, I swear...

370
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:31,125
You raped me!

371
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:34,402
Did you enjoy it?
Did it stand up for you?

372
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:37,002
Please Liso, don't do this....

373
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,283
What?
This?

374
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,044
Do you think an apology is enough?

375
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,840
Yesterday you guys had fun!

376
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:50,276
Today is my turn!

377
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,480
Are you ready to play the game, the burly people?

378
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,878
Suck it for me!

379
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,162
Screw you!

380
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,999
We are still waiting for Patrick!

381
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,839
Sorry, here we go.

382
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:09,085
We have two teams, to begin with
there will be three players in each.

383
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:11,443
Can it be?

384
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,236
Here we go!

385
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:29,882
Watch out for my leg!

386
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:31,641
Come on, AJ!

387
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,837
You are very sexy today, Sarah.

388
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,079
Scary!

389
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:48,076
Totally sucked!
It wasn't the worst.

390
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,356
Thanks!

391
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:04,756
BBK?
Who is the BBK?

392
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:07,326
Have you come to see my crutches?

393
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,125
No asshole, we said there are three people in the team!

394
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:13,439
There are three of us: me, him and him!

395
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:16,286
Can't you read?
then who is BBK, you idiot?

396
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:20,841
I don't know and I don't give a damn.
We're playing!

397
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:23,039
I'll tell the carpenter to delete it.

398
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:26,724
Shut up and play!

399
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:28,800
Next Sarah.
We'll show them!

400
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:32,558
Aren't we waiting for Lisa?

401
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:34,604
No, he is in the next team, with me and Cindy.

402
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:36,605
Come on!

403
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,237
Come on, gold, show that you are a champion!

404
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,446
I am not dreaming!

405
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,397
Come on, you bastards!

406
00:32:57,967 --> 00:32:59,320
Excellent throw!

407
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,197
Will you help me get the fuck up!

408
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,597
You win, baby!

409
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,644
I have no desire to lose.

410
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,763
Show how you win!

411
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:13,521
Pepper leg!

412
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,439
You can win!

413
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,881
Get the fuck out!

414
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:21,440
Shut the fuck up!

415
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:24,167
Or I'll put this bullet in your cunt!

416
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,556
Just try it!

417
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:30,276
Fuck!

418
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:31,846
Damn the leg!

419
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:35,957
Shut your mouth, transvestite!

420
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:39,483
Or I'll cut off your dick!
You shut up too!

421
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:42,878
Heed my words!
I will kick your ass!

422
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:46,085
It's going to be a long night.

423
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,156
Yes.

424
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,886
What is it?

425
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,998
Hey, what is it?

426
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:00,005
I drank your beer.

427
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,727
What is it supposed to be?
Sorry.

428
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,320
Damn cunt!

429
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:06,876
Bring me the fucking beer!

430
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,957
Stupid bitch!

431
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:13,682
Sorry.
You'll give me a blow job as punishment!

432
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:22,682
Why don't you move your ass, old man?

433
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:26,965
You have to pay in cash.
I have no idea how I could collect the debt from you.

434
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,958
That probably wouldn't be so bad.

435
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,765
Your orders.
Hi.

436
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,597
Hi.
Are you playing today?

437
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:36,756
Yes.

438
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:39,598
Are you on Steve's team?

439
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:41,679
I don't give a damn about Steve.

440
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,246
But maybe I will play.

441
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,245
I thought you were one of his girls.

442
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:48,039
I am definitely someone.

443
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,000
That's for sure!

444
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:52,160
Sweet you are.

445
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:55,279
Hey, go now!
Here's your beer.

446
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,315
I'll pay.

447
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:59,837
But it's not for me.
Never mind.

448
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:01,715
This is for Steve.

449
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:04,481
In that case... I'll pee on it.

450
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:07,557
Right.
Seriously?

451
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,076
And why not?
After all, he's an asshole.

452
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:13,598
I hang out with him because
he is with Hannah, my friend.

453
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:16,601
Sometimes I join them.

454
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:19,118
This Steve is an asshole,
But he's damn lucky.

455
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:21,881
Tell me that's not the case?
Not tonight, anyway.

456
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:24,677
In my opinion, his luck has already run out.

457
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,438
It's none of your business, shithead!
Fuck you!

458
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,235
Tell your mother that I will be late today.

459
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:39,316
It doesn't fly.

460
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:47,996
Don't look!

461
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,284
Or can I touch?

462
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:33,798
Guess what my favorite year is?

463
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:36,797
69?
Yes!

464
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:53,196
Steve!

465
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,364
Where is my beer?

466
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:03,640
It smells like roses!

467
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:04,842
You are so sweet.

468
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:10,003
Yes, right there!

469
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,316
You know how it's done!

470
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:47,205
I can feel your teeth!

471
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,155
You're biting me...

472
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:55,720
Fuck, you bit me!

473
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:00,925
Get off my back.

474
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,721
Come on, Sam!

475
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:08,884
Bravo, Sam!

476
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:11,880
Where is Lisa!
She went to the restroom.

477
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,725
She looked strange today.

478
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:16,038
She did not speak at all.

479
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:17,805
She looked like she was depressed.

480
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,727
He doesn't usually behave this way.

481
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:23,599
Maybe it's the influence of the moon.

482
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:27,564
And what do you know about it?
It's just an assumption.

483
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:30,839
You may be right.
I'm always in the mood.

484
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:36,600
Will you also get your period after surgery?

485
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,998
He's not menstruating, Jamie!
No....

486
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,319
My heart is bleeding!

487
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:45,883
Everyone judges me, but no one
really knows me!

488
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:51,436
Good...

489
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,916
We don't judge you at all,
We love you as you are, Sam.

490
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,321
Thanks.

491
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,280
I need to fix my makeup.

492
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,756
Cindy, why don't you replace me,
I'll go and refresh myself a bit.

493
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:05,916
Sure...

494
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:07,596
Thanks.

495
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,920
What's up?

496
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:13,647
Hey, take a look at this!

497
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:19,476
Fuck!

498
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:21,638
What is it?
I don't know.

499
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,238
I would also like such a skull.

500
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:28,086
Don't you think that's a little strange?

501
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:33,446
We don't know whose initials these are.

502
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:40,485
They are probably making fun of us.

503
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,285
Someone is sure to know something about it.

504
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,763
BBK, kiss my ass!

505
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:47,675
I don't understand the symbol.

506
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,723
That means death, right?

507
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,805
Whose is it?

508
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:22,515
Xcalibur, listening!

509
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:25,876
Hello!

510
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,476
Hello!

511
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:35,241
Who is talking?

512
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:41,001
I told you not to call here.

513
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:45,476
If I get you, I'll strangle you with my own eggs.

514
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:48,956
Hello!

515
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,605
Strange...

516
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,559
No signal...

517
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,118
Deaf as a stump...

518
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:02,720
Motherfuckers....

519
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:12,362
I'm going, I'm going...

520
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,835
Fuck!

521
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:14,996
Have you seen it?

522
00:42:15,607 --> 00:42:16,722
So what?

523
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:19,526
If it wasn't for this leg of mine, I would have shown you too.

524
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:22,163
Where did your spirit go
Of fighting yesterday, Steve?

525
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:26,003
Ask those shitty balls, Joey,
Or they'll end up in your ass!

526
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:27,806
You first...

527
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:30,322
If we're talking about fighting spirit,
then where has Patrick gone?

528
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:34,040
BBK wins!

529
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,481
Two strikes, eh?

530
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:39,484
Throw!

531
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:46,802
A one-man band?
What the fuck is this?

532
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:49,523
This is a computer!
This is not any BBK!

533
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,599
This we do not know....

534
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,321
Hello?

535
00:42:58,767 --> 00:42:59,756
Lisa?

536
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:05,476
I could have taken the eye-liner.
This crayon sucks.

537
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,764
Don't you happen to have something in your purse?

538
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:15,396
Hello?

539
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,639
I'm starting to get scared.

540
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:23,121
Who is there?

541
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,439
Is there anyone here?

542
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,722
Jesus Christ...

543
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:36,203
Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?

544
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:39,726
Hello?

545
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,078
It's not funny.

546
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:48,718
You guys are starting to piss me off!

547
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:51,757
If I don't hear from you, I'll call the manager....

548
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,046
Did something happen to you?

549
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:57,396
Fuck!

550
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:00,199
I know someone is out there!

551
00:44:00,927 --> 00:44:02,406
Who the heck is there!

552
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:05,156
Who are you?

553
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:13,236
Sons of bitches!

554
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:19,839
Are you ready?

555
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,360
Come on, brother!

556
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:29,325
Fuck Patrick!
We don't need that fag here!

557
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:31,398
Hey, bitches!

558
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:35,399
Where did Julia go?

559
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:37,603
She went, but did not return!

560
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:40,999
Go and get me a beer!

561
00:44:41,607 --> 00:44:43,040
This time it's supposed to be full!

562
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:46,836
If you are polite.

563
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,682
Do you want something?

564
00:44:49,927 --> 00:44:53,966
A big and wet pussy!
For me too, but not so wet.

565
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:55,885
Do you like the girls from the opposing team?

566
00:44:56,047 --> 00:44:59,801
Yes, Joey likes the one with the dick.
Fuck you, AJ.

567
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:03,676
Is there a transvestite there?
Before or after the surgery?

568
00:45:04,687 --> 00:45:08,316
I don't know! Ask him yourself.

569
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:18,645
You can find a blonde with a dick in the toilet.

570
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,959
Don't kill me!

571
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:28,516
Please...

572
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:31,240
I will do anything you want.

573
00:45:32,207 --> 00:45:34,004
Really everything.

574
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:38,604
Hear...

575
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:41,245
I'll give you a blow job!

576
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:43,480
Anytime!

577
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:48,722
I'll do whatever you want!

578
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:52,246
I'm good at it!

579
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:55,558
Do you want to touch me?

580
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:59,522
If you want it, do it.

581
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,966
Please!

582
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,845
I'll do anything...

583
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:15,962
Damn it!

584
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:18,683
Our friend scored again.

585
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:19,996
What?

586
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:22,166
Never mind!

587
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:25,684
Stay focused.
Someone here is making a fool of us.

588
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,959
I bet it's Steve and his stooges.

589
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:31,525
I'll look around.

590
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:34,357
Julia can play.

591
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,997
We are still together.

592
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:40,044
We are one of a kind...

593
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:51,683
Hey, boss, how about....
All is well...

594
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:59,238
You have to be with the losers.

595
00:47:59,407 --> 00:48:02,205
Don't you want to join
My winning team?

596
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,563
It is never too late to change colors.

597
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:08,885
You may not have seen the other pretty
girl from my team?

598
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:13,963
She was with you and the assholes.

599
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:17,039
I poured her a drink.

600
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:20,281
She went with one of your stupid friends.

601
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:22,005
My colleagues?

602
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:25,675
With Dave? Impossible!

603
00:48:25,927 --> 00:48:28,805
Dave and pussy are like water and fire.

604
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:30,275
Are you sure?

605
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:33,200
Should I speak more clearly?
Of course I'm sure.

606
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:34,959
They left together.

607
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:38,761
Will you give this beer to Steve?

608
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:40,519
I need to find Julia.

609
00:48:40,967 --> 00:48:41,956
Bright.

610
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:45,166
I'll set her off later.

611
00:48:45,327 --> 00:48:47,443
What's your name? Matt?

612
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:50,766
Probably Doormat (doormat).

613
00:48:55,407 --> 00:48:57,762
Dave is having his lucky day today.

614
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:02,086
I'll give him a beer already....

615
00:49:02,247 --> 00:49:04,966
You can shove them up your ass, I don't care!

616
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:12,482
I have already sent two girls,
To bring me that beer!

617
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:15,320
What are they doing there!

618
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:19,236
I bet they are having fun with each other.

619
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,996
They're probably lollygagging somewhere.

620
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:27,764
I want to see it.
Give me the damn bullets!

621
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:36,079
First of all, these are my whores, do you understand?

622
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:40,082
Second, there were only three of us left....

623
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:43,842
And you play like patsies!
So you stay here!

624
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:45,235
And thirdly....

625
00:49:45,407 --> 00:49:49,685
The only thing these whores will lick,
Is my balls, but that's after the game!

626
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:53,202
Fuck...

627
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:56,643
Speaking of crutches, I need to wax mine.

628
00:49:57,687 --> 00:49:59,757
What are you? A faggot of some kind?

629
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:01,758
I'm talking about bowling balls.

630
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:04,487
How do you know that fags wax their balls?

631
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:05,762
Shut up!

632
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:07,485
Watch out
Then sit tight!

633
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:09,478
And while you're there, bring me some beer.

634
00:50:10,327 --> 00:50:11,316
Right.

635
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:13,756
Screw you!

636
00:50:14,207 --> 00:50:15,925
Keep.

637
00:50:16,207 --> 00:50:19,040
I will have to impress your girls somehow.

638
00:50:20,447 --> 00:50:23,359
Steve's girls.
What do you do?

639
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:24,916
Give it to me, whore.

640
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:28,599
What the hell was that supposed to be!

641
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:30,201
Christ!

642
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:33,915
After all, he duped yesterday.
What's his problem?

643
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:07,803
Waxomat....
"Please place the ball in the hole."

644
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:13,005
"I like your big ball"....
What a robot, great!

645
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,761
"Insert coin."

646
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:26,518
"Waxomat will now improve the speed and accuracy of the bullet.

647
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:30,724
"Shut up, you idiot."

648
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:42,000
"Do you think you're a police officer?"

649
00:51:43,247 --> 00:51:45,044
"It's a joke."

650
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:47,403
Okay, what do we have here...
Super gloss?

651
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:49,121
"Supergloss.
Excellent.

652
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:51,482
Polishing.

653
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:53,717
Hot wax.

654
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:56,356
"Do not touch the burning wax."

655
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,441
Fuck!

656
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:01,160
"Debil."

657
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:03,036
Fuck!

658
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:12,362
Yes, honey, wax my ball.

659
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:21,160
"Your bullet will be ready soon."

660
00:52:22,967 --> 00:52:25,401
Stop, stop!

661
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:27,556
"Waxomat.

662
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,561
Fuck!

663
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,565
Damn!

664
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:37,483
"More and more people are using
of waxing services."

665
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:40,485
He scratched my ball!

666
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:42,558
Please insert the coin.

667
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,844
Fuck you!

668
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:47,123
"Put the ball in the hole."

669
00:52:48,527 --> 00:52:50,119
"Just don't go to sleep."

670
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:52,965
They fit right in, huh?

671
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:54,916
Yes.

672
00:52:55,287 --> 00:52:57,437
But Jamie feels something for Lisa.

673
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,080
Really?
Yes.

674
00:52:59,247 --> 00:53:02,284
Lisa is not bad,
But Sara is the real bomb!

675
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:07,916
What kind of bomb? Sometimes even shit can be good.

676
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:11,035
Sorry, but I don't do that.

677
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:15,082
Are you a natural blonde?

678
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,637
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?

679
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:21,484
A long time ago, if you want to know already.

680
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:23,160
I'm curious.

681
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,162
Right.

682
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,080
I know some who like secrets.

683
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:34,201
I sit at home with my guitar all the time.
This makes me a little shy.

684
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,961
Now I'm excited!

685
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:38,116
Really?

686
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:41,404
I didn't think I would have such an effect on you....

687
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:53,965
Don't you want to go somewhere off to the side?

688
00:53:54,527 --> 00:53:55,846
When we are done playing.

689
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:58,760
Ben, standing up.

690
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:00,405
After all, it stands!

691
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:07,476
Hey, the dumbass!

692
00:54:08,807 --> 00:54:10,718
Your fucking
Waxomat destroyed my ball.

693
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:14,362
It's your fault. I want a new ball.

694
00:54:15,367 --> 00:54:16,356
First of all, dung....

695
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:18,643
There is a renovation there and it is not allowed to enter.

696
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:24,040
And secondly...

697
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:26,958
You are a fucking idiot.

698
00:54:27,127 --> 00:54:29,561
This bullet broke down on its own.

699
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:32,366
And the machine just does the work for you.

700
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:35,362
I see no fault of my own here...

701
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,842
Open your eyes, moron!

702
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:40,397
There is a huge crack at the bottom.

703
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:43,525
This machine is broken.

704
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:44,961
I want a new bullet and that's it.

705
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,806
Take yourself the bullets that lie by the tracks.

706
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:49,527
The bullets there are one big crap.

707
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:52,565
I want a new one, fuck!
Take it easy!

708
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,805
Or I'll kick your balls.

709
00:54:55,647 --> 00:55:02,359
Be good and get back on track,
and I might bring you something from the store.

710
00:55:02,607 --> 00:55:04,916
If you are lucky.
Luck?

711
00:55:05,447 --> 00:55:07,199
Are you talking about happiness?

712
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:12,159
The lucky thing is that your
Mother fucked you up like that.

713
00:55:12,327 --> 00:55:15,876
You are lucky that I stayed
in Bison, otherwise I could have been your father.

714
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:17,646
Very funny...

715
00:55:17,807 --> 00:55:20,321
Where are you going?
I hope to get a new ball!

716
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:22,443
I have to win!
Don't go anywhere!

717
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:24,359
Have your mom bring you one!

718
00:55:30,847 --> 00:55:34,965
Hey, and did you get lost in that toilet?

719
00:55:36,047 --> 00:55:38,481
No.
If anything, Sam got lost.

720
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:39,796
Where did the guy go?

721
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:41,764
Do you refer to him as "the guy"?

722
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:44,123
If he has balls, he's a guy.

723
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:45,635
At least for me.

724
00:55:45,807 --> 00:55:48,321
Do you know that he doesn't like to be called that?

725
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:49,761
Do you see?
What?

726
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:50,757
You said "he."

727
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:52,680
You won!

728
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,358
You know what I meant.

729
00:55:56,847 --> 00:55:58,565
Earth to Lisa.

730
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:02,285
Lisa, can you hear?

731
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:04,321
Hey, Lisa!

732
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:06,280
Are you all right?

733
00:56:07,047 --> 00:56:08,275
Your turn...

734
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:15,078
Shall we take a walk?
You read my mind.

735
00:56:15,607 --> 00:56:17,677
Just come back soon!

736
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:27,320
You are somehow strange today.

737
00:56:28,407 --> 00:56:30,363
What's going on?
Everything is fine!

738
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:33,436
Well...

739
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:36,438
You are different today.

740
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:40,163
You are some kind of pissed off...
I said it's all right!

741
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,286
Give it a rest already.
She's probably on her period.

742
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:52,118
Hey, if a girl behaves like this,
it doesn't mean at all that she must be on her period!

743
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:53,157
Guys!

744
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,035
Do you like what you see?
You are sexy!

745
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:21,636
I know!

746
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:24,757
You have excellent boobs!

747
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,839
Let's do it here!

748
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:44,917
Damn!
What?

749
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:47,357
Fuck, I don't have an eraser!

750
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:49,399
And what will you do now?

751
00:57:49,647 --> 00:57:51,399
Is a blowjob enough for you?

752
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,758
Do you want my moisture?

753
00:57:57,967 --> 00:57:59,320
Toilet!

754
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:02,522
There is a vending machine with rubber bands!

755
00:58:06,407 --> 00:58:07,806
I'll be right back!

756
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:18,920
What the fuck...

757
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:21,081
What else?

758
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,715
First my crutch, and now more track?

759
00:58:25,087 --> 00:58:29,080
Your bullet?
That damn machine scratched my bullet.

760
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:33,117
Did you use it?
I wanted to, but now?

761
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:35,355
What a load of crap!

762
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:41,599
This is automatic.
You have to wait a while.

763
00:58:41,767 --> 00:58:43,883
And what do you think I'm doing?

764
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:47,198
It only moves up and down all the time....

765
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,319
In my opinion, it welded together.

766
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:50,681
Did she mess up?

767
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:53,725
Calm down and I'll reset it!

768
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:55,799
Why don't you go and fix it then!

769
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:58,242
What if you go!

770
00:58:58,407 --> 00:59:00,238
I don't want to argue with you!

771
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:01,886
I had to go to the carpenter to take care of it!

772
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:04,766
What's all the ranting about!
This moron is not back yet!

773
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:05,916
I was there on my own.

774
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:08,318
My whores have also disappeared somewhere.

775
00:59:08,447 --> 00:59:12,759
Pat didn't even show up,
and these survivalists don't give a damn about anything.

776
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:15,361
Yes, it's that damn BBK!

777
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:16,846
They must be together!

778
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:20,643
I will walk over to the bastard.

779
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,877
I'm going to go fix this crap!
I'm going to finish this game.

780
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:27,279
Do you think a screwdriver is good for drinking?

781
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:29,718
In fact, Screwdriver is a drink, stupid.

782
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:32,679
Watch what you say, damn it!

783
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:35,759
The fact that someone didn't get their beer

784
00:59:35,927 --> 00:59:37,565
does not mean that someone else will drink.

785
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:40,666
What do you mean?
Shit.

786
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:41,796
Fuck off!

787
00:59:41,967 --> 00:59:44,765
Speaking of beer, where do you get yours?

788
00:59:44,927 --> 00:59:48,078
You know what, A.J? Why don't you go and get them for me?

789
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:50,636
Make yourself useful for something at last.

790
00:59:51,207 --> 00:59:53,357
And bring my whores if you meet them somewhere.

791
00:59:54,527 --> 00:59:55,926
What the fuck are you looking at?

792
00:59:56,647 --> 01:00:00,196
Shut up!

793
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,403
Just don't forget the fucking beer!

794
01:00:04,887 --> 01:00:07,799
Fucking Steve!
Who does he think he is?

795
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:11,558
If he knew that Hannah gave me a blowjob yesterday....

796
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:13,683
And I didn't even take a shower yesterday.

797
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:25,401
French Desire.

798
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,843
I need something specific...

799
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:31,955
How about "Black Knight?" for the big one?

800
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:35,717
It's for big, black dicks.
Maybe not necessarily for me.

801
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:41,044
Strawberry!
A taste of the first time!

802
01:00:41,207 --> 01:00:42,845
That's it!

803
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:47,965
Taste, after all, is not that important.
After all, there is no tongue in the pussy.

804
01:00:48,207 --> 01:00:49,196
Damn!

805
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:22,557
That damn Steve treats me
Like some kind of lackey.

806
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,485
I would love to kick his ass.

807
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:28,319
Hey, faggot!
And what should it be?

808
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:30,239
Two hookers and a beer.

809
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,006
Beer I can still drink with you, boy.

810
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,397
Very funny, grandpa!

811
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,444
Who is this damned BBK?

812
01:01:39,607 --> 01:01:42,963
What do you say? BB King?
No, BBK, you jerk!

813
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:45,766
The guy who wins!
Who the fuck is that?

814
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:48,156
Well...

815
01:01:49,327 --> 01:01:52,399
These automats go crazy from time to time.

816
01:01:52,847 --> 01:01:56,442
Names and results appear,
and then disappear...

817
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:59,682
The initials of previous players appear.

818
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:00,956
It's probably some kind of virus.

819
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:03,318
Probably in your ass!

820
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,523
Let me tell you something young man....

821
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:08,121
This is a crazy day...
Fuck...

822
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:09,686
What?

823
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:12,560
Yes, a crazy day....

824
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:14,525
In my time, we kept the list of results manually.

825
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:17,521
Everything had to be noted down.

826
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:20,240
It should be the same in bowling.

827
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:21,806
The person who took care of it

828
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:24,286
was specifically hired for this.

829
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:28,000
A man of flesh and blood.
No machine there.

830
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:32,842
Automation has displaced everything.

831
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:36,159
But people...

832
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,684
People are the same all the time.

833
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:42,598
Same crap as always.

834
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:51,205
Automated machines will never solve this problem.

835
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:54,603
So let's go back to my theory...

836
01:02:59,047 --> 01:02:59,957
Which one says?

837
01:03:00,687 --> 01:03:01,915
Which says...

838
01:03:03,607 --> 01:03:06,917
That some things must
remain the responsibility of adults.

839
01:03:09,607 --> 01:03:11,120
What the fuck are you talking about?

840
01:03:11,447 --> 01:03:17,443
In any case, Joey went
to fix your machine.

841
01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:19,996
You've got to be kidding, boy!

842
01:03:20,407 --> 01:03:22,716
Only authorized persons can enter there.

843
01:03:22,887 --> 01:03:23,876
This is dangerous!

844
01:03:24,407 --> 01:03:27,160
You don't give a damn about all the consequences!

845
01:03:27,327 --> 01:03:29,602
And you, old man, don't give a damn,
Whether your machines are running smoothly!

846
01:03:31,927 --> 01:03:34,441
You don't even have to read.
You have it all in the picture.

847
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:36,281
DOES NOT WORK!
Take it!

848
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,641
What should I do about it?

849
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:40,844
Hang it on the track.

850
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:43,680
And on a waxing machine.

851
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:46,281
Your buddies must have messed something up.

852
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,120
I don't want any more
bullets get damaged.

853
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:52,761
And how much will you pay me for it?

854
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:54,121
What the fuck are you thinking?

855
01:03:55,287 --> 01:03:57,305
I don't give a damn about you!

856
01:04:05,727 --> 01:04:07,399
Damn the leg!

857
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:10,001
Damn!

858
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:15,243
What's up?

859
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:17,925
What a brothel this is!

860
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:19,556
Fuck!

861
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:22,966
The chains!

862
01:04:23,207 --> 01:04:24,686
What kind of a brothel is this?

863
01:04:24,847 --> 01:04:27,600
Why would anyone lock us in here?

864
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:31,120
What a load of crap!

865
01:04:52,407 --> 01:04:54,363
What took you so long?

866
01:04:58,087 --> 01:04:59,361
I like this mask.

867
01:05:01,887 --> 01:05:03,764
I didn't know you had it.

868
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:12,037
Will you wear it while napping?

869
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:17,279
Do you have an eraser?

870
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:32,326
How do you want to do it?

871
01:05:37,127 --> 01:05:38,924
Do you like it that way?

872
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:40,236
Because I do.

873
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:48,358
Put it in!

874
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:54,447
Insert very deep!

875
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:05,125
Fuck me!

876
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,680
I'll get there soon!

877
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:14,839
Come on, I can't wait!

878
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:48,437
Julia!

879
01:07:49,207 --> 01:07:51,163
Julia...

880
01:07:51,607 --> 01:07:52,596
Her shoe...

881
01:07:53,927 --> 01:07:58,239
I see you left your shoes here....

882
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,996
Your dress...

883
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:03,966
Handbag...

884
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:06,641
And the other shoe.

885
01:08:16,727 --> 01:08:20,083
Why do you have to cause
so much trouble, Julia?

886
01:08:20,247 --> 01:08:21,475
I just wanted to help.

887
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,246
You scared the hell out of me.

888
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:05,886
"Waxomat.

889
01:09:06,127 --> 01:09:09,358
That's what the old jerk was talking about.
"Polish your bullet."

890
01:09:09,727 --> 01:09:12,321
Do not touch. Hot wax.

891
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:15,126
Hot wax, fuck.
People are morons after all!

892
01:09:15,287 --> 01:09:18,916
Do not touch the machine with your hands or clothes.

893
01:09:19,407 --> 01:09:23,116
Not surprisingly, it scratched the ball.

894
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,922
"Insert coin."

895
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:30,079
Fuck!

896
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:38,596
"Press the button."
"Hot wax."

897
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:42,118
Holy shit!

898
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:44,403
Do you think it's funny!

899
01:09:48,007 --> 01:09:51,204
It is known that the ball will be scratched!

900
01:09:52,247 --> 01:09:55,125
Act, act!
Act!

901
01:10:10,847 --> 01:10:12,200
"Polishing.

902
01:10:22,607 --> 01:10:24,598
"Glossing."

903
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,877
"A guy in a shirt like that must be a fag."

904
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:50,325
God.

905
01:10:52,607 --> 01:10:54,757
Don't be afraid of him, have at him!

906
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:58,877
No, I would be surprised if
he was able to kick someone with that leg.

907
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:01,758
Kurwa....

908
01:11:07,447 --> 01:11:08,436
Hey!

909
01:11:08,687 --> 01:11:10,166
What the hell is going on here?

910
01:11:10,327 --> 01:11:11,965
I think that's clear, no?

911
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,526
You're getting a pushback!

912
01:11:14,087 --> 01:11:16,237
Take a look at the result, you shithead!

913
01:11:16,407 --> 01:11:17,965
There's that BBK again!

914
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:21,244
The door is locked!
What is it supposed to be?

915
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:23,036
Really?

916
01:11:23,287 --> 01:11:26,484
Probably the carpenter closed for a while, Steve.

917
01:11:26,647 --> 01:11:28,922
Watch and admire, silly bitch!

918
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:30,640
My whores are gone!

919
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:33,719
Everyone else has also gone somewhere.
And I don't even have my beer!

920
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,242
And who the hell is that BBK!

921
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:38,046
Tell me!

922
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:41,046
Steve is right.
That what?

923
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:43,965
Ben, Sam and Dave have disappeared.

924
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:48,326
Lisa is constantly going somewhere.

925
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:53,360
And his buddies have also abandoned the sinking ship.

926
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,683
Maybe they are out there.

927
01:11:57,007 --> 01:11:59,726
Tell the burly man to open the door.

928
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:03,682
People don't disappear like that,
after all, this is a bowling alley!

929
01:12:04,327 --> 01:12:05,806
There is an explanation.

930
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:09,403
Grandpa definitely has the keys.
I'm going to go see!

931
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:12,445
Where are you going?

932
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:15,480
Joey can return at any time.

933
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,399
It is necessary to find carpenters.

934
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:24,639
I'm going back there and get it done like a man!

935
01:12:25,327 --> 01:12:26,396
The debacles!

936
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:29,639
So it can be said,
That BBK won the game, eh?

937
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:37,166
Screw this game, screw the BBK
And the whole fucking bowling alley!

938
01:12:37,327 --> 01:12:38,316
Damn!

939
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:39,681
Sucker!

940
01:12:40,887 --> 01:12:42,479
We were the only ones left.

941
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,077
You and me?

942
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:48,436
And he.

943
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:52,319
As Steve said.
Screw B.B.K.

944
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:53,796
Let's play!

945
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:16,436
Fuck!

946
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:19,996
Joey!

947
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:28,000
Where are you?

948
01:13:31,567 --> 01:13:33,603
Joey, what the hell are you doing!

949
01:13:33,767 --> 01:13:35,359
Where are you?

950
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:39,879
What is going on here!

951
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:44,919
Joey, what the fuck are you doing, pervert!

952
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:47,045
Hide that dick!

953
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:50,597
Jesus Christ!
What is it supposed to be?

954
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,725
You are disgusting.

955
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:55,798
What's the matter with you?

956
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,357
Joey, fuck... What's in your head?

957
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:02,684
I knew something was wrong here!

958
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:05,323
Fuck!

959
01:14:09,527 --> 01:14:10,801
Hey, jerk!

960
01:14:11,207 --> 01:14:14,677
Did you fucking do that?
You tore my buddy's head off?

961
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:16,678
Sukinysnu!

962
01:14:19,407 --> 01:14:20,396
Fuck!

963
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:23,716
Take off that mask, asshole!

964
01:14:24,287 --> 01:14:28,565
I want to see the mouth, which in a moment
I will turn into a pulp!

965
01:14:28,727 --> 01:14:30,718
Who the hell are you?

966
01:14:31,727 --> 01:14:33,365
Did you do it?

967
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,119
I'll kill you, you bastard!

968
01:14:39,527 --> 01:14:40,516
Kurwa....

969
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:43,725
Give back the damn bowling pin....

970
01:14:56,447 --> 01:14:59,837
Is that all you can afford?

971
01:15:02,887 --> 01:15:03,876
Fuck...

972
01:15:18,527 --> 01:15:23,157
I'll kill you, motherfucker....

973
01:15:31,047 --> 01:15:33,686
What do you do?

974
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,483
Fucked up faggot...

975
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,522
Fucked up faggot...

976
01:16:07,527 --> 01:16:09,404
You're going to kill me.

977
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,802
I don't give a damn...

978
01:16:32,647 --> 01:16:34,683
I don't give a fuck....

979
01:16:43,167 --> 01:16:44,646
Kill me...

980
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:47,046
Next...

981
01:17:09,047 --> 01:17:10,036
Did you see?

982
01:17:10,447 --> 01:17:13,484
Good, huh?

983
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:15,764
Please, you were lucky.

984
01:17:17,127 --> 01:17:18,924
I want to see it again.

985
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,203
This see.

986
01:17:21,567 --> 01:17:22,886
Coming.

987
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,684
Where do you get the ball?

988
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:35,164
It's stuck there.

989
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:39,318
Do you have the little flashlight that
I gave you once that you don't use?

990
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:43,196
On a key ring?
I use it sometimes.

991
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:48,041
This guy must be in shape.

992
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:53,400
I can see something there.

993
01:17:54,687 --> 01:17:55,676
What is it?

994
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:57,436
I don't know, but...

995
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,002
Looks like.

996
01:18:00,207 --> 01:18:01,959
Like what?

997
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:10,716
Like an ass.
That wasn't funny!

998
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:15,885
Jamie, you have blood on your hand.

999
01:18:16,047 --> 01:18:19,278
Jamie, you're bleeding.

1000
01:18:30,687 --> 01:18:32,678
It's Joey!

1001
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:35,360
What is...

1002
01:18:36,527 --> 01:18:38,438
Jamie, we have to get out of here!

1003
01:18:38,607 --> 01:18:40,484
Look, they're all gone!

1004
01:18:41,447 --> 01:18:42,436
Or they are dead!

1005
01:18:42,887 --> 01:18:43,797
Let's go.

1006
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:52,365
Come on Sarah, let's get out of here!

1007
01:18:58,647 --> 01:18:59,966
It's Patrick!

1008
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:02,561
He looks like a damn Patrick!

1009
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:04,001
Open that door!

1010
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:05,156
I'm trying!

1011
01:19:05,927 --> 01:19:07,360
What the fuck is this?

1012
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:11,999
Come on!

1013
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:15,836
What?

1014
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:19,198
It's plexiglass, it won't shatter.

1015
01:19:19,367 --> 01:19:21,005
Here is another option.

1016
01:19:21,327 --> 01:19:22,123
Come on, Sarah!

1017
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:27,876
Hail!

1018
01:19:28,567 --> 01:19:31,525
That damn Steve was right!

1019
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:36,799
Try to open.
I'm trying!

1020
01:19:36,967 --> 01:19:38,798
Harder!

1021
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:40,363
Not a twitch!

1022
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:42,961
Take it easy, Sarah.

1023
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:44,685
We will find a way out.

1024
01:20:07,087 --> 01:20:08,076
Damn!

1025
01:20:08,527 --> 01:20:10,245
Here is another door.

1026
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:11,756
Let's go!

1027
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:17,516
Come on!

1028
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:19,838
Whichever of them must be open!

1029
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:24,876
Fuck!

1030
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:28,078
We have to go back down.

1031
01:20:43,967 --> 01:20:46,276
Come on, Sarah.
After all, I'm going.

1032
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:47,756
Damn!

1033
01:20:57,007 --> 01:20:57,883
Fuck!

1034
01:20:58,047 --> 01:20:59,799
Fuck, fuck!

1035
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:14,561
It was Steve.

1036
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:16,395
He deserved it!

1037
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,477
Call the police from your cell phone.

1038
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:25,637
It is discharged, otherwise
I would have done it a long time ago.

1039
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:28,725
Typical!

1040
01:21:38,087 --> 01:21:39,076
Ben?

1041
01:21:39,567 --> 01:21:40,556
Dave?

1042
01:21:41,487 --> 01:21:42,476
What is it?

1043
01:21:49,647 --> 01:21:51,319
What's going on here!

1044
01:21:51,487 --> 01:21:52,476
They should not...

1045
01:21:54,927 --> 01:21:56,918
They shouldn't be dead!

1046
01:21:59,967 --> 01:22:02,276
I'm coming down, Sarah!

1047
01:22:11,567 --> 01:22:12,556
Cindy!

1048
01:22:12,807 --> 01:22:14,559
Cindy!

1049
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:16,558
Cindy! Wake up!

1050
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:20,076
Cindy!

1051
01:22:21,887 --> 01:22:23,445
Why are they all dead?

1052
01:22:25,527 --> 01:22:26,516
Sam?

1053
01:22:28,967 --> 01:22:29,956
Sam!

1054
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:31,760
Sam, the guy with the vagina!

1055
01:22:37,487 --> 01:22:38,476
Oh no...

1056
01:22:40,367 --> 01:22:42,437
They screwed up his face!

1057
01:22:44,687 --> 01:22:47,326
We're not getting out of here, Jamie!

1058
01:22:47,567 --> 01:22:49,876
We must!

1059
01:22:54,527 --> 01:22:56,677
You won't get out of here!

1060
01:22:56,967 --> 01:22:59,242
Are you the one who killed all those people?

1061
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,920
Jamie, what's going on?

1062
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:03,599
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.....

1063
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:05,685
Be a good boy and go from there.

1064
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:07,838
You know how it works...

1065
01:23:08,007 --> 01:23:10,202
She saw me.

1066
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:11,197
This is plain murder!

1067
01:23:11,807 --> 01:23:14,401
I'm telling you to go!

1068
01:23:14,687 --> 01:23:15,676
Please!

1069
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:20,236
Dad?

1070
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:22,996
Dad!

1071
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:26,317
Damn!
What have you done?

1072
01:23:26,607 --> 01:23:27,642
Lisa!

1073
01:23:27,807 --> 01:23:30,037
Lisa, what the fuck is going on here?

1074
01:23:30,807 --> 01:23:32,525
I got them, girl....

1075
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,384
I got them all, baby!

1076
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:36,585
But dad, they were my friends!

1077
01:23:36,647 --> 01:23:37,675
Friends?

1078
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,725
And where were they last night, Lisa?

1079
01:23:41,047 --> 01:23:42,036
They weren't.

1080
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:49,277
I'll tell you how it was.
They let those guys over there rape you! In groups!

1081
01:23:49,447 --> 01:23:51,517
Everyone is to blame!

1082
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:54,480
We have already talked about this.
You pissed me off, man!

1083
01:23:54,647 --> 01:23:55,636
I...

1084
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:57,998
I'm screwed, boy!

1085
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,680
I've had enough of this!

1086
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:05,646
Let the little bitch go from here!

1087
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:09,243
Or you'll get a blowjob too!

1088
01:24:09,927 --> 01:24:13,078
Lisa, stop your father.
The plan was completely different.

1089
01:24:13,247 --> 01:24:14,316
The plan?

1090
01:24:14,487 --> 01:24:19,038
Jamie, what the fuck are you talking about?
I want to get out of here!

1091
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:22,120
Lisa was assaulted.
They raped me!

1092
01:24:22,287 --> 01:24:23,959
I found out about it.

1093
01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:25,355
She told me everything!

1094
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,040
So you knew all about it!

1095
01:24:27,207 --> 01:24:30,438
Now it's not important anymore!

1096
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:33,899
Remember about Lisa's story,
That she never met her father?

1097
01:24:34,087 --> 01:24:37,045
He is: BBK.

1098
01:24:37,967 --> 01:24:39,446
BBK?

1099
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,279
Bowling Bag Killer.

1100
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:42,596
Bingo!

1101
01:24:42,967 --> 01:24:44,798
Why is Lisa in an evening gown?

1102
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:48,238
When I found out what happened to Lisa,
I wanted to kill that son of a bitch Steve!

1103
01:24:48,407 --> 01:24:50,875
But...
I came up with an idea...

1104
01:24:51,047 --> 01:24:53,356
I wanted to take revenge in a different way,
with the help of a bowling pin.

1105
01:24:53,647 --> 01:24:56,286
And on those other miscreants!

1106
01:24:56,527 --> 01:24:58,199
What are you talking about?
What bowling pin?

1107
01:24:58,367 --> 01:25:00,961
We raped Steve with a bowling pin!

1108
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:03,641
He mewled like a real pig!

1109
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:09,365
We killed him.
Him and his buddies!

1110
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:22,520
I needed a helper for that!

1111
01:25:22,687 --> 01:25:25,247
Did you think I would have figured it all out on my own?

1112
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:29,045
Someone who would know what to do.

1113
01:25:36,127 --> 01:25:39,039
He was one of them.

1114
01:25:39,207 --> 01:25:42,199
Lisa, I tried to stop Steve, didn't I?

1115
01:25:42,367 --> 01:25:44,517
I tried, but he wouldn't listen to me!

1116
01:25:44,927 --> 01:25:46,565
They wouldn't listen to me!

1117
01:25:46,727 --> 01:25:49,764
Honey, it was Pat who called me yesterday.

1118
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:53,877
He confessed everything to me.

1119
01:25:54,887 --> 01:25:57,924
He wanted to go to the police.

1120
01:25:58,847 --> 01:26:00,439
But I didn't let him!

1121
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:01,917
Why?

1122
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:03,640
I came up with another plan.

1123
01:26:03,847 --> 01:26:05,280
Lisa.

1124
01:26:05,447 --> 01:26:07,802
I swear I wanted to do something.

1125
01:26:08,807 --> 01:26:10,763
Lisa, I love you.
I have always loved...

1126
01:26:10,927 --> 01:26:12,599
I didn't want all this to happen.

1127
01:26:13,047 --> 01:26:15,356
I killed AJ and Joey to redeem myself.

1128
01:26:15,607 --> 01:26:19,122
The police would not be able to...
How could you let him live?

1129
01:26:19,287 --> 01:26:23,166
And include him in your plan?
He raped me with a bowling pin!

1130
01:26:23,327 --> 01:26:24,316
Hold.

1131
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:27,122
Honey, I needed someone to help me.

1132
01:26:27,647 --> 01:26:28,636
For us.

1133
01:26:29,647 --> 01:26:31,239
I don't need it anymore.

1134
01:26:32,207 --> 01:26:34,004
We did quite well.

1135
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,045
You have blood stains on your collar.
What and where.

1136
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:41,599
On the shirt, scowling!

1137
01:26:41,767 --> 01:26:44,486
And just try to say you don't have one!

1138
01:26:49,727 --> 01:26:55,120
He got what he deserved!

1139
01:26:55,407 --> 01:26:58,524
This is not funny!
Do you think this is some kind of joke?

1140
01:26:58,687 --> 01:26:59,836
You are sick!

1141
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:03,556
You're the funny one, my strawberry cake!

1142
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:13,803
Did you really think I would let you go,
after what you did to my child?

1143
01:27:15,927 --> 01:27:18,316
I love you... Lisa...

1144
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:21,045
Step back!
Or I'll shoot you too!

1145
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:27,077
Why do you want to defend this cunt?

1146
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:32,641
You're a bitch!

1147
01:27:35,447 --> 01:27:36,766
Let me go!

1148
01:27:40,087 --> 01:27:41,645
Let go!

1149
01:27:44,327 --> 01:27:48,240
I'll kill you for what you did to her at the ball!

1150
01:27:53,687 --> 01:27:56,326
You're the one they should rape, bitch!

1151
01:27:57,767 --> 01:28:03,637
Do you think I don't know that
have a taste for Jamie?

1152
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:10,596
I'll kill you for that.

1153
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:12,485
Damn pervert!

1154
01:28:12,847 --> 01:28:14,724
She wanted it!

1155
01:28:15,967 --> 01:28:17,605
Bitch!

1156
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:38,080
Right in the face, grandpa!

1157
01:28:38,927 --> 01:28:41,725
Let me go, bitch!

1158
01:28:44,287 --> 01:28:45,276
Let go!

1159
01:28:51,407 --> 01:28:52,396
Dad?

1160
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:54,320
Calm down!

1161
01:28:54,487 --> 01:28:55,476
Dad?

1162
01:28:58,047 --> 01:28:59,162
Dad?

1163
01:29:01,487 --> 01:29:04,047
He planned to kill me from the very beginning!

1164
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:06,845
I had to do it, Lisa!

1165
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,520
Wait for me!

1166
01:29:55,767 --> 01:29:56,756
Fuck!

1167
01:29:57,367 --> 01:29:59,642
Blood everywhere!

1168
01:30:00,327 --> 01:30:01,885
Did you see that?

1169
01:30:02,847 --> 01:30:04,883
How did I blow his head off?

1170
01:30:06,487 --> 01:30:07,920
Fucking carpenter...

1171
01:30:08,847 --> 01:30:11,202
Lisa's father.
I didn't know they were going to act in threes.

1172
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:14,723
I thought he was going to kill them himself.

1173
01:30:16,047 --> 01:30:20,245
It was supposed to be Steve, Joey and AJ....

1174
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:22,723
And he wanted to get me too!

1175
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:26,446
You have to understand that, Sarah!

1176
01:30:26,607 --> 01:30:28,598
I didn't know that they would kill others.

1177
01:30:53,287 --> 01:30:54,845
I told you, Sarah.

1178
01:30:55,647 --> 01:30:57,842
Getting out is not a problem.

1179
01:30:58,807 --> 01:31:01,275
Incomplete...

1180
01:31:01,767 --> 01:31:03,405
You should listen to me.

1181
01:31:07,247 --> 01:31:10,159
That's because I'm always right!

1182
01:31:11,927 --> 01:31:13,121
Let it...

1183
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:20,206
Put it down, Sara.

1184
01:31:20,367 --> 01:31:22,278
You are already safe.

1185
01:31:22,767 --> 01:31:25,486
Don't point that at me.

1186
01:31:27,527 --> 01:31:28,926
Aim for the ground, Sara.

1187
01:31:30,127 --> 01:31:31,446
What's up?

1188
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:33,439
What do you want?

1189
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:39,082
These types should die!
Put it down.

1190
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:42,666
Like I said...

1191
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,666
Screw you both!
