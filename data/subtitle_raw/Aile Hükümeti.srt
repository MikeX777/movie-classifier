1
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,559
What are you doing, Ido?

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,479
Spelling "Nazli".
It's the name of my beloved.

3
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,359
Boys!

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
The teacher is coming.
Put it back in your pants.

5
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,960
I haven't finished spelling it.

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,759
What's going on? Come here.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,131
How many times do I have to tell you
not to come here?

8
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:55,682
This place is dangerous, but here you are.

9
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,119
But we've never fallen.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,920
And they wrote a "U" here.

11
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,079
It's not a "U", it's an "N".

12
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,200
The first letter in his beloved's name.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
Go on, we're leaving.
I'll take you to your homes.

14
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,000
How many times do I have to tell you?
This place is dangerous.

15
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,840
Do you know what would happen
if you fell from there?

16
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,760
You'd be gone.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,400
I'll tell your mother about this.

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,840
Zeyno!

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,719
Yes, Dad?

20
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,760
I've given your hand in marriage
to your cousin Kasim.

21
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,519
Idiot.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,079
Idiot!

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,319
They're taking you away tomorrow.

24
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,359
Dad, he is like a brother to me.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,400
For heaven's sake!

26
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,719
Look, I'm your father. You'll do as I say.

27
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,719
Go on. Go back home!

28
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,039
Roll the dice.

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
-It's not your turn to play.
-It's not?

30
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,479
Good God!

31
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,280
Shit!

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,759
Let's see what your mothers think.

33
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,400
What have you done?

34
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,639
Not much. I'm just chilling.
What have you done?

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,680
The boys were near the cliffs, again.

36
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,360
Damn it!
Didn't I tell you not to go there?

37
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,319
Why did you do that?
Your clothes are covered in dirt again!

38
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,719
Do I look like a washing machine to you?

39
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,840
Sister Kibar.

40
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,919
Seriously, that place is really dangerous.
Please be careful.

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,199
Dangerous?

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
These kids don't care
about danger, Teacher.

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,919
It took three delivery nurses
to deliver this one.

44
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,719
See, he is still in one piece.

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,599
What's going on, sister?

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,800
These brats of yours
went to the cliffs again.

47
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,960
-Oh?
-Yes, I caught them.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
-It's so dangerous.
-Dangerous?

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
These kids don't care about danger.

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,759
Hey! Do I look like
a washing machine to you?

51
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,400
Okay, that's enough.

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,599
There will be a meeting
at the school today.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,719
-Okay, I'll bring the second wife with me.
-Sister…

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,520
-"Second wife" is politically incorrect.
-So what?

55
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,240
-Say "partner". It's more polite.
-Please.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,879
Have a good day.

57
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,800
-Get in!
-Go on! Get in there!

58
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,639
Come on!

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,919
Here we are.

60
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,519
You said it'd be closer to the village.

61
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,879
The village is just beyond that hill.

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,279
Is there a bridge?
How am I supposed to get across?

63
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,480
-There is a bridge.
-But it's collapsed.

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
That's true.

65
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,759
When they built the bridge, they said
it would bring freedom, peace, and unity.

66
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,399
-But that didn't happen.
-What are you on about?

67
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,240
How am I supposed to get across?

68
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,040
Go back to the town,
find someone with a car and come back.

69
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,199
Come back?

70
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,439
-Are you messing with me?
-I'm just kidding.

71
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,399
I'll deliver my cargo
and then I'll take you to Teacher Salih.

72
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,279
Come on!

73
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,160
If you're going to try
to educate us again, I don't want to.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,839
What's the point of teaching us
to read and write?

75
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,439
No, it's not about that.
Take a seat and we'll begin.

76
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,800
-No, they're fine.
-We barely have enough room here.

77
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,439
-I'm talking to the women, Brother Zulfo.
-So?

78
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,560
Don't tire yourself out, Teacher. Really.

79
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,759
We're used to it.
You'll get used to it too.

80
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,519
-When will we get our food supplies?
-What are you doing here, Chief?

81
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,920
You don't have any kids.
Who told you to come?

82
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,560
The classroom belongs to the state.
It's not your property.

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,319
What is in the box, Teacher?

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,199
We've received some shoes for the kids,
thanks to the city.

85
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,560
-What do the kids need shoes for?
-What about us?

86
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,800
-These won't fit me.
-They're for the kids. Just sit down!

87
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,079
At the beginning of the year,
I called you all for a meeting,

88
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,480
but none of you came.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,040
So I had to lie about the supplies.
I'm sorry about that.

90
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,319
Don't apologize, Teacher.
They're too dumb to get it.

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,439
There are some problems with the kids.

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,319
Idris, for example.

93
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,639
You always talk about their kids.
Talk a little bit about mine too.

94
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,240
Your kid is smart.

95
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,920
He is just having trouble focusing.

96
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,800
How come?

97
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,480
-How many kids do you have?
-How many kids do I have?

98
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,000
To keep a long story short,
the kids are all lagging behind.

99
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,279
Well, do something about it then.

100
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,959
Mine probably takes after his mom.
Her family isn't very bright.

101
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,839
Well, he is my uncle's son.

102
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Right, and there is that issue.

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,560
Marriages within the same families
are problematic. We need to talk about it.

104
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,319
It's really problematic.
You can't beat them, can't curse at them!

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,319
They're relatives after all.

106
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,879
Does anyone have a shoehorn?

107
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,759
-There is the bell.
-Get up.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,759
-Let's go.
-Where are you going?

109
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
Fits like a glove.

110
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,199
Well, Teacher, I…

111
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,199
Well, let me take these and…

112
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,279
give them to needy people in the village.

113
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,079
Go ahead, Chief.

114
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,800
I'd just take them back anyway.

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,959
-Chief?
-Yes?

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,959
Where are you taking the shoes?

117
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,079
-They're for the kids!
-Well…

118
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,279
You see, these shoes
are designed for city streets.

119
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,399
It's so rocky here.
It would be a shame to waste these shoes.

120
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
You know?

121
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,879
"The man said, 'Some love stories
aren't meant to be finished.'"

122
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,639
"'It wasn't likely to happen,
and it didn't,' replied the woman."

123
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,480
"It was a complete disappointment."

124
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,840
"And then they caught each other's eye,
possibly for the last time."

125
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,000
OATH OF LOVE

126
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,399
-What's wrong?
-So did they break up?

127
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,759
It's just a story, Zeynep.

128
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,840
What if our story ends like that?

129
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,519
Our story?

130
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,279
Don't we have a story?

131
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes. Of course we have a story.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,080
We've had a story since the day you came
and took a book from me.

133
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,559
Zeynep?

134
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
OATH OF LOVE

135
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,759
-Have you finished it?
-I have not.

136
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,679
Why? You seemed to enjoy it
when I was reading it to you.

137
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,639
I believed it when you were reading it,
but it isn't real.

138
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,159
Don't give me any more books, Teacher.

139
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,759
Why?

140
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Because then I'll believe.

141
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,360
Then I'll believe that love exists
and I'll start to dream.

142
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,799
Love does exist.

143
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,799
Not for me.
There is only pain for me.

144
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,440
My dad has given me to Kasim.

145
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,200
My cousin.

146
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,200
But what about us?

147
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,759
There is no us.

148
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,240
Goodbye, Teacher Salih.

149
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,519
Goodbye.

150
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,559
Goodbye?

151
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,840
What do I do now?

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,720
FROM SALIH OZTURK
TO THE MINISTRY OF FAMILY, ANKARA

153
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,600
"To the Republic of Turkey's
Ministry of Family,

154
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,440
I've been working as a teacher
in the village of Elaldi for three years."

155
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,720
"This is the 38th letter
I have sent to the ministry."

156
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,559
"I have reported what happened
in the village after the collapse

157
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,720
of the Freedom and Equality Bridge."

158
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,639
"The people here are so cut off
from the outside world."

159
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,559
"Since the bridge's collapse,

160
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,960
the villagers have resorted to
marrying their cousins."

161
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,960
"And these types of marriages
cause problems,

162
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,720
not just for the families,
but also for the kids."

163
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,240
"I would like the Ministry
to do something about this."

164
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,360
"I kindly request
that you take the necessary action."

165
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,120
"Teacher Salih Ozturk."

166
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,159
Hello, Chief.

167
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh, hi. How can I help you?

168
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Is this the food from the supply boxes?

169
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,120
No, it's not.

170
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,120
I swear to God, I gave them to the poor.

171
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,440
-Can you please send this letter ASAP?
-Oh, another letter.

172
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,000
Of course.

173
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,600
Let me see if it smells nice.

174
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,679
Teacher, you know…

175
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,919
you keep writing these letters
to your beloved…

176
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,440
but she never responds, does she?

177
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,440
Just accept it.

178
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
She doesn't love you back.

179
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,960
She does not.

180
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,360
ELALDI VILLAGE
MARKET

181
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
It's not a girl, it's the state.
And it dislikes us, not just me.

182
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,360
DOSTLAR CAFE

183
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
See, there's the teacher.

184
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,360
The one sitting over there,
with a gloomy face.

185
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,879
Go!

186
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,320
-Salih Ozturk?
-Yes, that's me.

187
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,559
I came from Ankara.
I'm from the Ministry. We need to talk.

188
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,720
Welcome.

189
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,799
Please, have a seat.

190
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,559
Brother Hasan, we have a guest
from Ankara. Get us some tea.

191
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,360
There is no tea.

192
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,840
-He said "Ankara".
-Let's go before something bad happens.

193
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,320
You already know what it's about.

194
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,399
You wrote 37 letters.

195
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,679
-Yes, I did.
-Bravo.

196
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,679
The Ministry of Family has been working
on a project for years

197
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,440
to strengthen family values.

198
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
To increase the number
of official marriages.

199
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,200
To solve domestic issues
involving wives and children.

200
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,240
To stop consanguineous marriages.

201
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,720
If the project is successful,
we'll apply it on a national level.

202
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,360
That is the project.

203
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,440
Would the villagers accept it?

204
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,000
Villagers! A man from Ankara
has set foot in Elaldi Village,

205
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,200
and he has something important
to tell all of you.

206
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,920
So, everyone, please gather
at the village square.

207
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,799
-Someone from Ankara is here.
-Damn!

208
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,240
From Ankara? Who is he?

209
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,480
How'd he get here?
Did you see him? Who told you?

210
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Just go away.

211
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,079
-Help the kids get dressed.
-Which kids?

212
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,759
Yours or mine?

213
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,160
Well, my kids are so little.
I'll help them get dressed.

214
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,720
Don't look at me like that.

215
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
You said it'd be nice
to bring your cousin in.

216
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,039
What can I do?

217
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,039
I thought she would help with the chores,
but she is so dumb. Your mom was right.

218
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,160
She foresaw all this.

219
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,559
-I heard everything.
-So? Help the kids get dressed.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,440
Where is my pink turban?

221
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,200
We have a guest from Ankara.
I should look elegant.

222
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,640
It's not about you.
The men will take care of it.

223
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,000
-I should go and see what it's about.
-I have to see it too.

224
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,960
I'll kill myself to see him if necessary.

225
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,480
Why is an official from Ankara here?

226
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,480
We probably messed up big time.

227
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
-What will he say?
-Well, it's obvious.

228
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,119
"Don't do it again,"
or something like that.

229
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,960
Do you see any women here?

230
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,279
Hello, boys.

231
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,839
Good God…

232
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,960
Come on, Zulfo.

233
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,759
-Hello.
-What's going on?

234
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,440
-Hi.
-Hi.

235
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,480
-He came from Ankara?
-What is this about?

236
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,759
They say the man came from Ankara.

237
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,960
Why did he come now,
after all these years?

238
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
Here comes your guy.

239
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,839
-He'll make you happy.
-Do you believe that?

240
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,319
No, even I don't.

241
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,720
Teacher! How come the mighty Ankara
could only send one man?

242
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,039
Were you expecting
an army with tanks and planes?

243
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,720
No worries.
The important thing is that he is here.

244
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,759
I've been to Ankara more than once.

245
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,759
Mr. Muzaffer will start talking when
the chief and Brother Cezmi stop talking.

246
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,119
-Teacher! It was Zulfikar's fault.
-What?

247
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,400
Dear people of Elaldi Village,

248
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,279
I'm going to talk to you about
the Ministry of Family's latest project.

249
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,440
The Ministry sent me here
to apply some changes

250
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,119
in accordance with
the Ministry of Family's new project.

251
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,920
I guess they will shit on us
in accordance with the new rules.

252
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,039
This village has been selected
as the project's pilot region.

253
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,960
-What is he saying?
-He says they need pilots.

254
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,480
Planes are so complicated.
I can only drive tractors.

255
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,079
Shut up and just listen.

256
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,480
As you all know, there are still
marriages between cousins

257
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,359
and illegitimate children
are being born every day in this country.

258
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,319
To prevent this from happening,
we will be conducting mass weddings.

259
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,000
Ankara!

260
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,759
These marriages will be for those
who are not related to each other.

261
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,079
Those who are not related? Who?

262
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,720
Who isn't a relative?

263
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,039
-Hey, Ankara?
-I'm listening.

264
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,480
Dear Ankara, are we supposed
to marry non-relatives

265
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,599
and bring strangers into our homes?

266
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,880
My wife is my uncle's daughter.
What am I going to do?

267
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,640
Those who already have kids
will also have weddings,

268
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,759
it doesn't matter
if they are related or not.

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,039
The project concerns future marriages.

270
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,319
Sir, whose idea was this?

271
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
The Minister of Family.

272
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,720
-The Minister of Family?
-Yes.

273
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,200
Well, I can minister my own family.

274
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, I'm already officially married.
I've wasted my time here.

275
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,400
I thought Ankara would have
something important to say.

276
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,039
Bringing strangers into our homes?

277
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,559
Shame.

278
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,880
Bringing a stranger into my house?

279
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,599
I don't get it.

280
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,559
Those who meet the criteria

281
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
will receive the title deeds
for the lands on which they farm,

282
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,200
and for the houses in which they live.

283
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,599
What, title deeds?

284
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,759
Hypocrites.

285
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,960
What does Ankara say? Explain it again.

286
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,880
Just like you heard,

287
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,000
if you get married under these criteria,
you'll receive the title deeds.

288
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,720
Those who are not related

289
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,039
and those who want
to have an official wedding,

290
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,400
please give your IDs to Teacher Salih
to begin the application process.

291
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,359
Come on. Where are our IDs?

292
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,319
-At home.
-Let's go and get them.

293
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,160
They'll give us title deeds
and those will help with the weddings.

294
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,839
If you'll excuse me,
I'll take the children to the school.

295
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,079
Come on, kids!

296
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,000
We're going to the school. Come on.

297
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,039
Do I have to get married
to an ugly woman from the village?

298
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
Right. Because you're too cool for that.

299
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,440
What if I want to go to Ankara
and get married there?

300
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,359
-Also, title deeds.
-Yes.

301
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,599
If they have their own title deeds,
they won't come and work on our land.

302
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,920
It will be the end of us.

303
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,599
I was going to buy all the land
during the elections.

304
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,839
-Seriously?
-Yes.

305
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,000
-I had the politicians in my pocket.
-Sure.

306
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,720
It doesn't matter.

307
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,759
They are all relatives here. Officially,
they are suitable for each other.

308
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,680
Yes, but…

309
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,559
It's hard for the young men
of the village.

310
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,039
Some of them aren't even related,
but they don't know that.

311
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,240
Let's not reveal the truth.

312
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,559
But there are kids! God!

313
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,720
They will get married,
even if they are related.

314
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,400
-These weddings must be stopped.
-Let's think about it.

315
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,279
We've been through so much,
we'll figure something out.

316
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,039
Come on, girls! Come and help us!

317
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,799
We are here.

318
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,359
Give it to me.

319
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,720
-Careful with your back.
-My back is really killing me.

320
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,799
-Easy.
-Right.

321
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,599
-Come on.
-Give it to me, Mom.

322
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,799
Hold it. Right, put it on there.

323
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,640
-Right.
-We've found it.

324
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,599
Mom…

325
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,200
Mom, I remember the hair.

326
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,279
It's mine. I'll give it to you
as a wedding present.

327
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,240
So that you can remember me when I'm dead.

328
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,079
Of course, my sweet mother.

329
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,799
-Don't say things like that.
-You're upsetting the girls.

330
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,880
-Right!
-Are these the ones?

331
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,519
Right. Here are the IDs
for Kehribar, Seyhan, Dad, and me.

332
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,680
Mom, what the hell?

333
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,480
-What?
-It says your surname is "Yazgulu".

334
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,599
Yes. That'd be me.

335
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,079
Yazgulu?

336
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:07,960
-What kind of a surname is that?
-A slutty surname.

337
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,440
No, come on. It's really beautiful.

338
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,480
When my dad went
to get my identification card,

339
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,400
the officer told him,
"My girlfriend's name is Yazgulu."

340
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,359
"Do you like it?" And my dad said no.

341
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,880
So he said no.

342
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,480
But my dad was illiterate,
he couldn't read the surname.

343
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,359
So it's a gift from a civil servant.

344
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,920
Give it here.

345
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,640
It really is "Yazgulu".

346
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,480
Well, it's so beautiful.

347
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Ado! Stick with the plan.

348
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,799
She is the one who takes care
of your special needs.

349
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,000
Come on. Let's not keep Ankara waiting.

350
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,079
-Come on!
-Okay, we'll handle this.

351
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,839
-Leave it, Mom.
-Come on.

352
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,799
I can't think of any solutions.

353
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,319
And the guy mentioned a pilot.

354
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,759
As if there are
any planes in the village.

355
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,799
Still with that pilot nonsense?

356
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,200
Sister, what did you mean when you said,
"She takes care of your special needs."

357
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,559
Am I a whore?

358
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
No, not a whore. You're a bitch.

359
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,440
Go on.

360
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,960
"Will Osman come to the school?"

361
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,079
This is how you build a question sentence,
using "will" at the beginning.

362
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,279
Or you can start the sentence
with "where", "when", "how"

363
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,359
to ask a question.

364
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,440
All right, let's see. Ask us a question.

365
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,319
-The relatives can't marry each other?
-"Can't the relatives marry each other?"

366
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,119
Question mark.

367
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,359
"Can't they…" Okay?
You there, ask us a question.

368
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,200
Marrying makes them relatives,
or doesn't it?

369
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,839
It does. No, it doesn't.

370
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,319
This isn't working.
You're confusing me, kids.

371
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,799
Hello.

372
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,640
I've brought the IDs.

373
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,200
I'm in the middle of a lesson.
We'll handle it later.

374
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,440
-Okay?
-Oh, right.

375
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,440
Get the fuck out, all of you!

376
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,559
-Dad!
-Shut the fuck up and get out!

377
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,519
Go on!

378
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,960
Early break.

379
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,079
Don't go too far,
I'll invite you back in in a second, okay?

380
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,839
-Go on.
-Come on.

381
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,359
Here they are.

382
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
But there are three ID cards here.

383
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,000
There are three of us here.

384
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,960
But this won't work, Brother Adil.

385
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,880
You can't marry two women.

386
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
But I already have.

387
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,759
I mean, you can't
officially be married to both of them.

388
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,200
Teacher! Here are the IDs.

389
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,799
Do us a favor.

390
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,599
I have classes to attend to.
The kids will be back shortly.

391
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,119
Don't worry about it.
I told them to go back to their homes.

392
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,079
-Whose IDs are these?
-Mine, hers, and my brother Cevat's.

393
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,839
I'll help him get married too.

394
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
But aren't they related?

395
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,240
-Come on, do us a favor.
-I can't.

396
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,519
Mr. Muzaffer has all the details
about your family trees.

397
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,720
-I can't.
-Stop!

398
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,519
Cancel all the weddings!

399
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,680
Jeez…

400
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,920
Damn, Chief.

401
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,279
I just wanted to come and see
who is marrying who.

402
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,519
Let me see.

403
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,799
They can't marry each other.
They are relatives.

404
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,680
Don't worry about it.

405
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,960
I'll find a suitable wife
for your brother.

406
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,759
No. This is getting out of hand.

407
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,839
It'd be best to gather all the villagers
and talk about this.

408
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,079
-Sister!
-What is it?

409
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,559
All the men have gotten together.

410
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
-They're choosing wives for themselves.
-What?

411
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,880
Is Cevat there too?

412
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,359
What is the meaning of this?

413
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,000
-I'll explain if you give me some donuts.
-Little brat. Just spit it out.

414
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,279
Spit it out!

415
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,880
They mentioned some family tree.

416
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,160
-All right.
-And they'll choose suitable wives.

417
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,599
I'm not really sure.

418
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,319
How long do we have to wait?

419
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,839
I'm making the final adjustments.
I'll tell you shortly.

420
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,119
Thank God.

421
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,200
Okay…

422
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,759
Here are the names of those
who are not each other's relatives.

423
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,200
Sir, how do you know about our families?

424
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,920
The family trees. Sit down.

425
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,240
Even I have only just realized
that me and my wife are relatives.

426
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,799
Yes, Mahmut?

427
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,039
Brother Salih, what is this?

428
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,640
Mahmut, here are the names
of those who are not related to you,

429
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,920
those who can get married to you.

430
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,880
I understand that, but why is
"Melike" next to my name?

431
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,160
Because Melike is the only girl
you're not related to.

432
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,119
What about me?

433
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,640
Well, all right.
Let me read out the entire list.

434
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,440
Kasim and Gulsum.

435
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,200
God bless you, Teacher.

436
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,759
Israfil and Diyar.

437
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,119
-Cevat and Bedevi.
-Bedevi?

438
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,680
Sit the fuck down!

439
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,519
Wait.

440
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,799
What about me?

441
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,000
Murat and Seyhan.

442
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
-Murat?
-Damn!

443
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,359
-Teacher! What about me?
-Huseyin.

444
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,680
There are no
suitable women for you in this village.

445
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,039
-How come?
-The whole village is related to you.

446
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,160
Yes, Huseyin.
Unfortunately, you don't have a match.

447
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:41,240
-There's nobody.
-God damn it.

448
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,119
Well…

449
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,559
Thank you all.

450
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,200
Thanks to you,
I've become one of the village's boys.

451
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,160
I'm not related to anyone,
so I'll write my name down.

452
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,640
Whoa!

453
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,359
Is that possible?

454
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Teacher, you are not one of the villagers.

455
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,400
Let's get these people married first,
then we can talk about the rest.

456
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,400
-Right, Mr. Muzaffer?
-Sure.

457
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,319
Yes.

458
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,000
What happened, Cezmi?
What does the state say?

459
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,759
-Come on.
-Who is marrying who?

460
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,680
-Shut up.
-Tell me, Cezmi.

461
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:34,880
Cezmi…

462
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,839
Zeyno…

463
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,759
I can't marry you to your cousin Kasim.

464
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,640
The deal is off.

465
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,920
Who is my match, Dad?

466
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,559
Murat, Asim's son.

467
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,720
-Murat?
-Yeah, Murat.

468
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,039
It's the will of the state, dear. So what?

469
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,960
I'll be at the café.

470
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,880
Mom, tell Dad that I will never
marry that disgusting Murat.

471
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Tell him yourself, if you have the guts.
I didn't want to marry your dad either.

472
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Okay. Then Kehribar can say that to Dad.
Dad won't argue with her.

473
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,480
No, I'm not available.

474
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,960
Why wouldn't he argue with her?
Is her pussy made of gold?

475
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,519
-Shut up! I'll go talk to your dad.
-Go on, Mom.

476
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,599
No, I don't have the guts either.

477
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,319
So I have some information.

478
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,240
They say official marriage is important.

479
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,279
The one you marry will get
the title deeds when you're gone.

480
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,279
Just come here.

481
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,079
-Come over here.
-Stop it.

482
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,000
But I'll come over if you marry me.

483
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,359
My Kehribar, come on.
We can talk about it later.

484
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,599
I have something to do here.

485
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,239
-What are you doing?
-I said I had something to do.

486
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,039
It doesn't matter to me.
It can be even better.

487
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,000
You, come here.
And you, come over to this side.

488
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,639
Whoa, Ado! Hold your horses.

489
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,840
Come on! We need to talk.

490
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I know what you want to talk about.

491
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,280
But Ado and I have already agreed.
He is going to marry me.

492
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,840
What? You know…

493
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,079
-Is that right, Ado?
-Well, I just said…

494
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,840
-I mean, it's just--
-I deserve to get married.

495
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,599
I am older. To hell with this slut.

496
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,880
If you don't marry me,
I won't give you any of my corn fields.

497
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,760
You won't get anything, Ado.

498
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,360
For God's sake, Kibar.
What are you talking about?

499
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,840
Are you listening to yourself, Kibar?

500
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,239
A woman has to give
everything she has to her husband.

501
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,159
Well, then the one you marry
should give you what she owns.

502
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,360
Because I swear to God, I won't!
You won't get anything from me.

503
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,880
I won't either.

504
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,840
Make a choice, Ado.

505
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,639
Her fields?

506
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,079
Or my fields?

507
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
ID

508
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,440
What kind of fuckery is this?
These ID cards are not correct.

509
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,599
It says I'm 18 years old and you are 72.

510
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,760
I've been using my dead aunt's ID.
What can I do?

511
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,639
Just go to sleep.

512
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:50,840
So they are going to marry
the ones on that list?

513
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,679
-Yes.
-Then what?

514
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,039
-Then they will get the title deeds.
-And then?

515
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,199
They'll have the title deeds.

516
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,639
What the…

517
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,480
Fucking peasants.

518
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,519
-Kismet.
-Yes?

519
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,920
If that happens, they won't work
on our fields anymore.

520
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,599
They won't work for us.

521
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,840
Do everything you can
and solve this problem.

522
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,119
How can I do that?

523
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,559
-Talk to the women.
-About what?

524
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,559
-Tell them not to get married.
-Sure. Anything else?

525
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,880
Well, tell them marriage is a bad thing.

526
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,960
Not for me.

527
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,960
That's what you're going to tell them.

528
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,400
Kismet, please.

529
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,920
Make it happen.
Persuade them not to get married.

530
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,360
What if they reject it?

531
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:47,320
You'll find a way.
You are the smartest woman of them all.

532
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, everyone knows that.

533
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,000
-Then go and see Kibar in the morning.
-No, I can't.

534
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,039
-Why?
-Her house stinks.

535
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,599
-Good God!
-Yeah.

536
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,159
Kismet…

537
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,119
if you do this for me,
I'll buy you a golden bracelet.

538
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,920
Not good enough.

539
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,480
-Two bracelets?
-Not enough.

540
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,559
Fuck me, what else do you want,
you greedy woman?

541
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,679
-I want a phone.
-What?

542
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,079
Why would you want a phone?

543
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,679
All of your relatives live nearby.
If you farted, they'd hear you.

544
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,519
But I would be the only one with a phone.

545
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,800
Okay, fine.

546
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,800
I'll buy two phones for you.

547
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,880
You can hold the second one
next to your ass and talk to it.

548
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,519
In that case, I will destroy
all the potential marriages.

549
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,079
What the hell? Azime is my match.

550
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,239
Dayibasi?

551
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,559
-Speak of the devil and she shall appear.
-Huh?

552
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,800
What's up, Azime? What do you want?

553
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,480
My dad said I was your match.

554
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,519
-Yes. And?
-Huh?

555
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,280
So?

556
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,760
He said, "Don't bring that dog
into my home. Go to him and…"

557
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,719
"And talk to him about marriage."

558
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,960
Azime, I don't want to get married.
I want to build a career for myself.

559
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Huh?

560
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,119
Azime, go back home. Go.

561
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,480
Turn around!

562
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,679
Just keep walking in that direction. Go!

563
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,960
Get out!

564
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,239
God damn it!
What kind of a project is this?

565
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm not used to sitting on the ground.

566
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,239
My backside doesn't like it.

567
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,199
Did you wash your hands, Azime?

568
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,440
The dough seems clean.

569
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,760
Look, sipping tea,
but there's no side dishes.

570
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,280
Can I get you some sugar candy?

571
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,039
-There is no candy.
-Yes, there's some in the kitchen.

572
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,599
That's for our guests.

573
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,360
Am I not a guest?

574
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,519
You rarely come here.
Why are you here now?

575
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,239
I was just passing by with Cemile
and we decided to pay a visit. Right?

576
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,920
No. You came to me,
grabbed me and brought me here.

577
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,840
Dayibasi kind of rejected me.

578
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,800
Don't worry. All these men are alike.
They are all evil.

579
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:49,719
My husband, for example,
he forgets our wedding anniversary.

580
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,320
He forgets my birthday.
He doesn't care anymore.

581
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,079
I have had enough!
I'm going to get a divorce.

582
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,079
-Damn!
-Divorce? Has he got a second wife?

583
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:01,840
-How can you say that, sister?
-Well, it is what it is.

584
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,079
Say "partner", it's more polite.

585
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,639
No. He didn't get himself a second wife,
it's just that he isn't romantic.

586
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,239
-What?
-He isn't romantic.

587
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,679
You know, I paid a visit
to my aunt in Ankara and--

588
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,840
They say that's a lie.

589
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,159
That she was home with the curtains drawn,
pretending she had gone to Ankara.

590
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,639
Who says that?

591
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,119
They are probably just haters
who are jealous of me.

592
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,079
Anyway…

593
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,199
I went to Ankara.
Then I went to a movie theater.

594
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:43,639
It was huge, just like my home.

595
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,199
A grand, flamboyant interior.

596
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:49,000
In that movie, the man
asked the woman to marry him.

597
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,719
But the way he asked…

598
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,079
And Dayibasi called me "the devil".

599
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,679
The man was lying on the floor.

600
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,760
Ado was also lying on the floor yesterday.

601
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,519
No, not like that.

602
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,360
The man was on his knee,
his other knee was facing forward,

603
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,199
and he bowed before the woman.

604
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,760
-Like this.
-In that position?

605
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,159
Not really.

606
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,599
But he bought a fancy ring for the woman,
with a huge diamond on it.

607
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,960
-Damn…
-And he says, "Will you marry me?"

608
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,599
Asking her a question.

609
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,119
-Asking who?
-The woman.

610
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,320
Why? He should be asking
the woman's father.

611
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,800
Movies are so fake.

612
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,239
Not really. That is what
the men in Ankara are really like.

613
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,599
They say "dear", "baby",
"honey" to the women there.

614
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
They say, "I love you."

615
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,559
It's so different there.

616
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,559
Right…

617
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,760
-Sister.
-What's up?

618
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,480
-Tell you what.
-What?

619
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,079
I don't want to marry Israfil.

620
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,880
-What is wrong with Israfil?
-I love Mahmut.

621
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,960
-That can't happen.
-Why not?

622
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,519
-He's not on the list.
-So the list gets to decide, not me?

623
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,320
That's the will of Ankara.
We can't object to it.

624
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,800
I don't want him. I don't love him.
Why can't you understand?

625
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,440
You don't have to love him.
You'll get used to him.

626
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,719
You'll be his partner. You'll collaborate,
but you will get used to him.

627
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,760
At some point you might even
want to see him dead.

628
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,199
Sometimes you will hate him,
but you will get used to him anyway.

629
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,599
It doesn't matter if you love him or not.
Marriage is like shopping.

630
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,000
Give and take. Give and take.

631
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,199
Take more, give less. You see?

632
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,800
Now, get up. It's time to cook.

633
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,880
We'll go to Cemile's house
to prepare the food.

634
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,679
-Mom, I'm hungry.
-You little brat, just move.

635
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,039
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

636
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,880
Brother Suleyman,
I could use some cold water here.

637
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,159
Go and get it yourself.

638
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,599
I'm in a tough spot.

639
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,880
Who isn't?

640
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,960
No, I don't get it.

641
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,840
Seyhan's grandmother and my aunt
are somehow related.

642
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,400
But that doesn't make us relatives.

643
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,000
Cousins, nieces, those are relatives.

644
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,599
-You know?
-Well said.

645
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:35,440
It's a distant relation.
I don't understand how we are related.

646
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,119
We are not relatives, just acquaintances.

647
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,320
Well, at least you have a match.

648
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,800
Damn you, Dad.
Why did you marry one of our relatives?

649
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,800
I wonder if we can officially reject
my mom as a relative.

650
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,199
She's a pain in the ass anyway.

651
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,719
-Is that possible?
-I don't know.

652
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:55,960
Right.

653
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,400
What are you looking at, bro?
It's not like I burnt your field down.

654
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,079
You burnt my heart down with your match.

655
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,840
Well, people get what they deserve, huh?

656
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,440
What the fuck is that?

657
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:12,280
You didn't say anything
when you were matched with Melike.

658
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,280
-Were you interested in her?
-You have a point.

659
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,559
-Shut up, Israfil.
-Why?

660
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,320
-What happens if I don't?
-Let the real men speak.

661
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,559
People who don't respect
other's lovers aren't real men.

662
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:27,199
And you're a real man? Is that it?

663
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,880
That's right.

664
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,400
-Watch your mouth.
-Put that hand down.

665
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,920
I hope one of them gets killed,
so that I can have one of the girls.

666
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,800
What are you doing, Seyhan?
The dough is gone.

667
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,599
Always blaming others, right?
What about you?

668
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,719
-Seyhan, look here.
-So what?

669
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,320
-Just leave it.
-My hand!

670
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,800
People get what they deserve, eventually.

671
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,119
Oh, do you like to see me suffer?

672
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,320
-Yeah, I love it.
-Is that right?

673
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,960
That's right.

674
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,440
Come on. Taste my pain then.

675
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,639
-Leave it!
-You…

676
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,880
-Stop it!
-Don't!

677
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
What the hell?

678
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Let her go!

679
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,480
Guys! What the hell are you doing?

680
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,239
Guys!

681
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,840
What is going on here? Stop it!

682
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,320
Fuck it, Teacher.
Let me smash his face in.

683
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,440
I'll make him pay
for taking an interest in my lover.

684
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,519
-Calm down.
-I didn't do that!

685
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:33,360
I've loved Bedevi since childhood.
I want her.

686
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,480
To hell with those title deeds
and weddings!

687
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,679
Brother Orhan, you're the oldest one here.
Why didn't you do something?

688
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,880
I'm not in the mood.

689
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,599
What's their problem anyway?

690
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,599
It's about the weddings.

691
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:06,440
Uncle Orhan, do you have
a problem with your hearing?

692
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,760
And he smiles.

693
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:12,079
This guy…

694
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,800
-Stop it!
-Let her go!

695
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,519
Leave her be! Stop it!

696
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:18,519
What's your problem? What the hell?

697
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,480
-What is going on?
-Mom!

698
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:22,920
Let that slut explain it!

699
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,400
Watch your mouth, Melike!

700
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,079
Come to your senses!

701
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,639
-Don't take an interest in others' lovers!
-I don't!

702
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,039
I wasn't matched with my lover either!
Let go! Back off!

703
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,440
To hell with title deeds and weddings!
Let go of me!

704
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,800
Damn you all! I'll end up killing myself!

705
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,119
Nobody wants this,
so stop upsetting each other.

706
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,480
Upset? What do you mean, Zeynep?

707
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,039
-We're all crying rivers here.
-Just shut up.

708
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:53,280
My mom wants to see you.

709
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,039
Mr. Muzaffer!

710
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,039
What are you doing here?

711
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,079
Come here, Teacher Salih.

712
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,679
I wanted to look around,
but there is not much to see.

713
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,679
Yeah, it's a small place.

714
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,960
"Yeah"? Your language is deteriorating.

715
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,079
It doesn't deteriorate,
Mr. Muzaffer, it just changes.

716
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,119
The key thing is to understand each other.

717
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,360
-If it wasn't, what would a mute do?
-You are right.

718
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,000
-The bridge is gone.
-Yes.

719
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,280
It was not safe,
so the state had to demolish it.

720
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,719
But they didn't build a new one.

721
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,760
Teacher! Teacher Salih!

722
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,599
Boys, what is it?

723
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,360
I told you not to come up here again.

724
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,639
-What's going on?
-My dad wants to see you tomorrow.

725
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:49,239
Yes, I know.

726
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,400
He said, "That asshole
had better remember."

727
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,519
-Asshole?
-That's what he said.

728
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,119
All right, okay.

729
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:03,920
Let's go, Mr. Muzaffer.

730
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,519
Go back home.

731
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,000
-Dad didn't say "asshole".
-No, that was me.

732
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,440
Zeynep?

733
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,440
I'll wait for you over there, Salih.

734
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,719
Look at him. That evil bastard.

735
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:46,199
-Why would you say that?
-This is all because of him.

736
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,239
Everyone is upset.
Nobody is with the one they love.

737
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,599
What about you? Are you upset?

738
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,519
I feel sad for my sister and friends.

739
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,320
Aren't you?

740
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,960
Anyway, I'll go get the kids.

741
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,599
Hey! I told you not to come here.

742
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
What the hell are you doing here again?

743
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,400
Let's go.

744
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,519
-Who is her match?
-Whose match?

745
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,199
I don't know who you mean.

746
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:27,280
We will wait and see, I guess.

747
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,760
Well, shall we?

748
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:51,199
The earth would shatter
If I told you how I felt

749
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:57,079
What can I do about it?
My beloved is in the wind

750
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,000
Ankara's project
Took my beloved away

751
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:08,840
They have a list
And we're promised title deeds

752
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:23,159
I'll marry you and you.

753
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,440
Okay.

754
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,480
What can I do?

755
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:32,519
I'll just go out and find another woman.

756
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,039
Did you hear him, sister?

757
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,280
Don't worry.

758
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,679
Nobody wants to fuck an old goat.

759
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,519
Well, okay.

760
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:52,599
I'll buy you whatever you want.

761
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,119
Damn it.

762
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,199
As far as I've heard,

763
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:00,119
they sweet-talk women in Ankara
and ask them questions like,

764
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,599
-"Will you marry me?"
-What the…

765
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,880
Stop talking nonsense
in front of the girl.

766
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,559
We can talk about it in the bedroom,
if that's what you want.

767
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,320
No. In Ankara men go down
on their knees and ask them,

768
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,119
"Will you marry me?"

769
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,320
What the hell is your problem?
On my knees? How could I do that?

770
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,920
That's what the man in the movie did.

771
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,679
Enough. Are you going to marry me or not?

772
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:31,000
I will marry you if you sweet-talk to me.

773
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,840
Like…
what was I wearing when we first met?

774
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:39,039
A bridal gown.

775
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:42,440
Right. That was easy.

776
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,320
Then sweet-talk me.

777
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,199
Like…

778
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,559
call me baby.

779
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,239
Call me honey.

780
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,320
Call me sweetheart.

781
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,360
Call me your bunny.

782
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,760
Call me your lover.

783
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,880
Call me honey.

784
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:03,880
"Honey"?

785
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,920
-"My lover"?
-That's right.

786
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,760
-Do you want to hear those nice words?
-Yes, I do.

787
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:17,840
I'll fucking… God damn it.

788
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,559
God bless you.

789
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,079
God bless these weddings.

790
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,159
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

791
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,079
Let me hear some music!

792
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,800
Come here, baby
Don't you know that I love you?

793
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,480
I want to hug you tight
What would I do without you?

794
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,599
Take my breath away
It's ready for you

795
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,079
Don't you cry, wipe away your tears
I'd die for you

796
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,000
Take my breath away
It's ready for you

797
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:46,400
Don't you cry, wipe away your tears
I'd die for you

798
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:51,639
The music should go higher, Mr. Drummer

799
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,320
The girl loves that guy
Why would she care about the world?

800
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,239
The music should go higher, Mr. Drummer

801
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:06,039
The girl loves that guy
Why would she care about the world?

802
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,119
The music should go higher, Mr. Drummer…

803
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:11,360
Mr. Muzaffer.

804
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,559
I need to do something.
I'll be back in a moment.

805
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:16,840
Excuse me.

806
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,519
The music should go higher, Mr. Drummer

807
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,400
The girl loves that guy
Why would she care about the world?

808
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,119
The music should go higher, Mr. Drummer

809
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,800
The girl loves that guy
Why would she care about the world?

810
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,800
The music should go higher, Mr. Drummer

811
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,320
The girl loves that guy
Why would she care about the world?

812
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,679
Giving it to people in need, huh?

813
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,360
Cutting up shoes? What the hell?

814
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:20,800
Damn it! Again?

815
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,239
Hello, God.

816
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,159
I'm the chief of Elaldi Village,
my name is Dayibasi.

817
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,400
I swear that I won't sell
any haram goods anymore. I promise.

818
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,639
But you should also do something
about those thieves.

819
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,159
Hasan, get me a Turkish coffee, please.

820
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,400
-I said a "Turkish coffee".
-Just drink your tea.

821
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,280
God damn…

822
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,400
Boys! I thought you were brave men.

823
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:18,920
I would never marry my friend's lover,
even if they promised me all this land,

824
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,440
not just a couple of title deeds.

825
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,840
I would though.

826
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:26,079
God.

827
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:28,679
Stop talking nonsense, Brother Cezmi.

828
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,400
Don't make me smash your face in.

829
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,159
Look, fat boy. That's what I say.

830
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:36,639
Don't smash my face in.
Go and smash your lover's dad's face.

831
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,239
Take your lover away, get in bed with her,
and then she will have to marry you.

832
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,400
-What a great idea.
-Yeah.

833
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,719
Cezo!

834
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,480
I'd love to see him try that.

835
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:57,320
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I'm just saying.

836
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,960
This is all just a scam by the state.

837
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:03,880
Just think about it.

838
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,920
The state lets us have title deeds
in order to collect taxes,

839
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:09,320
so that you'd have
to pay taxes on it every year.

840
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,239
Otherwise, Ankara wouldn't
give a fuck about it.

841
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,360
Let's not curse.

842
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,719
You know, Brother Cezmi is right.

843
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,920
Boys, Cezmi is never right.
I can tell you that.

844
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,199
Cezo.

845
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,679
I know what troubles you, son.

846
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,400
I'll have my own property.
That scares you, doesn't it?

847
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
No, really. I swear to God.

848
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,320
We're not interested in having property.

849
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:42,000
We just want the ones we love.

850
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,760
Bravo, boys.

851
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,639
Do everything you can to reunite
yourselves with your loved ones.

852
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,639
I just want a woman.

853
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,920
So who is going to marry Ado?

854
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:06,000
-Your mom.
-Huh?

855
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,400
Don't get upset. She just wants to know
who will marry Ado.

856
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,079
That's right. Who will marry him?

857
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:15,960
Your mom!

858
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,800
Ado hasn't said anything about it.
We will see.

859
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,119
I'm officially married
and I regret it every day.

860
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,320
Marriage is the end of love.

861
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:30,360
-We're kind of married anyway.
-This is different.

862
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,559
There is you and there is your husband.
And then comes the state.

863
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,239
So?

864
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,519
She says, "Love is for two.
Who needs the state?"

865
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,880
-Huh?
-Right.

866
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,960
Well, we have a love for three.

867
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,639
If the state wants to join in,
then it'll be for four.

868
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,320
But if Ado finds another woman,
that would make it for five.

869
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,639
If he finds two other women,
that'd make it for six.

870
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,320
Cemile, you're really smart.

871
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,800
-Me?
-Yes, you.

872
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:10,679
You are smart, kind, and emotional, right?

873
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,280
Why would you marry someone
who does not touch your soul?

874
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,159
-Right, he doesn't touch me at all.
-Huh?

875
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,599
I'm telling you,
this woman is being exploited.

876
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,800
Her husband took her in,

877
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,360
but she was never asked
if that was what she wanted.

878
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,880
She would say, "Let me think about it."

879
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,719
And then probably reject him.
Right, Cemile?

880
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
What can I do?

881
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,000
I'll tell you what you can do.

882
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,440
Tell me, Cezmi. What was your plan?

883
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,760
I persuaded Kismet to discourage
the other women from getting married.

884
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,199
-Nice.
-And I chatted with the boys.

885
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,440
I confused them further.

886
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:02,679
"Why would you care about a list
that the state provided you with?"

887
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,840
"Just go and take your lovers," I said.

888
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:07,599
Good job, Cezmi. We're on the right path.

889
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm also in trouble
with that ugly chick, Azime.

890
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,199
-Really?
-Yes, she came to my store.

891
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:16,519
"I want you to have me."
"Take me away," she said.

892
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,159
Why the fuck would I marry her?

893
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,480
There's nothing beautiful
or graceful about her.

894
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,880
She looks like a dinosaur.

895
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:29,079
Chief.

896
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:32,880
You're not Azime's relative.

897
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:34,719
No, I am not.

898
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,519
You know those lands
you'd receive if you married her?

899
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,840
-They are just next to mine.
-So?

900
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,320
If we own all that land
and build a chicken farm there,

901
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:49,800
we could sell those chickens at our store.

902
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:55,599
Cezmi.

903
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,320
I won't sell my soul to the devil
for the sake of a few chickens.

904
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:01,800
-Sorry.
-Damn it.

905
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,599
Love is so precious to me.

906
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,360
Don't even mention that again.

907
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:10,679
Chicken farm…

908
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,400
Here I am trying to
solve the problem of the title deeds,

909
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,079
and here you are asking me
to marry that dinosaur,

910
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,320
sell my soul to the devil,
and set a bad example for the youth.

911
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,679
Is that right, Cezmi?

912
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,280
Cezmi! You don't understand me at all!

913
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,920
Good God! Yeah, right!
As if I was the village bitch!

914
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,519
Shit. He is crazier than I thought.

915
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:44,239
That's not how I pictured it.

916
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,079
-Same here.
-I knew this was going to happen.

917
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,679
I'll end up like my mom.

918
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,559
-I hope I won't kill myself.
-Stop talking nonsense, Seyhan.

919
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,239
We'll find a way, okay?
We will figure something out.

920
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,360
Don't upset yourself.

921
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,559
The bridal gown looks like
a burial shroud on you, Bedevi.

922
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:11,760
Stop saying things like that.

923
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,880
-You are so beautiful.
-And you are smiling.

924
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,880
Well, I'm not going to be a bride,
but I wish you every happiness.

925
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,360
I'm so happy, I can't even describe it.

926
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,800
Sister Seyhan! Brother Cevat
is waiting for you on the hill.

927
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:40,039
Just go and have a chat.

928
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,360
You should go with her, Bedevi.

929
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,000
-Take off that gown.
-Okay.

930
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,679
-Help her.
-Okay. That's enough.

931
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,079
Right. You're also beautiful.
Take off that dress already.

932
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:04,800
Everything will be okay.

933
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,280
Idris.

934
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:35,760
Zeynep?

935
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:38,599
Teacher Salih,
go to the riverbank at once.

936
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,159
Is she mad? What have I done?

937
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:54,119
It's not about you, Mr. Muzaffer.
It's about me.

938
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,519
Sister Bedevi.

939
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,960
I'll be waiting over there.

940
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,119
You're going to marry her,
but you still call her "Sister Bedevi"?

941
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,320
What are you talking about?
My Seyhan, you are…

942
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,280
All of the other girls
are my sisters, except you.

943
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,000
I don't care about what the state says.

944
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:43,320
What have they done to us, Cevat?

945
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,000
-Why have they done this?
-I can't live without you.

946
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:51,199
Zeynep?

947
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,360
Salih.

948
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:00,280
That's the first time
you've called me Salih.

949
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:05,760
Salih…

950
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:08,639
I want you to know something,

951
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,800
just in case my dad
makes me marry someone else.

952
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,960
-Zeynep--
-Hush.

953
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,360
It's already hard enough to say it.

954
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:20,280
Salih…

955
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:24,920
I love you.

956
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,159
I love you too.

957
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,039
I have something to tell you.

958
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:48,519
You've already told me
the best thing you could tell me, Salih.

959
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:49,760
-But--
-Hush.

960
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,599
Don't say it, Salih.

961
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,559
Let "I love you too"
be your final words to me.

962
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:30,000
Say what?

963
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,000
You'll ask my dad
for my hand in marriage.

964
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,920
I'll prepare coffee for you.

965
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:37,000
You'll say, "God knows, I love her."

966
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:40,400
And my dad will say,
"Well, they love each other."

967
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,039
Your dad is dead, Cemile.

968
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:57,159
Good night.

969
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,599
-Hi.
-Hello.

970
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,119
Boys! Do you have room for some guests?

971
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:05,280
Sure, you're always welcome, Teacher.

972
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:06,840
But I am not?

973
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:09,840
-I didn't say that.
-The boys are a little angry.

974
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,679
That's why, Mr. Muzaffer.

975
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,280
Two cups of tea, please.

976
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:15,920
All right, give me a second.

977
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,479
Why are they angry?

978
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,399
Because of Ankara.

979
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Men should be able
to choose their own wives.

980
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,439
Boys, look, I know this
is unorthodox for you,

981
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,199
but everything will be better.

982
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,359
Your kids will be healthier.

983
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,800
-We won't have any kids.
-Why do you say that, Mahmut?

984
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:36,800
We can't touch our friends' lovers.
That's not right.

985
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:39,560
-We won't.
-Really?

986
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,479
She's like a sister to me.
Marriage won't change anything.

987
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,920
My man.

988
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,199
We are different from the people
you are used to, Mr. Muzaffer.

989
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,880
I'm doing the right thing.
You'll see that in time.

990
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,119
So everything else is right, it's just
this situation that's wrong. Is that it?

991
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,399
Nobody is happy.

992
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,359
They'll get used to it, Salih.
Change is hard.

993
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:14,159
It's tough.

994
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,960
It's tough.

995
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:18,800
-Cevo.
-Yeah?

996
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,720
-You won't touch Bedevi, right?
-Good God.

997
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,840
-Your beloved is like a sister to me.
-You are right.

998
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,560
-I have an idea.
-What is it, Mahmut?

999
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,359
Call the girls here.
I'll explain it to everyone.

1000
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,680
Go on.

1001
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:49,800
Ask Kevser for my hand in marriage.

1002
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,000
Ask Kevser?

1003
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,399
I won't fucking marry you. I won't.

1004
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,239
I'll just marry someone else.

1005
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,880
In Ankara, women request dates,
as far as I've heard.

1006
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,800
-What?
-In Ankara, women--

1007
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,000
You already told me that.

1008
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,039
Let's go, Mr. Muzaffer.

1009
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,920
No, I want to listen to him. Tell me.

1010
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,840
I'm curious. How many girls
have asked you out in Ankara?

1011
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,119
None.

1012
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,199
Well, judging from your looks,
I guess that's normal.

1013
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:28,840
-Sorry?
-I mean, that's normal.

1014
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:32,479
-If you don't have any other--
-I do, Teacher.

1015
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,039
I have a problem.
Mr. Minister, please come closer.

1016
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,279
Come and look me in the eyes.

1017
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,680
One of my eyes was green.

1018
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:42,600
I lost so much weight.

1019
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:46,039
-The other lost its color.
-What are you talking about?

1020
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,359
Do you know anyone in Ankara
who might want to marry me?

1021
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,039
-No.
-Huseyin.

1022
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,880
Please, get up.

1023
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,479
I'd better go now.

1024
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,359
There are a lot of crazy people
in this village.

1025
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:10,680
There are, unfortunately.

1026
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,640
Why is this happening, Grandmother?

1027
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,279
Love is lived a little differently here,
my lovely girl.

1028
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,199
But I can't live without my beloved.

1029
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,880
Of course you can.

1030
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,479
How would you know what it means
to be without your beloved?

1031
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:38,520
I do know.

1032
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,119
When a girl gets in bed
with someone she doesn't love…

1033
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,359
even the man's mustache bothers the girl.

1034
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,199
Everything bothers her.

1035
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,399
Around here, we don't really get
to marry the ones we love.

1036
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,000
Your mom didn't want
to marry your dad either.

1037
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,439
"I'll kill myself," she said.

1038
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,439
But she didn't.

1039
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:15,560
Your grandfather approved the marriage
and we couldn't say anything.

1040
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,880
Your mom cried rivers,
but she married him.

1041
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,119
And then you girls came into the world.

1042
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,880
Cevat?

1043
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,920
Cevat!

1044
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:03,239
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

1045
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,800
-What's going on?
-What?

1046
01:13:07,479 --> 01:13:08,960
Wait. We'll be right there.

1047
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,479
Seyhan.

1048
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,920
I need to get food from the store,
but I'm scared. Come with me.

1049
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:27,560
Just leave me be, Zeynep.
Can't you see I'm in pain?

1050
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,159
I'm telling you, I'm scared. Come with me!

1051
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,680
-Just take someone else with you.
-Get up, Seyhan!

1052
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,439
Go on, Seyhan. Get up.

1053
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,319
Stop it. Come on.

1054
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,199
Cevat is waiting.

1055
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,800
-Where?
-Move it.

1056
01:13:58,119 --> 01:13:59,279
Zeynep.

1057
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,640
Evening.

1058
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:05,319
Evening.

1059
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,279
Look at me.

1060
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,920
If you're planning
to take the girls away--

1061
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,279
Take them away? No.

1062
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,479
Where would we take them to?
How could we take them away?

1063
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:18,920
Okay, that's fine.

1064
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,119
Tell me then. Why are you here?

1065
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,720
Fine, okay. I get it.

1066
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,720
I'll be waiting right there.
But make it quick, okay?

1067
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,199
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1068
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,920
So, guys, if they want to separate us
just to collect some title deeds

1069
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,439
then we need a plan.

1070
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,119
-Right.
-Of course.

1071
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,399
I don't get it.
Seyhan and I can't be relatives.

1072
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,000
Her grandmother and my auntie--

1073
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,359
-Shut up for God's sake, Cevat.
-God.

1074
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,279
We'll stay married until we get the deeds.
Then we'll get a divorce.

1075
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:01,399
Who keeps the title deeds
when we get divorced?

1076
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:02,760
The man or the woman?

1077
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:04,760
Divorces aren't common here, Bedevi.

1078
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,119
-True.
-It doesn't matter.

1079
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:08,119
From now on, it'll be common.

1080
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:10,880
How does one get a divorce anyway?

1081
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,399
Well, you go…

1082
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,920
I mean, I don't really know.

1083
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:18,720
We'll be reunited with our lovers.
The rest is Ankara's problem.

1084
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,039
Murat is the only one for me.

1085
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:23,680
Don't get ahead of yourself.
What if there are kids?

1086
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,720
I don't really know.

1087
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,800
Anyway, Israfil?

1088
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:42,359
We'll get married, but you'll still
treat me like a sister, right?

1089
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,079
Yes, I swear. You're like a sister to me.

1090
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,279
Besides, I'm in love with someone else.

1091
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,840
-Whatever.
-Let's go.

1092
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:56,479
-Take it easy.
-See you later.

1093
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,800
Have a good night.

1094
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:01,920
Go on!

1095
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:25,319
I just comb my hair, mind my own business

1096
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:31,119
I just want my lover
I'm in flames, day and night

1097
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:37,119
What do I have to be ashamed of?

1098
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:43,159
To hell with Ankara's project
I already have a lover

1099
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,840
Ado will find another woman
and marry her because of you.

1100
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,159
It's because of you. You're younger.

1101
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:03,439
The older one gets to get married.
I'm the older one here.

1102
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,800
I deserve to be married to him.
I always carry Ado's burden.

1103
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:12,359
Mom, run! Deva fell in the oven.

1104
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,600
-The oven was on!
-What?

1105
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,079
Deva!

1106
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:17,520
Deva!

1107
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,199
Deva!

1108
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:21,720
Don't worry! I'm here, my girl!

1109
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:24,079
-Deva!
-Deva!

1110
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:26,840
She is not here.

1111
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,920
Deva!

1112
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:33,079
-She is fine.
-Where have you been, baby?

1113
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:34,920
You're fine, dear.

1114
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,760
She's perfectly fine.
There's nothing wrong with her.

1115
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
You fucking brat! Did you lie?

1116
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,960
-Son of a bastard!
-Bastard!

1117
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,359
Shameless brat.

1118
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:47,359
Come here, baby.

1119
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,880
Thank God, she is fine.

1120
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,119
-Put the cream on.
-Stay still, I'm putting it on.

1121
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,439
Good God!

1122
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:04,199
Have you lost your mind?
Why would you put your hand in the oven?

1123
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,119
Even this kid is smarter than you.

1124
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,640
See, she didn't touch the oven.

1125
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,239
What could I do? I was worried about her.

1126
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,520
Sister, are you in pain?

1127
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:18,439
No, of course not. I love fire.

1128
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,199
Send me to Hell when I die
so I can burn in peace.

1129
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,760
Fire is good, right? Blow on it.

1130
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:27,199
God.

1131
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:29,800
-Sister.
-What?

1132
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,319
You can marry Ado.

1133
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:35,479
Why?

1134
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,920
Sister, your home is my home.
Your fields are my fields.

1135
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:43,479
Your kids are my kids too, dear sister.
We're a family, right?

1136
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,600
Huh?

1137
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:56,479
What now?

1138
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,560
Have you all got it?

1139
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,840
Teacher.

1140
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,079
-I'm working here, Chief.
-That's okay.

1141
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:20,680
Kids don't bother me.

1142
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,640
They are kids, they're fine.
Now, look at me.

1143
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,600
How is the process going?
How did they respond?

1144
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:29,560
Everything is fine. I have their IDs.

1145
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,880
Why?

1146
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:33,960
Why are you even here?

1147
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,920
Oh, right.

1148
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,560
This is the letter you wanted
to send to Ankara.

1149
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,680
I thought Mr. Muzaffer can take it
to Ankara, if he's still here.

1150
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,880
-Has he gone?
-That won't be necessary.

1151
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,159
Sorry for interrupting the lesson,
but it's urgent.

1152
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,920
That's fine.
I already interrupted the lesson.

1153
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:54,760
I'm here to collect the IDs.

1154
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,760
I have some of them here,
but the rest are at my house.

1155
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:03,119
-Okay, bring them here.
-Sure. Let me take the kids home.

1156
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:08,199
No way. That won't be nice for them.
The kids should stay on course here.

1157
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:11,239
I can teach them a few lessons.
I love children.

1158
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,760
Come on, Salih.

1159
01:20:16,039 --> 01:20:17,000
All right, okay.

1160
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,079
You there! Come here at once.

1161
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,119
Take these papers.

1162
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,039
Give some of them to your friends.

1163
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:37,399
So the first lesson
is about folding paper.

1164
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,119
Now, fold that paper like a cup,

1165
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:43,119
so I can put cookies in them
and sell them.

1166
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:44,680
Got it? Then let's begin.

1167
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,560
Get to work. You too.
Give the others some paper.

1168
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,000
Come on! Hurry up, lads.

1169
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:56,199
Damn! Ido, Come here.

1170
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,880
Take this letter to the teacher. Hurry!

1171
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,920
Take this ID and give it to the teacher.

1172
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,279
But this is Kehribar's ID.

1173
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,039
Yes, it is.

1174
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:12,720
She deserves to marry you.

1175
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,199
Poor thing, she's young
and has a lot on her shoulders.

1176
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,720
Your mustache bothers me, but not her.

1177
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,960
Where are you going, Ido?

1178
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:35,800
To find the teacher.

1179
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:39,680
-Okay. What is that?
-Teacher's letter.

1180
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,520
-Where is he?
-He went home.

1181
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,319
Okay, give it to me.
I'll take it to him. You go back to class.

1182
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:49,439
-But don't read it.
-That'd be shameful. Go ahead.

1183
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:56,520
FROM SALIH OZTURK
TO THE MINISTRY OF FAMILY

1184
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,319
"To the Republic of Turkey's
Ministry of Family,

1185
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,720
I've been working as a teacher
in the village of Elaldi for three years."

1186
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:11,680
"This is the 38th letter
I have sent to the Ministry."

1187
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:15,399
"I reported what happened in the village
after the collapse

1188
01:22:15,479 --> 01:22:19,359
of the Freedom and Equality Bridge."

1189
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:25,119
"The people here are so cut off
from the outside world."

1190
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,479
"Since the bridge's collapse,

1191
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,279
the villagers have resorted to
marrying their cousins."

1192
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:33,239
"And these types of marriages
cause problems,

1193
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:36,079
not just for the families,
but also for the kids."

1194
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,319
"I would like the Ministry
to do something about this."

1195
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,720
"I kindly request
that you take the necessary action."

1196
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,960
"Teacher Salih Ozturk."

1197
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:55,600
Teacher Salih!

1198
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:02,399
You did this.

1199
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,680
I did it for you.
I did it so we could be together.

1200
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:13,840
But everybody else is sad.

1201
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:17,479
I didn't know that would happen.

1202
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,359
How can I be happy with you
while there is so much sadness around?

1203
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,359
I can't. We can't be happy.

1204
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:25,279
Not anymore.

1205
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:34,520
What is it, Teacher Salih?

1206
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:39,520
I caused this mess, Mr. Muzaffer.

1207
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,560
We can talk about that later.
We need to get the IDs there at once.

1208
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,239
-Let's go.
-You go ahead.

1209
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:48,439
I don't want to be
part of this mess anymore.

1210
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,600
I don't want to influence
others' lives to get what I want.

1211
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,880
What do you mean?

1212
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,640
I didn't understand them,
yet I wanted them to understand me.

1213
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:08,520
How can someone understand you
when you don't understand them?

1214
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,880
They can't.

1215
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,399
Ankara!

1216
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,840
Mr. Minister!

1217
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:21,479
Mr. Minister.

1218
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:25,840
Minister? I'm just a civil servant.

1219
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:29,279
Mr. Civil Servant, please.

1220
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,800
Let's go to Ankara
to find me a suitable wife.

1221
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,199
You must know suitable candidates.

1222
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,880
I'll pay for the bride, if necessary.

1223
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:40,399
I can also give away three of my sheep.

1224
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:53,039
But the girl doesn't want him.
She says she'll kill herself if needs be.

1225
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,239
You have to do whatever I say.
Girls can't choose their husbands!

1226
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,279
The teacher and that Muzaffer guy
can both go to Hell.

1227
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,720
OATH OF LOVE

1228
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:44,640
Zeynep. Come and take care of me.

1229
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:46,840
Look, I look wonderful.

1230
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,359
You're so beautiful.

1231
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,000
What about me, Zeynep?

1232
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,520
You look so beautiful too.

1233
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:01,600
You're all so beautiful.

1234
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:07,640
I wish things were different.

1235
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,920
But here we are.

1236
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,399
Whatever. Don't fret, Zeynep. It's fate.

1237
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:19,880
Don't worry about us, Zeynep.

1238
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,520
We've already found a solution.
The men promised they won't touch us.

1239
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,119
We will reunite with our lovers
once we get the title deeds and lands.

1240
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Hopefully.

1241
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:32,960
Hopefully.

1242
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:45,239
It's all because of me.

1243
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,840
-What is wrong with Zeynep?
-She's probably worried about us.

1244
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,960
And she is next in line to get married.
Maybe she's afraid.

1245
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,159
Ladies.

1246
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:01,880
Oh, my beautiful girls.

1247
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:03,680
Praise be!

1248
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,039
You look fantastic.

1249
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,640
But the men have tricked you.

1250
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,199
-They wouldn't trick us.
-Shut up. What do you know?

1251
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,920
It's impossible
to marry the ones you love.

1252
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,399
None of your mothers
loved none of your fathers.

1253
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,039
But all of your fathers had their way
with your mothers, obviously.

1254
01:28:27,319 --> 01:28:30,239
I also had to let my lover
be with someone else.

1255
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,319
And I had to let someone else's lover
have his way with me.

1256
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,399
All men are the same.

1257
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:41,159
Of course they will touch you
and have their way with you.

1258
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,359
You will be wasted tonight.

1259
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,840
Have you seen the looks on their faces?
Hello there.

1260
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,880
Look! Look at those brave young men!

1261
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,680
I brought you some liquor, guys.

1262
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,359
I don't know,
maybe it will give you some courage.

1263
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,079
Listen to me.

1264
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:33,640
If you have any questions
about anything, just ask me.

1265
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,199
I'll teach you how to seal the deal.

1266
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:37,880
-I'm about to smash your face in.
-Whoa! Look, fat boy.

1267
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,600
You are all grown up.

1268
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,880
You're about to get married
and you'll have kids soon.

1269
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:45,800
But you still don't have manners.

1270
01:29:46,039 --> 01:29:48,119
Stop fucking with the boys, Cezmi.

1271
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:51,399
In the end, they are marrying
each other's girlfriends.

1272
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,840
You are right. Poor boys. Hey! Good God!

1273
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,760
-Go away before I crack your skull open.
-Come here.

1274
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:00,199
Oh, the mighty fatty!

1275
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,680
-Hit it!
-Come here.

1276
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:09,600
Come here, you dumb-ass!

1277
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,920
Come here. Start dancing with us.

1278
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,640
Salih!

1279
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,279
Where are you going?

1280
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:58,359
-Back where I came from.
-So you're running away, huh?

1281
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,720
Leaving the village and the kids behind
and running away?

1282
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,439
-I screwed everything up.
-Yes, you did.

1283
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:11,640
You're a coward.

1284
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,079
That's why I'm leaving.

1285
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,720
Go!

1286
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,840
Go away, Teacher Salih! Go!

1287
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:11,520
What are you doing, Salih?

1288
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,000
Wait a second!

1289
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,640
Stop!

1290
01:33:21,159 --> 01:33:22,239
What the fuck's going on?

1291
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,640
I'm in love with Zeynep.

1292
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:42,600
I am asking you to give me
her hand in marriage.

1293
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:47,760
-Uncle Ado!
-What?

1294
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:49,520
Come quickly!

1295
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:51,479
-The girls are going to kill themselves!
-What?

1296
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,000
-Where are they?
-The girls?

1297
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:54,640
Where? Where are they? Run!

1298
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:56,600
-Run!
-Run!

1299
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,800
-Run!
-Run!

1300
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,880
Stop!

1301
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,399
Don't come any closer!

1302
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,079
Stop!

1303
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:09,840
Don't come any closer or we'll jump!

1304
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,119
-Don't come any closer!
-Stop!

1305
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,399
-Don't come any closer!
-Don't!

1306
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,880
Stop!

1307
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,199
-What are you doing, Bedevi?
-Don't come near me!

1308
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:22,840
What the hell are you doing, Bedevi?

1309
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,199
Don't come any closer!

1310
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,399
Come here, for God's sake!

1311
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,239
Calm down. What is going on?

1312
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:29,520
Are they protesting?

1313
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,720
It's not a protest, Chief!

1314
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:32,520
We are suffering!

1315
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,760
For God's sake, come here!

1316
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,520
What are you doing? Come here!

1317
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,640
We can't do what you want us to do, Dad!

1318
01:34:39,159 --> 01:34:41,359
We don't want to end up like our moms.

1319
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:44,439
We want to marry whoever we want!

1320
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,920
The state can't choose
our husbands for us!

1321
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,079
I'm still available, by the way.

1322
01:34:51,159 --> 01:34:52,199
Seyhan!

1323
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,319
For heaven's sake, Seyhan! Come here!

1324
01:34:55,479 --> 01:34:57,439
Please don't do this, Seyhan. Come here.

1325
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,119
I'm begging you. Come here, Seyhan!
Stop this nonsense.

1326
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,560
I'll kill you if you jump, Diyar!
I swear to God!

1327
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,039
I don't care about title deeds.
She is my daughter, after all.

1328
01:35:06,119 --> 01:35:07,319
You're absolutely right.

1329
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:11,199
How can someone let their children die?

1330
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,960
Shut up, you faggot!

1331
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,159
-What the…
-We've made our decisions, Dad.

1332
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:20,800
-If you don't approve, we'll jump!
-Wait!

1333
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,239
What a dreadful bridge that is!

1334
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:25,520
-We're still suffering because of it!
-Stop!

1335
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:27,479
Stop.

1336
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,039
It's all because of me.

1337
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,560
I wrote the letter to the Ministry.

1338
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,039
I am sorry.

1339
01:35:54,279 --> 01:35:58,640
God damn you, Teacher.
I don't have a woman because of you.

1340
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:02,680
Guys! Enough with
the title deeds and all that.

1341
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:06,680
Put an end to this situation
and let the lovers be reunited. Huh?

1342
01:36:07,479 --> 01:36:08,520
What do you say, Dad?

1343
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:09,760
-What do you say, Dad?
-Right?

1344
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,319
-Let the lovers come together!
-Yeah!

1345
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,039
Right? Come on, Ado.

1346
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,760
-Come on, Ado.
-Come on, Dad.

1347
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:19,479
-Right?
-Right, Dad?

1348
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:22,640
-Just say it's okay.
-Dad?

1349
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,239
Yes, that's right.

1350
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:28,399
-Come on, Ado.
-Come on already.

1351
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,800
Okay. Come here.

1352
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:57,680
Wait a minute!

1353
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,960
Why doesn't anybody in this village
take me seriously?

1354
01:37:03,159 --> 01:37:04,560
I'm also protesting!

1355
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:08,880
If you don't find a woman for me,
I swear I'll throw myself off here.

1356
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:10,960
Huso! Hey!

1357
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:12,880
I'm in a tough spot, Cevo.

1358
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:14,399
Okay, all right.

1359
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,600
Okay, we'll find someone for you.

1360
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,079
And we will rebuild the bridge for you.

1361
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,199
Well, I'm sold.

1362
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:24,159
Goodness gracious!

1363
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,199
"To the Republic of Turkey's
Ministry of Family,

1364
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:55,520
thank you for answering my calls
and choosing us as your pilot area."

1365
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,439
"However, this place isn't ready
to change just yet."

1366
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,319
"Instead of making radical changes,

1367
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:05,359
we made decisions
that could be implemented gradually."

1368
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:08,399
"Removing borders and uniting people,

1369
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,880
adjusting measures
to ensure people's happiness."

1370
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,520
"That's what we did."

1371
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,119
"Teacher Salih Ozturk."

1372
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:29,439
Hello, Chief.

1373
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:33,039
-Well, hello!
-Let's get straight to the point.

1374
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:36,800
Can you please send this to Ankara?

1375
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,319
-Is it another evil plan?
-No, it's not.

1376
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,199
It seems that your bags are empty.

1377
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,600
Unfortunately, they are.
Some faggot probably stole them.

1378
01:38:52,119 --> 01:38:56,279
-Yes. Some faggot.
-Yeah. That's what I said.

1379
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,680
Take it easy.

1380
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,760
Goodbye.

1381
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:04,319
Faggot.

1382
01:39:10,359 --> 01:39:12,640
Look, everyone is gone.

1383
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:15,560
Fucking peasants.

1384
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,920
