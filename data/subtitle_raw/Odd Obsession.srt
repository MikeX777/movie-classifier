5
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,300
Man's senility is believed to
begin at the age of 10.

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Eyes begin to lose their
elasticity at 10.

7
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,230
Ears begin to dull at 20.

8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,550
Man's eyesight begins to
weaken at 40.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,660
His sense of taste becomes
blunt at 50.

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,470
His sense of smell abates at 60.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,420
Then, at 70, he loses two-thirds of
his physical functions.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,680
This theory says a man becomes 12mm
shorter every 20 years.

13
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,840
This theory may not be conclusive.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,630
Yet no one can escape physical 
senility. It is inevitable.

15
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,210
You, too.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,980
This is the interesting case of
a pathetic man

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,670
who attempted to fight senility.

18
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,260
He's not a complete stranger to me.

19
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,370
Well?

20
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,360
Any headaches or ringing 
in the ears?

21
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,690
Nothing of the sort.

22
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,010
Is my blood pressure high?

23
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,240
No. Not too high.

24
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,640
But Dr. Soma says you'd better
stop the injections.

25
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,550
Dr. Soma is a great moralist.

26
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,310
Why don't you try something else
to make you feel young?

27
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,200
You can think of something.

28
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,250
I'm too young to suggest one myself.

29
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,470
I don't know.

30
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,880
What's keeping Dr. Soma?

31
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,990
I'll go find him.

32
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,060
Never mind.

33
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,470
He'll lecture me again.

34
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,200
You can give me a shot.

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,300
If you insist.

36
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,410
Won't you visit us this evening?

37
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,260
I was thinking of it myself.

38
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,400
It's been some weeks since the
last time.

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,010
I got Karusumi from home.

40
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,520
I like Karusumi.

41
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,180
Good.

42
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,850
Kimura, as I've repeatedly told you,

43
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,950
my wife musn't know that I come here.

44
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,010
I don't want to worry her.

45
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,930
I understand.

46
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,160
Did it hurt?

54
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,780
I was in conference and 
couldn't see your husband.

55
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,470
Kimura, you checked his 
blood pressure?

56
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a little higher than last month,

57
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,040
but with him, it's not exactly abnormal.

58
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,260
Tell me, how long has he been 
coming here regularly?

59
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,360
Since...

60
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,010
September of last year.

61
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,180
I didn't know that.

62
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,660
Generally, men will hide it 
from their wives.

63
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,220
What's wrong with him,
if I may ask.

64
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,940
Nothing at all.

65
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,010
Let me explain some things to you.

66
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,080
Sexual desires become

67
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,380
milder by degrees as people grow old.

68
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,380
Was he a very passionate man?

69
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,870
He said his was of an 
artistic nature.

70
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,440
- Artistic?
- He did things...

71
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,290
that embarrassed me.

72
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,030
I suppose he regrets the loss of 
his youthful vigor,

73
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,010
but I can't approve of so 
many injections.

74
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,310
I prescribed a life with less
stimuli of any kind.

75
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,560
A quiet and temperate life.

76
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,800
It's the best kind of life.

77
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,720
I hope he'll be able to live a long
life, and he can with your help.

78
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,590
He's such a valuable man.

79
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,870
He's the foremost authority on
classical art objects.

80
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,170
- He's one of our cultural assets.
- Do me a favor, Doctor.

81
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,950
I learned of his frequent visits here
from my daughter.

82
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,540
But please don't tell him that
I came today.

83
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,370
Should he learn that I know
his secret,

84
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,880
he may worry.

85
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,990
I should think so.

86
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,920
You, too, Kimura.

87
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,290
I know, Ma'am.

88
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,330
I'll pay you a visit tonight with some
karusumi.

89
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Karusumi is delicious.

90
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,280
We haven't seen you in weeks,

91
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,360
Toshiko will be pleased.

92
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,040
Why are you here?
Come in.

93
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,520
I don't want to be seen.

94
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,800
- Why?
- Just because.

95
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,760
I waited for you at the concert.

96
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,000
Gosh, I totally forgot about it.

97
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,770
I had to help Dr. Soma until late.

98
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,710
Was it last night?
Enjoy it?

99
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,360
I waited two hours at the door
for you.

100
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,460
When you didn't come, I left.
I didn't go in.

101
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,970
This is the ticket for it.

102
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,960
Your ticket for it.

103
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,130
Here.

104
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,810
It's useless now, so you may as well
tear it to pieces.

105
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,970
Well, goodbye.

106
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,650
Your mother seemed to suspect that
I'd told you about your father.

107
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,140
Does father come here often
for treatment?

108
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,640
Mother came, too?

109
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,750
Why should we worry?

110
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,950
I'm planning to visit you tonight
with some karasumi.

111
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,490
- But my parents will be home tonight.
- I know.

112
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,170
Let's go to Osaka.
The same place.

113
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,130
No one home?

114
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,790
Where have you been?

115
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,440
Next door, to get some salt.

116
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,670
Salt?

117
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,990
And yesterday, I had to ask
for some flour.

118
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,970
- Madame knows.
- Where is she?

119
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,340
She's out shopping.

120
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,870
When did she leave?

121
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,880
When was it...

122
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,480
Here she is.

123
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,650
I'm sorry I'm late.

124
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,110
What can I do for you?

125
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,270
Didn't you want me?

126
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,750
- Where have you been?
- To Nishiki Street.

127
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,010
What for?

128
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,880
To buy some food.

129
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,280
We had nothing in stock.

130
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,060
Anyone coming?

131
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,310
I hear we have no salt or flour.

132
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,300
Didn't I give you money for 
food yesterday?

133
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,730
I went shopping with that money.

134
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,030
I know you aren't very practical.

135
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,850
I have no regular occupation,

136
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,100
and I've sold my assets.

137
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,310
I know... Even the curios are just
left in your  charge.

138
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,760
I can raise money if we need it,

139
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,720
but I want you to be frugal.

140
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,340
Toshiko!

141
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,660
- I couldn't see you in the dark.
- It's not dark.

142
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,160
It's so bright outside that it
feels dark inside.

143
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,690
You're home early.

144
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,460
The usual hour.

145
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,870
Come here.

146
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,480
What is it?

147
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,990
How are you getting along with
Kimura?

148
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,480
We went to the movies 
some time ago.

149
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,350
You should be seeing more
of him.

150
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,820
I hate Kimura very much.

151
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,800
I hate Kimura.

152
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,110
That's no way to talk to us.

153
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,850
What a nasty girl!

154
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,090
She pays no attention to 
what I want.

155
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,770
She doesn't mean it, I guess.

156
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,610
She takes after you.

157
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,370
You think so?

158
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,830
I think she's quite like you.

159
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,920
You're not very nice today.

160
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,800
- Still angry about last night?
- What do you mean?

161
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,910
You always pretend ignorance.

162
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,600
Certain things are better 
left unsaid.

163
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,590
Spoken like a priest's daughter.

164
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,140
You're so cute.

165
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,310
Who's pussy cat are you?

166
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,540
So you're hungry?

167
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,580
I'll give you some milk.

168
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,170
A cripple!

169
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,600
How ugly!

170
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,620
Go away!

171
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,650
Hello there.

172
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,710
Welcome, stranger.

173
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,620
How have you been?

174
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,480
Fine, thanks.

175
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,060
Come right in.

176
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
It's been a long time.

177
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,160
My husband and I were wondering
what had become of you.

178
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,940
I've neglected visiting you.

179
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,190
- Is Toshiko upstairs?
- Yes.

180
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,160
Do you want me to stay longer?

181
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,230
- No, you can go.
- Good evening.

182
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,870
This is karasumi from home.

183
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,030
Thank you very much.

184
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,200
Wonderful.

185
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,740
Bring some brandy.

186
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,320
- And a knife.
- Ok.

187
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,300
<i>Toshiko! Come downstairs!</i>

188
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,310
<i>Mr. Kimura is here.</i>

189
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,260
I thought you weren't coming.

190
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,760
I couldn't come earlier.

191
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,940
- Good evening.
- Evening. How are you?

192
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,610
How have you been?

193
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,300
- You need a hard surface.
- This will do.

194
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,320
I can't drink.

195
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
You know that, mother.

196
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,270
Oh, that's right.

197
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,390
Let me get that.

198
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,720
You have homework?

199
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,960
She can do it later.

200
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,850
Go ahead, if you must finish
it tonight.

201
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,060
Yes, I'm afraid I have work 
to finish.

202
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,710
That reminds me, I must
do something myself.

203
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,110
Excuse me, I won't be too long.

204
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,880
Finished your work?

205
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,370
What was amusing you?

206
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,030
I told him, "What a funny 
looking fish a karasumi is!"

207
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,730
I said, "It swims this way."

208
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,960
Very funny.

209
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,240
It's just dried mullet roe.

210
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,340
Ovary.

211
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,520
She drinks a little.

212
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,090
I've been training her.

213
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,420
- Is she alright?
- Yes, she's fine.

214
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,790
Have you decided?

215
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,370
To marry Toshiko?

216
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,290
My father is a fisherman.

217
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,360
I don't deserve to be her husband.

218
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,610
- Social status doesn't matter.
- Thank you, sir.

219
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,740
I'm just an intern until 
I get a degree.

220
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,790
Then Dr. Soma wants my service.

221
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,710
I'll speak to him.
Start a practice.

222
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,860
That would be wonderful,

223
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,580
but I need backing.

224
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,560
Would you?

225
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,860
Sure, why not?

226
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,750
Is your wife drunk?

227
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm afraid so.

228
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,760
Toshiko is hard to understand
sometimes.

229
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,140
She's wise.

230
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,090
When someone says a 
girl is bright,

231
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,460
they mean she's homely.

232
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,470
You mistunderstood me.

233
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,670
She doesn't have her mother's
looks,

234
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,670
but they're very much alike.

235
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm very worried about your wife.
I'll go find her.

236
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,470
When she's drunk, she hides in
the bathroom.

237
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,760
Kimura.

238
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,800
Jealousy makes me feel
much younger.

239
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,920
Good method.

240
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,250
But, I don't understand what
you mean.

241
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,440
Really?

242
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,660
It's about time she was back
here.

243
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,720
My wife.

244
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,610
I think I should go find her.

245
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,110
Mrs. Kenmochi.

246
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,150
Mrs. Kenmochi?

247
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,600
Mrs. Kenmochi?

248
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,950
What's wrong?

249
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,990
Ah, Toshiko, it's very strange...

250
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,680
Your mother disappeared.

251
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,680
- Gone to bed?
- Not with you as a guest.

252
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,140
Are you there, Mother?

253
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,570
Mother!
What happened?

254
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,570
Wake up, mother!

255
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,830
Sir! It's terrible.

256
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,640
I'll make her bed.

257
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,700
Come help.

258
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,820
- Should I come in?
- She musn't catch cold.

259
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,820
Wipe her hands.

260
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,700
Her night clothes.

261
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,710
Shall I send for Dr. Kodama?

262
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,190
- Our neighbor.
- Cerebreal anemia, maybe.

263
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,020
You can examine her, right?

264
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,970
Yes, if you'd like.

265
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,330
Cerebreal anemia, yes.

266
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,340
Heat won't help.

267
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,500
I see.

268
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,610
She'll be all right.

269
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,130
She may need a vitamin shot.

270
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,180
You have it here?

271
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,360
I think I have it.

272
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
I'll give it to her.

273
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,040
- Don't bother.
- No need if she's okay.

274
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,960
I see.

275
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,510
Well, I must be leaving now.

276
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,370
Take good care of her.

277
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,760
Thank you.

278
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,700
Kenmochi speaking.

279
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,500
How is the patient?

280
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,200
She seems all right.

281
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,570
But do see her again.

282
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,970
She hasn't woken up yet.

283
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,940
That's strange.

284
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,440
I'll come over as soon as I can.

285
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,870
Who's out there?

286
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,260
Sneaky thief.

287
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,960
That's terrible.

288
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,080
I don't feel sick at all.

289
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,990
I'm all right now.

290
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,940
Really?

291
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,660
But your husband sent for me.

292
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,620
My husband did?

293
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,740
He's not in right now.

294
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,080
I see.

295
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,380
No? I'll get up then.

296
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,110
You'd better not.

297
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,100
I really overslept.

298
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,300
Is Toshiko at school?

299
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,060
Will you please help me?

300
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,960
I feel weak.

301
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,120
You'd better stay in bed.

302
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,710
Oh dear...

303
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,860
Will you help me too, Hana?

304
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,610
I felt dizzy.

305
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,930
You seemed all right last night.

306
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,070
- Did I?
- Yes.

307
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,610
Take that to the living room.

308
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,920
Kimura...

309
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,420
Tell me,

310
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:57,750
did I do anything improper 
last night?

311
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,730
I was just alarmed.

312
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,360
I didn't know you were so drunk.

313
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,590
I lose control when I drink.

314
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,850
Then you'd best stop drinking.

315
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,630
I drink because my husband 
wants me to.

316
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,270
You do everything he wants?

317
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,760
Thank you for taking care of me.

318
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,720
I remember it vaguely.

319
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
You carried me here,

320
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,720
gave me an injection and nursed
me until dawn.

321
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,030
Injection?

322
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,440
I didn't.

323
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,570
I left around twelve.

324
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,200
But look...

325
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,550
The mark.

326
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,400
You stayed here until dawn, 
didn't you?

327
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,560
Did I...

328
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,300
behave?

329
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,040
What's come over me?

330
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,340
Don't we have fantastic 
dreams sometimes.

331
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,180
It was probably just a 
wild dream.

332
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,120
I always get shots here.

333
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,870
A real thrill.

334
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,120
I smell of blood.

335
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,000
I find my mouth full of sand.

336
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,830
I'm in a desert.

337
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,220
Desert?

338
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,970
It's vast and boundless.

339
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,620
Courvoisier?

340
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,200
Very mellow.

341
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,840
The best kind of brandy.

342
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,060
- Who says so?
- The wine dealer.

343
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,420
Liqours bring bliss, eh, Kimura?

344
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,740
Toshiko should drink a bit.

345
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,190
Kimura should do the drinking.

346
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,230
You bring happiness.

347
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,080
Come every night.

348
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,510
I'm afraid I'm intruding.

349
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,230
I have to study.

350
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,010
Stay a while.

351
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,220
You can take a bath too.

352
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,320
Bathroom?

353
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,530
Ever use a Polaroid camera?

354
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,210
What's that?

355
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,460
You can get a print right away
from the camera.

356
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,650
Here it is.

357
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,290
You can borrow it.

358
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,360
You left the table again.

359
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,390
Because I finished eating.

360
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,560
I'm in an awkward position.

361
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,240
I can't refuse your father's invitation.

362
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,600
Then he starts drinking,
and you leave abruptly.

363
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,700
Did I offend you?

364
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,540
You're his guest.

365
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,570
So there's no reason why I should
entertain you.

366
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,350
Is there?

367
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,610
<i>Kimura! Kimura!</i>

368
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,290
<i>Come help me!</i>

369
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,090
She'll sleep until morning.

370
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,740
I don't know how to thank you.

371
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,900
Don't mention it.

372
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,070
I'm happy to help you.

373
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,010
- <i>Is that you, Kimura?</i>
- Yes.

374
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,440
<i>It is, sir.</i>

375
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,110
I want you to do me a
big favor.

376
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,610
You're looking well.

377
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,270
- Am I?
- Yes. Younger, somehow.

378
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:19,530
I can't seem to focus your camera.

379
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,000
- Is that so?
- Maybe the film was old.

380
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,050
Could I ask you to develop them?

381
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,440
You took them?

382
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,930
But why me, sir?

383
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,820
Can't you guess what I 
photographed?

384
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,680
No, I can't, sir.

385
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,800
I want you to develop them yourself.

386
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,200
As it happens, I studied photography
as a boy.

387
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,340
What was my wife doing?

388
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,770
Speaking with the maid.

389
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,140
<i>Hey, Kimura!
Done yet?</i>

390
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,290
<i>Hurry up!
I'm busy today!</i>

391
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,520
<i>You said you wouldn't be long!</i>

392
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,220
Kimura...

393
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,450
Kimura.

394
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,270
Good.

395
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,710
It's working.

396
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,960
Speak to me.

397
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,200
About what?

398
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,140
Anything.

399
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,690
I'll do more than just talk.

400
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,880
I'll show you something.

401
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,240
Look at her carefully.

402
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,870
It's somebody that we both know 
very well.

403
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,840
- Why...
- I was asked.

404
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,740
- By father?
- Yes.

405
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,900
He asked me to develop the film,

406
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,380
and I've enlarged what he selected.

407
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,840
Don't crumple them.

408
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,810
Look.

409
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,870
Daring postures, eh?

410
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,030
They're reckless.

411
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,590
But why did he ask you?

412
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,970
It's only a guess.

413
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,200
He wants me to desire her.

414
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,790
Then he uses his jealousy as a
kind of stimulant

415
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,230
to make him feel young.

416
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,550
Fascinating.

417
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,270
So you've become my father's
aphrodisiac.

418
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,700
It's hard to refuse him.

419
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,590
But your game is mother.

420
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:54,830
His game.

421
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,160
I can play too.

422
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,970
If it's your wish.

423
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,250
You're very formal.

424
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,890
- Well, I like to present my card.
- You're strange.

425
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:20,310
It's believed to have belonged to
Lord Mori's lady-in-waiting.

426
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,960
My client bought it for his
daughter.

427
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,760
It bears the signature of a great
smith.

428
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,560
Its laquer work is good.

429
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,140
But my client would like your
opinion.

430
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,430
Can you oblige us?

431
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,070
Let me see it.

432
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,800
All right.
Leave this here.

433
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,530
But my client is in a great hurry.

434
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:06,860
- It will take at least 10 days.
- I know.

435
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,160
Showy, old-fashioned weddings are 
being revived,

436
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,300
so we see excellent items nowadays.

437
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:19,630
By the way, Mr. Kenmochi,
that statue there,

438
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,910
- can I take it back?
- Do you have a customer for it?

439
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,240
Not yet, but I'd like to display it
in my shop.

440
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,520
You can bring your buyers here
any time.

441
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,220
May I bring that Korean vase to
my place?

442
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,820
It's yours, but leave it here.

443
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,330
Very well. Will you call me when
you want to sell something?

444
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,900
I'm already sold out, I fear.

445
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,920
I heard you sold three 
scrolls recently.

446
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,560
I was a go-between.

447
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,000
Really? Just call me in case, anyway.

448
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,550
This is for your written opinion
from the other day.

449
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,270
Thank you.

450
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,800
Mr. Kenmochi!

451
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,580
What happened?

452
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,160
Nothing.

453
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,410
I felt faint.

454
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:42,600
Hana, why did you bring such
a thing here?

455
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,400
Don't do it again.

456
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,390
This insecticide will kill a man.

457
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,520
I thought it was cleanser.

458
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,950
That's in the green can.

459
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,950
Isn't this green?

460
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,160
It's red.

461
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,490
Hana, are you color-blind?

462
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:05,840
My grandchild often says so, too.

463
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,470
Maybe I am.

464
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,180
Put it in the storage.
It's dangerous.

465
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,480
I can't tell which is which.

466
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,750
I'll switch the contents so 
I won't make a mistake.

467
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,480
Tell me, what do you think of
Kimura, mother?

468
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,310
He's good and kind.

469
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,260
Is that all?

470
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,770
What else can I say?

471
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:20,530
I wish I were born as pretty
as you.

472
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,030
You're prettier than I am.

473
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,940
You should pay more attention to
your appearance.

474
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,400
Why bother flattering me?

475
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,080
How can you live with yourself?

476
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,030
I've rented a room.

477
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,870
Why all of a sudden?

478
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,910
And I'm moving today.
It's my French teacher's annex.

479
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,820
The rent is cheap.

480
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,870
- What will your father say?
- He gave me the deposit money.

481
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,000
It's all right with me, if he
approves of it.

482
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,000
But I'll miss you.

483
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,800
Kimura will still come,
just the same.

484
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,340
You'll find it more convenient.

485
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,460
What's on your mind, anyway?

486
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,880
Tell me.

487
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,310
Taking advantage of your fainting,

488
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,530
Father is abusing you every night.

489
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,150
A wife should be obedient to her
husband.

490
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:32,090
- Then you knew everything?
- No, nothing at all.

491
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,310
I feel unwell at night lately.

492
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,600
I pass out, don't I?

493
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,200
You seem to enjoy your fainting, mother.

494
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,950
I can't hold liquor at all.

495
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,340
The very smell begins to contaminate
my body.

496
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,010
I feel like taking a bath then.

497
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,100
You have an answer for everything.

498
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,470
But Kimura is aware of it.

499
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,530
Did he tell you?

500
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,270
He wouldn't talk about it.

501
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,800
Father needed a man to talk to,

502
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,710
and Kimura will soon be his son-in-law.

503
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,520
So don't blame Father about it.

504
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,010
You're a model wife, Mother.

505
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,870
I'm an old-fashioned woman.

506
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,970
You may look upon me as stupid.

507
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,630
I'm on your side, Mother.

508
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,520
Don't you worry.

509
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,400
Father!

510
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,060
Father!

511
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,560
Mother did it again.

512
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,750
- What?
- Fainted.

513
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,750
- Where?
- At my place.

514
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,880
- Didn't you go to the movies?
- That's right.

515
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,480
But then Mother and Kimura

516
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,200
came to my place

517
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:37,450
I made tea with a spoonful of 
brandy in it.

518
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,780
Mother and Kimura had some.

519
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,720
I suggested to Mother that she 
have a bath...

520
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,860
I see.
Did you leave them alone?

521
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:56,370
I shouldn't have?

522
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,540
- How did you get here?
- I took a cab.

523
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,060
I'll get ready immediately.

524
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,080
Hurry, Father.
I couldn't find any cabs,

525
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,710
so I had to walk to the garage.

526
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,350
It's been 20 minutes since I left.

527
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,520
Thanks.

528
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,480
Stay 'till I get back.

529
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,410
Don't rush.

530
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,350
You'll need this.

531
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,930
You must have been alarmed.

532
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,670
So this is Toshiko's room, eh?

533
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,530
The bath is by the corridor,
so nobody else knows about this.

534
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,860
Toshiko and I brought her here.

535
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,660
Since she left, I haven't touched her.

536
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,770
I haven't even taken her pulse.

537
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,940
Why?
Aren't you a doctor?

538
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,770
Faster than normal.

539
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,460
She's still very wet.

540
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,480
We tried to dry her off.

541
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,260
She'll catch cold.

542
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,830
Take her clothes.

543
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,260
Will you dress her?

544
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,110
My hands are frozen from the rain.

545
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:42,760
Hey!

546
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,370
Watch it, she's a sick woman.

547
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,240
- Very high?
- Higher than I expected.

548
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,540
How high?

549
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,170
You almost broke the gauge.

550
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,690
Broke it?

551
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,070
A slight exaggeration.

552
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:34,450
But you're in bad shape.
I can tell you that.

553
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,400
You're an alarmist, Dr. Kodama.

554
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,720
Double vision is what we call diplopia.

555
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:46,880
It means hardening of the 
cerebreal arteries.

556
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,440
You might have a stroke.

557
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,880
Instant death, if you're lucky.

558
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,980
Or paralysis.

559
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,480
I can't believe it's that bad.

560
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,480
Have your eyes examined. And your
kidneys and heart. At once.

561
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,380
You know Dr. Soma...

562
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,450
Go and see him.

563
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,390
He's an authority.

564
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,530
Stepping out?

565
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,480
Well, yes.

566
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,340
I haven't seen this coat before.

567
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,910
Is it new?

568
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,160
Does it look funny?

569
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,920
It looks very nice on you.

570
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,990
Do you need any money?

571
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,530
It's lucky I met you here.

572
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,990
I don't need much.

573
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,830
Here's 3,000 yen.

574
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,400
I'm taking a walk myself.

575
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,680
I feel refreshed.

576
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,890
Have a good time.

577
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,420
Where'd the master go now?

578
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,920
- Turn off the light.
- Ok.

579
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,770
Aren't you feeling well?

580
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,260
The light bothers my eyes.

581
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,770
It's due to stiff shoulders.

582
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,640
Think so?

583
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,330
I happen to know a very 
good masseur.

584
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,020
Shall I send for him?

585
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,310
I dislike being pawed by 
a stranger.

586
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,940
You do, huh?

587
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:04,010
Dinner is served, sir.

588
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,560
- You're here.
- Yes.

589
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,640
I'll serve Father.

590
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,890
Bamboo-shoot soup.

591
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,820
Boiled beans.

592
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,140
Frozen bean curd in soy sauce.

593
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,870
Fried lotus roots.

594
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,690
I cooked them.

595
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,680
I prefer meat dishes.

596
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,820
Do you want to have a drink?

597
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,700
Not with you.

598
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:13,250
It's been quite a long time since
I ate alone with you.

599
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,050
An intern's life is rather easy,
I think.

600
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,350
He has three afternoons off.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

601
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:30,660
And Mother goes out three times 
a week. Today is Wednesday.

602
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,440
You see then.

603
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,670
I ask them to the movies,
but both say they're busy.

604
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,420
Your plan didn't work out.

605
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,740
You wanted to embarrass me

606
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,890
by bringing them together.

607
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:59,350
You didn't think your Mother would
take him from you, did you?

608
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,380
Aren't you angry?

609
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,220
Kimura's an opportunist.

610
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,610
He wants to make use of me.

611
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,590
That's the only reason he wants
to marry you.

612
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:15,710
I know he was more interested in
her than you.

613
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:19,340
I don't even like him.

614
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,060
Then why grumble?

615
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,390
Do you know where they go?

616
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:28,110
No. I don't want to.

617
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,120
Osaka.

618
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,050
Osaka?

619
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,280
Want to know more?

620
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,380
How do you know that?

621
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,010
It's his favorite rendezvous.

622
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,150
He took me there once.

623
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,750
So he's as low as that.

624
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,160
I just wanted to have a look.

625
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:53,020
I'm different than Mother.

626
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:56,530
She's loyal and old-fashioned.

627
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,290
She won't betray me.

628
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,100
- You still trust her?
- Yes, I do.

629
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:05,900
I see.

630
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:13,850
But even if

631
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:17,020
there's no adultery, there's

632
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,550
- uglier ways...
- Shut up!

633
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,240
We're your parents, remember!

634
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,550
Such filth!

635
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,180
Get out!

636
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,460
Have you finished?

637
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,050
I've made tea for you.

638
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,340
Time's up, gentlemen.
Let's see what you've written.

639
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,620
Time doesn't wait.
Not even for poetry.

640
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:35,600
I've begun to doubt the good
taste of this.

641
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,490
Grumbling again?

642
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:40,950
You've won the poetry prize for 
the last three months.

643
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,520
No, four months.

644
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,510
No one appreciates my work.

645
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:05,130
Don't exaggerate, please.

646
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,820
A lavish party, it's my turn
next month.

647
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,040
But I can't match this.
Kenmochi's the best.

648
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,870
I'm not an envious man,
mind you,

649
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:32,040
but that wife of Kenmochi's...

650
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:35,370
What a prize she is.

651
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,790
Why this indirect praise?

652
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:42,610
It's a legend that it took him
five years to win her.

653
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:45,100
Don't exaggerate.

654
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,380
He admits it's a fact.

655
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,390
By the way...

656
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,810
What's your phone number?

657
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,420
I've lost my address book,
so I'm asking everyone.

658
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,560
Mine is...

659
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,980
Let me see...

660
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,100
Exchange 12.

661
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,200
Is it?

662
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,580
You're asking me?

663
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,830
I forget things.

664
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:16,130
At your age.

665
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,780
It's not age.

666
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,870
But I forget.

667
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,840
Especially names and places 
and men.

668
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,290
Amnesia?

669
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:25,680
Maybe.

670
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,910
It's temporary.

671
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,310
About 10 minutes.

672
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,860
Know my name?

673
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:37,780
I will.

674
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,330
Wait 10 minutes.

675
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:56,290
Did my husband phone you?

676
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,750
Yes, he did.

677
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,890
He must have called from outside.

678
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,270
Ikuko...

679
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,380
I feel awkward in coming here.

680
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:18,920
I came because Father asked me to.

681
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,500
He said it was important.

682
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:26,320
Really? He hasn't said anything 
to me.

683
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,440
Excuse me.

684
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,650
I'm a chiropractor.

685
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,280
Aren't you at the wrong house?

686
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,990
Isn't this the Kenmochi house?

687
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:44,820
It is, but we have no need of 
a masseur.

688
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,960
I sent for him, as the master ordered,
m'aam.

689
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,140
Come right in, doctor.

690
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:02,000
He hates to be called 'masseur',
call him 'doctor'.

691
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,790
Doctor, I'm awfully sorry.
She forgot to tell me.

692
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,110
Mrs. Kenmochi.

693
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,970
How do you do, m'aam?

694
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:18,930
- Hana, take the doctor to his room.
- Yes.

695
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,910
Why don't you come in?

696
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,190
You're very stiff.

697
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:41,200
You'll feel better soon.

698
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,380
Ouch.

699
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:46,680
- Rub more softly.
- Softly?

700
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,770
But that wouldn't do you 
any good.

701
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,160
Kimura and Toshiko are here.

702
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,330
Did you call them?

703
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:02,370
Yes, bring them in.

704
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,480
Here?

705
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,920
Forgive me.

706
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,720
I wanted to come earlier.

707
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:35,490
I wanted to bring you some cod roes
from home, sir.

708
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,790
I've been waiting for them 
to arrive.

709
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,530
Forgive me.

710
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:43,780
Are you all right?

711
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,210
I can stand it.

712
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,450
No, you've had enough.

713
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,610
You're stiff

714
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:52,040
and it's painful.

715
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,690
Expert as I am,

716
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,310
I can't cure it with one 
treatment.

717
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,970
It's due to your high 
blood pressure.

718
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:07,050
No specialist can cure it quickly.

719
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:14,370
I also practice acupuncture 
and moxibustion.

720
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,350
I'll cure you.
Don't worry.

721
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,570
Is his blood pressure high?

722
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:23,940
- Must be over 200.
- Quiet for a moment.

723
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:30,520
I asked you to come to fix
the date for your wedding.

724
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:38,870
- Why talk about it now?
- Pay no attention to me.

725
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:44,410
As my profession takes me to 
many homes,

726
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:47,100
I've learned to mind my 
own business.

727
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:51,370
And to hear nothing I shouldn't.

728
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,370
Forget I'm here.

729
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:56,980
But may I congratulate you
just the same?

730
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,990
My health is declining rapidly.

731
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:04,160
I'm anxious to have 
a grandchild.

732
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,690
Let's discuss it after this 
is over.

733
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:10,210
Wait out there.

734
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,340
M'aam.

735
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:22,650
Can I have three towels and some
hot water?

736
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:35,230
That's the first time I've heard
him whimper.

737
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,820
He seems to be giving up.

738
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:42,030
- Is that so?
- With high blood pressure.

739
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,650
That quack.

740
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,120
But excitement is bad for him.

741
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,640
Yes, that's right.

742
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:52,450
Mother may have known about his
failing health

743
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,330
and wanted to kill him 
by excitement

744
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:59,180
with your help.

745
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,430
Don't say such a thing.

746
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:06,050
Though I know you're joking.

747
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,510
We own nothing here.

748
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,440
Even the house is mortgaged.

749
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,610
I'm sorry to hear it.

750
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:27,200
But your Mother is so cheerful.

751
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,300
She was born that way.

752
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,590
I'm sure she'll make a 
carefree beggar.

753
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:34,880
You too?

754
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,010
Will we get married, Kimura?

755
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,140
We're formally engaged today.

756
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,100
Let's celebrate.

757
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,660
You're kind to me when 
Mother isn't around.

758
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,770
I love you, so I care for your Mother.

759
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,770
Isn't Father absurd?

760
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,720
To call that Masseur...

761
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:05,990
He gives me a creepy feeling.

762
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,290
Is he finished?

763
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,530
It'll take another hour.

764
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,090
Father must be tired.

765
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:15,560
He says that he can't talk with
you today.

766
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,800
- I see.
- He's sorry that he asked you to come

767
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,750
He suggests that we should go
to the movies.

768
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,710
Not me.

769
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,270
If you're not going, I won't either.

770
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,000
I'm reluctant as Father isn't well.

771
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:34,700
But if he wants it, we'd better go.

772
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,940
You're right.

773
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:37,870
Let's go.

774
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,460
All right.

775
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,850
I think I'd better go back.

776
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:59,190
- I'm worried.
- Going home?

777
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,910
I think I'll go shopping first.

778
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,580
You two go ahead.

779
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,050
Excuse me.

780
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:13,480
Shall we go?

781
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,750
Don't you have to go?

782
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:19,140
Oh, I'm on duty today.

783
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:21,530
Good thing you reminded me.

784
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,770
I'll have time off in a few days.

785
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,440
What brought you home so soon?

786
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:03,980
I'm sorry.

787
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,000
Enjoy the movie?

788
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,540
What's the matter?

789
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,870
You know where I've been,
don't you?

790
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,900
You wanted me to go to him.

791
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:43,860
Kimura's?

792
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,430
I was a fool, playing a fine lady.

793
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,760
I'm beginning to see it now.

794
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,830
I feel I've awakened as a woman.

795
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:02,810
You've been so patient with me.

796
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,720
For such a long time,

797
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:09,930
I've made you suffer.

798
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:12,320
Forgive me.

799
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,520
You're sweet.

800
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,760
Thank you.

801
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:21,840
But please believe me,

802
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,250
nothing ever happened between Kimura
and me.

803
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,710
I believe you.

804
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,310
Yes, I do.

805
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,740
I brought it down for company.

806
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,360
Standing there that way,
it reminds me of you.

807
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,600
You look very sick.

808
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,610
I made you strain yourself,
didn't I?

809
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:05,860
The doctor warned me several 
months ago

810
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,560
that I should take care of
my health.

811
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,300
But I thought life would be empty,

812
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:19,060
if I had to give up our pleasures.

813
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:26,310
At last, you've become mine,
body and soul.

814
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,620
I'm satisfied.

815
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:32,860
I'll do anything you want me to.

816
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,890
I'm sorry to trouble you
so late at night.

817
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,190
This is Mrs. Kenmochi.
Thank you, Ma'am.

818
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:49,470
Hello Toshiko.

819
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,200
Father is in danger.
Come at once.

820
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:54,750
Bring some ice.

821
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,960
Dr. Kodama's office?

822
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:19,750
My husband had a stroke.
Can the doctor come at once?

823
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:22,850
Will you tell the doctor

824
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:25,020
I'll be expecting him?

825
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:54,040
It's a stroke.

826
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,670
It must have been sudden.

827
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:14,430
- Which side?
- His left side is paralyzed.

828
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:16,230
So cool the other side.

829
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,290
Give me some light.

830
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:48,820
Bring it here.

831
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,280
His blood pressure is 190.

832
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,060
It was lowered by the hemorrhage.

833
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:22,590
He had a masseur rub him for
hours yesterday.

834
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:24,140
That was bad.

835
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:26,550
It's probably the direct cause.

836
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,990
I'll come again later.

837
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:32,950
But you'd better ask Dr. Soma
to come.

838
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:39,080
Shall I ask our relatives to come?

839
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,350
You can wait.

840
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,740
Better get a trained nurse.

841
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:45,700
I'll send you one.

842
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:53,320
Toshiko was here all night.

843
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:55,730
You don't need to come.

844
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:00,660
He's unconscious anyway, and
our house is a mess.

845
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:04,440
I just wanted to let you know.

846
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:09,870
Yes, I'm going to phone Dr. Soma
later.

847
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,590
Yes, I'm all right.

848
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,990
- Ah. Dr. Kodama sent you?
- I'm from the nurse's agency.

849
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,370
My name is Koike.

850
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:45,520
He began to snore around 8 o'clock.

851
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:47,640
What do you think?

852
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:52,540
It's dangerous when one is in
a coma too long.

853
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,820
Leave your bag in the other room.

854
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,070
I've prepared a room for you.

855
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:11,940
I'd better stay as near the patient
as possible.

856
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:16,190
I see. Then you may use this room.

857
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,620
Mr. Kimura's here.

858
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,330
How is he?

859
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:43,450
I didn't want to disturb you,
but I just wanted to see him.

860
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:45,390
He's still in a coma.

861
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,370
Come with me.

862
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:49,450
Excuse us.

863
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:02,900
I told you on the phone 
not to come.

864
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,650
But it's common courtesy.

865
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,980
But not before Dr. Soma's visit.

866
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,950
You're right. That would have
looked better.

867
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:13,030
You'd better go now.

868
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:17,150
You can't go out while he's
like this, can you?

869
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:33,870
It's for the back door.

870
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:38,030
Hana leaves at seven.

871
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,420
Toshiko will leave by eight.

872
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:46,550
The nurse will go to bed by ten,
when I'll relieve her.

873
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,910
Come at eleven tonight.

874
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,240
How's he getting along?

875
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:33,600
Dr. Soma was of the same opinion
as Dr. Kodama.

876
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:37,410
He came out of the coma
at about 5 o'clock.

877
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,170
I'm glad to hear it.

878
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:42,230
I think he's a fortunate man.

879
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,830
Many families would suffer financially

880
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:48,890
but he can receive proper care.

881
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:53,200
Money has never been a problem for us.

882
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,420
Naturally, he's a resourceful man.

883
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,210
I love you, Ikuko.

884
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:11,690
Toshiko told me that you wanted to
kill him by exciting him.

885
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:15,000
If she could see us now...

886
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:19,020
I know we shouldn't excite him,

887
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:22,900
but he'll be sick a long time.

888
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,600
I must come!

889
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,800
You're so kind.

890
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,730
What are we going to do?

891
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:36,250
I've always been obedient to him,

892
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:40,690
so I'm anxious to respect his wish.

893
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:44,150
You want me to marry Toshiko?

894
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:48,000
She'd be delighted if you'd take her.

895
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:50,880
I'll do as you wish.

896
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:55,540
Marry her... and live here.

897
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:59,000
You can practice here.

898
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:03,240
Can I?

899
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,150
It's far away from the city center.

900
01:29:10,130 --> 01:29:12,600
But I mustn't ask for much.

901
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,650
Ah, what a lucky man I am!

902
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,990
I don't like the smell of this job.

903
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,470
But I want you to stay.

904
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:44,440
The master will be too helpless
without you.

905
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:50,040
It's a nurse's duty to take good
care of her patient.

906
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,200
If the family is seriously worried...

907
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,140
Well, I'll do the best I can.

908
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,210
That's it.

909
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,950
You see it all, don't you?

910
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,840
You're sharp.

911
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,430
It's murder.

912
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:06,890
Right, you are.

913
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,230
Exactly.

914
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,720
Miss Koike... Oh, you're eating.

915
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,010
Father's awake now.

916
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,640
I just sent the masseur away.

917
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,660
I shouldn't have sent for him.

918
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:28,710
I'm awfully sorry.

919
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,690
So high-handed!

920
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:38,040
Nobody else is nice to him, so I...

921
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:49,240
It's wonderful that you 
can speak again.

922
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:55,060
F-O-O-T

923
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,240
Didn't he say "footstep"?

924
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,650
What footstep, Father?

925
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,210
What does he mean?

926
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:30,230
Well...

927
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:35,180
The doctors said yesterday

928
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,640
the pressure ought to go down.

929
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:42,160
I told them that he couldn't 
sleep that much.

930
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,670
He can't sleep?

931
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,720
It was the night before last.

932
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:51,880
Soon after I went to bed,
I heard footsteps in the yard.

933
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,630
Last night, also?

934
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,310
I don't know. I fall asleep easily.

935
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:43,720
I gave Miss Koike a day off today.

936
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:46,830
Toshiko hasn't shown up either.

937
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:50,900
The weather is nice today.

938
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:07,910
What do you want?

939
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,500
You don't want to eat?

940
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,890
You want me to strip?

941
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:26,870
Don't think of such a thing.

942
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:31,580
I'm beginning to feel cold.

943
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:33,890
Can I dress now?

944
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,380
He's dead.

945
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,490
You musn't work.
You're tired.

946
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:43,320
I work to forget everything.

947
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,750
So many distinguished people.

948
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,240
The mayor, too.

949
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:51,970
The red can is here again, Hana.

950
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:56,200
- That's the cleanser.
- I told you it wasn't.

951
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:59,830
So I arranged it so that I wouldn't
make a mistake again.

952
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:00,970
What is it?

953
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:06,030
She's color blind, and brings
insecticide for cleanser.

954
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:08,270
Does that red can contain 
insecticide?

955
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:14,600
You must be careful.
It's poisonous.

956
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:18,480
- But it's cleanser.
- No, it's not.

957
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,290
- What an ignorant woman!
- Take it away.

958
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,610
- Nice weather.
- Yes.

959
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,740
Sorry I've kept you waiting.

960
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:10,250
I had to fix my hair.

961
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:13,080
I had no time to go to the 
beauty parlor.

962
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:35,270
What's this party for?

963
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:39,780
In recognition of your devoted
services.

964
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,450
Thank you very much, 
Kimura and Toshiko.

965
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:45,910
I couldn't help you at all.

966
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:49,790
It's a terrible thing to 
lose one's husband.

967
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,810
He'd protected me all the time.

968
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:59,420
You've worked so hard,
disposing of everything

969
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:01,330
I'm glad they're gone.

970
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:05,960
I don't have to worry anymore about
breaking them.

971
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,970
His death was so sudden.

972
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:10,420
Dr. Soma was surprised.

973
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,300
That was the nurse's day off.

974
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,870
It happened just as Mother 
brought his food.

975
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:21,730
Luckily, I was there at the end.

976
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:24,590
How fortunate, Mother.

977
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,710
He must have died happily.

978
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:34,270
I suppose death can be both 
peaceful and sad.

979
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:44,120
I started my diary last night.

980
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,160
I'll go get it.

981
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,850
<i>How can I get out of this?</i>

982
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,370
<i>Look at this empty house.</i>

983
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:03,790
<i>The curio dealers took away 
everything of value.</i>

984
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:07,150
<i>They weren't his property.</i>

985
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,810
<i>It must be true that the 
house is mortgaged.</i>

986
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:18,470
<i>Though he was famous,
he's dead now</i>

987
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,890
<i>and useless, as he's left nothing.</i>

988
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:25,610
<i>Ikuko is pretty, all right,</i>

989
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,450
<i>but doesn't appeal to me.</i>

990
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,450
<i>Toshiko is out of the question.</i>

991
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,730
<i>Rotten luck.</i>

992
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,340
Isn't the salad ready yet?

993
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,470
In a few minutes, ma'am.

994
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:37,080
Why bring tea so soon?

995
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:56,880
Ah, thanks.

996
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:02,670
Suddenly I wanted to drink tea with brandy.

997
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:06,560
When you drink brandy,
it's an event.

998
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:24,060
<i>POISON</i>

999
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,230
Why don't you keep a diary?

1000
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:53,660
I have nothing to write about.

1001
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:58,050
We're turning over a new leaf,
as it were.

1002
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:01,560
It'll help us to enter into
a new life.

1003
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:02,780
Mother...

1004
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:05,170
Would you mind reading your
diary to us?

1005
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,590
All right.
Later. Yes.

1006
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:10,590
A drink may give me courage.

1007
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:29,390
What a combination!
Salad and tea!

1008
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,350
Kimura, what's wrong 
with your appetite?

1009
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,450
<i>She's going to read her diary to us.</i>

1010
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:14,090
<i>Sometimes her innocence is weird.</i>

1011
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:17,730
<i>But I can guess what's in it.</i>

1012
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:21,190
<i>An array of nice, sentimental words.</i>

1013
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:25,340
<i>What an odd taste this salad has.</i>

1014
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:28,480
It tastes strange!

1015
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:32,200
Does it?

1016
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:36,980
You're right.

1017
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:40,580
Toshiko! What happened?

1018
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:44,850
<i>Why me?</i>

1019
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:48,210
<i>Why poison me?</i>

1020
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,120
<i>What did I do?</i>

1021
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:54,170
<i>It's unfair.</i>

1022
01:44:01,630 --> 01:44:02,890
Hana... It's your fault.

1023
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,180
Look what you've done.

1024
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,560
"This is the first diary I've 
ever started."

1025
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:42,190
"I wonder how long I can 
keep it up?"

1026
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:47,790
"Why am I hesitant when our 
new life is ahead of us?"

1027
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:51,590
"Kimura and Toshiko will make 
a good match."

1028
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:55,580
"The three of us are turning over 
a new leaf."

1029
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:57,310
"My late husband will be glad."

1030
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:01,010
"Someday, we'll all meet."

1031
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:03,680
- Date?
- March 16.

1032
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,220
The night before the tragedy.

1033
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,350
A prophecy.

1034
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,370
Her handwriting?

1035
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:11,790
Definitely, sir.

1036
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,210
Hana's confession doesn't 
count then.

1037
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:19,330
She could've put poison in 
the salad,

1038
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:21,810
but so could the others.

1039
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:25,990
Hana said that Mrs. Kenmochi 
warned her about the poison.

1040
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:28,280
Hana has no motive.

1041
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:31,730
The stuff was used for the
kitchen garden during the war.

1042
01:45:31,850 --> 01:45:34,130
It was learned he'd 
had no income recently

1043
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:38,530
The house is mortgaged.

1044
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:43,480
They had nothing to live on.

1045
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:46,910
That's obvious.
I think she committed suicide,

1046
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:50,190
followed by the young couple.

1047
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:53,190
She was known as a faithful wife.

1048
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:57,640
Kenmochi's friends all vouch for it.

1049
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:03,830
As I've repeatedly told you,

1050
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:07,110
it was I who killed them.

1051
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:10,570
We're busy people, mind you.

1052
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,110
With many other things to do,

1053
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:18,200
so that we can maintain public peace.

1054
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:21,390
I know they were wicked,

1055
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:24,790
but it's worse to murder them.

1056
01:46:25,770 --> 01:46:27,890
Ask her to go home, will you?

1057
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,810
We'll arrest you if you don't go.

1058
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:48,580
FINANCIAL RUIN DRIVES MRS. KENMOCHI TO SUICIDE, 
DAUGHTER & FIANCE FOLLOW.

1059
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:55,550
THE END
