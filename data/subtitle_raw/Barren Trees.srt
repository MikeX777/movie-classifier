1
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,300
US Marshall Service.

2
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,536
Patch me to the
Marshall, Hugh Tanley.

3
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,839
What's this regarding?

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,141
Tell him it's Billy Burke.

5
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:51,434
Billy?

6
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:52,518
Tanley.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,720
What's going on?

8
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,056
I wanna move.

9
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,792
Move, move where?

10
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,560
Anywhere.

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,464
Have you talked to her?

12
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,633
You can't just take the
kids and disappear, Bill.

13
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:08,868
What not?

14
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,102
'Cause you can't.

15
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,336
I wanna start over.

16
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,338
You did it before,
you can do it again.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,606
It doesn't work like that.

18
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,097
Then explain exactly

19
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:17,587
how it's suppose to fucking work

20
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:19,077
'cause as far as I can
tell all you people do

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,346
is yank a guy out of his life

22
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,613
and toss him in
the fucking barrel.

23
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,438
Calm down.

24
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,262
Don't tell me
to fucking calm down.

25
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:27,086
Where would you be
if you back in Boston, huh?

26
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,456
The river, the ground,
or stuffed in snowbank

27
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,491
with your teeth knocked out
and a slug in your temple?

28
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,293
We saved you, Bill.

29
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:38,597
Just keep your head
down and live your life.

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,101
You're not Billy Burke any more.

31
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,221
You gonna pay for that?

32
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,434
Just dock it.

33
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,646
Dock it from what?

34
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:39,858
You're two hours late.

35
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,729
I had to stay after school.

36
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:48,901
Fuck.

37
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:49,903
Hey.

38
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,598
The school has obligation

39
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,850
to look into any
accusations of this nature.

40
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,252
What exactly
is he being accused of?

41
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,698
I'm sure you're aware

42
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,143
of the incident that
occurred last week?

43
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:11,588
What does that have
to do with Darren?

44
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:12,925
Several students came forward

45
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,259
and said that he was
the one responsible

46
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,527
for providing the narcotics.

47
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,196
That's ridiculous.

48
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,364
- Miss Greenwood...
- Darren's a

49
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,531
straight A student.

50
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,698
Miss Greenwood, I understand...

51
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,865
And who the hell are these
students you're talking about?

52
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,269
I can't give you that infor...

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,670
What makes their word
better than my sons?

54
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,350
Maybe you ought
to look into them,

55
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,029
instead of the kids they're
trying to dump all the blame on.

56
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,708
I don't believe that's the
situation here, Miss Greenwood.

57
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,210
Based on what?

58
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,313
Based on Darren's behavior.

59
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,716
He's been absent 22 days in
the last 40 days of school.

60
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,552
His grades are plummeting,
he flunking three subjects,

61
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,688
he's hanging around with
a different group of kids.

62
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,892
Why hasn't anyone
contacted me about this?

63
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,896
We did, I have a, I have
a signed progress report

64
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,233
from two weeks ago
from both of you.

65
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,386
Who do you think you are?

66
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:59,004
I scribbled a name on
a piece of paper, Carol.

67
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,372
Why?

68
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,273
To avoid this.

69
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,092
Avoid what?

70
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:04,910
You losing your fucking
mind over nothing at all.

71
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,912
He's a kid, kid's fuck up.

72
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,249
He doesn't need to hear from
you when you're like this.

73
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,751
Did you even hear
what was said in there?

74
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,069
Two kids died, Mitch.

75
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,386
They were on pills
for Christ sake.

76
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,655
They was friends.

77
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,290
And now they're dead.

78
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,924
Darren will be next if
we don't do something.

79
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,660
Do what, Carol?

80
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,394
What the fuck do you wanna do?

81
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,496
You wanna ignore
this whole thing,

82
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,530
act like it didn't happen?

83
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,765
That's right.

84
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,500
You're pathetic.

85
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,481
Two of his friends just died,

86
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:33,693
whether he sold them
the pills or not.

87
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:35,905
You think now is the
time to talk about this?

88
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,143
If he was your son,

89
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,378
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

90
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,958
When you're finished with that,

91
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,459
start stocking the shelves.

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,960
I got to go pick up your brother.

93
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,132
What can I get ya?

94
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,733
Pack of reds.

95
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,521
Billy.

96
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,592
Yeah, on the the corner.

97
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,927
Be right there.

98
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,088
You got your mother
in a panic, you know?

99
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,359
I should charge you gas money

100
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,961
for all the driving around
I just did looking for ya.

101
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,200
What are we doin' here, Darren?

102
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,668
Waiting for a train.

103
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,804
Where you goin'?

104
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,071
Nowhere.

105
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,874
Then what are we waitin' for?

106
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,591
How long you been here?

107
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,827
Since the store closed.

108
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,599
I don't know, but I
think a couple of trains

109
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,134
have come by since then.

110
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,602
Don't be a dick.

111
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,137
I'm just saying.

112
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,608
I tried all right?

113
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,580
Throwing yourself
in front of a train

114
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,081
ain't something you
try and fail at.

115
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,116
You either do it or you don't.

116
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,751
I'm gonna do it.

117
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,120
All right.

118
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,488
You can't stop me.

119
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,490
Fine.

120
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,531
Wanna talk about it?

121
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,741
It ain't your fault,
you know that right?

122
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,149
Those kids were gonna do
whatever they were gonna do

123
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,585
whether you helped them or not.

124
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,653
It happens.

125
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,656
No it doesn't.

126
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,659
Well it did.

127
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,597
A lot of people
done plenty worse.

128
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,065
Yeah, like who?

129
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,947
It'll go away, you just
got to get it out of your head.

130
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,286
You think it's that easy?

131
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:18,757
What's the worse thing
you've ever done to somebody?

132
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,960
If it was anything like this,

133
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,930
you'd know this
isn't going away.

134
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,841
Come on, let's get outta here.

135
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,495
You gettin' hungry?

136
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,398
Nah, I'm good.

137
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
Got a coupon for
a pizza in here.

138
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,235
I was thinking
'bout grabbing one.

139
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,870
If you get it, I'll eat it,

140
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,504
but not really that hungry.

141
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,952
What did you get your
mother for Christmas?

142
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,020
Nothing yet.

143
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,488
Better get on that.

144
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,490
I don't know what to get her.

145
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,475
Well, you better
get her something,

146
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,459
she's you're mother
for Christ's sake.

147
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,895
What did you get her?

148
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,430
Nothing yet.

149
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,133
So what are you giving
me a hard time for?

150
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,185
I'm just her husband,
you're her suppose

151
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:59,236
to be on top of
that kind of stuff.

152
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,213
Well, I don't
know what she wants.

153
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,114
Got any ideas?

154
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,418
I was kinda hoping
you had something.

155
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,287
Well, maybe we'll get
her a gift together,

156
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,206
but it's got to be a good one

157
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,124
or she think we got lazy and
screwed her out of her present.

158
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,793
Isn't that what's happening?

159
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,461
Not if it's a good one.

160
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,929
How 'bout we get
her a gift card?

161
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,043
No, we can't get
her a gift card.

162
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:29,156
If we get her a gift card, we
might as well get her cash.

163
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:31,269
Get her cash, we might as
well get her nothing at all.

164
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,437
How 'bout one of those
elliptical machines

165
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,172
she's been talking about?

166
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,906
No, she'll make me use it.

167
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,877
You know what?

168
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,311
We can get her one of
those, one of those vacuums

169
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,280
that cleans the floor by itself.

170
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,493
Those exist?

171
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:44,705
Yeah, they got 'em
at the department store

172
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:45,917
down the road.

173
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,186
What time they open til?

174
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,557
Bout another half hour.

175
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,497
It's a good idea, why don't
you run up there and grab one.

176
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,633
And when you're done,
swing by and pick me up.

177
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,202
You sure?

178
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,770
Mom hasn't been letting me
drive the past couple weeks.

179
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,338
No, I trust you.

180
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,906
Just pick me up
when you're done.

181
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,140
Thanks dad.

182
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:19,217
What can I get for you?

183
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,219
Newports.

184
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,297
Anything else?

185
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,977
Ten thousand.

186
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:46,978
Ten?

187
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,831
On average.

188
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,683
But that varies depending
on the particulars.

189
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,187
What particulars
you talking about?

190
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,589
Well, the casket, for instance.

191
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,541
An average casket,
it'll set you back

192
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,492
about two and half grand,
but that price fluctuates

193
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,462
depending on the quality
of the specific casket

194
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,997
that you chose.

195
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,185
How much for that one?

196
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:32,090
That one's around four or 5,000.

197
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,125
I only got two.

198
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,261
For the casket?

199
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,265
For everything.

200
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,072
Have
you thought about cremation?

201
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,074
No, no.

202
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,478
Well, if you'd like I could...

203
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,546
I'm not burning my mother.

204
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,482
She's gettin' buried.

205
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,619
I understand

206
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,020
where you're coming
from, but cremation...

207
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,755
It's not an option.

208
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,726
She wants to be
buried, not burned.

209
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:18,102
That'll
be impossible with only 2,000.

210
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,247
Look, I can give
you a couple of days

211
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,649
to figure something out,
maybe ask a relative

212
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:35,253
if they mind pitching in,
but these are the prices

213
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,722
you're gonna find everywhere.

214
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,591
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,611
Hey, Nicole.

216
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:14,613
Derek.

217
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,452
What are you doing here?

218
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,588
I'm sorry, I didn't
wanna just show up,

219
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,959
but you were suppose to
call after your appoint.

220
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,760
What's up?

221
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,762
Hi.

222
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,698
What's all that?

223
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,803
I, I got it for you
because of the doctor.

224
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,446
Could we talk in the
other room for a minute?

225
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,882
You can't just show up
without calling, Derek.

226
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,784
I've been calling all day.

227
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,654
Well, my phone's been dead.

228
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,924
Well, how am I
suppose to know that?

229
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,261
You gonna tell
me what's going on?

230
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,028
I have no idea what's going on.

231
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,796
That's why I'm here.

232
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,765
I mean how did it go?

233
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,568
How did what go?

234
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,936
You know the,

235
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:15,941
the test.

236
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,546
What, what's wrong?

237
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:28,319
Nothing, it... I'm fine.

238
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:31,689
Fine, what's that
mean, what's fine?

239
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:35,493
I mean, I mean they
didn't find anything.

240
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,300
That's, that's great.

241
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:01,953
So?

242
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,823
So?

243
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,959
So, they didn't find anything,

244
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,828
where's that leave us?

245
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,630
What do you mean?

246
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,901
I mean, are we getting
back together or?

247
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,774
You said you only
wanted to break up

248
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,510
because you might have cancer.

249
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,364
You said you didn't
want me to be the guy

250
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:30,815
with a sick girlfriend
and you needed some time.

251
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,750
I know what I said.

252
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,756
So, are we back together?

253
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,903
I don't, I don't get it.

254
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,775
Um, you said you only
wanted to break up

255
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,777
because of the cancer.

256
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:23,534
It ain't gonna get any easier.

257
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,586
Eddie.

258
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,824
You look like shit.

259
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:47,858
Gee, thanks.

260
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,277
I'm just saying.

261
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:52,695
Yeah, well, you're no
fucking prize either pal.

262
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,565
Where the hell you get a dog?

263
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,434
She's my mother's.

264
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,810
How's that goin'
with your mother?

265
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,111
That's why I called.

266
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,846
Yeah, I figured.

267
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,082
So you got something or what?

268
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,083
Yeah, I got something.

269
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,718
Any good?

270
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
Could be.

271
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,721
A shot in the dark, though.

272
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,089
Oh.

273
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,591
Well, if we get
done, it's 15 a pop,

274
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,992
but I ain't sure
I like what it is.

275
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,461
15 a piece?

276
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,162
Is it coming from Lou?

277
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,230
I think so, but I
didn't talk to him.

278
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,599
I talked to a Jackknife.

279
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,101
Oh, well let me know.

280
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,770
You ever heard of Billy Burke?

281
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,738
He used to run around
with Bobby Green.

282
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,240
Pulled a couple of
scores back in the day.

283
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,741
Billy Burke used
to own that store

284
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,710
on Seymour Street when
we were kids, right?

285
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,295
That's the one.

286
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:42,879
I remember him, what
ever happened to him?

287
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,482
Fucking rat.

288
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,067
About eight years ago
they found his brother

289
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,651
stuffed in a snowbank
down on the waterfront.

290
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,887
Billy flipped with the feds
and vanished not long after.

291
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,755
What are you saying?

292
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:56,026
Got a couple of friends of
ours put away for a while.

293
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,098
You been a, been watching
the news last couple weeks?

294
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,501
A little bit.

295
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,069
You hear about that body they

296
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,636
found up in New Hampshire?

297
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,260
A couple of weeks ago
some old bombs got dropped

298
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,245
outside a Sheriff's station,
a middle east bonfire.

299
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:15,112
Yeah?

300
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,814
Yeah.

301
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:17,815
So what?

302
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:22,953
So they ID-ed the body
day before yesterday.

303
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,924
Gordon Belkin.

304
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,595
Gordon Belkin?

305
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,998
How?

306
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,666
Someone dug him up.

307
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,234
What the purpose
somebody dig him up?

308
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,801
I don't know, but Jackknife
says only two people

309
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,638
knew where Belkin's
body was buried.

310
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,106
Bobby was one of them,
everybody knows that.

311
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,573
Yeah, but Bobby's got
another year left at Walpole,

312
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,560
so they don't know
it wasn't him.

313
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:47,545
Who's the other person?

314
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,180
Billy Burke.

315
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,084
Burke's in New Hampshire?

316
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,220
Right in the middle
of East Bumfuck.

317
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,721
And you wanna go get him?

318
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,789
15 a pop.

319
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,826
You're a retarded
motherfucker, ain't ya?

320
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,450
I hope not.

321
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:06,073
I'm just out here and
listen to you ramble

322
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,696
for five minutes and that's
all you came to tell me, man?

323
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,250
Yeah.

324
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,801
I need eight grand by the
end of this week, Derek.

325
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,128
So what the fuck are
we doing standing around

326
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,454
and talking about it?

327
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:14,780
Let's go get him.

328
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,106
He's a wuss sack,
you fucking dumb ass.

329
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,342
He's got a new name,
he's got a new life.

330
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,743
We don't even know if
he's inside the town

331
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,896
or inside the state.

332
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:24,048
There's only one
way to find out.

333
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:29,153
What the fuck you waste
my time with this for, man?

334
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,295
I got to get out of here, man.

335
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:42,199
A weekend away sound good
and 15K sounds better.

336
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,867
I need a sure thing.

337
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,136
Well you don't have one.

338
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,039
What else you got?

339
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,373
Ma?

340
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,012
What are you doing here?

341
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,116
Ma.

342
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:12,082
That sounds like Lake Ossipee?

343
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,053
Think it did.

344
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,025
I went to camp up
there one summer.

345
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,927
Lake Ossipee.

346
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,546
They used to have this program

347
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,164
where they'd round
up all the kids

348
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,816
running around the projects

349
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,467
and ship 'em up
north for two weeks.

350
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:34,271
I thought I remember
you being there.

351
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,372
The older kids were
fucking pricks.

352
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,040
I remember they used to,

353
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,342
they used to take
these tube socks

354
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,409
and fill 'em up with baby powder

355
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,595
and whip us with 'em.

356
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:43,780
Felt like getting hit
with a fucking rock.

357
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,351
Got these white marks
all over you clothes.

358
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,455
I remember this one night,

359
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,391
I was sittin' in the cabin
with some older kids.

360
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,082
I don't know what I
was doin' in there,

361
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,772
'cause I wasn't hangin'
out with any of them,

362
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,462
but any way, I'm
sittin' in there

363
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,798
and I hear 'em all talking

364
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,132
and they're talking about how

365
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,466
they're gonna wail til we
all fall asleep that night

366
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,286
and then they're gonna run in

367
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:07,104
and beat the shit out of
us with those powder socks.

368
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,807
So I hear that and I
think not me, right?

369
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,341
But I don't know what to do

370
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,210
because there are six of them

371
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,078
and there's one of me and I
don't want to get my ass kicked,

372
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,946
so what I ended up
doing was, I stood up

373
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,549
and I walked right through
the their little powwow.

374
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:20,884
You know, just get
their attention, right?

375
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,870
Then I go over into
the corner of the room

376
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,855
and I grab this, there was
a wooden broom stick there.

377
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,356
I kicked it and snapped
it right in half.

378
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,426
Look at the sharp
end for a second.

379
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,562
Then I go over to the
other side of the room

380
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:34,198
and I got a, there was a metal
folding chair laying there,

381
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,178
so I grabbed the
piece of the metal

382
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,157
and I twisted and twisted
and snapped it off.

383
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:40,136
It was a little metal pipe,
I tucked in my sleeve.

384
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,840
So then I go back over
and I sit down with them.

385
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,608
I got the broken
broomstick in one hand,

386
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,393
the metal pipe up my sleeve.

387
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,177
I look 'em all square
in the face and I say,

388
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,947
if any of you come
near me tonight

389
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,983
I'll stab you in
the fucking chest.

390
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:57,888
They didn't bother
me after that.

391
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,591
You sure you weren't
up there with us?

392
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:01,593
No.

393
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,998
Probably would of liked it.

394
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,169
I remember my a, had my
first girlfriend up there.

395
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,403
Leah Donahue.

396
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
She's from Dorchester.

397
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,413
We used to go tubing
out on the lake.

398
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,224
What's wrong with you?

399
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,626
What you mean?

400
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,412
I mean you been
staring out the window

401
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,929
for the last half hour.

402
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,532
Aren't that windows are for?

403
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,134
Really?

404
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,169
You gonna be like that?

405
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,174
You don't wanna
talk that's fine.

406
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,309
It's just a long fucking drive

407
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,591
for me to be sittin' here
talking to myself the whole way.

408
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:03,053
Do you ever think
about eternity?

409
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,023
What?

410
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,391
You know like,

411
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,395
what happens after you die.

412
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,465
What are you talkin' about?

413
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,200
I just told you.

414
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,236
Yeah, but.

415
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,543
Wonder if this is it?

416
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,345
No heaven, no hell.

417
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,083
Just this.

418
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,388
And nothing and then we're sad.

419
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:42,392
There's nothing.

420
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:47,564
I been trying to wrap
my head around this.

421
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,367
Was just suffocating.

422
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:05,282
Just shut the fuck up
and stare out your window.

423
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,206
Derek.

424
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,142
Where'd you put it?

425
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,110
Threw it out.

426
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,445
Where?

427
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,779
Well, it ain't in that dumpster.

428
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,113
You ain't gonna
find it in there.

429
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,447
Get a hold of yourself.

430
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,221
There was $300 worth
of booze in the cooler.

431
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,422
Oh yeah?

432
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,857
Look like the good stuff.

433
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,792
You think this is funny?

434
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,528
No, I don't.

435
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,796
You owe me $300.

436
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:33,730
Oh yeah?

437
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,098
Yeah.

438
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,465
Well, you owe me
two hours it took me

439
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:37,832
to find your drunk ass passed
out on the fucking dock.

440
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,199
And then you owe me
another half hour

441
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,320
it took me to drag
your drunk ass

442
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,437
back to this fucking frozen car

443
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,157
that you left me in.

444
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:44,875
And then it took me two hours

445
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,593
to walk to the nearest
fucking gas station

446
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:48,311
and it took me two
hours to walk back.

447
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:50,847
Are we done?

448
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,884
Yeah, I get the gist.

449
00:35:58,457 --> 00:35:59,789
We're almost in.

450
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,191
Can't stay here.

451
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,893
Why not?

452
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,594
Fucking GI Joe in there
says no dogs allowed.

453
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,695
I already checked
three other motels

454
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,564
and they all said the same shit.

455
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:08,932
You serious?

456
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,299
Let's think of something later.

457
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:13,937
Can't afford to waste
no more time up here.

458
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,438
Where you going?

459
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,574
I'm gonna talk to him.

460
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,781
Told you he was an asshole.

461
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,600
There's a Bed and
Breakfast up the road.

462
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,418
It's the only place in
town that allows dogs.

463
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,486
Where'd you hear that?

464
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:30,720
The guy just told me.

465
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,289
The guy in there?

466
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,557
Yeah, who else?

467
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,824
Well how'd you get
him to tell you that?

468
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,593
I asked him.

469
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,195
You don't think I asked him?

470
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,863
Yeah, well you tend to be

471
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,530
a little fucking
abrasive sometimes.

472
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,666
You should try
listening to people.

473
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,534
See how it suits ya.

474
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:03,887
What's the breakfast look like?

475
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,926
Here is dog.

476
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,361
Maybe God sent that.

477
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,230
No, I'm all right.

478
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,299
All right.

479
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:19,302
Tell me if you
want anything else.

480
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,609
So what's next?

481
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,244
Huh?

482
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,746
What are we doin'?

483
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,247
Where we goin', how we
finding Billy Burke?

484
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:31,965
None of that, settle down,

485
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,682
you're giving me a headache.

486
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,253
Derek, I didn't come
here to no fucking cereal

487
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,821
in the bum's backyard.

488
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,056
What's the plan?

489
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,290
We're gonna make a plan.

490
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,524
That's what we're doin',
we're brainstorming.

491
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,953
Brainstorming?

492
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:44,381
- Yeah, brainstorming.
- Brainstorming?

493
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:45,809
I'm gonna drown this hangover.

494
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,237
We're gonna eat our breakfast

495
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:48,665
and we're gonna
come up with a plan.

496
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,000
Right now, together.

497
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:52,802
So shut up and eat your cereal.

498
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,805
It's soggy.

499
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,541
Well that's no good.

500
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,553
All right, so we're up here.

501
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,455
Now what?

502
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,723
We find Burke.

503
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,025
Good.

504
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:16,426
How?

505
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,826
Well we start by
leaving this shit hole

506
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,297
and start looking for him.

507
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,833
All right, you wanna
wing it, we'll wing it.

508
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,252
I figured you'd
wanna make a plan

509
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:26,670
since you're the one
sitting here bitching

510
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,571
about breakfast and everything.

511
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,907
You thought I want some
god damn cold cereal, Derek?

512
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,977
I mean fucking I didn't
think it was that bad.

513
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,579
Quit wasting time, let's go.

514
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,827
Do you remember
what he looks like?

515
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,595
I think I'd know
him if I seen him.

516
00:38:58,437 --> 00:38:59,703
And I won't.

517
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,405
I'm gonna poke around a bit.

518
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,940
All right.

519
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,098
Excuse me, can I
get a beer, please?

520
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:40,810
Thank you.

521
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,396
How much?

522
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,401
Mind if I sit?

523
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,704
I'm not gonna be here long.

524
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,939
Yeah, me ah, me either.

525
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,144
I'm only in town
for a day or two.

526
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:15,512
Hmm, that's so?

527
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:16,514
Mm-hmm.

528
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:25,021
What brings you into town?

529
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,825
Just checking out the spots.

530
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,429
I like this one.

531
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,630
In this spot?

532
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,964
What's to like?

533
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,700
I don't know.

534
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,105
Something about it.

535
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,747
Basically, there's just a
bunch of bars around here.

536
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,116
There's a bowling
alley down the road,

537
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,018
but that's about it.

538
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,954
Bowling alley,
which way do I head?

539
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:31,821
Like down that way.

540
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,156
That way.

541
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,490
Take a left, you can't miss it.

542
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,660
I'll ah, I'll have
to check it out.

543
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:40,898
Derek.

544
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,132
He ain't here.

545
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,204
It was nice talking to you, uh?

546
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,205
Shannon.

547
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:52,192
Nice talking to you, Shannon.

548
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,790
I didn't order anything.

549
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:39,882
We should head back to that bar.

550
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,753
No sense in waste those clothes.

551
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,090
I'll drive if you want.

552
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:55,198
Why you ask me to
come up here, man?

553
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,716
Huh?

554
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,233
You heard what I said.

555
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,171
You need the money,
I'm looking out for you.

556
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:03,840
You ain't looking out for me.

557
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,759
If you came up
here to find Burke,

558
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,677
you wouldn't have spent the
last 36 hours fucking around.

559
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,314
I only got two more
to find the money.

560
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,805
I told you from the beginning.

561
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:14,295
I said it's a long shot.

562
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:15,785
You knew I had no choice.

563
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,186
Tell you what, I'm only
here for one more day,

564
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,688
then I'm going back home.

565
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,189
How you gonna find the money
if you're back in Boston?

566
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,991
It doesn't matter.

567
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,662
At least I won't be
here wasting my time.

568
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,700
All right.

569
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,040
Here's what's gonna happen.

570
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:40,810
I'm going out tonight
and when I come back,

571
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,812
I'm gonna have a plan.

572
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:44,681
Once I have that plan,

573
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,683
we're gonna make you that money.

574
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:47,685
All right?

575
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,722
Trust me, I got this.

576
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:04,801
Jesus.

577
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:11,340
That's a lot of chicken.

578
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:14,811
Yeah well, I figure
if I don't eat 'em,

579
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:17,046
then they died for
nothing, right?

580
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,314
Yeah, maybe.

581
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,217
You want some?

582
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,852
No, sir, man.

583
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,053
You sure?

584
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,253
I ain't gonna eat
'em, so might as well.

585
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,890
No, really, thank you, man.

586
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,095
You wanna a beer?

587
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:37,100
Eh, no, I really shouldn't.

588
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,268
You shouldn't, why not?

589
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,272
Heh, my fiance
got me on this diet.

590
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:44,724
It's torture, man.

591
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:46,175
I've been eating
salad and smoothie

592
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:49,245
for the past month and a half.

593
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,314
Just here for the game.

594
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,783
What kind of diet?

595
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,184
One of those low-calorie diets?

596
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:58,054
Low-calorie, low-carb, no fun.

597
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,390
All right, I got you, man.

598
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:04,861
Hey, can I get
some vodka down here?

599
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:08,030
Low-calorie.

600
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,404
So then I look them
all square in the face

601
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:18,007
and I say, if any of you
come near me tonight,

602
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,909
I'll stab you in
the fucking chest.

603
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:22,044
And they believed you?

604
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:23,813
Yeah, I meant it.

605
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:26,115
Can't let 'em walk all
over you like that.

606
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,750
Sometimes you got to
break a broomstick

607
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,384
and act like a fucking nut case.

608
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,454
All right, tough guy.

609
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,093
Last call, gentlemen.

610
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,063
All right, I'm gonna
head to the bathroom.

611
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:43,166
I'll alert the media.

612
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:17,400
What's that?

613
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,570
This?

614
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:21,572
It's beer.

615
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,874
Where's mine?

616
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,108
Yours?

617
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,510
Gotta order one.

618
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,112
I got to order one?

619
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:31,514
Yeah.

620
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,915
That's how it works, isn't it?

621
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:36,052
You order a beer,
they give you one.

622
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,707
That's funny 'cause the,

623
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:44,392
the last four times I ordered
a shot, they gave me two.

624
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:47,930
Pretty sure they charged me
for each of them as well.

625
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,399
Every time I ordered two
shots and paid for two shots,

626
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:53,069
I slid on of them
in your direction.

627
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,071
Yeah.

628
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,205
Thanks.

629
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,725
No problem, what
I'm gettin' at is

630
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:01,244
I bought you four
shots just now.

631
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:03,880
I heard what you said.

632
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:07,617
Good, then you see how this
seems a little fucking rude.

633
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,418
I don't know what
you're talking about.

634
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,771
You think this is right?

635
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:14,447
I duck out for two
seconds, I come back

636
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:16,123
and you bought yourself a
drink and didn't get me one.

637
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,094
I didn't ask you to
buy me four drinks, bro.

638
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:19,195
You didn't have to ask, bro.

639
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:21,964
That's what I'm talking about.

640
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,165
Do you want a drink?

641
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,101
I'll buy you a drink.

642
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:27,436
Don't talk to me like I'm
begging you for something.

643
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,372
It's common fucking courtesy.

644
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,274
All right, all
right, sweetheart.

645
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,109
You want a drink,
I'll buy you a drink.

646
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,511
So now you're gonna be a
fucking smart ass about it?

647
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,713
I'm just buying you a drink.

648
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:37,914
Isn't that what you wanted?

649
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:41,784
You know what?

650
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,251
I don't want your fucking drink.

651
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,188
Then what are you crying about?

652
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,459
This one's on me.

653
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,330
Drink it.

654
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:09,979
Thanks.

655
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,180
Don't thank me.

656
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:13,649
It's common fucking courtesy.

657
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,690
Fucking cheap ass, Derek.

658
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:23,192
Got me all the way out
here in these fucking woods

659
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,727
cleaning up all
this fucking beer

660
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:27,363
this motherfucker done drunk.

661
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,099
Fuck.

662
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:39,376
Hush.

663
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:47,283
Oh, shit.

664
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,551
Derek.

665
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,052
Sadie.

666
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,054
Sadie.

667
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:07,671
Sorry.

668
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:09,638
For what?

669
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:12,675
I don't know.

670
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,680
Well you gonna come and sit down

671
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,683
or are you just
gonna stand there?

672
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:28,090
You're pretty good at that.

673
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:29,092
I know.

674
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,197
So you always go around
pulling guns on people?

675
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,766
I wasn't gonna hurt him,

676
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:38,334
I was just gonna scare him.

677
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:39,786
He was being a prick.

678
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,237
Yeah, well he's
always been a prick.

679
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,638
We went to school together
when we were kids.

680
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,473
Oh yeah?

681
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,307
Yeah, his family owns the
only decent asian restaurant

682
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,977
in 60 miles though.

683
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,645
It's one of the ones that they
cook food in front of you.

684
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,680
It's a hibachi place?

685
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,816
Yeah, whatever it is, it's good.

686
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:55,151
I don't go there though.

687
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,552
His whole family is ass holes.

688
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,454
Yeah, I believe it.

689
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,125
This is little Shannon?

690
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:04,727
Mm-hmm.

691
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,365
That your dad with you?

692
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:13,636
This is his place?

693
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,071
It was.

694
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,205
Oh, sorry.

695
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,608
He's not dead, he's just sick.

696
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,212
Dementia, he's at an assisted
living place down the road.

697
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,513
Dementia, that's like uh,

698
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:26,115
that's like Alzheimers, right?

699
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:27,450
They're basically
the same thing,

700
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,218
but you can't be
diagnosed with Alzheimer

701
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,786
until after you're
dead, so until,

702
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,622
they say you have dementia.

703
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:34,490
Sorry to hear that.

704
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:35,624
It's okay.

705
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,130
So this is your place?

706
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:42,732
Mm-hmm.

707
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,333
I have the mortgage
bills to prove it.

708
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,718
That sucks.

709
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,102
Yeah, it does.

710
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:48,170
Cops get a decent
pension though, right?

711
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:49,655
That's got to help.

712
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:51,139
That doesn't even cover
his assisted living.

713
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:52,575
No?

714
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,009
What do you do to
pay for it all?

715
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,443
I'm a Dental Hygienist.

716
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,645
No you're not.

717
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,647
Yeah I am.

718
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,449
I knew there had to be
something wrong with you.

719
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,250
You have a problem
with dental hygienists?

720
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,253
It's not the, it's
the whole teeth thing,

721
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,654
showing my teeth
kinda freaks me out.

722
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:07,656
Oh my God, you're
one of those people.

723
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:09,592
What's that suppose to mean?

724
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,527
Nothing, I just think
you're a bit of a wimp.

725
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,395
I'm not a wimp,
but I just don't like

726
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:15,364
when people mess
around with my teeth.

727
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,666
What about the dentist?

728
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,135
You don't go to the dentist?

729
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:20,903
Never.

730
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,670
That's horrible, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

731
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:24,473
I brush my teeth
everyday, I'm not filthy.

732
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,610
I just like to do it on my own.

733
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:28,677
Open your mouth.

734
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:29,728
Why?

735
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,778
Just do it.

736
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:31,747
What are you gonna do to me?

737
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:32,681
Nothin'.

738
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:35,551
I don't trust you.

739
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,420
Come on, quit being a
pussy and open your mouth.

740
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,259
Looks fine.

741
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:45,327
That's it, I'm good to go?

742
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,846
Mm-hmm.

743
00:52:46,847 --> 00:52:48,364
That's the dental
hygienist stamp of approval?

744
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,700
That's why they
pay me the big bucks.

745
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,273
I'm gonna go get some coke.

746
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:58,641
Do you want some?

747
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,743
Ah, I'm good with this for now.

748
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:01,745
Thanks.

749
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,872
This ah, is this
Old Orchard Beach?

750
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,407
Uh, probably.

751
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:35,077
I used to love this
place when I was a kid.

752
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,412
They use to have this big
carnival up at the 4th of July.

753
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,515
Oh yeah, we used
to go there for that.

754
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:40,382
Really?

755
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,367
Mm-hmm.

756
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:42,351
Oh shit.

757
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,054
What?

758
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,756
Nothing, I just, I
thought you meant, you know.

759
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:51,227
You thought I meant
like coke, coke.

760
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,729
Uh, yeah.

761
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,733
It's funny how that
doesn't happen more often.

762
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,235
Yeah, I guess.

763
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,937
Well, I'm sorry, I didn't mean

764
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,638
to freak you out or anything.

765
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,140
No, that's fine.

766
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,641
I just wasn't expecting
it, that's all.

767
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,276
So you don't mind if I?

768
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:09,278
No, that's cool, I really,

769
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,279
it doesn't matter, I just, it
caught me a little off guard.

770
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:12,815
Well, okay then.

771
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:18,420
Do you ever do blow?

772
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:21,624
Ah, I used to a bit,

773
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:26,662
but my ex wasn't big
into that kind of stuff,

774
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,299
so I kind of gave it up for her.

775
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,805
You always do what
people tell you?

776
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:53,555
What was your name again?

777
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:54,557
Eddie.

778
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:58,827
That's a good name.

779
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,730
I'm Pat.

780
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,603
You like my name?

781
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:12,474
Yeah, I mean sure, I guess so.

782
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,844
Eh, I never liked
it, too, too plain.

783
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,949
Now my brother
had a better name.

784
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,955
Here.

785
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,089
Nah, I'm all right, man.

786
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,461
You do this often?

787
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:36,699
Most nights.

788
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,002
Why?

789
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:42,104
I like it.

790
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:45,474
I like space.

791
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,846
You like space?

792
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,350
I guess so.

793
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:58,387
You know I really don't
know much about it though.

794
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:01,423
Nobody knows much
about anything.

795
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,497
What's that one right there?

796
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:11,367
That's the North Star, isn't it?

797
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,369
Good.

798
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:15,371
It's Polaris.

799
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,606
Polaris?

800
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:20,776
Yeah, for now,
it's the North Star.

801
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:27,049
But the purpose
of the North Star

802
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,751
is that it's always
the same star.

803
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,652
It's always in the
same place, right?

804
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:35,090
Sailors use it like a,
like a compass, right?

805
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:36,925
That sort of thing.

806
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,896
It's been the same
for 5,000 years,

807
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:46,402
but before that it
was a different one.

808
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:51,740
And another one before that
and another one before that.

809
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,478
13,000 years from now,
it'll change again

810
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,450
and again and again and again.

811
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:06,522
How far does that go on?

812
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:08,425
Forever.

813
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,096
My brother liked space.

814
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:20,502
That's how you got into it, huh?

815
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:34,583
How, how did your brother die?

816
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,719
If you don't mind me asking.

817
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,758
He died in a fire.

818
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,605
You remember what you did?

819
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,878
What do you mean?

820
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:06,148
I mean like how,

821
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,219
I mean how'd you get over it?

822
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:20,062
You don't get
over things like that.

823
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,920
Batman, peanut butter?

824
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:46,788
Nine eleven.

825
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,158
Nine eleven?

826
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,527
Okay, shut up, you're
not allowed to talk.

827
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,533
All right.

828
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,872
Stevie Nicks?

829
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:04,940
Rain dance?

830
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:07,276
Seizure?

831
00:59:07,278 --> 00:59:09,244
I don't wanna do this any more.

832
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:11,079
Oh come on.

833
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,181
You just, you're
not even trying.

834
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:13,282
You're making me stand up here

835
00:59:13,284 --> 00:59:15,083
and I look like an idiot.

836
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,051
This ain't, this
ain't fun for me.

837
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,686
What?

838
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,290
It's embarrassing.

839
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:22,891
You were doing so good though.

840
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,160
Don't patronize me,
you're making it worse.

841
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:26,828
Fine.

842
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,332
Patronize sound
like patron eyes,

843
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,801
like the eyes of a patron.

844
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:36,171
No one ever talks about that.

845
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:40,208
Probably because
it's not interesting.

846
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,211
What word did you have any ways?

847
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:46,715
I don't wanna tell you.

848
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:47,716
Squid?

849
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:48,751
Leave me alone.

850
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:49,785
Have you ever even seen a squid?

851
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:50,819
Leave me alone.

852
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,991
I think I'm gonna
head up to bed soon.

853
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:58,060
Yeah.

854
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,128
Mm-hmm, you can crash on
the couch though, if you want.

855
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,446
The couch?

856
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:02,763
After what you just
put me through?

857
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,132
That's right.

858
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:07,135
It's a comfy couch though.

859
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:09,137
It is a comfy couch.

860
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,874
What time is it any way?

861
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:14,176
Aw, shit.

862
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,711
What's wrong?

863
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:18,280
Ah, nothing, it
just I told my friend

864
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,948
I'd come back with a plan.

865
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,350
Plan for what?

866
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:25,487
He needs money.

867
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,222
I told him that I might
be able to get him some,

868
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:31,226
but doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

869
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:33,095
That sucks.

870
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:34,096
Yeah.

871
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:38,033
He'll probably fucking
disown me after this.

872
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,838
Well too bad you can't
call your buddy from the bar.

873
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:45,408
Who?

874
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,645
Peter Cheung, the Asian guy.

875
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:52,247
What about him?

876
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,833
Well, he's rich.

877
01:00:54,834 --> 01:00:57,418
I don't know if he is rich,
but his family's rich.

878
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:59,855
I thought you said his
family owned a hibachi place.

879
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:02,057
Yeah, like five
other businesses.

880
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:06,328
They have more money that
they know what to do with.

881
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:11,333
You wanna rob a hibachi place?

882
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,979
Just shut up and
hear me out, all right?

883
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,624
The guy who owns this place
is a local fucking monopoly.

884
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,269
He's got six businesses
and he stashes all the cash

885
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:17,339
in his office at the restaurant.

886
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,696
And how do you know this?

887
01:01:18,697 --> 01:01:20,052
A friend of mine
used to work at his a,

888
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:21,408
at his flower shop when
she was in high school.

889
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:22,778
What friend?

890
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,145
Nevermind, what friend.

891
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:25,512
Look, she said that when she
worked in the flower shop,

892
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:26,879
she used to make daily
runs to the hibachi place

893
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:29,485
'cause the guy keeps the
cash from all six businesses

894
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:32,087
stashed in the, in a safe
in the back office there.

895
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:33,655
You wanna tell me what the fuck

896
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,222
that is over there?

897
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,247
That's the get away car.

898
01:01:38,248 --> 01:01:39,301
The get away car?

899
01:01:39,302 --> 01:01:40,355
Yeah, the get away car.

900
01:01:40,356 --> 01:01:41,409
You wanna tell me
where the fuck is the car

901
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,463
we're suppose to drive home in?

902
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,559
It's at my friend's place.

903
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,653
- What friend?
- Nevermind what friend.

904
01:01:44,654 --> 01:01:45,747
You and that shit.

905
01:01:45,748 --> 01:01:46,841
What does that have
to do with anything?

906
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:47,935
Look, I got this thing
at the junk yard.

907
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,556
It was 500 bucks plus
200 to fix the engine,

908
01:01:50,557 --> 01:01:53,175
but we'll talk about that
after we hit the restaurant.

909
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:56,078
If we hurry, we can go now

910
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,079
while they're getting
ready to open.

911
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,616
What about Billy Burke?

912
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:01,984
Fuck Billy Burke,
it's like you said,

913
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,352
we're never gonna find that guy.

914
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:04,720
I mean you need, you
need the money, right?

915
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,071
You need the money, you said
I come back with a plan,

916
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:07,421
this is what I got for you.

917
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:10,792
What do you say?

918
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:37,713
Hands up.

919
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:39,081
- I don't know, I don't know,
- Open the fucking safe.

920
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,449
- The code man.
- What do you mean

921
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,817
you don't know the fucking code?

922
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,272
- Its my dads.
- That's a fucking lie.

923
01:03:43,273 --> 01:03:44,726
Fuck you're fucking dad.

924
01:03:44,727 --> 01:03:46,180
Put the fucking
money in the bag.

925
01:03:46,181 --> 01:03:47,634
- I don't know the code, man.
- Put the fucking money

926
01:03:47,635 --> 01:03:49,088
in the bag!

927
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:51,426
What's going on out here?

928
01:03:53,271 --> 01:03:54,312
Oh shit.

929
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:55,354
Shit, shit.

930
01:03:55,355 --> 01:03:56,715
I knew that
fucking, I knew that...

931
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,236
Eddie, you okay?

932
01:04:01,238 --> 01:04:03,839
Don't say my
fucking name, dumb ass.

933
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,683
I leave you just two fucking

934
01:04:13,123 --> 01:04:13,729
seconds this is what happens.

935
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:14,336
She's got a
fucking shotgun, Derek.

936
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:14,943
Yeah, I noticed.

937
01:04:14,944 --> 01:04:16,157
Eddie: You see that
bitch is got to a gun.

938
01:04:16,158 --> 01:04:16,764
What do you think I gave her.

939
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:17,371
Fucking pistol?

940
01:04:17,372 --> 01:04:17,978
She's got guns, how
is this my fault?

941
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:19,763
All right, let's go, let's go.

942
01:04:19,764 --> 01:04:21,539
Let's do it on three, ready?

943
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,315
Three.

944
01:04:23,316 --> 01:04:25,091
That wasn't three.

945
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:40,308
I didn't get the safe.

946
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,281
Fucking, the kid
didn't know the code

947
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:48,583
and then all the
shooting started,

948
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:52,120
so I didn't have time
to figure it out.

949
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:26,454
What'd you get
from the register?

950
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:28,256
A couple hundred.

951
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:33,094
It's all coming
together white car.

952
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,197
You think it's a
fucking joke, don't you?

953
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,599
Just trying to lighten the mood.

954
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,601
You trying to lighten
the fucking mood.

955
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,602
That's what you were trying
to do this whole time,

956
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,603
trying to lighten the
fucking mood, huh, huh?

957
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,473
It was a joke all
right, I'm sorry.

958
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,943
You ain't sorry, so don't
fucking at like it, Derek.

959
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:49,311
Oh so, now you
what I'm thinking?

960
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:50,612
You ain't sorry, Derek.

961
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,614
You fucked up is what you are.

962
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,115
You've been drunk since
before we left Boston,

963
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,283
and now you fucking snort coke

964
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,618
in a fucking catering truck.

965
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,086
Is there a point
you're trying to get at

966
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,553
or are we just talking shit now?

967
01:05:59,554 --> 01:06:01,020
My point is you
got to a fucking problem

968
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:02,190
and it's starting to affect...

969
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:03,658
That's my fucking point.

970
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,193
Oh, I got a problem?

971
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,727
Yes, you got a fucking problem.

972
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,029
And what about you, huh?

973
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:09,164
What's your excuse?

974
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,433
I'm fucked up, okay.

975
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,535
And what about you?

976
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:14,937
'Cause as far as I can remember

977
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:16,338
I haven't forced you to do shit.

978
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,962
You chose to come up with me

979
01:06:17,963 --> 01:06:19,585
and you chose to come
with me this morning,

980
01:06:19,586 --> 01:06:21,208
so don't fucking try to pin
it all on me when it's...

981
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,911
there's something in your head

982
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,612
making you make those choices.

983
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,352
Holy shit.

984
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,520
What the fuck was that?

985
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,391
How far is the car?

986
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:41,129
About five miles that way.

987
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,202
Where you going?

988
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,274
Where you going?

989
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:56,244
I need a minute.

990
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:58,046
For what?

991
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,686
I'm gonna pick up the car.

992
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:07,155
Call me when you're ready.

993
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,696
You all right?

994
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,544
Well look who it is.

995
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,713
There you are.

996
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:40,782
I was wondering where
you took off to.

997
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,118
I went to see my father.

998
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,319
Yeah?

999
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:45,321
How is he?

1000
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:53,728
Hi.

1001
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,730
Hey.

1002
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:57,232
You all right?

1003
01:08:57,234 --> 01:08:58,833
What do you mean?

1004
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,703
I mean you almost did
a face plant just then.

1005
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:04,539
Ah, it's just
these stupid boots,

1006
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:07,408
they're real hard to balance in.

1007
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,548
I smoked a bag of
fuel on my way home.

1008
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,150
Oh, all right.

1009
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:18,219
Where you headed?

1010
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:21,289
Uh, I was thinking
about heading home.

1011
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,290
Home?

1012
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:25,727
Yeah, my friend's been
having gone with a rough time

1013
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:28,563
and well I'm up here on a
bit of a wild goose chase,

1014
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:32,367
so I figure I should
probably get him back.

1015
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,170
Look, I'd rather stay here
and hang out with you,

1016
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,173
I just, I got to
run, head into town

1017
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,707
and pick up a few things
before we hit the road,

1018
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:40,842
so I'm sorry.

1019
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,277
It's, it's, it's all good.

1020
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,444
I understand.

1021
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:51,252
You wanna a, you
wanna come with me?

1022
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,453
Come where?

1023
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:54,322
Into town.

1024
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,457
You want me to come?

1025
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:57,870
Ah, yeah if you want.

1026
01:09:57,871 --> 01:09:59,282
I just got to run by the place

1027
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:00,694
we've been staying
and pick up the dog.

1028
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,364
I won't be able to
give you a ride back.

1029
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,083
Not cause I'm lazy
or I don't want to,

1030
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:06,801
I just, I don't know
what time, you know,

1031
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:08,336
my friend's gonna call
me and I'm gonna have to

1032
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:10,405
go pick him up and
I don't wanna say

1033
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:11,639
I'm gonna give you a ride now

1034
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:13,341
and not be able to do it.

1035
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:15,343
It's a, you know,
I was actually gonna

1036
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:17,979
go into town anyway,
so it works out.

1037
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:19,581
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1038
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:23,686
Ah, shit.

1039
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:26,047
What's wrong?

1040
01:10:26,048 --> 01:10:27,341
It's just you're not suppose

1041
01:10:27,342 --> 01:10:28,635
to keep this out of
the cold for too long.

1042
01:10:28,636 --> 01:10:29,929
Do you mind if I throw
it in your freezer

1043
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,223
when we get there?

1044
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,261
Ah, sure, what is it?

1045
01:10:33,263 --> 01:10:35,863
I already told you, it's PCP.

1046
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:39,133
When the hell did
you tell me that?

1047
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:41,401
I told you I smoked a
bag of fuel on my way home.

1048
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:42,670
That's what fuel is?

1049
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:45,273
Yeah, what did you think it was?

1050
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:46,641
I don't know, I thought
you meant weed or something,

1051
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,876
I didn't think fuel was PCP.

1052
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,278
I didn't even know that
shit was still around.

1053
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,769
Yeah, it isn't.

1054
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,259
You've got to drive all the
way down in New York City

1055
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,749
and go into to
Harlan to pick it up.

1056
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:59,354
I know a guy who makes a
trip every couple weeks.

1057
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:01,389
So, um, do you
mind if I throw it

1058
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:04,692
in your freezer
when we get there?

1059
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,563
Ah.

1060
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:09,697
Nah, go for it, I guess.

1061
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:21,402
And it's not,
god, it's not like that.

1062
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,640
You're totally tripping
out over nothing.

1063
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:28,776
Like we can talk
being out tomorrow.

1064
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:30,778
It's my dad.

1065
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,518
I know, I know it
wasn't cool, I know.

1066
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:39,754
No, I'm not high.

1067
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,357
Ah, shut up.

1068
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,127
Dude, you're like, just...

1069
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:47,612
I can't talk right now.

1070
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,096
I can't do this shit right now.

1071
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:51,866
I got too much on my,
on my plate, dude.

1072
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:54,068
You got to go, I got to go.

1073
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:57,405
Yeah, fuck off.

1074
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:04,612
You hear from your friend?

1075
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:05,913
Nah, not yet.

1076
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:10,051
Something wrong?

1077
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:13,454
Nah, it's just this guy.

1078
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:17,792
We used to date.

1079
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:19,026
Kinda, but...

1080
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:24,532
We're suppose to meet up

1081
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,666
and smoke the rest of
this bag later, but.

1082
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:28,436
You don't wanna?

1083
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:29,771
I don't know.

1084
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,940
He can just be real
creepy sometimes

1085
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,411
and I don't know if I
wanna hang out with him

1086
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:38,479
when I'm all fucked up.

1087
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,634
Then don't go.

1088
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:45,153
Well, I mean I don't know,
it might not be that bad.

1089
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:48,556
I don't wanna smoke
it all by myself.

1090
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:53,060
You wanna, you
wanna smoke it here?

1091
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,863
Really, you don't mind?

1092
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,865
No, it's cool.

1093
01:13:57,867 --> 01:13:58,867
Okay.

1094
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,113
Thank you, man, you're
a real lifesaver.

1095
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,682
This guy's a real weirdo.

1096
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:15,917
Last time I hung out with him,

1097
01:14:15,919 --> 01:14:17,652
he spotted me some money for gas

1098
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:19,554
and that just means that
the next time I see him,

1099
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:22,824
he's gonna try to swing that
in some weird favor, you know.

1100
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:25,827
You know like we didn't
even do anything crazy ever.

1101
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:29,096
He just, he's always
trying something.

1102
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:33,901
We only dated for
like a minute and...

1103
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,102
I don't know.

1104
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:39,140
It's just real
annoying to be around.

1105
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:18,113
Thank you.

1106
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:25,186
Hey, be careful.

1107
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,188
Oh shit, sorry.

1108
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,257
Now what were we talking about?

1109
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:32,093
Oh, yeah, that, that douche bag,

1110
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:33,961
yeah, he's a weirdo.

1111
01:15:35,999 --> 01:15:38,566
You ever been on
a duck boat tour?

1112
01:15:38,568 --> 01:15:42,069
Ah, nah, I've seen
'em around though.

1113
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,804
Yeah, one time my
dad brought me up,

1114
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,873
out to Boston on one of
those duck boat tours

1115
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,809
and I really wanted
to see the ducks

1116
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:49,911
and ah, I didn't know there was

1117
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:52,647
some floating car tour, so ah,

1118
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:56,851
you can imagine I
was pretty pis...

1119
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,286
Shannon, watch out.

1120
01:15:58,288 --> 01:16:00,688
Relax, man, she's fine.

1121
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:05,726
I mean people always feel
like they got to say something

1122
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,995
or they got to do
something, do something,

1123
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:09,030
we're like no.

1124
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,165
Ah, do something when
people say things

1125
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:14,802
or a, they don't, people
don't think to think

1126
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:16,604
to think about themselves.

1127
01:16:16,606 --> 01:16:17,972
Hey, come on, you're
gonna hurt Sadie.

1128
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:18,873
You can't sit there.

1129
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:19,807
Can't sit where?

1130
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:20,900
In the chair.

1131
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:21,992
What chair?

1132
01:16:21,993 --> 01:16:23,084
The one you were
just sitting in.

1133
01:16:23,085 --> 01:16:24,176
It's yours?

1134
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,846
Let's go for a walk somewhere.

1135
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:28,082
You can't tell me what to do.

1136
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,500
What?

1137
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,917
What are you a
dictator or something?

1138
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,055
What are you,
what are you saying?

1139
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:37,291
Derek, Derek, Derek, Der.

1140
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:46,001
I'm stuck.

1141
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,856
I'm stuck.

1142
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:52,857
Are you fucking with me?

1143
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:00,782
Shannon.

1144
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,587
I don't wanna be stuck.

1145
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,054
Am I gonna be stuck?

1146
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:09,924
This looks horrible.

1147
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,059
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1148
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:14,161
Ah, aah, what the fuck?

1149
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:26,974
Okay, Sh, Shannon, I'm gonna,

1150
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,976
I'm gonna unstick you.

1151
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,391
Okay, on three.

1152
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:47,061
One, two, three.

1153
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,199
Fuck.

1154
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:54,935
Shannon, Shannon,
Sha, Sha, Shannon.

1155
01:17:58,741 --> 01:17:59,857
Fuck.

1156
01:17:59,858 --> 01:18:00,974
Come on, Shannon, Shannon.

1157
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:02,811
Shannon.

1158
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:17,479
Yo.

1159
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:23,918
Slow down, what happened?

1160
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:56,076
You can still catch
the end of it.

1161
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:59,580
No, I just wanna
sit here a bit longer.

1162
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:14,695
I've been thinking about
what you said the other day.

1163
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:16,096
About what?

1164
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:20,935
About eternity.

1165
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,406
I don't know why the
fuck you listen to me for.

1166
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,174
I don't what the fuck
I'm talking about.

1167
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,944
No, man, what if she's right?

1168
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:35,449
What if this is all there is?

1169
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,485
And there's just nothing.

1170
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:45,259
I guess that mean every
second you spent with her

1171
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:47,661
means that much more, right?

1172
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:11,251
You know, the North Star
wasn't always the North Star?

1173
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:18,392
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1174
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:22,663
North Star, it changes
every couple thousand years.

1175
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,168
Before we had this one,
there was another one,

1176
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,405
and before that one,
there was another one.

1177
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:35,376
In a couple thousand years,
there'll be another one.

1178
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:38,779
It's gonna keep going
like that forever.

1179
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:41,682
Both directions.

1180
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:48,155
What does that have
to do with anything?

1181
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,594
So you can talk about this shit,

1182
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,495
you got to realize that
the amount of time

1183
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,664
we got is so fucking
small, it's microscopic,

1184
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:00,434
it's smaller than that, it's...

1185
01:24:01,737 --> 01:24:04,738
We're talking about
infinity, man.

1186
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,777
So what are you saying,

1187
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:12,112
that a, we're so fucking
small and insignificant

1188
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:13,430
that none of this
really matters?

1189
01:24:13,431 --> 01:24:14,747
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That's what it

1190
01:24:14,748 --> 01:24:16,064
- sounds like.
- That's not what the fuck

1191
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:17,381
- I said, I'm not saying that.
- And it ain't fucking helping

1192
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,386
- me out right now.
- Well, I'm not saying that.

1193
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,387
It just not what I'm saying.

1194
01:24:21,388 --> 01:24:23,388
I'm saying that we're
only here for a moment

1195
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:28,562
and every part of that moment

1196
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:34,101
is specific to a certain
place and a certain time.

1197
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:36,603
It's not that we don't matter,

1198
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:40,741
it's the opposite, it's
every second of our life

1199
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:46,513
no matter how small,
no matter how painful,

1200
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:50,217
every second is special.

1201
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,457
Every second is one in infinity.

1202
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:34,261
Got any ideas?

1203
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:38,799
I was kinda
hoping you had something.

1204
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,567
Well, maybe we'll get
her a gift together,

1205
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,453
but it's got to be a
good one or she'll think

1206
01:25:42,454 --> 01:25:44,338
we got lazy and screwed
her out of her present.

1207
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,405
Isn't that what's happening?

1208
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:47,708
Not if it's a good one.

1209
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,176
How 'bout we get
her a gift card?

1210
01:25:49,178 --> 01:25:51,245
No, we can't get
her a gift card.

1211
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:53,313
We get her a gift card, we
might as well get her cash,

1212
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,381
you get her cash you might as
well get her nothing at all.

1213
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:56,550
How 'bout one of those
elliptical machines

1214
01:25:56,552 --> 01:25:58,352
she's been talking about?

1215
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:00,153
No, she'll make me use it.

1216
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:03,157
You know what?

1217
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,558
We can get her one of
those, one of those vacuums

1218
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,527
that cleans the floor by itself.

1219
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:07,628
Those exist?

1220
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:08,728
Yeah, they got 'em
at the department store

1221
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:09,828
down the road.

1222
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,299
What time they open til?

1223
01:26:15,204 --> 01:26:16,703
About another half hour.

1224
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:22,093
That a good idea.

1225
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,595
Why don't you run up
there and grab one.

1226
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:25,846
And when you're done,
swing by and pick me up.

1227
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,214
You sure?

1228
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:28,581
Mom hasn't been letting
me drive the couple weeks.

1229
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:30,251
No, I trust you.

1230
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:31,919
Just pick me up
when you're done.

1231
01:26:31,921 --> 01:26:33,320
Thanks dad.

1232
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:42,296
What can I get for you?

1233
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:44,464
Newports.

1234
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,677
Any thing else?
