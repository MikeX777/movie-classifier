1
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,338
A fine piece of property.
With a little work and attention ..

2
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:58,016
Too bad to see it go for a song, sir.

3
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:00,738
Too bad for Hugh Dawltry, I say.

4
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,613
Yes. The Gymkhana Club.

5
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:32,747
Not at all my, dear Reginald.
Not at all. It's this way you see.

6
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:36,088
But Simpson, old fellow.
I told you I did not see.

7
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:40,416
But my dear Reginald, you must see.
- But how can I see when I don't see?

8
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,378
That is just the point.
If you did, you could.

9
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:45,780
But I told you I didn't, old fellow.

10
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:51,465
Anyone about?
- Hello, Wey-Smith.

11
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,633
We're going to be officially rid
of that bounder Dawltry at last.

12
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:58,354
The poor devil will be
only a memory soon.

13
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,715
And a jolly bad one.

14
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,699
He should have been expelled
from the club long ago.

15
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,058
Rules, my dear Everard. Rules.

16
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,417
This country is a stickler for rules.
- And honour, old fellow.

17
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:11,815
Without it none of us could live
in this beastly climate, what?

18
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:13,756
Stuffy in here, eh?

19
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:16,142
Hey there.

20
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:17,526
Punkah-wallah.

21
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,968
That's better.
- What's the difference?

22
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,165
It doesn't cool off this
climate to keep it moving.

23
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:27,815
A Scotch and soda might.

24
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,271
How about it?
- Yes.

25
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:32,771
A Scotch and soda.
- Twice.

26
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,628
Seen the evening paper?

27
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,538
Same as yesterdays, isn't it?
- All except the shipping news.

28
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:39,868
What's new about that?

29
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:42,395
Nobody but cooks,
tourists and missionaries ..

30
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,409
Would be foolish enough to stick
their heads into this furnace.

31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,886
Well, I'd hardly call Hugh
Dawltry a missionary.

32
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,990
Dawltry?
- That's the gentleman.

33
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,320
There is his name on the
next boat's passenger list.

34
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,937
Coming back to Khota?

35
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,883
He wouldn't have the crust.

36
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:00,144
I can't believe that is true.

37
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:03,247
He had crust enough to say
this place is an old ladies' home.

38
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,074
And to say it right to our faces.

39
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,794
Why didn't he keep out of it then?

40
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,634
He did, most of the time.

41
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,878
He seemed to like the homes of
the younger ladies much better.

42
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:15,499
A man who won't respect the moral
code down here doesn't belong.

43
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:19,284
There's no law against stealing other
men's wives if they want to be stolen.

44
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,687
But you don't have to
associate with the thief.

45
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,877
He made that plain enough
before he cleared out.

46
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:27,783
It deserves a drink.
This unexpected homecoming.

47
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,370
I wonder what he came back for.

48
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,487
That plantation of his probably.

49
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:35,327
A stubborn fellow, Dawltry.
He needs good discipline.

50
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,118
You are quite right, Wey-Smith.

51
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:40,614
No woman is safe here if we
tolerate rotters like Dawltry.

52
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,985
Cheerio.
- Cheers to you.

53
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:44,951
Cheerio.

54
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:58,646
Yes, sir?

55
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,035
Ah, steward.

56
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:03,604
The young lady who sits at this table.

57
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:05,288
She ..

58
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,698
Seems to be dining rather
late this evening, huh?

59
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:09,279
I'm sorry, sir.

60
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:11,529
But Miss Crosby had dinner
served in her state room.

61
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:14,368
Oh.

62
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,447
Well, in that event I will ..

63
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,016
I will just have some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

64
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:21,818
And .. on deck.

65
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:23,818
Yes, sir.

66
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:26,154
Will you have breakfast here
sir, or at your own table?

67
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,614
I'll answer that one in the morning.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,237
You know, for a very
proper English lighter.

69
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,422
You should be ashamed of yourself.

70
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,126
A person would think that one
flame would be enough for you.

71
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,829
Without annoying every lady you see.

72
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:12,931
Even make them dine in
stuffy cabins to avoid you.

73
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,055
I'm going to make you apologise.

74
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:18,812
If I ever meet the charming lady.

75
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,757
In the meantime I think I'll drown
you in a tall brandy and soda.

76
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,506
For being so rude.

77
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,044
No.

78
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:02,021
Leave the bottle.

79
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,544
Why didn't you take me out?

80
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,716
So we'd lose the rubber my dear.

81
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:08,137
False chivalry.

82
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:10,133
It's too confounded hot for bridge.

83
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,283
Absurd, you know.
- And too hot to argue about it.

84
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:16,400
Is it your first trip out here?

85
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:18,363
No. But it is my last.

86
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:20,376
The tropics is no place for a white man.

87
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:22,599
Unless he has no place else to go.

88
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,329
Well, bridge helps.

89
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,144
Playing solitaire is a lonely game.

90
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,293
Out here.

91
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,056
Cyril, you ought to stick to rummy
or hearts or something like that.

92
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:34,658
I'm sorry, my dear.
I didn't deal the cards, you know.

93
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:37,505
Alright, I don't want to play the game.

94
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:49,146
There you are.

95
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,298
Thank you, sir. I hope you've
had a pleasant voyage.

96
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:53,484
Thank you.

97
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,144
We've docked, sir.

98
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,907
I fear Reggie, this is as
plain as a London fog.

99
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:10,024
I know my dear Simpson. I know.

100
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,872
But I can't see through it.

101
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:15,249
And if it wasn't so plain you
could. I know you could.

102
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,803
But that is just why
I can't, old fellow.

103
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:29,319
A beastly climate, sir.
Khota is the hottest port we make.

104
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:34,477
Perhaps I shan't mind it.

105
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,077
Goodbye, sir. Thank you again.

106
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:52,332
Goodbye, good luck.

107
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:03,327
You will find it gets rather damp.

108
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:04,769
Won't you join me?

109
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:28,028
If you're not careful you'll fall out of
that funny thing and break your neck.

110
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,186
And you'll be drowned. So why not take
this umbrella and save both our lives?

111
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:34,700
I can't take an umbrella from someone
whom I never expect to see again.

112
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,169
Most people do just that.
It's an international custom.

113
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:38,782
So. Our introduction.

114
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,228
I wonder how Adam met Eve.

115
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:44,477
It was probably raining.
- Not much harder than this surely?

116
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:46,840
Now see here.

117
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,961
Anyone can see you're a stranger here.

118
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:51,656
And since you have a
corner on transportation ..

119
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,093
Where may I take you?

120
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:02,510
You may drop me at
number 17 Khota Road East.

121
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:03,435
17 ..?

122
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:05,645
17 Khota Road East?

123
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:06,801
Good.

124
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:29,840
The rain has stopped.

125
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,985
Do you think we need the
umbrella any longer?

126
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,615
Oh, the sun is just as bad.

127
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:38,069
You know when this country
gets tired of parboiling you ..

128
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:39,532
It begins baking you.

129
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,479
Until you are done to a crisp.

130
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,080
What a charming future.

131
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,427
Of course, I take it for granted that
you are going to be here for some time.

132
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,795
You are taking a lot for
granted, aren't you?

133
00:10:59,029 --> 00:10:59,672
Well.

134
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,170
This is it.

135
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,053
I will .. help you in.

136
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:21,817
Rickshaw.

137
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:26,391
He ..

138
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:29,451
Said for us to go right in
and make ourselves at home.

139
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:30,902
Here we are.

140
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,329
The servant seems to
know you, Mr Dawltry.

141
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,709
Oh yes, yes. I am a
frequent visitor here.

142
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,638
Where is everybody, do you suppose?

143
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,897
Well, there only three places in
this town where they could be.

144
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:48,493
The bar of the club.

145
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,188
The card room of the club.

146
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,479
Or the swimming pool of the club.

147
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,554
You say they were expecting you?
- I cabled them of course.

148
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,155
Well, delivering the cable in
Khota is quite another matter.

149
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:04,320
Sometimes we get our
Christmas greetings by Easter.

150
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:05,762
You are an optimist.

151
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:07,097
Well, trying to be.

152
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:08,862
There goes your limousine.

153
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:14,110
Oh yes, yes. I .. I sent it away.

154
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,339
Well, how do you expect to get home?

155
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:18,972
I walk.

156
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,150
My bungalow is ..

157
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:22,803
Very close.

158
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,754
Won't you sit down?

159
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:33,327
Isn't that a lovely skin?

160
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,139
Yes, it is.

161
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,134
I'll see if I can't dig up
something to drink.

162
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,674
Doesn't George look funny.

163
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,871
Your brother was an intern
when that was taken.

164
00:12:57,725 --> 00:13:00,700
They all look funny until practising
medicine makes them look worse.

165
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,573
Is that why you are still
a bachelor, Dr Muir?

166
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:05,949
That and my pocketbook.

167
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,917
George is lucky.

168
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:12,043
I couldn't find a girl who'd wait until
I made a success and then send for her.

169
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,084
Doctor Muir.

170
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,290
Hello everybody.

171
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:20,696
I say, these native women have babies at
the most unexpected times and places.

172
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,580
Well, where is the bride?

173
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:23,925
Isn't she with you?

174
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,251
An emergency call came
to the hospital just as I left.

175
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,395
So I sent Ali to the dock

Ali, where are you?

179
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:37,404
What are you doing out here?
- Nothing, sahib.

180
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:40,075
Did you go to the boat as I told you?
- Yes, sahib. I go now.

181
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,733
You've been at the gin again?

182
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:44,055
No, sahib. Been at boat. Not see nobody.

183

Don't lie to me you
sneaking, heathen rat.

George, don't.

I will not tolerate drunken servants.

his place in this country.

is at the boat to meet her?

standing at the dock now.

Come on, some of you.

No, my dear Reggie. It was an elephant.
- I say it was a leopard.

- Leopard.

They can't deliver a passenger
like him to women.

204
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,486
An outrage. Men like Dawltry
shouldn't be at large.

He looks like such a
well-behaved little lighter.

I can hardly believe all
the gossip about him.

house a more suitable place?

aboard the boat.

That depends upon the audience.

The audience is leaving.
Without any sign of applause.

curtain on some future engagement?

But it was worth it.

355
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,321
A case like that puts fire into a man.

It seems to go out before you get home.

357
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:12,358
What you need is a change.
Something to occupy your mind.

358
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:15,729
How would you like to nurse this case?

359
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,247
Hmm? And work together as we used to.

360
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,037
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

361
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,255
I'm never going back
to it, George. Never.

362
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:32,099
Not for a moment.

363
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,320
I came out here to be a wife.

364
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:37,500

Excitement?
- Who wouldn't be excited?

369
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:22,050
Another dinner at the Gymkhana Club
with the same old Nikko to take me.

370
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:24,776
And the same fussy old
people to dance with.

371
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,579

diversion and go like this.

It's a bore and you know it.

375
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:33,547
You are too young to be bored.

376
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,816
Married people aren't the
only ones to suffer that way.

377
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,920
And you're much too young to be cynical.

I was just thinking how
frightfully funny it would be ..

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,727
If you didn't really
care for George at all.

382
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:50,678
If secretly you thought he had
turned out to be an awful sinker.

383
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,969
Sinker?
- Yes, you know. Blob.

384
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:58,215
It might be funny if we didn't have to
spend the rest of our lives together.

385
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:02,562
I imagine you're the kind who would take
a marriage contract awfully seriously.

00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,926
I suppose George is
alright as husbands go.

387
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,396
But if I were married, I'd want
my husband with me always.

388

You rarely see him unless
you go to the hospital ..

389

room full of native patients.

Nope. I'm sorry.

- But you can't come in.

for Rene's birthday dinner.

Well there can't be more than
one Dawltry in Khota, I hope.

Didn't you make these out?

You can't be serious about it?

413
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:07,217
But from the fuss you are making
it must be terribly serious.

414
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:09,833
I think it's going to be thrilling.

415
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:13,224
You don't mean to say that you sent <i>him</i>
an invitation to your birthday dinner?

Why shouldn't we?

Now please, Phil. You haven't been here
long enough to know about Dawltry.

418
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,366
But I can't understand such
an oversight on Rene's part.

419
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:23,004
Surely she has heard.

420
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,173
But Rene didn't send
out all the invitations.

421
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,487
I helped her.

422
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:29,318
You sent it?
- I'm quite sure I did.

423
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:31,443
He's our next-door neighbour.

424
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,557
But he's strictly taboo.

425
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,880
You forget Phil's still a stranger here.

426
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:37,875
She hasn't even met the gentleman.

427
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,867
And she's not going to be placed
in a position where she has to.

But he's probably the most
interesting man in town.

They say Doris Drayton
followed him all over the orient.

After she left her husband.
- You're not going to meet him either.

00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:52,308
Stop growling, you old bear.

432
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:54,083
Who wants to meet him anyway?

433
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,310
What is that awful smell?

434
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:00,173
Huh? Oh, antiseptic.

435
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:02,022

Memsahib is here, Memsahib.

438
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:08,958
Here is Nikki. I must run.

439
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:13,550

makes love to every woman in the place.

00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:19,590
Now look here, Phil.
Something has to be done.

443
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:22,653
Why worry about something
that can't be undone?

444
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:23,733
It's Rene.

445
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,530
She's just at the impressionable age.

446
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:29,658
And I suppose this notorious Dawltry
person is just at the dangerous age?

447
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,778
You don't understand Phil,
or you wouldn't try to shield her.

448
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:34,070
Shield Rene?

449
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:37,104
You don't suppose I believe for a
moment that you sent that invitation?

450
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,595
Of course I did.

451
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,843
But if the poor man knows how
hospitable you feel about him ..

452
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:45,866
He probably won't accept anyway.

453
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:47,263
No.

454
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,650
Perhaps you are right.

455
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,473
Perhaps you had better dress
for dinner before it's too late.

456
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:56,688
Suppose he does come?

457
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,897
But I thought we just
decided he wouldn't.

458
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:02,405
Yes. Alright.

459
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,709
Now, let me see.

00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:11,651
Telephone, Dr March.

461
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,406
The hospital, I suppose.

462
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:17,118
It was the Duke's brother.

463
00:29:17,318 --> 00:29:19,304
But you are wrong, old Eddie.
It was his cousin.

464
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:21,854
But, my dear fellow.
I assure you it was the Duke's brother.

465
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,759
You can take it here, Dr March.
It's the hospital.

466
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,244
Get me a whisky and soda.

467
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,573
Very mild.

468
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:31,295
Yes?

469
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:32,793
Dr March speaking.

470
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,051
Yes. Yes. I'm listening.

471
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:56,176
I'm sure I detect whisky in that.

472
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,538
Oh, Miss Wey-Smith.

473
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:02,111
Just a little bit to the right.

474
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,356

475
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:08,840

00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:20,506
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

502
00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:25,239
The first dance and it's a tango.

Don't you love it, Mr Dawltry?

Come on Rene old dear. My dance.

505
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,852
Shall we dance this?

506
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:43,788
Well.

507
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,484
Really, I ..

508
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,142
You must smash that plate.

509
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:48,583
I am afraid.

510
00:31:48,982 --> 00:31:49,818
Of what?

511
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:11,791
But nobody moved, sir.

512
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:18,983
It's too bad you missed the picture.

513
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,091
Yes. The hospital, you know.
- Yes, you doctors.

514
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:24,705
You're such busy creatures.

515
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:28,134
Shall we dance?

516
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,282
I'd be delighted, Mrs Wey-Smith.
But I don't tango.

517
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,138
I will teach you, George.

518
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:34,735
It's quite simple.

519
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,508
Come, I'll show you the new step.
This is the new one.

520
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,366
And this is what gets exciting.

521
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:58,226
You rather dance it as a
straight tango. Then we go ..

522
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,686
You are bored, aren't you.

523
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,480
On the contrary.

524
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:12,718
Have a cigarette?

525
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:14,387
Your brand on that side.

526
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,114
No thanks.

527
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:18,511
There won't be time.

528
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:20,755
You.

529
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,195
Enjoy Khota society then?

530
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:25,185
I thought you might for a change.

531
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,521
Am I living down to my repudiation?

532
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:32,421
I never believe all I hear.

533
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:35,312
So you invited me here to find out, huh?

534
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:38,698
I doubt if you're half as
bad as they see you are.

535
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,959
Oh yes?

536
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,555
In my bungalow you had
me at a disadvantage.

537
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:46,951
You were unprotected then.

538
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:48,497
And now that I am married?

539
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:56,917
Please.

540
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:01,100
I thought I wouldn't
entirely disappoint you.

541
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,983
Since I am here on parade.

542
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,499
You.

543
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:07,552
You think that?

544
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:10,858
Is there any other reason that would
make you invite me here as your guest?

545
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:15,161
No.

546
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:17,230
No.

547
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,444
No. You were right in the first place.

548
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,037
Phil .. where are you?

549
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,715
Here I am, George.

550
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:29,648
Are you in the habit of dancing
with ladies that you've never met?

551
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:32,682
Only when the lady is my hostess.

552
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:34,784
Oh, Sorry, Dawltry.

553
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:37,052
This is my wife. Mrs March.

554
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:38,950
It's a pleasure.

555
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:41,135
Now that we really know each other ..

556
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:43,763
Come along, Phil.
- Goodnight, Mr Dawltry.

557
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,622
I hope you won't think me rude.

558
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:48,680
Tearing myself away like this without
even one dance with your sister.

559
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,383
I hope you'll excuse me, George.

560
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:53,525
I would never excuse you if
you <i>did</i> dance with my sister.

561
00:34:56,835 --> 00:34:59,351
Well, in that event I can go home
with a perfectly clear conscience.

562
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:03,282
Oh, Mr Dawltry.

563
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:06,999
So that is where you've been hiding.

564
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:09,761
We all wondered what had become of you.

565
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:11,873
I would hardly call it
hiding, Mrs Wey-Smith.

566
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:12,852
I should.

567
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,195
With such divine music.

568
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,803
Do you tango, Mr Dawltry?

569
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:20,620
No.
- I know you do.

570
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:24,082
After having just seen
you with our hostess.

571
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,552
Come with me and I will show you ..

572
00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:46,523
I could dance like this forever.

573
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:47,837
With you.

574
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:50,053
My husband is so jealous.

575
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:52,128
Oh yes, I can understand that.

576
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,631
George, I have ..
- What is it?

577
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,444
I have my new shoes on.

578
00:35:57,762 --> 00:35:58,405
What?

579
00:35:58,626 --> 00:35:59,841
Did I step all over them?

580
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,646
Well, there may be one
tiny spot you've missed.

581
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:04,099
Well, let's chuck it.

582
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,646
No, George.

583
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:10,092
No. I insist on finishing it.

584
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:14,482
Doctor March says I'm like a feather.

585
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:16,604
I am so light on my feet.

586
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:18,415
Who's feet?

587
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:26,067
[ Loud drumming ]

588
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,451
Will that be all, Sahib?

589
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,129
Yes. Goodnight, Khan.

590
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:35,446
Did you open another bottle
of brandy and leave some ice?

591
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,495
Yes, I have. And your bed
also is very cool now.

592
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,861
No use trying to sleep
with those drums going.

593
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:48,886
What is that?

594
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:51,114
A funeral or a wedding?
- No, Sahib.

595
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:53,814
It's a love feast to the Goddess Kronos.

596
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:56,833
All our young men
take brides at this time.

597
00:36:57,368 --> 00:37:00,266
It lasts one, two ..

598
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:01,950
Three, four days.

599
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,002
Long enough for most marriages.

600
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:06,702
Yes, Sahib.

601
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:01,368
I've got to get up.

602
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,023
I've got a lot to do today.

603
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,265
Phil?

604
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:13,412
You're up so early.

605
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:22,339
Phil.

606
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:37,609
Rene.

607
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,544
What on earth do you want?

608
00:39:41,871 --> 00:39:43,830
Have you seen Phil?
- She went out riding.

609
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,812
She said she couldn't sleep all night.
Needed some fresh air.

610
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,839
Why didn't she tell me?
- She told me to tell you.

611
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:52,905
I can't understand Phil
these last few weeks.

612
00:39:55,113 --> 00:39:56,930
She acts as though
she's contracting a fever.

613
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,755
Mrs Wey-Smith says it's ..

614
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:00,248
The heat.

615
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:11,480
Well, that's cooled me off a bit.
- Cooled you off?

616
00:40:11,957 --> 00:40:12,916
I said a bit.

617
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:16,663
The only thing that will cool
me off is a drink at the bar.

618
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:19,206
I'll have a Stinger with you too.
- Alright.

619
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:27,833
Wey-Smith.

620
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,411
Everard.

621
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:34,195
Duckworth.

622
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:36,768
Some new game?

623
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:37,782
No.

624
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,422
Just killing off a few pests.

625
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,873
Here.

626
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:48,936
March.

627
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,653
What?

628
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:53,584
I beg your pardon.

629
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:55,424
Granted.

630
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:57,363
Have a drink.

631
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:59,664
I've better things to do than
to hang around drinking.

632
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,479
Until then, doctor .. your health.

633
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:03,979
I preserve mine with plenty of brandy.

634
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:06,345
Brandy and ..

635
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:07,955
Early morning rides.

636
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:10,553
Nothing like horseback
riding to pep you up, George.

637
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,504
It gives you a new lease on life.

638
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,934
You should follow my example.

639
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:21,236
Is that you, Phil?

640
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:23,836
Hello George.

641
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:24,680
Rene.

642
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,488
Where have you been?

643
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:29,024
Just riding.

644
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,509
What are you doing here?

645
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,147
Waiting for Phil. We are going
to have luncheon together.

646
00:41:37,437 --> 00:41:40,025
The club is no place
for a young girl alone.

647
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,258
How cross you are. Where do
you want me to wait, in the pool?

648
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,867
Not in here at any rate.

649
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,038
Under the circumstances.

650
00:41:54,098 --> 00:41:55,371
Thought I forgot something.

651
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,499
The telephone, Miss March.

652
00:41:59,795 --> 00:42:01,583
Hurry it up, will you?
I'll wait at the car.

653
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:04,035
But I have my horse.
- Alright. Hurry up and get right home.

654
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:05,384
Alright, Hello?

655
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:07,059
Hello, Nikko.

656
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:09,364
No, I haven't forgotten. Goodbye.

657
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,006
Where did you ride this morning?

658
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:26,406
I didn't see you.

659
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,033
Lonely men take lonely paths.

660
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,601
Do you always ride alone?

661
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:36,234
Sometimes the horse goes with me.

662
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,412
Silly.

663
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,244
I love riding.

664
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:41,483
But ..

665
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:45,001
Why does everyone start
out at the crack of dawn?

666
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,867
You know what they say
about the early-bird.

667
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:50,363
I suppose the lazy ones
only catch the heat.

668
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:53,134
And a scolding from their big
brothers for going out in it.

669
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:55,492
George isn't my keeper.

670
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,332
I belong to no-one but myself.

671
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:00,940
The safest possible companionship
for very young ladies.

672
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:03,748
But it isn't much fun.

673
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:05,581
Belonging to oneself.

674
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,738
Don't you try to vamp me young woman.

675
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:11,073
I could, easily.

676
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,173
Well.

677
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:17,013
If this keeps on I shall either have to
turn you over my knee or run for home.

678
00:43:17,453 --> 00:43:19,033
In the first place, I'd scream.

679
00:43:19,272 --> 00:43:21,117
In the second, I'd run after you.

680
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:24,016
I've been dying to see
your bungalow anyway.

681
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:25,840
You wouldn't like it.

682
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:27,669
Orgies. Terrible goings on.

683
00:43:28,098 --> 00:43:29,525
I wouldn't be a bit frightened.

684
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,799
Even of being alone with you.

685
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:34,503
In my bungalow?
- Uhuh.

686
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:36,012
Wouldn't it be thrilling?

687
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:39,677
I think there is something wonderful
about a secret shared by two people.

688
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:42,515
It certainly gives the rest of the
community something to talk about.

689
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:45,128
Must you treat me like a child?

690
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:46,367
I hope not.

691
00:43:47,218 --> 00:43:48,948
Because I don't want
to have to spank you.

692
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:51,467
Whoo, what a fierce ogre.

693
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,254
Well, I really am.

694
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,296
But I don't spend my leisure
eating up baby sisters.

695
00:43:57,037 --> 00:43:57,966
You little mug.

696
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:01,512
Oh you, you're the most annoying person.

697
00:44:02,045 --> 00:44:03,575
Suppose your brother walked in here?

698
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,722
And heard you call the notorious
Hugh Dawltry by his first name?

699
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:08,958
But he won't. He's going away.

700
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:12,390
George is?
- Yes.

701
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,856
He sails this evening to take a special
patient to the hospital in Colombo.

702
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,080
Well.

703
00:44:19,974 --> 00:44:22,747
I'll have to send him some
flowers to wish him Bon Voyage.

704
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,006
A nice basket of fruit.

705
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:26,844
What kind does George like best?

706
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:28,703
I wish you would forget George.

707
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:31,376
I intend to.
- So do I.

708
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,684
And also stay out as late
as I wish while he's gone.

709
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,346
You'll find that a rather boring
privilege with no place to go.

710
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:44,854
Oh yeah?

711
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,469
No, you are wrong.
- I'm right.

712
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:51,961
It was in the spring of 1864.

713
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:54,117
65.

714
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,506
64.

715
00:44:56,347 --> 00:44:57,447
65.

716
00:45:14,082 --> 00:45:16,323
Nice to hear that piano again.
- Hello George.

717
00:45:16,523 --> 00:45:17,624
You look much better.

718
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,800
I was afraid you were
coming down with a fever.

719
00:45:20,037 --> 00:45:21,933
But not with those sparkling eyes.

720
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,646
You look quite your old self today.
- Do I, George?

721
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:27,622
It's nice to hear you say that.

722
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:30,294
You know, I'm worried about Rene.

723
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:32,996
You always have to
worry about something.

724
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:34,402
You lunch with her?

725
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:37,496
Why, no. I haven't seen Rene
since early this morning.

726
00:45:37,856 --> 00:45:38,929
Then she lied to me.

727
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:40,702
About what?
- About everything.

728
00:45:40,902 --> 00:45:42,621
Do you know what she did this morning?

729
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,581
She's been riding with Dawltry.

730
00:45:44,802 --> 00:45:46,844
But that is impossible. I ..
- Why is it impossible?

731
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:47,973
Well ..

732
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,220
Well, I mean it is absurd.

733
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:51,750
Rene is just a child.

734
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,829
She's eighteen.
That's a woman in the tropics.

735
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:54,834
George.

736
00:45:55,034 --> 00:45:58,652
The heat is bad enough on married women.
But on young girls it is dynamite.

737
00:45:59,438 --> 00:46:01,435
It makes them man-crazy.
- Really, George.

738
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:04,481
I know what I'm talking about.
It's a pathological fact.

739
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:07,905
Has it another long name or do
you just call it a heatwave?

740
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,957
Now please, Phil.
This is no laughing matter.

741
00:46:10,326 --> 00:46:13,190
And it means danger with
men like Dawltry around.

742
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,098
Really George, you are precious.

743
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:16,610
I'm not wrong though.

744
00:46:17,415 --> 00:46:21,083
You tell Rene to pack her bags because
I'm taking her to Colombo with me.

745
00:46:23,457 --> 00:46:25,665
And by the way. I forgot to tell you.

746
00:46:25,935 --> 00:46:27,887
Our weekend trip to
the mountains is off.

747
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:30,101
Business before pleasure, my dear.

748
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:34,171
Then you are going to Colombo instead?

749
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:37,486
I see.

750
00:46:39,204 --> 00:46:40,648
And you are taking Rene with you?

751
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:43,252
Yes. So I can keep my eye on her.

752
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:47,909
[ Door knocks ]

753
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,122
For me?
- Yes, Memsahib.

754
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:09,570
Was that Rene?

755
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,586
No. Just the mail.

756
00:47:12,536 --> 00:47:13,522
For me, isn't it?

757
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:15,378
No, George.

758
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,107
George.

759
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:45,627
What is it?

760
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:47,637
I wish you'd come and help me pack.

761
00:47:47,837 --> 00:47:50,077
I can't find a thing.
- Alright, George. But ..

762
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:55,083
Do you think taking Rene
with you is exactly wise?

763
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,202
You know, I'll be here alone.

764
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:59,291
Better alone than with
her on your hands.

765
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,332
She is too much of a responsibility.

766
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:03,585
I'm not going to ask
you to play detective.

767
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:11,307
Where are my socks and my
clean shirts? I can't find a one.

768
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:14,997
Are you coming, Phil?
- Yes, George. I'm coming.

769
00:48:49,298 --> 00:48:49,968
Well.

770
00:48:50,788 --> 00:48:53,104
See? I did find a place to go after all.

771
00:48:53,325 --> 00:48:54,655
Rather childish I should say.

772
00:48:57,451 --> 00:49:00,005
I'm old enough to know that
when a man like you ..

773
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:02,832
Says 'no' to a woman,
he really means 'yes'.

774
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:06,015
And besides, I like your style.

775
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:08,541
So I see.

776
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:12,695
And I like your bungalow.

777
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:15,991
But I couldn't find an orgy any place.

778
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:17,557
Now that's nice.

779
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,514
Now that you have seen everything.

780
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:21,099
Oh, but I haven't.

781
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:23,005
Not <i>everything</i>.

782
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:25,921
What's in here?

783
00:49:26,776 --> 00:49:28,193
That is where I sleep.
- Ooh.

784
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:29,742
How thrilling.

785
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:31,864
I've never found sleep so thrilling.

786
00:49:33,197 --> 00:49:34,578
Except in Khota.

787
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:38,484
I don't believe you're half as
bored as you always pretend.

788
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:39,505
No?

789
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:41,794
Just careful.

790
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:44,629
I am.

791
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:46,364
Very careful.

792
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:49,135
No, shall I call you a rickshaw
or will you walk home?

793
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:51,294
But I'm not ready to go home yet.

794
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:54,956
Now I know how you
fascinate all the women.

795
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:59,997
You make them think you don't want
them When you really do all the time.

796
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:01,271
Or ..

797
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,071
Are you afraid of me?

798
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:09,583
Oh, Mr Dawltry.

799
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,339
Oh, where are we going?

800
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:12,827
What are you going to do?

801
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:15,617
You mustn't take me there.

802
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,221
Where else, my sweet?

803
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,531
Let me go. I'll scream. Let me go!

804
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:21,146
Let me go, let me go.

805
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,503
I'll scream, let me go. Let me go.

806
00:50:29,063 --> 00:50:31,022
Well, for a woman with
experience in such matters.

807
00:50:31,568 --> 00:50:32,583
I am disappointed.

808
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:35,250
I think I am too.

809
00:50:35,936 --> 00:50:36,707
Well.

810
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:39,083
Good afternoon, Mr Dawltry.

811
00:50:39,684 --> 00:50:40,758
I had a nice time.

812
00:50:49,503 --> 00:50:51,099
So, my suspicions were right.

813
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:52,712
This is where you've been.

814
00:50:53,457 --> 00:50:56,533
But I haven't. Really.
I just dropped by from the club.

815
00:50:56,896 --> 00:50:59,517
You've not been at the club for hours.
I looked for you every place.

816
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:00,753
Hmm.

817
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:03,065
Well.

818
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:05,926
I hope we haven't made
an old maid of her.

819
00:51:10,386 --> 00:51:11,058
But ..

820
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,018
What were you doing
in Dawltry's bungalow?

821
00:51:13,606 --> 00:51:14,335
Nothing.

822
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:15,909
That is, I ..

823
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:17,741
I came to borrow a phonograph record.

824
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:23,756
You go home and pack because you
are coming with me to Colombo.

825
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,035
Now, hurry.

826
00:51:25,494 --> 00:51:26,337
Yes, George.

827
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:35,361
Well.

828
00:51:42,563 --> 00:51:43,605
Been waiting long?

829
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:44,986
Dawltry.

830
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:48,262
My sister was just here.
- You don't tell me.

831
00:51:48,536 --> 00:51:50,096
Well, now I am sorry I wasn't home.

832
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:51,695
Lucky for you, you weren't.

833
00:51:52,504 --> 00:51:53,648
Unlucky, I should say.

834
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,683
This has gone far enough, Dawltry.

835
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:58,715
I'll tell Rene the next time I see her.
- There will be no next time.

836
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,825
And if I ever see you
even talking to her ..

837
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:03,612
You are going to have another patient.

838
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:05,481
If you don't stop your talk about me.

839
00:52:06,851 --> 00:52:10,451
That is if you are contortionist enough
to patch your own rather boring face.

840
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:12,604
Now get out.

841
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,562
And stay out of my affairs
until they concern you.

842
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:17,296
If they ever do, Dawltry.

843
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,120
I'm coming back here with a gun.

844
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:32,035
Rene, can't you hurry?

845
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:35,211
We have plenty of time.
- But my patient is aboard.

846
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:01,600
She is there, doctor March.

847
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:03,568
I'll ask the Captain to hold the boat.

848
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:07,616
What on earth is the matter now?

849
00:53:08,002 --> 00:53:09,233
The patient died.

850
00:53:10,602 --> 00:53:11,731
And we're not sailing?

851
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:14,092
There is no use now.

852
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,240
But you couldn't help it, dear.

853
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:20,268
Every doctor must lose some patients.
- You don't understand, Rene.

854
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:23,092
This one had sacrococcygeal tumour.

855
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:25,961
I would have been photographed with it.

856
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:29,491
All the medical journals would
have mentioned my name.

857
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:31,055
Come, George.

858
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:35,010
Perhaps you'll find another disease with
a much longer name, right here at home.

859
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:50,077
Angry?

860
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:52,079
I should be, shouldn't I?

861
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,639
Ah, but she's such
a kissable little girl.

862
00:53:55,661 --> 00:53:57,388
You know I think you are rather nice.

863
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:00,313
Almost too nice for all the
things they say about you.

864
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,515
Do you know what I think?

865
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:05,396
No. Tell me.

866
00:54:08,858 --> 00:54:09,587
Shall I?

867
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:17,790
Well.

868
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:19,179
Perhaps not.

869
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:20,659
Now.

870
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:28,064
Those drums.

871
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:30,925
They've been going incessantly
for the past two nights.

872
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:37,714
It is a native feast to Kronos.

873
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:40,386
She is their goddess of love.

874
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,598
Some hideous idol, I suppose.

875
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:45,031
No. This goddess was rather human.

876
00:54:45,945 --> 00:54:48,914
A virtuous lady who sneaked
off to earth for one night.

877
00:54:49,883 --> 00:54:51,103
To taste sin.

878
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:54,745
Was she forgiven?

879
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,237
She found love.

880
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,136
For only one night?

881
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:05,259
That's where she ceased to be human.

882
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:10,380
And what happened to this
very modern goddess of love?

883
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:12,926
After her one night.

884
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:16,765
She went back to her spirit world.

885
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:19,247
A childish sort of legend, isn't it.

886
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:21,144
Yes.

887
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:24,614
No woman could go back after that.

890
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:36,754
Oh please, Hugh.
- Philippa.

891
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,800
Do you love me?
- Yes, I am afraid I do.

892
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,012
And I love you.

893
00:55:40,744 --> 00:55:41,873
Do you?
- Believe me.

894
00:55:42,575 --> 00:55:44,067
Oh, I want to believe you.

895
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,767
Even though I shouldn't.

My dear.

898
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:57,420
Sometimes, even reputations
have false faces.

899
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:05,872
Wasn't Doris Drayton a
misunderstood wife also?

900
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:08,283
Not only misunderstood.

901
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:10,050
But misguided.

902
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:12,626
By her trust in a certain man?

903
00:56:13,497 --> 00:56:15,818
By her appraisal of that
man's feelings for her.

904
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:21,354
Surely you weren't one of those
innocent correspondents?

905
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:24,274
Not from any virtuous
inclination on my part.

906
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:28,546
I simply never wanted Doris Drayton.
Not even for a moment.

907
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,715
But she spent the night
in your bungalow.

908
00:56:31,338 --> 00:56:32,893
The third night of her honeymoon.

909
00:56:33,648 --> 00:56:35,335
On the strength of her own convictions.

910
00:56:35,732 --> 00:56:37,443
And I suppose your strength of will ..

911
00:56:37,758 --> 00:56:40,766
Was not enough to convince the
newspapers and the court differently.

912
00:56:40,966 --> 00:56:42,322
In the face of appearances.

913
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:44,248
Besides.

914
00:56:44,823 --> 00:56:46,530
Doris didn't want vindication.

915
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,324
She wanted a divorce.

916
00:56:49,424 --> 00:56:50,849
I was only her tool to get it.

917
00:56:55,398 --> 00:56:56,928
And after that night, what happened?

918
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,255
Well her father and I
went on a glorious jag.

919
00:57:01,224 --> 00:57:03,159
Her father?
- Finished up in China.

920
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:05,294
There weren't two drunker
men in the orient.

921
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:06,881
A bit maudlin, wasn't it.

922
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:10,160
You call that .. maudlin?

923
00:57:10,821 --> 00:57:11,729
Don't you?

924
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:15,951
I think it's the nicest ending
to a story I ever heard.

925
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:25,290
There could be a much
nicer ending to ours.

926
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,830
A boat sails tomorrow at dawn.

927
00:57:31,637 --> 00:57:33,126
For Singapore and the Far East.

928
00:57:33,702 --> 00:57:36,022
I'm going to let you write
the last chapter of ours.

929
00:57:36,782 --> 00:57:38,032
If it ends without one.

930
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:40,215
I will understand.

931
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,609
I wonder where Phil is.

932
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:05,220
In bed probably at this hour.
And that's where you go, young lady.

933
00:58:06,022 --> 00:58:08,219
Goodnight, you crosspatch.
- Goodnight.

934
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:11,261
And don't wake Phil.

935
00:58:49,227 --> 00:58:50,312
Well, where is Phil?

936
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:53,063
Probably at the club.

937
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:55,181
Where else could she be in this town?

938
00:59:12,323 --> 00:59:13,910
Do you suppose I should call the club?

939
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,192
What's that you have there?

940
00:59:18,074 --> 00:59:18,914
Nothing.

941
00:59:19,253 --> 00:59:21,584
Will you please go to bed and
stop worrying about Phil and me.

942
00:59:21,784 --> 00:59:22,742
That's a letter.

943
00:59:23,033 --> 00:59:23,762

00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:25,771
That piece of paper you hide.
- George ..

945
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:27,472
And it's from that rotter, Dawltry.

946
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:29,177
I see it all now.

947
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:32,070
You had a date with him. That's why
you didn't want to go to Colombo.

948
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,737
Don't be silly.
- Let me see it.

Let me see it.
- George, stop.

Don't take it from me.
- Give it to me. Let me have it.

951
00:59:49,505 --> 00:59:51,754
It's all a mistake.
I'm sure it is, George.

952
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,478
Please. Please don't go.

953
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:54,725
It's not true.

954
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,893
Now this doesn't concern you at all.
This is entirely my business.

955

Please, George.

Do you notice how differently
those drums sound?

960
01:00:33,473 --> 01:00:35,430
There's a certain music
in them, isn't there.

961
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:39,389

- Yes, dear?

Please, not now.

964
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,738
Much wiser now than later.

Are you afraid I'll be sorry?

Yes, I am.

967

Like all the others.
- Don't, dear.

968
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:57,959
I want to forget all that.

969
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,646
But you don't want to be forgotten.

970
01:01:02,103 --> 01:01:02,975
As they were.

971
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,962
But you couldn't if you loved me.

972

I do now.

973
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:10,061
But there's always a chance that
it won't last with a man like me.

974
01:01:11,307 --> 01:01:13,586
I've never known anything
deeper than a conquest.

975
01:01:14,582 --> 01:01:16,592
This has suddenly turned
out to be something else.

976

But if we love each other,
what else is there?

977

979
01:01:24,425 --> 01:01:25,898
I lied to you about Doris Drayton.

980
01:01:27,014 --> 01:01:28,556
I really did break up a home.

981
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:30,319
I thought I wanted her.

982
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:31,591
Then found I didn't.

I'm not going to leave another
Doris Drayton behind me.

984
01:01:35,302 --> 01:01:36,982
Now you are just being heroic.

985
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:39,066
And I don't want you to be.

986
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,198
She furnished the

987

Took her lover so seriously.

988
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,862
His departure left the door
open to many lovers.

989
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:47,788
As her only consolation.

990
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,508
She wasn't the kind who
could go back either.

991
01:01:50,737 --> 01:01:51,858
I'm not afraid.

992
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:55,049
If a woman can't hold a
man it's her own fault.

993
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:56,807
But the risk is there.

994

I won't let you take it.

995
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,765
It's not much of a risk for happiness.

1061
01:05:00,223 --> 01:05:02,475
And that cad took advantage of it.

1062
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:04,209
Not of me, George. You did that.

1063
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:07,442
All you wanted was a wife.
Any woman would have done as well.

1064
01:05:07,705 --> 01:05:10,386
And some other woman can
take my place from now on.

1065
01:05:12,759 --> 01:05:15,000
I was going away with Hugh Dawltry.

1066
01:05:16,138 --> 01:05:19,047
But he refused to put me in
the position of Doris Drayton.

1067
01:05:20,186 --> 01:05:22,059
He said he loved me too much.

1068
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,183
You swine.

1069
01:05:25,615 --> 01:05:28,888
Perhaps my heroics
were a mistake after all.

1070
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:35,536
Men have such different and
peculiar definitions of love.

1071
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:38,999
To a woman, there can
be only one meaning.

1072
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:41,274
To be loved.

1073
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:44,196
Goodbye, George.

1074
01:05:46,507 --> 01:05:47,951
But you can't leave me like this.

1075
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:49,800
You will get over it.

1076
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:54,520
You may even find another
sacrococcygeal tumour to comfort you.

1077
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:56,338
Who knows?

1078
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:57,738
What will people say?

1079
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,470
My name? My reputation.

1080
01:06:00,074 --> 01:06:02,743
I am taking the boat that
leaves at dawn for Singapore.

1081
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,870
And nothing you can
say or do will stop me.

1082
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,047
Philippa.

1083
01:06:42,363 --> 01:06:43,157
Dawltry.

1084
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:45,577
A moment ago I said
you were leaving Khota.

1085
01:06:46,094 --> 01:06:48,111
You decided to get rid
of me at last. It that it?

1086
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:50,706
For good, Dawltry. And I meant it.

1087
01:06:51,103 --> 01:06:52,118
I am glad you did.

1088
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:54,716
Because that fits in
with my plans exactly.

1089
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:58,117
But you may be going to quite a
different place than you anticipated.

1090
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,122
Yes?

1091
01:06:59,554 --> 01:07:00,185
Yes.

1092
01:07:00,665 --> 01:07:02,652
I'm going to kill you, Dawltry.

1093
01:07:03,563 --> 01:07:05,808
When they know the truth
they'll all cheer me for it.

1094
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,274
Before you do ..

1095
01:07:08,662 --> 01:07:09,849
Do you mind if I finish?

1096
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,485
I have a horror of an
undertaker dressing me.

1097
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:16,241
I've never known one yet
who can tie a bow correctly.

1098
01:07:16,441 --> 01:07:18,904
I'm not Sam Drayton. You can't
make me the laughing stock of Khota.

1099
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:20,628
And then brazen your way out of it.

1100
01:07:21,401 --> 01:07:23,249
The laugh is really on me, George.

1101
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:27,754
For the first time in my life.
I've made a fool of myself over a woman.

1102
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:30,892
Because I thought she was
making a fool of herself over me.

1103
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,791
But even an attempt
at fidelity on my part.

1104
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:36,697
Would be better than letting a
wonderful woman like Philippa.

1105
01:07:37,192 --> 01:07:39,408
Shrivel up and rot in this
hole like the rest of you.

1106
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:43,286
So, I've decided to take
your wife away from you.

1107
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:47,768
If you are going to shoot me, George.

1108
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:49,737
Now is your last chance.

1109
01:07:52,011 --> 01:07:53,813
Because I am leaving
to take that same boat.

1110
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:55,367
For Singapore.

1111
01:08:11,995 --> 01:08:13,096
I'm sorry old fellow.

1112
01:08:13,376 --> 01:08:15,307
But you will have to find
a new partner in crime.

1113
01:08:15,794 --> 01:08:16,637
From now on.

1114
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,201
I'm a one-play man.

1115
01:08:21,535 --> 01:08:22,294
Cheerio.

1116
01:08:24,764 --> 01:08:26,004
[ Loud drumming ]

1117
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:43,238
..r-o..
