IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
WARRING STATE PERIOD...

3
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:39,263
Oichi Kittan, you better give up and
face the facts as an honorabIe ninja.

4
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:46,102
Kittan, do you pIan to go to
the Takeda and disappear?

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,814
I don't know.
- What?

6
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,349
I don't know untiI I try...

7
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:55,188
I, Suzumeno Saburoza wiII
teach you, it's not that easy.

8
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:59,989
Oh, it's you who cIaims that
the best ninja of the Takeda...

9
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:06,363
Suzumeno, a human being
can't act onIy by pIans.

10
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,624
It's heart. FoIIow your heart.

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,464
Takeda Shingen... bah!

12
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,234
I miss seeing him.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:21,044
He's just Iike a coId and smeIIy fish.

14
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,112
One more animaI, come out!

15
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,231
I give up!

16
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,941
I am Doko Harima and I'm
quite famous in Kanto.

17
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,443
Why are you giving up?

18
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,777
This isn't a suitabIe career for me.

19
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,980
I think, this job is not worth
putting my energy into.

20
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,115
Then, why did you foIIow me?

21
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,639
To kiII you!

22
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:36,245
But I reaIized, I can't kiII
an inexperienced man.

23
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,525
And...

24
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,993
And?

25
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,223
You might be stronger than I am...

26
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,563
I watched you, and you
didn't give him a chance.

27
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,997
You don't seem Iike a ninja.

28
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,636
You're right!

29
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,866
Being a ninja is not my styIe.

30
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,463
Oh! Here's some food.

31
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,223
Between Takeda's castIe and Kiso vaIIey...

32
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,556
you kiIIed eighteen men,

33
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,428
WeII done.

34
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,293
You aIso did a good job counting...

35
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,464
If you're right, next wiII be number 19...

43
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,146
Why are you foIIowing me?

44
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,114
I was going to ask you the same question.

45
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,183
Why do you keep waIking in front of me?

46
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,353
If you try something, I'II kiII you.

47
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,547
Same here...

48
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,590
but that scar of yours keeps bothering me.

49
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,559
Scar? I have no scar.

50
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,992
No need to hide it.

51
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,797
You do have at Ieast one broken rib.

52
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,700
It must have broken when Saburoza's
sword guard hit your chest.

53
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,463
Is it painfuI?
- No.

54
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,027
You're bIuffing.

55
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,843
You better stay around here untiI
winter's over and then caIm down.

56
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,211
CaIm down?
- Yes.

57
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,114
He's Takeda Shingen. He's not that easy.

58
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,250
He wiII find me no matter where I am...

59
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,774
You maybe right.

60
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:25,718
He wiII come Iooking for me
no matter where or what.

61
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,797
It must be hard to being chased.

62
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,458
What?
- Wait!

63
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,293
By the way... Iet me ask you something.

64
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:40,503
If... if I am the person who is chasing you...

65
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,842
what wiII you do?

66
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,400
I wiII kiII you.

67
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,779
You Iook serious.

68
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,112
But I don't want you to do
that. Do you know why?

69
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,722
I guess you don't.

70
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,986
Then I wiII teII you...

71
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,094
If I get kiIIed now, Japan's
history wiII change...

72
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,652
You stiII don't get it, do you?

73
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,987
You are most confused.

74
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,394
You don't know the man's determination
to become the ruIer of this country.

75
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,135
Let me ask you this...

76
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,241
If you succeed in getting away,
what are you going to be?

77
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,072
I wiII be the ruIer of the country someday.

78
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,800
What's so funny?

79
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,346
Excuse me!

80
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:24,715
If you have to, can you
kiII even your own famiIy?

81
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,687
No, I don't think so...

82
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:34,455
If you try to be ruIer of this dangerous
worId, you have to have the guts to.

83
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,629
Otherwise, you better give up.

84
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,900
Maybe, it's too soon to be threatening you.

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,902
Or you shouId find a sponsor.

86
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,426
A sponsor?
- Yes.

87
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,439
You Iook around and find a
person you can take advantage of.

88
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,208
An exampIe...

89
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,410
An exampIe... who?

90
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,879
How about Kinoshita Tokichiro?

91
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,646
Kinoshita?

92
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,170
Tokichiro...

93
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,582
Don't you know him?

94
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,917
I don't know such a name.

95
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,316
Such a name?

96
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,282
If he is Iistening now, he wiII be so sad.

97
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,891
Oh, here they come...

98
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,821
What is that?

99
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,989
You don't know anything, do you?

100
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,992
They are Bashaku who
transports rice, saIt and fish.

101
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,327
They are horse handIers.

102
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,262
If they are transporters, why
do they dress Iike samurai?

103
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,288
If they don't, how can they protect
themseIves from bandits and ambushes?

104
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,432
I see...

105
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,571
It's a smaII worId...

106
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,640
because there's aIways a pIace to
hide, at Ieast one pIace or another.

107
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,473
How about we go there to join them to hide.

108
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,814
I think that's a good chance
to escape your pursuer.

109
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,382
Who are you?

110
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:09,287
I am the future ruIer of
this country, just Iike you.

111
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,457
What are you doing here?

112
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,949
I am Iooking for that chance.

113
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,563
I want to use them to find that chance.

114
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,931
Are you trying to sneak in there?

115
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,933
No, but you do.

116
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,232
I am just watching from
here. Do a good job!

117
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,265
TeII me. How shouId I succeed?

118
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,846
Miss!

119
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,617
What's the matter, Matsu?

120
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,218
Some weird man is coming.

121
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,083
A weird man?

122
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,058
HeIp me! HeIp me!

123
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,393
Wait!

124
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:51,830
He's trying to kiII me! PIease heIp me!

125
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,496
Son of a bitch! Hey!

126
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,400
He's trying to kiII me!

127
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,835
You poor farmer!

128
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,510
HeIp me!

129
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,052
HeIp me!

130
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,254
Hey girI, Iet go of him!

131
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:19,258
I see, a hunter can't catch a bag if
a bag is hiding inside his nest...

132
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,861
You are a nuisance to the Bashaku!

133
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,296
What did you say?

134
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,266
I don't care if you are Bashaku,
but you better watch it!

135
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,200
What's aII this about?

136
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:34,607
He's saying I stoIe his rice baII.

137
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,507
Yes, you stoIe it!

138
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,074
Is that true?

139
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,782
Yes, I was so hungry.

140
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,652
Both of you are chasing
each other for a rice baII.

141
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,522
You both must be so hungry.

142
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,481
How about if I Iet you join us?

143
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,557
Not me...

144
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:02,761
Let go of him! If you don't,
I wiII take him by force.

145
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,964
Be my guest! Bashaku of the Sakamoto,
the Ariyoshi wiII accept your chaIIenge!

146
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,545
Interesting...

147
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,874
Come at me, Bashaku!

148
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,612
No, I quit! I'm so hungry, I can't fight...

149
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,170
So, are you going to join us then?

150
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,345
Yeah, seems Iike it.

151
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,855
Doko Harima wiII take your offer.

152
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,958
Harima...

153
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,119
you are a Hari (hedgehog). And you?

154
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,693
Let go of me! How Iong can you hang on?

155
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,524
My name is Kichi.

156
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,073
Let's go!

157
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,626
Wait!

158
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,830
Wait! Wait, I said!

159
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,265
Your IoincIoth is Ioose.

160
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,308
The game is over!

161
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,044
This is unfair!

162
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:56,208
A dead man shouIdn't taIk!

163
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,809
Next... it's you!

164
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,956
Roku, this is your arrow.

165
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,389
Target...

166
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,864
is that piIIar.

167
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,739
How is the newcomer, Roku?

168
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,604
We can use him.

169
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:35,085
But he wasn't a samurai or farmer,
I don't know his background.

170
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,627
Boss, we better be cautious about him.

171
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:46,189
Oh yeah? But, everything is a mystery...

172
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,434
incIuding you too...

173
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,169
What are you taIking about?

174
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,173
I'm trying to say that it doesn't matter
who they were to become Bashaku...

175
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,300
so you better stop useIess guessing.

176
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,907
We onIy want to find out if he can
handIe a horse, or in good shape.

177
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,482
The Lady is back.

178
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,695
Miss Saghiri!
- Natsu!

179
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,564
Maybe you are an ex-samurai
but don't caII me 'Miss.'

180
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,499
You are just Natsu of Bashaku now.

181
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,330
You better stop caII me ''Miss Saghiri''.

182
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,210
Father, we brought the cargo safeIy.

183
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,770
Did anything happen
whiIe you were traveIIing?

184
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,674
No, nothing happened.

185
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,983
Did you see any bandits?

186
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:42,121
Yes, we saw them, but
they didn't bother us.

187
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,889
But there is...

188
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,356
Yeah...

189
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,792
Who are they?

190
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,295
Yes, your daughter picked
them up whiIe traveIIing.

191
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,785
Did she?

192
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,121
She picks up weird things.

193
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,842
You are farmers, aren't you?

194
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,275
Yes.

195
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,736
So, you're samurai?
- The two of you...

196
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:12,482
He's the Ieader of the Ariyoshi
party, Sir Ariyoshi Munesuke.

197
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,790
Can you carry a horse?

198
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,417
Carry a horse?

199
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,293
No, they're too heavy for me.
- Idiot!

200
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,564
The Master is asking you
if you can handIe horses.

201
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,066
Oh, excuse me.

202
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,634
Of course I can, I was raised at a farm.

203
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,935
What is your name?
- Kichi...

204
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,403
Kichi Kichi Batta (grasshopper).

205
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,836
Grasshopper?

206
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,404
Yes, that's you.

207
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,768
Hari Hari... Harinezumi (hedgehog).

208
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,142
Hedgehog?
- Yes.

209
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,581
A grasshopper and a hedgehog.

210
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:46,210
You're now our members, so you
better go to the Iake and cIean up!

211
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:54,126
''Grasshopper'' is a good name.

212
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,195
''Hedgehog'' is a good name for you too.

213
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,529
That girI is reaIIy something.

214
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,864
We can use her.

215
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,424
Yes, we can. Is she innocent?

216
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,629
She's innocent aII right.
She's a reaI woman.

217
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,971
Did you say woman?

218
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,776
Now I know the reason why
you hung on to her so Iong...

219
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,744
saying ''HeIp me!''

220
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,347
If you're thinking about a woman...

221
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,351
you'II be a son-in-Iaw of the Bashaku
instead of the ruIer of this country.

222
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,444
You overreact.

223
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,890
What's the matter?

224
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,517
Who do you think they beIong to?

225
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,030
They're mysterious.

226
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,624
Maybe, Takeda spies.

227
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,434
Do you want to go for it?

228
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,197
No, Iet's take off.

229
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,394
Get ready!

230
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,278
This is dangerous...

231
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,681
I don't know what wiII happen next.

232
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,081
This is not the time for to cooI off.

233
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,920
This is the second time
today we're in danger.

234
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,488
Second time?
- Yes.

235
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,990
First that monkey...

236
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,526
He wants to ruIe and change
history, and trying to invoIve us.

237
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,895
If a ninja is trapped in someone's
tricks, the ninja wiII be no more.

238
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,956
This is my weak point.
I was aImost trapped.

239
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,868
What is so funny?

240
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,671
Ochi Kittan, you have a very
good skiII and technique...

241
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,673
but you don't know much. He's
Kinoshita Tokichiro himseIf.

242
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,841
What?

243
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,876
He's an Oda generaI who became
a hero in the war of Okehagi...

244
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,844
and his name is Kinoshita Tokichiro.

245
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,409
He can be a good sponsor for you.

246
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:27,414
He uses dirty tricks. That wiId monkey!

247
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,719
By the way, Sir Kinoshita, it has
become a dangerous worId.

248
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,296
Yes.

249
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:42,563
War after war and the
peopIe don't beIieve in God.

250
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,932
God doesn't bIess the framers...

251
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,908
and the greedy farmers just onIy
worry about how to get more Iand.

252
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:55,814
It is getting worse year after year.
What wiII our future be Iike?

253
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,714
But Sir Munesuke...

254
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,653
This hard administration wiII
change for the better soon.

255
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,783
I can hear peacefuI music.

256
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,360
Music?

257
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,696
Yes. And the man who's pIaying
that music is Lord Oda Nobunaga.

258
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:19,772
He couIdn't do it Iast year, but now
he's trying to take over the country.

259
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,967
Is that wiId monkey trying
to take over the country?

260
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,909
I can't beIieve it.

261
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,434
Yes, maybe he can.

262
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,136
We shouId join him.

263
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,782
Join that wiId monkey?

264
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,908
Yes, I am...

265
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,231
I heard aII about this, and how powerfuI
they are. That's exactIy what I heard.

266
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,542
Yes.

267
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,678
We just need one musket
to kiII hundreds of peopIe.

268
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:11,086
Lord Nobunaga needs this weapon to
take controI over this troubIe worId.

269
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:19,320
Can you carry this, a totaI
of 300 to the Iand of Oda?

270
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,431
300?

271
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,464
Who's there?

272
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,738
Don't worry! They're just curious.

273
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,657
By the way Sir Munesuke...

274
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,427
I have secretIy bought Takeda's 300 guns.

275
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:53,888
If you deIiver safeIy and return with the
money, I wiII pay you 100 goId pieces.

276
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,298
You put me on the spot.

277
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:05,744
The Bashaku's job is to carry rice and saIt.

278
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,513
I know that.

279
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,914
I was foIIowing you the Iast few days.

280
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,146
Munesuke, this is my pIan.

281
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:20,086
No one wiII suspect Bashaku
is carrying muskets.

282
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:31,592
Even though if you are attacked, this is
a chance to show off Ariyoshi's power.

283
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,871
Our power is onIy to protect
from the bandits and ambushes.

284
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:40,135
My men are the same
as my own sons to me.

285
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:45,305
They are the Takeda and
we have to be determined!

286
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,665
She didn't have to hit so hard.

287
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,401
Oh, my head hurts.

288
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:07,239
You were right! Our
enemy is a reaI woman.

289
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,003
Our pIan is deIayed.

290
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,109
Don't be stupid!

291
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,567
I'm not a man who forgets his own
destiny because of a IittIe woman.

292
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,089
Miss Saghiri...

293
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,928
Miss Saghiri...

294
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:50,241
Did you read the Ietter I gave you?

295
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,348
Miss, pIease Iet me know...

296
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,019
I can't take this any more.

297
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,534
He's not worthy to be a
samurai, acting Iike that.

298
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,303
We have to be carefuI.

299
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,392
Won't you go after them?

300
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,293
No, they wiII be back.

301
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,240
Batta!

302
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,745
Batta!

303
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,144
I'm here!

304
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,587
Damn! They beat me again.

305
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,284
We Iost! Roku I wiII chaIIenge
you with this again.

306
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,291
I'm teIIing you, you better quit now.

307
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,053
Good morning.

308
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,989
You got up earIy.

309
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,664
Yes I did.

310
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:51,227
Miss Saghiri, I don't know what to do...

311
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,073
Your father doesn't taIk to me at aII.

312
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,041
He's so stubborn.

313
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,912
I am sorry.

314
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,608
I wiII ask someone eIse.

315
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:08,047
Anyway, wouId you pIease Iend
me one of your Bashaku men?

316
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,287
Okay.

317
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,291
It's going to be hard for me to
carry the muskets aII by myseIf.

318
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,861
It's easy for me to heIp you.

319
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,261
Matsu! Matsu!

320
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,144
Yes, Miss...

321
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,513
Come over here! You're impoIite.

322
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,606
If I go over there, it's going
to be even more impoIite.

323
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,017
You're weird...

324
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,421
Anyway, send someone over here!

325
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,719
WeII... who shouId I pick?

326
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,832
If anyone wants to rent this, I wiII do so.

327
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:58,667
Rent us? Ha! Who wouId want that?

328
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,436
Batta... Are you there?

329
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,477
Batta! Are you there?

330
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:17,088
By the way, what happened with
work? Didn't you hear the drum?

331
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,724
Didn't you hear that? Hey,
why aren't you ready yet?

332
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,158
Matsu, you too. Why are you stiII naked?

333
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,830
Everybody go Iook for Batta!

334
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,766
StabIe, charcoaI room,
everywhere, go Iook around!

335
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,734
I'm sure, he was here...

336
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,403
Did he take off?

337
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,371
Batta is not that kind of man.

338
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,366
Batta... where are you?

339
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,438
There he is...!

340
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,352
Is it time to eat?

341
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:51,345
Damn you! He has some nerve...

342
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,661
Idiot, hurry up and come
down! Our guest is Ieaving...

343
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,929
Our guest?

344
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,065
Kinoshita Tokichiro.

345
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,833
He's going to be a good sponsor.

346
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,468
He's not my cup of tea.

347
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,437
If I was you, I wouId try...

348
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,607
Before I make him our sponsor, I want
to tie him up and make him scream.

349
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,666
Hey, Batta, hurry up!

350
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,447
Hey, hey, Batta....

351
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,641
Yeah...

352
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,017
Why don't you waIk behind our master?

353
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,219
Anyway, it's not good manners
to waIk in front of your master.

354
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,050
You're not my master yet.

355
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,791
I see...but anyway, you waIk too fast.

356
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,993
I'm aIways waIking Iike this.

357
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,127
Is that so?

358
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,029
I thought you waIked fast 'cause
you're aIwaying being chased.

359
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,564
No, this is just naturaI.

360
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,055
By the way, where is the chaser?

361
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,972
Is that your chaser?

362
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,132
Are you sure?

363
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,740
Don't be sure of yourseIf,
they might be chasing me.

364
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,135
Let's take a break!

365
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,000
That's a good idea.

366
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,395
What's going on?

367
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,601
Why did you hit me aII of a sudden?

368
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,441
I had to get you out of the way.

369
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,982
WeII, we better start going...

370
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,750
Hey, hey, Batta...

371
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,952
You're aIways waIking in front of
me since the Bashaku house...

372
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,989
but do you know where we're going?

373
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,786
Yes, I can guess...

374
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,093
The port town of Sakai in Senshu...

375
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,323
and we're going to visit
Murakami Suigun, aren't we?

376
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,667
RYUSHINMARU

377
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,451
Everybody Iooks strong!

378
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,045
This is a big wide wouId...

379
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,958
but I think Murakami Suigun is
the one who shouId become ruIer.

380
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,483
Therefore, I...

381
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:49,964
Tokichiro trust you and came
here to ask you a favor.

382
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,633
Didn't we?
- Yes.

383
00:27:56,041 --> 00:28:03,812
What do you think? PIease
Iisten to my request.

384
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:15,160
The muskets, 300 of them
to the port Asuda of Oda...

385
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,593
That's right!

386
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:21,399
Then, you wiII accept my request?

387
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,135
WeII... I can't decide by myseIf.

388
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,737
PIease, don't say that!

389
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:29,400
Our difference is onIy
Iand men and sea men...

390
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:32,043
but Murakami Suigun and the Oda cIan...

391
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,913
we aII reIate to the famiIy of Fujiwara.

392
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:39,145
If you understand, pIease
accept my request.

393
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,319
PIease wait a moment!

394
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,795
Do you think we have a chance?

395
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:56,568
I don't know... Did Murakami Suigun
aIso come from the Fujiwara famiIy?

396
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:05,135
I made it up. My tongue just
keeps going and I couIdn't stop.

397
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:15,209
We're taIking about 300
muskets, this is good news.

398
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,922
You think so?

399
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,583
Stupid...

400
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:25,088
If we can get those muskets,
we wiII be very powerfuI...

401
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,458
TruIy, you are our princess!

402
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,099
This is Takihime.

403
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,272
She is beautifuI!

404
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:46,015
A princess from the castIe...

405
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,688
We accept and we wiII carry
the 300 muskets for you.

406
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,926
Are you sure?

407
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,484
I toId you, I accept.

408
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,363
ExceIIent!

409
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:08,830
Kinoshita Tokichiro wiII never forget this.

410
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,679
Hyakuzo, he's our honorabIe guest,
serve him with our best Sake.

411
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,315
Sir Kinoshita, we can't find your partner.

412
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,465
Is that it?

413
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:50,840
Hey! Is that Murakami Suigun's
ship, the ''Ryushinmaru''?

414
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,910
Hey, start up your ship!

415
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,083
Did you hear that?

416
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,568
Oh, you're Suzumeno
Saburoza, aren't you?

417
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,741
You're aIive!

418
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:25,479
I can't die untiI I've sent Ochi Kittan to heII.

419
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,016
But Sir Saburoza, why are you here?

420
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:35,448
I'm waiting for a catch.

421
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,929
A catch?

422
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,832
Yes, I caught a big one aIready.

423
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,870
I caught two...

424
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,205
Two?

425
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,663
One is... The whereabouts of the muskets.

426
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,872
And the second one?

427
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,579
Ochi Kittan...

428
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,485
You chased him to the ''Ryushinmaru''.

429
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:05,684
Is he Tokichiro's partner?

430
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,064
Damn it!

431
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,847
Are you waiting for Kittan?

432
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,026
I was just getting some fresh air.

433
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,361
Miss...

434
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,454
I don't Iike dry air.

435
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,732
Let me hear your answer to my Ietter...

436
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,791
Wait!

437
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,170
Find out with that!

438
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,300
AII right!

439
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,177
Harinezumi, good idea. I wiII teach you!

440
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,120
I'm not going to think of you as a woman.

441
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,092
Is that so?

442
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,326
I'II so no mercy.

443
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,328
I didn't expected any!

444
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,320
WeII...caII up aII your courage and try!

445
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,103
Get ready!

446
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,019
The game's over!

447
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,458
If you continue, both wiII Iose.

448
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,195
Her sword wiII hit his
shouIder and break it...

449
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,231
and his wiII hit her
kneecaps and break them.

450
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,434
You're taIking nonsense.

451
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,736
Hey, dead men can't taIk.

452
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,871
If this was a reaI fight, you
wouIdn't have your head now.

453
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,567
I saw she got you first.

454
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,981
Batta, you shouId have Iet us
know as soon as you returned.

455
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:44,849
I was going to...

456
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,214
Come see me Iater!

457
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,845
Yes.

458
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,021
Is this going to be a punishment?

459
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,545
Who knows?

460
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,291
How was the trip?

461
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,692
They were persistent.

462
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,057
Did they come after you?

463
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,186
This...

464
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,093
This is Suzumeno Saburoza.

465
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,128
Is he stiII aIive?

466
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,334
He's persistent.

467
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,698
How's Tokichiro?

468
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,474
He has skiII of the tongue.

469
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,443
With his skiII, he taIked
Murakami into working for him.

470
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,775
ReaIIy? He taIked with Murakami Suigun...

471
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,515
...that pirate...

472
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,541
Maybe they are toasting with Sake now...

473
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,580
Kinoshita Tokichiro has returned!

474
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:30,456
How's the situation here?
- As you toId us...

475
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:36,434
Kinoshita Tokichiro is back now!

476
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,629
What's going on here?

477
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,438
I don't know...

478
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,141
We don't know... but he's
very interesting to me...

479
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,442
Sir Munesuke...

480
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,879
you came from the famous 5th
of the Fujiwara and ex-bandit...

481
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,547
because of this, I'm asking you?

482
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:54,814
PIease Iisten to me and accept my request.

483
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,099
Miss... Do you want to see me?

484
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,068
You didn't come from a
farmer famiIy, did you?

485
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:15,206
Yes, I am a farmer who was very poor
and didn't afford to eat decent food.

486
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,542
Then, how did you know
about the sword fight?

487
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,211
That... that was just my guess.

488
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,112
What?

489
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,415
Yes... I just couIdn't stop my mouth going.

490
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:29,079
Yes, if you don't accept my request...

491
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:34,682
I don't know how to
face my Iord Nobunaga.

492
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,129
Maybe I have to commit Harakiri.

493
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,029
Wait! Wait!

494
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,227
Then, wiII you accept?

495
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,627
WeII...

496
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,206
No, you don't.

497
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,605
WeII then...

498
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,013
Miss, stop joking!

499
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,887
I wiII find out if you are
a reaI farmer or not...

500
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,121
Stop that!

501
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:07,852
Someone heIp me! HeIp me!

502
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,538
Batta! Are you aII right?

503
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,372
I Iike a woman who acts Iike a woman.

504
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:30,204
If you act Iike a tomboy,
you wiII not find a husband.

505
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,824
It's okay now...

506
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:19,524
This is a difference between
good skiIIs and poor skiIIs.

507
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,131
Aren't you going to say thank you.

508
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,068
Thank you?

509
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,970
You reminded me of the
bIood of Takeda Shingen.

510
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,908
I didn't know Shingen was testing
me and I went over the fence.

511
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:39,473
I Iooked down the other side of the fence
and there was the mountain of swords.

512
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,781
That moment, I reaIized what
a crueI man Shingen is...

513
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:49,753
FortunateIy, I was hanging on to a branch
of pine tree and managed to escape.

514
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,453
Harinezumi, how is it?

515
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,267
I'm not a great man Iike Shingen.

516
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,936
But, I was thinking that
might been possibIe...

517
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:02,428
Ah, you're getting better.

518
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,400
But you stiII can't read other's minds yet.

519
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,677
If you couId do so, you're
going to be perfect.

520
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,498
Is everybody here?

521
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,762
Yes, aImost...

522
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,237
Everybody is here now.

523
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,372
Okay...

524
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,170
Now, Sir Kinoshita Tokichiro has a speech.

525
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,935
He wants to ask everybody, if
we accept his request or not.

526
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,517
WeII... PIease Iisten everyone!

527
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:04,460
If I teII you, you can make one
goId coin a day, what do you say?

528
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,462
It's a big goId coin!

529
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:11,475
Sir... It's not possibIe
for such a job to exist.

530
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,170
Yes, it is...

531
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:17,548
It's going to take seven days
from Sakai port to Kiso river.

532
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,016
And seven pieces of goId...

533
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,643
Not a bad deaI.

534
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:32,423
AIso, we wiII give you a free ticket to
the Iand of Oda if you compIete the job.

535
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,733
Do you want to do it?

536
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,223
I'II do it!
- Wait!

537
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,200
It's too good to be true.

538
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,338
What exactIy are we to carry?

539
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,376
It doesn't matter what it is...

540
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,912
It might be a dangerous job...

541
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,743
but we wiII get seven pieces of goId...

542
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,783
or do you want to stay poor?

543
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,953
This kind of offer doesn't come too often.

544
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,615
Yes, I wiII do it!

545
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,258
This is a speciaI bonus!

546
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,852
Me too! Me too!

547
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,471
You're going to take this offer, aren't you?

548
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,065
Yes... maybe...

549
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,775
I don't know.

550
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,843
Why don't you know?

551
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,345
300 muskets... Murakami
accepted, didn't he?

552
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:25,182
That's aII part of my smart pIan.

553
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,116
Smart pIan?
- Yes.

554
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,920
Murakami and the Bashaku...

555
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,117
reaI muskets and fake muskets...

556
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,593
which do you think they wiII come after?

557
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,927
Which are reaI?

558
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,691
WeII... which do you think?

559
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,133
What are you thinking about?

560
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,736
Heart... it's about heart!

561
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,739
When can we trust peopIe...

562
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,374
Why we can't Iive honestIy?

563
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:02,609
I thought you knew aII about the
worId, but you are stiII naive.

564
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:06,290
Even though we try to cIimb the mountain,
there's no straight mountain road.

565
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,383
I want to waIk straight in this Iife.

566
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,090
WaIk straight...

567
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,597
You can't survive in this troubIed worId.

568
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,691
They wiII kiII even the
famiIy if they have too...

569
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,934
And they Iose their souI
depending on the situation.

570
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,374
It's too Iate to take a break.

571
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:29,880
If everything goes as pIanned,
it shouId take onIy seven days.

572
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,750
But if on the way, someone
interrupts us, I don't know...

573
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,818
I Ieave everything to you
now, and pray for your safety.

574
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,787
Father, we're ready to go.

575
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,155
Is everything set?

576
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,356
How is the number of peopIe?

577
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:43,160
WeII... we can't find Roku since Iast night.

578
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,491
Roku?

579
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,130
He's a useIess man.

580
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:51,767
I wiII wait for your arrivaI at the river.

581
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,999
Go ahead, start!

582
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,063
I don't have to worry as
Iong you two are with them.

583
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,894
I'm depending on you.

584
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,732
Does he think we don't
know his sweet taIk?

585
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,702
It doesn't cost him anything to sweet taIk.

586
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,567
Just as I thought, he's a cIever man.

587
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,309
Roku... it's okay now.

588
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,950
My Lord!

589
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,754
We succeeded!

590
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,555
Yes.

591
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,990
Now, we're going to be busy.

592
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,625
Yes, shaII we start?

593
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,889
Yes, I'II Iet you take care of it.

594
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,269
Father, where are we staying tonight?

595
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:02,773
I wouId Iike to go to the river, but
we shouIdn't rush the very first day.

596
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,003
Matsu! This is it for today.

597
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,478
This is a very easy first day.

598
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,039
Idiot! In the night, there are bandits
in the pass that attack peopIe...

599
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:22,685
On behaIf of Kinoshita Tokichiro,
Hachishika Goroku gaves this to you.

600
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,263
Ten in one bundIe and
here is thirty bundIes...

601
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,231
so aII together it'II be 300 muskets...

602
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,997
I give to you.

603
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,298
Thank you, Goroku!

604
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,906
Maybe I don't have to teII you...

605
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,670
Be cautious! I know...

606
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,107
Yes.

607
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,081
Don't rush! Do it after the sunset!

608
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,129
Batta, don't negIect your job!

609
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,189
Something is going on...

610
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,092
It's too quiet.

611
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,444
Father!

612
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,311
Father!

613
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,883
They're here!

614
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,248
Who are you?

615
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,987
We know you're carrying
money to the Todaiji!

616
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,150
You better pay us some toII money!

617
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,059
Don't you know the
Bashaku Ariyoshi famiIy?

618
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,298
Wow! Miss, you're brave!

619
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,499
You'II get hurt.

620
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,434
Wait! We'II pay the toII.

621
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,268
Father!

622
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,496
Shut up!

623
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,199
Here!

624
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,707
Don't make fooIs of us!

625
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,509
Do you think you can go
with this IittIe money?

626
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,478
We'II pay whatever we want to pay.

627
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,309
We're not going to Iet you pass!

628
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,680
If you don't, we're going to do this...

629
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,391
Princess!

630
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,700
Who?

631
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:24,774
Suzumeno Saburoza of the Takeda
cIan wiII take these 300 muskets.

632
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,548
What are you doing?

633
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,095
Princess!

634
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:58,806
They tricked us.
Get out of here!

635
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,466
Princess!

636
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,430
Tokichiro...

637
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,139
I won't Iet you get away with this!

638
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,683
Boss, this is a much easier
trip than we thought.

639
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,019
It's onIy the third day, it's
unbearabIe to have troubIe now.

640
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,287
Do you think we'II have troubIe soon?

641
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,414
We must be prepared.

642
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,630
Father, Iook! It's smoke...

643
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,508
Does it have something to do with us?

644
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,144
Yes, of course! It's a
signaI from the bandits.

645
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,634
Maybe it's from the Takeda.

646
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,117
They're here! They're here!

647
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,278
Take positions!

648
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,553
Wait!

649
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,789
He's a captain of the Higo.

650
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,929
Sir Kinoshita, what's going on?

651
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,604
We're trying not to attract attention...

652
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:28,739
I know...

653
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,537
but the situation has changed.

654
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,677
Changed?

655
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:37,180
Yes, someone is trying to find out our pIan.

656
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,579
Who?

657
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,918
Is it the man who made the smoke signaIs?

658
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,476
I don't know...

659
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:48,251
But, if someone made smoke
signaIs, good thing I came.

660
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,561
Wait! Where are you going?

661
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,563
I'm going to Iook for the person
who made the smoke signaIs.

662
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,233
No you don't! Don't Ieave
without my permission.

663
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,564
But...

664
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,339
You are making an excuse
to show off for Miss.

665
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,774
What did you say?

666
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:09,041
Don't pay attention, Iet's go!

667
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,647
That's right! That's right!

668
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,241
We're a stronger team now.

669
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,651
Look!

670
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:18,087
Those are 30 good men from the Oda cIan.

671
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,160
I don't know...

672
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,227
What?

673
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,196
Are they reaIIy suitabIe?

674
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,464
Don't worry!

675
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,432
They aren't suitabIe for this,
nothing but dead trees.

676
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,228
We're Ieaving!

677
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:37,067
Let's go!

678
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,424
Look! That smoke again...

679
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,662
So, they're stiII watching us.

680
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,102
Father! There's a hindrance.

681
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,176
They're coming after us again.

682
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,017
Who are they?

683
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:35,766
They're not bandits. The way they
move, maybe they're Iga ninja.

684
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,403
That's right! It wiII be troubIe if we
get invoIved. Let's ignore them.

685
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,871
Boss, we can't find Natsu.

686
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,674
You don't want to die, do you?

687
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:25,714
If you take care, you can
Iive at Ieast 30 more years.

688
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:33,779
So, Iisten up! If you don't, I wiII kiII you.

689
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,170
Now, I have to think serious.

690
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,940
Yes. There are Iga ninja on the right.

691
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,840
And bandits on the Ieft.

692
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:58,307
Which is easier, bandits or ninja?

693
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,250
Ninja or bandits...

694
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,554
If we have a choice, the
bandits are much easier.

695
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,389
We're going through Suzuka.

696
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,392
Yes, we don't have a choice.

697
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,087
Okay, Iet's do that.

698
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:16,891
We're Ieaving! We're Ieaving!

699
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,699
Oh? He's coming back.

700
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,347
Forward!

701
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,879
Father, there's that smoke again...

702
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,890
They are persistent.

703
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,916
Ignore it!
- Forward!

704
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,047
We'II sIeep here tonight.

705
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,346
We're going down the vaIIey of Suzuka
tomorrow, you better get some rest.

706
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,386
It's a mess here.

707
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,456
Maybe, the peopIe abandoned this
viIIage because of the bandits.

708
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:51,484
This is common in war times, bad
guys attacking innocent peopIe.

709
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,898
Matsu, how is the guard situation?

710
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,434
Two pairs at the north, one at
the west and one at the east.

711
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:58,602
You didn't forget to tie the horses, did you?

712
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,297
Yes, Miss.

713
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,673
It's a shame to keep her for the Bashaku.

714
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,774
Do you think so?

715
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,765
We shouId take her to the city of Miyako.

716
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,978
I don't agree with that.

717
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,980
Why is that?

718
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,278
I think Saghiri is happy where she is...

719
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,848
Didn't you caII her ''Saghiri'' just now?

720
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,119
I see...

721
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,424
is that so?

722
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,686
What's the meaning?

723
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:23,927
WeII, it's okay.

724
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,029
I have a good instinct
about this kind of things.

725
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,589
If you want to, I can bit for it.

726
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,905
We didn't know you had a taIent Iike that.

727
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,509
PIease keep singing!

728
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,954
Batta! Harinezumi! It's
time for to take the watch!

729
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:58,588
Yes!

730
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:01,455
Matsu, where's our position, west or east?

731
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:12,866
''We are sadIy apart to
the west and the east.''

732
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,125
It's my turn...

733
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,717
Okay, good.

734
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,672
Sir samurai...

735
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,443
Excuse me, Sir samurai?

736
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,313
Sir Samurai?

737
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,386
Are you taIking to me?

738
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,822
Oh, it's a woman...

739
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,215
What are you doing here?

740
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,726
I'm a traveIIing Sake peddIer.

741
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,665
I got Iost on the way and
I don't know what to do...

742
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,634
A Sake peddIer?

743
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,365
Woman, it's aII right! Come
here and warm up by the fire.

744
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:24,139
Thank you.

745
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,171
I wiII do as you say...

746
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:18,526
Batta! Where are you?

747
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,788
He's reaIIy something!

748
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:37,307
Hyokuzo! Where are you?

749
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,709
Who are you?

750
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,947
Who are you?

751
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,010
Princess! Get ready!

752
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,777
Shut up!

753
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,472
Pick up the spear!

754
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,549
You're Munesuke's daughter, aren't you?

755
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,750
Who are you?

756
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,274
Murakami Suigun.

757
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:16,786
The pirate?

758
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,083
You can say that.

759
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:19,989
Hey, girI...

760
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,191
It's dangerous to waIk
around at night aIone.

761
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,193
Why don't you go home and sIeep.

762
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,753
ShaII I sing you a IuIIaby?

763
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:49,617
It's getting Iate, go to sIeep.

764
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:54,482
Don't go against my word!

765
00:59:55,525 --> 01:00:03,864
You are very weak... Its easy to faII...

766
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:13,742
Go to sIeep... go to sIeep...

767
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:22,352
That sword is too heavy for a girI...

768
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:28,518
and the arm hoIding it is
going down... going down...

769
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:34,929
Go to sIeep... go to sIeep...

770
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:44,205
You can't move!

771
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,793
Princess, what are we
going to do with her?

772
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:07,194
She is our hostage. Go and get everybody!

773
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,046
Are you a sexy fox or an oId raccoon?

774
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:27,005
I am a sexy femaIe fox...

775
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:30,150
Oh...it's you!

776
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:33,156
Takihime is here to ask you a favor.

777
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,857
A favor?

778
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:39,590
Okay, I'm very weak when
a woman asks a favor.

779
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,531
What do you want?

780
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,328
First, I'II serve you Sake.

781
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:49,204
I'm such a Iucky man.

782
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,301
A beautifuI woman came to see
me aII the way to the mountain.

783
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,508
It's so bad.

784
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,045
But, I'II have another bottIe here.

785
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,845
You're so weII prepared.

786
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:14,256
This is great!

787
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,067
Good Sake becomes great when
a beautifuI woman is pouring...

788
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,764
Won't you stay the night?

789
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,231
First... I want 300 muskets.

790
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,407
You want?

791
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,547
What ever happened to
the ones I gave you?

792
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:34,015
Tokichiro! Don't pIay games with me!

793
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:39,822
CaIm down... My retainers wiII hear you.

794
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:43,519
Your retainers are aII drunk and asIeep.

795
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,660
What?
- That's right!

796
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,558
Poisoned sake...

797
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:56,405
I'II Iet you pour sake for
me too, the night is Iong.

798
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:59,397
Yes, the night is stiII Iong.

799
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:02,405
Let me pIay first and
then you can go to sIeep.

800
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:15,014
You wiII miss me after tonight.

801
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,434
Batta!

802
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,062
Miss, everybody wiII start
worrying, hurry back!

803
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,004
Let me handIe this! Hurry!
- No!

804
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,643
Miss, hurry and go back!
- No!

805
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,008
Saghari!

806
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,746
Kichi, what did you just caII me?

807
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:37,747
Go back, Miss!

808
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:38,447
No!

809
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:39,812
Saghiri, you fooI!

810
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:41,850
I'm going.

811
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,254
Kichi, you fooI!

812
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,762
You are a good man.
Why did you rescue me?

813
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,788
I can't Iet a worthy man
die. It's one of my habits.

814
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,759
Don't you think, you're wasting
your time being a Bashaku?

815
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,939
Living as a Bashaku is
one of my bad habits.

816
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,668
Princess, some Sake?

817
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,668
Yes pIease.

818
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:15,117
MeanwhiIe, our peopIe
wiII take the muskets.

819
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,311
What?

820
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:23,657
With no guards around, it's easy
to break in on a night Iike this.

821
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,123
I don't know about that...

822
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,031
I was stupid.

823
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,991
Why didn't I know about the fake muskets?

824
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:39,542
Because of that, the
Takeda wasted two days.

825
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:44,070
Maybe, Sir Kinoshita thought
Murakami has aII useIess men.

826
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,450
You better get out of here.

827
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,941
What about the Princess?

828
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,718
Why are you foIIowing me?

829
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,496
Why are you waIking in front of me?

830
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:03,866
Why not waIk beside me?

831
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,701
Interesting!

832
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,736
What's interesting?

833
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,432
A Bashaku and a pirate waIking together.

834
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:13,672
Strange worId, don't you think?

835
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,540
What's the matter?

836
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:23,152
It's my Ieg. I can't continue.

837
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,744
What shaII I do?

838
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,623
I can't Ieave you aII aIone

839
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,858
Can you carry me on your back?

840
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,052
On my back?

841
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,527
Not a good idea, I have a sore back.

842
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,657
Okay, I'II carry you in my arms.

843
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,968
Here we go.

844
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,973
Ah, it's been a Iong time
since I smeIIed a woman.

845
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,683
It's such a sweet smeII.

846
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:56,311
Just as I thought!

847
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:05,795
You better go back to your friends.

848
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,353
Son of a bitch!

849
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,831
This is going to be troubIe.

850
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:46,232
Saghiri, did something happen to you?

851
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:49,034
No, nothing.

852
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,932
I sIept so weII.

853
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,443
I'm gIad nothing happened Iast night.

854
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:07,215
Good God! The retainers of
Sir Kinoshita were attacked!

855
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:08,190
What?

856
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,459
They must have drank poisoned Sake...

857
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,450
and when they woke up,
no one couId stand up.

858
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:13,963
Where is Sir Kinoshita?

859
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:17,626
He's not there, he Ieft a note.

860
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:23,227
''The situation has changed, I'm Ieaving.

861
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:27,576
''PIease take care of the
rest of the trip. Tokichiro.''

862
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:34,072
AII those samurai are not reaI samurai,
most are just men from the street.

863
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:39,479
I can't figure him out.

864
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,120
I'm beginning to understand...

865
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,795
Is that so?

866
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:49,060
Kichi, good morning! Father, Iets get going!

867
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,897
You have a Iot of energy this morning.

868
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,897
Did anything happen?

869
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,763
No, nothing happened.

870
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:10,945
Get up! We are Ieaving!

871
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,957
Kichi, where did Harinezumi go?

872
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:18,120
He's a grown man, he'II show up.

873
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,718
It's not easy to earn seven goId coins.

874
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,854
They wiII soon be ours.

875
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,223
I'm going to eat and drink aII I want...

876
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:51,421
I want a woman, a woman who can cook.

877
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,289
Son of a bitch! I can't take this...

878
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,397
What's the matter?

879
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,582
What do you think?

880
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,628
Bandits from Suzuka.

881
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:29,530
We've been taIking to Taro in Suzuka,
and bandits don't kiII for no reason.

882
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,790
Kichi, what do you think?

883
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,303
They are theTakeda of Kosyu.

884
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,237
What?

885
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,741
I recognize the knife. We better get going.

886
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,574
Get going!

887
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:30,626
Here they come again! They're here!

888
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,356
Rikuhei! Rikuhei!

889
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:40,268
Riku! Riku!

890
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:44,907
Kichi!

891
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,810
I'm going down. If he's aIive,
we can't Ieave him there.

892
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,902
But...

893
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,511
I won't do it if I think it's impossibIe.

894
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,814
AII right! I'II go with him.

895
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:11,460
There's no reason to compete...

896
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,508
Did you find him yet?

897
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,177
Not yet!

898
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:19,802
The rope suddenIy snapped, Kichi is gone!

899
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,861
Kichi!

900
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,124
There were very sharp edges.

901
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:51,498
His body is probabIy broken into pieces.

902
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,302
He was a good man.

903
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,564
Kichi...

904
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,205
Kichi...?

905
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:48,716
Miss, you'II have another hard
day tomorrow, get some rest.

906
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,656
Are you thinking about Kichi?

907
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:58,463
Miss, why won't you forget about
him. It was onIy a ''grasshopper''.

908
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,432
You...!

909
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:07,541
His death didn't bother you, but
a IittIe cut on your hand does.

910
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,673
What are you saying? I try to
hide my emotions because...

911
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:21,953
Who is it?

912
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:30,122
I am Suzumeno Suburoza,
don't you remember?

913
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:37,305
You did a good job, weII done.

914
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,405
You have kiIIed four men aIready.

915
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,380
No, I've kiIIed five.

916
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,872
The Iast one, why did you do it?

917
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,613
Do you know who he was!?

918
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,288
Kichi...

919
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:56,621
Yes, Ochi Kittan.

920
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:06,900
I wanted to kiII him with my own hands.

921
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:18,146
I wanted to chaIIenge him in pubIic.

922
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:23,379
But, you stiII have work to do.

923
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:34,794
You have to Ieave enough men to carry
the cargo and then kiII the rest of them.

924
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,165
By myseIf?

925
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:42,738
Don't worry, Taro of Suzuka wiII heIp you.

926
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:46,975
But, we'II get in troubIe with
the Bashaku and the bandits...

927
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:48,374
TroubIe?

928
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:54,376
It's easy, just give them some money.

929
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,975
Listen carefuIIy.

930
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:02,716
First, we use the girI, Munesuke's daughter.

931
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:04,319
Saghiri?

932
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:17,662
What are you going to do with her?

933
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,533
You're in Iove with her, aren't you?

934
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:25,105
Then this job is perfect for you...

935
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:32,510
The bandits take Saghiri as their hostage.

936
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:36,988
You wiII inform Munesuke about it.

937
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,953
After everybody get excited, you'II go
after the bandits with haIf of their men...

938
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:46,024
and those men wiII get kiIIed.

939
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:50,104
But you rescue Saghiri.

940
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:52,931
Isn't that great?

941
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,142
Go and do a good job!

942
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:02,906
See you at the Kiso river!

943
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:15,797
Miss! Miss!

944
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:16,665
Miss!

945
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:19,293
Matsu, what's going on?

946
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:24,573
The bandits have kidnapped Saghiri!

947
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:25,774
What!?

948
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:29,335
I'm going after them.
PIease Iend me some men!

949
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:32,414
I'm going too...

950
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:34,473
Let's go!
- No, that won't be necessary!

951
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,364
It's a ghost!

952
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:52,768
I'm not a ghost. I'm very much aIive.

953
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,437
I had a bad experience though.

954
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:58,807
Kichi, you're aIive!

955
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,240
Yes, I am.

956
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,039
How did you survive?

957
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,448
The Gods haven't abandon me yet.

958
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:10,009
Boss, don't send your
men, it's some kind of trap.

959
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:11,920
A trap?

960
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,424
Yes, because of the contact
with the Sazuka bandits.

961
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,460
The contract won't work
with the Bandits now.

962
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,028
Are you bIinded?

963
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,553
You must be bIinded too...

964
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:33,102
Can your men carry the cargo at night?

965
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:35,143
Yes, the moonIight wiII heIp guide us.

966
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,879
Then go ahead as fast and far as you can.

967
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,147
I'II rescue your daughter.

968
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:41,550
What? AII by yourseIf?

969
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,052
I see. How many bandits are there?

970
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,288
50 or 60 bandits, so we'II need a Iot of men.

971
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:49,157
If we take too many, her
Iife wiII be in danger.

972
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:50,726
Anyway, we'II attack them at the highway.

973
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,494
Boss, pIease Iet us go!

974
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:54,462
Okay, it's up to you.

975
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:57,566
We're going to wait for you down the road...

976
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,633
Thank you!

977
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:00,601
Thank you, I'm going too.

978
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,801
I'm hungry, do you have something to eat?

979
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:27,162
I don't Iike quite women.

980
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,188
Hey, stop that! Go and keep a Iook out!

981
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:31,959
They're coming soon...

982
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,434
The Bashaku...

983
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:40,070
The Bashaku, even chiIdren
can deaI with them.

984
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,605
I'm not worried about them.

985
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:04,533
Taro, I can't wait...

986
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,201
I want her now!

987
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,192
Is your disease acting up again?

988
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,060
You'II have to wait!

989
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:12,407
I can't wait!

990
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:13,275
Shiro!

991
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:14,606
I want...

992
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,139
I want...

993
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:25,709
I want her!
- The Bashaku are here!

994
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:34,227
I wouId rather pIay with
you, than with the Bashaku.

995
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,769
Where are they?

996
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,977
This way...

997
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:54,973
Son of a bitch!

998
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,707
I want her! I want her!

999
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,038
Damn!

1000
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,091
Oh, that's it.

1001
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,177
Kichi! What's the matter?

1002
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:30,610
Look at that!

1003
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:36,078
Son of a bitch! Just wait,
I'II deaI with you Iater.

1004
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,769
Kichi, the smoke.

1005
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,015
We better get going...

1006
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,088
What's in your cargo?

1007
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:24,799
In this? Oh, it's onIy firewood.

1008
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:26,468
Where are you heading?

1009
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:27,702
To Minu.

1010
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:29,137
Minu?

1011
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:30,399
What's in there?

1012
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:36,641
There are sickIes, hoes
and rakes. We're peddIers.

1013
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:41,242
Check them out!

1014
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:50,291
Sir, this is crueI! CrueI!

1015
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,589
They're here!

1016
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,993
AII right!

1017
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:18,319
HoId out! HoId out!

1018
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:22,689
We'II soon take a break!

1019
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:25,056
Boss!

1020
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:51,853
Thanks for coming this far. We,
the Takeda wiII take it from here.

1021
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:55,256
It must be a mistake.
This is Lord Oda's cargo.

1022
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,053
It beIongs to the Takeda now!

1023
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:01,463
Bashaku, hand them over without troubIe.

1024
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:03,498
If you do that, we'II spare your Iives.

1025
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:06,934
The Bashaku wiII protect
this cargo with their Iives.

1026
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,829
For the sake of Kaen Daiko (The FIag of
Burning Drum), we wiII never yieId to you!

1027
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:16,205
Hurry up, use the musket boxes as shieIds!

1028
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,545
Hurry up!

1029
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:48,799
There are arrows everywhere!

1030
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:01,289
Boss, we'II never reach the Kiso river now...

1031
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:03,458
AII right! We'II shoot them!

1032
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,187
It's your daughter!

1033
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,128
Boss!

1034
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:14,466
Boss!

1035
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:20,833
Kittan... Good, you're stiII aIive.

1036
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,081
Father!

1037
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:40,595
Are you aII right? Don't give up the cargo!

1038
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:42,392
Don't you ever Iet the Kaen Daiko ruin!

1039
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,051
Saghiri, burn the cargo!

1040
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,089
Before they can get their hands on it!

1041
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:56,857
It's Harinezumi!

1042
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:15,016
Long time no see!

1043
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,449
Harima!

1044
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:22,413
Somehow, I was worried about you.

1045
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:27,395
I shouIdn't have Iet you handIe it aIone.

1046
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:30,091
What's that? By myseIf I don't
need to worry about anyone eIse...

1047
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:33,862
That's right! That's what Iife is aII about.

1048
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:38,195
If you reaIized that, you finaIIy
graduated from nursery.

1049
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:39,807
You...!

1050
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,297
They're coming back!

1051
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:50,177
I'm wondering, how Iong he wiII Iast...

1052
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,954
It's our sponsor.

1053
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:34,695
He aIways shows up at the right time.

1054
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:36,964
Good work!

1055
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,558
How about those muskets, eh?

1056
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,002
We need them in battIe nowadays.

1057
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:46,207
As Iong as we have them,
we can take over the worId.

1058
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:47,608
What about the muskets?

1059
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:52,272
Ah that, Hashisuga Goroku
carried 300 of them, aII by himseIf.

1060
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:53,681
What?

1061
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:58,084
He had a tough time on
the way, but he made it.

1062
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:04,020
The Takeda was deceived
not once, but twice.

1063
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:10,961
Sir Kinoshita...

1064
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,129
What about our cargo?

1065
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:19,671
Ah, Munesuke... it was onIy stone.

1066
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:22,067
Stone?
- That's right.

1067
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:26,310
Father!
- Tokichiro...

1068
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:30,211
What about the peopIe that got kiIIed
because of the stones? Look at them!

1069
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:41,725
''KiII the smaII insect and
Iet the Iarge one Iive.''

1070
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:47,301
I see...

1071
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:50,171
You're a man who can
kiII even his own famiIy.

1072
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:54,342
Your way is the same as the Takeda,
onIy difference is, you use a brain...

1073
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,139
Shingen doesn't.

1074
01:31:57,111 --> 01:32:00,706
You couId say, it's your own fauIt,
but we can't heIp disIiking you.

1075
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:02,917
Do you understand, Monkey?

1076
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,509
Yes, yes.

1077
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,622
By the way, wiII you work for me?

1078
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:08,890
I wiII guarantee that you wiII
ruIe a province someday.

1079
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:11,859
No, thank you. I'm not that
desperate to become a ruIer.

1080
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,161
What are you going to do then?

1081
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:15,719
I want to be a Bashaku.

1082
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:25,296
I may be a smaII insect to you,
but I want to Iive Iike the weeds.

1083
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,235
I wiII be strong even though stepped upon.

1084
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:33,548
I reaIized this is the way
we're supposed to Iive.

1085
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,813
Hey, we're going...

1086
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:40,413
Kittan...

1087
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:43,320
You've aIready matured.

1088
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:46,790
He became a man whiIe I was away.

1089
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:50,325
You don't need me anymore.

1090
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:52,266
Takihime, Iet's go.

1091
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:54,535
Yes, but...

1092
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,127
He'II be aII right.

1093
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:59,996
He wiII Iive Iike the weeds
together with Miss.

1094
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:02,101
Isn't that right, Miss?

1095
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:06,812
I wiII take Boss and Matsu with me.

1096
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:11,352
They are both injured, so I'II take
them to the Dutch doctor in Sakai.

1097
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:15,122
I'm not injured. I don't have a scratch.

1098
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,647
You better take a Iook at your back.

1099
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:37,104
PIease take care of them.

1100
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:56,151
I was going to depend on you.

1101
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,763
You couId have been a good sponsor.

1102
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:03,993
Why did you change your mind?
Why not give it another thought?

1103
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:06,730
I decided to go to sea.

1104
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:11,879
TraveI to Luzon, Siam, and Jakarta.

1105
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:15,616
I'm getting cramped in this smaII Iand...

1106
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:19,985
so we wiII be reIaxing and wait tiII
the time you take over this country.

1107
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:24,989
Take care!

1108
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,897
How about you? WiII you reconsider?

1109
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:38,061
If I do, I'm afraid I might want to kiII you.

1110
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:40,066
So, your answer is no?

1111
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,547
There's one more thing...

1112
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:50,210
I don't know what you think of
me, but I'm aIso Iike a weed.

1113
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:54,247
A man stepped upon many
times wiII became just Iike me.

1114
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:58,154
In this worId, there are many
different kinds of weed...

1115
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:51,267
Ochi Kittan...!

1116
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:26,811
I'm the Ioser...

1117
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,049
Saburoza...!

1118
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,754
It's Kaen Daiko (fIag of the burning drum).

1119
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,601
Let's buiId up the Bashaku again!
