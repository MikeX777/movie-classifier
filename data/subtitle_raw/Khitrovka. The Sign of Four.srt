1
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:02,460
Human.

2
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,711
Here's the truth.

3
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,794
What is a human being?

4
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:09,794
It's not you, it's not me, it's not them. No.

5
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:11,627
The man is you.

6
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:15,211
me, them. the old man, Napoleon, Mohammed, in one.

7
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:18,711
Man this is huge!

8
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:22,836
It's all about beginnings and ends,

9
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,836
It's all in the man,

10
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,837
Everything for the man.

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,170
There is only the human being,

12
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,378
everything else is just a matter of his hands and his brain.

13
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,129
A man!

14
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,045
Chelovec.

15
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:44,879
That's great!

16
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,879
That sounds proud!

17
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,963
That sounds proud.

18
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:05,671
Recess.

19
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,672
So, can we have lunch?

20
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,088
You may.
Thank you.

21
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:17,047
Come on, maestro. Excuse me.

22
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,255
You're doing it again.

23
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:23,255
hiding the rehearsal.

24
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:29,131
Well, I can't get Satine!

25
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:32,881
I'm playing and I realize I'm in the wrong place.

26
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,521
(Footsteps on stage)

27
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:51,465
You need to believe in the sensitivity of the public.

28
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,298
You're a hard man to listen to.

29
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:59,174
The viewer, by your facial expressions and gestures,
what you're trying to tell them.

30
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:02,174
No, you keep playing that detail

31
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,341
And the tone.

32
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:10,841
Keep it upbeat, light, nervous.

33
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,424
I mean with a nerve.

34
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:17,008
Careless and nervous.

35
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:21,383
Light and carefree?

36
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:26,341
Imagine a dark, cold basement.
and for one coin.

37
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:30,758
you may be allowed to sleep under the bunks,
no pillow, no blanket.

38
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,133
And you only have one coin.

39
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,425
I'd like to see you feeling lighter,
after a night like this.

40
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:42,134
Barefoot who? People just like you and me.

41
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:46,509
They are, but they're not!

42
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:50,134
You and I are pampered by welfare,

43
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,134
makes a tragedy out of every problem.

44
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:58,593
Can't you see that Gorky's heroes,
for all their troubles

45
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,135
keep their spirits up,

46
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:05,426
a taste for life.
With all due respect, no.

47
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:09,302
I don't see it, because it doesn't happen in life.

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,343
And you and I have been creating
a theater to bring the truth of life to the people.

49
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,302
What is the truth of life?

50
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:18,760
You still don't know.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,135
And the censors won't let us through
with that truth of yours.

52
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,969
Vladimir Ivanovich, and you

53
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:33,136
are familiar with

54
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:36,136
the master of sharp reportage?

55
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,521
Gilyarovsky, I think.

56
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,095
Familiar.

57
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:45,095
I hear he takes tours of Khitrovka.

58
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:49,262
What, you want to take a tour of these,

59
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:51,970
to the hot spots?

60
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,428
Introduce us.

61
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,512
They say he knows Khitrovka
and its inhabitants better than anyone.

62
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:03,845
Yes, Gorky also lived among the bums, but the fates
of his heroes were too punctilious.

63
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,512
Well, I don't have enough of that for Satin.

64
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:12,221
All right. (chuckles)

65
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,979
(harp playing)

66
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,389
(maitre d') I'm sorry, we're full.

67
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:47,056
And I have an appointment here
a meeting with Nemirovich-Danchenko.

68
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,181
Vladimir Ivanovich.

69
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:04,515
Vladimir Alexeyevich, dear!

70
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,181
Konstantin Sergeyevich!

71
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,140
Please love and pity.

72
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,473
Vladimir Alekseevich
Gilyarovsky, journalist, writer.

73
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,307
Famous researcher of Moscow slums.

74
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:17,349
I'm very glad.

75
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,974
Stanislavski.
Please.

76
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,974
(Gilyarovsky) Thank you.

77
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:24,896
(Maitre d') Menu.

78
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:27,974
I've heard a lot about you.

79
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:30,974
Talented actor, director.

80
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,058
Your theater is already a legend.

81
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:35,141
Thank you.

82
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,141
You're too kind.

83
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,474
Vladimir Ivanovich

84
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:42,475
said you'd taken on Gorky's new play. It's about bums.

85
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,266
That's a great idea.

86
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:48,267
That's why I really want to visit Khitrovka.

87
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,308
Can you take me there?

88
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,934
I can do that.

89
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,559
But I have to warn you right off the bat.

90
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:02,434
This is a very dangerous place.

91
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:03,017
Khitrovka, this is

92
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,851
not just beggar drunks.

93
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:10,392
Fugitive convicts, bandits and murderers hide there.

94
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:13,893
I'll go to Khitrovka myself

95
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,976
without brass knuckles

96
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,976
and I don't walk without a whip.

97
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:22,268
It's a scary place.

98
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,101
Vladimir Alexeyevich,

99
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:29,435
I've been reading your wonderful reports on Khitrovka,
and it seems to me,

100
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:32,435
that someone could write something like that

101
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,643
only a man who truly loves her.

102
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:38,644
Oh, come on. How can you love something like that?

103
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:39,102
No, no, no, no.

104
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:40,644
Konstantin Sergeyevich is right.

105
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:43,644
On Khitrovka, violence reigns, all the vices of the world.
all the vices of the world,

106
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,061
but I don't think you'll find a looser place.

107
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:50,394
It is always up to the individual here to choose how to act.

108
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:52,561
It's mesmerizing, you know!

109
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:53,603
Shall we go, then?

110
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:56,394
Did I scare you? Ha-ha.

111
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,644
I think I'll take my chances.

112
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,520
Gentlemen, are you ready to order?

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,561
Ah, consommÃ© with nocelles,
game crepinettes, and a bottle of Lafite.

114
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:10,562
I'll have a boiled turbot,
with hollandaise sauce and a bottle of Rheinwein.

115
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:12,145
Here, by the way,

116
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:15,187
they serve a gorgeous salpicon on crunchies.

117
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,229
Highly recommended.

118
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:18,937
Yeah, that's great.

119
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:20,687
I'll have some sour soup.

120
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:25,271
And unfortunately, we don't serve soup.

121
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,104
I can offer you soup

122
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:32,104
licked with stuffed pickles.

123
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,271
Well! I think I'll pass!

124
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:38,271
Do you have any veal jelly with sour cream?

125
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:42,355
We'll find it.

126
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,355
And vodka!

127
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:56,439
(beggar's voice) Give me a hand for Christ's sake,

128
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,646
(singing a song to the harmonica)

129
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,689
Give it to me, for God's sake.

130
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,105
Now hold your pockets.

131
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:04,606
They'll be cleaned out in no time!

132
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:07,606
(They can also stab you with a knife.

133
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:12,812
Come and buy!

134
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,396
(dog yelling, barking)

135
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:34,940
This is the way through.

136
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Baranki.

137
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:42,396
Aah!

138
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,732
Taste the pies, buy them!

139
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,024
Watch where you're going!

140
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:52,024
Let's buy! Spread out! Break it up!

141
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:54,941
Take it.

142
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:57,941
Just got here.

143
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,525
I made the deal first! It's my thing!

144
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,608
Check out the product, you won't regret it!

145
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:21,187
(harmonica and violin playing)

146
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:26,192
(Gilyarovsky) Over there.

147
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:30,609
Oh! Oh! Ho-ho!

148
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:34,526
Let's go, let's go.

149
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:49,985
Good wine. Let's buy it!

150
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,568
You won't regret it!

151
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:56,569
Don't be shy! Don't pass by!

152
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:57,694
Well, Konstantin Sergeyevich,

153
00:10:57,694 --> 00:11:00,694
Come on, I'll show you the lodge.

154
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:04,027
Let's go.
(Gilyarovsky) Please.

155
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,611
It's called the Pig House after the name of the owner, Piggy.

156
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:09,861
Even the police don't poke their noses in there.

157
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,277
It's a busy place

158
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,987
Odor.

159
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,570
Here we go,

160
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,570
check it out.

161
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:42,979
(People Talking)

162
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:49,154
Let's go.

163
00:11:54,821 --> 00:12:01,521
Come on.

164
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,229
Many years to Vladimir Alekseevich!

165
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:07,604
Thank you, brother! Thank you!
Many summers.....
(Gilyarovsky) Get outta here!

166
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:15,822
Vodka!
All of you!

167
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:25,322
(Gilyarovsky) After the fire

168
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:29,239
in the 12th year
General Khitrovo, built a remarkable square

169
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:33,614
front gardens, squares, then they added one market,
another.

170
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:37,239
The homeless, the vagrants, the unemployed appeared.

171
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:40,365
This is what we've got.

172
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:42,323
Why aren't they tearing it down?

173
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:45,198
Kulakov, the owner of the biggest lodging house,

174
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,406
he's a friend of the governor general.

175
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:50,407
And you know what that's like.

176
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,896
(horse neighing)

177
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:54,990
Well!

178
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,699
Welcome to the Convict Inn,
a den of outlaws,

179
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:01,699
thieves and fugitives!

180
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:05,812
Please!

181
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:14,562
(music playing)

182
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:40,659
Give me some vodka!

183
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:46,242
All right, clean this up!
half a bottle of vodka and some biscuits.

184
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,396
eggs, for an appetizer.

185
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,729
(Fighting, yelling)

186
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:56,021
(violin playing)

187
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,910
And what do you, you know them all?

188
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,952
Well, not all of them, of course, but I know some of them.

189
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:12,702
And he's over there, look.

190
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:15,285
Tell me, how old is this woman?

191
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:16,869
I'm afraid to guess.

192
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:17,952
She looks old.

193
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,285
And she's only 22 years old.

194
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,327
She's been a prostitute since she was eight years old.

195
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:25,411
Every new baby he has, he sells.

196
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:28,411
to beggars, and immediately spends the money on vodka.

197
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,619
Selling?
Yes! Here, on Khitrovka,

198
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:35,744
Children are the most traded commodity.
They are rented out to beggars from birth.

199
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:39,953
The last week of Lent,

200
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,911
a newborn baby to cry out, walks away ?

201
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,911
a quarter, a three-quarter, a hryvnia.

202
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:49,912
There were times when a child died in the morning, in the arms of beggars.

203
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:52,995
And she's still begging, till nightfall.

204
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:58,704
(song in French)

205
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,746
Who's that?

206
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:21,455
This is Ksenia Andreyevna.

207
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,038
Just princess.

208
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,663
Why princess?

209
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:27,288
Because they're real aristocrats.

210
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,997
How did she end up here?

211
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,288
Her father went bankrupt.

212
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:35,205
She ended up on Khitrovka as a girl.

213
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:37,455
To keep from starving, she learned to steal.

214
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:38,664
That's how it took root.

215
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:42,372
And now she is the Maruha of the most respected thief here, Baldoch.

216
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,081
I'm sorry, what did you say, Maruha?

217
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:49,122
Well, mistress or kept woman, whatever you like.

218
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:51,831
He's at the penitentiary, she's waiting for him,

219
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:54,831
Does she love him?

220
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,331
Who knows?

221
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:04,081
Vladimir Alexeyevich, introduce me.

222
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,082
I'm watching,

223
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:11,082
you can't resist her charms either.

224
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:14,415
Now.

225
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:21,165
Princess!

226
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:21,665
Come here!

227
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:25,832
Come here!

228
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:30,999
Well, hello, Princess.

229
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,249
And good luck to you, too.

230
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:35,666
Have a seat.

231
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,749
How's it going?

232
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:39,166
Still going through your pockets?
Uncle Gilyai,

233
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,708
in front of strangers, don't embarrass me.

234
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,208
Well, when you were embarrassed about your truth.

235
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,875
I want you to meet him.

236
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,917
Konstantin Sergeyevich
Stanislavsky,...... our great director.

237
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,375
Have you heard of him?

238
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,375
No, I haven't.

239
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,292
Why,

240
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,292
wanted to tickle the nerves of vice?

241
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,292
Tickle your nerves.

242
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,959
You could say that,
Uncle Golay,

243
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,876
I'm sick of your

244
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:13,709
the curious.

245
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,709
They come to see us like a menagerie.

246
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:21,335
I'm not going to the menagerie, I need help.

247
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,210
We can help clean out your pockets.

248
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,210
No, really, I mean, I'm like,

249
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,627
I want to know,

250
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,877
what this man is like.

251
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,604
(Music playing)

252
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:52,003
Why?

253
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,586
It's not gonna work out,
what do you two have in common?

254
00:17:56,794 --> 00:17:58,378
That's what this is all about.

255
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,920
In the play, I play a drunk.

256
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,378
And I, by all means,
I need to catch a glimpse of the real him.

257
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Listen to this.

258
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,920
The man pays for everything himself.

259
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:24,254
To faith, to unbelief, to intelligence. To love.

260
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,671
That's why he's free.

261
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,879
Here, what is a human being?

262
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:31,421
A person is not you and me, not them..... No.

263
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:33,671
A person is you, me, them,

264
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:38,296
Napoleon, Mohammed in one.  It's huge!

265
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:42,546
A man is great! That sounds proud!

266
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,421
None of this is true.

267
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,547
What?

268
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:51,838
Well, as you have it, a man is a proud word.

269
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,422
Look at us.

270
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:58,422
Is this where a man can sound proud?

271
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,589
You say it with a sneer, with a chuckle,

272
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:06,464
I might have believed you,

273
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:10,089
( police yelling )

274
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,631
Bless you, Uncle Gilyai!

275
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,548
(Stanislavsky) What's going on?

276
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,298
(Gilyarovsky) Raid.

277
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:18,339
Now, everybody's gonna go up on the roof to wait it out.

278
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,673
But we shouldn't go there.

279
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:25,131
Let me introduce you to someone
I'd like you to meet a very interesting man.

280
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:27,715
Let's go.

281
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:29,298
A real Indian lives here.

282
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,965
Name's Raja.

283
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,673
But I think it's a nickname.

284
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,298
No one knows his real name.

285
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,215
An Indian?
(Gilyarovsky) Yes, he proudly calls himself a Seagh.

286
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:40,632
He has this amazing red turban
which he never takes off.

287
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,424
I think he sleeps in it.

288
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,674
How did he end up in Russia?
Who knows?

289
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:49,632
He doesn't tell us anything about himself.

290
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:51,007
An enigmatic personality.

291
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:55,091
The house from the inside looks like the cave of 40 bandits,
from the tale of 1,000 and One Nights.

292
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:58,424
He and I play chess sometimes.

293
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:01,800
Vladimir Alexeyevich, I think the door is open.

294
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:06,591
Is it open?

295
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,175
That's weird.

296
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,175
But since it's open, let's go in.

297
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:20,396
(footsteps on stairs)

298
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:38,729
(parrot squawking)

299
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:43,396
(disturbing music)

300
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:14,511
What's wrong with him?

301
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:34,137
Dead.

302
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:37,304
We should call the police.

303
00:21:38,354 --> 00:21:40,354
(Laughter and street noise)

304
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:43,595
( horse neighing )

305
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:54,013
(Whistling)
Call Rudnikov!
That Raju has finally been whacked.

306
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,096
Bite your tongue and move your heels,

307
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:03,138
(Rudnikov) Well, show me where to go.

308
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:04,721
I've never been here.

309
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:07,388
(Gilyarovsky) Right here.

310
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:10,388
Maykov, wait for me here. Well, well,

311
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:13,597
And who are you, sir?

312
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:16,014
This is the alleged crime scene.

313
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,930
There should be no outsiders here.

314
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,472
It's with me. Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky,
the great director.

315
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:26,139
Another sightseer, then?

316
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:28,681
For God's sake, don't touch anything with your hands.

317
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,681
Let's go.

318
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,723
Ooh, so Raja passed away,

319
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:37,764
Kingdom of Heaven.

320
00:22:37,764 --> 00:22:40,765
or whatever they're supposed to do.

321
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:44,598
Here Fedot look, here.

322
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:47,348
Vladimir Alexeyevich.

323
00:22:47,348 --> 00:22:50,057
you're the one who pulled me out of pleasant company.

324
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:51,557
What's the rush?

325
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:52,848
Well, a dead body.

326
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,473
if I'd waited a couple or three
hours, I don't think he'd go anywhere.

327
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:58,979
(parrot squawking)

328
00:23:00,307 --> 00:23:02,265
Aha!
(Gilyarovsky) I'm thinking, who could have killed him?

329
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:05,099
No, of course he's been doing
some shady dealings with the tricksters.

330
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:08,516
(Rudnikov) Ahh, the Khitrovites have it simple, finca,

331
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,391
cleaver, axe.

332
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:13,391
And there's the murder weapon,

333
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:16,933
some kind of toothpick. Yes?

334
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:19,683
(Rudnikov) Toothpick?

335
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:22,683
Vladimir Alexeyevich, what is it?

336
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:26,683
(Rudnikov) Don't touch it with your hands.

337
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,517
Well, what, what.

338
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:32,767
Some kind of decoration.

339
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,600
It's not like it's hanging on a nail.

340
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,392
It's stuck right into the wall.

341
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:38,434
(Rudnikov) What's the difference?

342
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:41,684
Raja here, the Oriental antiquities shop.

343
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:45,726
What wonders there are.

344
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:48,017
(Gilyarovsky) And yet,

345
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,309
who could have killed him?

346
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:52,226
I can't assume such a person has,

347
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:55,226
like Raja, had no enemies.

348
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,018
What do you want from me?

349
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,643
No forced entry, so no robbery.

350
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:02,018
There's no sign of a struggle, and what's missing is, or

351
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:02,976
it's not gone,

352
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:05,976
it's a hell of a mess.

353
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:07,476
Lots of goodness.

354
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:09,435
What if it's someone he knows?

355
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:11,268
Maybe he let him in.

356
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:12,768
I mean, who do you know who he knows?

357
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:18,602
And you, do you know many of his acquaintances?

358
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:22,685
Yeah, I guess no one.

359
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:25,186
Uh-huh.
So here I am, nobody but you.

360
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:28,186
You told me yourself, about your chess games.

361
00:24:29,227 --> 00:24:31,144
Maybe you killed him.

362
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:33,811
Because of a lost chess game.

363
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:36,228
(Rudnikov) Well, confess, did you kill?

364
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:38,311
(Gilyarovsky) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Funny!

365
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,228
(Rudnikoff) Yeah, it's funny.

366
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,228
Gentlemen, there's another dart here.

367
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:47,186
Just don't touch it with your hands.

368
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:52,270
Why here?

369
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,645
Why,

370
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:55,645
Why.

371
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,562
The killer missed.

372
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:02,020
Vladimir Alekseyevich, you should stay out of the investigators' business,
I'll do it without you.

373
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:05,437
Fedot Ivanovich, I'll take this and then we'll leave at once?

374
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:08,979
Kha, take it.

375
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:11,354
I don't need him.

376
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:12,854
(Rudnikov) Maykov!

377
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:17,313
All right, I want this place searched,
and then lock it down and don't let anyone in.

378
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,646
Take the bird, or it will die. Do it!

379
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:23,521
(Stanislavsky) Wait,

380
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,146
Check it out,

381
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:26,938
Who's that?

382
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:29,938
Like who. It's the Rajah himself.

383
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:33,438
Yes.... It's been over 10 years,

384
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:37,064
and he hasn't changed at all.

385
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,105
And he sailed on the steamship Petersburg?

386
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:40,814
Who knows.

387
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:43,855
Maybe I did.

388
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:46,314
His life is a mystery.

389
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:49,147
And now, it's going to go away altogether.

390
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:52,148
Let's go.

391
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:02,356
So what, they're gonna find the killer now?

392
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:03,690
I don't think so.

393
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,356
I don't think Raja has any relatives.

394
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:08,773
Soon, his assets will be dispersed into offices,
and he'll be safely forgotten.

395
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:11,607
But it's a fascinating case.

396
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:14,357
First of all, you have to figure it out,

397
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:16,899
what this mysterious toothpick is.

398
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:19,815
And can you die from such a small wound?

399
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:21,607
Uh, hold on.

400
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:23,815
Take a closer look.

401
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,399
The sharp end is a different color.

402
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,399
Maybe it's lubricated with something?

403
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,066
It's possible.

404
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:35,066
I know someone who can help us figure it out.

405
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:04,817
(Gilyarovsky) Professor! He's always being carried around somewhere.

406
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:06,026
Professor!

407
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,776
Where'd he go?

408
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,567
Professor!
(Professor) Gelyai, are you?

409
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,567
Ð¯!

410
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:12,859
You're so out of touch.

411
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:15,859
Come on in. I'll be right down.

412
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,943
Here's the professor, meet the professor.

413
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:29,985
Konstantin Sergeyevich
Stanislavsky, director and actor.

414
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:33,818
Yes, a great actor,
founder of the Moscow Art Theater.

415
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:37,194
And this is Agafon Spiridonovich Trassenmaer.

416
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:41,027
Doctor.
You can just call me Professor.

417
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,736
Look at him, he's beautiful!

418
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,111
Fresh.

419
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:47,902
It's only three hours,

420
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:50,736
Like a stabbing.

421
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,611
Professor, aren't you afraid they'll be looking for him?

422
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:57,444
WELL. by the time they realize
there'll be nothing left of him.

423
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,320
(Beggar) Professor, five kopecks are missing.

424
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:02,945
Come back in two days.

425
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:04,986
Not a dime now.

426
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:07,528
(beggar) Scrooge.

427
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,153
(Professor) Right! Nutis.
(Stanislavsky) What are you doing?

428
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,570
(professor) What does a director do?

429
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,778
Rehearsing.

430
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,779
And I'm a surgeon. I have to rehearse, too.

431
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:21,570
If there's anything that needs to be cut, feel free to ask.

432
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,612
(Gilyarovsky) Professor,
we've brought you something very interesting.

433
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:28,154
I bet you can't surprise me with anything right now.

434
00:28:28,446 --> 00:28:36,696
(Gilyarovsky) Oh!
(Professor) Looks like I've lost.

435
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:41,863
(Gilyarovsky) Ah!
(Professor) Ask where you got it from, I guess there's no point.

436
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,488
Do you think you could kill a man with that?

437
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,780
Depends on what the stuff is impregnated with.

438
00:28:56,864 --> 00:28:59,864
(Gilyarovsky) And?
I need time.

439
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,322
(Gilyarovsky) A day...
Two, three,

440
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:07,197
But no guarantees.
(Gilyarovsky) Okay, I'll come back in two days.

441
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:10,114
So long.

442
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:13,114
Let's go, Konstantin Sergeyevich!

443
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,781
(Nemirovich-Danchenko) The stoker is drunk again.

444
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:21,490
(Stanislavsky) So hire someone else.

445
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,240
(Nemirovich-Danchenko) The other will have to pay, twice as much.

446
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:28,198
Don't forget, if we're

447
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:31,532
we want to keep the lead actors this season,

448
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,948
they need to raise their salaries, and the prices
and everything's going up.

449
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,407
Only on firewood will we spend.....

450
00:29:40,115 --> 00:29:42,490
3 000 â½.

451
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,449
That being said, don't forget the royalties to the authors.

452
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:48,449
I've already paid the advance to Gorky.

453
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:51,449
Take my director's fee.

454
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,741
And for you in Three Sisters,

455
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:56,658
I want gooseberry jam on stage.

456
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:59,658
Not only is it
you can't find it anywhere else, it costs a fortune,

457
00:29:59,783 --> 00:30:02,408
a fortune.

458
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:05,408
Vladimir Ivanovich, but you're a director.

459
00:30:06,158 --> 00:30:09,367
And Chekhov said that gooseberries,
was Vershinin's favorite berry.

460
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:14,200
No one in the audience can see
what kind of jam Vershinin is eating on stage.

461
00:30:14,992 --> 00:30:17,992
I can see that.

462
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:21,492
And, by the way, that watchman of yours is new,

463
00:30:21,492 --> 00:30:23,992
what's his name?
Nemirovich-Danchenko) Kolotushkin.

464
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:26,909
He's a whisperer.

465
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:27,909
So what?

466
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,617
How and what?

467
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:32,368
How can a man like that even serve in the theater?

468
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:33,868
It's a theater!

469
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:39,451
Konstantin Sergeyevich,
our censors won't let "At the Bottom" through.

470
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:42,118
And you me about Kolotushkin!

471
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,951
(quiet music) Here, listen to what they say.

472
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:52,118
There is absolutely no plot in the play.

473
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:55,702
All that is present is a lot of random running around.

474
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,910
Or here's another thing, unchanged,

475
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:05,077
a play can't be not only produced,
but simply published.

476
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:09,452
It's unclear,

477
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,827
whether Gorky would even be allowed to return to Moscow.

478
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:16,411
I, of course, wrote police department, but--
(Stanislavsky) I beg your pardon,
(Nemirovich-Danchenko) Where are you going?

479
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:19,161
We're rehearsing.

480
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:20,661
Start without me.

481
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,578
All the mise-en-scÃ¨ne I've mapped out.

482
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:26,578
Konstantin Sergeyevich!

483
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:30,787
(man) Darling, do you have any white roses?

484
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:35,703
(florist) Unfortunately, no.
(wife) Darling, but who gives white roses on a birthday?

485
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,954
(man) I know what my sister likes.

486
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:40,954
(wife) Yeah, you know, but I always pick the gift.

487
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:46,412
Girls like brighter colors.

488
00:31:49,204 --> 00:31:51,621
The princess speaks French.

489
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:54,663
Anna Shafran Manifesto of Mademoiselle.

490
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,496
(wife) At least take the red one!

491
00:31:58,538 --> 00:31:58,996
(man) Red?

492
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:01,663
It is in the language of flowers, the color of passion.

493
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:04,496
Maybe,
white? The color of innocence and purity.

494
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:07,288
Ksenia Andreyevna!
Let me in, I don't know you,

495
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,330
Bring it back,

496
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,330
or I'll call a policeman.

497
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,479
(cabbie) Hey! Look out!

498
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:17,872
(man) Let's have the red ones.

499
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:20,872
You're welcome.

500
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:26,789
(wife) Here, I think it's a little fresher.

501
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:28,622
(man) Yes, darling, it's all for you.

502
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:30,872
(flower girl) You have good taste! Nice flowers!

503
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:33,873
The princess speaks French.

504
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,331
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,664
(man) What? Where?

506
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:41,665
My God, my God, how can it be?
(wife) Andrei Ivanovich, you always lose everything!

507
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:00,665
Didn't you recognize me?

508
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:02,707
I'm Konstantin Stanislavsky, director.

509
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:08,624
Yesterday we were introduced by Gilyarovsky.
(Princess) By your grace, I'm left without a living today.

510
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:11,624
Alas, I could not do otherwise.

511
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:15,833
Let me take you out for coffee.
If I'm going to coffee,

512
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,416
definitely not with you.

513
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:21,166
Let me make it up to you.

514
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,166
How much do you need?

515
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,291
Are you just going to give the money to a thief
to a thief?

516
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,833
Not for nothing, .... for talking,

517
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,833
All right. Uh-huh.

518
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,209
But I'm still not having coffee with you.

519
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:40,125
(voice-over) Stop at Khitrovsky Lane!

520
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,750
You're weird.

521
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,376
Who could possibly be interested, a play about bums?

522
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:46,292
Aren't bums people?

523
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:49,167
The exes, the disgraced, the lost.

524
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,501
Is that what people are going to be called?

525
00:33:57,126 --> 00:34:00,126
It's, uh, more out of fear.

526
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,210
After all, it is easier to shut out than to try to understand.

527
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:08,668
Understand what?
Why people, between a normal life
and the slums, they choose the slums.

528
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:13,752
You, you know how to dress nicely.
That's not my dress.
It doesn't matter.

529
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:17,419
You know how to behave socially,
You speak good French.

530
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:20,002
Why are you still on Khitrovka?

531
00:34:20,002 --> 00:34:22,627
You have everything you need to live a private life.

532
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,627
I was brought up in Khitrovka.

533
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:30,794
My daddy, in a fit of white fever,

534
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:34,128
hit my mom in the head with a stool.

535
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:38,503
Then he died in Siberia, on a penal servitude.

536
00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:41,420
And I was only four years old at the time.

537
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Who needed me?

538
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:47,753
For the first couple years, I lived with an old beggar.

539
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,212
And stealing for her at the market,
to pay for a night's lodging.

540
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:55,212
And then this woman died.

541
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:58,212
I've been taken in by cats!

542
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,629
Cats?
Pimps,

543
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:02,295
according to you.

544
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:05,796
Because everything you just told me is not true.

545
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:14,504
Yeah, it's not true.

546
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:17,546
Don't take me any further.

547
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:20,546
Why?

548
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:28,255
Strangers are not welcome on Khitrovka!

549
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:31,547
And Uncle Gilyai is not with you now.

550
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,062
(cabbie) Look out!

551
00:35:57,131 --> 00:36:00,131
Well, here you are!
And it's good to see you.

552
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,340
Your share.

553
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,923
There's a kha for you,

554
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:12,215
Rudnikov is waiting.

555
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:13,632
It's a great honor.

556
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,215
What does he want?

557
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,549
Why do I know?

558
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:20,007
But I wouldn't go.

559
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:23,007
Well, I have no sins.

560
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:32,466
(innkeeper murmurs)

561
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:35,466
(Voice) ...don't know anything.

562
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:39,133
Remembering Pharaoh following you....

563
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:42,258
(laughter)

564
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:48,592
Hello, Fedot Ivanovich!

565
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:50,383
Are you waiting for me?

566
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:53,383
You.

567
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:59,467
To what do I owe?

568
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,467
I was just wondering,

569
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:04,259
on Baldoch, not so much.

570
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:07,259
miss me?

571
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:09,176
Well, what's there to miss?

572
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:12,176
I'm a free bird.

573
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:15,218
Aah! We know how free-spirited you are.

574
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:21,135
Tell me,

575
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:21,968
and isn't that you,

576
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:24,218
he always had on his packages?

577
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:25,551
No catch, no thief.

578
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:28,552
But, uh. that's if you're not caught.

579
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:33,635
That's it, sweetheart!

580
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,302
Well, uh. your handkerchief?

581
00:37:47,427 --> 00:37:50,427
Well, mine.

582
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:55,178
Well, you're keeping your mouth shut, that's good.

583
00:37:57,969 --> 00:37:58,719
They found it at Raja's.

584
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:02,178
You don't remember when you dropped it?

585
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:05,178
I wasn't at Raja's.

586
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:06,845
You didn't?

587
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:09,845
It wasn't.

588
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:16,304
You'll be in a cell for a while.

589
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,095
You'll remember something.  Yes?

590
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:39,896
Here you go.

591
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,721
(Gilyarovsky) Rudnikov at his place?
(policeman) At himself.

592
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:51,729
(high-pitched noise)

593
00:38:58,014 --> 00:39:00,847
I told you not to come to my place

594
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:03,847
to Khitrovka! Go!

595
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:06,222
Ð! Vladimir Alexeyevich!

596
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:08,556
What are you doing here?
Fedot Ivanovich?

597
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:09,597
I heard that you're the Princess

598
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,764
arrested for the murder of Raja.

599
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:16,056
(Rudnikov) Moscow is quickly filled with rumors.

600
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:19,562
Please.

601
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:26,431
Well, Vladimir Alexeyevich,

602
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:29,890
you're still in love with being a detective, aren't you?

603
00:39:31,057 --> 00:39:34,015
What makes you think the murderer is the princess?

604
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:38,015
Here... That's what makes professionals different,

605
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:42,932
from amateurs. Perseverance and meticulousness.

606
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:46,307
Now you're gone, and my boys are along

607
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:50,932
and searched Raji's house and found it there,

608
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:54,641
this is her handkerchief.

609
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:57,641
What makes you think the handkerchief is hers?

610
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:01,558
The whole of Khitrovka
knows that Baldoch gave his princess

611
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:05,141
five dozen silk handkerchiefs, monogrammed.

612
00:40:07,516 --> 00:40:11,225
And she dropped one of them at Raja's place.

613
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:15,225
(Stanislavsky) But that's not enough to prove guilt.

614
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:18,225
No, it's not enough.

615
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,600
But it's enough to get her
for her to plead guilty voluntarily.

616
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:23,725
Did she admit it?

617
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,434
No, not yet.

618
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:30,309
Stubborn girl.

619
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:31,684
It's okay, he'll confess.

620
00:40:31,684 --> 00:40:34,309
Where's she gonna go?

621
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:38,601
Fedot Ivanovich, let me talk to her, huh?
It doesn't seem to fit.

622
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,393
Princess. Darts.

623
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:43,393
Why would she kill Raju?

624
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:46,351
Vladimir Alexeyevich,

625
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:49,352
here you are on Khitrovka, not the first year.

626
00:40:49,852 --> 00:40:52,268
And you should know that there are crimes

627
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:55,268
for no reason at all, they do it all the time.

628
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:57,185
I'm not gonna let you talk.

629
00:40:57,185 --> 00:40:58,727
You'll only embarrass her.

630
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:01,727
Still, I don't believe
that Ksenia Andreyevna could have killed.

631
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,769
She and I met casually the other day, had a chat.

632
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:06,852
She turned out to be a very deep person.

633
00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:09,019
Konstantin Sergeyevich, you're an idealist!

634
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:11,519
I've seen it on Khitrovka.

635
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,519
And then the princess, she's a thief, a bandit's mistress.

636
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:18,436
Fedot Ivanovich is right, for a murder on Khitrovka,
you don't need a motive.

637
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,520
A cabbie!

638
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,520
I've seen how your Fedot Ivanovich works.

639
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:26,978
Well, our tour is over.

640
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:28,687
I did my best.

641
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,895
I think that's enough to work on the play.

642
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:31,437
Thank you.

643
00:41:33,187 --> 00:41:34,603
With me?
No.

644
00:41:34,603 --> 00:41:37,270
I think I'll take a walk.

645
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,270
Have a nice stay.

646
00:41:40,937 --> 00:41:44,104
(Stanislavsky) If you're near the theater, drop by.
(Gilyarovsky) By all means.

647
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:48,187
Stoleshnikov.
(cabbie) Well!

648
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:08,812
(street noise)

649
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,562
(bells ringing)

650
00:43:57,354 --> 00:43:59,354
(disturbing music)

651
00:44:17,444 --> 00:44:20,235
Well, well, well.

652
00:44:20,235 --> 00:44:23,110
The esteemed director breaks into the seat.

653
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:26,652
of committing a crime without police authorization.

654
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:29,111
That's a great headline for the papers!

655
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:31,986
It's just beautiful!

656
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:33,361
Ha-ha! What are you doing here?

657
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:36,361
Well, apparently the same as you.

658
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:39,611
I just came by to see
see if I could find anything interesting.

659
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:43,070
So how did you get in?

660
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,195
Just like you.

661
00:44:45,195 --> 00:44:48,028
Through an open window.

662
00:44:48,028 --> 00:44:48,737
It has to be,

663
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:51,737
the police forgot to lock up.

664
00:44:53,278 --> 00:44:54,187
Do you hear that?

665
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:55,771
The door opened,

666
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:57,570
(Door creaks)
The door opened,

667
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:57,771
Someone's in here!
(Door creaks)

668
00:44:57,771 --> 00:44:59,612
Someone's in here!

669
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:01,945
Maybe the police?

670
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:03,820
I don't think so.

671
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,821
And who?

672
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:10,362
What?

673
00:45:34,187 --> 00:45:34,229
Quiet!

674
00:45:35,238 --> 00:45:37,655
Who are you gentlemen?

675
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:39,322
Who the hell are you?

676
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,572
I am the nephew of the owner of this house.

677
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,239
How do you prove it?

678
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:45,364
I have a picture in my purse.

679
00:45:45,364 --> 00:45:48,364
I'll let you go now, but no tricks.

680
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:09,615
What's your name?
Sanji.

681
00:46:10,323 --> 00:46:11,198
What about you?

682
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,490
Stanislavsky, director.

683
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,365
Gilyarovsky.

684
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:19,282
Reporter.

685
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:22,615
Vladimir Alexeyevich?
Well.
(nephew) I've heard.

686
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:25,866
That's your uncle playing chess with you.

687
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,532
Well, where is he?

688
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:31,532
You probably don't know.

689
00:46:31,824 --> 00:46:34,824
Your uncle was murdered.

690
00:46:35,283 --> 00:46:39,312
We offer our sincere condolences.

691
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:58,117
Aah! Yeah! That's a serious blow to me.

692
00:46:58,117 --> 00:47:01,117
My uncle brought me back as a boy from India.

693
00:47:01,325 --> 00:47:03,284
Gave education.

694
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:06,284
How did he die?

695
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,951
In his neck, there was a dart sticking out.

696
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:12,951
Probably poisoned.

697
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:16,159
That's weird.
What do you think,

698
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:18,701
why would your uncle be killed?

699
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:19,576
I don't know.

700
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:22,868
No, of course he was doing
in some not-so-legal endeavors.

701
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,910
And Khitrovka is full of dangerous people.

702
00:47:26,118 --> 00:47:27,826
And he's not that easy to kill.

703
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:30,827
He always had Chakra on him.

704
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:34,452
Chakra? What's that?
An ancient Indian throwing weapon.

705
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:38,202
Metal ring, with sharpened edges.

706
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:46,744
Is that her?

707
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:51,661
Yeah, that's her.

708
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,494
So there was a fight.

709
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:56,869
Someone comes to Raja's house at night.

710
00:47:56,869 --> 00:47:58,994
He's letting him in.

711
00:47:58,994 --> 00:48:01,828
The conversation turns into an argument. Raja

712
00:48:05,036 --> 00:48:07,786
throws chakra,

713
00:48:07,786 --> 00:48:10,787
but misses.

714
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:16,079
Do you know this house well?

715
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,704
Can you tell if there's anything missing?

716
00:48:21,037 --> 00:48:24,037
Well, uh. it's gonna take me a while,

717
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,162
even though there's a stash.

718
00:48:26,162 --> 00:48:29,162
My uncle showed it to me a few years ago.

719
00:48:29,662 --> 00:48:31,454
He asked me to get something out of him,

720
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:34,454
if anything happens to him.

721
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,038
We can take a look.

722
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:48,997
She's gone.

723
00:48:48,997 --> 00:48:49,913
What's not?

724
00:48:49,913 --> 00:48:51,705
Caskets.

725
00:48:51,705 --> 00:48:54,163
There must be something very valuable in it.

726
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:57,247
My uncle's a big fan of rarities,
started collecting them,

727
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,330
when....(dart whistle)

728
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:06,372
What's wrong with him?

729
00:49:06,372 --> 00:49:07,914
Murdered!

730
00:49:07,914 --> 00:49:10,706
Ooh! Get back, get back!

731
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:15,289
Well, well, well. Stop! Konstantin Sergeyevich, stay here.

732
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:16,873
I'll be right back.

733
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:19,873
No, I'm in.

734
00:49:22,979 --> 00:49:24,979
(disturbing music)

735
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:51,979
(children screaming)

736
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:58,124
He's gone. Uh-huh!

737
00:49:58,499 --> 00:49:59,749
Take a look.

738
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:02,083
Ð? That's weird.

739
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,583
The foot feels like it's bifurcating.

740
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,083
I've never seen anything like this before.

741
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:08,208
It's really weird. Everything
about this case,

742
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:11,208
it's all very strange.

743
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,042
Well, we should call Rudnikov.

744
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,167
He's gonna be so happy.

745
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:21,459
The princess is in a cell,
which means we have to look for the real killer. Ð!

746
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:24,667
(children's voices)

747
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:27,667
Let's go.

748
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:31,521
(Dart whistles)

749
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:39,043
What are you doing, Professor,
you want to kill the last person

750
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:41,876
who has bright feelings for you?

751
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:44,168
I didn't put poison on them.

752
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:47,168
The worst you could do was get your eye taken out.

753
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,418
Which is fine, of course.

754
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:52,418
Come on in, let's shoot.

755
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,835
I think they use this thing, like that.

756
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:03,294
I conducted a series of experiments
in which my favorite rat died.

757
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,044
But I still have the other one.

758
00:51:06,044 --> 00:51:08,252
Would you like to see the effects of poison on a rat?

759
00:51:08,252 --> 00:51:09,211
You don't have to.

760
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:10,711
We've seen that recently.

761
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:13,211
Yes? That's a shame.

762
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:16,003
Professor, what kind of poison is this?

763
00:51:16,003 --> 00:51:20,378
You have no idea how many plants there are
that you can make

764
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,795
amazing poisons!

765
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:25,795
The choice depends on
how you want to kill your victim.

766
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,795
Instantly or make her suffer.

767
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:31,795
Professor, get to the point,

768
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:36,545
The poison was manufactured

769
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:39,545
from the seeds of the rare Abrus precatorius plant.

770
00:51:39,837 --> 00:51:42,254
A rosary man.

771
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:46,629
In fact, to kill a person with this poison,
it doesn't even need to enter the bloodstream.

772
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:49,212
Just apply to the skin and it's done.

773
00:51:50,546 --> 00:51:51,171
The Breadwinner

774
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:54,629
grows in hot countries with high levels of humidity.
humidity levels.

775
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:57,629
Southeast Asia, Burma, India.

776
00:51:57,629 --> 00:52:01,713
But then I have no idea
how he could have gotten to Russia, I have no idea.

777
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,088
Raja from India,

778
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:07,088
this dart, it's a salute to his past.

779
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:10,672
Well, Professor, brilliant!

780
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:14,338
You're as good as ever!
(Professor) I haven't said anything new.

781
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:17,089
But thank you, it's nice.

782
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:20,089
Maybe we should
see how the poison works on the second rat.

783
00:52:21,297 --> 00:52:22,547
Some other time.

784
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:25,547
We should probably get going. See you later.

785
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:28,589
Okay, have a good one.

786
00:52:36,562 --> 00:52:38,562
(street noise)

787
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:49,646
(prostitutes laughing) Give me a cigarette!

788
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:21,550
Aren't you the barman?

789
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:24,341
I'm the barmaid. But I can see that,

790
00:53:24,341 --> 00:53:26,800
you're not here to drink vodka.

791
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Behind the dirty rags, you can't hide your origins.

792
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:33,133
Why are you here, gentlemen?

793
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:36,884
Satan needs to be talked to.

794
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:39,550
I don't know that one.

795
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,842
And you say Golay is here.

796
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,925
He knows.

797
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:44,801
All right. Uh-huh.

798
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:47,801
Escort your guests to the underworld.

799
00:53:58,229 --> 00:54:00,229
(fighting noises)

800
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:13,979
(dogs barking)

801
00:54:24,437 --> 00:54:26,437
(woman screaming)

802
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:30,638
A lot of knowledge,

803
00:55:30,972 --> 00:55:37,354
many sorrows.

804
00:55:55,396 --> 00:55:57,396
(disturbing music)

805
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:23,349
Golay, do I need to remind you what happens with

806
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,937
by those who come here uninvited?

807
00:56:26,391 --> 00:56:29,349
Probably the same thing that's happening to those

808
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:32,349
who are in no hurry to pay back their debts.

809
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:36,766
Who's that?

810
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:40,350
Our great director, Stanislavski.

811
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,850
You ever heard of it?

812
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,850
No, I haven't.

813
00:56:46,725 --> 00:56:48,808
That the director,

814
00:56:48,808 --> 00:56:51,808
has brought you here, huh?

815
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:03,434
You have three minutes.

816
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:07,184
I wanted to know,

817
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:09,517
if it's surfaced on Khitrovka lately,

818
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:12,518
of some particularly valuable item.

819
00:57:12,893 --> 00:57:15,226
But you know the rules.

820
00:57:15,226 --> 00:57:17,101
I don't give up mine.

821
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,726
You know I don't give yours up either.

822
00:57:19,726 --> 00:57:22,726
I'd like to have a word with the man

823
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:25,143
A very valuable thing, you say?

824
00:57:25,143 --> 00:57:27,310
Yes, very much so.

825
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,727
Then not us.

826
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:31,518
We only work with the small stuff.

827
00:57:31,518 --> 00:57:34,518
If anything, I'm serious, is this to Testov or Brown?

828
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,560
Brown's on the water right now.
And Testov?

829
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:42,769
And Testov doesn't deal with Khitrov's.

830
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,769
Only with Baldoch.

831
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:49,769
And only because he's a virtuoso.

832
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:54,936
Baltoch is on penal servitude.

833
00:57:56,019 --> 00:57:57,186
I heard he escaped,

834
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:01,186
(Gilyarovsky) Did you hear or did you run away?

835
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,311
I heard.

836
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:06,311
All right! Time!

837
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:10,645
Well, we'll go.

838
00:58:12,062 --> 00:58:15,062
It was a pleasure to meet you, have a nice day.

839
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:38,438
Did you have a good time?

840
00:58:38,438 --> 00:58:41,438
Oh, that's great.

841
00:58:55,187 --> 00:58:57,187
(click)

842
00:59:04,896 --> 00:59:06,896
(screams fighting)

843
00:59:14,564 --> 00:59:16,231
Ha!...That was convincing.

844
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:18,689
Vladimir Alekseyevich.
(Gilyarovsky) Okay.

845
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:20,606
We gotta get outta here.

846
00:59:20,606 --> 00:59:23,606
Please. Hoo!

847
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:29,148
Ahaa!

848
00:59:32,396 --> 00:59:34,396
(dogs barking)

849
00:59:36,729 --> 00:59:38,729
Hoo!

850
00:59:41,065 --> 00:59:42,774
What do you think,

851
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:44,941
Has Boltoch really escaped from hard labor?

852
00:59:44,941 --> 00:59:48,816
Well, if Satan said he heard it,
then he escaped.

853
00:59:48,816 --> 00:59:51,816
And where he could be hiding,
is here, on Khitrovka.

854
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:54,354
(Whistling)

855
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:57,858
Who's Testov?

856
00:59:57,858 --> 00:59:59,108
Tests?

857
00:59:59,108 --> 01:00:02,316
Nicanor Ivanovich, a well-known antiquarian in Moscow.

858
01:00:03,025 --> 01:00:06,025
Which means he's not shy about buying stolen goods.

859
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:10,567
Then we must go to Nicanor Ivanovich.

860
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:28,859
(street noise)

861
01:00:37,812 --> 01:00:38,693
Thank you

862
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:49,735
Vladimir Alexeyevich, see Bacchus,

863
01:00:49,735 --> 01:00:50,943
of Michelangelo's work.

864
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:52,485
There must be a copy.

865
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:54,735
(Testov) Yes yes, of course, it's a copy.

866
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:58,110
Dear Konstantin Sergeyevich, 18th century.

867
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:02,110
I bought it in Florence from Count Strozzi.

868
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,402
Oh, I'm so glad!

869
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:06,152
I couldn't dream.

870
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:07,777
Saw "Three Sisters," your Vershinin,

871
01:01:07,777 --> 01:01:09,486
this is something amazing!

872
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:11,902
So much restraint, so much nobility.
(Thank you.

873
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:15,486
So, Vladimir Alexeyevich, what brings you here?

874
01:01:15,486 --> 01:01:18,486
You're not here to write a crime story, are you?

875
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:21,361
No, not a chronicle.

876
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:24,695
I just came by to ask if you've ever had

877
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:27,861
for days. some

878
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,945
an interesting offer? Ð?

879
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:31,945
Uh, Vladimir Alexeyevich!

880
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:34,945
Nikanor Ivanovich?
You've got the nose of a dog!

881
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,820
It was.

882
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,112
A ragamuffin came in,

883
01:01:40,112 --> 01:01:42,820
brought a box of extraordinary beauty.

884
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,237
Where'd you get it?

885
01:01:43,237 --> 01:01:46,237
Of course he did.
It's in the box,

886
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:48,404
It took my breath away.

887
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,404
The Spark of the East herself!

888
01:01:51,529 --> 01:01:52,238
Spark of the East,

889
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:55,238
allow this......
The most unique necklace

890
01:01:55,488 --> 01:01:58,321
An emerald of rare magnitude.

891
01:01:58,321 --> 01:02:00,863
With a gold setting studded with diamonds.

892
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:04,446
And guess what, gentlemen,
I see this necklace in much the same way,

893
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:07,821
as you are now, in the hands of some ragamuffin!
And you bought it?

894
01:02:08,655 --> 01:02:10,905
No. Real antique dealers

895
01:02:10,905 --> 01:02:13,905
there's a rule,
we never buy stolen goods.

896
01:02:13,905 --> 01:02:16,530
Must have turned the ragamuffin in to the police?

897
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,905
No, come on. I mean, they're clients.

898
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:20,197
Clients are sacred to us.

899
01:02:20,197 --> 01:02:23,030
I just, I just walked him out.

900
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:25,989
And gentlemen, you know what.

901
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:27,822
just yesterday

902
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:30,781
an investigator came to see me,

903
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:31,822
with that accent.

904
01:02:31,822 --> 01:02:33,864
English, I guess.

905
01:02:33,864 --> 01:02:36,864
The most beautiful cane he had, the head of it.

906
01:02:37,031 --> 01:02:41,781
skillfully carved in the shape of a winged beast,
with the body of a man and the head of a bird.

907
01:02:41,823 --> 01:02:43,906
And what's the investigator?

908
01:02:43,906 --> 01:02:48,990
And the investigator told me about the theft,
but he wouldn't tell me what was stolen.

909
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:51,990
But I knew right away
that this was about the Spark of the East.

910
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,948
So I told him the whole story.

911
01:02:54,948 --> 01:02:59,907
Really, I think for an investigator,
his suit was too expensive.

912
01:03:00,157 --> 01:03:01,407
And that cane!

913
01:03:01,407 --> 01:03:04,032
What a curious story?

914
01:03:04,032 --> 01:03:05,366
Exactly, exactly.

915
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:09,199
I think it would make.... a novella or a good play.

916
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:11,407
How fortunate we're here.

917
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:13,699
You know,

918
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:14,991
which, I'm sorry,

919
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,991
Konstantin Sergeyevich wanted to invite you to the theater.

920
01:03:18,158 --> 01:03:21,158
Me?
Yes, yes, with my wife.

921
01:03:21,491 --> 01:03:22,575
We have an opening night coming up.

922
01:03:22,575 --> 01:03:24,408
We're doing a play by Gorky.

923
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:27,366
Well, I'm glad. We'll be there, of course, we will.

924
01:03:27,366 --> 01:03:29,742
I'd love to.
All right. I guess we should get going.

925
01:03:31,033 --> 01:03:34,033
Have a nice day.

926
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:37,867
Good to meet you, gentlemen,

927
01:03:55,562 --> 01:03:57,562
(cane tapping)

928
01:04:01,826 --> 01:04:04,660
Are you here yet?

929
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,326
I wasn't expecting you for another hour.

930
01:04:07,326 --> 01:04:10,327
The back door was open.

931
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,160
How long have you been here?

932
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,160
Enough to hear everything you've said.

933
01:04:17,577 --> 01:04:20,077
Who are these gentlemen?

934
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:21,369
Don't you know that?

935
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:23,285
These are our celebrities.

936
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:25,827
Directed by Stanislavsky, written by Nemirovsky.

937
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:28,827
You should definitely go see
to some Stanislavski production.

938
01:04:29,327 --> 01:04:32,286
What he does on stage is something incredible.

939
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,619
Why did you tell on me?

940
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:38,286
Yeah, I'm just giving them a plot for a story.
or maybe a play.

941
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:42,370
Don't worry,
they won't take this story seriously.

942
01:04:43,536 --> 01:04:45,745
Creative people.

943
01:04:45,745 --> 01:04:47,578
And in our business,

944
01:04:47,578 --> 01:04:49,787
connections are always important.

945
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:51,828
And then,

946
01:04:51,828 --> 01:04:54,578
at this address at four o'clock

947
01:04:54,578 --> 01:04:57,579
you'll be waiting for Boldoh at noon.

948
01:05:02,954 --> 01:05:05,954
You definitely saw the necklace.

949
01:05:05,954 --> 01:05:08,412
How are you now?

950
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:11,287
That's weird, that box has a secret.

951
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:14,288
And there are only two people who know this secret.

952
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:15,538
One of them is dead.

953
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:17,496
The second, yours truly.

954
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:20,788
The thing is, Baldoh

955
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:23,580
some kind of hacking genius.

956
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:26,580
There's nothing closed that he can't open.

957
01:05:29,038 --> 01:05:31,455
Anything else?

958
01:05:31,455 --> 01:05:33,497
Circumstances have changed.

959
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:36,497
I'll bring you the necklace tonight.

960
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:39,789
You'll pay me the full amount at once.

961
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:42,830
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Sweetest. No, no, no.

962
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:45,831
I'm afraid that's out of the question.

963
01:05:46,081 --> 01:05:48,747
You have no reason to distrust me.

964
01:05:48,747 --> 01:05:51,747
Then how about me, on your account.

965
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:56,081
Uh, well, uh,
let's just leave it at that. Today.

966
01:05:56,414 --> 01:05:59,998
You bring me the goods,
and I'll send you the money tomorrow.

967
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,623
Otherwise, I wish you good luck finding a new buyer.

968
01:06:05,665 --> 01:06:07,206
All right. Uh-huh.

969
01:06:07,206 --> 01:06:10,207
The arrangements remain in place.

970
01:06:11,165 --> 01:06:12,790
Think about it.

971
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,790
Where am I going to get away from you?

972
01:06:15,873 --> 01:06:18,874
It's true!

973
01:06:19,457 --> 01:06:22,457
Still, you shouldn't have said that much about me.

974
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:35,166
Shit! English!

975
01:06:47,812 --> 01:06:49,812
(disturbing music)

976
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,854
(Dart whistles)

977
01:07:53,187 --> 01:07:55,104
(quiet music)

978
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:57,253
Konstantin Sergeyevich,

979
01:07:57,253 --> 01:08:00,336
Messrs. Chekhov and Nemirovich-Danchenko are waiting for you.

980
01:08:00,336 --> 01:08:03,336
Please.

981
01:08:04,586 --> 01:08:07,461
Ð! Ohh!

982
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:09,212
Anton Pavlovich, how nice to see you!

983
01:08:09,212 --> 01:08:11,378
Mutual, mutual, please.

984
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:12,712
Thank you.

985
01:08:12,712 --> 01:08:15,712
You're late, Konstantin Sergeyevich, we've already had lunch.

986
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,545
I'm not having lunch.
Suit yourself.
Ð! Ooh! Look at that!

987
01:08:20,795 --> 01:08:21,087
Oh, my God.

988
01:08:21,087 --> 01:08:22,962
that this is a greeting from the underworld.

989
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:25,962
It's a breakthrough in the restaurant business and a triumph of chemistry,

990
01:08:26,587 --> 01:08:30,129
to make ice cream with liquid nitrogen.

991
01:08:30,462 --> 01:08:32,171
How does it feel?

992
01:08:32,171 --> 01:08:33,296
It's very curious.

993
01:08:33,296 --> 01:08:36,046
Well, I really want to try this.

994
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,379
You guys have no peace of mind.

995
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:41,380
Anton Pavlovich,
we have Stanislavsky as a detective.

996
01:08:41,463 --> 01:08:42,088
Oh, come on!

997
01:08:42,088 --> 01:08:45,088
Yeah, he and Gilyarovsky have been going at it nonstop.

998
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:48,130
from the slums of Khitrov.
With Golay?

999
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:52,380
You can do it with Golay, it's okay with Golay.

1000
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,547
By the way, I had him on vacation in Melikhovo last summer.

1001
01:08:55,547 --> 01:08:59,714
So he walked 80 miles in a day, killed a bear,

1002
01:09:00,922 --> 01:09:02,630
a fox and a lot of hares.

1003
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:05,714
The thing is, we're involved in a very mysterious story.
a very mysterious story.

1004
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:09,839
Konstantin Sergeyevich,
is a thrill-seeker.

1005
01:09:11,172 --> 01:09:14,798
Why me, too. About 10 years ago.

1006
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,881
traveled from Siberia to Sakhalin,
and back by steamboat

1007
01:09:18,881 --> 01:09:21,881
through China, Burma and India.

1008
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,340
It's been a wonderful journey.

1009
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:29,798
Lots of, as you say, thrills.
Have you sailed past India?

1010
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:32,007
That's right.

1011
01:09:32,007 --> 01:09:35,007
Then maybe you've heard of this strange weapon,

1012
01:09:35,382 --> 01:09:38,382
little darts soaked in poison?

1013
01:09:38,882 --> 01:09:40,465
They shoot them out of tubes like this.

1014
01:09:43,174 --> 01:09:46,174
You won't believe it, but I heard it.

1015
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,132
Anton Pavlovich, don't keep me in suspense.

1016
01:09:48,132 --> 01:09:50,549
Sailing through the Indian Ocean,

1017
01:09:50,549 --> 01:09:54,591
We made a stop off the Andaman Islands
to pick up an Indian,

1018
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:58,174
Sigha, who had just finished his service

1019
01:09:58,508 --> 01:10:02,800
in a British penal colony. It's a horrible place,
he said it was.

1020
01:10:03,216 --> 01:10:04,091
But that's not what this is about.

1021
01:10:04,091 --> 01:10:07,175
He asked me about Russia, I asked him about the islands.

1022
01:10:07,175 --> 01:10:09,883
And there's a tribe right there
Thank you.

1023
01:10:09,883 --> 01:10:13,967
dwarf savages,
who hunt with the aid

1024
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:16,967
these little poisoned arrows.

1025
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:19,967
Very similar to what you describe.

1026
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:22,550
Did this tribe have any specialties,

1027
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,551
maybe congenital deformities, or not all toes?

1028
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:28,551
I don't know how I know!

1029
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:31,676
But very much so,
maybe because they live extremely poor.

1030
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:36,009
They say they even sell their children
to the British as servants.

1031
01:10:36,343 --> 01:10:38,468
Gentlemen! This is all very entertaining, of course.

1032
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:40,176
Let's finally talk about the case.

1033
01:10:41,135 --> 01:10:43,551
Anton Pavlovich,

1034
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:44,218
I apologize.

1035
01:10:44,218 --> 01:10:47,260
Anton Pavlovich, I believe your new play is a comedy?

1036
01:10:49,093 --> 01:10:52,427
Oh! It's not just comedy, it's farcical in places.

1037
01:10:55,177 --> 01:10:58,177
I really like the title I came up with

1038
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:02,885
"The Cherry Orchard."

1039
01:11:06,636 --> 01:11:09,469
I'm sorry, could it be cherry?

1040
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:12,469
No, no, no, that's the cherry one.

1041
01:11:12,594 --> 01:11:15,594
Cherry Orchard,

1042
01:11:16,636 --> 01:11:19,053
That sounds beautiful!

1043
01:11:19,053 --> 01:11:20,886
Yes.
Here we go,

1044
01:11:20,886 --> 01:11:23,886
by the way, how's the work going
on the Gorky play?

1045
01:11:24,761 --> 01:11:26,845
It's hard. With this censorship,

1046
01:11:26,845 --> 01:11:29,845
it's a disaster. It's rampant.

1047
01:11:31,137 --> 01:11:32,178
You.
Thank you.

1048
01:11:32,178 --> 01:11:34,887
Well, I've met Gavriil Kharitonovich,

1049
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:36,762
hopefully he'll help us.

1050
01:11:36,762 --> 01:11:40,095
We'll be sure to put on your Cherry Orchard.

1051
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,470
Ha ha ha! I'm telling you, it sounds!

1052
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:45,637
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

1053
01:11:45,637 --> 01:11:47,346
Urgent matters.

1054
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:49,471
Anton Pavlovich was very happy to see you.

1055
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,679
Gilyarovsky, hello!

1056
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:53,679
I will.

1057
01:11:53,763 --> 01:11:55,596
Vladimir Ivanovich,

1058
01:11:55,596 --> 01:11:58,513
if you wouldn't mind grabbing the play.

1059
01:11:58,513 --> 01:12:00,555
What can I say, though?

1060
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:03,555
Stanislavski.
Yes.

1061
01:12:03,555 --> 01:12:06,555
How interesting!

1062
01:12:06,971 --> 01:12:08,430
What's interesting?

1063
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,930
An unusual dramaturgical twist.

1064
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,930
Just like Shakespeare.

1065
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,055
We're the only ones who left. Ð.

1066
01:12:14,055 --> 01:12:19,055
So?
Konstantin Sergeyevich
says it's a high-profile murder,

1067
01:12:19,514 --> 01:12:20,639
you can't blame someone else!

1068
01:12:21,847 --> 01:12:23,889
You really didn't find anything?

1069
01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:25,806
Nothing.

1070
01:12:25,806 --> 01:12:28,056
It's a hell of a thing.

1071
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:31,056
What's this?
Come on.

1072
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:36,973
Well, some kind of note.

1073
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:39,389
To whom it is addressed is unclear.

1074
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:42,390
I don't know how many of these are written in a day.

1075
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:46,431
I beg your pardon, Fedot Ivanovich, there's an inconsolable widow.

1076
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:52,473
Ooh! Excuse me, gentlemen,
I must leave you for a moment.

1077
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:54,682
I beg you, don't touch anything here.

1078
01:12:54,682 --> 01:12:57,682
Yeah, yeah, sure,

1079
01:12:59,349 --> 01:13:02,349
Please don't touch anything!

1080
01:13:02,557 --> 01:13:05,557
Maykov with me!

1081
01:13:11,729 --> 01:13:13,729
(widow's lament)

1082
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,724
I apologize.

1083
01:13:22,187 --> 01:13:23,683
This note is addressed to us.

1084
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:27,516
The foreigner you're interested in,

1085
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:30,517
is staying in a hotel, and there's no name.

1086
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:32,808
Why do you think this note is addressed to us?

1087
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:37,642
But I think the foreigner
is the Englishman who's supposedly the investigator.

1088
01:13:38,684 --> 01:13:40,225
Why go to all this trouble?

1089
01:13:40,225 --> 01:13:42,975
Why didn't Testov just tell us that?

1090
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:44,267
So he couldn't.

1091
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:47,017
This note was written
right after we talked to him.

1092
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:52,351
We were discussing the necklace, the ragamuffin.
and the Englishman who was interested in the necklace.

1093
01:13:53,643 --> 01:13:57,059
Testov is killed right after he tells us
he tells us about the Englishman.

1094
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,434
Could the murderer be an Englishman?

1095
01:13:59,434 --> 01:14:00,351
Why not a ragamuffin?

1096
01:14:01,518 --> 01:14:04,476
Testov was killed just like Raju and his nephew.

1097
01:14:04,476 --> 01:14:08,477
And darts are such a rare weapon
that I'm sure the killer is the same person.

1098
01:14:09,018 --> 01:14:10,602
Besides, you said it yourself,

1099
01:14:10,602 --> 01:14:12,977
Where are the Hitrovians and where are the darts.

1100
01:14:12,977 --> 01:14:15,977
And how did the Englishman know
that Testov was telling us about him?

1101
01:14:16,977 --> 01:14:19,060
He was probably eavesdropping on us.

1102
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:22,060
There's a back door somewhere.

1103
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:26,352
Yes,... nothing to hold on to.

1104
01:14:27,644 --> 01:14:30,644
Here, let me see,

1105
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:39,436
Ha! Looks like Testov before he died,

1106
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:42,436
wrote another note.

1107
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:59,270
I never would have thought to perform
that kind of manipulation.

1108
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,395
How come?

1109
01:15:01,395 --> 01:15:02,520
I told you.

1110
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,312
when I was a kid, I dreamed of being a Pinkerton.

1111
01:15:05,312 --> 01:15:09,396
In one of his investigations,
he found the killer that way.

1112
01:15:10,937 --> 01:15:13,938
Gateway Quay near the abandoned docks.

1113
01:15:15,104 --> 01:15:17,354
Awesome! Awesome!

1114
01:15:17,354 --> 01:15:19,479
So you know where it is?

1115
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:21,188
Let's find it.

1116
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:23,438
I'm more than sure this is the meeting place,

1117
01:15:23,438 --> 01:15:25,730
an Englishman and a ragamuffin.

1118
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:28,730
We have to hurry.

1119
01:15:54,314 --> 01:15:56,273
They were supposed to meet somewhere around here.

1120
01:16:12,023 --> 01:16:15,023
See also,

1121
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:18,021
(Crows cawing)

1122
01:16:18,982 --> 01:16:21,982
(Gilyarovsky) Aha! There's our virtuoso.

1123
01:16:22,815 --> 01:16:24,816
Please make your acquaintance.

1124
01:16:24,816 --> 01:16:27,149
The legendary thief of Khitrov,

1125
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:30,149
Mr. Baldoch. Rudnikov will be so happy.

1126
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:33,816
He chased him around Khitrovka for a long time.

1127
01:16:40,608 --> 01:16:43,608
(Stanislavsky) What a horrible death.
(Gilyarovsky) Yeah!

1128
01:16:46,358 --> 01:16:49,775
Believe me, there's a lot of jiu-jitsu involved,
it's not without jiu-jitsu.

1129
01:16:51,442 --> 01:16:53,733
Look, same weird footprints,

1130
01:16:53,733 --> 01:16:56,734
that we saw at Raja's house.

1131
01:16:58,442 --> 01:17:01,442
So there were two perps.

1132
01:17:02,442 --> 01:17:04,401
Our Englishman and some unknown.

1133
01:17:04,401 --> 01:17:07,401
a creature with a two-toed foot.

1134
01:17:07,692 --> 01:17:10,692
It's all very similar to what Chekhov was talking about.

1135
01:17:11,442 --> 01:17:13,984
I think there's something to this

1136
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:16,984
a dwarf savage from the Andaman Islands.

1137
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:20,151
So you think an Englishman

1138
01:17:20,151 --> 01:17:23,443
brought to Russia from who knows where, this savage?

1139
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:27,068
Why go to such pains?

1140
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,027
Then the dwarf has a unique weapon,

1141
01:17:30,027 --> 01:17:33,027
darts that bring instant death!

1142
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:37,027
Maybe, maybe.

1143
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,152
All right, let's get out of here.

1144
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:41,152
There's nothing more for us to do here,
so let Rudnikov handle it.

1145
01:17:44,611 --> 01:17:47,402
So you're saying
that the Englishman brought a dwarf.

1146
01:17:48,652 --> 01:17:49,611
Why is Baldoch killed

1147
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:52,611
not with a dart? Because a fight broke out.

1148
01:17:52,819 --> 01:17:56,236
I think I understand Boldoch. He escaped from the penitentiary

1149
01:17:56,236 --> 01:18:00,486
and hid at Raja's house,
and the princess knew about it and visited him there.

1150
01:18:00,945 --> 01:18:04,278
She also dropped her handkerchief there, so she is silent,

1151
01:18:04,986 --> 01:18:07,736
He's afraid to give Baldoch up.

1152
01:18:07,736 --> 01:18:09,070
Baldoh happened to see the killers

1153
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:12,028
Raji and scared them away.

1154
01:18:12,028 --> 01:18:13,778
While he was hiding out at Raji's,

1155
01:18:13,778 --> 01:18:17,237
must have gotten a glimpse of the stash.
and when Raju was killed,

1156
01:18:17,737 --> 01:18:19,612
seized the moment,

1157
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,612
somehow managed to open the stash,

1158
01:18:22,987 --> 01:18:25,987
stole the necklace and wanted to sell it to Testov.

1159
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:30,362
Testov decided not to get his hands dirty and sent an Englishman
the Englishman for the necklace.

1160
01:18:30,987 --> 01:18:35,529
Baldoch recognized the Englishman as the murderer and realized that he would not get out of here alive.
he would never get out of here alive.

1161
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:38,779
That's why it's probably English,
and the necklace, already

1162
01:18:38,779 --> 01:18:41,780
somewhere very far away.

1163
01:18:42,905 --> 01:18:44,571
Nah, Baldock is an experienced thief.

1164
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:47,571
He wouldn't take the necklace
to meet the unsub.

1165
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,530
In that case, we need to understand,

1166
01:18:50,572 --> 01:18:53,572
what this Englishman will do now.

1167
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:55,697
Will be looking for Baldoch's stash.

1168
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:58,364
Well, or people who know where the stash is.

1169
01:18:58,364 --> 01:19:00,030
Like the princess.

1170
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:03,030
She's on the police force, you can't get her that easily.

1171
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:05,739
Yes. But we're not going to see her until tomorrow.

1172
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:08,739
Do you have any plans for tonight?

1173
01:19:09,197 --> 01:19:10,781
There will always be plans.

1174
01:19:10,781 --> 01:19:11,906
Then we'll have to cancel them.

1175
01:19:11,906 --> 01:19:13,906
We're playing Chekhov tonight at 8:00.

1176
01:19:13,906 --> 01:19:15,948
You haven't seen his Three Sisters yet, have you?

1177
01:19:15,948 --> 01:19:18,948
No.
It's fine.

1178
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:23,396
Tararabumbia, I'm sitting on a bollard.

1179
01:19:23,448 --> 01:19:25,240
And I weep bitterly.

1180
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,740
He's just sitting there,

1181
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,990
sits.

1182
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:30,782
Why?

1183
01:19:30,782 --> 01:19:32,490
Nothing.

1184
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:35,490
Did you love my mother?

1185
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:37,407
Very much so.

1186
01:19:37,407 --> 01:19:40,949
When you take happiness in bits and pieces,

1187
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:43,157
and then you lose it.

1188
01:19:43,157 --> 01:19:44,741
Like me.

1189
01:19:44,741 --> 01:19:47,741
You're getting rougher little by little,

1190
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:50,741
you get mean.

1191
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:55,783
That's where I'm simmering.

1192
01:19:59,854 --> 01:20:01,854
(disturbing music)

1193
01:20:07,812 --> 01:20:09,812
(dogs barking)

1194
01:20:45,896 --> 01:20:47,896
(Door creaks)

1195
01:20:52,493 --> 01:20:54,202
What can I get you?

1196
01:20:54,202 --> 01:20:56,077
My name is William Fox.

1197
01:20:56,077 --> 01:20:59,077
I'm a representative of a charity
"Angels of Peace.

1198
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,494
We help people of noble birth,
in difficult situations.

1199
01:21:05,411 --> 01:21:07,286
There's a lady sitting here.

1200
01:21:07,286 --> 01:21:10,327
I'd like to talk to her.
Not allowed.

1201
01:21:23,437 --> 01:21:25,437
Bravo! Bravo!

1202
01:21:33,604 --> 01:21:35,604
Bravo!

1203
01:21:44,646 --> 01:21:46,646
(applause)

1204
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:09,038
I'm William Fox,

1205
01:22:10,247 --> 01:22:13,247
from a British charity.

1206
01:22:14,955 --> 01:22:17,955
For a foreigner, you speak good Russian.

1207
01:22:19,664 --> 01:22:22,664
I've been traveling around Russia for two years now.

1208
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:26,789
I like your country,

1209
01:22:26,789 --> 01:22:29,581
a lot of fun,

1210
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:32,581
but that's not what this is about.

1211
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:36,039
I have a business proposition for you.

1212
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:39,789
I don't do business with strangers.

1213
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:41,081
And we know each other.

1214
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:44,081
Ksenia Andreyevna,

1215
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:47,498
in absentia through Baldoch.

1216
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:51,290
I don't know that one.

1217
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:54,290
He has a thing, my thing, a very trifling thing.

1218
01:22:55,207 --> 01:22:57,040
It has value only to me,

1219
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,040
because it belonged to my late mother.

1220
01:23:01,415 --> 01:23:03,790
Well, ask him.

1221
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,332
Give her back to me.

1222
01:23:05,332 --> 01:23:08,332
I'll pay 5,000 rubles.

1223
01:23:10,207 --> 01:23:13,208
For nothing?

1224
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:22,500
Meet Ponda, my servant.

1225
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:26,458
A very unusual creature.

1226
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,250
The last of Jarova's tribe of cannibals,

1227
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,250
from the Andaman Islands.

1228
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:37,750
Fires poisoned darts without missing a beat.

1229
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,750
One scratch and the man is dead.

1230
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:44,292
Go on, Pongo, go on.

1231
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:44,917
You're scary.

1232
01:23:44,917 --> 01:23:48,042
Mademoiselle.

1233
01:23:48,042 --> 01:23:51,292
Pongo is basically an animal.
You never know what he'll do.

1234
01:23:55,209 --> 01:23:58,209
Okay, where were we?

1235
01:23:58,751 --> 01:24:01,751
Oh, yeah, that thing.

1236
01:24:01,793 --> 01:24:03,335
It was my mother's.

1237
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:06,210
It's priceless to me.

1238
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:09,210
I want to know where that thing is.

1239
01:24:11,168 --> 01:24:13,752
I don't know,

1240
01:24:13,752 --> 01:24:16,419
Ask Baldoch if you can find it.

1241
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:19,669
I'm afraid he'll never tell anyone again.

1242
01:24:20,585 --> 01:24:23,585
Think about it.

1243
01:24:32,836 --> 01:24:35,378
That's it! Come on.

1244
01:24:35,378 --> 01:24:38,169
Well, Vladimir Alexeyevich,

1245
01:24:38,169 --> 01:24:41,170
I guess you can't avoid a great article

1246
01:24:42,003 --> 01:24:45,003
on the efficient work of the Moscow detective service.

1247
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:47,295
Why, is there any good news?

1248
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:48,545
Well, of course.

1249
01:24:48,545 --> 01:24:51,337
You're the one who brought them to me.

1250
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:53,628
Found the killer,

1251
01:24:53,628 --> 01:24:57,462
a Baldoch, a thief and a convict on the run,

1252
01:24:58,045 --> 01:25:01,795
who has disposed of respectable gentlemen,
with particular cruelty.

1253
01:25:02,462 --> 01:25:05,462
And the reasons why, we unfortunately can't know,

1254
01:25:05,587 --> 01:25:08,921
because his own accomplices
killed him themselves. Ð!

1255
01:25:09,462 --> 01:25:12,463
(Stanislavsky) Well, you know it's not him.

1256
01:25:13,171 --> 01:25:15,421
That's it, case closed.

1257
01:25:15,421 --> 01:25:19,713
Besides, I'm going to make
a report to the chief of police.

1258
01:25:21,921 --> 01:25:26,296
Good! Ð! Fedot, may I have a word with the Princess?

1259
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,380
Beautiful woman!

1260
01:25:33,005 --> 01:25:34,755
But, stupid is stupid.

1261
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:37,714
All women are stupid!

1262
01:25:37,714 --> 01:25:39,547
How many times have I told her,

1263
01:25:39,547 --> 01:25:42,130
you have to build relationships with decent people.

1264
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:45,131
And she got involved with this Baldoh.

1265
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:49,714
They all come, the same way.

1266
01:25:49,714 --> 01:25:51,131
Teach them, teach them.

1267
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:52,881
Fedot, huh?

1268
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,881
So I put her down,

1269
01:25:57,339 --> 01:25:59,923
How'd they let you go?

1270
01:25:59,923 --> 01:26:01,590
There you go,

1271
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:03,256
hold it back, wrong, let it go.

1272
01:26:03,256 --> 01:26:05,048
wrong, what am I supposed to do?

1273
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:05,923
What have you done?

1274
01:26:05,923 --> 01:26:08,923
She is now in mortal danger.

1275
01:26:29,049 --> 01:26:40,396
(street noise)

1276
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:10,229
(bazaar noise)

1277
01:28:40,555 --> 01:28:43,555
Hello, Mademoiselle!

1278
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:51,222
Have you decided something?

1279
01:28:52,097 --> 01:28:55,097
I asked you to help me find my mother's item.

1280
01:28:58,271 --> 01:29:00,271
(disturbing music)

1281
01:29:11,806 --> 01:29:14,806
All right. Uh-huh,

1282
01:29:15,098 --> 01:29:18,098
I'll check the stash, but I'll go alone.

1283
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,848
I don't feel right about giving away secret places.

1284
01:29:22,181 --> 01:29:24,723
If there's anything in there, I'll get it,

1285
01:29:24,723 --> 01:29:25,390
wherever you say,

1286
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:28,390
in two hours.

1287
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:39,390
Don't play games with me.

1288
01:29:40,599 --> 01:29:42,015
If there's something you're not happy about,

1289
01:29:42,015 --> 01:29:45,016
let your freak kill me right now,

1290
01:29:50,099 --> 01:29:51,224
In two hours,

1291
01:29:51,224 --> 01:29:55,808
There will be a carriage parked outside the inn.

1292
01:30:00,225 --> 01:30:01,766
Ponga will be on the goats,

1293
01:30:03,516 --> 01:30:05,808
you can't go wrong.

1294
01:30:05,808 --> 01:30:07,391
And don't let your freak follow me around.

1295
01:30:07,391 --> 01:30:11,100
Otherwise, you'll never see
the thing that belonged

1296
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,100
to your mother.

1297
01:30:16,184 --> 01:30:19,184
It's a deal.

1298
01:30:19,267 --> 01:30:21,642
I hope you realize that deceiving me

1299
01:30:21,642 --> 01:30:24,642
there's no point.

1300
01:30:47,226 --> 01:31:08,394
Hey! Dude! Come here!

1301
01:31:16,561 --> 01:31:19,561
Listen, Princess, you're a beautiful woman.

1302
01:31:20,186 --> 01:31:21,561
Boldoh has been killed.

1303
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:23,145
Come on, you'll be my mammy.

1304
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:24,770
There's not enough money.

1305
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,936
Well, we'll see about that.

1306
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:28,937
All right, listen up.

1307
01:32:39,398 --> 01:32:42,398
Did Baldoch leave a big inheritance?

1308
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:47,315
He did, he didn't,

1309
01:32:47,315 --> 01:32:49,148
what business is it of yours!

1310
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:51,398
What's Baldoha's is mine.

1311
01:32:51,398 --> 01:32:54,315
You know the law.

1312
01:32:54,315 --> 01:32:55,732
No offense.

1313
01:32:55,732 --> 01:32:58,732
Give me what you got

1314
01:33:39,025 --> 01:33:42,025
What a jerk!

1315
01:33:45,067 --> 01:33:47,776
You bitch! Who you think you're fooling!

1316
01:33:47,776 --> 01:33:50,609
I'm gonna paint your face so bad,
that the very last

1317
01:33:50,609 --> 01:33:53,609
a beggar won't take you!

1318
01:33:54,734 --> 01:33:55,734
Draw as much as you want!

1319
01:33:55,734 --> 01:33:58,734
No, there's nothing else.

1320
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:16,194
What are you watching?

1321
01:34:16,194 --> 01:34:18,104
Get out!

1322
01:34:23,479 --> 01:34:25,479
(Pantaloons! Let's get the knickers!

1323
01:34:29,187 --> 01:34:31,187
Handkerchiefs, handkerchiefs. Coming up! Let's buy!

1324
01:35:58,687 --> 01:36:00,687
(lock clicks)

1325
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,448
Would you like to see it?

1326
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:24,366
You're a very beautiful woman.

1327
01:36:24,866 --> 01:36:27,866
I would suggest that you come with me,

1328
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:31,449
but I don't think you'd agree.

1329
01:36:35,408 --> 01:36:38,408
I disagree.

1330
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:50,075
Aren't you forgetting something?

1331
01:37:00,534 --> 01:37:03,534
Thank you.

1332
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:07,159
It's nice to do business with a real gentleman.

1333
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:26,743
Did you?

1334
01:37:26,743 --> 01:37:28,452
I did.
Good for you!

1335
01:37:28,452 --> 01:37:29,743
Go to the rear!

1336
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:32,202
I'll take command of the operation.

1337
01:37:32,202 --> 01:37:34,993
Fedot Ivanovich, good to see you!

1338
01:37:34,993 --> 01:37:37,119
Dear Avdotya Mikhailovna!

1339
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,535
How is Platon Afanasyevich's health?

1340
01:37:38,535 --> 01:37:41,452
I hope all is well. Bow to him.

1341
01:37:41,452 --> 01:37:44,452
And here I am. catching a dangerous criminal.

1342
01:37:44,452 --> 01:37:45,744
Fedot, maybe it's time to start.

1343
01:37:45,744 --> 01:37:48,744
I'll ask you not to interfere.
I have everything under control.

1344
01:37:49,327 --> 01:37:52,328
Maykov, follow me!
Surround the carriage!

1345
01:38:06,203 --> 01:38:07,328
Well? Where's the perpetrator?

1346
01:38:07,328 --> 01:38:10,328
Goddamn English.

1347
01:38:11,287 --> 01:38:13,745
Where could they have gone?

1348
01:38:13,745 --> 01:38:17,245
Petrukhin! Go to the inn and search it. Move it!

1349
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,412
Fedot Ivanovich, everything was sealed off, no mouse could get through.

1350
01:38:20,412 --> 01:38:21,287
What mouse?

1351
01:38:21,287 --> 01:38:22,120
Where are they then?

1352
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,579
You've gone to heaven?

1353
01:38:23,579 --> 01:38:25,246
They are not saints. Search!

1354
01:38:25,246 --> 01:38:27,037
Vladimir Alekseyevich,
Yes

1355
01:38:27,037 --> 01:38:29,371
Konstantin Sergeyevich.

1356
01:38:29,371 --> 01:38:32,371
What's up? What you got there?

1357
01:38:33,579 --> 01:38:36,579
Oh, you're so sly! Ð!

1358
01:38:36,621 --> 01:38:40,205
That's where the Neglinnaya River flows below us.
and flows into the Bypass Canal.

1359
01:38:40,788 --> 01:38:44,163
This tunnel,
I know like the back of my hand, it's not going anywhere!

1360
01:38:45,205 --> 01:38:48,288
But you're not welcome with me,
or the suit.... you'll have to forget it.

1361
01:38:48,538 --> 01:38:49,413
Don't get your hopes up.

1362
01:38:49,413 --> 01:38:52,247
It's that easy,
you're not getting rid of me.
Suit yourself.

1363
01:38:55,205 --> 01:38:58,205
Fedot Ivanovich, you give us two policemen,

1364
01:38:58,330 --> 01:39:02,164
You take a boat and meet us there,
where the Neglinnaya

1365
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:05,331
into the bypass canal. I got it!

1366
01:39:08,831 --> 01:39:10,664
I don't know what to do.

1367
01:39:10,664 --> 01:39:13,664
Look, the director's coming too.

1368
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:16,748
All right, two over here!

1369
01:39:16,748 --> 01:39:18,539
Maykov, the rest of you, follow me!

1370
01:39:18,539 --> 01:39:21,248
Quickly to the Crimean bridge, take a boat.

1371
01:39:21,248 --> 01:39:24,248
And to the canal. We'll meet them there!

1372
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:30,729
(water running)

1373
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:42,707
Oh, my God, what is that?

1374
01:39:44,082 --> 01:39:45,749
There's a lot more to see here!

1375
01:39:45,749 --> 01:39:48,749
I don't think this canal's been cleaned since Catherine the Great.
the Great.

1376
01:39:51,541 --> 01:39:53,874
Gentlemen, we're going to have to split up here.

1377
01:39:53,874 --> 01:39:56,874
You go down this tunnel, we'll go down this tunnel.

1378
01:39:56,958 --> 01:39:58,708
They both go into the bypass channel.

1379
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:01,208
That's where we'll take the Englishman down.

1380
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:04,125
Konstantin Sergeyevich, take the flashlight.

1381
01:40:04,125 --> 01:40:07,125
Hands, I could still use them.

1382
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,250
Let's go.

1383
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:12,250
Thank you

1384
01:40:30,584 --> 01:40:33,584
Careful.

1385
01:40:34,918 --> 01:40:37,918
Uh, hold on.

1386
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:42,751
Check it out,

1387
01:40:43,543 --> 01:40:46,543
(Gilyarovsky) What?
(Stanislavsky) No, it seemed to me.

1388
01:40:51,043 --> 01:40:51,668
And you're sure

1389
01:40:51,668 --> 01:40:54,793
that the Englishman isn't waiting for us here, anywhere?

1390
01:40:55,335 --> 01:40:56,252
I'm not sure.

1391
01:40:56,252 --> 01:40:57,835
But I know for a fact, we need to get here as soon as possible,

1392
01:40:57,835 --> 01:40:59,502
we need to find a way out.

1393
01:40:59,502 --> 01:41:02,502
Let's go.

1394
01:41:45,796 --> 01:41:46,504
Don't fall behind

1395
01:41:46,504 --> 01:41:47,462
Konstantin Sergeyevich,

1396
01:41:59,379 --> 01:42:02,380
Mr. Gilyarovsky?

1397
01:42:09,713 --> 01:42:12,713
I don't have the honor of knowing you.
You don't have to,

1398
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:17,255
Don't follow me

1399
01:42:17,255 --> 01:42:20,255
and everybody walks out of here alive.

1400
01:42:22,562 --> 01:42:24,562
Haa!

1401
01:42:30,104 --> 01:42:32,104
(fighting noises)

1402
01:42:32,923 --> 01:42:37,646
Aah! Yes!

1403
01:42:43,187 --> 01:42:45,187
Aah!

1404
01:42:53,882 --> 01:42:56,882
And like this!

1405
01:43:31,687 --> 01:43:35,646
Aah!

1406
01:43:40,687 --> 01:43:42,687
Aah! Well, what did you think.

1407
01:43:50,342 --> 01:43:55,812
Uh-huh!

1408
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:08,521
Ah-ha-ha!

1409
01:44:43,095 --> 01:44:46,062
Oh, yeah!

1410
01:44:47,146 --> 01:44:49,146
Aah!

1411
01:45:00,012 --> 01:45:03,012
Well! Well! Eh!

1412
01:45:04,137 --> 01:45:07,137
I'll get you now!

1413
01:45:30,396 --> 01:45:30,437
Well, you were great!

1414
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:31,722
Thank you.

1415
01:45:31,722 --> 01:45:34,597
Are you all right?
As you can see.

1416
01:45:34,597 --> 01:45:37,597
Give me your hand,

1417
01:45:38,264 --> 01:45:41,264
Maybe you shouldn't hold on.
Ð!

1418
01:45:42,889 --> 01:45:45,639
Oooh! Well!

1419
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:48,639
Thank you.

1420
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:53,931
We've got to keep that bastard from getting away.

1421
01:45:55,223 --> 01:45:58,223
I know my way around. We're gonna give him one!

1422
01:46:15,515 --> 01:46:17,557
See also,

1423
01:46:17,557 --> 01:46:20,557
it's them.

1424
01:46:31,104 --> 01:46:33,104
(boat noises)

1425
01:46:33,641 --> 01:46:34,724
Where's the boat from?

1426
01:46:34,724 --> 01:46:36,141
Where from? From where?

1427
01:46:36,141 --> 01:46:38,349
The bastard's prepared!

1428
01:46:38,349 --> 01:46:41,350
Hey, on the beach!

1429
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:44,391
Look, it's Rudnikov.

1430
01:46:45,687 --> 01:46:47,687
Hey! Hey!

1431
01:46:47,766 --> 01:46:50,767
All right, we're gonna jump.

1432
01:46:54,475 --> 01:46:56,271
Slow down, Fedot Ivanovich! Slow down.

1433
01:46:56,937 --> 01:46:58,937
Let's go! Jump!

1434
01:46:59,767 --> 01:47:01,434
Are we gonna jump?

1435
01:47:01,434 --> 01:47:03,142
Yeah, we're gonna jump.

1436
01:47:03,142 --> 01:47:05,684
Come on, come on, come on.

1437
01:47:05,684 --> 01:47:09,184
Go! Move! Move!

1438
01:47:10,559 --> 01:47:12,184
You've been through a lot.

1439
01:47:12,184 --> 01:47:13,893
We missed the perp.

1440
01:47:13,893 --> 01:47:16,976
Ah, we did it on purpose, Fedot Ivanovich,
so that you wouldn't be out of work.

1441
01:47:17,226 --> 01:47:18,476
That's right.

1442
01:47:18,476 --> 01:47:21,476
Investigations should be handled by professionals.

1443
01:47:22,935 --> 01:47:25,935
Go! Go faster!

1444
01:47:28,604 --> 01:47:30,604
(boat noises)

1445
01:47:34,477 --> 01:47:37,477
Come on, come on, come on!

1446
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:07,770
What's he got, dynamite?

1447
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:13,478
Maykov, get the horn!

1448
01:48:17,645 --> 01:48:20,645
Hey there, on the boat!

1449
01:48:20,729 --> 01:48:24,021
Stop the rudeness!
No more dynamite!

1450
01:48:26,354 --> 01:48:28,562
Get to shore now!

1451
01:48:28,562 --> 01:48:29,229
Well, Fedot!

1452
01:48:29,229 --> 01:48:32,229
That's how he'll dock.

1453
01:48:36,938 --> 01:48:39,938
You foreign devil!

1454
01:48:40,355 --> 01:48:43,355
Fyodor Ivanovich, he'll sink us.

1455
01:48:43,646 --> 01:48:46,646
Konstantin Sergeyevich, can you swim?

1456
01:48:46,771 --> 01:48:49,938
No.
Magnificent!
Stand down!

1457
01:48:50,647 --> 01:48:52,522
We'll take them alive!

1458
01:48:52,522 --> 01:48:55,522
Kukushkin, boarding party!

1459
01:49:00,355 --> 01:49:02,314
Cuckoo, jump! Where to jump?

1460
01:49:02,314 --> 01:49:05,314
Fedot Ivanovich!
Come on, come on, come on.

1461
01:49:19,481 --> 01:49:22,481
Fedot, Kukushkin has flown away!
Won't he drown?
No!

1462
01:49:22,606 --> 01:49:25,606
(Rudnikov) Kukushkin is not sinking.

1463
01:49:34,565 --> 01:49:37,149
What, are you gonna shoot?

1464
01:49:37,149 --> 01:49:38,065
Don't get caught in the cauldron.

1465
01:49:38,065 --> 01:49:39,690
He's got a warehouse full of dynamite, it's gonna blow up,

1466
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:41,440
we won't pick up any bones.

1467
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,565
I'm the best shot in the entire imperial police force.

1468
01:49:43,565 --> 01:49:46,941
I beg you, Fedot!
Don't talk under your arm.

1469
01:49:50,812 --> 01:49:52,812
(explosion noise)

1470
01:50:04,608 --> 01:50:07,608
Stop car!

1471
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:28,651
Yeah! There was an Englishman,

1472
01:50:29,317 --> 01:50:31,234
Well, he's not.

1473
01:50:31,234 --> 01:50:34,109
And no one will ever see the necklace again.

1474
01:50:34,109 --> 01:50:35,943
"Spark of the East."

1475
01:50:35,943 --> 01:50:38,943
Just like a good tragedy.

1476
01:50:46,235 --> 01:50:49,985
Here, a set by our artist Simov.

1477
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:52,360
Victor Andreevich,

1478
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:56,069
Here we'll be performing Maxim Gorky's play.
"At the Bottom."

1479
01:50:57,402 --> 01:51:00,110
That's great!

1480
01:51:00,110 --> 01:51:02,444
Like in life.

1481
01:51:02,444 --> 01:51:04,569
Yes, indeed,

1482
01:51:04,569 --> 01:51:07,694
it's like being in a Heathrow's lodging house.

1483
01:51:08,486 --> 01:51:11,402
By the way, Fedot Ivanovich, may I congratulate you?

1484
01:51:11,402 --> 01:51:13,486
The Order of Stanislaus is a worthy award!

1485
01:51:15,194 --> 01:51:17,444
With swords.

1486
01:51:17,444 --> 01:51:19,194
Although, to be fair,

1487
01:51:19,194 --> 01:51:22,195
I don't know what that was about.

1488
01:51:23,278 --> 01:51:26,653
Foreigners, some dwarves, poisoned arrows.

1489
01:51:28,237 --> 01:51:31,237
Where did all this come from in the capital city?

1490
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,195
Noooo! That's a bloody weird one.

1491
01:51:34,195 --> 01:51:37,195
No stranger than human nature.

1492
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:41,654
I think this story can be sufficiently

1493
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:46,904
to accurately reconstruct,
based on human motives

1494
01:51:48,112 --> 01:51:51,112
and actions.

1495
01:51:51,196 --> 01:51:53,279
Well, give it a try.

1496
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:58,363
This story started 10 -15 years ago in India.

1497
01:52:14,822 --> 01:52:17,030
In this most ancient

1498
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:20,030
and a beautiful country

1499
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:24,531
enslaved by the British,

1500
01:52:34,989 --> 01:52:36,198
during the suppression

1501
01:52:36,198 --> 01:52:40,281
of King Sekim's rebellion against the British, from his palace in

1502
01:52:40,531 --> 01:52:45,531
Tamlong, the unique "Spark of the East" necklace is missing.

1503
01:52:46,823 --> 01:52:49,532
I'm pretty sure it was stolen by our

1504
01:52:49,532 --> 01:52:52,532
Raja, who was then in the British army.

1505
01:52:52,948 --> 01:52:56,324
and a certain English officer, Benjamin Norris.

1506
01:52:58,032 --> 01:52:59,865
This story was very high-profile,

1507
01:52:59,865 --> 01:53:04,741
it was all over the British papers,
and I found out about her

1508
01:53:04,741 --> 01:53:07,741
from our painter Vereshchagin,

1509
01:53:07,782 --> 01:53:10,782
who was living in India at the time.

1510
01:53:18,699 --> 01:53:20,200
However,

1511
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,700
Raja and Norris managed to get away with it.

1512
01:53:23,741 --> 01:53:26,700
Their guilt could not be proven.

1513
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,658
Soon, however,

1514
01:53:28,658 --> 01:53:31,325
for some other serious offense,

1515
01:53:31,325 --> 01:53:35,617
Norris was exiled to penal servitude, in the Andaman Islands.

1516
01:53:38,825 --> 01:53:40,784
Raja

1517
01:53:40,784 --> 01:53:43,784
took advantage of the moment and ran away,

1518
01:53:44,659 --> 01:53:47,492
taking the necklace with her.

1519
01:53:47,492 --> 01:53:50,534
Thanks to Chekhov, we know that at the time, passing by.

1520
01:53:50,742 --> 01:53:54,159
Andaman Islands, the Russian steamship "Petersburg" sailed by.

1521
01:53:54,784 --> 01:53:58,284
That's how Raja traveled to Russia.

1522
01:53:58,659 --> 01:54:00,535
Subsequently, settling down

1523
01:54:00,535 --> 01:54:03,535
on Khitrovka.

1524
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:06,576
However, Norris

1525
01:54:06,576 --> 01:54:08,910
managed to escape from hard labor,

1526
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:11,910
and he immediately began searching for his companion.

1527
01:54:12,577 --> 01:54:15,577
Somehow, he met Testov,

1528
01:54:15,577 --> 01:54:18,577
who was already a famous collector at the time.

1529
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:22,660
Of course, he knew of the existence of Spark East.
and most likely,

1530
01:54:23,452 --> 01:54:26,452
had already met Rajoy by then.

1531
01:54:28,452 --> 01:54:30,827
It was Testov

1532
01:54:30,827 --> 01:54:32,869
prompted Norris,

1533
01:54:32,869 --> 01:54:35,869
where to find Raju.

1534
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:39,536
That's how Norris got to Khitrovka.

1535
01:54:39,536 --> 01:54:43,161
The night we found Raju dead.
Raju, in his own home.

1536
01:54:44,203 --> 01:54:46,995
Well, it's all very interesting, of course.

1537
01:54:46,995 --> 01:54:49,995
But there's no way we can verify your story.

1538
01:54:50,203 --> 01:54:52,745
Understand, in art, facts are not that important.

1539
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:55,662
If you're

1540
01:54:55,662 --> 01:54:58,454
managed to convince the viewer,

1541
01:54:58,454 --> 01:55:01,454
then what you've created is the truth.

1542
01:55:03,370 --> 01:55:05,371
Allahu Akbar

1543
01:55:05,371 --> 01:55:08,371
(praying in Arabic)

1544
01:55:12,913 --> 01:55:15,913
Is that what a person is?

1545
01:55:16,871 --> 01:55:19,871
A person is not you,

1546
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:25,705
not me, not them.

1547
01:55:25,705 --> 01:55:28,705
No, the person is you, I'm them,

1548
01:55:28,747 --> 01:55:31,747
the old man, Napoleon,

1549
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:34,830
Mohammed, in one.

1550
01:55:37,205 --> 01:55:39,747
This is huge.

1551
01:55:39,747 --> 01:55:42,747
Do you understand?

1552
01:55:46,789 --> 01:55:48,456
In this one,

1553
01:55:48,456 --> 01:55:50,581
all the beginnings.

1554
01:55:50,581 --> 01:55:53,123
All ends.

1555
01:55:53,123 --> 01:55:56,123
It's all in the man,

1556
01:55:56,206 --> 01:55:59,206
everything for man,

1557
01:56:00,165 --> 01:56:03,165
only human beings exist.

1558
01:56:04,665 --> 01:56:07,498
Everything else is just

1559
01:56:07,498 --> 01:56:09,790
his handiwork

1560
01:56:09,790 --> 01:56:12,040
and his brain.

1561
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:15,040
Chelovec.

1562
01:56:15,457 --> 01:56:18,457
That sounds

1563
01:56:21,999 --> 01:56:24,999
proudly.

1564
01:56:26,437 --> 01:56:28,437
Bravo! Bravo!

1565
01:57:16,709 --> 01:57:19,334
Konstantin Sergeyevich,

1566
01:57:19,334 --> 01:57:22,335
look who I brought you.

1567
01:57:22,335 --> 01:57:25,335
We just came by to congratulate you on your brilliant premiere.

1568
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:27,751
Did you really like it?

1569
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:30,752
Very much! Very much!

1570
01:57:31,835 --> 01:57:34,627
You said it so well this time,

1571
01:57:34,627 --> 01:57:37,627
A man is a proud word.

1572
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:41,460
It made my heart skip a beat.

1573
01:57:41,502 --> 01:57:44,502
You're a great artist.

1574
01:57:45,127 --> 01:57:48,127
Thank you, Ksenia Andreyevna.

1575
01:57:48,461 --> 01:57:50,377
Not for nothing Vladimir Alexeyevich

1576
01:57:50,377 --> 01:57:53,378
he took me to all the hot spots.
 No way!

1577
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:08,378
It's made for you!

1578
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:16,837
How did you do that?

1579
01:58:20,712 --> 01:58:22,545
You're a very beautiful woman.

1580
01:58:24,087 --> 01:58:27,087
I'd suggest you come away with me,

1581
01:58:27,337 --> 01:58:30,337
but I don't think you'd agree.

1582
01:58:37,088 --> 01:58:39,379
I disagree.

1583
01:58:39,379 --> 01:58:41,421
I wanted to offer you a place in the theater,

1584
01:58:41,421 --> 01:58:44,588
but you're a wealthy lady now,

1585
01:58:45,213 --> 01:58:48,713
and you can live in St. Petersburg or Paris.

1586
01:58:52,047 --> 01:58:54,172
It's so weird.

1587
01:58:54,172 --> 01:58:57,255
This necklace
could provide for me for three lifetimes to come.

1588
01:58:58,964 --> 01:59:01,964
I don't want to leave him.

1589
01:59:02,505 --> 01:59:05,506
Konstantin Sergeyevich, take it.

1590
01:59:05,547 --> 01:59:07,089
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1591
01:59:07,089 --> 01:59:08,131
I'm a lazy man.

1592
01:59:08,131 --> 01:59:10,964
And then I'll stop working altogether.

1593
01:59:10,964 --> 01:59:13,964
Have pity on Nemirovich-Danchenko!

1594
01:59:16,173 --> 01:59:17,839
Konstantin Sergeyevich,

1595
01:59:17,839 --> 01:59:20,548
Vladimir Alexeyevich, welcome.

1596
01:59:20,548 --> 01:59:21,506
Everyone's waiting for you.

1597
01:59:21,506 --> 01:59:24,506
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming,

1598
01:59:24,548 --> 01:59:25,506
Join us.

1599
01:59:25,506 --> 01:59:28,507
Thank you.

1600
01:59:28,590 --> 01:59:30,757
Would you like to join us?

1601
01:59:30,757 --> 01:59:33,757
We're going to the Hermitage to drink champagne in honor
the premiere.

1602
01:59:36,174 --> 01:59:39,174
No, thank you.

1603
01:59:44,437 --> 01:59:46,437
Uncle Gilyai, show me out,

1604
01:59:48,132 --> 01:59:50,091
Where are you going? Your place?

1605
01:59:50,091 --> 01:59:53,091
To Khitrovka.

1606
01:59:53,258 --> 01:59:56,258
Khitrovka?

1607
01:59:59,716 --> 02:00:02,300
Khitrovka, my house.

1608
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,300
I grew up there,

1609
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:07,300
and I'll stay there.

1610
02:00:07,841 --> 02:00:10,842
Somebody's got to sing in the pubs at night.

1611
02:00:13,175 --> 02:00:15,175
Goodbye, Konstantin Sergeyevich!

1612
02:00:18,425 --> 02:00:21,521
Ð¯ .....

1613
02:00:35,759 --> 02:00:38,759
Ksenia Andreyevna,

1614
02:00:50,218 --> 02:00:53,218
I've never met a woman like that.

1615
02:00:53,927 --> 02:00:56,927
You're extraordinary.

1616
02:01:01,844 --> 02:01:04,844
It's a declaration of love.

1617
02:01:09,511 --> 02:01:12,803
Your heart belongs to the theater, Konstantin Sergeyevich.

1618
02:01:18,219 --> 02:01:21,220
Let's go, Uncle Gilyai.

1619
02:01:22,312 --> 02:01:24,312
(sad music)

1620
02:02:06,763 --> 02:02:09,763
Whoa!

1621
02:02:10,513 --> 02:02:13,513
Princess, let me walk you home.

1622
02:02:13,805 --> 02:02:16,680
That kind of wealth will be cut off.

1623
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:19,597
You're not afraid?
I'm not afraid.

1624
02:02:19,597 --> 02:02:22,597
You know me,

1625
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:26,181
All right, then. Bless you.

1626
02:02:26,181 --> 02:02:29,181
Thank you for everything Uncle Gilyai!

1627
02:02:49,473 --> 02:02:52,473
Uncle Gilyai,

1628
02:02:52,807 --> 02:02:55,807
Vladimir Alexeyevich,

1629
02:03:01,724 --> 02:03:04,724
Take it.

1630
02:03:06,224 --> 02:03:09,224
Nah, I'm afraid I'll get drunk.

1631
02:03:10,266 --> 02:03:13,266
I'm not used to living in ideal conditions.

1632
02:03:14,141 --> 02:03:17,141
Keep it.

1633
02:03:17,266 --> 02:03:18,933
What am I supposed to do with him?

1634
02:03:18,933 --> 02:03:21,933
I can't sell it.

1635
02:03:22,016 --> 02:03:26,016
Why, you can split an emerald, melt down a chain.

1636
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:30,017
You'll sell it to your own on Khitrovka, of course, not so expensive,

1637
02:03:30,017 --> 02:03:33,017
as a whole. But still.

1638
02:03:35,017 --> 02:03:38,142
No, I don't want to break it.

1639
02:04:00,021 --> 02:04:02,021
(water splashing)

1640
02:04:08,729 --> 02:04:10,729
Whoo! Ehhh!

1641
02:04:16,435 --> 02:04:19,435
Well, I'd better be going.

1642
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:26,561
At least let me kiss you goodbye.

1643
02:04:38,644 --> 02:04:40,645
Well, goodbye!

1644
02:04:40,645 --> 02:04:43,645
Goodbye!

1645
02:04:56,270 --> 02:04:59,270
Princess!

1646
02:05:00,395 --> 02:05:02,645
I think I've lost my watch.

1647
02:05:02,645 --> 02:05:05,646
Have you seen them?

1648
02:05:08,937 --> 02:05:09,771
All fair and square.

1649
02:05:09,771 --> 02:05:10,271
Uncle Gelay.

1650
02:05:11,354 --> 02:05:14,354
That's my job.

1651
02:05:22,063 --> 02:05:24,313
All right! The truth is yours!

1652
02:05:24,313 --> 02:05:24,688
I'll give you a gift.
