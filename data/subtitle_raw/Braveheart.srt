Ah.

00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,270
Call it a test
ofsoldiery, then.

190
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,773
The English won't let us
train with weapons,

191
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,358
so we train with stones.

192
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,278
The test ofasoldier
is not in his arm.

193
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,613
It's here.

194
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,865

00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,124
Mm-hmm.

Here you go, son.

00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,743
That was a good throw.

204
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,203
Aye. Aye, it was.

205
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:37,083
I was wondering if you could
do that when it matters.

206
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,712
As it--
As it matters in battle.

207
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,632
Could you crush a man
with that throw?

208
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:48,011
I could crush you
like a worm.

Ooh

210
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,473
You could?

211
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,474
Aye.

212
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,100
Well, then do it.

213
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,520
Would you like to see him
crush me like a worm?

214

You look
a wee bit shaky .

the rocks.

will you dance
with me?

Of course I will.

00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,193
Aye, it's that.

248
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:17,030
I was wondering if I might have
a word with your daughter.

249
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,866
What do you want
to have a word about?

250

Well, um...

251
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:25,497
Murron, would you like
to come and ride with me

252
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,624
on this fine evening?

253
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,835
In this?
You're out of your mind.

It's good
Scottish weather, madame.

The rain is falling
straight down.

256

Well, slightly
to the side, like.

257
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,926
She can't go with you.

258
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,470
No the now, anyway.

259
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,638
No the now.

260
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,807
- No the now?
- We'll see you later.

The weather'sjust fine.
It's hardly raining.

262
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,728
Did you not hear
what I said?

264
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,360
It's you she takes after.

265
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,225
How could you know me
after so long?

266
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,727
Well, I didn't.

267
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,105
I saw you staring,
and I didn't know who you were.

268
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,733
I'm sorry.
I suppose I was.

269
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,736
Are you in the habit

270
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,904
of riding off in the rain
with strangers?

271
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:43,241
It was the best way
to make you leave.

272
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:48,747
Well, if I can ever work up
the courage to askyou again,

273
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,331
I'll send
written warning first.

274
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,000
Wouldn't do much good.
I can't read.

275
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,085
Can you not?

276
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,253
No.

277
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,796
Well, that's something

00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,424
we shall have to remedy,
isn't it?

279
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,260

teach me to read, then?

280
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,511

281
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,513
In what language?

282
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:08,725
You're showing off now.

283
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,769
That's right.
Are you impressed yet?

284
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:11,978

and I'll be impressed.

My kilt will fly up,
but I'll try it.

288
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,453
God, you certainly
didn't learn any manners.

289
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,830
The French and Romans
have far worse manners.

290
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,248
You've been to Rome?

291
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,750
Aye. Argyle took me
on a pilgrimage.

292
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,460
What was it like?

293
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,550
What does that mean?

294
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,678

298
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,916

strange of me

to invite Murron
to ride last night,

is another matter.

of meeting?

a waste oftime, Campbell.

and a patriot.

307

I know
who my father was.

308
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,276

to raise crops

309

and, God willing,
a family.

310
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,824

in peace, I will.

311

Go on.

312
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,161
You say you want
to stay out ofthe troubles?

313
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,206
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

314

my answer's no.

got children?

help me with that.

327

to marry you, then?

Well, it's a bit sudden,
but all right.

Is that a "yes"?

Aye, that's a "yes."

ofour laws,

01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:32,921
All right.
Offer them the terms.

737
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:38,343

Shall we go and meet them?

738
01:18:38,426 --> 01:18:40,595
[Mornay]
Let me do the talking.

739
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:41,763
Agreed.

740
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:48,728
Fine speech.

741
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:50,730
Now what do we do?

742
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:54,192
Just be yourselves.

743
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,319
Where are you going?

744
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:59,572
I'm going to pick
a fight.

745
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:00,824
Hyah!

747
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:08,873
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.

748
01:19:11,626 --> 01:19:13,628
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

749
01:19:17,632 --> 01:19:20,260
Here are
the king's terms--

750
01:19:20,343 --> 01:19:24,973
Lead this army
off the field...

751
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:32,397
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

752
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,065
including
hereditary title,

753
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:37,652
from which you will pay--

754
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:39,696
from which you will pay him
an annual duty--

755
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:41,740
I have an offer
foryou.

756
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,575
Cheltham, this is
William Wallace.

757
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:47,412
From which you will pay
the king an annual duty--

758
01:19:47,495 --> 01:19:49,247
I said I have
an offer foryou.

759
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:50,832
You disrespect
a banner oftruce?

760
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:52,751
From his king?
Absolutely.

761
01:19:53,835 --> 01:19:55,837
Here are
Scotland's terms--

762
01:19:55,879 --> 01:19:58,715
Loweryour flags

763
01:19:58,798 --> 01:20:00,216
straight back
to England,

764
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,718
stopping at every home
you pass by

765
01:20:01,801 --> 01:20:02,969
to beg forgiveness

766
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:05,263
for 1 00 years oftheft,
rape, and murder.

767
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:08,558
Do that,
and your men shall live.

768
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:12,562
Do it not, and every one
of you will die today.

769
01:20:12,645 --> 01:20:15,440
Ha ha ha ha!

770
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:20,945
You are outmatched.

771
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:23,239
You have no
heavy cavalry.

772
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:26,076
In two centuries,
no army has won--

773
01:20:26,117 --> 01:20:28,078
I'm not finished!

774
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:31,247
Before we let you leave,

775
01:20:31,331 --> 01:20:34,084
your commander
must cross that field,

776
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:36,795
present himself
before this army,

777
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:38,797
put his head
between his legs,

778
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:40,382
and kiss his own arse.

779
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:54,437
I'd say that was rather
less cordial than he's used to.

780
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:56,272
Be ready and do
exactly as I say.

781
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:57,899
On my signal,

782
01:20:57,982 --> 01:21:01,027
ride round behind our position
and flank them.

783
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:02,654
We must not
divide our forces.

784
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:05,615
Do it, and let the English
see you do it.

785
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,575
They'll think
we run away.

786
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:11,579
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

787
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:12,747
Right.

788
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,375
Come on.

789
01:21:29,347 --> 01:21:31,266

Insolent bastard.

The Lord tells me
he can get me out ofthis mess,

you're fucked.

See. Every Scot with a horse
is fleeing.

811
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:47,212
Our cavalry will ride
them down like grass.

812
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:48,713
Send the horse.

01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:50,382

Does anyone know
his politics?

838
01:32:56,242 --> 01:32:58,286
No, but his weight
with the commoners

839
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,872
could unbalance
everything.

840
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:03,041

will kiss his arse,

our legitimate succession?

support the rightful--

Wait Sir William,
where are you going?

We have beaten
the English,

865
01:34:11,693 --> 01:34:13,486
but they'll come back

866
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:15,822
because you
won't stand together.

867
01:34:15,905 --> 01:34:18,158
What will you do?

868
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:20,118
I will invade England

869
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:23,329
and defeat the English
on their own ground.

870
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:27,667

That's impossible.

871
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:28,668
Why?

872
01:34:28,752 --> 01:34:30,378
Why is that impossible?

873
01:34:30,462 --> 01:34:32,464
You're so concerned
with squabbling

874
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:35,175
for the scraps
from Longshanks' table

875

to something better.

877

There's a difference
between us.

878
01:34:42,307 --> 01:34:44,267
You think the people
ofthis country exist

879
01:34:44,309 --> 01:34:46,269
to provide you
with position.

880
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:48,271
I think your
position exists

881
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:51,191
to provide those people
with freedom,

882
01:34:51,274 --> 01:34:55,904
and I go to make sure
that they have it.

883
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:09,668
Wait

884
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:14,547
I respect
what you said,

885
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:16,508
but remember
that these men

886
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:18,259
have lands
and castles.

887
01:35:18,301 --> 01:35:20,261
It's much to risk.

888

on the battlefield--

889
01:35:22,555 --> 01:35:24,015

No...

but from top to bottom,

892
01:35:31,731 --> 01:35:34,192
this country has got
no sense of itself.

allegiance with England.

war with each other.

01:35:39,072 --> 01:35:40,490
Aye.

896
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:43,159
if you make enemies
on both sides ofthe border,

897
01:35:43,243 --> 01:35:44,661
you'll end up dead.

898
01:35:44,744 --> 01:35:46,663
We all end up dead.

899
01:35:46,746 --> 01:35:48,998
It'sjust a question
of how and why.

I want
what you want,

901
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,794
but we need
the nobles.

902
01:35:52,877 --> 01:35:54,170
We need them?

903
01:35:54,254 --> 01:35:55,213
Aye.

904
01:35:55,296 --> 01:35:56,339
Nobles.

905
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:59,134
Tell me, what does that mean--
to be noble?

906
01:35:59,217 --> 01:36:00,802
Your title
gives you claim

907
01:36:00,885 --> 01:36:02,679
to the throne
ofour country,

908
01:36:02,762 --> 01:36:04,597
but men
don't follow titles,

909
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:06,182
they follow courage.

910
01:36:06,224 --> 01:36:08,268
Now, our people
know you.

911
01:36:08,351 --> 01:36:10,770
Noble and common--
they respect you,

912
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:14,607
and if you would
just lead them to freedom...

913
01:36:16,234 --> 01:36:17,652
they'd follow you.

914
01:36:19,946 --> 01:36:21,406
And so would l.

to lend,

he has not advanced.

He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

to come and face him.

Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
lrish conscripts?

01:51:35,779 --> 01:51:37,739
Even if you
dispatch them today,

1084
01:51:37,781 --> 01:51:39,574
they'd take weeks
to assemble.

1085
01:51:39,657 --> 01:51:43,953

before I sent your wife.

1086

succeeded.

my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

1091

Tell me...

1093
01:52:11,564 --> 01:52:14,359
what kind of man
is he?

1094

A mindless barbarian.

Not a king like you,

to your embroidery.

Humbly, milord.

1098
01:52:27,789 --> 01:52:31,167

01:52:37,298 --> 01:52:39,884
ofthe children
ofthis war.

1101
01:52:39,926 --> 01:52:42,345
[Laughing And Coughing]

1102
01:52:42,429 --> 01:52:44,681
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

1103
01:52:46,766 --> 01:52:48,226
Forgive me, sire.

1104
01:52:48,309 --> 01:52:49,728
I thought that generosity

1105
01:52:49,769 --> 01:52:51,229
might demonstrate
your greatness

1106
01:52:51,312 --> 01:52:54,190
to those
you mean to rule.

1107
01:52:54,232 --> 01:52:55,734
Ahem.

1108
01:52:55,817 --> 01:52:57,235
[Cough]

1109
01:52:57,277 --> 01:53:00,655
My greatness will be
better demonstrated

1110
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:03,616
when Wallace
returns to Scotland

1111
01:53:03,658 --> 01:53:06,661
and finds his country
in ashes.

1112
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:08,913
[Coughing]

1113
01:53:10,957 --> 01:53:12,167
William!

1114
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:14,169
There's riders
approaching]

1115
01:53:20,467 --> 01:53:24,679
Personal escort
ofthe princess.

1116
01:53:24,763 --> 01:53:26,222
Aye.

1117
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:29,392
Must have made
an impression.

1118
01:53:29,476 --> 01:53:30,685
Aye.

1119
01:53:30,769 --> 01:53:33,688
I didn't thinkyou were
in the tent that long.

1120
01:53:37,776 --> 01:53:39,152
Mademoiselle.

1121
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:43,448
Un message
de ma maitresse.

1122
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:45,200
Merci.

1123
01:54:09,724 --> 01:54:13,019
It's true! English ships
are moving up from the south!

1124
01:54:13,103 --> 01:54:14,562
I don't know about
the Welsh yet,

1125
01:54:14,646 --> 01:54:16,564
but the lrish
have landed!

1126
01:54:16,648 --> 01:54:19,651
I had to see it
before I could believe it.

1127
01:54:19,734 --> 01:54:21,653
Why are the lrish
fighting with the English?

1128
01:54:21,736 --> 01:54:23,780
I wouldn't worry
about them.

1129
01:54:23,863 --> 01:54:27,659
Didn't I tell you before?
It's my island.

1130
01:54:27,742 --> 01:54:29,661
Hamish, ride ahead
to Edinburgh

1131
01:54:29,744 --> 01:54:30,870
and assemble
the council.

1132
01:54:30,954 --> 01:54:31,996
Order it.

1133
01:54:32,038 --> 01:54:32,997
Aye.

1134
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:34,624
Hup!

1135
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:35,917
Hyah!

1136
01:54:37,252 --> 01:54:38,712
Your island?

1137
01:54:38,795 --> 01:54:41,840
My island! Yup!

1138
01:54:41,923 --> 01:54:43,383
You want to negotiate?

1139
01:54:43,466 --> 01:54:44,676
No, please,
gentlemen!

1140
01:54:44,718 --> 01:54:47,095
Lords,
Craig is right!

1141
01:54:47,178 --> 01:54:48,972
This time
our only option

1142
01:54:49,055 --> 01:54:51,307
is to negotiate.

1143
01:54:51,391 --> 01:54:53,852
Unless you want to see Edinburgh
razed to the ground--

1144
01:54:59,733 --> 01:55:02,193
My army has marched
for more days

1145
01:55:02,235 --> 01:55:03,445
than I can remember,

1146
01:55:03,528 --> 01:55:05,947
and we still have
preparations to make,

1147
01:55:06,031 --> 01:55:08,158
so I'll make this plain.

1148
01:55:08,199 --> 01:55:11,661
We require every soldier
you can summon--

1149
01:55:11,745 --> 01:55:14,664
your personal escorts,
even yourselves--

1150
01:55:14,706 --> 01:55:16,458
and we need them now.

1151
01:55:18,251 --> 01:55:20,170
With such a force
arrayed against us,

1152
01:55:20,253 --> 01:55:22,005
it's time to discuss
other options.

1153
01:55:22,088 --> 01:55:23,673
Other options?

1154
01:55:23,757 --> 01:55:27,177
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men

1155
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:28,678
onto the field

1156
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,181
and barter a better deal
with Longshanks

1157
01:55:31,264 --> 01:55:33,099
before you tuck tail
and run?

1158
01:55:33,183 --> 01:55:34,100
Sir William--

1159
01:55:34,184 --> 01:55:35,435
We can't defeat
this army!

1160
01:55:35,477 --> 01:55:36,644
We can!

1161
01:55:36,728 --> 01:55:38,355
And we will!

1162
01:55:40,774 --> 01:55:44,527
We won at Stirling...
and still you quibble!

1163
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:47,697
We won at York,
and you would not support us.

1164
01:55:47,781 --> 01:55:50,200
if you'll not
stand up with us now,

1165
01:55:50,283 --> 01:55:51,701
then I say
you're cowards.

1166
01:55:56,956 --> 01:55:59,668
And if you're Scotsmen,

1167
01:55:59,751 --> 01:56:02,128
I'm ashamed
to call myselfone.

1168
01:56:02,212 --> 01:56:04,798
Please, Sir William,
speak with me alone.

1169
01:56:07,717 --> 01:56:09,135
I beg you.

1170
01:56:12,222 --> 01:56:15,183
Now, you've achieved more
than anyone ever dreamed,

1171
01:56:15,225 --> 01:56:16,643
but fighting
these odds,

1172
01:56:16,726 --> 01:56:19,187
it looks like rage,
not courage.

1173
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:20,730
It's well beyond rage.

1174
01:56:22,732 --> 01:56:24,234
Help me.

1175
01:56:25,944 --> 01:56:30,156
In the name of Christ,
help yourselves!

1176
01:56:30,198 --> 01:56:32,117
Now is our chance. Now.

1177
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,494
Ifwejoin, we can win.

1178
01:56:34,536 --> 01:56:38,707
Ifwe win, we'll have
what none of us ever had before--

1179
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:40,166
a country ofour own.

1180
01:56:42,252 --> 01:56:44,379
You're the rightful leader.

1181
01:56:44,462 --> 01:56:47,257
And there is strength in you,
I see it.

1182
01:56:52,429 --> 01:56:53,430
Unite us.

1183
01:56:56,099 --> 01:56:57,600
Unite us!

1184
01:56:57,684 --> 01:56:59,477
Unite the clans.

1185
01:57:06,735 --> 01:57:08,153
All right.

1186
01:57:08,236 --> 01:57:09,654
Right.

1187
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,411
This cannot be the way.

1188
01:57:16,494 --> 01:57:18,705
You said yourself- -

1189
01:57:18,788 --> 01:57:23,168
the nobles will not
support Wallace.

1190
01:57:23,251 --> 01:57:25,170
So how did it help us

1191
01:57:25,253 --> 01:57:28,173
tojoin the side
that is slaughtered?

1192
01:57:28,256 --> 01:57:30,175
I gave him my word.

1193
01:57:38,266 --> 01:57:40,685
I know it is hard.

1194
01:57:40,727 --> 01:57:42,937
Being a leader is.

1195
01:57:44,564 --> 01:57:48,693
But, son... son...

1196
01:57:48,777 --> 01:57:50,195
Iook at me.

1197
01:57:57,452 --> 01:57:59,120
I cannot be king.

1198
01:57:59,204 --> 01:58:02,707
You and you alone
can rule Scotland.

1199
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:05,710
What I tell you,
you must do.

1200
01:58:05,794 --> 01:58:08,672
Not for me,
not foryourself,

1201
01:58:08,713 --> 01:58:10,674
foryour country.

1202
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:28,149
Eh, lads, make way.

1203
01:58:28,233 --> 01:58:30,151
Coming through here.

1204
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:38,118
Make way, lads.

1205
01:58:38,201 --> 01:58:39,661
Make--

1206
01:58:43,748 --> 01:58:46,292
The Bruce is
not coming, William.

1207
01:58:46,376 --> 01:58:48,128
He'll come.

1208
01:58:50,046 --> 01:58:52,465
Mornay and Lochlan
have come.

1209
01:58:53,967 --> 01:58:55,677
So will the Bruce.

1210
01:58:58,513 --> 01:59:03,184
Quite the lovely...
gathering.

1211
01:59:03,268 --> 01:59:05,020
Wouldn't you agree?

1212
01:59:07,981 --> 01:59:10,025
The archers
are ready, sire.

1213
01:59:10,108 --> 01:59:11,526
Not the archers.

1214
01:59:11,609 --> 01:59:15,071
My scouts tell me
their archers are miles away

1215
01:59:15,155 --> 01:59:17,073
and no threat to us.

1216
01:59:17,157 --> 01:59:19,534
Arrows cost money.
Use up the lrish.

1217
01:59:19,576 --> 01:59:20,827
The dead cost nothing.

1218
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:23,997
And send in
the infantry and cavalry.

1219
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,540
Infantry!

1220
01:59:25,582 --> 01:59:26,583
Infantry!

1221
01:59:26,624 --> 01:59:27,584
Cavalry!

1222
01:59:27,625 --> 01:59:28,710
Cavalry!

1223
01:59:28,793 --> 01:59:30,211
Cavalry!

1224
01:59:30,253 --> 01:59:31,629
Cavalry!

1225
01:59:31,713 --> 01:59:32,881
Advance!

1226
01:59:32,964 --> 01:59:35,050
Advance!

1227
02:00:58,174 --> 02:01:02,220
Ah, good to see you
this morning.

1228
02:01:03,555 --> 02:01:06,224
Irish.

1229
02:01:06,307 --> 02:01:08,727
Glad to
have you with us.

1230
02:01:08,768 --> 02:01:10,186
Watch this.

1231
02:01:49,768 --> 02:01:51,269
[Yelling]

1232
02:03:19,899 --> 02:03:22,652
Mornay? Lochlan?

1233
02:03:22,736 --> 02:03:25,572
I gave Mornay double
his lands in Scotland

1234
02:03:25,613 --> 02:03:27,657
and matching estates
in England.

1235
02:03:27,741 --> 02:03:31,161
Lochlan turned
for much less.

1236
02:03:31,244 --> 02:03:32,662
Archers.

1237
02:03:32,746 --> 02:03:34,164
I beg pardon, sire.

1238
02:03:34,247 --> 02:03:36,374
Won't we hit
our own troops?

1239
02:03:38,752 --> 02:03:40,170
Yes...

1240
02:03:40,253 --> 02:03:42,088
but we'll hit theirs
as well.

1241
02:03:42,172 --> 02:03:44,883
We have reserves.

1242
02:03:44,924 --> 02:03:46,468
Attack.

1243
02:03:48,261 --> 02:03:49,387
Archers!

1244
02:03:49,471 --> 02:03:52,390
Archers... attack!

1245
02:03:57,395 --> 02:03:58,396
Loose!

1246
02:04:05,236 --> 02:04:06,821
Loose!

1247
02:04:27,342 --> 02:04:28,760
Send in our reinforcements.

1248
02:04:28,802 --> 02:04:30,053
[Cough]

1249
02:04:30,136 --> 02:04:31,221
Send in the rest

1250
02:04:41,648 --> 02:04:44,651
Bring me Wallace.

1251
02:04:44,734 --> 02:04:46,695
Alive, if possible.

1252
02:04:46,736 --> 02:04:48,697
Dead... just as good.

1253
02:04:48,738 --> 02:04:51,324
Send us news
ofour victory.

1254
02:04:51,408 --> 02:04:53,368
Shall we retire?

1255
02:06:18,495 --> 02:06:20,080
Protect the king.

1256
02:08:23,995 --> 02:08:25,205
Get up!

1257
02:08:25,288 --> 02:08:26,790
Get up!

1258
02:08:28,166 --> 02:08:29,793
Up!

1259
02:08:29,876 --> 02:08:31,127
Get up!

1260
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:33,963
Get him out of here!

1261
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:40,387
Go!

1262
02:09:33,356 --> 02:09:36,067
[Cough]

1263
02:09:40,405 --> 02:09:41,781
I'm dying.

1264
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:47,245
Let me be.

1265
02:09:53,251 --> 02:09:55,170
No.

1266
02:09:55,253 --> 02:09:58,506
You're going to live.

1267
02:09:58,548 --> 02:10:02,302
I've lived long enough
to live free.

1268
02:10:02,385 --> 02:10:08,141
Proud to see you become
the man you are.

1269
02:10:12,687 --> 02:10:14,773
I'm a happy man.

1270
02:12:03,631 --> 02:12:06,634
I'm the one
who's rotting,

1271
02:12:06,676 --> 02:12:10,472
but I thinkyour face
looks graver than mine.

1272
02:12:15,143 --> 02:12:16,603
Son...

1273
02:12:22,150 --> 02:12:24,569
we must have alliance
with England

1274
02:12:24,652 --> 02:12:26,821
to prevail here.

1275
02:12:26,905 --> 02:12:29,115
You achieved that.

1276
02:12:29,157 --> 02:12:30,575
You saved your family,

1277
02:12:30,658 --> 02:12:33,328
increased your land.

1278
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:38,458
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1279
02:12:38,541 --> 02:12:44,756
Lands, titles,
men, power-- nothing.

1280
02:12:44,798 --> 02:12:45,965
Nothing?

1281
02:12:46,049 --> 02:12:47,634
I have nothing.

1282
02:12:49,052 --> 02:12:50,512
Men fight for me...

1283
02:12:50,553 --> 02:12:53,598
because ifthey do not,
I throw them off my land

1284
02:12:53,682 --> 02:12:57,018
and I starve their wives
and their children.

1285
02:12:57,102 --> 02:13:03,066
Those men who bled
the ground red at Falkirk...

1286
02:13:03,149 --> 02:13:05,068
they fought for
William Wallace,

1287
02:13:05,151 --> 02:13:08,863
and he fights for
something that I've never had.

1288
02:13:10,490 --> 02:13:14,411
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

1289
02:13:14,494 --> 02:13:18,456
and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield,

1290
02:13:18,498 --> 02:13:20,458
and it's tearing me apart!

1291
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:23,753
Well, all men betray,
all lose heart.

1292
02:13:23,837 --> 02:13:26,548
I don't want
to lose heart!

1293
02:13:29,676 --> 02:13:34,889
I want to believe...
as he does.

1294
02:13:40,645 --> 02:13:44,107
I will never be
on the wrong side again.

1295
02:13:51,656 --> 02:13:53,241
[Snore]

1296
02:14:33,698 --> 02:14:35,617
No!

1297
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:49,798
[Yelling]

1298
02:15:01,309 --> 02:15:02,852
There he is!
After him!

1299
02:15:31,881 --> 02:15:35,135
Lord Craig,
is it true about Mornay?

1300
02:15:35,218 --> 02:15:40,265
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

1301
02:15:40,306 --> 02:15:43,268
More a liability now
than ever he was.

1302
02:15:43,351 --> 02:15:46,563
And there's no telling
who'll be next.

1303
02:15:48,148 --> 02:15:49,691
Maybe you.

1304
02:15:51,901 --> 02:15:53,403
Maybe me.

1305
02:15:59,075 --> 02:16:00,910
It doesn't matter.

1306
02:16:02,787 --> 02:16:04,205
I'm serious, Robert.

1307
02:16:04,247 --> 02:16:05,707
So am I!

1308
02:16:19,012 --> 02:16:20,930
Christ Shit!

1309
02:16:21,014 --> 02:16:23,725
Search the place!

1310
02:16:26,561 --> 02:16:27,729
Lochlan.

1311
02:16:34,736 --> 02:16:37,572
William Wallace
killed 50 men.

1312
02:16:37,655 --> 02:16:40,075
50 if it was one.

1313
02:16:40,116 --> 02:16:41,284
1 00 men...

1314
02:16:41,368 --> 02:16:42,827
with his own sword.

1315
02:16:42,911 --> 02:16:44,704
Cut through them like...

1316
02:16:44,788 --> 02:16:47,957
Moses through
the Red Sea.

1317
02:17:20,115 --> 02:17:22,742
His legend grows.

1318
02:17:22,826 --> 02:17:25,578
It will be worse
than before.

1319
02:17:25,662 --> 02:17:28,581
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town,

1320
02:17:28,665 --> 02:17:30,583
and when he replenishes
his numbers--

1321
02:17:30,625 --> 02:17:33,086
They're sheep!
Mere sheep!

1322
02:17:33,169 --> 02:17:34,754
[Coughing]

1323
02:17:34,796 --> 02:17:38,299
Easily dispersed
if we strike the shepherd.

1324
02:17:38,383 --> 02:17:40,051
Very well.

1325
02:17:40,135 --> 02:17:43,596
Pick a flock
of your finest assassins

1326
02:17:43,638 --> 02:17:45,056
and set a meeting.

1327
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:48,435
Milord, Wallace
is renowned

1328
02:17:48,476 --> 02:17:51,062
for his ability
to smell an ambush.

1329
02:17:53,648 --> 02:17:57,485
Ifwhat Lord Hamilton tells me
is correct,

1330
02:17:57,569 --> 02:17:59,529
he warmed to
our future queen.

1331
02:17:59,571 --> 02:18:01,406
He would trust her.

1332
02:18:03,074 --> 02:18:05,326
So we'll dispatch her
with the notion

1333
02:18:05,410 --> 02:18:06,786
that she comes in peace.

1334
02:18:06,828 --> 02:18:09,622
Milord, the princess
might be taken hostage

1335
02:18:09,706 --> 02:18:12,000
or her life
be put in jeopardy.

1336
02:18:12,083 --> 02:18:15,712
Oh, my son would be
most distressed by that.

1337
02:18:15,795 --> 02:18:19,424
Uh, but in truth,
ifshe were to be killed,

1338
02:18:19,466 --> 02:18:23,303
we would soon find
the king of France

1339
02:18:23,386 --> 02:18:25,555
a useful ally
against the Scots.

1340
02:18:27,307 --> 02:18:30,518
You see, as king,

1341
02:18:30,602 --> 02:18:35,607
you must find the good
in any situation.

1342
02:19:01,716 --> 02:19:04,469
It's William Wallace, sure.

1343
02:19:04,511 --> 02:19:07,347
He's giving up his sword.

1344
02:19:07,430 --> 02:19:08,390
Be ready.

1345
02:19:31,955 --> 02:19:34,249
Aah!

1346
02:19:46,011 --> 02:19:47,554
[Screaming]

1347
02:20:24,758 --> 02:20:26,593
[Bird Call]

1348
02:20:47,155 --> 02:20:48,531
Milady...

1349
02:20:53,119 --> 02:20:55,121
I received your message.

1350
02:20:55,205 --> 02:20:56,956
Oh.

1351
02:21:08,134 --> 02:21:10,595
This is...
the second time

1352
02:21:10,637 --> 02:21:12,347
you've warned me
ofdanger.

1353
02:21:14,724 --> 02:21:16,184
Why?

1354
02:21:16,267 --> 02:21:19,104
There will be
a new shipment ofsupplies

1355
02:21:19,145 --> 02:21:22,273
coming north next month--
foods and weapons.

1356
02:21:22,315 --> 02:21:25,568
No, stop.

1357
02:21:25,652 --> 02:21:27,904
Why do you help me?

1358
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:37,122
Why do you help me?

1359
02:21:37,205 --> 02:21:41,001
Because ofthe way
you are looking at me now.

1360
02:23:04,125 --> 02:23:05,543
[Labored Breathing]

1361
02:23:32,487 --> 02:23:35,073
Just when we thought
all hope was lost,

1362
02:23:35,156 --> 02:23:38,034
our noble saviors
have arrived.

1363
02:23:40,078 --> 02:23:42,539
Off with their... hoods.

1364
02:23:47,627 --> 02:23:50,338
Sir William, we've come
to seek a meeting.

1365
02:23:50,422 --> 02:23:53,008
Well, what's the point?

1366
02:23:53,091 --> 02:23:55,385
You've all sworn loyalty
to Longshanks.

1367
02:23:55,468 --> 02:23:58,054
An oath to a liar
is no oath at all.

1368
02:23:58,138 --> 02:24:00,890
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1369
02:24:00,974 --> 02:24:03,101
So let the council
swear publicly.

1370
02:24:03,184 --> 02:24:07,063
We cannot. Some scarcely
believe you're alive.

1371
02:24:07,147 --> 02:24:09,524
Others thinkyou'll pay
them Mornay's wages.

1372
02:24:09,607 --> 02:24:11,526
So we bid you
to Edinburgh.

1373
02:24:11,568 --> 02:24:13,069
Meet us two days
from now.

1374
02:24:13,153 --> 02:24:15,572
Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1375
02:24:15,613 --> 02:24:17,073
Scotland will be one.

1376
02:24:17,115 --> 02:24:19,451
One?
You mean us and you.

1377
02:24:19,534 --> 02:24:22,287
No.

1378
02:24:22,370 --> 02:24:24,122
I mean this.

1379
02:24:26,458 --> 02:24:28,835
It's the pledge
of Robert the Bruce.

1380
02:24:38,511 --> 02:24:40,555
You do know it's a trap.
Tell him.

1381
02:24:40,597 --> 02:24:42,515
Ifthe Bruce
wanted to kill you,

1382
02:24:42,557 --> 02:24:44,059
he'd have done it
at Falkirk.

1383
02:24:44,142 --> 02:24:45,310
Aye.

1384
02:24:45,352 --> 02:24:48,104
I know. I saw.

1385
02:24:48,188 --> 02:24:50,523
Leave him aside.
What about the others?

1386
02:24:50,565 --> 02:24:52,275
Nest of scheming bastards!

1387
02:24:52,317 --> 02:24:54,527
They couldn't agree
on the color of shite!

1388
02:24:54,611 --> 02:24:56,196
It's a trap.
Are you blind?

1389
02:24:56,237 --> 02:24:58,531
Look at us.

1390
02:24:58,615 --> 02:25:00,533
We've got to try.

1391
02:25:00,617 --> 02:25:03,036
We can't do
this alone.

1392
02:25:03,078 --> 02:25:05,538
Joining the nobles
is the only hope for our people.

1393
02:25:05,622 --> 02:25:08,166
You know what happens
ifwe don't take that chance?

1394
02:25:08,249 --> 02:25:09,376
What?

1395
02:25:09,459 --> 02:25:10,543
Nothing.

1396
02:25:12,545 --> 02:25:15,048
I don't want
to be a martyr.

1397
02:25:15,131 --> 02:25:17,050
Nor l. I want to live.

1398
02:25:17,133 --> 02:25:20,053
I want a home
and children and peace.

1399
02:25:20,136 --> 02:25:21,930
Do you?

1400
02:25:21,971 --> 02:25:23,556
Aye, I do.

1401
02:25:23,598 --> 02:25:25,558
I've asked God
for those things.

1402
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,894
It's all for nothing
if you don't have freedom.

1403
02:25:27,977 --> 02:25:30,230
That'sjust
a dream, William.

1404
02:25:30,313 --> 02:25:32,065
A dream?
Just a...

1405
02:25:32,148 --> 02:25:36,027
Well, then what have we
been doing all this time?

1406
02:25:36,069 --> 02:25:37,779
We've lived that dream.

1407
02:25:37,862 --> 02:25:40,031
Your dream
isn't about freedom.

1408
02:25:40,073 --> 02:25:41,658
It's about Murron.

1409
02:25:41,741 --> 02:25:45,078
Your dream is to be a hero
'cause you think she sees you.

1410
02:25:45,161 --> 02:25:48,456
I don't think she sees me.
I know she does.

1411
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:50,417
And your father
sees you, too.

1412
02:25:52,043 --> 02:25:53,878
Ohh!

1413
02:25:56,423 --> 02:25:58,008
Ah.

1414
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:03,596
Jesus.

1415
02:26:03,596 --> 02:26:07,017
Get up.
Give us your hand.

1416
02:26:07,183 --> 02:26:09,019
[Coughs]

1417
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:10,895
Shall I come with you?

1418
02:26:13,064 --> 02:26:16,234
No. I'll go alone.

1419
02:26:16,276 --> 02:26:19,195
I'll see you after.

1420
02:26:19,279 --> 02:26:20,864
Right.

1421
02:26:25,076 --> 02:26:28,663
Sooner rather
than later, I hope.

1422
02:26:34,586 --> 02:26:35,962
He won't come.

1423
02:26:36,004 --> 02:26:37,464
He will.

1424
02:26:37,547 --> 02:26:39,466
I know he will.

1425
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:55,482
Milord,
he approaches!

1426
02:27:39,859 --> 02:27:41,861
No!

1427
02:27:46,616 --> 02:27:48,451
Stay out of it,
Robert!

1428
02:27:48,535 --> 02:27:51,830
Aah!
You lied! You lied!

1429
02:27:55,542 --> 02:27:58,837
Bruce is not to be hurt!
That's the arrangement!

1430
02:28:06,553 --> 02:28:08,096
Father!

1431
02:28:14,227 --> 02:28:17,063
You rotting bastard

1432
02:28:17,147 --> 02:28:20,483
Why? Why?

1433
02:28:24,070 --> 02:28:27,490
Longshanks
acquired Wallace.

1434
02:28:27,574 --> 02:28:29,159
So did our nobles.

1435
02:28:29,242 --> 02:28:31,995
That was the price
of your crown.

1436
02:28:32,078 --> 02:28:35,498
Die!

1437
02:28:35,582 --> 02:28:37,208
I want you to die!

1438
02:28:37,292 --> 02:28:42,088
Soon enough I'll be dead,
and you'll be king.

1439
02:28:42,172 --> 02:28:45,008
I don't want
anything from you.

1440
02:28:45,091 --> 02:28:47,552
You're not a man!

1441
02:28:47,594 --> 02:28:49,387
You're not my father.

1442
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:58,229
You're my son,
and you've always known my mind.

1443
02:28:58,271 --> 02:29:01,608
You deceived me.

1444
02:29:01,691 --> 02:29:03,610
You let yourself
be deceived.

1445
02:29:03,693 --> 02:29:08,531
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1446
02:29:11,117 --> 02:29:14,662
Thus, you know what
it means to hate.

1447
02:29:19,626 --> 02:29:22,045
Now you're ready
to be a king.

1448
02:29:22,128 --> 02:29:27,801
My hate will die...
with you.

1449
02:29:32,138 --> 02:29:34,557
William Wallace,

1450
02:29:34,641 --> 02:29:37,394
you stand in taint
of high treason.

1451
02:29:37,435 --> 02:29:39,688
Against whom?

1452
02:29:39,771 --> 02:29:42,482
Against your king.

1453
02:29:42,565 --> 02:29:44,567
Have you
anything to say?

1454
02:29:44,651 --> 02:29:49,531
Never in my whole life...

1455
02:29:49,572 --> 02:29:51,908
did I swear
allegiance to him.

1456
02:29:51,991 --> 02:29:56,329
It matters not.
He is your king.

1457
02:29:58,498 --> 02:30:02,002
Confess, and you may
receive a quick death.

1458
02:30:02,085 --> 02:30:05,672
Deny, and you must

1459

Do you confess?

1460
02:30:08,717 --> 02:30:12,554
Do you confess?

1461
02:30:18,143 --> 02:30:20,061
Then on the morrow,

1462
02:30:20,145 --> 02:30:21,813
you shall receive
your purification.

1464
02:30:33,616 --> 02:30:35,076
Your Highness.

1465
02:30:35,118 --> 02:30:36,494
I will see the prisoner.

1466
02:30:36,578 --> 02:30:38,496
We've got orders
from the king--

1467
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:40,498
The king will be
dead in a month.

1468
02:30:40,582 --> 02:30:42,000
His son
is a weakling.

1469
02:30:42,083 --> 02:30:44,002
Who do you think
will rule this kingdom?

1470
02:30:44,085 --> 02:30:45,503
Now open this door.

1471
02:30:45,587 --> 02:30:48,006
Majesty.

1472
02:30:54,137 --> 02:30:56,222
Come on, filth.
Up on your feet.

1473
02:30:56,306 --> 02:30:57,682
Stop it!

1474
02:30:57,766 --> 02:31:00,185
Leave me.

1475
02:31:00,268 --> 02:31:02,520
I said, leave me!

1476

Sir, I come
to beg you...

1478
02:31:24,125 --> 02:31:27,045
to confess all
and swear allegiance to the king

1479
02:31:27,128 --> 02:31:29,089
that he might
show you mercy.

1480
02:31:29,172 --> 02:31:31,883
Will he show mercy
to my country?

1481
02:31:31,966 --> 02:31:35,053
Mercy is
to die quickly,

1482
02:31:35,136 --> 02:31:38,014
perhaps even
live in a tower.

1483
02:31:38,056 --> 02:31:41,017
In time, who knows
what can happen...

1484
02:31:41,059 --> 02:31:43,228
if you can only live?

1485
02:31:48,066 --> 02:31:51,027
If I swear to him,

1486
02:31:51,111 --> 02:31:54,280
then all that I am
is dead already.

1487
02:32:00,578 --> 02:32:01,996
[Crying]

1488
02:32:03,581 --> 02:32:05,959
You will die.
It will be awful.

1489
02:32:06,042 --> 02:32:08,003
Every man dies.

1490
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:12,465
Not every man really lives.

1491
02:32:19,764 --> 02:32:21,516
Drink this.

1492
02:32:21,599 --> 02:32:24,060
It will dull
your pain.

1493
02:32:24,102 --> 02:32:26,896
No. It will numb
my wits.

1494
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:29,524
I must have them all.

1495
02:32:29,607 --> 02:32:31,526
For if I'm senseless,
or if I wail,

1496
02:32:31,609 --> 02:32:35,071
then Longshanks
will have broken me.

1497
02:32:35,155 --> 02:32:37,991
I can't bear the thought
of your torture.

1498
02:32:38,074 --> 02:32:39,659
Take it.

1499
02:32:44,414 --> 02:32:45,957
All right.

1500
02:33:32,921 --> 02:33:38,426
I have come to beg
for the lifeofWilliam Wallace.

You're quite taken
with him, aren't you?

1502
02:33:42,722 --> 02:33:44,599
I respect him.

1503
02:33:47,018 --> 02:33:49,270
At worst,
he was a worthy enemy.

1504
02:33:49,354 --> 02:33:51,189
Show mercy,
O thou great king,

1505
02:33:51,272 --> 02:33:53,441
and win the respect
of your own people.

1506
02:34:03,034 --> 02:34:08,623

you are incapable of mercy.

And you...

1509
02:34:20,552 --> 02:34:23,638
To you, that word is
as unfamiliar as love.

1510
02:34:23,722 --> 02:34:26,474
Before he lost
his powers ofspeech,

1511
02:34:26,516 --> 02:34:28,977
he told me his
one comfort was that

1512
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:31,312
he would live to know
Wallace was dead.

1513
02:34:50,498 --> 02:34:53,460

02:34:53,501 --> 02:34:55,920
death comes to us all.

1515
02:35:05,263 --> 02:35:08,933
But before
it comes to you,

1516
02:35:09,017 --> 02:35:11,436
know this--

1517
02:35:11,519 --> 02:35:15,440
Your blood dies with you.

1518
02:35:15,523 --> 02:35:19,444
A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.

1519
