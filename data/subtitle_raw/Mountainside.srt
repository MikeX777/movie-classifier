1
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,075
Captain.

2
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:44,044
Captain.

3
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,013
Lieutenant?

4
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,684
I'm picking up a distress signal
on a foreign frequency.

5
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,185
It sounds human.

6
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,856
Zabladowski...

7
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:59,825
Match frequency with
Lieutenant Zamora.

8
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,229
Let's get this on the
main speaker.

9
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,832
Aye, captain.

10
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,312
Ship is in need of repairs.

11
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,314
Our food supply is exhausted.

12
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,586
We've lost contact with
our headquarters.

13
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,787
If there's
anyone out there

14
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:31,624
receiving this message,
please respond.

15
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:34,225
We are in dire need
of assistance.

16
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,763
Over.

17
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:47,907
Well, for an extra terrestrial,
she most certainly speaks great
English.

18
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,475
With the amount of radio waves
being constantly transmitted
from Earth

19
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,877
into space... They easil

20
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,379
y could have been studying
our language for centuries.

21
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,381
But how could they
have gotten here?

22
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,883
If service headquarters had
dispatched them...

23
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,184
We would have been notified.

24
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,219
Plus, it's a blind
distress call.

25
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,323
Surface Headquarters
already knows we're here.

26
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:07,760
Patch me into SHQ.

27
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:09,194
I want to get to the
bottom of this.

28
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,797
(VOICE OVER) Okay we get it.

29
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,899
(VOICE OVER) Christ
this is moving way too slow.

30
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,169
(VOICE OVER) Maybe this is
where the werewolves should come
in.

31
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,675
(scream)

32
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,208
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,378
(scream)

34
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:26,914
What in the world?

35
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:31,919
(scream)

36
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,292
(scream)

37
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,832
(ROAR)

38
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,467
(VOICE OVER)
No... That seems too rushed.

39
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,235
Who am I kidding?

40
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,539
This whole scene sucks.

41
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,742
(screaming)

42
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,952
(birds chirping)

43
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,929
It is way past my bedtime.

44
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,734
(music plays over
opening credits)

45
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:26,674
(snoring)

46
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:59,640
(alarm clock beeping)

47
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,322
Writing group.

48
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,359
Give me a break.

49
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,520
Have you even started
looking for a new job yet?

50
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,088
No.

51
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,957
I could probably set you up
with something where I work.

52
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,026
You work at a school.
You're a teacher.

53
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,561
What are you gonna get me?
A teaching job?

54
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,395
I don't even have a
degree in anything.

55
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,864
You went to film school?

56
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,100
Come on. You know
that's not even a real school.

57
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,905
I could probably get you a
job as a lunchroom attendant.

58
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,538
Jesus Christ.

59
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,773
I'm not desperate.

60
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,241
I am trying to help.

61
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,911
You said it yourself as soon
as your theater goes digital,

62
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:53,512
you're going to be out of a job.

63
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,780
I'm not going to be
out of a job.

64
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,082
I'm just going to be miserable.
I'm gonna be pushing buttons.

65
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,617
You know, a monkey
could do that job.

66
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,686
Then look for something else.

67
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,521
No, there's no point.

68
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:06,191
It's only 20 hours a week, and
it gives me plenty of time to
work on my writing.

69
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,160
20 hours a week?

70
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,129
You're in your thirties now,
Felix!

71
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,763
Oh. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. I'm not in my

72
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,933
thirties. Okay? I am 30.

73
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,267
There's a difference. You've

74
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,170
been working on your
writing, since you moved out
here.

75
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,305
And you haven't done
shit with it.

76
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:19,939
I know history has never
been your strong point, sis,

77
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:24,176
but Rome wasn't built in a day.

78
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,512
That's not a good analogy. Yes,
it is.

79
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,680
Who are you talking to?

80
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:28,479
It's Felix.

81
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,381
Hi Felix!

82
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,282
Tabby says hi.

83
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,817
Hi, Tabby.

84
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,786
What are you even
working on right now?

85
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:38,157
Something totally new that I've
never told you about before.

86
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,593
Is it the one about
the werewolves?

87
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,194
No.

88
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,629
You've been writing that

89
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:47,032
fucking stupid werewolf movie
since you and Hannah broke up.

90
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:47,933
I've been writing that
fucking awesome werewolf movie
ever since

91
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,971
before Hannah and I broke up.

92
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,872
Oh my God, why?

93
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,341
You need to let the
idea marinate!

94
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:58,510
Maybe you could just join a
writers group or something.

95
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,111
How'd you know?

96
00:07:59,113 --> 00:07:59,678
I was thinking about going

97
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,247
to a writers group.

98
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,449
I didn't.

99
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,317
Well, I'm not.

100
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,653
Okay well, it could be helpful.

101
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,787
When I think of groupsl
just imagine a bunch of older,
washed up

102
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,592
has beens who never had the
chance to be

103
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:17,029
who claim to have some skill or
talent but never actually did
anything with it.

104
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,198
And all of a sudden, during
some midlife crisis or whatever

105
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,433
start questioning and
rethinking their

106
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,237
lives and start looking for an
outlet to express their inner
artist

107
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,874
or their real self and start
going to groups as a means of
validation.

108
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,542
And that's not you?

109
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:31,443
No!

110
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:31,977
I don't know... Maybe you shou

111
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,779
ld join a writer's group.

112
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,081
Look, I don't need to go
to any groups, all right?

113
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,182
I'm fine.

114
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,220
Inspiration will hit me.
I just need to be patient.

115
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,821
Felix!

116
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,155
What?!

117
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,725
Did you start "Monika"?

118
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,325
Yes! Can you pl

119
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,929
ease stop
sneaking up on me like that?

120
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:55,234
Hey, I got to go.

121
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,303
I'll see you Friday.

122
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,239
Shit!

123
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:15,788
Hey.

124
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,324
(door slams)

125
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,193
Sorry.

126
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:22,928
(sobbing) He waited

127
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,298
purposefully into the
roaring surf...

128
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,770
(door squeaks open loud)

129
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,274
Oh. I'm sorry.

130
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,678
Um... I think I have
the wrong room.

131
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,348
Ssshhhh!

132
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,518
Is this the writer's room?

133
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,121
Ssshhhh!

134
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,289
Okay.

135
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:55,329
(door squeaks closed loud)

136
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,770
Would you mind sitting down?

137
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:15,282
In a chair?!

138
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,636
(chair squeaks
embarrassingly loud)

139
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:40,875
Sorry.

140
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,410
Okay. Where was I?

141
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,213
(sobbing again)
Strangely content

142
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,483
with the knowledge
that an ungrateful world...

143
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,288
Would just have to wait
for everything else...

144
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,424
He wanted to say.

145
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,863
And that's all I've got so far.

146
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,902
Judas. Wow.

147
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:13,205
Comedy is the hardest thing
in the world to write.

148
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,508
I don't think it sounds
that bad, to be honest.

149
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,742
Yeah, it sounds
really fun.

150
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,677
I wish I had the time to
do something like that.

151
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,613
Yeah, but you understand
where I'm coming from, right?

152
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,047
I mean, these people are crazy.

153
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,216
I don't think crazy is the word
I would use.

154
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,051
Writing a bunch of really
personal stuff

155
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:30,189
and then sharing it in front of
a room full of strangers while
weeping.

156
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,157
Maybe they're just less insecure
than you are.

157
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,494
Not everyone feels the need to
write about blood and guts all
the time.

158
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:36,461
Why does everybody
say that? You obviously ha

159
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,864
ven't seen all the
movies that I've made.

160
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,199
I'm pretty sure I have.

161
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,800
You just haven't made anything.

162
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,637
Well you obviously haven't read
everything that I've written

163
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,739
because most of it
doesn't have any blood or guts.

164
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,042
I just don't share it
with every Tom, Dick and Jane.

165
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,843
These onions are killing me.

166
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,546
I think you need a girlfriend.

167
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,881
Why would you say that? What
does that have to do with
anything?

168
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,217
It's just you're so
anxious all the time.

169
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,018
I feel like it would help
chill you out a bit.

170
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,422
Well, I don't want a girlfriend,
so I think it'd be
counterproductive.

171
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:06,892
I think you should meet
my friend Emma.

172
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,060
Oh, yeah.

173
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:09,828
She's super cute.

174
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,431
She's gorgeous and
she's really nice.

175
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,667
And she just moved here,
so she barely knows anybody.

176
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:15,867
Great, so she'll
probably like me

177
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,137
since she has no basis
for comparison.

178
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:18,770
We could double date.

179
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,839
Oh, that could be fun.

180
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,343
Thanks, Tabby, but I already
dated your sister and that ended
terribly.

181
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,245
I think I'll stay away
from your friends.

182
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,013
You've got to get over that.

183
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:28,847
I am over it.

184
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:29,682
I'm way over it.

185
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:30,717
Obviously not.

186
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,985
Would you grab me some eggplant?

187
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,853
Look, just because I don't
want to get involved

188
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,156
with someone doesn't mean Hannah
has anything to do with it.

189
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,425
Oh, you're hilarious.

190
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,393
I wouldn't say I'm hilarious
but I've always thought I ha

191
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:44,062
d a pretty good sense
of comedic timing.

192
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,632
It's been, what, five years?

193
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,666
Almost six. Feli

194
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:49,602
x I don't know
if this is helpful or not, but

195
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,070
my sister is very much over you.

196
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,171
First of all, Tabby. Your
sister was over me long before

197
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,141
we even broke up, so that's not
news.

198
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,010
Secondly, I don't care.

199
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,512
I'm not in love with your
sister anymore.

200
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,146
Okay? So it's not a thing.

201
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,717
I just have no desire to be
in a relationship right now.

202
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,985
You don't have to get into
a relationship, man.

203
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,353
Just date.

204
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,888
What's the point? That
seems pointless.

205
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,625
I dated a bunch of people before
I ended up with your sister.

206
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:15,595
Just casual hookups. Sex here,
sex there.

207
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:17,095
Gross, babe, come on.

208
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:17,996
See that's not me, you know.

209
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,532
I know myself.

210
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:23,235
You know, if I actually
end up meeting someone that I
really like

211
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,772
I'm gonna want to do it to
the max, I'm going to go 100%.

212
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:26,204
Great.

213
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,806
No, that's not great.

214
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,708
I don't want that.

215
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,642
Why not?

216
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:32,344
Because I won't do anything,
and I'll become

217
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,213
just as unproductive as I
was before I moved out here.

218
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,549
I need my time. It baf

219
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:39,786
fles me how immature
you are about relationships.

220
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:41,788
Honestly, it's like
talking to a sixth grader.

221
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,756
Of course you'd say that
you're a middle school teacher.

222
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,157
That's right, I am.

223
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,360
And I have to listen to this
kind of nonsense on a daily
basis.

224
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,630
But coming from kids,
less than half your age.

225
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,998
Well if that's the case,
then that's a perfect example

226
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,601
of why it would be totally
unfair for me to put anybody
else through this.

227
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:56,538
Through what?

228
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,969
This!

229
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,171
Yeah, point made. Look, I appr

230
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,973
eciate that you guys are
trying to be my wing wo-men.

231
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,175
I do.

232
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,546
But I really just want to
be a single guy

233
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:07,615
right now.

234
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,085
Really.

235
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:13,218
Explosive dynamite

236
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,255
expressions, dancing in
succession over and over again.

237
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:21,862
Get lost when she opens her lips
like a reverse eclipse and drops
knowledge.

238
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,764
And that's when the drums
are going to kick in

239
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:27,667
and the guitar gets all huge and
distorted, and then I'm like...

240
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,368
"Knowledge..."

241
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,706
"Knowledge, knowledge,
knowledge, knowledge. Wow."

242
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,874
And then the little breakdown
happens and the second verse
kicks in.

243
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,645
But I haven't written that yet.

244
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,113
All right.

245
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,050
Well, thank you, Elijah.

246
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:45,651
Oh, also...

247
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:46,819
Just wanna let you
knowtomorrow night

248
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:49,354
my band's going to play a
house show in a mansion.

249
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:52,059
So if you're into cool crap,
you should come.

250
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,893
Felix, buddy.

251
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,063
I'm looking at you.

252
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,565
What? I'm sorry. What?

253
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:00,899
Come on. These guys won't
come to my shows.

254
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,100
They're all a bunch of squares.

255
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:02,936
It's true.

256
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:05,971
Uh, yeah.

257
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,840
Yeah. What's the name
of your band?

258
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,241
"Sunken Pleasure."

259
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,078
We're a one piece.

260
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:15,449
One piece band.

261
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,152
Uh cool, yeah um

262
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:21,019
I'll... I'll...

263
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,489
Totally. I'll
check it out.

264
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:24,224
Dope.

265
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,693
Very dope.

266
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:37,104
(ambient music and
party chatter)

267
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,523
This is NOT a mansion.

268
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,198
Oh, hey, Elijah.

269
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,965
Oh, Felix. Dude.
Hey, I didn

270
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,401
't think you were going to come.

271
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,804
Yeah, I thought you
said this was a mansion.

272
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,806
Dude, I know, right? This
place is huge.

273
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,141
What'd you think about the set?
Did you love it?

274
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,978
Oh, shit.

275
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,111
I just got here.

276
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,480
Yeah. Hey, no worries.

277
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,783
You at least want to stick
around for a bit?

278
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:26,184
I don't know. You know,
I don't know anybody here.

279
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,085
I'll introduce you.

280
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,155
I know a ton
of these cats.

281
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,559
Sure, yeah,
whatever. Okay.

282
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,225
There you are

283
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,760
Mr. Solo Artist.

284
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:35,994
What's your band called again?

285
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:36,796
"Sunken...?"

286
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:37,765
"Sunken Pleasure."

287
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,332
That's so funny.

288
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,233
What's up, dawg?!

289
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,367
Oh, damn, dude.

290
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,268
Hey, what's up, bro?

291
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,504
Killer fucking set, dude.

292
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,672
Dude, killer fucking stache.

293
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:50,075
Dude, you were so funking
gross tonight.

294
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:50,676
Thanks!

295
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:51,511
Did you break your hig

296
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,613
h E string
during that last song?

297
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:56,949
No it was actually my low E, but
I had it tuned like my high E.

298
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:57,950
Baller!

299
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,587
Very baller.

300
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,057
What kind of dog is he?

301
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,227
He's a rescue.

302
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,803
Can I get two
beers please?

303
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,614
Thank you.

304
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,594
Excuse me.

305
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,296
Oh, sorry.

306
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,846
Double fisting, huh?

307
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:02,113
Oh, uh...

308
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:05,283
No. Uh...

309
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:10,625
That one's my friend's. I'm just
holding it for him. Not double
fisting.

310
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,629
You know, I was told
this party was in a mansion.

311
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,865
This is not a mansion.

312
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:23,103
Yeah, I was told the same thing.

313
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:27,138
It's very underwhelming.

314
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,042
You think maybe there's a
secret room or a trap door?

315
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,844
Or like a rotating bookshelf?

316
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:34,780
Hey, you ever see this movie,
um...

317
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,082
- Black Sunday!
- Haunted Honeymoon!

318
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,215
Oh, wait, which one?

319
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,383
Which one did you say?

320
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,619
Black Sunday.

321
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,888
Oh, it's this old Italian film

322
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,259
that feels like a universal
horror film, but way more bad
ass.

323
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:53,164
It's full of trapdoors and a
revolving fireplace that leads
to a crypt.

324
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,736
And there's this guy with
a Prince Valiant haircut.

325
00:18:56,738 --> 00:19:00,973
He's got, like, a
handlebar mustache.

326
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,376
It's great.

327
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,648
You watch many movies?

328
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,918
Uh, I do.

329
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,351
What kind are you into?

330
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,988
I'm pretty all over the board.

331
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,957
What filmmakers do you like?

332
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,858
I don't know. I feel like

333
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,028
I'm going to say
someone totally obscure

334
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,329
and I'm just going to embarrass
myself. So...

335
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,765
Better safe than sorry.

336
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,467
Got it.

337
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,335
I don't know... Spike Lee.

338
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,469
I like his movies a lot.

339
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,271
He's someone people know.

340
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,207
He did "Girl 6."

341
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:36,842
Uh, yeah.

342
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,309
Yeah, he did.

343
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,981
That's not the one that most
people know him from, but yeah

344
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:43,582
he did "Girl 6."

345
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,151
I like that shot at the end
with all the telephones

346
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:47,354
falling from the sky.

347
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:50,455
Yeah, it's good.

348
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,558
You ever watch any David Lynch?

349
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,259
Are you kidding me?

350
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,428
Eraserhead is like, one of
my favorite movies of all time.

351
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,463
Oh, fuck that baby though.

352
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,032
Yeah, fuck that baby.

353
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:04,369
That screechy little whine
that turns into a raspy laugh.

354
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,504
Oh it's so creepy.

355
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,106
You know, one of the first short

356
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:09,975
films I ever made was, like,
basically a rip off of
Eraserhead.

357
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,979
Oh, was it called Pencil Head?

358
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,915
Yeah, it was.

359
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:16,281
Yeah. I've never been
very clever with m

360
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,351
y titles.

361
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:22,555
So you're a filmmaker?

362
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:26,158
I haven't made anything
in a really long time, so

363
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,128
I don't think I can really
call myself a filmmaker.

364
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,396
But you have made films.

365
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:37,103
Yeah, but I mean, you know, like
most of them were real short,
little like video.

366
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:40,440
I think it's okay for you to
call yourself a filmmaker.

367
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:45,947
Thanks.

368
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:55,656
("Hey Suzzanne" by Posse
begins playing)

369
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,326
I think I'm gonna get
another beer.

370
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,929
You know,

371
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,330
you can have this one.

372
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:42,069
It's okay, I don't want to
drink your friend's beer.

373
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,336
No. I uh...
You were right.

374
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,907
I'm totally
double fisting.

375
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,008
Seriously?

376
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,376
Yeah, you nailed it.

377
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,813
But seriously, I have not
even taken a...

378
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:56,816
Well, I took one drink, but

379
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:59,018
I don't know
if I should trust you, man.

380
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,288
I mean, we just met,
and you already lied to me once

381
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,488
about fisting.

382
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,457
(spits beer)

383
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:07,862
Shit.

384
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,098
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,635
That's embarrassing.

386
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:20,074
You want to go outside?

387
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,811
Yeah.

388
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:31,951
(werewolf roars)

389
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:32,585
What in the...

390
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:33,786
(Zamora screams)

391
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:35,523
Whoa!

392
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,657
That sounds so cool.

393
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,726
I can't tell if you're
being sarcastic.

394
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:42,695
No, I really mean it.

395
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:46,497
It sounds like "Barbarella"
meets "The Howling..."

396
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,365
Yes, yes.

397
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,136
That's exactly...

398
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:51,136
Yeah, that's...

399
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:51,937
That's it. This is

400
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,305
something you've
already written?

401
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:54,407
Well, no, I

402
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:56,374
I've already
writtenlike the first

403
00:22:56,376 --> 00:23:00,478
15 pages,
but I have a ton of notes.

404
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,015
You know, like I said, I've
been working on this for years.

405
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,851
First, I wanted it
to be a disco musical porno, but

406
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,923
I scrapped that early on to
focus on the erotic horror sci
fi elements.

407
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,658
You should just write it.

408
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,128
I'd watch that movie.

409
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,328
Cool.

410
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,897
Thank you.

411
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:19,231
Unfortunately it's...
It's really hard to writ

412
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,601
e, because, you know, I don't
know the first thing about.

413
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:27,206
One: Science. Two: The future.

414
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,876
Or Three: Werewolf women
from outer space.

415
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:33,180
That's your title right there.

416
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:38,217
I've gotta
write that down.

417
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:41,088
That's amazing.

418
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,528
I don't think you're
creatively stunted.

419
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,199
It seems like maybe you just
need to trust yourself more.

420
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,234
Trust your ideas.

421
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,636
But I can relate.

422
00:23:57,638 --> 00:24:01,439
If I don't finish writing
something all in one sitting, I
typically never get

423
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,209
back to it.

424
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,444
I lose interest.

425
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,648
I'm an English major,
but I kind of hate writing.

426
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,983
That's pretty funny.

427
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,685
I like collaging a lot though.

428
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:14,887
Have you ever heard
of Grete Stern?

429
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,355
Mm-mm.

430
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:18,456
She's probably
one of my greatest influences.

431
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,161
The way that she was able
to visually interpret dreams

432
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:24,131
is like nobody else I've
ever come across.

433
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,532
You should look her up.

434
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,135
I think you'd like her.

435
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,602
I will.

436
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:33,140
I used to have the most
bizarre dreams as a kid.

437
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:38,911
And I always wished there was a
way to re-access them in the
real world.

438
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:41,313
I think that's why I
like film so much.

439
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:46,085
I feel like it's the closest
we've ever come to making that a
reality.

440
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,255
That is so cool.

441
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,233
I don't know your name.

442
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,534
Oh, yeah.

443
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,203
It's Felix.

444
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:07,239
You know, like the cat
from the old cartoon.

445
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,708
It was my mom's favorite show
when she was a kid.

446
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,943
You know those...

447
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,845
You know those clocks,
they're like that...

448
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:15,216
That big black cat with
the big wide eyes

449
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,617
that go like this.

450
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,285
And they've got that
swingy tail.

451
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:21,286
We've got one of those
in our house.

452
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,022
Yeah, that's... Th

453
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:27,026
at's well, that's not exactly
Felix, but that's basically
Felix the cat.

454
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:29,928
So you were named after a clock.

455
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,566
Yeah. I was named after a clock,
yeah.

456
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,035
What about you?

457
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,837
Was I also named after a clock?

458
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,572
Not that I know of.

459
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,943
Very funny.

460
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:45,512
It's Stella.

461
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:46,979
Your name's Stella?

462
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:48,781
Mm hmm.

463
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:51,050
That's an excellent name.

464
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:53,085
Thank you.

465
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,088
My dad's really into
campy sci fi movies.

466
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,625
Campy sci fi movies
like "Star Crash"?

467
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,894
Shut the fuck up. Are
you kidding me?

468
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,228
Holy shit. You were n

469
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,297
amed after the girl
from "Star Crash"?!

470
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,034
Most people think it's "A
Streetcar Named Desire"

471
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,069
but nope.

472
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:11,336
Unbelievable.

473
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:14,573
I can't believe
you've actually seen that movie.

474
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,374
What can I say? I love

475
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:19,346
my Italian "Star Wars" rip-offs.

476
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,349
Wow.

477
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,258
You going to smoke that?

478
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,228
Oh, uh...

479
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:36,630
Yeah.

480
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:38,032
Yeah.

481
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,841
(coughs uncontrollably)

482
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,608
Sorry.

483
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,311
Well, it was nice meeting you,
Felix.

484
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:54,480
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
You're leaving?

485
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:56,014
Yeah.

486
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:59,218
Saturdays are my Mondays.

487
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,786
Bummer.

488
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:02,921
But I hope you have
a good rest of your night.

489
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,923
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too.

490
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,226
Or thank you. You too.

491
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,661
Do you want me to walk you
out or something?

492
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:10,664
No, it's fine.

493
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:12,931
Have a good one.

494
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:13,732
Yeah. No. Yeah, I'll

495
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,134
I'll um

496
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:17,769
I'll see you

497
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,773
later.

498
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:30,885
"I'll see you later?"

499
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:44,431
(alarm beeping)

500
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,437
(groans)

501
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,315
That's depressing.

502
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,713
Oh!

503
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:21,996
(alarm beeping)

504
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:32,540
(lo-fi hiphop beat plays)

505
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:42,916
(music stops)

506
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,554
"Just put it on my bill."

507
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:52,491
I'm sorry. That is not...
all you did...

508
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:55,762
Was read a joke, eat a Popsicle,
and then read

509
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:57,863
an answer that was already
written on the stick.

510
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,131
- Well...
- I feel like I'm going crazy.

511
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,567
Am I going crazy?

512
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:06,574
I thought this was a writer's
group, not a goddamn Popsicle
reading group.

513
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:08,907
Shit.

514
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,044
(mirror crashes on the ground)

515
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,350
It's a homemade Popsicle.

516
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:24,557
Hey, Felix!

517
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,126
Oh my God, Jesus Christ!

518
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:29,029
Are you reading while walking?

519
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,999
Yeah. Is that weird?

520
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,435
Nah dude, it's dope. I mean,
I can't do that.

521
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:38,606
I'd probably get carsick
and puke on myself or something.

522
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:41,206
Cool.

523
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,074
Where are you going?

524
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:42,843
You need a ride?

525
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,944
Uh, no, no, I'm just...

526
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:48,548
My house is just like, right
up the street, so I'm good.

527
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,751
Well, we're going that
exact direction.

528
00:30:51,753 --> 00:30:57,222
Nah nah I appreciate it, but
uh... I'm right at this part
where this guy...

529
00:30:57,224 --> 00:31:00,892
He cooks his own head and tries
to feed it to his pet snake.

530
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:03,230
(off screen) Hi, Felix.

531
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,000
Stella.

532
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:11,403
Whoa. Small world.

533
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,238
Dude you two know each other?

534
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,040
- We met at the party.
- We met at the party.

535
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:18,143
How's the werewolf movie coming?

536
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:18,977
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

537
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,078
Werewolf movie?

538
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,280
Is that what you've
secretly been working on?

539
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,717
Dude, Felix hasn't shared
anything with the class yet.

540
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,855
It's... not... ready.

541
00:31:28,857 --> 00:31:30,523
How long have you guys been
seeing each other?

542
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:34,025
- Oh, God, gross. No. - Elijah
is my roommate's boyfriend.

543
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,762
Hey, watch the 'B' word.

544
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:38,698
Sorry. Elijah is my
roommate's sex friend.

545
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,364
Thank you. We carpool
sometimes because I work

546
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:42,668
just a couple blocks away.

547
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,935
Oh, where do you work?

548
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:45,170
The little bookstore
on the hill.

549
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:46,940
The one with all the cat puke
stains on the carpet.

550
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:50,308
Oh, yeah. I love that place.

551
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,280
It's got a really loud fan
in the bathroom.

552
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:58,686
Are you sure you don't
want to ride?

553
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:04,124
Come on.

554
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,191
What the heck?

555
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:07,595
There you go!

556
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:17,938
You can pull over right here.

557
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,140
Which house is yours?

558
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:25,878
Uh, I live like a block up
the road actually.

559
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,748
I just don't want you to see
where I live because I'm
embarrassed of it.

560
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,649
Really?

561
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:30,482
Maybe. Or maybe you're

562
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:33,351
afraid I'm going to stalk you.

563
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,387
My house... It looks
like garbage.

564
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,789
It looks like
a frat house.

565
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,659
Ooo, "Frat Boy Felix."

566
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:41,359
(off screen) How many
people do you live with?

567
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,061
Honestly, I have no idea.

568
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:45,430
Sometimes I go weeks
without seeing anybody

569
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,700
and then all of a sudden, it's
like every time I walk in the
front door

570
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:49,369
there's a new roommate.

571
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,643
Hey, whose copy of "Cannibal
Holocaust" is this?

572
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,376
Have you seen it?

573
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:01,079
No, but I really want to.

574
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:01,683
You should borrow it.

575
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:03,616
Yeah?

576
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,016
Yeah. Th

577
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:08,286
ere's not a lot of people
that I would recommend it to

578
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:12,324
but it seems like you and I have
a pretty similar taste in
movies.

579
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,861
You might hate it, but you
should definitely watch it.

580
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:18,063
The score alone
is amazing.

581
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,232
It's also really
fucked up.

582
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:21,166
No, I'm serious.

583
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,635
Like I watch a lot of weird shit

584
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:26,004
and I mean a lot of weird shit,
but even I can't handle it.

585
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,474
So good luck, dude.

586
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,610
Well, all right.

587
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:31,677
Thank you.

588
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,345
And thanks for the ride,
by the way.

589
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,517
Mi Carsa su Carsa.

590
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,018
All right.

591
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:48,360
So I guess I'll see you
whenever the next group meets.

592
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,361
Shit yeah you will.

593
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:53,735
And uh... I
will see you...

594
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,805
Later.

595
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:00,542
Yeah.

596
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,343
Uh, okay.

597
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,814
See ya.

598
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,181
Oh hey, Felix!

599
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:12,050
Yeah?

600
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,187
Got to find out what
happens with that snake, dude.

601
00:34:14,923 --> 00:34:15,590
Right.

602
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:17,825
Thanks.

603
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,831
Uh... Stella?

604
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:26,197
Do you...

605
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,301
Would you...

606
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,636
Want to hang out sometime?

607
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,873
We could go see a movie,
or uh...

608
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:38,076
You know, maybe do a bunch of
silly touristy stuff around
town...

609
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:38,711
Or...

610
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:39,614
Or not.

611
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:41,146
We can do something...

612
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:42,115
Something else.

613
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,952
Let's do all of those things.

614
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,753
Oh, okay.

615
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,590
Cool. Uh, yeah. Okay.

616
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:56,394
Uh, should I just get
your number from Elijah?

617
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:58,531
Uh, do you have
something to write on?

618
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,297
Uh, yeah.

619
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,601
Yes, yes I do.

620
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,670
Uh...

621
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:05,640
Let's see.

622
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:11,478
Do you have something
to write with?

623
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,881
Uh...

624
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,616
Uh... no.

625
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:18,452
No worries. I got you, dude.

626
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,821
Thanks.

627
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:30,663
What is thisbizarre cell
phone world we live in wher

628
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:34,499
e numbers like this actually
exist?

629
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:36,902
I know, it's the future.

630
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:38,403
It's a real weird future.

631
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:40,072
A weal weiwd futuwe.

632
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,542
A weal weal weiwd futuwe!

633
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,511
(laughs)

634
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:49,316
Okay, I'll see you.

635
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:51,517
Hey, Felix?

636
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,152
Yeah!

637
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,987
Just so you know... And maybe

638
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,824
I don't even need to say this,
but I just want to be really
clear.

639
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,927
I'm not looking for anything
more than a friend.

640
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:02,930
Right now.

641
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,737
Yeah, that...

642
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:14,006
That's... great.

643
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,173
That's awesome.

644
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,108
Yeah?

645
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,576
Yeah!

646
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:20,412
You have no idea how perfect
that is actually.

647
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:21,949
Okay, good.

648
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:24,852
Okay.

649
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:27,218
Okay.

650
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,453
I am going to call you though.

651
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:29,889
We are going to hang out.

652
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:30,589
We better.

653
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:31,959
I want my movie back.

654
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:34,595
Fair enough.

655
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:36,729
Bye, Felix.

656
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:37,732
Later, dude.

657
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:39,600
See ya.

658
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:00,152
"I'll see you later?"

659
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:01,721
Jesus.

660
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:08,663
(blood-curdling screams
come from the TV)

661
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:11,557
Your directions were perfect.

662
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,659
Step outside. Take a left.

663
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:15,393
Go straight. I was goin

664
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:19,999
g to mention how close I lived
when I dropped you off the other
day, but

665
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:21,133
I decided not to.

666
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:23,803
Yeah, just in case I
was actually a stalker.

667
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:24,537
Mm-hmm.

668
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:26,205
Smart move.

669
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:27,640
I really like your place.

670
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:28,339
Thanks. Sorry if I

671
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,242
t smells weird in here.

672
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:33,380
I mean, it just smells like a
mix of catnip and marijuana.

673
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:34,680
(meows)

674
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:36,314
Oh, there's the culprit.

675
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,717
Yeah, she's a real big pothead.

676
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,688
(off screen)
Is somebody talking about me?

677
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:43,522
Hi, I'm Gina.

678
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,558
That's my roommate.

679
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,059
Hey, I'm Felix.

680
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:49,460
Nice to finally meet you.

681
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,864
Um... It's nice to meet you too.

682
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:54,166
Want to take a quick bong rip?

683
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:56,334
Uh no thanks. I will probably

684
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,839
just end up hearing things, and
then I'll get really judgmental.

685
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,674
You guys are a bunch of squares.

686
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:06,011
Just because a square's a
rectangle, Gina, doesn't mean a
rectangle's a square.

687
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,180
I am way too stone for
this conversation.

688
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,516
It's actually starting
to make sense to me.

689
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:12,551
It was nice meeting you, Felix.

690
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:13,552
Likewise.

691
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:16,454
Have fun.

692
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:19,060
We grew up together.

693
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:26,966
You have a TV in your fireplace.

694
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,133
That's really cool.

695
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:30,336
So what did you think
of "Cannibal Holocaust"?

696
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:33,438
I mean it was definitely
intense, but you were right.

697
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,308
I mean, that music was amazing.

698
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,877
And it's crazy too how relevant

699
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,879
this movie is
to right now.

700
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:41,947
Like the power of media
and reality TV?

701
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:44,516
Yeah. And it was
made in what...?

702
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:45,753
1980.

703
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,288
That blows my mind.

704
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,090
It's a pretty smart movie.

705
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:52,793
Horrible. But very smart.

706
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:54,795
Yeah.

707
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:58,165
Wow.

708
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:01,602
These aren't...

709
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,536
Are these your collages?

710
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,938
Yeah.

711
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,909
The one with the horse in
the desert is actually a dream I
had.

712
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:13,881
Man, I love the mix of your
own drawings with the cut-outs.

713
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,449
You're really good at drawing.

714
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,384
Thanks.

715
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:20,121
Do you have any more of these?

716
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,321
Mm-hm.

717
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:24,992
Can I see some of them?

718
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:28,827
Okay.

719
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,796
We should get going, yeah?

720
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:32,430
I've just gotta feed
Barfzone real quick

721
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,532
and then I'm ready.

722
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,234
Barfzone?

723
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:38,471
You know, our stoner cat.

724
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:45,680
Amazing.

725
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:55,089
(French pop song plays
over montage)

726
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:24,583
Oh my God!

727
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,020
Sorry.

728
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,189
Sorry.

729
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,692
Haha that's you!

730
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:08,195
Jesus Christ, again?!

731
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,097
(off screen)
Drink it all up, "Movie Boy."

732
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:17,669
Ugh! I am so tired of all
my sister's dumb-ass drama.

733
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:19,538
Not in front of the kid, babe.

734
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,073
No no, please.

735
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:23,409
I love it when you talk
shit about your sister.

736
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:25,611
Makes me feel less crazy.

737
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,579
It's nothing. It's just annoying

738
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:29,214
relationship stuff
involving the dude

739
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:31,483
she's been seeing. Stuff
I'm sure you don't want to hear.

740
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:33,652
She's back in the dudes again?

741
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:34,620
Classic.

742
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:37,189
Well, she was, but not anymore.

743
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:40,092
Now she's hooking up
with the dude's ex-girlfriend.

744
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:41,929
The one that they just had
a threesome with last week.

745
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,729
You're right.

746
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,831
Totally stuff I don't
want to hear.

747
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,199
Is it my turn?

748
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,102
Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

749
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,039
(Felix's phone buzzes)

750
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:55,007
(off screen) Y'all really gotta
work on your aim because

751
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:57,344
(off screen) I think I've
actually started sobering up
since we started playing.

752
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:01,814
You know, I'm sorry guys.
I gotta go.

753
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:02,714
I totally spaced

754
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:05,451
I made plans with someone.

755
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:08,687
Yeah. You have plans with us.

756
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:11,223
No, I made plans with
someone else.

757
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:13,492
Invite them over. We have
plenty of beer.

758
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:19,131
We are already going to be doing
something totally different.

759
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:21,235
Felix, are you seeing someone?

760
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:23,536
No, no, no.

761
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:24,703
She's just my friend...

762
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:25,737
Aha! "She!"

763
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,739
No, no "Aha."

764
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:29,509
She's just...

765
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:30,776
We're best buds.

766
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:33,145
I'm your sister.
We're best buds.

767
00:43:33,147 --> 00:43:35,080
And we never see you anymore.

768
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:36,516
What are you talking
about? I'm here right now.

769
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:38,016
You're over significantly

770
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:39,118
less often than usual.

771
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,386
And we're your only friends.

772
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:42,688
That's not true.

773
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,722
You're not my only...

774
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:44,289
And you're about to leave!

775
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,090
So? So it's like you

776
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:47,527
aren't even here right now.

777
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:48,595
This is ridiculous. I thou

778
00:43:48,597 --> 00:43:50,729
ght you said you don't
want to be seeing anybody.

779
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:51,564
Yeah. I

780
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:51,864
don't. And I'm not seeing an

781
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:54,333
ybody right now.

782
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:55,134
You know what?

783
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,001
Forget it.

784
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:57,469
Invite her over.
I want to meet her.

785
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,205
Yeah, me too.

786
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,039
You know what? I'm
hopping your fence

787
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,978
and I'm running away.

788
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,149
(Felix's VOICE OVER) Once, when
I was about five years old...

789
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:11,250
Unbelievable. (Felix's
VOICE OVER) My sister Ilana

790
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:15,287
was babysitting me while
our mom was at work.

791
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:18,190
At one point, she eventually
realized I was nowhere to be
seen

792
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:20,728
and got up to go look for me.

793
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:27,701
(low foreboding ambience)

794
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:40,179
(Felix's VOICE OVER) The roar of
the hot water-heater filled the
damp air...

795
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:42,781
Reverberating louder and louder

796
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:46,586
through the cracked cement walls
and floors of what might as well

797
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:50,457
have been a set from
"A Nightmare on Elm Street."

798
00:44:52,126 --> 00:44:54,226
Room after room, she checked,

799
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:57,198
and I was still
nowhere to be found.

800
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,179
(Felix's VOICE OVER) When my
sister finally turned the last
corner

801
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:16,016
in the furthest reaches of
the basement...

802
00:45:17,686 --> 00:45:22,522
There I was. Five year old
Felix, sitting in the cat-litter
box...

803
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:27,761
Turd in my hand, turd in my
mouth, just devouring cat poop.

804
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:30,462
She said it looked like I was

805
00:45:30,464 --> 00:45:33,367
stuffing my face with
Almond Roca.

806
00:45:34,235 --> 00:45:37,836
To this day, I love Almond Roca.

807
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:40,806
Oh, that's so disgusting.

808
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:44,912
And to think I'm sharing this
bottle of wine with you. Ugh!

809
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,115
Mmmm.

810
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,284
Ahhh!

811
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:52,652
All right.

812
00:45:52,654 --> 00:45:54,520
Your turn. Truth or dare?

813
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:55,487
Truth.

814
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,289
Tell me more about this
dad of yours.

815
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:59,927
All I know is he was really
into campy sci fi movies.

816
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:02,961
Well...

817
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:06,231
As long as I've been alive,
my dad, or Bob

818
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:08,934
as he's commonly referred to...

819
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,536
Has been a dentist.

820
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:13,073
I used to be embarrassed to tell
people who is a tooth doctor.

821
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,310
So instead I told them
he was a government spy.

822
00:46:17,244 --> 00:46:20,180
(intense action music plays)

823
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:30,491
All I really know about my mom
is that she used to be a writer.

824
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:32,625
She published this New-Ag

825
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:35,861
ey self-help
book thing right before her

826
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:41,867
and my dad got divorced, called
"Polygamy: The New Monogamy."

827
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:44,803
According to my oldest brother,
she's somewhere in Utah now.

828
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:47,072
Living in a Bus Commune.

829
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,273
Bus Commune? Yeah, just
like a big piece of

830
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:52,477
land with a bunch of old,
decommissioned busses

831
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,812
parked there.

832
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,483
Maybe, I don't know.

833
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,787
What are you thinking?

834
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:01,621
You thinkin' my family

835
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:03,589
sounds crazy now, huh?

836
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:06,827
I was thinking about your mom's
book. "The New Monogamy."

837
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,898
It's pretty interesting.

838
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:16,571
When was the last time you uh...

839
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:19,373
Well, you know.

840
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:21,375
What?

841
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:23,611
You know...

842
00:47:25,814 --> 00:47:27,079
Stella!

843
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:30,215
Oh you don't have to say
if you don't want to.

844
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:33,987
You sure you want to open
that can of worms?

845
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:40,025
Uh... it's been a while.

846
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,527
I mean, the last
relationship I was in

847
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:43,830
was with Hannah, and
that was like five years ago.

848
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:47,199
There's no way you
haven't had sex in five years.

849
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,967
No, I mean I have.

850
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,302
I have.

851
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:54,640
But it's just not,
you know, good sex. Or fun sex.

852
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:58,946
It's sex that I don't even
care about or remember half the
time.

853
00:47:59,814 --> 00:48:02,047
Mostly I just feel bad about it.

854
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,649
Oh no! What?

855
00:48:03,651 --> 00:48:04,586
(laughs)

856
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:06,952
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

857
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:08,855
I'm sorry I'm laughing.

858
00:48:08,857 --> 00:48:11,390
Why do you feel bad about it?

859
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:14,159
I don't know, lots of reasons.

860
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:17,195
First of all, it's
usually an accident.

861
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:19,965
Like, you know,
me and so-and-so are making out

862
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,670
and she starts putting out sex
vibes, and you know, I'm so go
with the flow

863
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:28,006
I just... go
with the flow.

864
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:32,879
And then suddenly I realize
partway through it that I've
been inside my head

865
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:37,315
the whole time, just wishing I
was somewhere else, far far
away.

866
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:39,418
Well that's terrible.

867
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,689
Other times I just pass out.

868
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:44,692
What do you mean?

869
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:48,694
I just pass out.

870
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:51,129
Like during sex?

871
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,665
Yeah, during sex.

872
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,867
I have even passed out
in the middle of...

873
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:58,738
In the middle of what?!

874
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,038
Going down on the person.

875
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,541
No way!

876
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:01,908
Mu.

877
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,710
Itiple times.

878
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:06,879
I don't even know how
that can happen!

879
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,146
It's pretty embarrassing.

880
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:11,950
I mean when I am in the moment,
I am in the moment.

881
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:13,952
I am relaxed.

882
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:15,788
I am focused.

883
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,727
Yeah, see I think the
problem for me is I'm just not
into casual sex.

884
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:23,195
I'm not against it.

885
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:25,199
I'm just not interested.

886
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:30,570
Well, that's the opposite of
what most guys I know would say.

887
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,370
Or girls.

888
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:36,441
Yeah. Well you know, I
mean I think that

889
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:38,644
the concept is more
appealing to me

890
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:41,848
than, you know, the
actual doing it.

891
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,515
I guess... I don't

892
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:43,616
know. I guess I
feel like I ca

893
00:49:43,618 --> 00:49:48,220
n't really perform well
unless I have some sort of

894
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:50,055
emotional connection
to the person.

895
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:51,291
Pffft!

896
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:53,526
I'm sorry.

897
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:55,661
That just sounds so scripted.

898
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,028
Whoa, what does? "I jus

899
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:02,067
t can't perform well if I'm
not emotionally connected."

900
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:04,737
What is that? Your line?

901
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,973
Is that how you get girls
to fall for you?

902
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,074
Okay, 'F' you. Is that my line?

903
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:13,313
Oh! What if falling asleep
during sex is your mutant power?

904
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:15,783
That's a shitty mutant power.

905
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:18,985
If I had a mutant power

906
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:23,856
I'd have the ability to
manifest chairs out of nowhere.

907
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:25,390
See even that's a
better mutant power

908
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,626
and that's a shitty
mutant power.

909
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:30,161
Standing in line at the
post office, waiting to mail a
package.

910
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:32,497
Boom! There's a chair.

911
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:35,668
At the DSHS waiting to
register for food stamps.

912
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,102
Bam! There's a chair.

913
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:42,073
Oh no! All the bean things
fell out of my beanbag chair...

914
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:44,211
Boom! Now it's a normal chair.

915
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:47,281
Problem solved.

916
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:49,782
That's actually very convenient.

917
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:51,418
I know.

918
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:00,191
What about you?

919
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,894
What about me?

920
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,062
When was the last time you...

921
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,733
You know.

922
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:08,836
I don't kiss and tell.

923
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:11,904
What?

924
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:14,740
You rascal!

925
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,174
What are you doing? Where
are you going?

926
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:19,411
I'm supposed to meet some people
at a bonfire down by the beach.

927
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:20,848
You're coming with me.

928
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:30,558
Sshhh!

929
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:32,860
You shush yourself!

930
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:37,029
You're doing fantastic.

931
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:39,065
Oh, my God.

932
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:40,465
I have no idea what I'm doing.

933
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:43,002
Start over. Get better.

934
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:45,472
I need some competition.

935
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:49,809
("Hey Suzzanne" by Posse
begins playing)

936
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:51,411
(off screen)
Oh shit! I already died.

937
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,656
You really are terrible.

938
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:03,756
What is this?

939
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:04,892
You like it?

940
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:08,896
Yeah, it sounds really familiar.

941
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:30,950
If I had a record player

942
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:33,788
I would borrow the
s-h-i-t out of this.

943
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:37,923
I can copy it onto a
tape for you.

944
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:40,526
You said you have a Walkman,
right?

945
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:42,630
I do have a Walkman.

946
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:46,934
That'd be awesome.

947
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:13,561
Uh, do you want to...

948
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:20,968
Play?

949
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:30,576
I need to go to sleep.

950
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:33,346
Uh yeah, I should probably go.

951
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:35,313
You don't have to.

952
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:38,986
You can stay here if
you want to.

953
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:41,721
Are you sure?

954
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:44,557
I mean, would that be weird?

955
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,994
I don't see why it would be.

956
00:53:54,602 --> 00:53:56,401
Need me to turn off the light?

957
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,405
Yes, please.

958
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,280
Oops. Sorry.

959
00:54:12,486 --> 00:54:15,087
Tell me something about yourself

960
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:17,792
that no one else knows.

961
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:23,030
Well I don't like to
refrigerate leftover pizza.

962
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:27,034
I prefer it at room temperature.

963
00:54:28,502 --> 00:54:33,007
(Stella snores)

964
00:54:50,323 --> 00:54:52,593
Ow.

965
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:10,137
(dreamy synth/guitar
music plays)

966
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:19,206
(echoing moans)

967
00:57:48,703 --> 00:57:52,640
(evil laughter)

968
00:57:58,179 --> 00:57:58,978
Cut to... Connor
Zabladowski wakes w

969
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,547
ith a start, smacking his head

970
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:03,415
against the ceiling
of his sleeping vessel.

971
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,719
He winces in pain.

972
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:06,185
(Elijah winces)

973
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:07,686
Connor rubs his
sweat-covered brow.

974
00:58:07,688 --> 00:58:08,687
He sighs.

975
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:10,257
"Zamora."

976
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:14,827
And that's it.

977
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:16,697
That's the scene.

978
00:58:19,633 --> 00:58:21,600
Thank you. Thank you.

979
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:23,435
Nice job, Felix.

980
00:58:23,437 --> 00:58:25,938
Very...

981
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,206
Erotic.

982
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

983
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:29,708
No, thanks I

984
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,511
I've been feeling very
inspired lately.

985
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:34,880
It's... It's... It feels great.

986
00:58:34,882 --> 00:58:37,084
Does anyone else have
any comments?

987
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,452
Caroline.

988
00:58:40,454 --> 00:58:43,322
Caro-LINE.

989
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:45,659
Caroline.

990
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:50,129
I like how the protagonist
dreams of himself

991
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:54,867
as a martian, symbolizing how
disconnected he feels from the
people around him.

992
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:58,237
Even that whole image of the
two of them floating practically

993
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:03,242
naked in the middle of space
conveys a sense of emptiness and
loneliness

994
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:06,845
and just the overall feeling of
not knowing where you're going.

995
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:10,549
Just drifting through life
without any purpose or meaning.

996
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:11,950
And then BANG! Two pe

997
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:16,688
ople meet and now worlds are
forming and stars are exploding.

998
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,193
And everything just starts to
make sense all of a sudden
because these two sad

999
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:23,597
beautiful beings
have finally found each other.

1000
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,397
I love it.

1001
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:28,769
I absolutely love it.

1002
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:43,582
"Symbolizes how disconnected"

1003
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,150
I have a question.

1004
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:47,619
What was the inspiration
for that little thing

1005
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:49,723
at the end?

1006
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:51,725
Umm...

1007
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:53,692
That little...

1008
00:59:53,694 --> 00:59:55,262
(makes clicking teeth noise)

1009
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,663
Oh, yeah yeah uh

1010
00:59:57,665 --> 01:00:00,134
I'm just really into
vagina dentata.

1011
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:03,802
Elijah!

1012
01:00:03,804 --> 01:00:05,538
(door slams closed)

1013
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:05,971
Hey!

1014
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:07,039
Hey man, what's up?

1015
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:08,340
Uh...

1016
01:00:08,342 --> 01:00:11,645
Hey, are you getting a ride home
with Stella today?

1017
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:13,212
Uh no.

1018
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:14,115
Okay.

1019
01:00:14,982 --> 01:00:16,549
Do you know if she, um...

1020
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:19,284
Did she get like,
a new phone number or something?

1021
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,787
She hasn't been responding
to my texts

1022
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:24,123
and you know, I haven't
seen her in a while.

1023
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,491
I haven't seen her either, man.

1024
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:27,726
Gina and I are kind
of on a break right now.

1025
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:29,161
Oh, I'm sorry.

1026
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:31,230
Nah, things were just getting a
little too serious and

1027
01:00:31,232 --> 01:00:34,366
I think it was starting to
have a negative effect on our
open relationship.

1028
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:37,604
Right. Okay. Uh well...

1029
01:00:37,606 --> 01:00:40,038
Hey man, you know I
really liked your script today.

1030
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,740
What you shared of it.

1031
01:00:41,742 --> 01:00:43,275
Oh, thank you.

1032
01:00:43,277 --> 01:00:45,444
Yeah, dude. You got
to finish that.

1033
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:46,478
I will.

1034
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,713
No I mean it. There'

1035
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:49,448
s nothing worse than sitting
on the side of a mountain

1036
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:52,184
looking up at the top and
wishing you were there.

1037
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,421
I take it that was a...
that's a metaphor, huh?

1038
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:56,088
Yeah.

1039
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,390
It's also a line in a
song I wrote.

1040
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:00,459
Got it. All right, man.

1041
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:01,760
Uh... thanks.

1042
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,797
I'll see you.

1043
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:07,735
That's a good line.

1044
01:01:09,436 --> 01:01:12,304
(Felix off screen) Hey, you

1045
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:15,809
I hope all is well.

1046
01:01:17,278 --> 01:01:19,980
If you and Gina

1047
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:25,019
aren't busy tonight

1048
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:29,890
you should come see

1049
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,459
a movie.

1050
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:37,097
I would love

1051
01:01:38,499 --> 01:01:42,201
to see...

1052
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:43,368
(off screen)
Who are you texting?

1053
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,369
Oh my God, Jesus Christ!

1054
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,170
(laughs)

1055
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:46,705
Sorry.

1056
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:49,808
Oh my God, I've told you
so many times not to do that.

1057
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,743
It never gets old.

1058
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:53,045
What are you doing?

1059
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:55,113
Come to steal free
movies from me?

1060
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:57,684
You know I don't watch these
artsy foreign films.

1061
01:01:57,686 --> 01:02:00,719
I just came to grab some
delicious movie theater popcorn.

1062
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:03,556
You came all the way out here
just for some popcorn?

1063
01:02:03,558 --> 01:02:06,091
And to see my little brother!

1064
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:07,125
We really miss you.

1065
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:08,695
We never see you anymore.

1066
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:10,497
Tabby really wants you to
come over for dinner on Friday.

1067
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:14,399
Yeah I don't know.

1068
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:17,004
I'm kind of trying
to keep the evening open

1069
01:02:18,072 --> 01:02:21,408
just in case I hear
from my friend.

1070
01:02:23,877 --> 01:02:27,312
You're kidding.

1071
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:30,050
Sorry, but you're not blowing
me off for plans you don't have.

1072
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:31,285
That's...

1073
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:33,586
Don't be stupid.

1074
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:35,523
I'll see you on Friday.

1075
01:02:37,692 --> 01:02:39,726
Is this seriously
the only way in and out of here?

1076
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:41,893
This trap door thing?

1077
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:42,530
Yeah.

1078
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:46,066
So annoying.

1079
01:02:53,407 --> 01:02:54,373
(off screen) That's what we
need. See, I'm allergic to

1080
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,308
everything,
so we can't have anything...

1081
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,744
Please don't pepper spray me.

1082
01:02:57,746 --> 01:02:59,913
It's just Felix!

1083
01:03:01,815 --> 01:03:04,552
(Tabby off screen)
And there he is!

1084
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:10,989
You're all dressed up.

1085
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:13,593
You just get back
from a funeral or something?

1086
01:03:13,595 --> 01:03:15,460
Oh. Ha ha.

1087
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:18,299
Felix, this is my friend I
told you about.

1088
01:03:18,767 --> 01:03:19,498
Emma.

1089
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,068
Hi, it's really nice
to meet you.

1090
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,272
Nice to meet you too.

1091
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:30,610
We were thinking of going
out to eat instead of cooking

1092
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:35,080
and then going to see a
movie afterwards.

1093
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,148
What do you think?

1094
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,016
That sounds great.

1095
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,217
Excellent.

1096
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:41,453
What do you say we make
like a Popsicle and split

1097
01:03:41,455 --> 01:03:44,122
then, shall we?

1098
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:46,493
We already made reservations.

1099
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:55,067
Hey, be a good sport.

1100
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:58,506
I'm sure you'll like the movie
at least.

1101
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:06,046
(screams and gunshots from
off screen movie)

1102
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:20,258
(Felix's VOICE OVER)
I really wish they'd

1103
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:23,295
stop trying to set me up
with their friends.

1104
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:25,497
It's a nice
gesture, but...

1105
01:04:25,499 --> 01:04:26,568
It's a waste of her time.

1106
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:29,937
I like what you did there.

1107
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:33,238
What?

1108
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,307
"It's not fair to HER."

1109
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:37,344
"It's a waste
of HER time."

1110
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:41,281
That's a solid
defense mechanism.

1111
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:49,722
How come we never tried?

1112
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:51,058
Being more than friends?

1113
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:52,393
Yeah.

1114
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,660
We're pretty compatible.

1115
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:56,061
We're super compatible.

1116
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,263
Conversation never runs dry.

1117
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:00,399
We always have a million things
to talk about.

1118
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:02,635
We really like each
other's company.

1119
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:06,438
I like being around you more
than I like being around most
people.

1120
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,608
What if you actually like me?

1121
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,975
Of course I like you.

1122
01:05:09,977 --> 01:05:13,247
Like, "like me" like me.

1123
01:05:14,148 --> 01:05:16,917
Maybe I do.

1124
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:22,187
Do you like me?

1125
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:24,690
You'll never know if
you don't ask.

1126
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:26,458
That's true.

1127
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,729
But do you really
want to do that?

1128
01:05:29,731 --> 01:05:31,633
What if it ruins our friendship?

1129
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:35,235
What if it turns out

1130
01:05:36,503 --> 01:05:39,137
that you like me

1131
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:42,274
but I don't like you?

1132
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:46,480
And then I feel weird being
around you once I know you have
feelings for me.

1133
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:47,847
Yeah. Yeah.

1134
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:48,180
No, no, no. See, I don't want

1135
01:05:48,182 --> 01:05:51,216
that to happen.

1136
01:05:51,218 --> 01:05:55,353
I don't want to be the the cool
guy friend who ends up fucking
up a perfectly solid

1137
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:58,192
platonic friendship just because
I came down with a crush.

1138
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:01,195
I think that's what I'm
most afraid of.

1139
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:05,497
Finally falling head over heels
for someone

1140
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,367
who doesn't feel the
same way I do.

1141
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,671
Again.

1142
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,971
Is it worth the risk?

1143
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:16,041
You know, honestly, I
think I'd rather never tell you

1144
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:19,946
how I feel about you than
potentially lose you as my
friend.

1145
01:06:19,948 --> 01:06:23,350
Then again, maybe I'll
feel the same way you do.

1146
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:25,618
You think so?

1147
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,285
It's a possibility.

1148
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:29,087
Yeah. See, I don't know.

1149
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:33,726
You know, I haven't seen or
heard from you in quite a while.

1150
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,127
I feel like something's
got to be up.

1151
01:06:36,129 --> 01:06:37,262
I mean, did I do something wrong

1152
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:40,499
last time we hung out?

1153
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:41,669
You know, there was that moment

1154
01:06:43,938 --> 01:06:45,505
we were sitting
on your bed

1155
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:47,307
and we were a
little drunk.

1156
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,510
And for a second I thought

1157
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:52,647
maybe we were about to kiss.

1158
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:55,447
But we didn't.

1159
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:55,783
No.

1160
01:06:57,184 --> 01:06:59,819
We did agree from the beginning
that both of us

1161
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:02,688
just wanted to be friends.

1162
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,289
It's very true.

1163
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:06,324
But who knows?

1164
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:09,196
Maybe that has nothing to do
with why you haven't seen me
recently.

1165
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:12,598
Yeah. I mean, maybe...

1166
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,634
Maybe you've just
been really busy.

1167
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:17,469
I've probably just
been really busy.

1168
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:18,938
Or...

1169
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,575
- Maybe you have a boyfriend.
- Maybe I have a boyfriend.

1170
01:07:21,074 --> 01:07:22,407
Shit.

1171
01:07:22,409 --> 01:07:25,580
But you don't know that.

1172
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:27,713
Maybe I don't.

1173
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:28,915
Right.

1174
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,215
And like I said

1175
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:31,416
I'll never know

1176
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:32,952
if I don't ask you.

1177
01:07:32,954 --> 01:07:34,288
Mm-Hmm.

1178
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,489
Maybe I should call
you right now.

1179
01:07:37,491 --> 01:07:39,393
See if you want to meet
up sometime next week.

1180
01:07:40,995 --> 01:07:44,162
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1181
01:07:44,164 --> 01:07:45,297
Wait...

1182
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:46,966
Maybe I'll text.

1183
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:48,300
Keep it casual.

1184
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:50,838
It's not urgent.

1185
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:58,145
Uh-oh. Looks like your
little fantasy sequence is about
to end.

1186
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:01,446
(loud booming sounds)

1187
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:01,981
I'm sorry... You want some? You

1188
01:08:01,983 --> 01:08:03,851
want some?!

1189
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:17,497
It's a good movie.

1190
01:08:21,301 --> 01:08:26,774
(cellphone vibrating)

1191
01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:08,916
I love this girl.

1192
01:09:41,616 --> 01:09:44,684
(Gina off screen) But at least
he bothered to tell me, I guess.

1193
01:09:44,686 --> 01:09:47,953
Instead of keeping it a secret
or just blowing me off.

1194
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:51,924
I think I just wasn't ready for
it to end when it did, or the
way it did.

1195
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:55,061
Hey, that sounds exactly
like my last relationship.

1196
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:57,697
Except for the part about
telling you instead of keeping
it a secret.

1197
01:09:57,699 --> 01:09:59,165
Elijah called her last night

1198
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,366
to tell her he was about to
have sex with someone else

1199
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,135
and that he doesn't
want to see her anymore.

1200
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:05,171
Eesh... That's rough.

1201
01:10:05,173 --> 01:10:07,506
Even though we were never
officially going out, I still
feel like

1202
01:10:07,508 --> 01:10:08,974
I just got dumped.

1203
01:10:08,976 --> 01:10:10,609
Whatever. Boys suck.

1204
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:14,379
I just want to get stoned.

1205
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:17,149
You'll always have
Jordan Catalano.

1206
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:20,553
Oh my God, Stella!

1207
01:10:20,555 --> 01:10:22,555
Okay, I know what I'm
doing tonight.

1208
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:26,859
Pajama party starring me, a
fatty blunt, and "My So-called
Life."

1209
01:10:26,861 --> 01:10:28,761
Mmm... I'm coming for you,
Jordan!

1210
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:28,994
St.

1211
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:30,462
Op it!

1212
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:32,363
Okay, I'm getting the
fart out of here.

1213
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:33,566
Have fun playing
"ketchup."

1214
01:10:33,568 --> 01:10:34,700
Love you, bitches!

1215
01:10:34,702 --> 01:10:35,469
Love you.

1216
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:42,208
Hey, how's it going?
How's everything?

1217
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,643
Stella...

1218
01:10:44,645 --> 01:10:47,445
You're not going to introduce me
to your new friend?

1219
01:10:47,447 --> 01:10:50,116
Nora, this is Felix.

1220
01:10:50,118 --> 01:10:54,086
Oh, you're Felix.

1221
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:54,887
That's me.

1222
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:56,722
You're the filmmaker guy.

1223
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:59,058
I've heard a
lot about you.

1224
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,559
Okay.

1225
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:01,694
So what are you guys drinking?

1226
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:03,898
You seem like a cheap
beer kind of guy.

1227
01:11:04,732 --> 01:11:07,133
When you're right, you're right.

1228
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:07,835
All right.

1229
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:09,668
Stell-belle?

1230
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,573
I'll do the same actually.

1231
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:16,443
Like two peas in a pod.

1232
01:11:18,311 --> 01:11:19,612
She's good.

1233
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:21,983
(finishes the
drink loudly)

1234
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:27,320
All right, kids. Here you
go. You need anything else?

1235
01:11:28,488 --> 01:11:30,321
I think we're good.

1236
01:11:30,323 --> 01:11:31,624
All right.

1237
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:34,327
You just let me know
when you need me.

1238
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:39,867
Do you want to
get a table?

1239
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:43,235
Yeah.

1240
01:11:43,237 --> 01:11:45,372
You know, I had a dream
about you the other night.

1241
01:11:46,641 --> 01:11:47,640
You did?

1242
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:48,774
Mm hmm.

1243
01:11:48,776 --> 01:11:51,610
The night before you texted me,
actually.

1244
01:11:51,612 --> 01:11:54,180
Cool. What happened?

1245
01:11:54,182 --> 01:11:58,316
All I really remember
is that you were selling

1246
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:01,954
tangerines from a food cart
on a cobblestone road somewhere

1247
01:12:01,956 --> 01:12:04,123
in like France or Italy.

1248
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,826
And you had just recently
shaved your head

1249
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:11,429
and got married to a guy named
Jeff, but he spelled his name
like JEEF.

1250
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:15,968
And you guys had a kid together.
And he hated cheddar cheese.

1251
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,570
Who hated cheddar cheese?

1252
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:18,871
The kid or Jeff?

1253
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:20,005
Jeef.

1254
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,173
That really happened.

1255
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:24,009
You had some weird facial
piercings too.

1256
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:26,979
Like one of those barbell things
between your eyes

1257
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:29,315
and one of those little
silver studs on your upper lip

1258
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:32,618
that everybody thinks is really
cute, but it looks like a stray
booger.

1259
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,552
The "Monroe."

1260
01:12:33,554 --> 01:12:34,687
That's it.

1261
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:36,622
Yeah, I just got that
taken out yesterday.

1262
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:37,756
It healed up quick.

1263
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:40,326
Regeneration. That's my
mutant power.

1264
01:12:40,328 --> 01:12:43,696
I thought it was the power to
fall asleep in the middle of
having sex.

1265
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:44,964
Of course you did.

1266
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:48,000
Because your mutant power
is forgetfulness.

1267
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:49,500
Oh shoot. You're right.

1268
01:12:49,502 --> 01:12:51,402
I always forget that.

1269
01:12:51,404 --> 01:12:53,272
Of course you do.

1270
01:12:53,274 --> 01:12:55,774
Speaking of which,
before I forget

1271
01:12:55,776 --> 01:12:59,080
I made you a copy of
that album that you wanted.

1272
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:01,547
The one we were

1273
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:04,482
listening to back at my house.

1274
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:06,754
Oh yeah...

1275
01:13:07,355 --> 01:13:08,756
Thank you.

1276
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:14,093
Wait a minute.

1277
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:17,096
Is this why I haven't seen you
in almost two months?

1278
01:13:17,098 --> 01:13:19,899
Because you've been spending
your every waking moment

1279
01:13:19,901 --> 01:13:23,537
painstakingly replicating this
onto tape for me?

1280
01:13:26,173 --> 01:13:29,141
I'm not trying to make
you feel bad.

1281
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:29,877
I'm just.

1282
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,179
I'm just being a goofball.

1283
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:35,650
Goofball is a weird word.

1284
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:37,683
It is a weird word.

1285
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:38,517
It's a real weird word.

1286
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:41,088
It's a weal weiwd wowd.

1287
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:50,497
You know, um

1288
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:55,267
I've been thinking about
you a ton lately.

1289
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:57,102
Um, yeah

1290
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,205
I don't know um...

1291
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,007
How do I say this.?

1292
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:03,776
Did I tell you that me
and Nora started

1293
01:14:03,778 --> 01:14:05,212
seeing each other?

1294
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:09,850
What?

1295
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:11,550
Um...

1296
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:12,853
You and who?

1297
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:15,455
Nora.

1298
01:14:17,858 --> 01:14:20,795
Nora...

1299
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:37,812
The bartender?

1300
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:40,982
Mm hmm.

1301
01:14:43,851 --> 01:14:45,987
(loud maniacal laughter)

1302
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,257
No...

1303
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:54,128
No, you didn't tell me that.

1304
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:57,665
Since when?

1305
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:00,634
I don't know.

1306
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:05,806
Maybe like, two months.

1307
01:15:07,141 --> 01:15:08,173
Oh.

1308
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,609
We've been friends
for a long time.

1309
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:12,344
Yeah, it feels like we have.

1310
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:17,516
I mean me and Nora. She was one
of the first people I met when I
moved here.

1311
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:20,586
I guess we kind of both always
had a thing for each other

1312
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:24,123
but we were both too afraid
to say anything.

1313
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:28,060
So how did you find out?

1314
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:29,997
That night at the bonfire
down by the beach.

1315
01:15:31,499 --> 01:15:34,466
Somebody sent Nora a text
saying I'd come looking for.

1316
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:35,934
You weren't looking for her.

1317
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:37,770
That's why we were there.

1318
01:15:37,772 --> 01:15:40,007
She invited me.

1319
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:44,043
Okay.

1320
01:15:44,045 --> 01:15:47,613
The next morning, I woke
up to a bunch of drunk texts

1321
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:51,984
from her saying how she thought
I was really cute and how

1322
01:15:51,986 --> 01:15:53,952
she'd always kind of
had a crush on me

1323
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:56,090
so things just kind of
went from there.

1324
01:15:57,124 --> 01:15:59,927
That was the night I
stayed over.

1325
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:05,966
Okay.

1326
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:19,146
Well I'm happy for you.

1327
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,148
Are you?

1328
01:16:21,849 --> 01:16:22,716
(gulps loudly)

1329
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,118
Yeah.

1330
01:16:24,718 --> 01:16:26,887
Yeah.

1331
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:30,389
Good.

1332
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:33,625
Because I talk about you a lot,
and I know

1333
01:16:33,627 --> 01:16:36,897
Nora really wants all of us
to hang out together.

1334
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:41,102
I would love to hang
out with you...

1335
01:16:42,803 --> 01:16:46,038
And your girlfriend...

1336
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,608
Together.

1337
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,612
I'm glad to hear that.

1338
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:12,399
(thunder rumbles overhead)

1339
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:15,868
Oh!

1340
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:17,870
Haha! Eat shit, Derryl!

1341
01:17:17,872 --> 01:17:19,707
You fuckin' asshole! Haha!

1342
01:17:20,575 --> 01:17:22,209
(groans in pain)

1343
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:30,117
(French pop song begins playing)

1344
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:02,047
(Nora off screen) It's just
such a trashy looking format.

1345
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:04,750
(Stella off screen) That doesn't
mean it can't be nostalgic.

1346
01:18:04,752 --> 01:18:06,485
(Nora off screen) Okay but
when I think of "nostalgic"

1347
01:18:06,487 --> 01:18:09,656
I think of like eight millimeter
or like Super-8 films.

1348
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:11,524
You know, like the opening
of "The Wonder Years."

1349
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:13,058
(Stella off screen)
Sure, but when I was growing up

1350
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,793
we didn't have Super-8.

1351
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:16,161
It was the nineties. We had t

1352
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:21,433
his big, bulky VHS camera that
my dad recorded everything with

1353
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:23,404
even when it was super outdated.

1354
01:18:24,405 --> 01:18:26,438
Oh, that is so "Bob."

1355
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,774
Whenever I think about
my childhood...

1356
01:18:28,776 --> 01:18:33,214
Unlike Kevin Arnold or Winnie
Cooper or Paul
What's-His-Name...

1357
01:18:34,114 --> 01:18:37,282
My memories play out in VHS.

1358
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:41,588
Timestamped and auto-date
flashing in the corner of the
screen.

1359
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,789
Having to adjust
the tracking in all the spots

1360
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:47,159
the magnetic tape of your memory
fails you.

1361
01:18:47,161 --> 01:18:49,795
Trashy or not, in my opinion...

1362
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:52,733
VHS is the quintessence
of nostalgia.

1363
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:55,834
That's a really beautiful image.

1364
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:58,105
Pun intended, I hope.

1365
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:04,078
You guys really are like
two peas in a pod.

1366
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:07,913
Felix, are you okay?

1367
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:09,950
You look really uncomfortable.

1368
01:19:11,151 --> 01:19:13,085
Oh my gosh. I totally
called you out.

1369
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:14,319
I'm sorry. You're not... You'

1370
01:19:14,321 --> 01:19:18,156
re not calling me out
because I'm just being normal.

1371
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:23,128
Felix, what are you doing
for Halloween?

1372
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,764
Oh, my gosh. Okay,
you should totally come.

1373
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:28,934
I'm not excited about this,
but you probably will like it.

1374
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:31,903
We're going to that haunted
house in Georgetown next
weekend.

1375
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:33,740
You should come with us.

1376
01:19:33,742 --> 01:19:36,074
Uh, yeah. Uh...

1377
01:19:36,076 --> 01:19:38,511
That sounds really fun.

1378
01:19:38,513 --> 01:19:38,877
Thanks.

1379
01:19:38,879 --> 01:19:40,479
But

1380
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:44,449
I don't have a costume or
anything so...

1381
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:46,852
You have like a week
to pull something together.

1382
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:47,620
You're creative.

1383
01:19:47,622 --> 01:19:48,920
You can figure it out.

1384
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:51,624
He's coming. Besides...

1385
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:52,293
What else are you going to do?

1386
01:19:53,827 --> 01:19:55,260
You're right.

1387
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:57,563
What else am
I going to do?

1388
01:19:57,565 --> 01:19:58,797
Yay! Oh my gosh...

1389
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:00,799
It's going to be so much fun.

1390
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:03,135
Oh, and I'm going to need
all the protection I can get

1391
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:06,639
because haunted houses creep
me the fuck out.

1392
01:20:06,641 --> 01:20:07,472
(off screen)
Thank you. (Karaoke Host of

1393
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,476
(f screen)
Let's hear it for Eddie!

1394
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:14,413
Next up we've got
Nora and Stella!

1395
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:15,280
Oh, that's us!

1396
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:16,248
Oh my gosh, yes!

1397
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:18,218
Give them a warm
welcome to the stage.

1398
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:45,379
(Ilana off screen) You need to
figure out what your intentions
are.

1399
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,814
I don't have any intentions.

1400
01:20:47,816 --> 01:20:49,114
I just don't want this...
This stupid relationsh

1401
01:20:49,116 --> 01:20:56,121
ip of theirs to get in the
way of our friendship.

1402
01:20:56,123 --> 01:20:57,255
Why are you smiling?

1403
01:20:57,257 --> 01:20:59,391
It's just really cute
seeing you like this.

1404
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:02,528
What? No no. No it's not cute.

1405
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,830
It's not cute.

1406
01:21:03,832 --> 01:21:05,897
She's the best friend that I've
made since I moved here

1407
01:21:05,899 --> 01:21:07,299
and I don't want to lose that.

1408
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:10,969
Okay, Mr. "I don't want to
be in a relationship right now."

1409
01:21:10,971 --> 01:21:11,470
Okay... You know what? You need

1410
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:13,472
to chill, okay?

1411
01:21:13,474 --> 01:21:16,576
As much as I love seeing you
head over heels for someone

1412
01:21:16,578 --> 01:21:17,643
I got to be honest.

1413
01:21:17,645 --> 01:21:19,512
I don't think this is
good for you.

1414
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:21,012
How is it not good for me?

1415
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:22,147
What does that even mean?

1416
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:23,783
You said she's queer, right?

1417
01:21:23,785 --> 01:21:25,350
Whoa, no no no no no no

1418
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:26,853
I never called her the "Q word."

1419
01:21:26,855 --> 01:21:28,153
I said she had a girlfriend.

1420
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:28,887
(laughs)What, isn'

1421
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:30,656
t that like a derogatory slur?

1422
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:31,423
Forget it. Look, Felix,
you just spent the past 30 min

1423
01:21:31,425 --> 01:21:36,061
utes telling me how miserable

1424
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:37,896
you've been these last few weeks

1425
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:39,667
hanging out with her and
her girlfriend.

1426
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:41,534
Yeah.

1427
01:21:41,536 --> 01:21:44,202
Hanging out with her and
her GIRLFRIEND.

1428
01:21:44,204 --> 01:21:47,038
That doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

1429
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,108
I mean, just because she has a
girlfriend now doesn't mean
she...

1430
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,177
Oh my God, Felix, I
respect you so much...

1431
01:21:52,179 --> 01:21:54,012
Please don't say anything
stupid right now.

1432
01:21:54,014 --> 01:21:55,282
What?

1433
01:21:56,584 --> 01:21:57,850
Maybe that type of thing

1434
01:21:57,852 --> 01:22:00,152
doesn't mean
anything to everyone

1435
01:22:00,154 --> 01:22:02,354
but to a lot of people it does.

1436
01:22:02,356 --> 01:22:04,189
Look at you
and look at me.

1437
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:06,324
Okay, well...

1438
01:22:06,326 --> 01:22:08,162
Even you got pregnant
in high school.

1439
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:11,764
That was an accident.

1440
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:14,299
That was literally one time.
I was drunk.

1441
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:15,902
I was experimenting.

1442
01:22:15,904 --> 01:22:17,002
Why would you bring that up?

1443
01:22:17,004 --> 01:22:19,772
You know how I feel about that.

1444
01:22:19,774 --> 01:22:20,939
I'm sorry.

1445
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:22,644
I don't know why I said that.

1446
01:22:24,077 --> 01:22:27,078
Anyway, I just don't want
you to get hurt.

1447
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,247
I love that you like this
person so much.

1448
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:34,119
But as your sister and as
your friend

1449
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,356
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

1450
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:39,460
Well thank you...

1451
01:22:40,762 --> 01:22:42,496
And I don't know what I'm doing.

1452
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:51,671
I really like your decorations.

1453
01:22:51,673 --> 01:22:53,675
(Stella off screen) Thanks!
Help yourself to some candy.

1454
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:57,810
Don't mind if I do.

1455
01:22:57,812 --> 01:23:01,215
Drop that
Snickers, Mister.

1456
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:06,286
Thems is mine.

1457
01:23:06,921 --> 01:23:07,787
Gina, hey!

1458
01:23:07,789 --> 01:23:09,254
Hey, Fee-fee. How are you?

1459
01:23:09,256 --> 01:23:10,055
I'm good. I'm

1460
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:11,490
I'm all right. I wa

1461
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:14,660
s just telling Stella how much
I really like your decorations.

1462
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:16,163
Did you guys plan this?

1463
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:17,532
What?

1464
01:23:18,098 --> 01:23:19,066
Stella!

1465
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:24,772
You guys both dressed as shitty
vampire versions of yourselves.

1466
01:23:25,472 --> 01:23:26,139
Wow.

1467
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:28,674
Are you...

1468
01:23:28,676 --> 01:23:30,643
Coming with us to the
haunted house?

1469
01:23:30,645 --> 01:23:31,142
No.

1470
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:32,177
I'm exhausted.

1471
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:33,513
I don't even like
haunted houses.

1472
01:23:33,515 --> 01:23:35,681
None of my friends like
haunted houses.

1473
01:23:35,683 --> 01:23:36,281
I don't get it.

1474
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:37,148
You got to go.

1475
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:39,251
It's going to be...

1476
01:23:39,253 --> 01:23:41,486
So much fun.

1477
01:23:41,488 --> 01:23:42,655
Please.

1478
01:23:42,657 --> 01:23:45,591
Mm-mm. I'm too stoned.

1479
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:47,760
Like I actually make
shit my pants.

1480
01:23:47,762 --> 01:23:50,863
Shit pants! Shit pants!
Shit pants!

1481
01:23:50,865 --> 01:23:53,031
Let me get a photo of you
two before you go.

1482
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:53,766
Ugh! She hates

1483
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:55,367
it when I take her photo.

1484
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:57,870
Is it because you're stealing
part of her soul?

1485
01:23:57,872 --> 01:23:59,839
I hate the way I smile.

1486
01:23:59,841 --> 01:24:00,773
Don't smile.

1487
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:02,542
Pretend like it's our
prom picture

1488
01:24:02,544 --> 01:24:04,276
and we're really bummed out.

1489
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:06,612
Like we just got an argument
about how I didn't

1490
01:24:06,614 --> 01:24:09,815
bring the proper corsage to
match your dress or something.

1491
01:24:09,817 --> 01:24:11,182
See, I like that.

1492
01:24:11,184 --> 01:24:13,553
Yeah, so just like...

1493
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:14,822
Like it's the worst day
of your life.

1494
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:18,858
Should we hold hands?
Like real loosely?

1495
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:23,061
Like we just feel obligated to?

1496
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:25,767
(Gina off screen)
This is fucking hilarious.

1497
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:33,906
That's great.

1498
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:36,209
Yeah, it looks like my
actual prom photo.

1499
01:24:37,045 --> 01:24:39,413
You should keep it.

1500
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:41,179
No... No no

1501
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:43,315
I think you
should have it.

1502
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:46,351
Ahem! Maybe the
photographer wants it.

1503
01:24:46,353 --> 01:24:48,420
Right. Sorry.

1504
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:49,220
I'm just kidding.

1505
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:51,391
You guys keep it.

1506
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,226
Should we get going?

1507
01:24:55,228 --> 01:24:56,161
Uh yeah...

1508
01:24:56,163 --> 01:24:59,130
Oh, what about uh...
Where's Nora?

1509
01:24:59,132 --> 01:25:01,468
We're going to pick her
up on the way.

1510
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:04,504
Awesome.

1511
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:08,975
(Stella off screen)
She should be here any minute.

1512
01:25:08,977 --> 01:25:10,108
(Felix off screen)
You want me to get in the back?

1513
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,310
No, you're fine.

1514
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:14,046
How are things?

1515
01:25:14,048 --> 01:25:15,081
The two of you.

1516
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:16,214
You and Nora.

1517
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:18,753
I mean, we haven't started being
shitty to each other yet so

1518
01:25:19,486 --> 01:25:21,520
I guess that's good.

1519
01:25:21,522 --> 01:25:24,389
Because that's inevitable?

1520
01:25:24,391 --> 01:25:27,528
Maybe. But yeah, we
have fun together.

1521
01:25:28,462 --> 01:25:31,164
I like her a lot. You know that.

1522
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:36,136
Yeah, I know that.

1523
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:37,970
(lound bang)

1524
01:25:37,972 --> 01:25:40,173
- Oh!
- Ah Jesus!

1525
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:43,976
God, I turn my back
for one second

1526
01:25:43,978 --> 01:25:45,847
and you're already trying to
steal my girlfriend?

1527
01:25:47,015 --> 01:25:47,947
What?

1528
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:49,582
No no no no

1529
01:25:49,584 --> 01:25:52,150
I'm fucking with you, Felix.

1530
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:53,586
You two really look
you together.

1531
01:25:53,588 --> 01:25:56,656
What are you supposed to
be, like twin zombies or
something?

1532
01:25:56,658 --> 01:25:58,323
Vampires!

1533
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:00,793
Hm! I guess I missed the memo.

1534
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:02,227
We did not...

1535
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:04,866
It was a... It was a
coincidence.

1536
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,000
Like two peas in a pod.

1537
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:10,670
Stop it.

1538
01:26:10,672 --> 01:26:12,707
Just remember, at the end
of the night

1539
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:16,008
I get to go home with her.

1540
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,311
Aren't you presumptuous?

1541
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:20,546
Oh my God... You look so

1542
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:22,982
fucking hot right now.
You know I just want to

1543
01:26:22,984 --> 01:26:25,084
"you know what" you right now!

1544
01:26:25,086 --> 01:26:26,919
How was your work party?

1545
01:26:26,921 --> 01:26:28,253
You smell boozy.

1546
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:30,925
My coworkers kept shoving
drinks down my throat all night.

1547
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:33,559
So many martinis.

1548
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:34,327
Are you doing okay?

1549
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:38,196
I'm wonderful, darling.
Thank you!

1550
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:40,099
Your mascara is running.

1551
01:26:40,101 --> 01:26:42,235
Oh, because I'm
"When Doves Cry."

1552
01:26:44,906 --> 01:26:47,374
I'm "When Doves Cry." Like
the Prince song?

1553
01:26:48,442 --> 01:26:49,977
It's my costume.

1554
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:54,446
That's really clever actually.

1555
01:26:54,448 --> 01:26:56,984
Hey, Stell-belle! How badly do
you want to go to this haunted
house thing?

1556
01:26:58,251 --> 01:27:00,186
Do not even try it.

1557
01:27:00,188 --> 01:27:01,921
Oh, come on!

1558
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:04,456
You know how much I hate
haunted houses.

1559
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:06,025
Can't we like, go back
to your house

1560
01:27:06,027 --> 01:27:07,427
and play Mad Libs or something?

1561
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:08,696
Nora...

1562
01:27:09,197 --> 01:27:09,595
Fine.

1563
01:27:09,597 --> 01:27:11,296
You guys go without me.

1564
01:27:11,298 --> 01:27:13,465
Just drop me off at
my apartment.

1565
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:15,233
Are you serious?

1566
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:16,367
Mm-hmm.

1567
01:27:16,369 --> 01:27:19,941
You guys just go have
fun without me.

1568
01:27:34,722 --> 01:27:36,188
(Nora laughs and snorts loudly)

1569
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:39,191
Remember Gina is sleeping, okay?

1570
01:27:39,193 --> 01:27:40,559
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1571
01:27:40,561 --> 01:27:41,861
You're just so funny.

1572
01:27:41,863 --> 01:27:43,495
May I continue?

1573
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:44,764
Please."...after

1574
01:27:44,766 --> 01:27:49,135
one drink. And someone
has to wake her up

1575
01:27:49,137 --> 01:27:53,906
so she doesn't get kicked out of
the geriatric facility?"

1576
01:27:53,908 --> 01:27:56,509
(Nora laughs loud)

1577
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:59,444
Oh my Gosh, you have the
cutest little giggle.

1578
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:00,782
I love it.

1579
01:28:03,483 --> 01:28:06,051
All right, you guys
pick the next one.

1580
01:28:06,053 --> 01:28:08,790
I'm going to use the bathroom
and put on some music.

1581
01:28:09,657 --> 01:28:12,760
Hurry back, my love!

1582
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,434
I think I'm gonna get
another beer.

1583
01:28:24,005 --> 01:28:27,708
I'm... I'm a little drunk.

1584
01:28:30,144 --> 01:28:33,346
But I got to ask you something.

1585
01:28:37,952 --> 01:28:40,953
You're a real catch.

1586
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:44,123
I mean, really, I get why

1587
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:46,093
Stella likes you.

1588
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:49,427
No, no, no, I...

1589
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:51,797
What's your deal?

1590
01:28:51,799 --> 01:28:56,302
Like... Why aren't
you with anyone?

1591
01:28:56,304 --> 01:29:00,072
Is it because you don't want to
be like, tied down or whatever?

1592
01:29:00,074 --> 01:29:02,643
That's what Stella says,
and I get it.

1593
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,344
Yeah.

1594
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:11,050
I just DON'T get it.

1595
01:29:11,052 --> 01:29:13,619
Because when I meet
someone like you

1596
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:16,090
and they're not in a
relationship.

1597
01:29:17,892 --> 01:29:20,493
I just.

1598
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:23,095
I mean, there's...

1599
01:29:23,097 --> 01:29:25,700
There's got to be something,
right?

1600
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,702
There's got to be a reason

1601
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:33,074
why you're not
with anyone.

1602
01:29:33,608 --> 01:29:36,077
Am I wrong?

1603
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:43,582
Oh, I'm sorry I made you
uncomfortable.

1604
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:45,317
No. No no...

1605
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:46,318
It's none of my business.

1606
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,821
I'm fine. I'm not uncomfortable.

1607
01:29:48,823 --> 01:29:52,091
It's just that before
Stella and I started going out

1608
01:29:52,093 --> 01:29:57,363
she would go on and on about how
crappy all the guys she knew
were.

1609
01:29:57,365 --> 01:29:59,365
How when they realized
that when she didn't want to be

1610
01:29:59,367 --> 01:30:02,701
anything more than friends, they
either treat her like garbage

1611
01:30:02,703 --> 01:30:06,372
or wouldn't even bother
talking to her.

1612
01:30:06,374 --> 01:30:09,810
But she always had good things
to say about you.

1613
01:30:11,379 --> 01:30:14,649
Great things to say about you.

1614
01:30:17,318 --> 01:30:19,486
(a record begins playing)

1615
01:30:22,123 --> 01:30:24,191
I forgot the point I was
trying to make.

1616
01:30:25,059 --> 01:30:27,593
Maybe it's me.

1617
01:30:27,595 --> 01:30:30,930
Maybe I just can't
stand being single.

1618
01:30:30,932 --> 01:30:34,969
Maybe that's why I don't get it.

1619
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:42,574
There's gotta be someone that
you're a little into.

1620
01:30:42,576 --> 01:30:44,078
Hmmm?

1621
01:30:46,247 --> 01:30:47,148
Yeah.

1622
01:30:47,682 --> 01:30:50,217
There's someone.

1623
01:30:51,152 --> 01:30:52,217
Or... There wa

1624
01:30:52,219 --> 01:30:57,091
s someone.
But they're unavailable now.

1625
01:30:57,925 --> 01:30:59,961
So that's that.

1626
01:31:04,565 --> 01:31:06,165
Wow. Uh

1627
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:07,465
I didn't realize how
late it was.

1628
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:08,667
I should probably get going.

1629
01:31:08,669 --> 01:31:10,269
Oh, no. Oh, shit.

1630
01:31:10,271 --> 01:31:11,837
No, no.

1631
01:31:11,839 --> 01:31:13,639
Oh, I made it awkward.

1632
01:31:13,641 --> 01:31:14,474
No, no... It...

1633
01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:16,442
It's not awkward.

1634
01:31:16,444 --> 01:31:19,013
I just... You
know, it's...

1635
01:31:19,747 --> 01:31:21,248
It's too late.

1636
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,317
Do you want to take
another beer for the road?

1637
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:25,985
No, thanks.

1638
01:31:25,987 --> 01:31:29,054
I'm pretty drunk already anyway.

1639
01:31:29,056 --> 01:31:31,792
Well thanks for hanging out,
and talking with me.

1640
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:34,093
It was my pleasure.

1641
01:31:34,095 --> 01:31:34,795
Ohhh!

1642
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:44,536
And Stella, as always

1643
01:31:44,538 --> 01:31:47,274
it was very nice to see you.

1644
01:31:55,649 --> 01:31:57,718
Yeah.

1645
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,288
I'll see you.

1646
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,591
Goodbye, Felix.

1647
01:32:05,593 --> 01:32:09,194
Get home safely.

1648
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:11,599
(door opens and closes)

1649
01:32:14,068 --> 01:32:14,769
What?

1650
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,838
Nothing.

1651
01:32:32,586 --> 01:32:34,686
This is crazy.

1652
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:38,290
You need to stop.

1653
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:41,328
(melancholy music plays
over montage)

1654
01:33:08,956 --> 01:33:10,322
(Stella off screen)
Hey Felix, it's Stella

1655
01:33:10,324 --> 01:33:12,124
Nora and I just got out
of this movie

1656
01:33:12,126 --> 01:33:15,794
that I think you will love
called "Romance of the Flesh."

1657
01:33:15,796 --> 01:33:18,997
It's this insane new cannibal
exploitation film from Italy.

1658
01:33:18,999 --> 01:33:20,899
It is gross! So gross!

1659
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:25,070
It's basically like if Ingmar
Bergman directed Cannibal
Holocaust.

1660
01:33:25,072 --> 01:33:27,306
You've got to see it. Anyway...

1661
01:33:27,308 --> 01:33:29,376
Let's hang out some time!

1662
01:33:35,316 --> 01:33:38,083
- It's a shapeshifter. - That's
a science fiction term,
Zabladowski.

1663
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:40,619
Can you think of a better one?

1664
01:33:40,621 --> 01:33:42,990
How about "Therian
Metamorphosis?"

1665
01:33:44,725 --> 01:33:45,124
- All right, you win. - We
come to a large window that
looks into an inc

1666
01:33:45,126 --> 01:33:49,995
ubation room...

1667
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:51,132
(Audio begins to echo
and become muted)

1668
01:34:14,121 --> 01:34:16,021
(Evelyn off screen) Felix!

1669
01:34:16,023 --> 01:34:17,890
Huh?

1670
01:34:17,892 --> 01:34:20,425
How was it?

1671
01:34:20,427 --> 01:34:23,328
Oh, fine.

1672
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:24,631
I'm sorry.

1673
01:34:24,633 --> 01:34:27,866
It was great.

1674
01:34:27,868 --> 01:34:30,736
I'm sorry, I just suddenly
realized how much I

1675
01:34:30,738 --> 01:34:33,440
I just don't care
about this script anymore.

1676
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:38,310
You know, I've been working on
this thing for the last six
years

1677
01:34:38,312 --> 01:34:39,546
and who am I kidding?

1678
01:34:39,548 --> 01:34:42,447
I'm never going to be
able to shoot this.

1679
01:34:42,449 --> 01:34:44,483
Just think of how much
time I've wasted.

1680
01:34:44,485 --> 01:34:45,552
Hey, don't say that,
man. Yeah, we can

1681
01:34:45,554 --> 01:34:48,455
work through the
kinks. That's why we're here.

1682
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:50,324
I'm sorry.

1683
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:53,626
I'm sorry, you guys
are great but

1684
01:34:53,628 --> 01:34:55,396
I think I'm done here.

1685
01:35:04,606 --> 01:35:09,009
(phone vibrates)

1686
01:35:12,947 --> 01:35:14,246
Hey, what's up?

1687
01:35:14,248 --> 01:35:17,049
I just wanted to tell you
that I love you...

1688
01:35:17,051 --> 01:35:19,818
And that I also hate you for
being a lesbian.

1689
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,154
Maybe we should talk
about this later.

1690
01:35:22,156 --> 01:35:28,460
Every time I fall for a girl,
she either used to be a lesbian,
becomes a lesbian...

1691
01:35:28,462 --> 01:35:30,497
Or just straight-up
is a lesbian.

1692
01:35:32,266 --> 01:35:33,801
I blame you.

1693
01:35:34,735 --> 01:35:37,869
And maybe Mom
a little too.

1694
01:35:37,871 --> 01:35:42,542
I assume that what you're trying
to say is that because you and I
are so close

1695
01:35:42,544 --> 01:35:44,876
and because you love and
respect me so much

1696
01:35:44,878 --> 01:35:48,113
you think that's why you're
constantly attracted to women
who just so happen

1697
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:49,616
to also be lesbians?

1698
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:50,518
Bingo.

1699
01:35:51,986 --> 01:35:53,919
It's okay for me to laugh
at this, right?

1700
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:55,122
It's absolutely okay.

1701
01:35:56,857 --> 01:35:57,590
I'm guessing this has somethi

1702
01:35:57,592 --> 01:36:00,461
ng to do with that Stella girl?

1703
01:36:01,663 --> 01:36:03,195
You were right.

1704
01:36:03,197 --> 01:36:04,597
I'm sorry.

1705
01:36:04,599 --> 01:36:07,099
Thanks.

1706
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:09,034
Can I give you a call when
I get off work?

1707
01:36:09,036 --> 01:36:12,104
Or maybe if you want,
you can come over for dinner.

1708
01:36:12,106 --> 01:36:13,372
No, I'll be fine.

1709
01:36:13,374 --> 01:36:16,310
Honestly, I just wanted
to tell you I love you.

1710
01:36:17,011 --> 01:36:18,443
I love you too.

1711
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:20,447
And I don't really hate you
for being a lesbian.

1712
01:36:21,616 --> 01:36:23,551
I know you don't. I'll
talk to you later.

1713
01:37:13,568 --> 01:37:15,768
Aaaaa!!!

1714
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:16,870
Shit!

1715
01:37:22,476 --> 01:37:23,509
Hey!

1716
01:37:23,511 --> 01:37:24,577
Hey.

1717
01:37:24,579 --> 01:37:26,612
You the new downstairs roommate?

1718
01:37:26,614 --> 01:37:27,549
Upstairs.

1719
01:37:27,981 --> 01:37:29,551
Cool.

1720
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:36,591
Felix sat slouched in his chair

1721
01:37:38,092 --> 01:37:42,096
writing about nothing
in particular.

1722
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:45,832
All he could think about

1723
01:37:45,834 --> 01:37:48,869
was Stella.

1724
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:29,977
("Hey Suzzanne" by Posse
begins playing)

1725
01:38:53,735 --> 01:38:56,435
(Felix's VOICE OVER)
Interior House Party Night

1726
01:38:56,437 --> 01:39:01,574
Finnegan stands in an archway,
talking to a brunette girl in a
denim jacket.

1727
01:39:01,576 --> 01:39:05,243
She notices the two open
beers in each of his hands.

1728
01:39:05,245 --> 01:39:06,913
- Double fisting, huh? Uh, no.
- Uh,

1729
01:39:06,915 --> 01:39:08,348
Uh no. Uh...

1730
01:39:09,751 --> 01:39:12,752
This one is my friends. I'm just
holding it for him.

1731
01:39:12,754 --> 01:39:19,727
(Felix's VOICE OVER)
The Brunette Girl laughs.

(Felix's VOICE OVER)
Exterior House Party Night

1733
01:39:39,413 --> 01:39:41,781
Finnegan and the Brunette girl

1734
01:39:41,783 --> 01:39:46,017
continue to talk on the
balcony of the back porch

1735
01:39:46,019 --> 01:39:48,656
bathed in moonlight.

1736
01:39:49,356 --> 01:39:51,824
Finnegan is smitten,

1737
01:39:51,826 --> 01:39:55,862
and eventually he asks
her for her name.

1738
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:59,498
The girl lights up a cigarette,
which envelops her

1739
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,705
in a dreamlike veil of smoke.

1740
01:40:19,253 --> 01:40:21,654
Finnegan...

1741
01:40:21,656 --> 01:40:25,325
And Suzanne

1742
01:40:26,426 --> 01:40:31,766
Suzanne turns and walks away

1743
01:40:33,033 --> 01:40:34,167
leaving...

1744
01:40:34,636 --> 01:40:35,803
Finnegan

1745
01:40:37,304 --> 01:40:39,574
alone beneath

1746
01:40:40,675 --> 01:40:44,042
the marquee.

1747
01:40:44,044 --> 01:40:46,581
He looks at the camera

1748
01:40:47,549 --> 01:40:49,717
and shrugs.

1749
01:40:51,084 --> 01:40:52,252
FINNEGAN...

1750
01:40:53,353 --> 01:40:55,823
"Well, I did it."

1751
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,695
Cut to... Black.

1752
01:41:02,664 --> 01:41:06,834
The end.

1753
01:41:11,839 --> 01:41:14,074
Okay.

1754
01:41:16,276 --> 01:41:18,778
Now what?

1755
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:21,616
(Upbeat pop song plays
over montage)

1756
01:41:22,182 --> 01:41:23,415
Perfect!

1757
01:41:23,417 --> 01:41:25,216
Let's have you stand
right here...

1758
01:41:25,218 --> 01:41:26,619
And let's get sound up!

1759
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:28,119
Um yeah...

1760
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:28,888
Ow!

1761
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:30,188
Jeez okay...

1762
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:32,858
Just hold it right there.

1763
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,093
This is that party scene,
scene seven...

1764
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:36,798
Six!

1765
01:41:38,498 --> 01:41:40,300
Hmm... Double-fisting?

1766
01:41:41,569 --> 01:41:42,668
Oh, no.

1767
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:45,605
These are just um... Just
holding it for my friend.

1768
01:41:45,607 --> 01:41:46,841
What kind of movies do you like?

1769
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:50,509
Um... I don't know. All kinds.

1770
01:41:50,511 --> 01:41:53,012
Have you ever watched
any David Lynch?

1771
01:41:53,014 --> 01:41:54,614
Oh yeah, I mean Eraserhead
is like one of my

1772
01:41:54,616 --> 01:41:56,882
favorite movies of all time.

1773
01:41:56,884 --> 01:41:59,417
Eraserhead.. Yes.

1774
01:41:59,419 --> 01:42:00,720
Fuck that baby though.

1775
01:42:00,722 --> 01:42:01,921
(spits)

1776
01:42:01,923 --> 01:42:04,489
Here I got you some
cigarettes for this scene.

1777
01:42:04,491 --> 01:42:06,025
They're real cigarettes?

1778
01:42:06,027 --> 01:42:07,093
During the
audition I asked

1779
01:42:07,095 --> 01:42:09,562
if you would smoke,
and you said that would be fine.

1780
01:42:09,564 --> 01:42:11,496
Yeah you know, now that I
think about it though

1781
01:42:11,498 --> 01:42:14,499
I'd really just prefer if I
didn't have to do that.

1782
01:42:14,501 --> 01:42:16,068
Hold on. Hold for sound.

1783
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:19,404
Is that really an important part
of the character?

1784
01:42:19,406 --> 01:42:20,908
She smokes in like every scene!

1785
01:42:21,909 --> 01:42:23,843
Action.

1786
01:42:23,845 --> 01:42:25,913
Um, do you wanna...

1787
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,282
Play?

1788
01:42:37,692 --> 01:42:39,257
Shit.

1789
01:42:39,259 --> 01:42:40,191
All right, when I call action

1790
01:42:40,193 --> 01:42:41,027
I'm gonna have you, Suzanne, and
you, Nor

1791
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:45,497
ma, start singing along
to that karaoke song.

1792
01:42:45,499 --> 01:42:47,298
What song are we
supposed to sing?

1793
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,934
The song that's in the script.

1794
01:42:48,936 --> 01:42:52,237
- There's a specific song in the
script? - Oooo I did not know
that.

1795
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,439
Oh, my God. How did you
not know that? It's in the
script.

1796
01:42:54,441 --> 01:42:55,941
You read the script!

1797
01:42:55,943 --> 01:42:57,242
Felix, man we got to
get rolling soon.

1798
01:42:57,244 --> 01:42:59,377
We have like 10 minutes before
we're supposed to be wrapped.

1799
01:42:59,379 --> 01:43:01,446
Oh my God, I am freaking out.
I am freaking out!

1800
01:43:01,448 --> 01:43:03,584
Also, why am I
wearing this beard?

1801
01:43:56,571 --> 01:44:01,241
(various chattering)

1802
01:44:29,336 --> 01:44:31,639
What the fuck am I doing?
Holy shit!

1803
01:44:36,376 --> 01:44:38,844
Okay, smile though!

1804
01:44:38,846 --> 01:44:41,013
I made a cool movie. I
made a good movie.

1805
01:44:41,015 --> 01:44:44,415
People are going to
like my movie.

1806
01:44:44,417 --> 01:44:45,520
Yeah.

1807
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:58,766
Yeah! Felix! Woo!

1808
01:45:03,403 --> 01:45:06,841
(laughter)

1809
01:45:14,615 --> 01:45:19,854
(uplifting music begins playing)

1810
01:47:31,786 --> 01:47:33,621
(audience member coughs)

1811
01:47:36,691 --> 01:47:38,926
Uh... Thank you.

1812
01:47:40,127 --> 01:47:44,196
Thank you all for
coming to my movie.

1813
01:47:44,198 --> 01:47:49,835
Um, if you don't have
any questions feel free to...

1814
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:53,806
If you have any questions
or comments, feel free to...

1815
01:47:53,808 --> 01:47:55,941
All right... Yep.

1816
01:47:55,943 --> 01:47:59,645
Thanks for... Thanks for
coming anyway.

1817
01:47:59,647 --> 01:48:01,180
Does anybody have any...

1818
01:48:01,182 --> 01:48:01,849
Felix!

1819
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:07,254
Fuck you!

1820
01:48:25,272 --> 01:48:27,274
Okay.

1821
01:48:34,615 --> 01:48:37,084
Thanks for coming to my movie!

1822
01:48:58,205 --> 01:48:59,240
Shit.

1823
01:49:00,441 --> 01:49:02,908
I just don't know how I'm
supposed to feel about it.

1824
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:05,477
I'm sure he wasn't
trying to hurt your feelings.

1825
01:49:05,479 --> 01:49:06,678
Yeah, but about Nora?

1826
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,647
That's not fair to her. What
about the way...

1827
01:49:08,649 --> 01:49:10,149
Hey!

1828
01:49:10,151 --> 01:49:11,952
Hey.

1829
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,687
I'll see you at home?

1830
01:49:14,188 --> 01:49:14,889
Yeah.

1831
01:49:20,227 --> 01:49:23,030
You really made it seem like I
was a huge pothead.

1832
01:49:25,032 --> 01:49:26,665
Those were just
characters.

1833
01:49:26,667 --> 01:49:28,434
I know.

1834
01:49:28,436 --> 01:49:31,338
But good luck trying to
convince her of that.

1835
01:49:37,678 --> 01:49:42,047
You know, you didn't have to
make a whole movie about it.

1836
01:49:42,049 --> 01:49:44,616
You could have just told me.

1837
01:49:44,618 --> 01:49:46,919
Seeing those
characters up there...

1838
01:49:46,921 --> 01:49:50,289
Seeing us up there...

1839
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:52,793
That was so inconsiderate.

1840
01:49:55,096 --> 01:49:56,895
And with Nora sitting
right next to me

1841
01:49:56,897 --> 01:49:59,798
that was really embarrassing.

1842
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:05,270
I can see how that might be
a little uncomfortable.

1843
01:50:05,272 --> 01:50:08,040
And what was with the
bearded girl?

1844
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:11,777
The one who was obviously
supposed to be Nora.

1845
01:50:11,779 --> 01:50:13,412
Was that some kind of gay joke?

1846
01:50:13,414 --> 01:50:16,348
No! No, absolutely not!

1847
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:18,951
Have you ever seen "Die Hard"
or uh...

1848
01:50:18,953 --> 01:50:22,287
You know, David Cronenberg's
remake of "The Fly"?

1849
01:50:22,289 --> 01:50:23,355
Of course I have.

1850
01:50:23,357 --> 01:50:25,858
So I was rewatching
both of those.

1851
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:28,827
And you know, I realized in
the eighties...

1852
01:50:28,829 --> 01:50:31,531
Any time someone important in a
movie had a beard...

1853
01:50:31,533 --> 01:50:33,701
They're always a bad guy.

1854
01:50:35,736 --> 01:50:38,003
So that's...

1855
01:50:38,005 --> 01:50:40,774
Why I gave Nora a beard.

1856
01:50:41,275 --> 01:50:43,844
(laughs)

1857
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:51,385
Are you mad at me for making it?

1858
01:50:55,624 --> 01:50:57,992
I don't know.

1859
01:50:58,759 --> 01:50:59,825
No?

1860
01:50:59,827 --> 01:51:00,492
Good... Beca

1861
01:51:00,494 --> 01:51:02,863
use I needed to make it.

1862
01:51:03,931 --> 01:51:05,164
I really did, you know?

1863
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:08,869
I tried to finish writing my
other movie but

1864
01:51:09,571 --> 01:51:11,336
I just couldn't.

1865
01:51:11,338 --> 01:51:14,441
This was all I could
think about.

1866
01:51:17,678 --> 01:51:19,680
I like that you shot it on VHS.

1867
01:51:20,781 --> 01:51:23,682
Really?

1868
01:51:23,684 --> 01:51:27,755
You know, you made a comment
once about nostalgia.

1869
01:51:28,923 --> 01:51:32,191
And how your mind
practically plays back

1870
01:51:32,193 --> 01:51:34,195
all of your memories on VHS.

1871
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:39,066
You said something about um...

1872
01:51:44,305 --> 01:51:45,837
Yeah! Um...

1873
01:51:45,839 --> 01:51:48,907
About "Having to adjust
the tracking

1874
01:51:48,909 --> 01:51:53,080
on all the spots where the
magnetic tape of your memory
fails you."

1875
01:51:54,782 --> 01:51:56,483
I just thought that
was beautiful.

1876
01:51:57,851 --> 01:52:01,288
So that's why I did it.

1877
01:52:04,559 --> 01:52:07,859
How come you
waited so long

1878
01:52:07,861 --> 01:52:11,598
to tell me that you and Nora
had started seeing each other?

1879
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,601
How come you pretended
like you were my friend

1880
01:52:14,603 --> 01:52:17,436
when you were really just
trying to get me to fall for
you?

1881
01:52:17,438 --> 01:52:20,272
Okay. Tell me that's not what
you actually think.

1882
01:52:20,274 --> 01:52:22,276
I wasn't pretending to
be your friend.

1883
01:52:23,077 --> 01:52:25,043
I wanted to be
your friend.

1884
01:52:25,045 --> 01:52:26,845
When we established right away

1885
01:52:26,847 --> 01:52:29,181
that that's all it was
ever going to be.

1886
01:52:29,183 --> 01:52:31,085
That was a
dream come true.

1887
01:52:31,752 --> 01:52:32,751
But then, you know

1888
01:52:32,753 --> 01:52:36,056
when we started hanging out, it
was all so effortless.

1889
01:52:36,658 --> 01:52:37,456
I just

1890
01:52:37,458 --> 01:52:40,158
I loved being around you.

1891
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,460
The more I got to know you

1892
01:52:41,462 --> 01:52:45,097
the more I realized
how much I love

1893
01:52:45,099 --> 01:52:48,269
absolutely everything about you.

1894
01:52:49,803 --> 01:52:53,005
And at first, you know,
it was pure

1895
01:52:53,007 --> 01:52:57,342
legitimate friend love.

1896
01:52:57,344 --> 01:53:00,312
I mean, honestly it wasn't
until my sister

1897
01:53:00,314 --> 01:53:03,248
and her girlfriend tried
to set me up with one of their
friends.

1898
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:06,151
You never told me your
sister was gay.

1899
01:53:06,153 --> 01:53:08,556
Um... well... she is.

1900
01:53:09,857 --> 01:53:11,658
She's very gay.

1901
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:11,923
Yeah.

1902
01:53:11,925 --> 01:53:13,025
Anyway, so

1903
01:53:13,027 --> 01:53:16,629
I went on this double
date, and it was bogus.

1904
01:53:16,631 --> 01:53:19,133
And the whole time I just
kept comparing the person...

1905
01:53:20,535 --> 01:53:21,569
To you.

1906
01:53:23,605 --> 01:53:25,370
I wish you would have told me.

1907
01:53:25,372 --> 01:53:29,542
Well I was going to. But I mean,
that was the night that you told
me that

1908
01:53:29,544 --> 01:53:32,277
you and Nora started
seeing each other.

1909
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:34,982
And even though it
broke my heart.

1910
01:53:36,884 --> 01:53:38,884
I tried so hard

1911
01:53:38,886 --> 01:53:40,588
to be friends with both of you.

1912
01:53:41,889 --> 01:53:43,955
Because I just couldn't
bear the idea

1913
01:53:43,957 --> 01:53:46,091
of not having you in my life.

1914
01:53:46,093 --> 01:53:49,061
In whatever capacity.

1915
01:53:49,063 --> 01:53:51,531
You truly are...

1916
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:55,334
Maybe the best friend
I've ever had.

1917
01:53:55,336 --> 01:53:56,769
I don't know.

1918
01:53:56,771 --> 01:54:01,543
Maybe it was dishonest of me
not to tell you how I felt.

1919
01:54:02,777 --> 01:54:06,044
But also, maybe it wasn't.

1920
01:54:06,046 --> 01:54:09,383
But if it was, I'm sorry.

1921
01:54:13,053 --> 01:54:15,788
I was afraid to tell you
about me and Nora.

1922
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:19,391
I thought maybe you wouldn't
want to hang out with me
anymore...

1923
01:54:19,393 --> 01:54:22,427
And then I'd lose you.
As a friend.

1924
01:54:22,429 --> 01:54:25,263
You realize that's absurd,
right?

1925
01:54:25,265 --> 01:54:28,768
It's not the first time
it's happened.

1926
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:31,604
I really liked you, Felix.

1927
01:54:31,606 --> 01:54:34,206
And eventually I had
a feeling that

1928
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:36,341
you might have been like,
I don't know

1929
01:54:36,343 --> 01:54:40,045
falling for me
or whatever.

1930
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:43,250
But I didn't know how to bring
it up. Or if I even wanted to.

1931
01:54:44,652 --> 01:54:47,452
I thought maybe if I just
stopped talking to you

1932
01:54:47,454 --> 01:54:51,056
then maybe you'd stop trying
to talk to me too.

1933
01:54:51,058 --> 01:54:53,726
And it'd never have to
be addressed.

1934
01:54:53,728 --> 01:54:57,398
We'd forget about it and each
other, and just go on with our
lives.

1935
01:54:59,133 --> 01:55:01,402
We could just blame it on
fate or whatever.

1936
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:05,571
You know, unfortunately

1937
01:55:05,573 --> 01:55:07,941
I can't forget about
you that easily.

1938
01:55:09,611 --> 01:55:12,279
You've made far too big of
an impact on me.

1939
01:55:14,314 --> 01:55:16,684
Stella I think you're an
amazing human being.

1940
01:55:18,318 --> 01:55:22,387
You know, frankly I think you're
the cat's bananas.

1941
01:55:22,389 --> 01:55:25,858
I think you're
amazing too.

1942
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:27,760
I don't know that I've ever
had a friend that

1943
01:55:27,762 --> 01:55:30,630
I click with the way that I
click with you.

1944
01:55:30,632 --> 01:55:32,931
But I can't be your friend if
you can't handle me

1945
01:55:32,933 --> 01:55:35,603
being with someone else.

1946
01:55:43,511 --> 01:55:46,913
Nora's probably pretty mad
at me, isn't she?

1947
01:55:46,915 --> 01:55:50,685
Did you not see her
storm out of the auditorium?

1948
01:55:52,252 --> 01:55:54,722
Yeah, I guess I did.

1949
01:55:57,458 --> 01:56:00,093
Would you tell her I'm sorry?

1950
01:56:02,062 --> 01:56:04,599
I will.

1951
01:56:07,234 --> 01:56:10,703
Hey, maybe we could all hang
out later this week.

1952
01:56:10,705 --> 01:56:14,740
The three of us could go see a
movie or ride go-karts or
something.

1953
01:56:14,742 --> 01:56:16,041
I don't know why I said that

1954
01:56:16,043 --> 01:56:17,545
I've never ridden a
go-kart in my life.

1955
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:20,111
Maybe I just really want to.

1956
01:56:20,113 --> 01:56:22,047
Felix?

1957
01:56:22,049 --> 01:56:25,520
We should probably give
it some time.

1958
01:56:28,088 --> 01:56:31,058
That makes sense.

1959
01:56:34,094 --> 01:56:36,664
Friends?

1960
01:56:53,013 --> 01:56:56,250
Goodbye, Felix.

1961
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:05,058
I'll see you...

1962
01:57:07,027 --> 01:57:10,798
Later.

1963
01:57:25,379 --> 01:57:28,282
Well... I did it.

1964
01:57:51,839 --> 01:57:58,245
(synth pop music plays
over credits)
