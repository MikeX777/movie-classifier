1
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,409
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!

2
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,340
Here, man! Money! Five euros, take it!

3
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,217
Stop it!

4
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,258
Stay there!

5
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,969
Go away, man!

6
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,416
If I have to say it again I'll hit you.

7
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,172
Go away and count to a thousand!

8
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,014
Watch out, you'll lose all your teeth.

9
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,893
Someone's coming!

10
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,578
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

11
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,018
Up to mischief again?

12
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,129
He wasn't doing anything, really.

13
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,137
Who do you think you are?

14
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,896
Look, she does what I say!

15
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,936
Let's go. It's late.

16
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Mom!

17
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,571
Mom, the saucepan's burning!

18
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,493
I forgot about the saucepan.

19
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,619
Sit down, the saucepan's burnt.
But I took it off.

20
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,852
What would I do without you.
You're such a good boy.

21
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,014
The bus is coming.

22
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,009
Do you have any proof
that your husband died in the war'?

23
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,055
She says that when he was killed
we were already in Austria.

24
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,940
Is there a death certificate?
- No.

25
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,498
I read that you still have grandparents.

26
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,334
Do your parents still live in Chechnya?
- Yes.

27
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,657
Can't they get proof, a death certificate?

28
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,813
She doesn't dare to...

29
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,250
She's scared they'll get into trouble.

30
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,059
And she doesn't want that.

31
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,215
That's bad. You need evidence,
so the judge believes

32
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,249
that your husband is really dead.

33
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,100
What do you know about his death?

34
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,530
He was a war hero.
- What does that mean?

35
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,171
He fought against the Russians.

36
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,532
Do you know more about that?
- That's all he told us.

37
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,771
There's no way at all to get proof?

38
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,694
We've been through this a thousand times.

39
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,777
It's in the files.
- I know.

40
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,899
But I have to prepare you for the hearing.

41
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,456
If you say it like that
at the asylum court

42
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,489
it won't be detailed enough
and the result will be negative.

43
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,412
Can you translate that?

44
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,531
She asks what we should do.

45
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,451
You already have subsidiary protection.

46
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,251
If your application is rejected this time,
all is not lost, but it would be better...

47
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,417
To change to a Red-White-Red Card
integration in Austria is crucial.

48
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,889
You speak German,
but you have to improve.

49
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,656
Try to speak more,
do another German course.

50
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,495
Speak more, practice more.
Don't use Ramasan as an interpreter.

51
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,413
You can speak yourself.

52
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,137
Do you have a new boyfriend, a husband?

53
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
A relationship?

54
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,611
She has female friends,

55
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,297
but boyfriend... No.

56
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,370
Ask your mother if she has a boyfriend.

57
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,095
Go on, ask her.

58
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,774
What does she mean?

59
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,136
If I have a brother.

60
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,776
A brother'?

61
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
No.

62
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
No.

63
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,219
Sit up straight.

64
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,769
Masud, can I have the blue one?

65
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,977
Let's play soccer with them.

66
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,330
Excuse me. Can I have the ball?

67
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,577
Are you a Chechen?
- Yes.

68
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,697
What's your name?
- Ramasan.

69
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,853
You speak German well.

70
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,219
Who is your father?

71
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,693
My father is dead.

72
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,100
Okay, but watch where you boys kick it.

73
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Thanks.

74
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,657
Ramasan, will you buy me this?

75
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,369
No. Put it back, lman.
We have no money.

76
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,898
We'll buy it later, okay?

77
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,256
I want this.
- No, put it back.

78
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,855
Mom didn't give us money for that.

79
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,977
What are you doing?

80
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,370
What are you doing? Stop it!

81
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,617
Put it all back.

82
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,578
Stop it, will you!

83
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,573
Hurry UP-

84
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,094
Let me see.

85
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,899
Come on.

86
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,932
Come on. We're going home.

87
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,137
I don't want to.
- But I do.

88
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,493
Come.

89
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,897
Let's stay a bit longer.

90
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,174
This is Ramasan, lman and Rosa.

91
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,174
They've grown so much.

92
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,020
Hello.
- Hello.

93
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,936
Take the girls to the other room
and put on a DVD.

94
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,329
Come on!

95
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,980
Put this one in.

96
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,690
How long have you been here?
- Since 2006.

97
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,778
Have you got papers'?
- Yes.

98
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,613
Who's that?
- A friend of your father's.

99
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,371
He's brought a few things
that belonged to him.

100
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,573
What's this?

101
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,413
Do you recognize anyone?

102
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,939
That's us, isn't it?

103
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,536
It's a photo of you.
Your father always had it with him.

104
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,570
Come and sit down.

105
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,732
This is your father's watch.

106
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,732
He wanted you to have it.

107
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,893
Does it fit'?
- It's a bit too big.

108
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,734
Let me see.

109
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,533
It should be okay now.

110
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,652
Now it fits.
- Thank you.

111
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,173
It doesn't work.

112
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,175
I don't know what's wrong with it.

113
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,138
We can have a look at it later.

114
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,929
<i>Ea'?</i>

115
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,694
No, thanks. I must go.

116
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,375
Let me know if you need anything.

117
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,537
Ramasan knows where I live.

118
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,578
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

119
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,050
Hello, Mom. How are you'?

120
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,454
Thanks. Everyone's fine.

121
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,176
I wanted to ask you
if you've ever heard of a man called Isa.

122
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,331
One of Hassan's friends.

123
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,130
He came to see us and said

124
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,213
he was a friend of Hassan's,

125
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,974
and he brought some of his things.

126
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,536
A photo and his watch.

127
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,817
No, I haven't either.

128
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,619
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

129
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,534
What are you doing?

130
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
Hello.

131
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,212
How are you'?
- Good.

132
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,531
I need two pieces of wood like this.

133
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,179
Will you help me'?

134
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,252
See if you can find any.

135
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,615
Like this?
- Exactly.

136
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,218
Where did you get it?
- Over there.

137
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,293
Did you do that in Chechnya too?

138
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,738
Were you a craftsman?

139
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,412
I had lots of jobs.

140
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,859
Could my father do that too'?

141
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,017
Don't you remember him at all?

142
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,379
I was little when he died.
I don't remember much.

143
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,260
Did you hurt your hand in the war'?

144
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,491
Yes, I was injured back home.

145
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,220
Were you really in the war with my father?

146
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,416
We walked many paths together.

147
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,219
Don't you believe me?

148
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,133
My mother says

149
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,371
I'm not to trust strangers.

150
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,130
You should listen to your mother.

151
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:17,940
Hello.
- Good day.

152
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:19,169
Hello.
- Good day.

153
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,889
I've got a watch that doesn't work.

154
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,178
Could you have a look at it?
- Of course.

155
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,373
It's a lovely old Russian model.

156
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,130
What's that golden thing?

157
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,494
That.

158
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,933
It's a clock movement.

159
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,534
Did you make it?

160
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,214
No.

161
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,100
They're usually inside table clocks.

162
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,859
The battery is dead.

163
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,899
We'll have to change it.
It costs six euros.

164
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,699
Shall we do it?

165
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,533
I'll do it myself.

166
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,135
Could I have another look
at the battery?

167
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,214
This size, but...

168
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,300
Let's hope
you don't break something else.

169
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,020
Ramasan!

170
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,369
Come here.

171
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,813
Let's talk later.

172
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,289
How are you'?
- Fine.

173
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,292
Working hard at school?
- Yes.

174
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,338
What's happening at school?

175
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,655
Nothing special.

176
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,811
Are you behaving badly?
- No.

177
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,529
Behave well, Ramasan.

178
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,540
Tell me if you need anything.

179
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,138
I'm therefor my family.
We manage okay.

180
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,217
Look, Bekhan, he's a real man.

181
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,894
Yes, a real man.

182
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,249
You see, that's our future.

183
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,534
Off you go, then.

184
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,170
Goodbye.
- Ramasan, wait!

185
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,370
I never see you at the mosque.

186
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,449
You're old enough, 11 or 12...
You're grown up.

187
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,254
I'll come next time.

188
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,219
Bekhan, make sure he does come.

189
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,939
Good, off you go.

190
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,293
I was going to jump high.
- I'll do a backflip!

191
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,133
That was no good.

192
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,692
I should have jumped higher.

193
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,220
The other mattress too!
The yellow one!

194
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,217
Was that a backflip?

195
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,371
That was crap, man.

196
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,978
Stop that. Sit down.

197
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,295
<i>Man, sit down when you're mm m.</i>

198
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,414
Stop that, Iman.

199
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,818
What are you doing?

200
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,212
Can't you keep still
till I've finished?

201
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,050
Look, she's broken it.

202
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,019
She's jumping around like a goat.
- Stop it, Mom.

203
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,375
You're scaring her.
- I'm not scaring her.

204
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,412
She doesn't listen to you either.

205
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,413
Sit down.
You've got into enough mischief.

206
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,889
Get your hands off me.

207
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,171
Give me the money back now!

208
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,859
Do you think I'll give it to you
if you shout?

209
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,611
Hello.
- Hi.

210
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,650
Our hairdryer is broken.

211
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,857
Can you fix it'?

212
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,536
Did someone drop it'?
- Yes.

213
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,050
I'll have a look at it later. Wait here.

214
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,659
Shame on you!

215
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,131
What's all this noise about?

216
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,860
Like children!
Fighting in public...

217
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,610
I saw a sofa back there.

218
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,977
Will you help me carry it'?

219
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,455
What's up?

220
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,418
Why did you stop?
- No reason.

221
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,054
Is that it'?

222
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,095
No, it's further over there.

223
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,730
That one's too old and broken.
Leave it.

224
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,453
What's wrong with you'?

225
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,173
I don't want to go in any further.

226
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,020
Why not'?
Did your mother forbid you to'?

227
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,814
There's a wolf in there.

228
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,212
What are you talking about?
There are no wolves here.

229
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,337
Besides, I've got my knife.

230
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,858
If we see a wolf
I'll show him...

231
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,774
All right.

232
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,694
Here it is.

233
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,654
Wait, step aside.

234
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,658
It's broken.

235
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,457
Yes, it's too broken.

236
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,213
You see, there are no wolves here
yet you were afraid.

237
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,097
I hear them at night.

238
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,977
How do you know they're wolves,
not dogs?

239
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,451
I can tell by their call.

240
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,213
They are wolves.

241
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,770
I hear them every night.

242
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,810
I can't sleep at night either.

243
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,978
Are you scared of them?

244
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,816
Wolves aren't that dangerous.

245
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,411
Humans are dangerous.

246
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,892
Have you ever done it?

247
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,574
What?

248
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,854
Killed a wolf with a knife.

249
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,214
No, I have never killed a wolf.

250
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,253
What about a person?

251
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,259
Where's the white one?
- Hands off!

252
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,493
None for you. Go away.

253
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,936
I said just look, don't take it out.

254
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,178
Go away! Didn't you hear me?

255
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,371
It's not for blacks.
- Go away.

256
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,700
Go away, man.
You're not allowed to look.

257
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,376
Go away, blackie!

258
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,017
I'm not showing you. Go away!

259
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,570
I'll show you when we're over there.

260
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,458
Let me look!

261
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,657
The black guy is leaving anyway.

262
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,653
Look, I'll show you.

263
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,531
Who's that?
- I don't know.

264
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,894
Let's see who can punch harder.

265
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,614
Come on.

266
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,851
I'll punch the top part, okay'?

267
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,533
Now kick.

268
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,417
What are you doing?
Are you now Karate Kid or what?

269
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,049
What's going on?
- Nothing.

270
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,416
Your heads are full of nonsense.

271
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,333
So?
- Go to the playground.

272
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,531
The playground is too small.

273
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,331
Then play near the playground.

274
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,140
Not in this area!
- Why not? It's public.

275
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,135
People get annoyed.
You kids fool around and are noisy.

276
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,894
Who cares?
- I care! It's not public!

277
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,017
It doesn't belong to you.

278
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,854
No, but I'm paid
to keep things in order here.

279
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,899
The passers-by feel harassed by you.

280
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,179
So?
- Not '80'.

281
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,300
But that's our hobby!
- Go to the playground.

282
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,617
Off you go, go on!

283
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,334
Hey, let go of me!

284
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,130
I'm just patting your shoulder
because you're such a good boy.

285
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,657
You're making me dirty.
- No, my hands are very clean.

286
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,971
Cool it! And shut your trap!

287
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,697
DIGGER THEME PARK
KIDS ON STAGE

288
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,132
How much?
- It's really expensive. 60 euros.

289
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,053
Per hour.

290
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,809
And look at that one.

291
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,016
It's not that big.

292
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,173
That one's bigger.

293
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,931
That one has bigger buckets,
but the other one has a longer crane.

294
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,138
Look what they're doing.

295
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,377
Look at those idiots!

296
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,972
Look at that naked guy!

297
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,453
Yuck.

298
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,653
What are you doing, man?
Are you psycho?

299
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,574
I swear, you've totally lost it.

300
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,811
You gypsy!
- That was awesome.

301
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,413
Swear you'll never do it again.
- But it was fun.

302
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,336
It was fun,
but I'm totally out of breath, man.

303
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
So?

304
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,374
We had to run for ages because of you.
- So'?

305
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,850
Why did you scratch the car?

306
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,420
I don't know.

307
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,574
Stay here for a while.
I'll be right back.

308
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,697
Don't go away.

309
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,976
Hey, I'm flying!

310
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,130
Faster!

311
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,813
Get down.

312
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,177
Have you been shopping?

313
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,215
Come on, my girl.

314
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,734
Give me that.
- No, I can carry it.

315
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,813
Give it to me. You look after the girls.
- No.

316
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,415
Take your sisters.
- All right.

317
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,660
Come on.

318
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,570
Iman, Rosa, play over there.

319
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:11,217
Let them stay.
They're not bothering us.

320
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,139
May I try?

321
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,051
You may, but can you do it?

322
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,818
I think so.

323
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,569
Here, try it.
But be careful.

324
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,696
Just cut the little ones off.

325
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,739
What a beautiful knife.

326
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,338
Start here and go downwards.

327
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,458
Careful you don't hurt yourself.

328
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,020
Do you want the knife?

329
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,412
Sure. I like it.
- You can keep it.

330
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,379
But be careful with it.

331
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,738
Don't play with it
in front of the other kids.

332
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,774
Only use it for working.
And be careful.

333
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,769
Munasar, you haven't got any games.

334
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,017
Are you at home?

335
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,456
Hello.
- Hi, Ramasan.

336
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,657
Can I come in?

337
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,613
Is your mother at home?
- Yes, she's here.

338
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,931
Can you call her'?

339
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,580
Mom, lsa's here with the hairdryer.

340
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,209
Oh, is he? Wait a moment.

341
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,811
What are you looking at'?

342
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,180
I see. You don't miss a thing.

343
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,410
Come on.
Let's not keep him waiting.

344
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,812
Hello.
- How are you all?

345
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,414
Fine, thank you.

346
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,697
I've fixed the hairdryer

347
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,778
and brought it back to you.

348
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,011
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.

349
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,133
Not a problem. ll wasn't hard.
Tell me if I can help.

350
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,134
I will.
- I have to go. Goodbye.

351
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,854
Goodbye.

352
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,252
It's not always easy,

353
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,699
the question of
"to marry or not to marry"...

354
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,256
Marriage is good.

355
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,174
In Afghanistan,
not married, not speak together.

356
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,060
Only family decide, family decide all.

357
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,209
Aminat, you're so quiet today.

358
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,295
How did you meet your husband?

359
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,056
You didn't want to'?
- No.

360
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,459
You mean, the man,

361
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,499
your husband, saw you at some point...

362
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,017
and said, "I want her"?
- Yes.

363
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,049
And then he came to your house
and took you away with him?

364
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,211
I was home with my siblings
when he came,

365
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,929
and lsaid, "No, please!"

366
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,570
But he was with car and two friends,

367
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,979
and just took me. Like, stole me.

368
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,095
I scream, "Please, don't!"

369
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,331
But... that's how it was.

370
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,013
But did you call the police?

371
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,054
He can't just come and take you!

372
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,940
That's tradition in Chechnya.

373
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,933
It's normal.
- Yes, it's normal.

374
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,453
If I say no, there is fight.

375
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,135
So if you'd said,
"I don't want to marry you"

376
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,933
the families would've had a dispute?
- Yes.

377
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,218
But you also have children, right?

378
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,889
Three children.
- How does that work?

379
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,499
It's just like that.

380
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,459
Did you love him at some point?

381
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,733
Difficult.

382
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,974
I told you to be careful!

383
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,812
Now he's getting yelled at.

384
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,889
By his boss.

385
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,495
Shut up!
- Be quiet, will you!

386
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,859
Isa is afraid, I think.

387
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,339
Load this up and get it over there!

388
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,494
See you.

389
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,340
You should be glad
you have a job!

390
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,978
We've been waiting for you.

391
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,578
Hello.

392
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:01,775
Like we said, your dispute is over,
I expect reconciliation between you.

393
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,978
Give each other a firm handshake.

394
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,860
Forgive me, I'll do my best.
- Shake hands.

395
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,699
I want to apologize.
- Behave yourselves.

396
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,615
With God's help
we will never again lose our temper.

397
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,453
May it please Allah.

398
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,378
May God be pleased with you.

399
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,500
If the boys here see you,

400
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,971
they will do the same.

401
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,178
You were a bad example.

402
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,851
If you don't mind,
I'll go home now with Ramasan.

403
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,336
Goodbye.

404
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,730
That's how it is.

405
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,812
You must not behave badly.

406
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,060
I won't.

407
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,649
Your father was an honorable man.

408
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,177
Don't ruin his reputation.

409
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,058
Understood?
- Yes.

410
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,813
Hello.
- Hello, Ramasan.

411
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,173
How are you'?
- Good.

412
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:14,580
Are you hungry?
- A little.

413
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,969
Are you hungry?
- A little.

414
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,572
I have some meat.
Shall we make a shashlik?

415
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,731
Help me collect some wood!

416
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,571
Do you have your knife'?
- Yes.

417
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,413
Give it to me.

418
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,653
Why don't you pray at the mosque?

419
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,329
There are too many people there for me.

420
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,137
But praying once at the mosque
is like praying 27 times alone. It's good.

421
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:22,740
That's true.

422
00:55:22,741 --> 00:55:23,775
That's true.

423
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,374
But...

424
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,977
what's most important

425
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,690
is that you pray with a pure heart.

426
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,100
Who killed my father'?

427
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,100
Who killed my father'?

428
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,779
How was he killed?

429
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,529
Why do you ask?

430
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,530
As soon as I'm grown up,
I'll avenge his murder!

431
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,857
You don't have to do that.

432
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,650
Take care of your family instead.

433
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,500
We didn't do everything right either.

434
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,376
Your father and I made many mistakes.

435
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,016
More out of stupidity than courage.

436
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,420
You might be stupid,
but my father wasn't!

437
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,819
Don't speak of him like that!

438
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,980
Don't speak of him like that!

439
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,849
I didn't say he was stupid. Ramasan!

440
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,577
I'm going in first!

441
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,616
Shit, it's locked.
Let's move on.

442
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:52,980
No, man!
- The door's locked!

443
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:55,335
No, man!
- The door's locked!

444
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,777
There's a good view from up here.

445
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,134
Look at this!

446
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,132
The digger's unlocked!

447
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,177
Come on!

448
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,659
You go first.

449
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,216
Move along.
- Only big guys are allowed to sit.

450
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,578
No key here either.

451
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,779
Hey, do you see that white door?

452
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,770
Hey, do you see that white door?

453
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,693
That's where all the keys are.

454
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,170
When me and Askhab were here
we saw a man.

455
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,013
Yeah, let's go.

456
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,057
Shit, it's locked.

457
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,700
Hey stupid,
it opens outwards not inwards!

458
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:50,169
Hey stupid,
it opens outwards not inwards!

459
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,570
You'll break your foot. Move.

460
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,256
You need tools for that, man!

461
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,014
Your foot won't do it.
- Askhab's right.

462
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,739
What's he doing here?
- Why didn't you pick up the girls?

463
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:36,098
Isa brought them home.

464
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:39,173
Where were you?
What have you been up to?

465
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,774
Nothing happened.

466
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:41,940
Who did you fight with?
You're up to no good again.

467
00:59:41,941 --> 00:59:46,093
Who did you fight with?
You're up to no good again.

468
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,857
I told you
you shouldn't hang around with those kids!

469
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,329
How did you hurt yourself?

470
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,378
Those kids are a bad influence!

471
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,859
I've told him so often
not to hang around with them.

472
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,419
I've told him so often
not to hang around with them.

473
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,255
You're not a child anymore.
Why don't you listen to your mother?

474
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,369
You're not my father!
You can't tell me anything!

475
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:36,660
Now I can kill you better.

476
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:38,776
Now I can kill you better.

477
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,093
Stop it, you're getting me wet!

478
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,298
I have pliers at home too.

479
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,577
You know that sharp thing?

480
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,733
Seriously. I have one of those...

481
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,054
We need pliers.
- Yes, I have some at home.

482
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,496
Crowbar...
- I have that too.

483
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,019
No, you don't.
- I do. Want to bet?

484
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,380
No, you don't.
- I do. Want to bet?

485
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,936
At home you have two siblings
you have to look after.

486
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,295
That's all.

487
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,133
Shut your mouth, man.

488
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,131
Ramasan, let's go.

489
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:17,460
Knock it off, be quiet!

490
01:01:17,461 --> 01:01:18,939
Knock it off, be quiet!

491
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,896
What are you doing?
- I said, stop it.

492
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,379
Can't we go now?

493
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,380
Can't we go now?

494
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,013
Come on, let's go!

495
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,819
What are you doing?
- Shut up!

496
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,049
What are you doing?
- Shut up!

497
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,739
Will that be everything?

498
01:01:58,740 --> 01:01:59,740
Will that be everything?

499
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,374
6 euros 29. Are you paying cash'?

500
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:12,180
3 euros 71 change.

501
01:02:12,181 --> 01:02:13,773
3 euros 71 change.

502
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,489
The receipt?
- Yes, please.

503
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,458
Bye.
- Hold on a second.

504
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,974
What did you pay for'?

505
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,570
A battery.
- A battery?

506
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,099
May I look in your backpack?
- Sure, go ahead.

507
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,900
May I look in your backpack?
- Sure, go ahead.

508
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,699
Thanks.

509
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,009
You showed me everything, right?
- Yes.

510
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,773
Are they your sisters?
- Yes.

511
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,694
Will you give me
your sister's backpack?

512
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:49,375
Let me look at the other one first, okay'?

513
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,259
Thank you.

514
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,851
You didn't hide anything, did you?

515
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,900
What's this?

516
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:07,935
What's this?

517
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,372
But you didn't pay for this!

518
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,340
Well...

519
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,340
Well...

520
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:27,172
If you won't work with me,
it's going to be difficult, you know?

521
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,370
I heard your sisters were there too?

522
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,617
Why?
- I picked them up from daycare.

523
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,174
Does he pick them up often?

524
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,138
I work.

525
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,700
When I work,
he picks them up from daycare.

526
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:51,375
When I work,
he picks them up from daycare.

527
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,890
Then you have to take care of them?

528
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,336
Yeah, but only for a couple of hours.

529
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,012
Until she gets home.

530
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,620
So you decided
to take them to go stealing

531
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:03,531
So you decided
to take them to go stealing

532
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,214
in the hardware store.

533
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:15,059
You have an asylum case pending, right?

534
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,620
You have an asylum case pending, right?

535
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,170
So you're waiting on a decision.

536
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,896
Ramasan, you have to realize
that these things matter.

537
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,410
If you break the law in Austria,

538
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,732
it certainly won't help the case.

539
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,936
You're responsible for your kids,

540
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,093
you need to make sure
they are looked after.

541
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,809
And you're responsible

542
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,976
tor not getting into trouble, okay?

543
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,777
I look after my children.

544
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,219
But you can't when you go to work.

545
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,217
I already have a grown son.

546
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,492
Does he live with you too'?

547
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,859
I mean...
- You mean Ramasan?

548
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:56,980
I mean...
- You mean Ramasan?

549
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,579
He's not grown up.

550
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,538
I also looked after my...

551
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,532
But he's still a child.

552
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,578
Eleven years is old enough...

553
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:07,130
Not in Austria, definitely not.

554
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,779
You can be happy about that, otherwise
you might go to iail for shoplifting.

555
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,340
You can be happy about that, otherwise
you might go to iail for shoplifting.

556
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,696
I want to support you, okay'?

557
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:20,891
Do you have any relatives
who could look after the two little ones?

558
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,175
No.

559
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,491
Friends? Acquaintances?

560
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,896
Isa could help us out.

561
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,492
Nobody, unfortunately. They're all...

562
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,058
in Chechnya.

563
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,858
Ramasan!

564
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,531
What was with the police?
- Nothing.

565
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,253
Tell us.
- What was with the police?

566
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:04,016
Did you rat on us?
- No, I'm not a rat!

567
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,140
You ratted on us, didn't you'?

568
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,371
Did you? Tell us now.

569
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:12,294
No!
- What did the police say'?

570
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,417
Does your mom know'?

571
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,334
Don't bug me!
- Yeah, your mom knows.

572
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,739
Did she beat you?
- Shut up.

573
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,493
I know she did!

574
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,094
Get lost!
- You get lost!

575
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,851
What are you doing there?

576
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,137
What's your problem?

577
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,093
Put the knife away.

578
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,532
What's wrong?

579
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,339
What happened?

580
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,219
Knock it off!

581
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,734
What is this?

582
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,135
Do whatever you were planning to do.

583
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,491
Hello.

584
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,174
Sit down.

585
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,937
What's wrong, Ramasan?

586
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,294
Nothing.

587
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,098
Tell me, or else I can't help you.

588
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:53,853
Nothing happened.

589
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,058
I heard what you did.

590
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,450
Tell me what happened.
- Nothing.

591
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,294
Nothing? You're lying!

592
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,456
I know something happened.
The Youth Office is after you!

593
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,816
You're not a good example
for your sisters.

594
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,615
This is what happens
when you have no father.

595
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,697
Your mother <i>needs</i> support.

596
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,692
She needs help.

597
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,897
You're no help to her yet.

598
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,770
We don't need anyone.
- You're talking back!

599
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,858
You're not grown up yet!

600
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,819
If you were grown up,
you wouldn't talk back to me.

601
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,654
Children need a father,
that's what I mean!

602
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:38,100
There has to be a grown man at home.

603
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,933
You're not grown up.

604
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,776
Now you don't even greet me anymore?

605
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,653
Don't you recognize me?

606
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,458
How was school?
- It's none of your business.

607
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,260
If it weren't my business,
I wouldn't ask.

608
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,697
But we're friends.
- I don't need a friend.

609
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,819
Wait a second.

610
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,252
I know it's hard for you.

611
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,538
You're so young, and
you've had to go through so much.

612
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:58,135
I've also lost people I love.

613
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,417
It's not hard for me.

614
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,771
Tell me about the wolves.

615
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,455
Was it when you were fleeing
through the woods?

616
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,134
Who told you about that?

617
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,973
How do you know?

618
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,850
It helps to talk about it.

619
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,773
Leave me alone!

620
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,138
Okay, but I just want to help you.

621
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,769
The way you helped my father'?

622
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,017
That's not what I mean...

623
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,570
Why didn't you help him'?

624
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,539
Did you just try to save yourself?

625
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,379
Try it lower.

626
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,770
I'm using two.
- Ramasan's right.

627
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,216
I have one below,
and one at the top.

628
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,573
Jam it in there harder!

629
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,653
Turn it.
- The top one won't go in any further.

630
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:32,015
Try to force it. Push it hard!

631
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,978
Shit, someone's coming!

632
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,498
Where are we going?

633
01:15:58,580 --> 01:15:59,695
Stop!

634
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:03,018
Stop where you are!
You little brat!

635
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:18,130
Look, there's that bald guy.

636
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,779
Shit, man.

637
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,416
I'm leaving. Are you coming?

638
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,098
Come on, let's go!

639
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,897
<i>Let's gm</i>

640
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,933
That one, that was him.

641
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,898
The boy with the red hoodie?

642
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,609
It was you. You broke into my place.

643
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,817
Where?
- Hold on. What's your name?

644
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:45,573
Ramasan Magomadov.

645
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,936
Ramasan'? How old are you'?

646
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,410
Eleven years old.

647
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,416
Were you at the digger park
last night?

648
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,651
No, I was at home the whole time.

649
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,255
Home'? Why are you lying?

650
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,740
It was definitely you.
You're often there.

651
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:08,451
Pulling at the gate with your buddies.
Or are you saying I'm making it up?

652
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:13,379
And besides, the way you look,
I saw you last night, looking like that,

653
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,133
red hoodie and all.

654
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,252
Where are your parents?

655
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,218
They're not here.

656
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,014
What was your last name again?
- Magomadov.

657
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,092
Hello, what's going on here?

658
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:29,090
The gentleman says that last night
your son broke into his digger park.

659
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,458
So we're trying to clear this up now.

660
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,169
No, he was with me all yesterday.

661
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,736
Who says this?
- It was him, I'm sure of it.

662
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:41,371
I saw the jacket...
- How are you sure'?

663
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,692
Besides,
he and his buddies come by often,

664
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:46,977
climbing over my fence. That's why...

665
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,177
No, he was with me all yesterday.

666
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:54,250
Don't know what he talks about.
- It was dark, but the hoodie is the same.

667
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,457
And he's come by my place often...

668
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,689
Well...

669
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:03,616
I can't be 100% sure, but at least
his appearance and size are the same.

670
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,219
Hoodies are common.
- It's hard to tell by size.

671
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,013
It's a serious accusation.

672
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,933
You see lots of kids at your place.

673
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,211
Yes, there are a number of them.

674
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,091
But I recognize him.
Even though it was dark,

675
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,010
it was exactly the same hoodie
that he's wearing now.

676
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,736
Don't know about hoodie,
he was with me.

677
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,894
If you can't definitively identify him,
there's nothing we can do.

678
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,495
You look after your son
a bit better, okay?

679
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,450
He's lying.
He's not my father.

680
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,969
He's not your father?

681
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:39,929
No, he forces us kids
to break in and steal stuff.

682
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,569
And if we don't, he beats us.

683
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,612
Are you sure you know
what you're saying?

684
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,373
It's quite serious.
- Yes.

685
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,334
Who exactly are you?
- Well, I'm...

686
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,770
I'm his relative. Only one.

687
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:55,180
Do you have your ID on you?
- At home.

688
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,060
Where is home?
- Here, close.

689
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,650
<i>Okay-</i>

690
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,619
As far as I'm concerned it all looks good.

691
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:11,569
The apartment looks nice, the children
are doing well, everything's fine.

692
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:16,098
And it's great that you've made sure
to stay out of trouble.

693
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:19,856
See that it stays that way.
It's important. All right?

694
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,613
Okay. Then all the best.

695
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,012
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

696
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,659
Bye.

697
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,452
What's wrong?

698
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,137
You can play on our team.

699
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:34,059
Hey guys, they're on our team. Okay?

700
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,892
Shut up! Ramasan's with us.

701
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:40,337
What? We're two players short.
- So what?

702
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,698
I'm playing with Masud.
- He's with us.

703
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,734
We have two players less than you.

704
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,699
Fine, then take him.

705
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,897
But the goal counts! It counts.

706
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:13,979
Man, what's up with you?
- Get out of the way!

707
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,689
You watch where you're going!
- Shut up!

708
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,090
Get out of the way! Go on.

709
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,097
Yeah, just leave. Go home.
