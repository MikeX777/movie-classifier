1
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,380
Run... Save yourself!

2
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,960
Run!

3
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,180
Get out of my sight!
Go to hell! You filthy scum!

4
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,140
I had three shops.
Three!

5
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,310
I had my job, my life,
my dignity.

6
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,680
And now
I'm struggling to survive.

7
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,300
Everyone I trusted...

8
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,600
...screwed me over.

9
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,900
They're all useless.

10
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,610
Where's my government now? Where
are all those people I voted for?

11
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,770
Do you know
how many times...

12
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,980
...those scumbags destroyed
my shops over the past years?

13
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,140
Five!

14
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,390
No insurance company
will cover me.

15
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,310
Do you know how much I owe due
to the damages they've caused?

16
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,260
A year ago the bank
took everything I had.

17
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,970
I have nothing...
Nothing.

18
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,470
Everywhere I go,
everywhere I look...

19
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,010
...the streets are full
of those filthy people.

20
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,310
Enough is enough.

21
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,320
I refuse to wait until things go back
to what they used to be.

22
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,890
I refuse to accept
that my city has come to this.

23
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,140
And I refuse to do nothing about it.

24
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,520
I want them vanished
by any means.

25
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,180
I want them out
of our country.

26
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,600
I will support
any decision you make.

27
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,160
I believe racism is increasing as a result
of people being under pressure.

28
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,700
I believe racism is increasing as a result
of people being under pressure.

29
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,900
Hence, they don't think.
Or they're trained not to.

30
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,520
So thinking becomes a luxury?
- Yes.

31
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,230
When I'm in danger, for me,
thinking is a luxury.

32
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,570
And this applies to everyone in here,
but they don't want to admit.

33
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,150
Look at what happened
to Dafne!

34
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,370
Sorry.

35
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,400
The man who saved me that night
was an immigrant.

36
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
Not a Greek.

37
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,320
Your ticket, please.

38
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,520
It doesn't seem to be fake.

39
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,930
The guy who forged it has helped
many others to escape.

40
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,430
How can we be sure
that we won't get caught?

41
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,810
There's a guy on the train
and in Customs. He's in on it.

42
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,050
When will we have them?

43
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,100
It'll take some time.
Once they're ready, I'll let you know.

44
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,210
Do we have another option?
- No.

45
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,220
Then don't think about it.
This is how it should be done.

46
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,180
No.

47
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,790
This is God Eros!

48
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,340
But I'm so glad that I've met you...

49
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,470
What are you doing there?
- Nothing.

50
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,260
I was looking for some
old sleeping bags and I found them.

51
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,180
What do you want them for?

52
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,120
For Lydia.
We want to go camping.

53
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,220
Daphne?
- I'm running late.

54
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,470
Is there something going on?
- Like what?

55
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,130
You're never here,
you're always on edge.

56
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,250
So are you.

57
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,090
Have you met someone?
- Am I not allowed to?

58
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,540
I'd like to know.
- I'll tell you when I feel like it.

59
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,980
"Swimming".

60
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,100
"Food".

61
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,760
"Happy". "I want you".

62
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,230
"Hello".

63
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,110
"What is your name?""

64
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
"You are beautiful".

65
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,150
"Crisis".

66
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,430
"Time".

67
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,240
"I am in love".

68
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,400
"I am afraid".

69
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,970
"I miss you".

70
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,150
When did you learn all this?
- All of this for you.

71
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,390
Farris...

72
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,890
Yes.

73
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,230
I miss you too, all the time.

74
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,900
I am also in love.

75
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,690
I am also afraid.

76
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,490
I want to ask you
to come with me so badly...

77
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,440
But I can't do this
to you.

78
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,750
Everything is falling apart.

79
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,540
Did you know that they've been living
at the old airport?

80
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,650
They've been gun
and drug dealing.

81
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,990
We have complaints every day.

82
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,370
People are suffering!

83
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,170
Why are you looking at me
like that?

84
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,950
You are completely ignorant!
Like most of you people!

85
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,570
You don't realize that these parasites
don't let us live our lives anymore!

86
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,580
You really believe that the problem
is the immigration issue...

87
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,370
...or that the whole world
is changing at our expense...

88
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,530
...and we focus
on what they feed us?

89
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,860
Yes, one who becomes a fascist
is an idiot.

90
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,240
It leads nowhere and prevents
from noticing what's really happening.

91
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,580
On the one hand, they empty Syria's
chemicals in the Mediterranean.

92
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,670
At the risk of destroying
the whore ecosystem and tourism.

93
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,000
And on the other hand, they want
to enforce laws prohibiting people...

94
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,950
...from cultivating their land
and having access to water.

95
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,330
This has never happened before
in human history.

96
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,210
They'll control food, water...

97
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,130
...and soon enough common sense
will be obliterated.

98
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,800
Daphne?

99
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,290
Are you with us?

100
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,420
Do you want to add something?
- No.

101
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,620
Why is that?

102
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,700
Because, the way things
have turned out...

103
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,880
...I don't know if it's worse
for an immigrant or for a Greek...

104
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,630
...to be trapped in Greece.

105
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,250
"I love you".

106
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,250
"I miss you".

107
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,630
"I am in love".

108
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,050
"I want to be with you".
"Wherever you go".

109
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,260
"Wherever we can be together".

110
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,510
I love you.

111
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,850
I love you too.

112
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,280
Dad?
- Yes.

113
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,850
Is our home going through
an economic crisis?

114
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,980
Our country is going through
an economic crisis.

115
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,570
And when a country goes through
an economic crisis...

116
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,810
...parents stop sleeping together?

117
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,980
Of course not.
Why would you think that?

118
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,860
Then why do you sleep
every night on the couch?

119
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,360
Is this what happens
in every home?

120
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,560
No.
- Then why is this happening in ours?

121
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,360
Have you broken up with mom?

122
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,700
No. Play!

123
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,270
Then since you don't sleep
with her anymore...

124
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,490
...can I go and sleep
in your bed instead?

125
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,730
No, you have your own room.
Come on now, play.

126
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,520
How about only when it's raining
and there's thunder?

127
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,270
LOSEFT 50mg.
Treatment for depression...

128
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,870
...panic disorder, anxiety disorders
post-traumatic stress disorder.

129
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,580
Loan installment for the house
was settled. Sign here.

130
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,830
Remittance
for your parents' rent, here.

131
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,620
Life insurance
installment.

132
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,360
You sign here for your wife,
and here for your child.

133
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,440
Gas, electricity and property tax
has been deposited. Sign here.

134
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,740
You have yet to pay insurance for your
wife and father and your credit card.

135
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,660
How many times must I tell you?
- I don't want to study!

136
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,110
Damn it!
I won't say it again!

137
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,450
I don't care!
- Stop playing this goddamn game!

138
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,710
Dad!
- You never listen!

139
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,280
Dad!
- Just like your father!

140
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,650
Giorgos, can't you hear me?
Come out, for God's sake!

141
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,660
I need you, goddamn it!
I can't do everything on my own!

142
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,790
I can't handle
this child anymore! Come out!

143
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,870
Giorgos, I can't do it all
by myself!

144
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,970
Spyros? She asked me
to put out my cigarette.

145
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,210
Put it out, man.
We don't want any trouble.

146
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,050
Bitch.

147
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,430
That's why.

148
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,600
We're more hospitable.
We don't kick people out.

149
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,440
For fuck's sake.
Unbelievable.

150
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,860
She's throwing me out.
Fucking bitch...

151
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,330
Problems at home?
- No.

152
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,280
Everything's fine at home.
What's up?

153
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,660
Do you have a minute?
- Yes, of course.

154
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,700
I wanted to tell you something.
I want to ask you for a favor.

155
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,120
And I'm not asking you this
as a colleague, but as a friend.

156
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,290
What kind of favor?

157
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,870
Can you switch me
to your department?

158
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,900
Why?

159
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,160
Because I'm afraid
that I might get fired.

160
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,660
They fired eight of us
last week and...

161
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,410
OK, in my department
the damages are irreversible.

162
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,200
I don't have anyone to protect me.
There's a lot of backstabbing.

163
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,540
First of all, calm down.
- I can't.

164
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,250
I can't afford to get fired.

165
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,210
I don't know what to do.

166
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,160
No one will touch
your department.

167
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,240
You've been working here
for 15 years. They trust you.

168
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,000
If you ask for my transfer,
they might do it.

169
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,880
But if I ask
for your transfer...

170
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,050
...that means that I'll have
to let go one of my own people.

171
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,030
I can't do that, Odyssea.

172
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,540
Could you at least
say something?

173
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,410
To that chick?

174
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,920
You're a manager.
She'll listen to you.

175
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,380
She doesn't have a clue
what's going on here.

176
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,040
She just carries out orders.
- Odyssea...

177
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,290
...we're all on the same boat.
- Yes.

178
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,670
Even if I ask for something like that
they'll turn it down.

179
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,370
Despina is pregnant.

180
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,000
That's good.

181
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,490
That's something
that you wanted, right?

182
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,540
Tomorrow I'm taking her
for an abortion.

183
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,330
When you have so many
unnecessary accountants...

184
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,550
...you'll have to get rid
of half of them.

185
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:19,550
Look, I don't give a damn
that they confiscated my home.

186
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,460
I shouldn't have believed I could
afford to own a house anyway...

187
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,800
It's all my other debts...
If my wife leaves me too...

188
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,170
How are you doing?
Is the family OK?

189
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,920
We've lost touch. We should
get together some day.

190
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,300
If you could please help me...

191
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,110
Too bad.

192
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,480
Because I wanted to tell you
that I'm falling in love with you.

193
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,410
Say you're sorry,
say you're sorry.

194
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,400
No, you'll have your checks
next month. I promise.

195
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,120
You've nothing to be afraid of.

196
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,820
All this is for the company's
best interest.

197
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,400
Odyssea?

198
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,920
Odyssea!

199
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,930
It's a real mess, isn't it?

200
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,600
Departments
are being merged.

201
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,640
Ten more will be fired. Sure, I know
we're not yet affected by that.

202
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,130
But until when?

203
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:45,800
Excuse me, doesn't this
stress you out at all?

204
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:50,270
Ilias, I'm busy
and I'm not in the mood.

205
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,310
Yes, so I've heard.

206
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,560
I don't care what you've heard.
I told you, I've got work to do.

207
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,390
What have you heard?

208
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:07,440
Those love affairs...

209
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,430
You know,
they're the most tricky...

210
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,770
If, in fact, one can distinguish
passion from love.

211
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,900
No one wants them...
Everyone gossips.

212
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,190
Then comes all the guilt, that
we fell for the wrong person...

213
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,860
...and you try to find a way
to change everything...

214
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,150
So it's best to pretend
and look the other way.

215
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,730
You suffer, you miss her,
you meet in secret.

216
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,150
You listen to music, you want
to get away with your lover.

217
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:41,400
And you keep thinking
"It can't be. We feel the same way."

218
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,440
And, of course,
we keep ignoring things...

219
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,910
...believing that whatever happens,
we'll make it.

220
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,480
And then comes a day
when we hear...

221
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,150
...that our friend who got fired
killed himself.

222
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,860
And that the idiot was too weak
to handle it.

223
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,560
Expendable.

224
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,570
He's neither the first
nor the last one.

225
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,110
So what? Because
he asked for our help?

226
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,480
"Love, invincible in battle".

227
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,440
Odysseas' wife
just called.

228
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:36,120
They found him this morning.
He hung himself.

229
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,150
The funeral is tomorrow.

230
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,280
But she doesn't want
to see your face.

231
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,990
It's unfair, I know.

232
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,360
But that's the reality.

233
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,320
It's over.

234
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:10,910
"Danke!"

235
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,330
Anyway.

236
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,840
Vinaigrette, prosciutto...

237
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,760
...parmesan...

238
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,060
You eat well and we don't even
have money to buy feta cheese.

239
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,340
You know?
- Thank you.

240
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,460
You're welcome.

241
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,340
We don't even have money
for cherry tomatoes.

242
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,470
Thanks to you.

243
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,010
Okay, it's not your fault.
It's just me.

244
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,970
No, it's okay.
I have coffee at home.

245
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,430
I have to go.

246
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,140
Out of habit.
I don't buy anything.

247
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,760
I have to go.

248
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:18,760
Historian!

249
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:22,320
So you know better. Won't you
give us back what you owe us?

250
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,200
You started two wars.

251
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,780
You destroyed nations.
Have you forgotten all that?

252
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,900
It used to be.
Now, very different.

253
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,400
How do I say that?

254
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,070
That's why you say that.

255
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:52,480
I almost forgot.
This is a patch for your back.

256
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,480
That's what happens
when you ride bikes at your age.

257
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,490
I always loved to walk around.

258
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,580
Watch people, observe them.

259
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,490
Try to figure out
if they're happy, or sad.

260
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:53,330
If they feel lonely,
just like I do.

261
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:56,210
I didn't have the chance
to do what I wanted.

262
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,210
I wanted to study,
but I got married, had children.

263
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,500
Time slipped away.

264
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:05,160
Now I'm talking to you...
You don't understand a thing, do you?

265
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,950
But who knows?
Perhaps you can feel me.

266
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,840
Soap.

267
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,630
Soil.

268
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,460
Soil.

269
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,960
"Occupation Compensations".

270
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,380
You have such beautiful eyes...

271
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:35,250
Knowledge.

272
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,750
Faith.

273
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,680
Oh, lentils...
I almost forgot.

274
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:40,890
Dear God!
From politics to Greek tragedies.

275
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,020
God Eros.

276
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:22,570
Me too. If you only knew how
I long to see you every week.

277
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,650
Sixty.

278
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,990
I'm crazy.

279
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:23,410
We'll go to jail!
Let's go back, it was a mistake!

280
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:26,620
Jesus, what are we doing
at our age?

281
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,110
You're just as good at bribing
and then you judge us!

282
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,250
"Age".

283
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,510
"Excitement".

284
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,840
"Excitement".

285
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:37,960
Well done.

286
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,460
"Routine".

287
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,090
"Imagination".

288
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:50,180
"Guilt".

289
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,170
"Strength".

290
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,090
"Strength".

291
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,420
"Habit".

292
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,510
"Change".

293
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,250
"Denial".

294
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:21,050
No, this doesn't count.
No, I'll stop playing.

295
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,840
A lot.

296
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,140
And what if it's too late?

297
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:24,930
It's never too late.

298
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:50,560
What's this? In English?
I can't read English.

299
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,940
"Second chance"?

300
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,020
Together.

301
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:27,360
Together.

302
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,480
You believe that we'll be together
for so long?

303
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,270
I miss you. A lot.

304
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,530
Spring.

305
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:57,620
Spring.

306
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,480
These two
must be related somehow.

307
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:11,820
On Sunday
it's my grandson's birthday.

308
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:17,200
We'll all get together at home.
I'll cook roasted lamb.

309
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,080
We'll sit at the table,
as always.

310
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:22,740
And I'll be so happy
to have my family.

311
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,700
My children, my grandson,
my health.

312
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,280
That's just the way it is.

313
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,240
Then they'll leave,
I'll clear the table...

314
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,540
...I'll wash the dishes while
my husband watches TV.

315
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,860
And me, above the sink...
Wondering if I'm happy or not.

316
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:48,700
When I'm washing dishes
it's the only time I question it all.

317
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,580
Is this what I wanted
in my life?

318
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:59,120
I've made terrible mistakes,
Sebastian. I'm to blame.

319
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,570
I taught them this way.
It's all on me.

320
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,700
How can I change it all now?

321
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:30,380
I just need some time.

322
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:33,160
Just some time.

323
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,670
Your father must not find out!
- I don't care!

324
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,630
I don't give a damn if they all
find out! I'm not ashamed!

325
01:26:57,790 --> 01:26:59,670
Please, I beg of you!
- What can he do to me?

326
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:03,290
You're very young. You can't destroy
your whole life over an infatuation!

327
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,720
You're all a bunch of hypocrites.

328
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,920
All I want is to be with him.

329
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:11,340
Mom, I'm in love.

330
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,090
Have you ever been in love?

331
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,930
Happy birthday!

332
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,800
Dad, Anna and I have been
separated for six months now.

333
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,460
You think I don't know already?

334
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:31,130
You think I'm an idiot?
Just because I keep quiet?

335
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,590
I don't want to be with Anna.

336
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:35,050
The normal thing is to be
with your wife and child.

337
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,420
You're 40 years old.

338
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:39,210
How long, you suppose,
this fling will last?

339
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,390
Do what you want to do
with her...

340
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,550
...and once you're done,
fuckin' ditch her.

341
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,180
Have fun, if you need to...

342
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:51,880
...but keep your family as well.
Are you listening to me?

343
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,590
And don't you dare tell your mother
any of this.

344
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:59,600
She's already stressed enough
with our finances.

345
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,440
So, you'll come
on Sunday...

346
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:05,340
...and we'll have
a great family time, as always.

347
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,590
That's how I keep
my family together.

348
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,460
Sometimes, we parents ...

349
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:55,440
... we make mistakes
which can confuse you.

350
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:57,910
Why?

351
01:29:58,490 --> 01:30:00,420
Because we are afraid.

352
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:02,630
Are you afraid of what?

353
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:07,010
Truth.
-And what is the truth?

354
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,590
It's true...

355
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,690
... that both Mom and I love you very much.

356
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:29,820
But we will be happier if we are
... lived separately.

357
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,250
Will you have your own apartment?

358
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:52,940
Yes, you will have your own room
in that apartment.

359
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:56,690
When can I come?

360
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,470
Every week. We will make
schedule.

361
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:06,900
You will have two homes and two rooms.
I promise ...

362
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:10,650
that you will not miss anything and
you will not lose anyone.

363
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,480
Is that true?

364
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:31,870
Yes.
-I do not like.

365
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:34,340
That this sometimes happens with the truth.

366
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:36,830
We don't always like it.

367
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:39,110
But ... Antonis?

368
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:44,120
I love you so much.

369
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:46,480
And from now on I will always tell you
truth.

370
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:49,880
So that nothing
confuses you anymore.

371
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,080
That's not easy.

372
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,510
No it's not.

373
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:11,410
In the second house, when it rains,
and thunder, can I sleep with you?

374
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,290
When it rains and thunders, you can.

375
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:20,370
Alright.

376
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:28,630
What is this? For protection. You never
know which can happen. We all have.

377
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:31,720
I do not need. I have my methods.
-Antonis ...

378
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,890
It's pretty hard now.
- I said I didn't need it.

379
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:41,130
You're scared. You have no reason to fear.
Our team always covers its people.

380
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:45,300
We will never leave you
unprotected. You have my word.

381
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:01,550
Maria, why is the door locked?

382
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:08,640
What's the matter, why did you lock up?
-By accident.

383
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:11,340
What do you mean, by accident?
- By accident, Antonis.

384
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,290
Our daughter is still out.

385
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,090
And you'll see he won't tonight either
to come home.

386
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:22,510
She turned off her cell phone.

387
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,300
Where were you?
Out.

388
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:31,870
I hate when it disappears like that.
I know she met someone.

389
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:36,030
I tried to be kind to her,
to tell me something but nothing.

390
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,120
Did she say something to you?

391
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:43,530
Not.

392
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,380
I'll wash it myself.

393
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:56,760
Everything got out of hand.
Everything is destroyed.

394
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:59,770
Have you heard of Anestisov
mini market on the corner?

395
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,110
They broke in and stole everything,
you disgusting people.

396
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:05,470
They ran away from us by a hair.

397
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,840
They camp in every empty
the building they find.

398
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:12,270
And this damned state does not
nothing to drive them away.

399
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,610
Do you know they live on the old
the airport?

400
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:18,770
They have weapons, they sell drugs.
Did you know they are smugglers?

401
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:21,900
Do you know how many complaints a day
receive in the municipality.

402
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,060
People are suffering!

403
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:27,860
Why are you looking at me like that?

404
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,650
You know nothing!
Like most!

405
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,780
You don't realize that
because of these parasites ...

406
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,520
... we can no longer live normally!

407
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,570
If we do nothing about it
question, who will?

408
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:47,740
Which is why you think I'm working
all this?

409
01:35:49,090 --> 01:35:52,590
Because you failed at nothing else.

410
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:58,520
What did you say?

411
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,000
Maria, what did you say?

412
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:28,890
You don't think it's your fault
for this?

413
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,730
He. Do you hear me?

414
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:33,640
You are my failure!

415
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:36,580
You never understood me!

416
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:39,600
Where were you when I needed you?

417
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,970
Where were you when my world
turned upside down? Where?

418
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:45,850
Everything I do, I do for my own
land and your children!

419
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:50,950
What did you do?
Nothing. Nothing.

420
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,860
When you're already proud of it
what are you doing...

421
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:06,780
Why don't you tell the kids what to do
deals with their father when he goes out.

422
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,750
You think I don't understand you?

423
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,870
When you are so sure of your own
beliefs,

424
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:17,620
why don't you admit them
in front of everyone?

425
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:23,240
Do you want me to tell you why?
Because you're ashamed. You're ashamed.

426
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:27,720
Because deep down you know you are
an ordinary jerk.

427
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:34,180
Mediocrity, illiterate. That
trying to prove through violence.

428
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,720
Fascist, it's you.

429
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:42,410
Not because of the state.
Not even for the kids, nor for whom.

430
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:47,220
What do you want?
Back your old life?

431
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:49,280
You won't get it because you don't
deserve.

432
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:52,510
You don't even know how to love,
nor how to give.

433
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:55,690
You just know how to hurt.

434
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:02,710
Why should I feel sorry for you? Why are you a
victim, and not all those people you're destroying?

435
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,970
And you think you should
proud of it?

436
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:14,170
I don't want to see you again.

437
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,300
I'm glad I'm your failure.

438
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:21,360
I'm just sorry I didn't
realized earlier.

439
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,920
But I'll tell you one thing.

440
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:28,130
That you never used our children again
as an excuse for what you have become.

441
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:40,700
What do you think?

442
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:43,030
That you are better than those who
making fun of?

443
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:45,110
You became like them.

444
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,550
Same!

445
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,990
Yes.

446
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:10,210
When?

447
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:30,410
Yes.

448
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:34,580
Yes.

449
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:40,510
Yes.
