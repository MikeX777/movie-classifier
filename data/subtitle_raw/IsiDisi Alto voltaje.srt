1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,701
AC/DC said that
"Hell ain't a bad place to be".

2
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,829
And Iron Maiden, that you gotta
"Die with your boots on".

3
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:42,500
My band, "DeadRatt", knows better:
Dying sucks.

4
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,128
In the end, it doesn't matter the
joints you smoked

5
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,005
or the chicks you banged.

6
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,177
Only if you live up to your
principles you can die in peace.

7
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:59,434
"In the way of virtue, there is life,
and in its ways there is no death".

8
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,729
Which is what I have just said,
but duller.

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,483
Excuse me, daddy,
could you do me a favor?

10
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,195
Can you make these penguins
shut the hell up?

11
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:10,904
Excuse me?

12
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,157
There's a serious burial around,
you know?

13
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,784
Thanks.

14
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,329
This lady has one helluva voice!

15
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,415
If I had that voice, I'd sing my way
to rock stardom.

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,283
I know you picked this flick
to have a few laughs,

17
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,745
but yesterday Eugene,
Isi's dad, passed away,

18
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,039
and you don't wanna
know how...

19
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,459
So, try not to make any joke.

20
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,253
Be careful with the hole!

21
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,296
Poli!

22
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,840
Are you ok?

23
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,592
Poli, you've fallen...

24
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,303
The "fallen one" is uncle Poli.

25
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:22,058
We call him Poli cuz' he's a
policeman and his name is Policarpus.

26
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,853
I made up his nickname.

27
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,189
My brother!

28
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,819
As a farewell, dear Eugene,
your son Isi

29
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,573
is gonna take your guitar
and play a solo in your honor.

30
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,742
Isi! Kick some ass!

31
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,330
Isi! Isi!

32
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
Isi!

33
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,752
You son of a dog!

34
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,478
Isi!

35
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:26,164
Isi, you son of a bitch!
Isi! Isi!

36
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,749
Isi!

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,503
Isi, look this way!
Isi, one question!

38
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,048
Isi, please! Isi!

39
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,593
Why did you accept to be
the new AC/DC singer?

40
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:43,556
Compassion.
Angus has been begging for ages.

41
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,560
One question, Isi!

42
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,689
Thanks, dude.
It's hot as hell in here.

43
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,776
Was it hard to leave DeadRatt,
your old band?

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:04:00,365
Hard? To leave a bunch
of talentless loosers?

45
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,283
Yeah, right, real hard!

46
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,537
AC/DC! AC/DC!

47
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,207
DeadRatt... fuck you...

48
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,715
Poor Isi.
I'm gonna have to pull some strings.

49
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,990
Goddammit!

50
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,674
What time is it, dude?

51
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,469
It's time to get
the fuck outta here.

52
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,850
What the hell were you doing?

53
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,687
Doing?
I was doing two hot ladies.

54
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,607
You're late to your dad's funeral
due to an orgy?

55
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,483
Yeah.

56
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,319
Isi, your father would be
proud of you.

57
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,237
It'd be the first time.

58
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,782
Take this, dude.

59
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,326
- What about Puke?
- Locked 'n ' loaded.

60
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,788
Puke, don't load it so much,
it's not a joint.

61
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,625
If this was a joint,
I'd load it much much more.

62
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,412
Olé! Olé!

63
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,623
It's important.

64
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,545
The historic value of this mausoleum
is incalculabe.

65
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,424
It survived Napoleon's invasion,
even the civil war.

66
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,428
In my opinion, it's... immortal.

67
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,673
No!

68
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,014
<i>Speaks japanese</i>

69
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,866
Motherfuckers!

70
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,827
You know what time it is, right?

71
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,122
Yeah. Time to get
the fuck outta here.

72
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,878
Fuck me!

73
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:47,133
HIGH VOLTAGE

74
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,306
Rock is dead.

75
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,100
Rock was born dead.

76
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,894
From a dead "slash" corpse mother.

77
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,732
No!

78
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,442
- Sure it's not!
- Of course not!

79
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:11,908
Rock it's son of revolution.
But we killed it.

80
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,995
Men like me decided that
the world was better without it.

81
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,790
Do you know how we did it?

82
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,543
- No.
- Me neither.

83
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,128
I'm not surprised.

84
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,799
Carvajal, tell them how
to end a revolution.

85
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,261
Making a trademark out of it.

86
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,889
Which, in time, is out of fashion.

87
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,477
Angie knows. She was a rocker once.
Right, baby?

88
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,988
<i>"What you are about to</i>
see has really happened"

89
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,122
Holy shit!

90
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,499
This happened this morning
in Leganes' graveyard.

91
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,127
A bunch of rockers
were burying a deceased comrade

92
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:08,381
and fired a cannon in his honor,
AC/DC style.

93
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,925
That's pure rock'n 'roll...

94
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,679
Are you crazy?

95
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,808
Crazy? I'm talking about bringing
back the essence of rock.

96
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,311
Something wild, dangerous, mean.

97
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,521
Let's kick some ass.

98
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,984
What for? Your TV show is a big success.
Which, by the way, cost me a fortune.

99
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:32,322
Ok. You say rock is dead, right?
Let's resuscitate it!

100
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,574
Is it out of fashion?
Fashions come back.

101
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,661
And, as you say, the first to know
is the first to get rich.

102
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,958
And you think of this after seeing
some lowlifes destroy a church.

103
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,128
Sometimes destruction
can be very constructive.

104
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,506
If you take off your clothes now

105
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,508
I'll talk to the
marketing guys tomorrow.

106
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,470
Of course, Berdún.
Whatever marketing guys say.

107
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,389
They are the rock.

108
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,267
- You miss it, right?
- What?

109
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,770
Rock 'n ' roll, your band...

110
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,814
What was its name? The mumps?

111
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:10,026
Angie and the anginas.
And yes, I miss some things.

112
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,030
Like what?
Being broken? Being a joke?

113
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,575
Blowing dicks of guys like me
in order to realase a record?

114
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,829
You know?

115
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,958
I miss the most the moments when
I didn't give a fuck about all that.

116
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,382
"HELL'S BELL"

117
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,051
This is "Booze".

118
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,429
You wanna know
who he is here for?

119
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,140
Eugene!

120
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:54,487
Eugene! Eugene! Eugene!

121
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,867
Just in case you didn't notice,
this party is in Eugene's memory.

122
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,328
This is what he'd have wanted.
A wild farewell.

123
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:07,334
But nothing as wild as the cannon.
I still have the "goose vamps".

124
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:12,547
And Isi... I'm sure he must be
thanking Puke right now.

125
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,595
Are you stupid? Did you have to
use a real cannonball?

126
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,847
I dunno! No idea!

127
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,141
You know the sentence
they could put up our asses?

128
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,143
No idea! I dunno!

129
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,699
I know, Isi is a bit of a bastard.

130
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:44,371
But not always.
Sometimes he's a lot of a bastard.

131
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,627
What? The spirit of my dead
boyfriend is possessing you?

132
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,297
See, I'm a medium.
Like Whoopsie Goldman.

133
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,133
- The black chick from "Ghost".
- And my boyfriend talks to you?

134
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,134
Indeed.

135
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:03,973
He tells me he won't rest in peace
'till you do his last will.

136
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,892
And what is it?

137
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,603
He's communicating...

138
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,563
Are you kidding?

139
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,317
I'm very superstitious!
I'm a sucker for the paranormal!

140
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,330
What does he say?

141
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,124
"Blow me".

142
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,794
It's true!
That's what he always said!

143
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,297
Well, let's give him some peace...

144
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:42,887
That's what I love about
being a medium: Helping people.

145
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,016
Please, careful with the teeth...

146
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,100
Very well.

147
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,896
What can I say about me?
I don't have a girlfriend.

148
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,568
But thanks to my job,
I get laid sometimes.

149
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,742
I'm the plumber.
I'm here to unblock the pipes...

150
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,870
Yes, come inside...

151
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,705
Deep, deep inside...

152
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,429
God, what a body!

153
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,599
The bill's gonna grow, baby...

154
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,611
Now, Lucy, now!

155
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:44,449
The water is coming!
Now, now, now!

156
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,370
<i>What a stream!</i>

157
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,957
Cut! Very well!
Let's shoot another...

158
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,959
You've been huge, Disi.

159
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,921
Thanks.
You want some cheese?

160
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,631
No, honey.

161
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,759
I don't eat dairies.

162
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,263
"Wild scream?", "Final destruction?"
What the fuck is this?

163
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,140
Don't you remember?

164
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,768
That's your idea.
Improved by the marketing guys.

165
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,854
My idea? This is a rock contest...
without rock!

166
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,189
But it'll be colorful.

167
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,567
And people will find it
funny "slash" amusing.

168
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,571
Obviously we need a casting of rock
bands willing to be humilliated.

169
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,117
What?
I won't sign this piece of shit!

170
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,330
Well, your contract doesn't say so,
does it, Carvajal?

171
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,709
Her contract says whatever you say,
Mister Berdun.

172
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,212
If you don't agree,
let your lawyer talk to mine.

173
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,339
Carvajal, talk to yourself...

174
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,466
Everything has already been talked,
Mister Berdun.

175
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:48,471
I wanted a Temple of Rock...
You've given me a circus.

176
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,599
Congratulations... Mister Berdun.

177
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,025
I'd fuck her right now.

178
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,944
What did you say about
the casting, Manuela?

179
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,448
We need some losers
we can manipulate.

180
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,659
That's easy.
We'll give them money and pussy.

181
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,911
What rocker wouldn't fall for that?

182
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,831
Gee, Disi, you are a non stop
ejaculating machine!

183
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,336
You should forget about rock
and get a serious job... like porn!

184
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:24,007
Thanks, Celia. I know this is
a decent way of living.

185
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,093
But what can I say?
Rock is my thing.

186
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,887
What? You guys play like shit!

187
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,305
Fistfuck you!

188
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:36,102
I've got the feeling DeadRatt
is about to triumph...

189
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,190
The band must split the fuck up.

190
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,693
That's a fuckin' cool idea, dude.

191
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:49,908
Wait a minute... What band?
Ours? DeadRatt?

192
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,368
No, the Spice Girls.

193
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,661
Of course I'm talking
about our band!

194
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,622
Puke, you kick his head
or we do it together?

195
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,542
I could do it...
but he may be right.

196
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,754
But your only talent is
beating the shit outta drums!

197
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,839
What else could you do
with your life?

198
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,219
My uncle has offered me a job
at a summer camp.

199
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,601
Come and get it, you fuckers!

200
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,144
Cookie... say something!

201
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,563
I wanna be a mother.

202
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,695
You're a pretty little fuck.

203
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,241
What happened to you, guys?
Where is the heavy fury?

204
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,827
We don't even have our own songs!

205
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,370
I'm working on them...

206
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,206
You're working on one, but
you ain't got the guts to play it!

207
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,918
'Cause it ain't ready...
It needs something...

208
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,380
It needs something... since
six years ago, when you started it.

209
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,425
Don't you get it? Our time is gone!

210
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,051
If you old man heard that...

211
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:55,932
My old man always
wanted to be a rockstar!

212
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,686
And spent thirty years
playing with his band!

213
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,897
At the end, he died of a
heart attack while jerking off.

214
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:09,070
And he's only known in his hood.
For his cans of cockles!

215
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,739
"Eugene's cockles"

216
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,047
I always dreamt of playing
my song at Angie's Show...

217
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,841
I guess we'll have to
keep on dreaming...

218
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,760
It's better this way, dude!

219
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,596
Now we'll have time for
the important things in life:

220
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,975
Get drunk, get laid, get high...
We're free, man!

221
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,393
You're under arrest!

222
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,312
But why?

223
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,813
Why do you think?

224
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:51,279
Destruction of a monument,
public scandal...

225
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,239
and poor personal hygiene!

226
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:57,744
I condemn you to pay 100000 euros!

227
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,747
What are ya talking about?

228
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,917
To get that amount of money
I'd have to rob a bank...

229
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,086
And you don't that to happen,
do you?

230
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,504
I can give ya 1000 euros...

231
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,007
Are you bargaining over the sentence?

232
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,009
200000!

233
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,388
Last offer: 1500. Right now.

234
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,806
Shut up...

235
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,016
300000!

236
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:26,022
And if you don't pay it,
your properties will be seized!

237
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,941
Tell me, Santa...
what shit are you smoking?

238
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:35,073
- 300000 euros!
- It's not that much...

239
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,200
I won't gather that money
in my mutherfuckin' life!

240
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,037
- I'm gonna lose the Hell's Bell!
- Don't worry, we'll find a solution!

241
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,831
Guys, guys, I have an idea!

242
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,582
You wanted to be a mother, right?

243
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,251
More than anything...

244
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,335
That's it!

245
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,588
I knock her up, we get the baby...
and we sell it!

246
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,883
You asshole!

247
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,262
We gotta pay in 30 days!
There's no time!

248
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,728
What a fucking shitty week!

249
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,732
First, we break up the band.
And now we lose the Bell...

250
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,816
Dude...

251
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,320
What if we get the band together
and get the Bell back?

252
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,866
"We're looking for the Wildest Band!"

253
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:21,953
If you're rockers, and you're nuts...
You're perfect!

254
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,705
Are we looking for this?

255
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:31,838
No!

256
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,798
We're looking for this...

257
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,185
We can do that, can't we?

258
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,645
That's what we're good at!

259
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:52,025
Alright, we enrol the contest,
win and save the Bell!

260
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,569
We need 300000 euros.

261
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:59,032
You can bet your ass your dear
Angie's prize is a piece of shit.

262
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,160
It's a pity this ain't an
american movie.

263
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,789
If it was, the prize would be
exactly the money we need.

264
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:11,711
"And the prize is, can you believe it?

265
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,884
500000 euros, dudes!
Much better than an american movie!

266
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,436
We're gonna have to win
that godddam contest...

267
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,606
Now you're speaking!

268
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,946
Come on, let's raise some hell,
fuckers!

269
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,427
Dude, did we hit something?

270
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,971
Nah, maybe a scratch...

271
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,728
Fucking shit!

272
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,401
Schizo, Dementia... damage control!

273
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,361
Maniac, they fucked the Panzer!

274
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,362
What?

275
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,741
You know what that means, don't you?

276
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,034
Nope.

277
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,911
Wacko, tell 'em.

278
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,915
It means the repair
is on your insurance.

279
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,126
What if we don't have one?

280
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:37,130
- You drive with no insurance?
- And with no driver's licence...

281
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,175
And sometimes I speak on my cell
while driving...

282
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,302
You wanna die?

283
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,721
Hey, dudes!

284
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:50,727
I know you...
You blew that church up, didn't you?

285
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,688
Yeah, but that was nuthin'

286
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,066
You shoulda seen us at St. Paul's...

287
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm Angie...

288
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,611
I'm Isi... And this is...

289
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:34,104
You know, this is happening
only in you imagination...

290
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,399
Yes, but could it keep it on
a little longer?

291
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:38,817
Disi...

292
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,568
Disi!

293
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,030
Wou-would I like to sign you this?

294
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,534
Fuck, man, this is my first demo!

295
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,411
I've had it for ages!

296
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,038
The very day it was released,
I stole it.

297
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,582
Well done. You got a pen?

298
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,092
The church destroyers...

299
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,845
Inga, bring her before
she gets stained.

300
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,949
I only wanted to say that I'm a
great fan of yours, Mister Berdun...

301
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,659
What's the name or your band, son?

302
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:33,788
"The Psycho Squad". I'm Maniac.

303
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,542
Maniac, you wanna be stars?

304
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,418
Yes.

305
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,503
Would you change your name?

306
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:41,588
Yes.

307
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,631
- And your style?
- Yes, yes...

308
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,885
And would you mind if I
screwed your mothers?

309
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,387
No, no.

310
00:23:56,311 --> 00:24:01,441
- We got a doubt "slash" question.
- Why these and not the others?

311
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,778
Because I hate lowlifes who
don't respect private property.

312
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,745
See ya. Bye, Disi.

313
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,796
What did she write, dude?

314
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:26,549
"For Disi. I'll steal your record
the very day it's released".

315
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:44,526
"Let's meet at your's place to see,
let's meet at your's place to see...

316
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:49,197
let's meet at your's place to see...
the last episode of "Friends".

317
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:57,956
We'll make mayonaisse we can spread,
and we'll play together the sitar...

318
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,086
all those things necessary to see...
tha last episode of "Friends".

319
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:09,676
"Tell me, please, are you
the last on the queue?

320
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,596
I left my curtains washing

321
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:21,354
keep my turn while I go
to the Butchery".

322
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,776
Thank you, Househusbands.
Who's next?

323
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,361
The Lilli-Putos.

324
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:36,911
"Let's buy together
one kilogram of mercury.

325
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,165
We'll be amazed by its density...

326
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,209
We'll shove it up our asses".

327
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,128
Could it be weirder than this?

328
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,340
"The wildest band,
the wildest band...

329
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,634
there is no contest
like the Wildest Band.

330
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:55,388
If you got a band, but it's not wild

331
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:59,392
you better not come
to the Wildest Band."

332
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:08,193
"I'm on a highway to hell...
On a highway to hell..."

333
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:13,156
"Tonight we're gonna
drink ourselves to death...

334
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,783
Fuck, yeah!"

335
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,535
"We're the Sisters
of the Endless Torment..."

336
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,791
"Bushido is right. Samuright!"

337
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:33,843
"I ain't living la vida loca...
I'm living la vida tough...

338
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:39,140
Maybe I have no sweet feelings,
but at least I like to sing...

339
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:43,895
Everybody!
Metal lovin', bulletproof...

340
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:48,191
mental loving, balletproof ".

341
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:54,197
DeadRatt, band number 136.

342
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,919
Wait a second, weren't we
going to play "Highway to hell"?

343
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,546
We were going to play your song...

344
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,549
- Mine? It ain't ready yet...
- It was "Run to the hills"...

345
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,926
"Creatures of the night", that's it!

346
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,428
"Creature of the night", that's you!

347
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,638
Isi, don't be mean to Cookie...

348
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,724
Puke, did I tell you to defend me?

349
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,726
Cookie, how is "Creatures" like?

350
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,478
It's like finished, not like yours.

351
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,815
- Isi, don't be mean to Disi...
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

352
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,914
Stop fighting, dammit! You're in.

353
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,460
Fuckin' "A"!

354
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,802
You didn't want a circus but
you choose a bunch of clowns...

355
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,013
Don't call them "clowns"...

356
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:03,600
Angie, Angie...
We got something for you...

357
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,103
Yo, yo... He's my friend.

358
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,024
You' re right, they aren't clowns.
Theyre buffoons.

359
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,859
Inga, let 'em go!

360
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:15,737
It's a flyer.

361
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,282
What did you expect, a bazooka?
Inga, fucking let 'em go!

362
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:21,951
Fuck...

363
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:29,042
See, tonight we throw a party
and it'd be great if you came.

364
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:35,090
You can take your old man with you.
We got hot milk and everything...

365
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,258
Probably comes from your mothers.

366
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:41,221
- Oh, I'm not her father...
- You're her grandfather?

367
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,556
Cool, we have special offers
for the elders!

368
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,934
Sorry, we can't go.

369
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,813
We have a dinner with the band
that will win the contest.

370
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,526
- At ten?
- At ten.

371
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:50,206
I'm scared. And nervous...

372
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,754
Well, not nervous,
'cause she ain't gonna come.

373
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,630
But what if she comes?

374
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:01,468
What do I do? What do I say?
And Isi, Puke and Cookie

375
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:04,262
really wanna help me...
And that really scares me shitless.

376
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:07,223
Dude, why are you hiding?

377
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:12,395
The moment Angie gets in here, you
show her one of your porn movies:

378
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,939
"Indiannus Jones and the Temple
of Fuck". It's romantic enough.

379
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:18,985
And when she asks:
"Is that dick yours?".

380
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,279
You go: "Sure. Wanna see it?".

381
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:24,491
And you take it out! Nice and Disi!

382
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:26,201
Are you nervous?

383
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:29,871
Me? Nah, she ain't coming...

384
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:31,748
There she is...

385
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,050
You're Angie, right?

386
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:43,551
Well, sometimes.

387
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,887
You're hotter than in tv...

388
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,764
How original...

389
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:51,976
Angie, it's an honor to have you here...

390
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,978
Look, what the hell is that?

391
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,110
He got dizzy...
People drink like crazy...

392
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,530
Angie, would you sign me
an autograph?

393
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,241
- Let her breathe!
- This is Hell's Bell, our joint.

394
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,285
- It's fucking cool.
- Disi must be around.

395
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,955
Disi, look who's here!

396
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,709
- What's up?
- Angie! I knew you'd come...

397
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,962
I'm smoking a joint,
not nervous at all, ultracool!

398
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:24,092
This is one hell of a joint!
Whose is it?

399
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:24,843
- His.
- His.

400
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,219
Both of you?

401
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:31,391
I only have one percent.
He's the brains, the heart...

402
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,644
the ding fucking dong of the Bell!

403
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,940
Disi, thanks for helping me with
my Quantum Physics Test.

404
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,443
Motherfucker is brilliant!

405
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,572
He's a genius, all brains...
We leave you alone.

406
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,408
Cute t-shirt...

407
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,161
It's you.

408
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,412
I know.

409
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:58,335
You're a box of surprises.
I wonder what's coming next...

410
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:28,531
...and I've had a lot of jobs:
Undertaker, ice delivery man...

411
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:32,035
...zoo cleaner
and slaughterhouse cleaner!

412
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,287
And above all, you're a porn actor.

413
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,707
Above, below...
whatever the director says.

414
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,584
But that's temporary...

415
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:43,505
...till the rock comes for me.
Just like you, right?

416
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,384
Wrong. The rock already came for me.

417
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,762
What do you mean?

418
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:56,184
Berdun decided that
I had been made for TV.

419
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,853
Well, your TV show is alright...

420
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:02,315
But Angie and the Anginas
were fucking "A".

421
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:08,071
"Raising fever" was a
motherfucking "A" tune...

422
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,116
Don't you miss that?

423
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,247
I'll tell you a secret...

424
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:20,291
Look.

425
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,588
I haven't written a song for ages...

426
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,882
But I'll always carry
this recorder with me.

427
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,969
Just in case
a great song comes to me.

428
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,638
I'm writing one
that's gonna blew you away.

429
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,265
Right now?

430
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,183
No, for the last six years.

431
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,644
But it ain't ready yet.
Needs something.

432
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:43,440
Six years with a song?
Do you how much is that?

433
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,358
Isi says that's one helluva lot.

434
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:50,030
Right. The last time I played
was exactly one helluva lot ago.

435
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:53,324
One helluva lot? That much?

436
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:04,711
Dudes, listen to me!
Angie is here tonight!

437
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:13,053
You remember "Raising fever"?

438
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,269
Fuckin' Keanufucker...

439
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:25,190
Will my boyfriend's spirit
be around much longer?

440
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,276
Thank you.

441
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:49,209
Angie, Angie!

442
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,092
In which war did you meet together?

443
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,971
It was no war.

444
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,391
It was something worse.

445
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,227
Much, much worse...

446
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,230
We met...

447
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,317
at the casting
of American Idol.

448
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:20,782
Angie, you're just on time.
Desinfect yourself and have dinner.

449
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,161
No.

450
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,330
I'm real tired.

451
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,917
DeadRatt's party was
fucking amazing.

452
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:38,675
Berdun, it would be great if the
Psycho Squad won the contest.

453
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,760
But we're worried about DeadRatt.

454
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,764
They're the wildest
"slash" meanest "slash" beastiest.

455
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:47,017
And they're Angie's favorites.

456
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,436
Angie can go to hell!

457
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:59,112
Psycho Squad will win.
We'll play dirty if we have to.

458
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,906
Hell, we'll play dirty anyway.

459
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,370
Q and A: Are you ready to rock?

460
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,513
This moment rocks, right, Isi?

461
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:29,768
- I've seen you peeing many times.
- I mean the contest.

462
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,062
It's the hugest gig
we've ever been at.

463
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:35,482
Chill, the only things at stake
are the Bell, our band...

464
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,233
and the woman of your life.

465
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:39,569
Would you stop splashing?

466
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:44,115
They are all worthless pieces of shit...

467
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:52,415
You can bet your asses
we ain't seeing anything wild.

468
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:56,336
- You wanna something wild?
- You mean, wildly small?

469
00:38:56,836 --> 00:39:00,924
What wild thing could these bands
do we didn't do before?

470
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:06,179
Destroy a guitar on someone's head!
Nobody has done that!

471
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,473
Who could be
dumb enough to do that?

472
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:12,060
The way they speak, these guys
must be from Mostoles.

473
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:20,485
Our Wild Jury should be
sitting right here.

474
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,488
But the only way to keep'em sitting

475
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:26,741
is tying'em up
to a fucking electric chair.

476
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:32,497
I give you... Molotov!

477
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,967
Didn't you say
they are from Mostoles?

478
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,553
Like Angie's said... The Mostolov.

479
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,641
<i>And these are</i>
the wildest rock and roll bands!

480
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,562
<i>The Zombie Bullfighters...</i>

481
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:58,231
<i>Satan's Katanas...</i>

482
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:01,484
<i>Sisters of Endless Torment...</i>

483
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,778
<i>Youngblood...</i>

484
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,906
<i>Psycho Squad...</i>

485
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,117
<i>And DeadRatt!</i>

486
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:13,872
<i>First test: Wild Shout!</i>

487
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,692
Make me happy, Maniac.

488
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,319
Everything is under control,
mister Berdun.

489
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:46,863
Tonight we'll dine fried rat.

490
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:50,033
Shut up. If you wanna make me puke,
you don't need to speak.

491
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:52,660
Thanks for the compliment, sir.

492
00:40:54,412 --> 00:41:00,627
Straight from Hell's Bell...
DeadRatt!

493
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,694
Not bad, huh?

494
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,703
Fucking "A"!

495
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:40,500
You can scream clearer
but not louder! DeadRatt!

496
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:44,879
You know the difference between
you and a fucking piece of shit?

497
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:50,301
Me neither.
Don't disappoint me again.

498
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:56,099
Dude, how can you take
so much electricity?

499
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:57,726
It's a family thing.

500
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,645
My father was struck by a lighting
and survived.

501
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:03,440
- That very day he became rocker.
- What are the odds?

502
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:08,194
Odds, my ass! It was his destiny.
Natural Born Rocker.

503
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,241
Disi, your girlfriend's boyfriend
and Maniac are up to something...

504
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,996
In that case,
we'll play our best hit...

505
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:23,335
<i>Microphone handling test</i>

506
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:42,896
Our two finalists are Psycho Squad

507
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:50,236
and DeadRatt!

508
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:57,994
When this farce is over, I'll have a
band that will make me even richer.

509
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:02,916
You or them. My swiss account
doesn't give a fuck.

510
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:04,626
But I do.

511
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,087
I wanna crush that rat.

512
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,465
You tell that to Angie. She's
putting the audience against us.

513
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:12,300
She's your girlfriend, right?
Control her!

514
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:17,806
Fuck!

515
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:21,351
You got the footnote?

516
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:26,314
As I said, I wanna crush 'em.
Taking no risks.

517
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:29,192
Inga?

518
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,749
Dudes, I just came to wish you luck.

519
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:50,714
What's up?

520
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:57,095
Nuthin'...
They can't wait to play...

521
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:00,473
- God, you're beautiful...
- What?

522
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:08,898
Nuthin', nuthin'... Life is like it is...
Sometimes things can't be clearer...

523
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:11,067
Clearer?

524
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:15,655
Yeah... Like this joint.

525
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,616
These joint is a "seven papers".
You know why?

526
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,536
'Cause it's done with seven
papers. You see, it's clear.

527
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:24,914
So?

528
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:35,592
So... the World Recordman is a Dutch
who made one with eleven papers.

529
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:37,344
And nobody has ever beaten him.

530
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,305
Sure. That's why he's
a World Recordman.

531
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:44,642
- So, you got it, right?
- Sure I got it.

532
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:50,648
I'm gonna get a beer... 'Cause
I'm about to pee in my pants...

533
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,551
Kutcherfuckers...

534
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:21,888
They got toys... and we ain't.

535
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:31,773
Yes...
This the Final Destruction Test!

536
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:09,227
We're finished.
We can't do better than that.

537
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:14,691
<i>"What wild thing could these bands</i>
do we didn't do before?"

538
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,071
Are you sure?

539
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:24,951
The only things at stake are
the Bell, our band...

540
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,412
and the woman of my life.

541
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,833
Disi, Disi!

542
00:47:18,004 --> 00:47:20,340
- Do something, fast!
- Calm down, I'm the doctor.

543
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:34,229
Fuckin' "A", when we seemed
to be finished, we've equalized.

544
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:38,775
The Final Test
is gonna be the Wild Jump.

545
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:43,238
And we're gonna win because
jumping is Puke's speciality.

546
00:47:44,906 --> 00:47:48,410
What are you doing, are you nuts?

547
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,704
This see thru joints
taste like nuthin'

548
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:54,958
I'm leaving you, dudes.
I'm coming around.

549
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,545
Somebody has a real joint?

550
00:47:58,628 --> 00:47:59,796
Disi, dude...

551
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:03,758
Isi, get the fuck outta here!

552
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:50,263
"For Puke,
from a horny big-titted fan".

553
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:53,058
Oh, sweet Cookie of mine!

554
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:33,932
Puke has been neutralized
and Dementia is ready for action.

555
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:35,600
Can she jump?

556
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:36,601
Jump?

557
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,979
She's gonna fly... Like an ostrich.

558
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:41,439
Must feel lonely...

559
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:42,899
Who, Dementia?

560
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:44,192
No, your neuron.

561
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,780
Ostrich, ostrich!

562
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:56,329
Psycho Squaaaaad!

563
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:19,477
You won't break my ass,
you fucking demons!

564
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:22,355
Is he high or what?

565
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,818
Nobody is gonna rape Puke!

566
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:32,782
Come down, we won't hurt you!
Your ass is ours!

567
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,869
No, my ass is mine! Mine!

568
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:39,205
Come here, honey,
I'm gonna give you all of it!

569
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,417
Not a little bit, a whole lot of it!

570
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:44,627
Not me, not me!

571
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:49,341
Puke, look what you're missing!

572
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:52,344
No, muuuuuum!

573
00:50:55,138 --> 00:51:00,685
<i>Start the engine, my ass is mine!</i>

574
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,605
Dudes, the Psycho Squad did it.

575
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:06,483
- How do you know?
- Female intuition...

576
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:11,780
This Clooneyfuckers fucked us.

577
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:14,908
Puke is so high
he won't be able to jump.

578
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:18,828
There's only one person
in the world who can help us...

579
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:21,373
So I'm aware of.

580
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:31,925
Booze, it's Disi. It's an emergency.

581
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:37,347
Disi, I'm busy right now.

582
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:42,936
It's Puke, he's high...
Higher than ever...

583
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:44,729
I'll be there
the moment you say "fine".

584
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,064
Fine!

585
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:50,235
I'm here, Disi.

586
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:51,945
Yo, Booze, cool!

587
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:54,781
Two things you need
to know about Booze:

588
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:56,950
Before retirement he was a nurse...

589
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:58,993
And before that he was a hippy.

590
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:01,454
And experienced with every drug...

591
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,958
That's why I admire him.
Because he's cultivated!

592
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:14,676
Puke is high on LSD,
peyote and toxic mushroom.

593
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:17,887
It's a miracle he's survived.

594
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:25,311
But don't worry:
He'll be fine in six or seven...

595
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:26,104
months.

596
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,731
No fucking way.

597
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,358
We need a solution
in six or seven minutes!

598
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:32,569
Are you willing to risk lives?

599
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:33,486
Our lives?

600
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:34,738
No, Puke's life.

601
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,239
Oh, then no problem!

602
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:45,915
This is mutant adrenalin.
It will neutralize the drugs...

603
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:48,626
...but secondary effects worry me.

604
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,086
What secondary effects?

605
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,716
DeadRatt, showtime!

606
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:00,055
You killed him!
You broke his ass and killed him!

607
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:01,097
They are here.

608
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:03,516
Where the hell were you?

609
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,561
No, no, not my ass...

610
00:53:06,644 --> 00:53:09,481
Cookie, stab him!
Go Uma Thurman on him!

611
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:17,489
Jump, dude, jump!!

612
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:01,908
- Your joint, Isi...
- Cool.

613
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:05,787
- Your beer...
- Doublecool.

614
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,960
ONE MONTH LATER

615
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:13,712
Cookie!

616
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:16,756
<i>Well, this is no dream.</i>

617
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,677
<i>DeadRatt won the contest</i>
and we're stars at last.

618
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:26,182
<i>And we've been on TV...</i>
At the wildest TV show in the world!

619
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:30,979
So... you're supposed to be
the wildest rockers, aren't you?

620
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:34,733
Not when I see
a hot chick like you...

621
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:38,570
Then I'm more like a kitty...
Uncastrated...

622
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:43,533
- I start purring and...
- Behave, we're on air.

623
00:54:44,242 --> 00:54:47,078
- You aren't making a joint, are you?
- Sure.

624
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:51,249
- Come on, man...
- Be patient, wait for your turn!

625
00:54:51,374 --> 00:54:53,626
- She can't fucking wait, man!
- Fucking junkie!

626
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:54,753
But...

627
00:54:55,253 --> 00:54:56,629
Try this shit, pussy...

628
00:54:56,963 --> 00:55:00,383
"I'm running over oldladies
with my motorcycle...

629
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:04,054
I'm having the time of my life..."

630
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,557
<i>Between parties,</i>
we've recorded our first song

631
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,559
<i>with all artistic freedom.</i>

632
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:13,063
<i>And Berdun loves us!</i>

633
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:14,814
What's the title of this shit?

634
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,400
"Running over oldladies
with my motorcycle".

635
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,486
They say it's a tribute
to the elders.

636
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:21,446
I don't give a fuck,
this shit isn't sellable.

637
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:23,448
I need sellable shit.

638
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:27,452
They won't listen.
They're very united "slash" close.

639
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:30,538
Motherfuckin' "A",
we nailed it in one take!

640
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,668
- Well, we crucified it...
- Let's do another take...

641
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:39,798
Disi, don't break my balls.

642
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:42,342
Why working twice?

643
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:45,470
They aren't as close as they think...

644
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:50,433
Berdun!
What about an orgy to celebrate?

645
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:56,398
Isi is the leader. We'll keep him.

646
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:58,274
I wanna know his weaknesses...

647
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:02,112
Look what I've found in the toilet!

648
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:05,407
"Cookie: I wanna give birth!"

649
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:08,827
"Hell's Bell set the standard!

650
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:11,830
"Ruin your diet with Puke"

651
00:56:12,622 --> 00:56:14,791
He's gorgeous! Oh my God!

652
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:20,839
What's going on here?

653
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:45,113
Well, is this
grandmotherfuckin' "A" or what?

654
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:47,323
Sex, drugs and rock and roll!

655
00:56:47,782 --> 00:56:49,325
You called this rock and roll?

656
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:51,244
What's with you, Disi?

657
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:54,164
Since when elevator music
is rock and roll to you?

658
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:08,762
Isi, there is something
I want you to see...

659
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:14,476
Berdun,
make no mistakes with me, right?

660
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:17,854
Holy shit...

661
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:21,149
These are the clothes
worn by Bon Scott

662
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:24,402
when he died drowned
in his own puke...

663
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:27,489
Bon Scott's last puke!

664
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:30,742
And just the puke is worth
more than 100.000 euros...

665
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:42,629
Thanks, Berdun... Thanks, dude...

666
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,556
Isi, you're a winner.
You won the contest, saved the bell.

667
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:57,435
- We gotta think what to do next...
- A rock record so fucking wild

668
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:02,524
that the AC/DC will name
an Australian street after us...

669
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:05,068
"DeadRatt Street"!

670
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:08,321
- Sound cool or what?
- Yes, but with what songs?

671
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:12,367
If Disi needs six years per song,
we'll need...

672
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:15,412
- Sixty years for ten songs...
- You're right...

673
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:18,707
I dunno how to keep
your fame for so long...

674
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:22,669
I'm talking about a record
that makes you millionaire...

675
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,504
in a month.

676
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,934
Berdun will produce
DeadRatt's record, alright...

677
00:58:38,309 --> 00:58:40,186
But it will be his not yours.

678
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,565
- I don't think it'll be rock!
- No fucking way!

679
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:45,692
He knows he has to squeeze you now!

680
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:50,280
And if he has to lie, deceive or
break the band, he will.

681
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,907
No grandmotherfucking way!

682
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:54,617
It happened to me.

683
00:58:57,912 --> 00:59:01,041
- I dunno... I'm not sure...
- You know you're sure!

684
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:04,627
But what about my band?

685
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:07,339
You are your band!
If they don't like it

686
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:09,632
tell'em to go fuck themselves!

687
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:11,217
Dude, they are my dudes...

688
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:15,221
But they're keeping you down...
With them, you'll never be a star!

689
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:18,683
Let's do rock for everyone!
Easylistening!

690
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,895
What? Rock is supposed
to be hard to listen!

691
00:59:21,978 --> 00:59:28,026
Rock was made up to break the rules
of a repressive society. Wasn't it?

692
00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:32,113
Isi, you have two choices:
Being a star or selling cockles...

693
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:34,157
like your father.

694
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:40,955
You have within your grasp
what your dad could only dream...

695
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:46,336
Take it.
He'll be proud of you at last.

696
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:51,966
He deceived me!
He produced my record...

697
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,968
It sold a lot, but it was shit!

698
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:58,098
Why don't get your band together
and tell Berdun to fuck off?

699
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:00,934
- Because I'm afraid!
- Afraid of what?

700
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:08,274
Of being broken again
and losing everything I got

701
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:11,778
for an impossible dream!

702
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:17,826
- But you're Angie!
- No...

703
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,120
I was Angie once.

704
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:25,291
This sucks or what?

705
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:28,169
I'm gonna find Isi...

706
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:36,094
Isi, where the fuck are you?

707
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:42,350
Disi, dude...
You gotta be open-minded...

708
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:44,519
These are the new trends...

709
01:00:46,646 --> 01:00:49,983
You know, Disi...
This is DeadRatt's new look...

710
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:56,072
But we got a less agressive
name for you, full of hope:

711
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,575
"Ratt in a coma"!

712
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:01,786
Ain't it wild?

713
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:07,500
Why, my Lord, why?

714
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:10,462
- You betrayed us, dude!
- Yeah, right!

715
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:13,381
If you wanna be losers forever,
no problem!

716
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,258
- But don't fuck with my career!
- Your career?

717
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:17,719
Take a look at yourself!

718
01:01:17,844 --> 01:01:19,804
You look like
the Bearded Spice Girl!

719
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:23,350
No, no...
You look like fucking Princess Isi!

720
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:29,856
- What did you call me?
- You are a fucking traitor!

721
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,444
What is Disi doing?

722
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:38,239
What I'd do if I had the courage...

723
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,744
If you had the courage,
you wouldn't have anything else.

724
01:01:45,663 --> 01:01:48,458
- Go fuck yourself...
- Stay real, dudes!

725
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:50,919
And have a nice shitty life!

726
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,466
"ANOTHER MONTH LATER"

727
01:01:56,549 --> 01:02:01,471
I'm the carpenter...
I gotta a lot to nail here, right?

728
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,645
- Right, get your hammer ready...
- The biggest one...

729
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:14,192
The... The bill...
The bill is gonna...

730
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:16,820
Sorry, Celia, I forgot the line.

731
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,572
Cut! "The bill's gonna grow, baby!".

732
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:22,325
It's the same fucking sentence
for the whole trilogy.

733
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,786
The plumber said it,
the carpenter says it

734
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:26,287
and the milkman will.

735
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:30,792
By the way, what about your milk?
Why do you ejaculate so poorly?

736
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:36,047
- Don't be so tough...
- Can't you see he's in love?

737
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,925
You used to be the best, Disi...
But you lost your magic.

738
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:41,720
Go back to rock. That's your thing.

739
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:46,933
Back to rock... How could I?
I ain't got a band!

740
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,936
Puke is working at a summer camp.

741
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:54,649
And I envy him...
I miss children's inocence so much...

742
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:56,609
You gonna burn, fucker!

743
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:03,199
Speaking of children, Cookie is
serious about being a mother...

744
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,662
That's why she picks
other joints to party...

745
01:03:08,246 --> 01:03:10,165
BANK OF SPERM "THE WHITE HOPE"

746
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:22,260
No! Softcore, not hardcore!
Like your pals!

747
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:24,387
Isi, what the hell
are you thinking of?

748
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,182
Hordes of barbarians
fighting to death...

749
01:03:27,265 --> 01:03:30,477
No! Think...
think of a beach!

750
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,980
Normandy! D-Day!
A fucking bloodbath!

751
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:36,399
No! That's not it!

752
01:03:36,524 --> 01:03:38,985
Think of the Little House
on the Prairie...

753
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:43,907
It's burning! And the Ingalls
are in, screaming!

754
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:46,659
Nobody follows me,
I'm gonna kill myself.

755
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:52,665
That asshole can't get
the essence of my band.

756
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:58,880
But the musicians aren't better...
They are not at my level.

757
01:03:58,963 --> 01:04:02,884
- Nobody is at your level, Isi.
- That's right.

758
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:06,179
But what about the songs?

759
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:09,265
They have been made
by my best composers...

760
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:12,519
But what about the title
of the first single:

761
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:15,355
"You and I are two"?
That's not rock to me!

762
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:18,525
If the title was "You and I
are two motherfuckers"...

763
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:22,821
Isi, you're about to become
a God of Rock.

764
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:24,989
And you're nervous, but that's cool.

765
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,534
Ozzy Osbourne felt the same way
when he left Black Sabbath.

766
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:30,203
Ozzy? What a sell out...

767
01:04:31,037 --> 01:04:32,872
Berdun, the car is ready...

768
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,543
Isi, it's your band.
You're the boss.

769
01:04:37,502 --> 01:04:40,171
But you're under
a lot of pressure...

770
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,299
Relax, man!

771
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:49,264
You're right, relax is important...

772
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:51,933
I'm gonna "relax"
their brains out...

773
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,984
Manuela, deduct hookers'
wages from Isi's.

774
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:04,070
Good idea. We are spending
too much on this asshole.

775
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:09,659
Maybe this asshole
can help us finance all this...

776
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:13,413
- See you, Julio!
- Bye, Disi!

777
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:18,293
Call me stupid if you want,
but I'm sure Isi is about to return.

778
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:23,923
And we will be friends again,
DeadRatt will triumph and...

779
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,175
Dude, I'm talking to you!

780
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,973
Dammit, this show is today!

781
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:34,851
Fucking money...

782
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:37,937
Well, I'll always have the Bell...

783
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:51,701
I'll call you back.

784
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,246
Hi! Nice day, huh?

785
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,249
Closing the Bell?

786
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:00,960
No, what makes you say that?

787
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,796
I dunno...

788
01:06:04,005 --> 01:06:07,759
Ah, you're not closing it...
You're pulling it down.

789
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:10,136
The world needs
a lot of parking spaces.

790
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,515
Yeah, but you know
this is Isi's, right?

791
01:06:13,598 --> 01:06:17,352
Yes, but Isi's properties
are under Mister Berdun's control.

792
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:21,439
And does Isi know
you're gonna pull the Bell down?

793
01:06:21,856 --> 01:06:23,775
As I told you,
Mister Berdun controls...

794
01:06:23,858 --> 01:06:25,443
Isi doesn't know it, huh?

795
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:31,199
Look, if you got a problem with this
talk to Isi's lawyer...

796
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:34,452
Wait a minute, that's me!

797
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:39,708
Well, there's nothing to talk about.

798
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,293
I need the contractor's signature.

799
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:44,337
And if he doesn't sign?

800
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,589
Then we can't pull this down...

801
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,008
If you don't mind...

802
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:52,887
You got something to scream about?

803
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:54,431
My wrist!

804
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:58,685
You mind, dude?

805
01:06:58,768 --> 01:07:00,729
Fuck this shit!

806
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:03,648
Isi must know this.

807
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:06,484
How am I getting
into Berdun's bunker?

808
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:09,446
Don't worry,
I got a brilliant plan...

809
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:15,994
- Yes?
- You ordered a pizza?

810
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:17,746
Disi?

811
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:19,497
How do you know?

812
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:21,875
I'm Angie. I got you on camera.

813
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,960
Get in, quietly!

814
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:40,185
"You and I, uh, uh, uh..."

815
01:07:40,268 --> 01:07:46,316
"I and you, uh, uh, uh..."

816
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:52,364
"Both of us, uh, uh, uh..."

817
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:57,410
"Are the two of us".

818
01:08:01,831 --> 01:08:03,541
Sounds good.

819
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,637
- Berdun will kill you!
- Who's gonna tell him?

820
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,264
What are you doing here?

821
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:25,063
I was telling Angie...
I wanna be part of Ratt in a Coma.

822
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,981
I don't believe you.

823
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:30,777
OK... I'm in love with Angie.

824
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,992
Bodyguards "slash" wardens
"slash" bouncers!

825
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:40,078
So you know,
I loved "Brokeback Mountain".

826
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,042
- Where's Isi?
- What did you say?

827
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:49,254
- I loved "Brokeback Mountain".
- You said you're in love with me.

828
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:52,549
I had to say something...

829
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:56,428
Manuela, make me happy.

830
01:08:57,887 --> 01:09:01,558
Tonight we're recording
Isi's concert...

831
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:05,145
30000 official copies
will be made in a week...

832
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:06,980
And in stores in ten days.

833
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,399
The official ones...
What about the others?

834
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:14,362
The others will be
in the black market... tomorrow.

835
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:17,741
Great. And they say
the record industry is in crisis...

836
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,869
Mister Berdun, we got a problem.

837
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,454
A big fat one.

838
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:30,378
- Disi, what are you doing here?
- And you? With all these shitheads?

839
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:37,093
- This shitheads are my new band.
- Fuck you, bitch!

840
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:40,180
Shut the fuck up!
Is it important?

841
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:41,681
Well, maybe...

842
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:43,892
There's a demolition crane
in front of the Bell.

843
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:45,977
- Why?
- Because it looks pretty...

844
01:09:46,227 --> 01:09:48,980
Cuz they're pulling the Bell down!

845
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:49,898
- No!
- Yes!

846
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:53,401
- Who?
- Some motherfucking scumbag that...

847
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:59,407
Hey, I was talking about you
a second ago...

848
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:02,202
Inga, get him out.

849
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:12,587
Let me go!

850
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:16,257
Don't forget you're a rocker!
Like your dad!

851
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:17,801
Natural Born Rocker!

852
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,761
That happened by chance!

853
01:10:19,844 --> 01:10:22,222
He become a rocker
due to a lightning!

854
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:26,393
If he finds out, he'll crawl up from
hell and kick the shit out of you!

855
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:27,936
And you know he will!

856
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:32,482
Isi, you're a rocker,
you'll always be!

857
01:10:32,565 --> 01:10:34,401
It's your destiny!

858
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:44,119
Isi, are you OK?

859
01:10:53,294 --> 01:10:56,131
Yeah, I am now.

860
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:57,924
Wild!

861
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,301
Let Disi go!

862
01:11:06,516 --> 01:11:09,811
Isi, open you eyes...
Open your eyes, goddammit!

863
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:11,646
I'm a rocker!

864
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:15,692
Are we in hell?

865
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:18,695
You wish.

866
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:27,454
Angie, I'm very worried about us.

867
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,957
I'm not sure I can trust you.

868
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:35,378
It must be because
you let Disi in my home.

869
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:39,841
Or becuase you laughed
when Isi kicked my ass.

870
01:11:39,924 --> 01:11:42,135
But I believe in us.

871
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,888
That's why I want you
to prove your love to me.

872
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:50,018
Either you do what I tell you...
or I kill Isi and Disi.

873
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,940
Isi has to play at the concert.

874
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:57,275
No, he won't.

875
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,861
Ratt in a Coma
are gonna play without him.

876
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:04,324
And you'll introduce them...
or I swear on Christ I'll kill them.

877
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:09,871
It'll be a great business:
Dead musicians sell more.

878
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:14,709
I can't believe
you're such a bastard.

879
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:20,632
No? I'm Alvaro Berdun.
I'm a billionaire.

880
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:25,261
You know how I became one?
Being a bastard.

881
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,765
I steal from musicians...
Cheat on the audience...

882
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:33,228
Blackmail politicians...
Ah, I'm who controls black market.

883
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:36,731
Hell, I even like "American Idol"!

884
01:12:39,192 --> 01:12:42,070
Do you think
I can't kill in cold blood?

885
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:47,992
My sweet Angie,
why do insist on thinking?

886
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:52,872
Why can't you be like Inga?
A fucking retard.

887
01:12:52,956 --> 01:13:00,255
You're mine. Either you get it or
I'm getting it into you.

888
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:04,759
Fine, I'll do it...
But don't hurt them, right?

889
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:08,054
Clever girl.

890
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:13,768
Inga, take her to the concert.

891
01:13:18,773 --> 01:13:22,402
Angie... Don't forget I love you.

892
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:30,994
I've just told Angie that I'll kill
you if she doesn't obey me...

893
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:33,371
But relax, I've lied to her.

894
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:36,916
It's Carvajal who'll kill you.
After all, he's my lawyer.

895
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:39,627
First, he'll shoot you
a tranquilizer dart

896
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:42,088
and after he'll inject
an overdose of heroin.

897
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,548
Great news, huh?

898
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:46,843
You're about to die
like true rock stars!

899
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:49,763
Time for questions.

900
01:13:49,846 --> 01:13:53,099
Would you please suck my dick?

901
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:56,019
I've just split up with my
girlfriend and I have a new proposal.

902
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:57,979
Disi?

903
01:13:58,063 --> 01:14:00,190
Before I die,
I'd like to smoke a joint...

904
01:14:00,273 --> 01:14:03,026
If it's not a problem to you,
grandmotherfucker.

905
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:09,240
One last thing, Disi...

906
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:12,911
Your death is going to be
a shock for Angie.

907
01:14:12,994 --> 01:14:16,331
And she is gonna kill herself
after the concert.

908
01:14:16,706 --> 01:14:21,294
It's a pity. You don't know
how well she fucks.

909
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:25,840
As they say in times like this,
see you in hell.

910
01:14:25,965 --> 01:14:29,719
They won't let you in, douchebag.

911
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:35,892
Dude, I don't think
you'll pass through.

912
01:14:37,852 --> 01:14:40,230
That green button opens
the damned gates...

913
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:42,565
If this was an american movie

914
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:45,652
I'd have a special gift
that the bad guys ignore

915
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:47,779
that would get us out of here.

916
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:50,240
Disi, what if we go on
with your plan?

917
01:14:51,616 --> 01:14:54,536
- What plan?
- Smoking a joint before we die.

918
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:01,459
What is this shit doing here?

919
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:04,713
It was parked outside.
Anybody could see it.

920
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:06,214
Good idea.

921
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,966
After you kill them,
put them in their van

922
01:15:08,049 --> 01:15:10,343
and leave them in any wasteground.

923
01:15:17,934 --> 01:15:21,229
This is impossible! The world record
is eleven papers!

924
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:24,315
- And nobody's beaten it!
- Come on, you're a champ!

925
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,693
You learned to say "joint"
before "mum" or "dad"!

926
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:30,321
To get the green button,
you need fifteen papers! Fifteen!

927
01:15:31,197 --> 01:15:33,366
That's against the laws of physics!

928
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:39,205
Disi, you've spent your whole life
getting ready for this moment.

929
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:46,338
Gimme another paper!

930
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,394
Come on, Isi, it's falling apart!

931
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:04,356
Aim right. Man!
It will only hold one hit!

932
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:05,357
Now!

933
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:12,447
Yo, you wanna smoke, dude?

934
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:16,368
Do we save your girl or what?

935
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:21,164
- Dressed like fucking Bon Jovi?
- No, like fucking Bon Scott.

936
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:33,134
Dude, how can we open this shit up?

937
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,931
Go to see what happens...

938
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,113
Dude, make up your mind!

939
01:16:58,993 --> 01:17:02,497
- Dude, the gates are closed!
- Get in the van, dude!

940
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:06,376
- What's the plan?
- Taking a run-up.

941
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:08,878
A run-up for what?

942
01:17:10,505 --> 01:17:13,967
- Fasten your seatbelt...
- There's no seatbelt!

943
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,608
Good plan, dude! I hope you got
another to get in the concert.

944
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,902
There's gonna be
plenty of bouncers in there!

945
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:37,365
Don't worry. It's time
to wake up the beast.

946
01:17:40,618 --> 01:17:43,246
There are two things you need
to know about uncle Poli...

947
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:45,623
One, he's a real deep sleeper

948
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:48,835
and two, his entry-phone
is fucked since 1975.

949
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:54,132
Disi, I think throwing stones
won't wake him up.

950
01:17:57,385 --> 01:18:00,889
Son of a bitch!
You won't take me alive!

951
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:05,602
Yes?

952
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:09,064
Cookie, do you know
where Puke could be?

953
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:12,150
Yes, he must be around.

954
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:20,075
Fuckin "A"! 'Cause we got
one helluva gig...

955
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:29,292
You want me to announce
that Isi and Disi are dead?

956
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:32,712
You son of a bitch!
You're gonna kill 'em anyway!

957
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,883
I'm not gonna kill them.
They must be already dead.

958
01:18:38,968 --> 01:18:43,765
If you miss them that much,
I'll make sure you join them ASAP.

959
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:53,858
Don't let her out.
Carvajal will take care of her.

960
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:03,243
Inga, there's something
you need to listen.

961
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:06,621
What happens next it's up to you.

962
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:16,131
"Why can't you be like Inga?
A fucking retard."

963
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:21,052
Uncle Poli, as a police officer, you
can confiscate any vehicle, right?

964
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:23,263
Well... What kind of vehicle?

965
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:25,765
DeadRatt!

966
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:49,956
My friends, I'm Alvaro Berdun.
I created Ratt in a Coma...

967
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,667
And I got very sad news for you...

968
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:56,004
Isi and Disi are dead.

969
01:19:57,797 --> 01:20:00,258
Damned drugs took them away!

970
01:20:02,093 --> 01:20:04,763
Let's keep a minute of silence
in their memory.

971
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:12,729
Banzai!

972
01:20:48,348 --> 01:20:50,809
Sorry, we couldn't find any tickets!

973
01:20:53,561 --> 01:20:58,316
DeadRatt! DeadRatt! DeadRatt!

974
01:21:00,026 --> 01:21:03,446
Security! Stop those terrorists!

975
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:30,306
You're gonna suck my!

976
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:39,899
Bitch!

977
01:21:40,942 --> 01:21:43,319
Freeze, motherfucker!

978
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:48,074
What are you doing? Arrest them?
Do you know who I am?

979
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:52,454
"I'm Alvaro Berdun.
I'm a billionaire."

980
01:21:52,537 --> 01:21:55,081
"You know how I became one?
Being a bastard."

981
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:58,126
"I stole from musicians...
Cheat on the audience..."

982
01:21:58,209 --> 01:22:02,422
"Blackmail politicians...
Ah, I'm who controls black market."

983
01:22:02,505 --> 01:22:06,718
"Hell, I even like"American Idol"!"

984
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:11,389
That's what happens
when you are honest...

985
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:23,443
Puke, I'm very worried...

986
01:22:24,402 --> 01:22:26,654
How will we name
the baby if it's a boy?

987
01:22:26,988 --> 01:22:29,449
I dunno... Anti-Christ?

988
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:32,202
And if it's a girl?

989
01:22:32,285 --> 01:22:33,828
Anti-Christine?

990
01:22:35,038 --> 01:22:38,291
Chill, you're gonna be
a motherfuckin' "A" mother!

991
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:50,804
You're the meanest and bitchest
chick I've ever found in my life!

992
01:22:50,887 --> 01:22:52,555
Will you marry me?

993
01:23:00,313 --> 01:23:01,690
"Do you fuck well?"

994
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,742
Disi, let's play your song!
Now or never!

995
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:16,204
No, no, it ain't ready yet!
It needs something...

996
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:18,832
And it's one hell of a something...

997
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:27,882
One, two, three, four...

998
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:47,485
Tight trousers, black T-shirt,
leather jacket, long haired...

999
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:52,907
No bartender in town
will let us drink no more...

1000
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:58,747
Stealing beers at the gas station,
try not to blow away the place

1001
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:03,376
with your joint. We drive the van
like hell, smell like hell...

1002
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,212
After all, we're going straight to hell.

1003
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:11,509
Who gives a fuck?
If we destroy churches...

1004
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:15,597
Who gives a fuck?
If we're the wildest band...

1005
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:20,101
Who gives a fuck?
If we run over old ladies...

1006
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:24,439
You wanna know how tough we are?

1007
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:28,318
We are fucking motherfucking tough.

1008
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:31,613
No motherfucker can mess with us...

1009
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:34,824
We are fucking motherfucking tough.

1010
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:38,370
But we got a fucking heart of gold.

1011
01:24:41,164 --> 01:24:46,961
What is it? Don't you like to party?
Dance! Scream!

1012
01:24:48,588 --> 01:24:51,883
But we got a fucking heart of gold.

1013
01:24:52,258 --> 01:24:55,178
Don't you go all Spice Girl on me...

1014
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:59,516
Hit me with a lightning and AC/DC me!

1015
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:09,734
Who gives a fuck?
This is no american movie!

1016
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:10,985
Who gives a fuck?

1017
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:14,364
But we wanna sell
the rights for a remake!

1018
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:15,365
Who gives a fuck?

1019
01:25:15,448 --> 01:25:20,453
The guy next to me
will be played by Brad Pitt!

1020
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:22,539
And this chick will be
Angelina Jolie!

1021
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:26,459
We are fucking motherfucking tough.

1022
