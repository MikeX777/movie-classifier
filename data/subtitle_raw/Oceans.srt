[CHILDREN CHATTERING
AND LAUGHING]

2
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,589
A boy comes running up, and he asks:

3
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,761
"what exactly is the ocean?

4
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,133
what is the sea?"

5
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:53,576
You could hit him with a lot of statistics
and Latin names.

6
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,617
But the answer isn't something
you'll find in a book.

7
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:05,288
To really know what the ocean is,
you have to see it for yourself.

8
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,029
You have to hear it

9
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,595
and taste it.

10
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,769
You have to feel its power.

11
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,084
To really know the ocean,

12
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,887
you have to live it.

13
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,632
The ocean is vast,

14
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,372
and most of us
only ever experience a small part of it.

15
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,539
One point of view,
like that of a marine iguana

16
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:08,382
gliding through the water
off the coast of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands.

17
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:59,566
Born of a miraculous mixture
of matter and energy,

18
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,103
the ocean is an ancient place.

19
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,581
But it is more than just a place.

20
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:22,219
In a very real sense, the ocean is alive.

21
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:28,694
In fact, it was already brimming with life
for billions of years

22
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:34,136
before ancestors of the horseshoe crab
first crept up on the beach.

23
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:12,508
All manner of creatures followed,

24
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,979
gazing toward the heavens
with prehistoric eyes.

25
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,587
Then, in the span of one lifetime,

26
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,491
as the human race
reached for the stars,

27
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,360
it seems like all of nature
got out of whack.

[ROCKET ENGINES BLASTING]

29
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,971
As hard as we try,
as long and as far as we look,

30
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:21,478
no one's ever spotted an ocean
like ours out in space.

31
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,842
But we have discovered new galaxies

32
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:31,048
right here where we least expected,
within our ocean.

33
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:52,005
Get deep enough and close enough
inside a drop of water,

34
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:57,081
the larva of a sea urchin
is like an asteroid,

35
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,215
and a crustacean egg

36
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:11,989
resembles some exotic
and uncharted planet.

37
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:29,740
In the beating of a newborn heart,
a world begins.

38
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:03,213
If you take a step back,
it's easy to see how life itself began:

39
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,442
in a pulse of water

40
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:09,350
and a splash of sunlight and color.

41
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:27,996
A little at a time,

42
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,042
new forms of life came rippling through
the waters of the world,

43
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,011
spreading and multiplying,

44
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,845
adapting and evolving.

45
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,129
As far as the eye can see,

46
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:05,175
north and south and east and west,

47
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,940
the ocean smiles at the sky.

48
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,379
Barely scratch the surface

49
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:15,715
and you will find charging herds
in a breathless chase

50
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,983
near the coast of South Africa.

51
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,613
when it's all over,

52
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:12,322
the dolphins, the birds, the sharks
and the whales have had their fill,

53
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:19,395
but plenty of sardines survive,
so life can go on.

54
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,864
when explorers crossed oceans
in search of a new world,

55
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,902
they hardly knew what wondrous events
were taking place

56
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,514
so close below them.

57
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,614
Below their hulls,
Mobula rays went soaring

58
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,686
through the very currents
that bore their ships along.

59
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:18,314
As the wind rippled
through their sails overhead,

60
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:22,291
how could they imagine
the unseen silk scarves

61
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:25,328
rippling through the water below?

62
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,713
The exquisite blanket octopus.

63
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:28,016
How could they imagine the beauty
and grace of the ocean's bounty?

64
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,816
A few short centuries ago,

65
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:59,390
huge territories were the domain
of marine animals.

66
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,358

And ever since,

00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,941

[WHALES CALLING]

76
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,424
Massive and majestic,
they glide along the ocean floor

77
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,189
without disturbing
a single grain of sand.

78
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,805
One generation follows the next.

79
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:23,649
And each mother gently nudges her baby
to the surface,

80
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:27,246
helping him along
on his way to breathe.

81
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,175
Merely knowing these creatures exist

82
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,079
isn't enough to tell the stories
of their lives.

83
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,625
For that, you've got to get a little closer

84
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,457
and stay a little longer.

85
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,707
You've got to see them jump
and turn and swim,

86
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,937
hear them breathe and move.

87
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:33,324
A sea lion's life is as much about playing
as it is about hunting.

88
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,391
A cormorant may be looking for lunch,

89
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:50,832
but chasing a porcupine puffer fish
is all about fun.

Time creeps slowly by
on a lazy afternoon,

On the beaches of South America,

96
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,856
a select group of orcas
have developed a method

97
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,027
for hunting young sea lion.

gobbles healthy helpings
of a tiny shrimp-like creature called krill.

00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,791
On a clear night,

102
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,597
as the ocean draws her secrets close,

103
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,508
the moonlight dances on the waves

104
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,979
and filters down to the coral reef.

105
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,718
Already the crab is on the prowI.

106
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:33,936
Some peep out from behind their shells
to check if the coast is clear.

107
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:44,488
Others have found a hiding place
to settle in for the night.

108
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:54,395
Sound actually carries farther
and faster underwater.

109
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:03,502
Every crackle and click
is registered and understood.

110
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:21,516
The first flap of a baby shark's fins.

The brush of sand as a moray eeI

Some go scuttling about.

00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,534
Others seek cover.

114
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,538
A hermit crab
who has put on a little weight

115
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,342
needs more spacious accommodations.

116
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,250
Some dine.

117
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,258
Some try to blend into the landscape.

118
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,377
Some stake out their territory.

119
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:18,808
Busy taking out the trash,
the mantis shrimp keeps a sharp lookout.

120
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,742
He doesn't take kindly to trespassers.

121
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:32,686
So if he finds one,

122
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,253
look out.

123
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:41,318
Meanwhile, a sea slug
called the Spanish dancer

cuts a swath through Australian waters
like a whirI of a flamenco skirt.

125
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:41,540
For many creatures on this planet,
life began in the sea.

126
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,839
Some have returned to the sea.

127
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,120
The dugong's ancestors lived on land.

128
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,720
Now he grazes in underwater pastures.

129
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,391
And the plants and flowers
and grass he eats

130
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,599
once grew on dry land as well.

131
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:16,078
The green turtle, too,
returned to the sea.

132
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,131
Of course, every once in a while,
they have to come up for air.

133
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:53,574
From the sea to the shores,
and back to the sea.

134
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:57,050
Sea turtles lay their eggs on the beach.

135
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:54,304
Hatched by night, baby sea turtles
can make it to the water, no problem.

136
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:59,715
But born in broad daylight,
it's a different story.

137
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:14,854
One in a thousand may reach the sea,
enough for the species to carry on.

138
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:21,464
Baby turtles don't make much of a meal
for frigatebirds,

139
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:25,323
so they share an entrÃ©e
with the sailfish.

140
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,935
There is more than sharing
going on in the ocean.

141
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,644
Some species depend on one another.

142
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,548
Immune to the paralyzing venom
of the sea anemone,

143
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:21,490
clownfish hide in her tentacles.

144
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:41,845
Down here, it's like nature
has given everything a try.

145
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:47,478
Every color,

146
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,355
every way of life,

147
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,655
every shape.

148
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:31,787
Now, the venomous stonefish
isn't very fast or agile.

149
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:43,166
But patience and disguise
make him a fearsome predator.

150
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:01,620
The lionfish goes still and silent
when he's hungry.

151
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:16,667
Both make fast food of damselfish.

152
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,515
Big fish eat little fish,

153
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,127
but not always, and not everywhere.

154
00:41:56,713 --> 00:42:00,205
There are fish-operated grooming stations
under the sea

155
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,945
with patient customers
and busy cleaners.

156
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,318
As tempting as it may be,

157
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:10,756
it's never a good idea
to swallow your dental hygienist.

158
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,807
Some need a whole team

159
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,069
for a full-body scrub.

160
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,248
Sweetlips just needs a touchup.

The ribbon eeI can come unraveled.

162
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,937
The cuttlefish is a master of illusion.

After the magic show,

164
00:43:56,466 --> 00:44:00,926
time for a garden eeI
and a razorfish ballet.

165
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,903
Like soldiers marching into battle,

166
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:13,333
spider-crab battalions face off
in Australia's Melbourne Bay.

167
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:44,700
There's a time to dance, a time to fight.

168
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,293
There is also a season for traveI.

169
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,307
Humpbacks set out
on their long journey

170
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:56,105
to their summer feeding grounds
near the polar regions.

171
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:20,460
The blue whale, the largest animal
in the history of the world,

172
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,834
is on the move as well.

173
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,910
The ocean sunfish is a vagabond

174
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:39,886
who doesn't mind a few horse mackerel
tagging along for company.

175
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:49,891
The blue shark's passenger
is a stowaway.

176
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:58,263
Sperm whales gather in families.

177
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,143
when the males grow up,

178
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,807
they leave their mothers
and traveI on their own.

179
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:36,401
A cloud of shad rides in the wake
of a whale shark

180
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,878
as he roams the open ocean

181
00:48:39,015 --> 00:48:42,781
for as long as they can
stay away from his mouth.

182
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:04,637
The yellowfin tuna
can make some serious time,

183
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:09,837
speeding through the ocean
from east to west and west to east.

184
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:42,635
Dolphins are more acrobatic.

185
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:47,846
They race, feed, leap and play,
seemingly all at once.

186

Hang on tight. It's gonna be quite a ride.

187
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:18,206
As the sun sets over Costa Rican waters,
the dolphins are still living it up.

188
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:24,507
All that strength and energy depend
on a healthy, thriving and resilient ocean.

189
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:42,960
One good sign of health for our oceans
is the mere existence of older fish,

190
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:47,536
like this Asian sheepshead wrasse
in the China Sea.

191
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:55,441
To wear that mask of wisdom,

192
00:51:55,578 --> 00:52:00,379
you have to survive in unspoiled waters
for a very long time.

193
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:22,563
Of course, if you've seen
one elderly Asian sheepshead wrasse,

194
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:24,673
you've seen them all.

195
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,709
There are still unspoiled places

196
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,341
where the sea is wild and clean.

197
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:20,694
There are places
where every strange face tells a story,

198
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:24,824
with some unexpected twists.

199
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:49,557
There are places
where winged dragons really do exist.

200
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,427
The leafy sea dragon lives his whole life

201
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,697
in the same patch of water
at the same depth.

202
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:18,116
Try to move him and he'll die.

203
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:32,056

no makeup or costumes needed.

204
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,917
when it comes to more practical matters
like using tools,

205
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,456
the sea otter is front and center.

206
00:54:55,592 --> 00:55:01,428
They use rocks to crack open shells
and get at the tender morseI inside

207
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:05,000
while soaking up the rays
in Monterey Bay.

208
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:17,940
The sea provides not only food
and shelter, but wide-open spaces.

209
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,593
So every community is free to swim

210
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:47,267
just as far as their flippers or feet
or fins will take them.

211
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:58,386
Alaskan feeding grounds
still await our weary travelers.

212
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:08,161
A few orcas live here all year round.

213
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:24,369
After thousands of miles,
the humpbacks finally arrive.

214
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:32,477
Here, the fishing is good,
and there's plenty of room to live large.

215
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:41,452
They make bubbles in the water
to form a fishing net.

216
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,363
when everything's ready,
a cry rings out,

217
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:50,438
and it's time for the feast.

218
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,989
Human nets are not made of bubbles.

219
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,494
The great bluefin tuna
of the Mediterranean

220
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,129
is now in danger of extinction.

221
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,342

and bottom trawling,

of unwanted creatures

their destination.

of one human lifetime

229
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,147
countless species
have been threatened,

230
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,990
the ocean fights on.

231

And anyone who knows the sea
will tell you of her power.

232
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:47,889

and we take her temperature.

And when she hurts,
we can measure her pain.

Using satellite imagery,

01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:20,349
you can see how pollution
runs out of rivers,

239

or a new place to survive.

Human indifference
is surely the ocean's greatest threat.

245
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:29,150
Yet even now,
at opposite poles of the Earth,

01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:32,419

247
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:45,638
The leopard seal still reigns supreme
in the Antarctic.

Though as figure skaters,
they leave something to be desired.
