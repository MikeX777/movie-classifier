1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,600
<i>September 10th, 1989. Kita-Kyushu.</i>

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,300
<i>After finishing his five year jail term for murder,
ex-gangster Yasuo Matsumura returned to his hometown.</i>

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,100
<i>Yasuo was then forced to shoot and kill six people
and later turned the gun on himself.</i>

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,200
<i>He had no right arm.</i>

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,700
<i>His sister Yuri and his
childhood friend Kenji Shiraishi,</i>

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,450
<i>who allegedly were both with Yasuo on the
day of the massacre, disappeared shortly after.</i>

7
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,950
<i>Ten long years have passed since then.</i>

8
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,650
Move!

9
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:53,875
Disposal fee.

10
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,600
Let's go.

11
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:56,400
Gotta pee.

12
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,600
<i>Over here.</i>

13
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,525
Why the kid?

14
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,400
His dad died.
I'll look after him.

15
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,675
Kids fetch double.

16
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,550
He's not for sale.

17
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:33,375
No head for business, huh?

18
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,500
What about him?

19
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,775
I'll take him with me.

20
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,975
- I'll go cash out.
- Okay.

21
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,350
Kenji!

22
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,050
Yuri.

23
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:56,675
Yu-ri.

24
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,225
Yuri.

25
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,500
Good.

26
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,500
Kenji.

27
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,850
Kenji.

28
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,800
Yuri.

29
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,100
Kenji.

30
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,875
Your name?

31
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,200
Yuri.

32
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,300
Kenji.

33
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,100
Achun.

34
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,950
Very good! You got it!
So you're Achun, huh?

35
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,650
Here, want another?

36
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:11,575
Your leaving? Really?

37
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,550
Take care!

38
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,300
Don't talk like that.

39
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:39,750
Next time you see my brother, Yasuo,
tell him to hurry home.

40
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,000
Tell him I'll be waiting with Kenji.

41
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,750
You like birds, too?

42
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,750
I wish I could fly away.

43
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,250
<i>Come on, get out.</i>

44
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,800
<i>You as well, move it!</i>

45
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,200
<i>Not yet.</i>

46
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,200
<i>Hold on.</i>

47
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:26,225
I want you... to shoot him.

48
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,800
Hold still please!

49
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:31,650
Go on, shoot!

50
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:33,325
Here it comes!

51
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,850
Do it, shoot!

52
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,550
It's coming!

53
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,575
Was it you who took the child?

54
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,500
When he gets this tall,
bring him back.

55
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,050
Understand?

56
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,450
Next time you interfere with
our brethren, you die.

57
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,950
In fact, I'll kill you myself.

58
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,125
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

59
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,850
<i>Don't you recognize me, man?</i>

60
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,625
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

61
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:16,825
<i>What's up? Busy working?
Cut the crap.</i>

62
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:19,275
<i>None of your business.</i>

63
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,650
I'm in Tokyo.

64
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm a trainee in construction.
Doesn't mean much, though.

65
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:30,900
- Shigeo, who you talking to?
- What?

66
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,250
- Your girl?
- No, an old pal.

67
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,300
- Shigeo...
- What?

68
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
They got western toilets here?

69
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,950
How should I know!
Just go already!

70
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,400
Where are you living?

71
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,925
Don't tell me the ward.
That doesn't help me.

72
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,325
I only know five of them.

73
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:53,000
Moji, Kokura, Wakamatsu, Tobata
and Yahata, my hometown.

74
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
What?

75
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,625
The Tokyo Line?
Where do I catch that?

76
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,450
Shibuya? That ain't a ward.

77
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:04,605
Yeah, I'm coming to see you.

78
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,550
Just meet me at the station.

79
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,200
How many stops?

80
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,325
Your pad, huh?

81
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,075
Just sit anywhere.

82
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,925
Guess I'll have to.

83
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,851
Can I use this?

84
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,275
- What?
- This is much better.

85
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,700
That's mine.

86
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:25,400
Can goes on the table...

87
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,575
Right then.

88
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:29,850
Hang this up.

89
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,850
Just hold on a second.

90
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,125
Hurry up.

91
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,775
Wait, don't you have
anything better?

92
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,725
No, I don't.

93
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,450
It'll flatten the shoulders.

94
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,975
I don't believe this.

95
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:50,725
That's your starter?

96
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:51,950
What?

97
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,650
Vodka?

98
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,500
- That okay?
- Yeah, fine.

99
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,300
- What the hell were you expecting?
- Here.

100
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,875
Look how low your TV is.
Must be hard to watch.

101
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,050
Shigeo...

102
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,825
- Come on, let's toast.
- Huh?

103
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:14,650
It's been a while.

104
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:16,600
Long time, no see.

105
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,025
I should change my clothes.

106
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,550
Sitting on the floor like this...
my suit will wrinkle.

107
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,275
Got anything to wear?

108
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,600
Lend me these sweat pants.

109
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,750
Fine, whatever.

110
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,900
Pain in the arse.

111
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,175
- Hey!
- Yes?

112
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,825
Hang this up, too.

113
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:49,750
Yes.

114
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,450
Catch.

115
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:55,725
Forget the sweatshirt,
it's too hot.

116
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,325
Hang this up as well.

117
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,825
- Suits don't suit you, Shigeo.
- Shut up.

118
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,750
Those new glasses?

119
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,250
Look good, huh?

120
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,825
From "Optical World".

121
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:22,000
How's Mr. Sawai?

122
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,500
- Didn't you hear?
- What?

123
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:32,500
Poor Mr. Sawai... died last March.

124
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,775
Soon after Kozue's graduation.

125
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,500
Really?

126
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,400
Got any beer?

127
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,075
I hear you and Naoki are pen pals.

128
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,800
Pen pals?

129
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,925
Well, we write to each
other that's all.

130
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,750
How is "writing to each other"
different from "pen pals"?

131
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,550
Am I speaking the
wrong dialect here?

132
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,250
No, but who says "pen..."?

133
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,875
Who cares? I've a right to say
"pen pals" if I want to.

134
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:19,475
Fine. Say it then.

135
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,400
- Well, what'd he say?
- Huh?

136
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,000
What did Naoki write about?

137
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,975
Just stuff. Nothing special.

138
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,150
He never mentioned Mr. Sawai.

139
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:36,250
Well, after his death,
Kozue just upped and vanished.

140
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,075
What? Why?

141
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:43,400
If I knew that,
I wouldn't be looking.

142
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,100
You're looking for her?

143
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,250
Well, I gotta at least know
where she is.

144
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:56,350
Mr. Sawai was like a father
to Kozue, you know.

145
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,900
Do you have any leads?

146
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,075
Nope.

147
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:03,975
How did you expect to find her, then?

148
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,200
Damned if I know.

149
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,900
You piss me off.
I'm searching like crazy here.

150
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,925
What did I do?

151
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:14,600
I don't know. It's like I
don't see you for ages and...

152
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,075
you haven't changed a bit.
Not one bit.

153
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,550
No growth, man.
None at all.

154
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,200
You know?

155
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:26,225
Sorry.

156
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,950
- Did you just say "sorry"?
- Yeah.

157
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,050
Okay, then. I want you to say
"Let me join up".

158
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:44,050
- Put this on first. Don't argue, just do it.
- What? Hang on...

159
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,950
Put it on quick!
Put it on!

160
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,975
First you put on that tie.
And then you say...

161
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,775
- I have to tie it?
- Tie it.

162
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,425
Want me to smack you?

163
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:58,175
- You're such a pain in the ass!
- Just get on with it.

164
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:01,075
This is so backwater Kita Kyushu!

165
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:03,525
I don't care. Just do it.

166
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,875
- Like this?
- Yeah, but tighten it up. Okay now say...

167
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,750
"Let me join up!"

168
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:15,200
- Why?
- Hurry up, man. Say "Let me join up!"

169
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,425
Let me join up.

170
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:18,725
- Louder.
- Let me join up!

171
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:20,650
Okay, then.
You're in.

172
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,725
In what?

173
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,850
The "Kozue Search Party".

174
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,775
What's that?

175
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,075
Well, I'm sure she's
somewhere in Kyushu.

176
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:38,325
You want me to go to Kyushu?

177
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:42,575
Damn right! It's your duty
as a search party member.

178
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,875
What did you expect, you idiot!

179
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:48,625
But I'm busy. I've got work.

180
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:51,575
What kind of excuse is that?

181
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,100
Kozue could be lying in the street
somewhere. You're her cousin!

182
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,375
She took off of her
own free will, right?

183
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:04,700
No, she didn't.
Don't be an idiot.

184
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,250
Then what?

185
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,975
Beats me.

186
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,200
What do you know?

187
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,350
If you hang out back home,
you start to hear rumors.

188
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,950
Like what?

189
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,400
Not sure.

190
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,025
You don't know anything,
do you, Shigeo.

191
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,925
No.

192
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,175
What? Why the sudden humility?

193
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:44,250
What's with your hair? Looks like
something from a comic book.

194
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,400
Well, it's not.

195
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,800
Sure it is. What's that
comic book character?

196
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,275
You know.

197
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,900
No, I don't.

198
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,600
What's the name of it?
I forget.

199
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,900
It's got that guy with the hair
who says, "Evening, folks!"

200
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,600
"Evening folks"?
What comic is that?

201
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:01,500
"Mamiya Transporters"

202
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,750
Excuse me.

203
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:21,350
I heard you were hiring.

204
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,025
From whom?

205
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:28,625
A man named Matsuoka.

206
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,625
Matsuoka... the policeman?

207
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,875
"Kozue Tamura, 18."

208
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,400
You in school?

209
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,875
I graduated this year.

210
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,775
I can't pay much.

211
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:12,425
I don't mind.
I'd like the work.

212
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:17,725
You have a place to stay?

213
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,663
I see.

214
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:30,275
It's no company dormitory but
there is a room out back.

215
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:32,575
Care to look?

216
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,850
<i>Without leaving so much as a memory</i>

217
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:05,325
<i>My summer meanders on</i>

218
00:30:06,475 --> 00:30:12,275
<i>Into tomorrow</i>

219
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,050
Hey, Yoshie.

220
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:25,175
I'm Ono. I work in the dining room.

221
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:27,700
How do you do.
I'm Kozue Tamura.

222
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Pleased to meet you.

223
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,875
Hello there! I'm Kijima,
one time physician.

224
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:36,500
I can't drive a truck but
they keep me on anyway.

225
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,200
Dr. Kijima's sort of the glue
holding everybody together.

226
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:43,500
That lump over there is Mr. Sone.

227
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,250
Welcome back.

228
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,575
Gotoh, meet Ms. Tamura,
our new help.

229
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:51,275
There are three more
who you'll meet later.

230
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,000
Another newbie, huh?

231
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:59,725
Why not? The old men here
just sit around all day.

232
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,750
Don't mind him.
He's always like that.

233
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,875
Okay?

234
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:09,068
- Let me help.
- Thank you.

235
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,850
Thank you. Good night.

236
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,650
- Hey, are you tonight's designated driver?
- Yes.

237
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,475
- I'm finishing up. Bring my car around?
- Okay, yes.

238
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,825
Excuse me.

239
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,725
Anymore rides tonight?

240
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,050
No, you're the last.

241
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:47,200
Oh.

242
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,750
You're extremely quiet.

243
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:57,275
I'm sorry.

244
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,150
Why apologize?

245
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:06,825
Most drivers won't shut up.
Comes from standing around for so long.

246
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:12,975
Then again, too quiet can
be a little creepy.

247
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:14,425
I'm sorry.

248
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,100
Right then!

249
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:34,425
- See me to the elevator.
- Sure.

250
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:58,625
Thanks. You can't be too careful.

251
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,650
Can you do this on a monthly basis?

252
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,875
Sure.

253
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:05,175
Three days a week.

254
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,950
I'm afraid Fridays are busy for me.

255
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,100
I see.

256
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:12,150
But maybe I can work it in somehow.

257
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,125
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.

258
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,625
Thank you.

259
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,835
By the way, I'm Saeko.
Saeko Shiina.

260
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,750
Kenji Shiraishi.

261
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,050
Well, good night.

262
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,625
Wait. Your car keys.

263
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:28,325
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

264
00:33:28,525 --> 00:33:29,725
Good night.

265
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:19,525
What? You hungry?

266
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,700
Achun, here.

267
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:48,075
Let's see this.

268
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:53,025
Eat up.

269
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,600
Hear that?

270
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,775
<i>- Tastes good.
- Huh?</i>

271
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,350
<i>Tastes good.</i>

272
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,375
<i>Tastes good?</i>

273
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,500
I'm diggin' in.

274
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:38,998
<i>A bunny rabbit!</i>

275
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,800
<i>Cute...</i>

276
00:36:55,675 --> 00:37:00,350
- I'm terribly sorry. I didn't expect this to happen.
- No, don't worry about it.

277
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,825
I'm not used to drinking. It didn't
take much to get me drunk. Sorry.

278
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:08,425
- That's quite alright. Are you ready?
- Yes.

279
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,800
Did you get my address?

280
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes, but I'm afraid I'll need your
help as we get closer.

281
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Okay.

282
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,650
You a bachelor?

283
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,750
Yes.

284
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:33,300
- That's admirable. A lone wolf, huh?
- Not really...

285
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,900
From around here?

286
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
No.

287
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,350
Where?

288
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,400
Erm... from Hakata.

289
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,450
Really? Me, too.

290
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,500
My wife's from Moji.

291
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,850
Is that so?

292
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,600
The place has really developed.

293
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,200
Lots of western style
hotels and apartments.

294
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,850
It sure has.

295
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,650
But my wife doesn't care for it.
Won't go near the place.

296
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,000
- Thank you.
- No problem.

297
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,200
Come in for a moment.

298
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
One more game, Doc.

299
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,800
You're unbeatable, Doc!

300
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,200
We'll all do better in our
next life, right Gotoh?

301
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,600
Hey, everybody!

302
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,800
This is...

303
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,600
Come in!

304
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:51,925
This man drove me home from Kokura.

305
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,000
Someone give him a lift back.

306
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,050
No, there's really no need...

307
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,800
- I'll do it.
- Not you, Kozue.

308
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,350
- I'll call a cab.
- No, no.

309
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,950
Come on! Someone volunteer.

310
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,000
- Here.
- Huh?

311
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,500
- She okay?
- Yes, of course. I'm much obliged.

312
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,850
Thank you.

313
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,550
Oh, right.
I need to pay you.

314
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,350
Hey, Chiyoko!

315
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:34,575
Chiyoko!

316
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,300
I need money to pay the driver.

317
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,300
How much?

318
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,900
6,000 yen.

319
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,100
I'm so sorry.

320
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
- Sorry to keep you waiting, thanks again.
- Thanks.

321
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,000
Here we go.

322
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,375
Excuse me.

323
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,050
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

324
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:34,875
Can I change my destination?

325
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,850
- Sure.
- Good.

326
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,875
I appreciate it.

327
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:50,575
Can I ask if your mother is well?

328
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,300
I wouldn't know.

329
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,400
Ran away?

330
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,800
Yes.

331
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,475
But not me. She did.

332
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:10,550
My mom left me and my dad, too.

333
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,250
She's still alive.

334
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,950
Forgive me for prying.

335
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,525
Thank you.

336
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:47,339
Something wrong?

337
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,200
Not really...

338
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,875
Just wanted to see me?

339
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:02,084
Look how bashful you are!

340
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,150
Come on, out with it.
I hate brooding men.

341
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:16,175
We only just met the other day.

342
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:17,725
I just saw my mother.

343
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,000
She abandoned my father and
me when I was a kid.

344
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,400
- Did you speak?
- No, I just saw her.

345
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,200
And your father?

346
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,300
Dead. He hung himself.

347
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,100
Maybe you should speak to her.

348
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:50,903
I suddenly felt like seeing you.

349
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,475
I was thinking of you, too.

350
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:03,082
Kenji Shiraishi.

351
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,325
At my age...

352
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,426
who needs a mother?

353
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,350
Then what's the problem?

354
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,450
I hated her to death.

355
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,209
When you were a kid, right?

356
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,000
Saeko Shiina.

357
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,900
You're funny.

358
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,775
- What does that mean?
- Nothing...

359
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,625
Thirsty?

360
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,580
I'd better go.

361
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,289
What time do I pick you up?

362
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,050
You really are different, aren't you?

363
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,500
No one's accused me of that before.

364
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,050
I have a hair appointment at 4.

365
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,150
Can I borrow your car
while you're there?

366
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,750
Be my guest.

367
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:35,650
Apart from looking after
a Chinese orphan, I'm pretty ordinary.

368
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,550
So I can't live with you now,
though I'd like to.

369
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,900
- What's so funny?
- Say what?

370
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,600
Well, whatever.
I'll see you.

371
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,300
Rain, huh?

372
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,450
Pouring, too.

373
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:36,250
Rain.

374
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,750
Here, look.

375
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,250
Rain.

376
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:49,875
- Rain.
- That's right.

377
00:45:51,775 --> 00:45:53,275
What else.

378
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,550
Sky.

379
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,475
Sky.

380
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,925
<i>Dad, mum.</i>

381
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:07,326
<i>Dad, mum.</i>

382
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,125
What's that your saying?

383
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:16,500
<i>Dad, mum and Achun.</i>

384
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,800
I see.

385
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,975
You've nothing to be sad about.

386
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,400
Kenji... Achun.

387
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,900
- Kenji... Achun.
- That's right, me and Achun.

388
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,450
And Kyu-chan.

389
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,625
Welcome home.

390
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,475
I'm soaked.

391
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:26,425
Go help your father in the office.

392
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:31,500
I'm going out.

393
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,054
Why? Can't you at least
stay home when it rains?

394
00:47:35,154 --> 00:47:38,054
You told me I should get out more.

395
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,750
Make plans to help out
all day Saturday, then.

396
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,535
It sure is pouring down.

397
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,550
Who's car is that?

398
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,400
Huh?

399
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,550
- Go see.
- Okay.

400
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,400
I think it's the man who
drove me home last night.

401
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,050
Why would he come back here?

402
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,775
I could be wrong.

403
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,450
What are you doing?

404
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,275
Going home.

405
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:39,375
I see.

406
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:50,925
What's his name?

407
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,075
The Chinese boy.

408
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,925
Achun.

409
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,125
Achun...

410
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,000
What a drag.

411
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,650
Being with me is a drag?

412
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,679
I didn't mean you.

413
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:22,750
Forget it.
You'd better hurry home.

414
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,475
I killed a person once.

415
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,850
Liar.

416
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:44,200
I beat two people with a frying pan.

417
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,275
I can still feel the pain in my hand.

418
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,250
Why would you do that?

419
00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:58,625
I don't know.

420
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,850
Things just got out of hand.

421
00:51:04,425 --> 00:51:05,925
Were you caught?

422
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,450
My childhood friend was a yakuza.

423
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:15,050
He shot some people.
I managed to get away.

424
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:19,325
Then you didn't kill them?

425
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:22,525
But I tried to, you see.

426
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:25,675
Yasuo just finished what I had started.

427
00:51:26,775 --> 00:51:29,975
Yasuo, your yakuza friend?

428
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,775
Well, I don't care.

429
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,625
About what?

430
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:54,525
I still want to be with you.

431
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:06,625
Well I'm probably no good for you.

432
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,150
Why tell me that now?

433
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,600
Stop that.

434
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:27,775
That hurts!

435
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,050
There's something I've gotta do.

436
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,250
So go do it!

437
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,000
Will you wait for me
until it's done?

438
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,700
Will you?

439
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,325
What's your mother's name?

440
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:55,925
I forget.

441
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,050
Will you come back if I do wait?

442
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,050
Yeah.

443
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,050
Is your mom about?

444
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,850
Who're you?

445
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,600
Call your mom.

446
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,650
Tell me who you are first.

447
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,800
Tough guy, huh?

448
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,650
Yusuke, who is it?

449
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:19,125
Get to school, Yusuke.

450
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,100
My little brother's tough, unlike me.

451
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:36,000
Won't you come in?

452
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:47,475
How's it going?

453
00:54:48,725 --> 00:54:53,650
They just sit facing each other,
not saying a word.

454
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,700
Is he really Chiyoko's son?

455
00:54:57,975 --> 00:55:01,925
Don't know.
I've never met him before.

456
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,000
Well...

457
00:55:08,425 --> 00:55:12,825
parent or no parent, we're all
on our own as adults.

458
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,550
Is Chiyoko crying?

459
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,600
No... she's actually smiling.

460
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:31,550
I knew immediately.

461
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,700
Yes, you've said that.

462
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,300
I guess I have.

463
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,450
I thought it was you when
I saw you yesterday.

464
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,800
At that distance?

465
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,000
No, but soon after you left.
Once I'd thought about it.

466
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,050
Know about Yasuo?

467
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,950
Yes, I read about it...

468
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,000
in the paper.

469
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,050
Did you read about dad, too?

470
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:13,050
Were you involved in Yasuo's crime?

471
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,450
What about Yuri?

472
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,900
- She's his sister, right?
- I'm still taking care of her.

473
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:25,850
- You were involved.
- It's none of your business.

474
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:33,550
It happened on the day
your father died, right?

475
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,000
I heard you'd run off
and hadn't been seen.

476
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,000
- I prayed you weren't a part of it.
- From wherever that was.

477
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:50,600
- Have you come to express your hatred for me?
- What would that do?

478
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,075
If so, I'm saddened to see
what a small man you've become.

479
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:56,675
Pretty harsh.

480
00:56:59,825 --> 00:57:01,500
Can I fix you some food?

481
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,950
Sit down.

482
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,150
I'll listen to your complaints,
don't worry.

483
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,050
Then sit down!

484
00:57:15,575 --> 00:57:17,700
Yuri's in a facility.

485
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:20,925
She thinks Yasuo will
return someday.

486
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,400
And I'm caring for a
Chinese boy named Achun.

487
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:29,500
I've done some "transporting"
work myself.

488
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,100
I took him before he could be sold.

489
00:57:37,175 --> 00:57:39,375
You want me to look after them?

490
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,075
Only if you live here, too.

491
00:57:44,175 --> 00:57:45,475
Don't be ridiculous.

492
00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:49,600
Why not? This is my home.

493
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:55,450
Mamiya would certainly understand
having a step-son around.

494
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,450
How about your son?

495
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:03,325
He's known since he was little
that he has a big brother.

496
00:58:03,425 --> 00:58:05,625
He knew he'd meet you someday.

497
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:09,575
What a horrible mom.

498
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,200
You don't know anything.

499
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,850
Dad said the same before he died.

500
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,250
What?

501
00:58:19,925 --> 00:58:22,025
"You don't know anything."

502
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,675
I suppose to a parent,
a kid can never escape that.

503
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,475
That's right. You'll always be
a child to me.

504
00:58:38,225 --> 00:58:39,475
Where are you going?

505
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,625
Home.

506
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,775
But you'll live with us?

507
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:45,475
I'll think about it.

508
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,500
What are you doing?

509
01:01:03,925 --> 01:01:05,850
You shoplifting that?

510
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,225
None of your business.

511
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,875
Return it, will you?

512
01:01:13,925 --> 01:01:15,475
If you screw me.

513
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,925
- Huh?
- What's your problem?

514
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,050
- Hey, stop that!
- Take off!

515
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,700
Get back here, you!

516
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,550
Run for it Yamamuro!
Run!

517
01:01:39,675 --> 01:01:41,300
- Thanks.
- Good night.

518
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,100
Dear! You don't have to hit him!

519
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:01,350
I never imagined you
could be this stupid!

520
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:03,575
Get up!

521
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,025
I said get up!

522
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,425
Oh, Kenjii...

523
01:02:18,525 --> 01:02:21,572
Let me go. This is the only
thing he'll understand.

524
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:24,125
He understands,
don't you, Yusuke?

525
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:26,800
Well? Answer your brother!

526
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,300
- Take it easy.
- Hey!

527
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:13,025
Good night.

528
01:03:13,225 --> 01:03:14,425
Tamura.

529
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,800
You in love with Kenji?

530
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,050
Don't be silly.

531
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:30,225
I advise against getting
too close to anyone here.

532
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:33,200
Don't disturb the peace.

533
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:38,125
But Yusuke was...

534
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:40,925
It's still not your business.

535
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,200
You should've just ignored it.

536
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,550
Sorry.

537
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:52,300
Well, you don't seem like
you'll stay here long, anyway.

538
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:55,439
Forget it. Good night.

539
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,500
Good morning.

540
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,100
Oh, good morning!

541
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,650
- What's that?
- Bacon and eggs.

542
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,150
Great. That's my favorite.

543
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,075
- It'll be ready soon.
- Okay.

544
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:48,775
Kenji, come here.

545
01:04:59,425 --> 01:05:02,850
My husband's in bed
with a high fever.

546
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,125
He is?

547
01:05:04,225 --> 01:05:07,225
Yeah, he's worthless today.

548
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:14,200
Would you take over for him?
Get someone else to do your rounds.

549
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,925
What about Doc Kijima?

550
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:17,325
I'd rather you do it.

551
01:05:17,425 --> 01:05:18,700
Why?

552
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:19,650
Morning!

553
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,250
- Good Morning.
- Morning.

554
01:05:23,475 --> 01:05:24,485
Alright!

555
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:33,600
You know Yusuke can't handle it.
You're the only one I can count on.

556
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,000
What's that mean?

557
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:43,000
If it weren't for liquor, your father
would've been a very capable man.

558
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:46,825
Don't take to drinking, you hear.

559
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,700
What are you saying?

560
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:58,950
I'm saying I want you to take over
the business.

561
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,550
You're joking.
What about Mamiya?

562
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,825
He wouldn't object in the least.

563
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,000
He's too much of a softie
to be successful.

564
01:06:12,775 --> 01:06:15,100
You prefer a wife beater like Dad?

565
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,100
Don't be stupid.

566
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:19,900
Good morning.

567
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,100
Morning.

568
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,900
Thanks for everything
yesterday, Kozue.

569
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,150
No, I'm sorry.
It wasn't my place to interfere.

570
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,750
Don't be silly.
You were a great help.

571
01:06:30,975 --> 01:06:32,250
I'm counting on you, Kenji.

572
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,425
Okay, everyone drive carefully.

573
01:06:44,525 --> 01:06:45,975
Have a good one.

574
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:47,325
See you.

575
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:02,625
Gotoh, could you give my mom
and Yusuke a lift?

576
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:10,350
- You're a good man, Kenji.
- What do you mean?

577
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:13,400
You seem good,
but a little scary.

578
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,950
How so?

579
01:07:15,475 --> 01:07:20,075
Losers like us either follow or
run from guys like you.

580
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,500
Who's there?

581
01:08:40,925 --> 01:08:42,075
It's Kenji.

582
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:52,950
How do you feel?

583
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,575
The fever just won't break.

584
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,750
Can I get you anything?

585
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:03,400
No, I've caused you enough
trouble already.

586
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,200
I don't mind, really.

587
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,550
Please, you need to rest.

588
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,700
I'm feeling a bit better
now that everyone's out.

589
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,500
Mr. Mamiya...

590
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,650
What keeps you going?

591
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,300
What do you mean?

592
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,050
Ever been betrayed?

593
01:09:49,775 --> 01:09:50,975
By whom?

594
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:55,400
Your employees.
They're all drifters.

595
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,050
I have on occasion.

596
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,725
Can you trust them?

597
01:10:01,825 --> 01:10:03,525
Not really.

598
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,775
Then why?

599
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:10,100
You should know very well why.

600
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
If I closed shop, they'd have
nowhere to go.

601
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,400
Maybe so, but...

602
01:10:19,825 --> 01:10:23,175
Like Yuri and Achun.

603
01:10:23,425 --> 01:10:27,375
Without you, where would they go?

604
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,975
What keeps you from
abandoning them?

605
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,250
Well, that's how it is.

606
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:57,175
Good one.

607
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:16,400
Soap bubbles. Don't see
those much these days.

608
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:23,150
I wish I could float away like that.

609
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,750
Who's winning?

610
01:11:47,325 --> 01:11:49,400
The Doc. Who else?

611
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,100
How would you know?
You know nothing but baseball.

612
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:56,950
Get out here Kenji!

613
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:00,300
Yusuke's leaving!
Yusuke, wait!

614
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:05,000
Yusuke, get back here!

615
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:08,400
- Yusuke!
- Get away from me, hag!

616
01:12:09,275 --> 01:12:10,475
Yusuke, don't.

617
01:12:10,575 --> 01:12:12,725
- Stay out of this.
- I can't.

618
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,950
Out of my way!

619
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,425
Get back inside.

620
01:12:17,525 --> 01:12:18,850
Screw you!

621
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:23,325
You just work here.
Butt out!

622
01:12:23,425 --> 01:12:24,800
Yusuke!

623
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,950
Problem settled!

624
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:36,375
We owe our lives to
your folks, you know.

625
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,900
We're not ordinary employees.

626
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:42,075
Everyone back inside.

627
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,750
Impressive.

628
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,250
The boy is hopeless.

629
01:13:42,825 --> 01:13:44,725
He's your child, isn't he?

630
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,900
I'll rely on you now.

631
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,575
Abandoning a son again?

632
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,675
I haven't abandoned anyone.

633
01:13:56,825 --> 01:13:59,975
You abandoned me!
Admit it!

634
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,900
You're right.

635
01:14:06,925 --> 01:14:08,925
I had it coming.

636
01:14:31,975 --> 01:14:34,825
My leaving would restore the peace.

637
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:37,600
No, it wouldn't.

638
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,500
Please stay.

639
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,275
Surprised?

640
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,750
Give me a smoke.

641
01:15:37,475 --> 01:15:39,400
You're in shipping, huh?

642
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,300
You like being a transporter?

643
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:46,475
I'm coming for the child.

644
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:50,350
Japanese can't raise kids right.

645
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:52,100
I'm doing all right.

646
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,050
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

647
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,350
That's not what I meant.

648
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,050
What's this, you've
grown fond of the child?

649
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,850
Not really...

650
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,575
Huh?

651
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:13,550
A child needs a mother.

652
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:19,150
Japanese women aren't good mothers.

653
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,150
The fathers are worse.

654
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,450
Chinese are better?
Murderers are better?

655
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:36,975
What do people need most?

656
01:16:38,475 --> 01:16:41,500
The will to survive, right?

657
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:44,825
That may be so in China.

658
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:49,825
Your problem is you believe in
some beautiful ideal world.

659
01:16:50,075 --> 01:16:53,675
Take a look around and show me
where that exists.

660
01:16:55,725 --> 01:16:58,875
What ideal world?
I don't even believe in parents.

661
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,700
Kenji, playing hooky?

662
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,800
This your route today, Gotoh?

663
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,475
Come here.

664
01:17:48,225 --> 01:17:49,750
Know what that is?

665
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,300
Do you know where it came from?

666
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:35,450
What do you mean?

667
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:42,400
It drifted here from Hawaii.
Unbelievable.

668
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:48,075
From here to Yamaguchi Prefecture,
all Hawaiian coral.

669
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Really? I didn't know that.

670
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,950
Huge masses of it drifted here.

671
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:59,750
I think it actually formed
the Japanese islands.

672
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,500
That's a lot of coral.

673
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,800
No kidding.

674
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,600
We boast about our rich heritage.

675
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:14,100
But it's all just a collection
of stuff from somewhere else.

676
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,100
Kenji, let me show you something.

677
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,725
Okay!

678
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:35,150
Look here.

679
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:42,050
This compass only spins here.

680
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:48,500
My mom was the mistress
of the landlord here.

681
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:53,100
And his family had owned
the land for ages.

682
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,800
Right up until the Meiji Restoration.

683
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:04,425
I plan on exposing its secret
and destroying the myth.

684
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,950
What myth?

685
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:09,875
Japan's origins.

686
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:50,300
Thanks for waiting.

687
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,300
Hey! Now this is a surprise!

688
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,400
I traded shifts.

689
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,500
- So you could see me?
- Be careful! Stop it!

690
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,500
You reek of liquor.

691
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:20,300
I missed you!
Pull over a second.

692
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,900
Okay, okay.

693
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,400
I'm trying to drive here.

694
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,250
People are looking.

695
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,650
Fine. Let them look.

696
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,575
Kenji?

697
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,825
What?

698
01:21:46,925 --> 01:21:48,300
Kenji!

699
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,950
You're heavy.

700
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:53,350
Don't be rude.

701
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:56,450
You wanted to talk?

702
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,800
Guess what...

703
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,200
I'm saving up money.

704
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,550
For what?

705
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,800
For when we live together.

706
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,200
Really.

707
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:11,300
That okay?

708
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:14,200
Living together?

709
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,700
Not sure.

710
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:28,400
I'm talking about with
Yuri and Achun, too.

711
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,100
You've a good memory.

712
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,350
Let's wait just a bit longer.
My thing will be over soon.

713
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:03,150
Well, I won't get my hopes up then.

714
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:16,050
I'll come for you.

715
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,975
Tell me if you change your mind.

716
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,200
Here.

717
01:23:46,575 --> 01:23:48,950
Knock it off.

718
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,450
Yuri, what's wrong?

719
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:21,750
Achun was taken away.

720
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,050
Whose blood?

721
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,400
Nakanishi's.

722
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:27,650
Why Nakanishi?

723
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:32,375
Some guys came and beat him,
then carried him off.

724
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,100
The same ones who took Achun?

725
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:47,600
We're going to bed, Kenji.
Got an early start tomorrow.

726
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,950
Okay. Good night.

727
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:52,350
Could you take Yuri
to her room, Kozue?

728
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,450
Sure.

729
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,350
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

730
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,075
Yuri,

731
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,700
take this with you.

732
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,000
Here.

733
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,600
Thank you.

734
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,700
Can I have a word with you, Kenji?

735
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,750
Thanks.

736
01:25:33,475 --> 01:25:34,475
Here.

737
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,500
It's about Nakanishi.

738
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:44,000
Actually, you could say the same
for all of us here but...

739
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:48,550
Nakanishi was being hounded
by some nasty debt collectors.

740
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:51,600
So we all saw it coming
at some point.

741
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:55,200
But according to Gotoh,
who walked in on it...

742
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:02,100
at first the men only seemed interested
in Achun for some reason.

743
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:06,825
They found Nakanishi,
just by happenstance.

744
01:26:06,925 --> 01:26:08,150
I see.

745
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,350
But what's done is done.
Why dwell on it?

746
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,650
I'm sorry.

747
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,650
You should get to bed, too.

748
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:20,850
With Nakanishi gone,
we're a little short-handed.

749
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:24,675
You're making a long-distance
delivery with the boss tomorrow?

750
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:25,700
That's right.

751
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,100
- Tomorrow evening?
- Yes.

752
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,750
Well, good night.

753
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:34,250
Kenji...

754
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,900
there are no coincidences in life.
We meet who we should meet.

755
01:26:41,175 --> 01:26:43,100
That's how it works.

756
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,800
- I'm sorry.
- Please, don't be.

757
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,450
These kind of things happen here.

758
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:11,350
No they don't. We've never had
anything like this happen before.

759
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:16,150
Well, it's late.
See you in the morning.

760
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:19,700
Kenji, will you be able to
forget about the boy?

761
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:24,425
They spoke Chinese.
He's with his people now.

762
01:27:24,525 --> 01:27:25,950
I know.

763
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:28,225
Where were you?

764
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:29,775
At a friend's.

765
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,475
You have friends?

766
01:27:31,575 --> 01:27:35,450
Let's go to bed. Close up shop
for me, will you Kenji?

767
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,400
Thank you.
Is Yuri asleep?

768
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,900
Yes.

769
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:57,150
But now I can't sleep.

770
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:04,000
Kenji...

771
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,550
I'm looking for my mother, too.

772
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:10,350
You are?

773
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:16,500
I was almost killed once
when I was a kid.

774
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,750
Remember that bus-jacking incident?

775
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,000
I think so, yeah.

776
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:28,700
I don't remember a thing
from that day.

777
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,800
I saw it on the news.

778
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:36,000
But things changed afterwards.

779
01:28:36,825 --> 01:28:39,625
My mom took off one day.

780
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,800
And then my father died
in an accident.

781
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,700
Same here.

782
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,025
Really?

783
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:16,950
If you saw your mom, then what?

784
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,200
I don't know.

785
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,700
I'd like to see her cheerful face.

786
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,150
And then what?

787
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:37,650
What's next for you?

788
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,700
I'm not really sure.

789
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,900
Revenge?

790
01:29:53,575 --> 01:29:55,700
Revenge? How?

791
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:02,350
I think about it sometimes, too.

792
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,600
And?

793
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:13,300
But seeing you living here with
Mrs. Mamiya has made me think.

794
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,950
This is your revenge, isn't it?

795
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,750
Just by your being here...

796
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,750
maybe you're getting back at her.

797
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,550
I wonder if Achun will return
to China.

798
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,200
He has no place to go.

799
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:54,650
Well, good night.

800
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:56,600
Good night.

801
01:31:05,975 --> 01:31:07,250
Kenji?

802
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,050
You don't think people really
need parents, right?

803
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:24,600
Then why would we want
to take revenge on them?

804
01:31:32,725 --> 01:31:34,050
I'm sorry.

805
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:38,400
I'll go to bed now.
Good night.

806
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,900
How nice.

807
01:31:58,825 --> 01:32:00,225
What's nice?

808
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:05,700
I wish I had something in life
worth confiding about.

809
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:09,800
I wouldn't say I do, either.

810
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,175
Yes, you do.

811
01:32:12,575 --> 01:32:14,875
My hopes are with my next life.

812
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,300
Mr. Gotoh, are you scared?

813
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:27,650
Yeah.

814
01:32:28,725 --> 01:32:30,375
They'll come for me next.

815
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:34,050
Then maybe you shouldn't act so
above it all.

816
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,850
What do you know about anything?

817
01:33:45,575 --> 01:33:46,900
Who's there?

818
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,200
Who is it?

819
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:04,000
Yasuo?

820
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,650
That you, Yasuo?

821
01:34:30,775 --> 01:34:31,900
What?

822
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:42,450
Get out of here.

823
01:34:44,275 --> 01:34:47,250
What are you talking about?

824
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,850
Nobody here needs you anymore.

825
01:34:51,825 --> 01:34:54,375
Your parents have forsaken you.

826
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:59,775
Why are you telling me this?

827
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:06,300
I want to see your mother
heartbroken because you're gone.

828
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:10,200
- She's yours, too.
- She's not my mother.

829
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,250
Just a tramp who left her family.

830
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:20,350
Just what are you up to?

831
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:24,650
She shacked up with some young guy.

832
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,900
Left me and my drunken
dad high and dry.

833
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,300
Now it's your turn.

834
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,150
Poor you.

835
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,725
It's useless for you to stay.

836
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,900
I'm not listening to you.

837
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:55,550
I'll be driving to Kanazawa
with your dad today.

838
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,400
Your mom has to visit the police.

839
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:02,700
There's your chance.
Got it?

840
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:07,900
I said, got it?

841
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,200
You're a man, right?

842
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,250
Then try living on your own.

843
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:50,900
Yasuo contacted me yesterday, Yuri.

844
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,500
My brother?

845
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,400
Says he'll be back soon.

846
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:58,200
Really, he said that?
He's coming home?

847
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,175
Soon.

848
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:17,150
Drive carefully.

849
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:21,700
- Have a safe trip, Kenji.
- See you.

850
01:37:50,675 --> 01:37:52,300
- Watch how you go.
- Thanks.

851
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,700
Welcome back.

852
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:57,600
I'm home.

853
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,100
How did it go?

854
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:05,100
The police aren't too sympathetic
to Nakanishi's plight.

855
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,050
I didn't think they would be.

856
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:12,450
Yusuke! Where are you going?

857
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:13,650
Yusuke!

858
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,700
That brat!
He's an embarrassment!

859
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,800
What's wrong?

860
01:39:15,675 --> 01:39:18,800
Yuri! What's the matter?

861
01:39:23,525 --> 01:39:24,900
Oh God.

862
01:39:27,825 --> 01:39:29,350
Was it Yusuke?

863
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,550
Did he do this to you?

864
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:38,550
Tell me, Yuri!
What happened?

865
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,000
Yuri, please!
Snap out of it!

866
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,300
Something wrong?

867
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:54,325
Yusuke ran off.

868
01:39:54,425 --> 01:39:55,450
Seriously?

869
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:59,100
He was probably waiting
for us to leave.

870
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:01,300
Shall I go on without you?

871
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,700
Will you be alright on your own?

872
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:07,075
Well I'll pull over if I get tired.

873
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,600
Ah...

874
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:10,200
sorry about this.

875
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:36,650
Welcome back.
Long drive to take alone.

876
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,650
Is the boss in?

877
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:40,600
No, he's out looking for Yusuke.

878
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:45,300
What's more I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

879
01:40:45,725 --> 01:40:47,375
- Whisky?
- No, I'm fine.

880
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:54,450
The thing is, soon after Yusuke left,
we found Yuri collapsed on the floor.

881
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:55,725
Yuri?

882
01:40:56,750 --> 01:41:01,650
Though I had my license revoked,
I was once a doctor, you know.

883
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:04,425
So I had a look at her.

884
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:06,900
She was raped.

885
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:12,150
She's not there.
She's gone.

886
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:16,250
Chiyoko took her back
to the facility.

887
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,450
Thanks.

888
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:43,650
Welcome home.

889
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,650
I'm impressed.

890
01:42:01,825 --> 01:42:03,125
About what?

891
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:09,350
You lived with Yuri all this time
and nothing ever happened.

892
01:42:10,045 --> 01:42:11,070
Huh?

893
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,525
You never laid a hand on her.

894
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:20,900
I worried about that.

895
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:26,900
I thought she might wake up one day
and find herself pregnant.

896
01:42:31,025 --> 01:42:33,025
And if she did?

897
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,900
Well, that would be fine, too.

898
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,700
Even if the child was like her.

899
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,600
We have this big house.

900
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,850
We could all live happily here.

901
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,750
Of course, you'd need a good wife.

902
01:42:55,075 --> 01:42:58,300
Someone proper enough
to run the household.

903
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:04,650
She'd have to be someone who could
give you all the support you needed.

904
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:10,725
You're a piece of work.

905
01:43:11,225 --> 01:43:12,700
What do you mean?

906
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:19,300
I went to that fancy restaurant
you once worked at.

907
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:24,750
One of the staff there
still remembers you.

908
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,850
I laughed hearing about all
the customers you slept with.

909
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,800
Searching for anyone
that would have you.

910
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,350
This lady on the staff...

911
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,850
mustn't have liked you much.

912
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,825
She had a lot of
negative things to say.

913
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,250
I don't see how you chose a
good man like Mr. Mamiya.

914
01:43:48,925 --> 01:43:52,725
That just doesn't suit you at all,
does it?

915
01:43:53,325 --> 01:43:55,450
You must've duped him good.

916
01:43:57,225 --> 01:44:01,100
- Where were you the day before yesterday?
- What's it to you?

917
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,450
- You have a girlfriend?
- I said, what's it to you?

918
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:07,325
I have to meet my future
daughter-in-law.

919
01:44:07,425 --> 01:44:08,775
Are you nuts?

920
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,750
Yusuke's gone.

921
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:14,250
I've got to make sure you can
comfortably take over the business now.

922
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,850
What world do you live in?

923
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:18,320
This one.

924
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:26,350
Come on, Kenji.
You're the heir, here.

925
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:30,200
Don't make me laugh.
Who would want to live here?

926
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:34,500
I planned it all.
I gave Yusuke his bike key.

927
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,300
I even figured he'd go after Yuri.

928
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,200
But that was fine as long as you felt
what it's like to be abandoned.

929
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:47,075
I did what I came to do.
I've no other use for this place.

930
01:44:47,175 --> 01:44:50,575
And now I'm out of here.
Have a nice life.

931
01:44:50,775 --> 01:44:53,025
You can't leave, Kenji.

932
01:44:53,125 --> 01:44:54,675
Kenji!

933
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:00,525
You were never my mother, got it?

934
01:45:14,325 --> 01:45:16,475
Will you still have me?

935
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:20,550
I told you I'd wait.

936
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:24,400
Yuri's in a nursing facility.

937
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,950
Then bring her here.

938
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:32,275
I'll go check in on her.

939
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,350
Guess what?

940
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:37,875
I'm pregnant.

941
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:51,575
- Hello.
- Thanks for seeing me.

942
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,550
Have a seat.

943
01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:00,725
Thanks.

944
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:09,600
Your mother paid a visit yesterday.

945
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,950
Oh, I see.

946
01:46:13,575 --> 01:46:14,975
She...

947
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:19,375
wants to adopt Yuri.

948
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,000
That's news to me.

949
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:25,200
I see.

950
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:33,225
Either way, Yuri's not ready
to be released yet.

951
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,400
Oh, I see.

952
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:40,650
I'll call you when she is.

953
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,250
I'd appreciate that.

954
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:47,150
So...

955
01:46:47,835 --> 01:46:49,835
Which address should I contact you at?

956
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:52,700
Mamiya or Shiraishi?

957
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,300
Shiraishi.

958
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:02,675
Can you support her?

959
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,500
I think so, yes.

960
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:11,200
Mr. Shiraishi...

961
01:47:12,675 --> 01:47:15,925
Yuri is very unstable right now.

962
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:19,650
I don't expect men to understand.

963
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:25,900
But you don't go back to normal
after what she's been through.

964
01:47:26,335 --> 01:47:27,500
Understand?

965
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,600
Yes.

966
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:38,050
So I'm asking you.
Can you care for her properly?

967
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:41,175
Can you really take responsibility for her?

968
01:47:46,325 --> 01:47:47,400
Yes.

969
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:09,875
What do you want?

970
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:22,700
To kill you.

971
01:49:23,075 --> 01:49:25,525
If you want to hate someone,
hate your mum.

972
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:47,250
Mom would hate to see us
killing each other.

973
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:49,100
Isn't that what you want?

974
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:52,500
That slut is no longer
relevant to me.

975
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,800
You call your own mother a slut?

976
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,825
Give it up.
You can't win.

977
01:50:00,925 --> 01:50:01,950
Enough.

978
01:50:04,275 --> 01:50:07,875
Run home.
Stop worrying your dad.

979
01:50:17,575 --> 01:50:19,875
What's the matter?
What is it?

980
01:50:20,025 --> 01:50:21,600
Please calm down!

981
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,500
Damn you!

982
01:51:06,225 --> 01:51:07,400
Hey!

983
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:10,775
Get up.

984
01:51:13,725 --> 01:51:14,800
Hey!

985
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,975
Not getting up?

986
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:37,275
Shit!

987
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:39,900
Huh!

988
01:52:45,865 --> 01:52:48,325
It's Kenji!

989
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,325
Who's Kenji?

990
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,550
Rest in peace.

991
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:28,450
Thank you.

992
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,425
Is that your funeral wear?

993
01:55:13,935 --> 01:55:14,950
Huh?

994
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,900
I have something for you.

995
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:21,450
Even pregnant, you ought
to be wearing a kimono.

996
01:55:21,865 --> 01:55:22,950
Come.

997
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:14,200
Yes, Mamiya Transporters.

998
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,250
Mr. Gotoh?

999
01:56:19,075 --> 01:56:21,850
There's no one by that name here.

1000
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:24,850
Yes.

1001
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,850
May I ask who's calling?

1002
01:57:41,525 --> 01:57:43,300
It's sure getting cold.

1003
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:45,800
Yeah.

1004
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,450
Looking after yourself?

1005
01:57:50,975 --> 01:57:53,925
- Yes.
- We lucked out! The newspaper...

1006
01:57:54,025 --> 01:57:55,625
Shut up!

1007
01:57:58,775 --> 01:58:00,200
Doesn't matter.

1008
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:05,500
We found Kozue and she's happy.
That's enough.

1009
01:58:06,625 --> 01:58:08,325
Way to go.

1010
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:16,550
This doesn't seem to be
such a bad place either, right?

1011
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,950
Lots of people here like you, Shigeo.

1012
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:24,600
Huh! That would suck.

1013
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:27,350
What's that supposed to mean, apologize!

1014
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:30,000
- Shigeo.
- Yes, what?

1015
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,350
Come and meet everybody.

1016
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:33,850
Okay.

1017
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,025
Sure was a bizarre
coincidence though.

1018
01:58:39,225 --> 01:58:40,325
Wasn't it?

1019
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:55,300
Chiyoko, could you say a word
to everyone?

1020
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:59,700
Let me introduce you to
Ms. Saeko Shiina.

1021
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:03,175
Kenji's fiancee.

1022
01:59:03,275 --> 01:59:06,325
Oh, I see. Pleasure.

1023
01:59:06,425 --> 01:59:07,975
My condolences.

1024
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:13,500
And guess what?
Saeko is pregnant.

1025
01:59:15,450 --> 01:59:18,200
We all have to wait
for Kenji's return.

1026
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:19,775
You okay with that?

1027
01:59:19,875 --> 01:59:24,125
Well of course she is!
She's carrying Kenji's child!

1028
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:29,100
Yusuke reborn.

1029
01:59:32,825 --> 01:59:34,150
Ma'am!

1030
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:40,000
Don't worry about me.
You have to look after yourself.

1031
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:43,100
Go speak to our guests!

1032
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,950
Honestly, men will just go
and do as they please.

1033
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:54,150
But it doesn't bother me.

1034
01:59:54,775 --> 01:59:56,950
We have our children.

1035
01:59:58,150 --> 01:59:59,950
Right, Saeko?

1036
02:00:03,225 --> 02:00:09,700
Well if Kozue is happy here,
then who are we to argue, right?

1037
02:00:10,625 --> 02:00:12,600
Don't look at me.

1038
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:16,700
- Idiot.
- Forgive me, Shigeo.

1039
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:22,350
No need to apologize.
This is a nice place.

1040
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:32,500
Looks pretty tough, though.

1041
02:00:33,225 --> 02:00:34,550
Behave yourself, man!

1042
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:38,350
Please don't mind us.

1043
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:40,800
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1044
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:44,600
You're getting it later, man.

1045
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,650
Ms. Saeko?

1046
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:57,800
- Yes?
- A word if I may?

1047
02:00:58,450 --> 02:00:59,500
Okay.

1048
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:19,425
- Ms. Saeko...
- Yes?

1049
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,150
I'm so glad you came today.

1050
02:01:24,625 --> 02:01:29,925
The fault for all of this
lies with us, the parents.

1051
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:35,200
Kenji's not all to blame.

1052
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:42,275
Chiyoko could really use your help.

1053
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,900
Please come again.

1054
02:01:47,075 --> 02:01:48,175
Certainly.

1055
02:02:06,715 --> 02:02:09,050
Here Kyu-chan. Let's go.

1056
02:02:31,375 --> 02:02:32,725
Morning.

1057
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:37,150
Oh, did you sleep well?

1058
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,500
Very well, thank you.

1059
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:43,875
What's your relation to Kozue again?

1060
02:02:43,975 --> 02:02:48,375
I'm her cousin.
And a friend of Kenji's, too.

1061
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:51,775
What a small world, huh?

1062
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:56,800
The last time I saw Kenji...

1063
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:00,100
he was with Yuri and her brother.

1064
02:03:00,275 --> 02:03:02,500
Yes, I heard about it.

1065
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:04,225
You did?

1066
02:03:04,325 --> 02:03:05,375
Yes.

1067
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:12,350
But that whole experience
was a real eye-opener for me.

1068
02:03:13,325 --> 02:03:18,550
I mean, until then I wasn't sure
if I was dead or alive.

1069
02:03:19,525 --> 02:03:22,325
That's why I had hoped
to see Kenji again.

1070
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,225
See him for what?

1071
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:28,700
I really don't know.

1072
02:04:05,150 --> 02:04:07,950
I thought I had quit a long time ago.

1073
02:04:12,075 --> 02:04:17,250
Know what my wife said
as she was leaving today?

1074
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:24,400
"We can't dwell on who has died
and who's still alive."

1075
02:04:24,575 --> 02:04:30,800
"Let's instead focus on who
is about to be born."

1076
02:04:37,775 --> 02:04:41,550
I don't think that Kenji can bear that.

1077
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,600
What exactly do you mean by that?

1078
02:04:52,125 --> 02:04:55,975
Kenji thought that he had finally
severed his ties to her.

1079
02:04:56,325 --> 02:04:58,725
Only she forgives him.

1080
02:04:59,425 --> 02:05:02,975
I don't think he had figured on
the depth of her mercy.

1081
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:07,000
Must've horrified him.

1082
02:05:12,275 --> 02:05:14,425
Can you live with that?

1083
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:15,875
What?

1084
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:20,775
You devote your life to
helping those in trouble...

1085
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:23,625
and they turn on you like this.

1086
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:30,550
- Can you welcome Kenji back?
- Sure.

1087
02:05:31,025 --> 02:05:33,475
It was fated to be this way.

1088
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:39,800
If he serves out his sentence,
then yes, we'll welcome him back.

1089
02:05:46,925 --> 02:05:48,525
Do your best, sir.

1090
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,025
Huh?

1091
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:54,400
I've always hated that phrase but...

1092
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:58,775
I really wish you all the best.

1093
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:07,250
Finally, I get to see you.

1094
02:06:11,775 --> 02:06:14,975
What can you see from your cell?

1095
02:06:18,975 --> 02:06:20,325
A wall.

1096
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:24,350
Of course.

1097
02:06:26,025 --> 02:06:29,050
I've been staring at one, too.

1098
02:06:32,575 --> 02:06:34,650
I met with Saeko.

1099
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:37,850
She's a good woman.

1100
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:43,950
Leave her alone.

1101
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:46,600
Don't be that way.

1102
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:50,850
We need her to give birth
to a beautiful baby.

1103
02:06:52,150 --> 02:06:56,375
By the time you're out,
the child will be in grade school.

1104
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,625
I'll have Saeko abort.

1105
02:07:01,075 --> 02:07:04,375
I've invited her to come and
live with us.

1106
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,675
We'll take care of her.

1107
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:13,150
And you don't mind if
we adopt Yuri, do you?

1108
02:07:17,575 --> 02:07:19,575
What are you scheming?

1109
02:07:20,275 --> 02:07:25,650
Not a thing. That's what
Mamiya told me to do.

1110
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:27,425
She needs a home.

1111
02:07:27,525 --> 02:07:31,150
Like hell she does.
Stay away from her!

1112
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:38,225
With your sister, Yuri,
Saeko and your child...

1113
02:07:39,025 --> 02:07:42,225
we'll all be waiting for you to return.

1114
02:07:45,585 --> 02:07:46,960
What?

1115
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:50,750
You never knew, did you?

1116
02:07:52,325 --> 02:07:53,625
Yuri...

1117
02:07:55,550 --> 02:08:01,100
is the daughter that your father and your
aunt Matsumura had between them.

1118
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:05,150
That's the reason I left.

1119
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,175
But of course...

1120
02:08:11,175 --> 02:08:13,250
you never got to hear about that.

1121
02:09:10,850 --> 02:09:12,700
Look, I don't care.

1122
02:09:14,325 --> 02:09:16,025
Do as you like.

1123
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:19,800
I'm not returning.

1124
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:27,450
You won't abandon them...
Yuri, Saeko, and your child.

1125
02:09:28,275 --> 02:09:33,025
They're all with me.
You'll be back.

1126
02:09:37,250 --> 02:09:42,375
You're the only child
I have left in the world.

1127
02:09:42,475 --> 02:09:45,275
You have to take over the business.

1128
02:09:45,675 --> 02:09:49,275
Serve out your sentence
and think it over.

1129
02:10:29,725 --> 02:10:31,825
What do you want?

1130
02:10:32,615 --> 02:10:34,050
We want Gotoh.

1131
02:10:34,675 --> 02:10:37,175
No one here by that name.

1132
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:40,750
He may have changed it.

1133
02:10:41,675 --> 02:10:43,200
Let us take a look.

1134
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:45,900
You want me to call the police?

1135
02:10:47,175 --> 02:10:49,075
Do as you wish.
