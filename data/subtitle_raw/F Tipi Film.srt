1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,069
In the year 1988,
the Counter-Terrorism Committee...

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,870
...of NATO resolved
for the isolation and...

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
...rehabilitation of
political prisoners.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
This resolution was reiterated
by IMF delegations...

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,031
...whenever they visited
Turkey...

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,392
The aim is to eradicate
the fight for revolution and...

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,038
...socialism from the prisons
and therefore, from the world.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,230
They are trying to defeat and
dissolve the political identity...

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,120
...of the revolutionist prisoners
by oppression.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,434
For this, the ideal solution
is a prison of cells...

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,597
After this resolution,
governments attempted for...

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,515
...many a time to
implement a cell system.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,114
The most comprehensive and
strategic of these attempts...

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,591
...is the implementation of
F-Type Prisons.

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,635
This film is dedicated to
122 revolutionists who passed away...

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,277
...in their struggle
against the Isolation.

17
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,994
What's going on here?

18
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,950
Calm down. You are in a cell.
You were in death fast (hunger strike).

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,034
They intervened.
You do not remember anything.

20
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Every time you sleep, all day's
experience vanishes from your memory.

21
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,600
Breakfast is coming.
That's why you woke up.

22
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,000
Give me your plate. Guards will
come for counting procedure soon.

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Breakfast! Pass your plate.

24
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,439
Calm down. Pass your plate.

25
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,475
Guards will come for counting
procedure soon. Remaing stood.

26
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,560
Put the note in your pocket,
hide it.

27
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,200
Ladies, counting!

28
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,791
Calm down. You are in a cell.
You were in death fast.

29
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,170
They intervened.
You do not remember anything.

30
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,275
Every time you sleep, all day's
experience vanishes from your memory.

31
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,199
Breakfast is coming.
That's why you woke up.

32
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,040
Pass your plate. Guards will
come for counting procedure soon.

33
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,117
Remaing stood. Put the note
in your pocket, hide it.

34
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,037
Counting time!

35
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,274
Good morning Çigdem.

36
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,630
Calm down. You are in a cell.
You were in death fast.

37
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,320
Every time you sleep, all day's
experience vanishes from your memory.

38
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,036
Breakfast is coming. Guards will
come for counting procedure soon.

39
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,800
Remain stood! This is important!
Ayse is staying in the adjacent cell.

40
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
You know her since a long time ago,
but you do not remember.

41
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,636
Her name is Ayse.
With black hairs.

42
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,519
She tells everything to you.

43
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,518
Good morning Çigdem!

44
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,554
Yes. How is it going?

45
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,115
Can you remember anything today?
Anyway, ok.

46
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,239
I will explain to you all over again.
My friend Çigdem, we are in prison...

47
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,830
...since five years. One year ago,
we started death fast for protesting...

48
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,275
...F Type Prisons.

49
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,410
They brought us here
with an operation on December 19.

50
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,630
Previously, we used to be
in Bayrampasa.

51
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,915
You started death fast 8 months ago,
but five months ago...

52
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,840
...they made a medical intervention.
Because it was a forced intervention...

53
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,675
...you do not remember the last 4 years.

54
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,191
You forget everything you did
in daytime when you sleep at night.

55
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,631
That's why I'm telling you
every morning...

56
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,474
Here is some tea.

57
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,471
You remember anything Çigdem?

58
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,760
If we are not in Bayrampasa.
Then where are we?

59
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,999
You remember me?

60
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,434
My friends.

61
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,030
Who died?

62
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,671
It has been a year since
we came here from Bayrampasa.

63
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,316
Here things are somehow different.
There are certain rules.

64
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,540
Do you remember that? Look, we are
finding a way tocommunicate with each other.

65
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,036
Look, if you remember anything
of what I've told you...

66
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,674
...please tell it to me, OK?

67
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,830
Bookshelves are forbidden.
Writing on the walls, forbidden.

68
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,792
Computers, typewriters, cassette
players, all kinds of color pens...

69
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,515
...fountain pens, ink...
all prohibited.

70
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,913
Look here it writes: C10.
They sent this from that cell.

71
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,555
And we will send it back to C10.
Here is A3. Okay, don't forget.

72
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,792
Here is A3. We're staying in A3.

73
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,516
To sing songs, folk songs,
hitting on doors... all forbidden.

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
One thing more, go and write
down all these on your notebook.

75
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,638
You have a notebook inside.
Every day you jow down things in it.

76
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,151
If a ball comes,
you must inform me.

77
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,272
It is also written on your notebook.
There are diagrams also.

78
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,995
When you get it, you'll take it,
look at the diagram, and...

79
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,998
...then throw it. Got it?

80
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,599
Zeynep. Where is Zeynep?

81
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,350
Calm down. You are in...
You are in a cell.

82
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,115
You do not remember anything.
Guards will come for counting...

83
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,755
Never let them see the note.
Ayse stays in the adjacent cell

84
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,510
Gib diese Notiz in deine
Hosentasche. Sie dürfen diese Notiz...

85
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,080
Ayse, no Ayse. No Ayse.

86
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,639
My dear friend Çigdem!
Hello! I'm Zeynep.

87
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,400
They separated us during the operation.
Ayse is no longer with you.

88
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,156
She is punished,
she is in a cell confinement.

89
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,437
She'll come soon. I'm fine.

90
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,556
I'm fine. Resistance is holding.

91
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,917
They carried out a forced medical
intervention on you.

92
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,836
Don't be sad, you did everything
you could.

93
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,233
Now your only purpose is
to get better. Only thing I saved...

94
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,360
...from Bayrampasa operation
is this music box. Do you remember?

95
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,032
You used to play it all the night
and drive us mad.

96
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,032
Don't worry, write everything.
We'll see each other soon.

97
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,675
If you get the message throw
the ball back.

98
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm at D5. Don't forget!
Write it down! Zeynep.

99
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,314
Get it! Get it!

100
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,119
Hey! Hey! It is forbidden to
throw balls from the yard.

101
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,749
Why, are you going to blast it?

102
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,999
Give it to me.

103
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,469
Come on, take it, take it.

104
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,354
Damn it, enough, give it.

105
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,837
Here.

106
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,755
Hey man, Vahap,
do not make fun of Ramazan...

107
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,712
...you will give us a headache.

108
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,590
Ramazan, what happened?

109
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,040
I got the ball, chief.

110
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,597
They didn't see the flower, right?

111
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,350
Well done man!

112
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,671
Don't! Fuck...

113
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,314
Fuck...

114
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,555
What's up, Ramazan?

115
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,755
Well chief, how are you?

116
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,032
I'm fine, thank you.
Stop calling me as chief.

117
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,953
Why do you say that?

118
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,189
What can I do,
you look like a chief.

119
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,276
Oh my God.

120
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,797
They are throwing balls
from one yard to another.

121
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,312
Give them a break, they are
communicating with each other.

122
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,839
It will be bad for that guy.

123
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,472
He will be banned from the yard.

124
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,873
Two more people are coming
tomorrow, you will be taken to...

125
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,792
...the three-person ward
together with them.

126
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,752
Finally you are free
from loneliness.

127
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,115
Two more? Three-person ward huh?

128
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,195
Aren't you glad?

129
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,918
No, it's not that. I'm trying to
finish this book.

130
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,838
Anyway, things happen.

131
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,359
Goodbye chief.

132
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,874
Wow is it 5 now?

133
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,591
Yes, it is.

134
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,278
Could you please take it.
Let me remove these.

135
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,070
They, the others...
They want a ward.

136
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,592
They are carrying out actions,
writing petitions.

137
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,197
You're so alone...

138
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,472
You are alone.

139
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,473
I'm not. Thanks to my friends
who write me letters.

140
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,200
I am fine if my doors stay
open during the daytime and...

141
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,394
...if I can go out to the yard with
my friends who are not banned...

142
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,113
...from the yard.

143
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,749
What else can a man do if he
cannot do these? He will take action.

144
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,193
Ramazan are you married?

145
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,240
I could not. Fortune.

146
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,950
Fortune.

147
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,796
Fortune.

148
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,873
Are you single, Chef?

149
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,470
Didn't I tell you not
to call me chief?

150
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm married.

151
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,434
They are not allowed visits for
unmarried guards.

152
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,195
It's hard to write a book. Hard.

153
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,592
Did you write me as well? s

154
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,273
Would you like that? s

155
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,714
It's very bad to be lonely, Chief.

156
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,429
Right.

157
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,673
Guardians are in the prison as well, Chief.

158
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,677
Write me too.

159
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,430
Ramazan, manager is coming.
Close it up.

160
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,198
Thanks Chief.

161
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,240
Ma chérie, Ma Ayse,

162
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,594
Today, I'm in the same cell with
new arriving comrades.

163
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,239
I'm getting my flower in front of the
window, ready for the obsticles.

164
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,673
It's a yellow flower.
You'd like it.

165
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,552
Whenever I look at this flower...

166
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,471
...I feel a leaking paing in my soul,
like a bad feeling during a beautiful dream.

167
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,713
This flower seems to remember his friends
in the forrest with a little fear.

168
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,998
It must be forgotton.
It wants to be remembered.

169
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,000
Prison gave it a new meaning,
new feature.

170
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,990
It looks like the prisoners.
Because the prison...

171
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,434
...never leaves anyone entered the same.

172
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,273
Whenever I look at this flower, I understand
what they have done to me.

173
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,353
In here, it is like they are casting
your soul into the mould of the walls.

174
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,953
The mould of the silence,
the mould of humanlessness.

175
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,236
There's no movement that you can
observe from somebody else...

176
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,033
...and repeat with pleasure.

177
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,312
Every movement you do is
something that you don't want to.

178
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,234
Here, loneliness is waiting for you,
before you come here my darling.

179
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,399
I have spent a lot of time in prisons,
but I have never seen...

180
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,433
...any place so frigthening.

181
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,557
To be known diminishes the feeling
of loneliness, but not the loneliness.

182
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,510
One could still be afraid from here,
even if he were a prison guard.

183
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,630
But my biggest fear is
not to be in prison...

184
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,880
...it is to not to be known
while I am inside.

185
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,558
Please director... Get ready!

186
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,755
Attention!
Mr. Director is inspecting!

187
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
Mr. Director, there are
four wards in this corridor.

188
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,275
Who is in here?

189
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,838
He is political, death fasting.

190
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,110
Death fasting?

191
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,833
How is his health, doctor?

192
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,675
Mr. Director, the prisoners
has entered the critical phase...

193
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,712
...but our eyes are on him.

194
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,840
- We have to pay attention to that.
- Yes sir, of course.

195
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,839
Everything is okay, ordered,
regular. Who is in?

196
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,754
A political journalist.
Propagating terrorism.

197
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,714
This journalist, activist.

198
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,876
We are now beyond
the European standards...

199
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
...everything is fine, our food is
great, but look what do...

200
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,870
...we have to deal with.
Am I right Mr. Doctor?

201
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,514
Unfortunately sir.

202
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,034
Who is in there?

203
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,992
Not a political,
but an ordinary criminal.

204
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,580
Is he comfortable?

205
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,797
He is certainly comfortable,
that is why he is called...

206
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,036
...Detergent Orhan.

207
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,159
Detergent Orhan?

208
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,836
Detergent Orhan. He is extremely
hygienic and he was complaining...

209
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,554
...because of the dirt
in the former prison.

210
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,479
- Very well, let's visit him.
- Open!

211
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,713
Orhan! Come Orhan come.

212
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,910
Hello Orhan!

213
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,996
Hello.

214
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,360
Detergent Orhan. How are you?

215
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,313
Fine, I am surviving.

216
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,440
Are you OK?

217
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,150
Not bad.

218
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,870
Is there anything that
you want from us?

219
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,117
Thanks.

220
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,559
Can you see Mr. Doctor?
He is comfortable, clean, neat, tidy.

221
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,432
Meet all his demands.

222
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,391
Of course sir.

223
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,035
Please pay a particular attention
to disinfect against the bugs...

224
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,360
...painting, and against all
kinds of possible problems.

225
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,680
Allah Beschütze Orhan. Sie sehen
es, nicht wahr Herr Doktor.

226
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,832
May god save you Orhan.

227
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,477
Attention! Ball is coming!

228
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,320
I got it.

229
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,672
Stand up, up! Stand up!
Yard time is up. Are you mad!

230
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,316
Go in there, go, go! Come on!

231
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,593
Yard.

232
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,159
Ball for the C10!

233
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,475
It didn't come!

234
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,479
Yard is okay!

235
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,877
Okay bro, okay I'm in.

236
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,430
Well done, you are learning.

237
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,029
Hey! Hey hey! There is
no room for you here.

238
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Okay, calm down.
You are disgusting!

239
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,111
Do you have any other friends
man? Or are you alone?

240
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,792
I see, you are going to the C10!
Are you alone?

241
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,837
Alone? Any news for C10?

242
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,117
Bow your head, now
you are a prisoner like me.

243
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:18,198
Do you need fresh air?
I can take you to the yard.

244
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,797
But promise me that you
will not escape. All right?

245
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,437
Okay I have your word.
It is few, but don't escape...

246
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,511
...I am opening. Don't escape!

247
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,432
No escape.

248
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,036
Well done.

249
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,913
You are a good
guy, huh? Hey hey hey!

250
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,111
Stop, don't escape
where are you going?

251
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,032
Are you there? Where did you
go, god damn where are you?

252
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,680
You are mine now.
Come on. You promised me.

253
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Come now, be quiet and sleep.

254
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,275
Come on now. Come on.
Come on, don't be obstinate.

255
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,598
Come on now.

256
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,350
Well done, no escaping.

257
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,234
Come here.

258
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,071
Come on. Well done,
you are learning.

259
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,760
Come on, don't escape.

260
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,030
Yard!

261
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,675
Let's see what is
Mr. Detergent doing?

262
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,675
Come, come. Have a
look, what is he doing?

263
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,475
What is he doing man?

264
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,670
Playing with the bugs.
He is totally gone mad.

265
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,038
I bet he will be worse.

266
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Take this, take it. Eat it,
what happened, didn't you like it?

267
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,277
What happened, didn't you like it?

268
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,560
Detergent! We came to disinfect!

269
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,000
What disinfection! Man,
I don't want any disinfection.

270
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,315
I said I don't want disinfection.

271
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,556
Come here!

272
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,956
I don't want disinfection!
Don't! Don't!

273
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,834
- Shut up.
- I don't want.

274
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,117
Don't spray it over the table,
I am eating there.

275
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,550
Keep your mouse shut, come here.

276
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,879
He was friends with a bug,
how do you become a friend...

277
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,279
...with a bug man!

278
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,919
Why are you doing this?

279
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,394
Yard!

280
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,310
Ball for C10!

281
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,840
We got it.

282
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,313
Yard!

283
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,473
Go! Suicide in C4! Go on!

284
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,077
It has nothing to do with us.

285
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,874
They are already depressive
and suicidal.

286
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,673
You are right sir.

287
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,879
A new day was born, We woke up
and Charged upon the trenches

288
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We were soaked in blood
For the sake of independence.

289
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,711
Come sisters and brothers,
Ours is the way to revolution

290
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,392
Come sisters and brothers,
Ours is the way to revolution

291
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,320
Our country is full of fascists,
Strike brothers and sisters,

292
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,754
Our country is full of fascists,
Strike brothers and sisters,

293
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,431
Take off your shoes, your shoes.

294
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,397
You too. Take off the shoes.

295
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,557
No to arbitrary search!
No to arbitrary search!

296
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,238
No to arbitrary search!
No to arbitrary search!

297
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,236
No to arbitrary search!
No to arbitrary search!

298
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,152
No to arbitrary search!
No to arbitrary search!

299
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,757
Guard! We have an
injured person here guard.

300
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,917
Guard! We have an injured
comrade.

301
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,237
Guard! We have an injured
comrade.

302
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,759
Munir Eröz, you have a package.

303
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,275
The human dignity
will beat torture!

304
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,071
The human dignity
will beat torture!

305
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,230
The human dignity
will beat torture!

306
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,755
The human dignity
will beat torture!

307
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,190
The human dignity
will beat torture!

308
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:47,358
The human dignity
will beat torture!

309
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,397
Why didn't you tidy up here?

310
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,600
- There's no rush.
- I'll teach you where there's rush...

311
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,871
- Shall I help you?
- Why?

312
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,194
- If you want to tidy up...
- Ah, no, thanks!

313
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,877
Ah! My shoulder...

314
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,719
Shall I throw it?

315
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,235
Can you?

316
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,430
It's not the first time I'll throw.

317
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,430
Thanks.

318
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,430
In any case, they will
mess up everything again.

319
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,517
Where they will mess up?

320
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,429
The room. Won't they make
a search again? They will.

321
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,952
What about if we don't
clean it up, from pure spite?

322
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,630
What about if we don't
clean it up, from pure spite?

323
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,800
How? All right.
We can do they too.

324
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,238
It is a sort of resistance as well,
but we should do it together...

325
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,477
...you get it?
You can suggest this.

326
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,392
They won't accept it, I think.

327
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,030
Maybe not. At the end of
the day, it is something...

328
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,670
...demoralizing.
Like a hoarder's house.

329
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,720
- Have you ever lived
in a hoarder's house? -No.

330
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,438
I had. It's not so bad.
Better than a neat and tidy cell.

331
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,672
That's right. But we are in a cell,
and this is reality.

332
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,370
Why do you think they are
making so much searches.

333
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,740
For the are pure assholes.

334
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,393
For annihilating us.

335
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,280
For making our will collapse
and drive us into submission.

336
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,159
They are trying everything
for breaking only one of us away from us.

337
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,432
To collapse one person means
to pluck out a strand of our hair.

338
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,400
Good morning.

339
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,150
Good morning.

340
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,797
Sirma, you know what.

341
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,913
Let's take you to the ward
of independent prisoners, huh?

342
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,180
No need to file a petition or like.
I'll speak it with the manager.

343
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,940
And you're an artist, you'll be
more comfortable there.

344
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,790
Your disciplinary penalties will also
be deleted, what do you say, huh?

345
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,197
Think about it.

346
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,514
Let me think about it.

347
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,519
This is for you.

348
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,672
Won't you come out today?

349
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,553
I've things to do.

350
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,071
Okay.

351
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,276
Hi Sirma! How are you?

352
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,600
You know. Isolation is a tool for
making you alone, to put you...

353
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,514
...inside the prison of your soul.
And we are trying to break it up...

354
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,395
...pull it to peaces. And you, with
your all strength and dynamics...

355
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,153
should smash the wall of solitude.

356
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,080
Good morning.

357
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,590
Good morning.

358
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,518
It is April 27th today.

359
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,757
Only three days later,
it is May the 1st

360
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,520
Really it is, so few days before...

361
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,080
- What does this mean?
- It means we are so near to it.

362
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,674
Sirma is experiencing
the effects of isolation intensively.

363
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,833
However, she is one of our friends
having strong revolutionary dynamics.

364
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,517
Always be with her and
never leave her alone.

365
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,315
We, from all prisons,
will write letters to her.

366
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,400
We will raise Sirma and all friends
similar to her...

367
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,514
...by means of our resistance.
Best!

368
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,710
Come on Sirma!

369
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,030
- Name, surname?
- Hayriye Ersoy.

370
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,671
- For whom you are here?
- Hasan Ersoy.

371
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,515
- What is your degree of relationship?
- I'm his mother.

372
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,632
What is the number of his cell?

373
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,951
C-8

374
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,754
Okay, now go in.

375
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,873
Take off that thing.

376
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,950
Shake.

377
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,431
Yes. Go on...

378
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,715
Shake.

379
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,435
Come on, go ahead. Take off.

380
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,440
Quick, go go.

381
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,312
Shake. Shake it well, let me see.

382
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,314
Show me. All right.

383
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,917
Come on woman, go on.

384
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,076
Don't you want to see your son
woman?

385
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,272
Come on! Remove your clothes...

386
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,514
Remove!

387
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,439
Okay, put them on. We won't
make it. Come on, wear.

388
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,352
Get out.

389
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,878
Get out.

390
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,193
Woman don't you get it, get out.

391
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,790
I'm gonna kick you out
if you don't remove your clothes.

392
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,240
Get out, get out.

393
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,837
Go on. That's it...

394
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,353
Let me see. Show me.

395
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,275
All right.

396
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,080
Remove the undershirt.

397
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,716
Come on, woman,
take off the undershirt.

398
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,513
Come on!

399
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,350
Remove it!

400
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,610
I'm gonna kick you out now...
Come on!

401
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,679
C'mon.

402
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,113
Get out. Get out. Go...

403
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:25,360
Come on... Remove
your undershirt woman!

404
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,434
Okay, okay.

405
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,234
Go on...

406
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:20,831
Shake it so that I can see.
All right.

407
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:29,035
Unhook the bra.
Remove the straplets, come on.

408
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,197
Take off. Unhook it.

409
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,593
Remove the straplets...

410
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:19,080
Even the sun is forbidden.
But inside I am yellow and warm.

411
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
The ember of my love
Is powerful enough to pierce the walls.

412
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:39,680
Güleycan, güleycan...

413
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,392
Güleycan, Güleycan.

414
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,759
You have guests, Muharrem.
Here you are sir.

415
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,553
- Hello.
- Hello.

416
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,434
What's up, Muharrem?

417
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,792
Were you escaping off the chair?

418
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,517
Nope, I am not Mr Director,
but the sun was trying to sneak in...

419
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,130
...so I thought I should catch and
hand it over to the management.

420
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,839
Hello, Mr Muharrem, hello.

421
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,274
We are coming from
the human rights commission.

422
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,669
If you allow us in Mr director,
can we speak in private?

423
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,271
Of course, sir. I will be in
my room if you need anything.

424
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,756
- Thank you.
- We are leaving.

425
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,870
Don't worry, whatever we talk
will remain confidential.

426
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,275
You can relax.

427
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,235
I feel even more uncomfortable now,
because I was hoping that...

428
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,558
...you would get out and
tell a few people about the isolation.

429
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,873
You are very funny Mr Muharrem.
We are already here to investigate...

430
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,233
...the isolation and
the bad treatment claims.

431
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:05,720
Are you? Well, what did you find out
about these isolation and...

432
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,439
...bad treatment claims?

433
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,075
Well it is not that there aren't
any problems, of course there are.

434
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,157
Now we are writing them
down one by one.

435
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,112
If you have a complaint,
please tell.

436
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,118
What complaint are you talking about?

437
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,231
Why do you think
I am on a death-fast.

438
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,876
I understand you very well
Mr Muharrem.

439
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,232
So what you are saying is
that, these rooms are too small.

440
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,635
Cells.

441
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,033
Whatever it is, a room or a cell.

442
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,550
You are saying there are bad treatments
from time to time.

443
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,034
Tortures.

444
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,900
I mean that you are saying
they happen quite often.

445
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,555
You are also saying that you can't
communicate and you stay alone.

446
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,797
We are saying that
we are being isolated.

447
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,278
Well, do you think these are
worth killing yoursef?

448
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,950
So you are thinking that
I am trying to kill myself.

449
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,719
Well, hunger is a way of kil...

450
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,832
You are wrong. You are wrong.

451
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,876
I am not trying to kill myself,
I am striving for the liberation of people...

452
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,149
...who are being tortured in these cells
as long as these prisons exist. That's it.

453
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,912
Well, now... with death.
That never works.

454
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,960
You need to look at it as the life is
sacred. The life you have?

455
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:46,474
Isn't it the life the god has given to you?
How can I take it away? That is a sin.

456
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,996
How old are you?

457
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,191
55. What does this have to do
with that?

458
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,793
Since you are 55, can you please
tell me why a person would die?

459
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,432
Errr, Allah bless all of us.
May Allah save us from that.

460
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,676
Well, fate would be
the most normal one.

461
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,996
I mean fate yes fate would
be the most normal one.

462
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:13,440
Besides this you can also die
for your country or for your flag.

463
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,636
Fighting for your religion...

464
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:20,518
You can die for your religion, well
cihad I mean, for the sake of martrydom.

465
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,793
For such a long list you
have lived too long...

466
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,352
here I am thinking that I am even
too late for my list with two items only.

467
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,319
Two items? What, what are they?

468
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,558
Two items; Honour and justice.

469
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,918
Pull his sleeves up, pull them up.

470
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,477
You are such a good person, you
don't torture but still you witness it.

471
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,080
Look, how amazing it is.

472
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,680
No, no, no I strongly reject this.

473
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,315
I can't even look at it,
let alone watching it happen.

474
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,510
Me, too.

475
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:14,396
Here I am standing right in front of
your face. Look, look, look at my arms.

476
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,911
They burst my veins trying to
give me a serum.

477
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,671
Look, look, can you see
the bruises here?

478
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,072
They are from the kicks I got when
they tried to put me on a strectcher.

479
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,637
Don't you think that's torture?
Isn't the isolation a torture proper?

480
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,830
No, no you are right, this is
not acceptable at all.

481
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:38,797
But think that Muharrem, well,
we have completed a report...

482
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,838
...on ward types. You need to see it,
people are jammed...

483
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,350
...packed like sardines. They don't
have anything; No hygiene...

484
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,031
...no air conditioning,
no heating, nothing.

485
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,394
Do you solve the unhealty conditions
in the wards by prisoning people in cells?

486
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,358
Well the only problem is
not that people are packed.

487
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,234
We have seen Bayrampasa prison
the other day.

488
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,560
We visited the wards of the criminals.
The mafia owns that place.

489
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,400
Well now, the criminals are
very disturbed by this.

490
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,840
If there are individual rooms, the
pressure factor automatically disappears.

491
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,994
Why did you cast us in these
cells then, you could bring mafia.

492
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,910
But you have the issue of
pressure by the organisation.

493
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:31,880
I have been here on my own
for years. Ok?

494
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:39,680
I exercise every morning, read,
write a letter. I am on death-fast.

495
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,557
Go, look under the bunk,
maybe the organisation is there.

496
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,357
Muharrem, Muharrem
someone came for you, is that right?

497
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,949
Who are they Muharrem? Who came?

498
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,310
What's that?

499
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,949
Telefon.

500
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,036
Can you use phones
in the rooms freely?

501
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,277
- It is an extension line.
- What?

502
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,900
We use this because
it is cheaper to talk that way.

503
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:12,592
Anyway I should tell them not to
bother us much during our consultation.

504
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,958
It is the committee,
the committee from the assembly!

505
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:24,912
Say 'hello' to the friends
for me and talk to you later.

506
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:33,080
Good, nice, very smart. Maybe,
you are not totally isolated here.

507
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,232
How can you say that?

508
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:45,472
All of these conditions mean that
there is isolation not there isn't any.

509
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,991
Haven't all these creative methods
been discovered in such...

510
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,477
...harsh circumtances
throughout the human history?

511
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:59,516
Yes, we will assess
what you have told us, Muharrem.

512
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,552
We have noted them all, right.

513
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:07,680
We are leaving now but I ask you,
please don't kill yourself, ok?

514
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,680
Pleease!

515
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:19,680
Are you still stuck in that topic?
Anyway, let me enlighten some of...

516
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:25,032
...the problems with my action and
you do focus on these problems...

517
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,153
...not on me.
- Have a good day.

518
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:41,593
Have a good day my friend.

519
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,840
The human dignity will defeat torture!

520
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,238
Open! Open!

521
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:54,560
Cover his mouth.
Come on! Can't you do it?

522
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,074
...seine Arme zu öffnen!
Los ausstrecken!

523
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,671
- Pull them up.
- Where are his vessels? Hold his wrist.

524
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:28,473
My dear comrades! They are
trying to stop me with forced intervention.

525
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:34,880
I won't allow it. When I started off,
I said that I will sing the lyrics of...

526
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:41,640
...'My generation, I am at the climax
of dying with my honour now'...

527
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,880
...by Kahraman on my last breath.
Now is the time.

528
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:51,916
I would like you to know I will sing
"My Generation" before I light the lighter.

529
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,755
We have seen enough.
We have shared enough.

530
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:03,040
The beauty of shared values lies
in the prices you pay for them.

531
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:11,800
Now is my time for me to sacrifice
and die for those beauties. Goodbye!

532
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,956
Goodbye!

533
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:19,480
Muharrem Karademir is immortal.

534
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,156
- Muharrem's mother wants to come as well.
- To have the coffin made?

535
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,312
She should better stay at home...
Our friends are with her.

536
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,312
I mean, she can't stand
staying at home.

537
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,797
Where are we going to
have the coffin made?

538
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,958
Osman will do it.

539
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:11,314
Seyfi, just take down all,
pile them up there. Properly...

540
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,399
- Where is Osman?
- He has a patient.

541
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,633
Go and bring him here,
quick. Hurry!

542
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,711
Come on, mother. Mother Sakine
you can sit here if you like.

543
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,437
Hold on, we will be arriving shortly,
okay? Let's go...

544
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,357
Isn't Master Osman here?

545
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,530
We are waiting for him as well.
He was supposed to come...

546
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,520
- Did you have an order?
- We will have...

547
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,199
Look. There is no problem about
his craftsmanship, he is great.

548
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,676
But why don't you mind your own
bussiness, just care about...

549
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,439
...your profits, am I right?

550
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:38,471
Look. He will build the same set,
that's for sure.

551
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,195
Should the owner of this brand
come, he cannot differentiate it...

552
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,797
...from the original. He is that good;
But give him the money before...

553
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,310
...he finishes the work, and
you are lucky if you can see...

554
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,272
...Master Osman's face again.

555
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,792
Just win the race for once.
I swear I will nicker like a horse.

556
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,478
Master, that man who asked
for a dining table came.

557
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,315
Just grab some sweets and
pastries from the pastry shop...

558
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,790
...hurry. Run, man, run!
Hey! He came with whom?

559
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,076
- With his wife or alone?
- His wife wasn't here.

560
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,998
They have carried some
wood blocks with porters inside.

561
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,554
Run, man, run!

562
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,671
Look at this wood,
a meter cube of this...

563
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,599
...can buy this workshop completely.

564
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,600
Recently, he asked me
for an advance payment.

565
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,519
So he would go and buy it with
cash for himself, you see?

566
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,677
I said okay. How many meter cubes
do you need?

567
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,598
He just multiplied, divided and
said this much...

568
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,076
I asked what his other costs
are going to be.

569
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,150
I mean, altogether it is two hundred
or three hundred liras.

570
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,233
When he comes, I will say
here take this four hundred...

571
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,953
you see I have brought the lumbers.

572
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,436
And here is the advance payment.
Am I wrong?

573
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:49,636
Oh for goodness sake. Do not give him any
money before you have your work done.

574
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,913
- What kind of piece do you want?
- Coffin.

575
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,433
Welcome brother...
You are welcome... Welcome...

576
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,355
Welcome.

577
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,477
Okay, you help these friends.

578
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,650
Was it burnt? Do you need
galvanization again?

579
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,796
Yes.

580
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,112
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

581
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,152
- My condolences.
- Thank you

582
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,792
Unfortunately I don't have pine tree.

583
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,850
The worst thing is that
there is no galvanization.

584
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:14,275
Okay, then umm, let's use
linoleum instead of galvanization.

585
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,910
Can not we find any another tree?

586
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:21,159
- When do you need it?
- Tomorrow morning.

587
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,116
- Where will it go?
- To the Gazi Neighborhood.

588
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,600
No, the money is not
a problem mother.

589
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,760
Well, brother, it is not
possible to deliver it tomorrow.

590
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,110
I mean, if we think of buying
any other kind of wood...

591
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,232
...it will only arrive by tomorrow.

592
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,740
I suggest that you hire a funeral
transport vehicle, they will do the rest.

593
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,759
Okay, bye.

594
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:31,840
Who are they?

595
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,073
That's none of your business, asshole.
Are you a policeman or a prosecutor?

596
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,170
I know nothing about
the organization and anything else...

597
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,994
Damn, they have burnt the man
for not eating the food and...

598
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,715
...this asshole is worried about
his dinner table.

599
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,355
Moreover he is fake. If you are
rich enough, go and buy...

600
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,790
...a genuine table asshole...

601
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,119
Ah this money thing, you can
grease all the wheels with it.

602
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,994
Take this. Look, I wrote
the dimensions here...

603
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,319
...make the cuts accordingly and
you can leave when you are finished.

604
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,394
Take this as well,
that pimp may arrive.

605
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,356
If he comes, you can say I left
to buy some polish. All right?

606
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,360
Okay then, good luck.

607
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,713
Thanks very much.
It is very good.

608
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,080
How much do we owe?

609
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,831
This time, this is from us.

610
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,680
Let's unload it.

611
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:02,080
Here is a grave.
There is nobody. No sound.

612
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,599
Where am I?

613
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,830
Anybody? Anybody?

614
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:25,680
Human dignity will defeat torture!
Human dignity will defeat torture!

615
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,558
Anybody?

616
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:15,954
End to the isolation!
End to the isolation!

617
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,277
End to the isolation!

618
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,474
End to the isolation!
End to the isolation!

619
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,240
End to the isolation!

620
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:09,596
They thought that we could fit
in here, but they were wrong.

621
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:14,796
We don't fit in here,
we've started to overflow

622
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,799
We've started to flow,
just to spite the silence

623
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:21,520
The F-Type prisons opened
in December 19, 2000...

624
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,155
...with the bloodiest prison
operation in history.

625
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,700
8.335 soldiers in 8 battalions and
37 companies were...

626
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:32,474
...involved in the operation.
Chemical gas, flame throwers...

627
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,638
...hand grenades and
more than 20.000 shots of...

628
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,479
...gas bomb were used.

629
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,115
During the operation,
28 prisoners were killed...

630
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:43,278
...while hundreds of them
became permanently disabled.

631
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,674
Survivors were sent to
F-Type prisons.

632
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,150
Revolutionary prisoners
who rejected surrendering...

633
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,920
...to the F-Type and
the isolation resisted...

634
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,157
...with the death fasting campaign.
7 years, which makes 25 seasons...

635
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:56,397
...or 79 months or 2280 days,
passed in hunger.

636
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,240
Some died because of death
fasting while some were...

637
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,875
...massacred in the operations.
With the interventions in death...

638
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,435
...fasting by force,
some were disabled.

639
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,995
Still resisting against these,
some of the other Death...

640
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:08,998
...Fasting Resistance Fighters
had to burn themselves.

641
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,476
Today, the resistance against
the F-Type prisons and...

642
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,500
...Isolation is being sustained
in and outside the prisons.
