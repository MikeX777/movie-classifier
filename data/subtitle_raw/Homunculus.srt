00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:10,833
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,750
Good morning.

3
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,125
You'd better lower the heat.

4
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,083
Thanks.

5
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,250
That smells good. 

6
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,458
Are you celebrating something?

7
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,500
You idiot. We're having a wake.

8
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,375
-Huh?
-A wake.

9
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,125
We hadn't seen Ken around for a while,

10
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,291
so I went to check his tent,
but he was already cold.

11
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,416
An-chan, he taught you lots of things
when you first got here too, right?

12
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,833
Yeah.

13
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,833
So where's Ken now?

14
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,083
They removed him already.

15
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,500
You should have said,
"They took him away."

16
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,291
He's not an object, you know.

17
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,750
Here. You can have this.

18
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,208
-Sake for mourning!
-See ya.

19
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,666
An-chan, how about a drink?

20
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,541
Hey! Don't waste your time.

21
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,291
His friend just died,

22
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,500
but he doesn't feel anything?

23
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,958
He's been living over there
for a long time.

24
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,291
It seems he can't remember anything.

25
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,041
Is it amnesia?

26
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:39,958
Who knows?

27
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,750
He seems to be doing fine,
but there's something fishy.

28
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,250
Can you smell that?

29
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,083
Thank you. 

30
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,791
Could you please sign here?

31
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,916
SUSUMU NAKOSHI

32
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,416
Please open the door.

33
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,125
I'm not a weirdo or anything.

34
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,250
Who are you?

35
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,750
It's cold out here. Could you let me in?

36
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,416
I don't give rides to strangers.

37
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,875
You're homeless, aren't you?

38
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,666
You don't have a home or a job.

39
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,791
Sorry. If I've insulted you, I apologize.

40
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,625
To get down straight to business,

41
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,125
I have a certain job
that I'd like you to take.

42
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,500
How does 700,000 yen sound?

43
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,083
Sorry, but I've already got money.

44
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,583
Hey.

45
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,625
Hey. What are you doing?

46
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,125
It's a simple human research experiment.

47
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,708
It's called "trepanation."

48
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,833
Right here,
I'll drill a tiny hole in your skull.

49
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,708
Leave.

50
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,333
No, I know the thought of
boring a hole in your skull is scary,

51
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,625
but it's really no big deal at all.

52
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,416
-Just leave.
-Frankly,

53
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,750
it's just like teeth.

54
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,000
It's just a little hole.
Your brain won't be harmed.

55
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,208
That's all.

56
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,750
You've heard it before, right?

57
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,916
Humans only use 10% of their brains. 

58
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,958
If we could leverage the other 90%,
what would happen?

59
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,208
An intuition sharper than anyone else's
could be unleashed,

60
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,875
or a sixth sense could awaken,

61
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,333
or memories could return.

62
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,083
Then put a hole in your own skull.

63
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,250
You can just try it on yourself.

64
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,250
I mean, it's just a tiny hole here, right?

65
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,208
No way.

66
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,750
It sounds scary!

67
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,791
Get lost. Find someone else.
Plenty of other people need money.

68
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,166
It has to be you! 

69
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,166
This park is where homeless people gather,

70
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:07,291
and that luxury hotel
is where ordinary people go.

71
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:12,541
I want you, the one who's smack-dab
in the middle of both!

72
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:20,583
Listen, I'm just taking time off work
to see what it's like to be homeless.

73
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,208
Well, you could say…

74
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,791
I'm trying to "find myself."

75
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,708
Get someone else.

76
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,583
Whenever you lie,
the left side of your mouth goes up.

77
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,375
You can't cry, can you?

78
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,500
You can't even feel sad.

79
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,958
You're desperately
trying to feel something.

80
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:53,875
Right?

81
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,791
I'm right, aren't I?

82
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,791
You must be bored.

83
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,875
No, that's not it.

84
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,916
Most people would get angry
if someone said that to them.

85
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,875
Nakoshi.

86
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,666
Do you ever feel alive?

87
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,208
You…

88
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,958
How did you know my name?

89
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,625
You don't remember… do you?

90
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,416
I'll be back.

91
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,958
Hey! This is bad! 

92
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,291
Hey!

93
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,833
An-chan with the car! 

94
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,750
Hey!

95
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,416
An-chan with the car! 

96
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,958
-An-chan!
-What happened?

97
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,083
Your car!

98
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,041
Quickly!

99
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,250
DAY ONE

100
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,208
They got you, huh?

101
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,333
SHINJUKU TOWING

102
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,750
They just had to go
and take your car, didn't they?

103
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,041
You had your clothes and your stuff
in your car, right?

104
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:40,333
The tow truck
is going to cost a lot of money.

105
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,708
But An-chan,
you've got lots of money, right?

106
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,625
Hey. You've got money, right?

107
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,666
Hey. Are you okay?

108
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,500
I've never seen him look like that before.

109
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,875
The only place
you could return to is gone.

110
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,458
Are you going to stay here forever?

111
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,583
So it was you…

112
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,083
What are you living for?

113
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,750
How should I know?

114
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,708
You finally look annoyed.

115
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,666
Seven days.

116
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,666
I'll give you a reason to live.

117
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,083
What a creepy room.

118
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:10,500
Trepanation is a surgical procedure that
has been done since the Neolithic Period.

119
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,416
Nowadays, a group called ITAG
in the Netherlands works to promote it.

120
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,208
There are even people
who put a hole in their own head.

121
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,000
What a sicko.

122
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,833
So, who are you?

123
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,791
I'm Manabu Ito. I'm a medical intern.

124
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,041
My father runs this hospital.
That makes me the boss's kid.

125
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,666
The boss's kid? 

126
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,791
What if your parents found out about this?

127
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,541
I just want to learn about humans.

128
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,791
Can I ask you a question?

129
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,666
Yeah.

130
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,666
How much do you remember about yourself?

131
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,416
Who knows?

132
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,083
You're not interested in yourself?

133
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,000
It doesn't matter anymore. 

134
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,583
I'm right in the middle of Shinjuku,
but no one's looking for me.

135
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,791
What worth is the life of a man like that?

136
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:14,666
"A man like that."
That's exactly why I'm interested in you.

137
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,500
When humans are born,
they have a gap in their skull,

138
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,875
meaning there is a hollow space.

139
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,875
But after a year and a half,
that hole closes up,

140
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,958
and the skull
starts pushing on the brain.

141
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:39,166
Therefore, if we open a hole in the skull
and improve the blood circulation,

142
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,791
it would activate the brain again,
just like how it was at birth.

143
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,083
It would draw out abilities
that hadn't been used before.

144
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,625
That's the simple principle
behind trepanation.

145
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,375
Don't worry. 

146
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,750
Honestly, I'm better
than most doctors around here.

147
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, please make sure you don't move
while I'm drilling the hole.

148
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,833
It'd be bad if your meninges tear.

149
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,291
If that happens, then whatever.

150
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,041
Even if I become a vegetable,

151
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,750
it wouldn't be any different
from how things are now.

152
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,791
Is the anesthetic working?

153
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,541
Yeah.

154
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:12,916
Ouch…

155
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:59,333
LET'S HAVE DINNER TOGETHER
ITO

156
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:08,250
DAY TWO

157
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:12,250
The experiment will last for seven days.
I'll pay you 300,000 yen in advance.

158
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,416
You'll get the rest once it's over.

159
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,625
I told you I've got money already.

160
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,041
So? What are you trying to do?

161
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,166
Shouldn't you have asked that
before I made the hole? 

162
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,250
Here.

163
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,875
ESP experiment,

164
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,916
sixth sense check,
psychokinesis experiment…

165
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,791
What is all this?
I thought this was a medical experiment.

166
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:44,916
I'll be honest.

167
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,291
I don't believe in spirits
and supernatural powers and the occult.

168
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,541
Everything can be explained by the brain.

169
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,625
That's why I want to use this experiment
to clear all the remaining doubts I have

170
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,333
and proudly deny that it exists.

171
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:58,708
Deny what?

172
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,416
This world right in front of me.

173
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,375
Excuse me. Here's the chili shrimp.

174
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,666
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thank you.

175
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,041
Then let's get started with a simple game.

176
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,208
What?

177
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,541
I've got these cards
with these five symbols. 

178
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,375
Guess which card has the star symbol.

179
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,375
All right.

180
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,041
Nakoshi.

181
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:43,958
Huh?

182
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,750
Use your left side.

183
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,458
-That's not what I mean.
-What?

184
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,291
I want you to try feeling it
with your whole left side.

185
00:18:55,791 --> 00:19:00,166
Your senses of sight,
hearing, smell, and touch.

186
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,708
Use all of that from only the left side
of your body to envision the card.

187
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,250
All right.

188
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,291
Don't get too full of yourself.

189
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,166
Today was just practice.
We'll get to the real stuff tomorrow.

190
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,708
So what? Four cards is better than usual?

191
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,958
Oh, this is so you can contact me.
It has my number in it.

192
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,583
Okay.

193
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,916
And…

194
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,666
Hey.

195
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,875
It looks good on you.

196
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,708
I'll see you tomorrow.

197
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,875
This is an announcement
for all Kabukicho visitors.

198
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:43,083
Recently, there have been incidents
of fraudulent soliciting in Kabukicho…

199
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,083
Ouch!

200
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,166
What was that?

201
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,291
Hello? Today? 

202
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,625
Now?

203
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,625
Well, I'm in Kabukicho right now.

204
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,708
Where are you? 

205
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,583
Oh, okay. Then… 

206
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,458
What's wrong with him?

207
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,833
There's a weird guy here…

208
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,291
I understand you better than anyone.

209
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,208
Really?

210
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,958
Then let me hear it…

211
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,208
What's going on? 

212
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,791
Sorry!

213
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,291
-Hey!
-What's wrong with you? 

214
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,333
-Sorry…
-You stink. 

215
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:41,875
Hey.

216
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:43,958
Boss…

217
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,750
What are you winking at? You bastard!

218
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,500
No, I didn't mean to…

219
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,250
You...

220
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,125
No…

221
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,458
Boss, he's a civilian.
What if he goes to the police?

222
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,625
It doesn't matter.

223
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,625
Don't move.

224
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,250
How about if I cut off your pinkie…

225
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,291
No…

226
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,333
No…

227
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,708
How many am I at?

228
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,416
He's the 77th.

229
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,666
Wait.

230
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,208
You can't.

231
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,583
What are you doing?

232
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,541
That's your own finger! 

233
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,875
Don't do it! 

234
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,833
Wait! Put down
that sickle-like thing. Okay?

235
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,958
Sickle?

236
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,333
Yeah.

237
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,875
Hey, what did you do? 

238
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:24,041
No, just stop. Calm down.

239
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,000
Don't hurt yourself.

240
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,625
-Okay?
-You bastard!

241
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,166
What did you say?

242
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,333
Boss!

243
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,875
What's going on?

244
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,625
Boss!

245
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:45,750
Stay back!

246
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,916
-What's wrong?
-Boss…

247
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,125
What's the matter?

248
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,708
I said stay back!

249
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:52,875
Hey!

250
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,416
-Boss!
-What did you do?

251
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,958
Hurry up! Let's go! Come on!

252
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,791
Do you believe me?

253
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,583
Let's assume I do believe you. 

254
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,875
Don't give me that crap.

255
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,083
Wow, this is amazing!

256
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,291
I didn't tell you,

257
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,500
but studies abroad say 36%
who did trepanation felt a sixth sense.

258
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,708
It's more common
for people to feel nothing!

259
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,125
-What else didn't you tell me?
-Hey, Nakoshi…

260
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,375
What about me?

261
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,541
How do I look to you?

262
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,083
What?

263
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,875
I don't see anything.

264
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,375
Are you sure?

265
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,208
I'm sure. 

266
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,708
You said you believe me, didn't you?

267
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,416
What's wrong?

268
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:03,916
DAY THREE

269
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,208
When I saw this, it all made sense.

270
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:11,666
What's that?

271
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,541
It's a homunculus.

272
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,333
Homunculus?

273
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,291
Yes.

274
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,958
Basically, it is a man-made
human being created using alchemy. 

275
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,208
However, a neurosurgeon named Penfield

276
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,333
used the word "homunculus" to refer
to a miniature human inside the brain.

277
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:32,333
Its hands and lips are huge.

278
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,083
Since we were born, 

279
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:37,333
we've used our hands and mouths
in order to feel something.

280
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,916
Sex is a good example of that.

281
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,083
But it looks
nothing like the monsters I saw.

282
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:46,000
For example, we use the expression
"He's lacking substance," right?

283
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,958
That describes this man perfectly.

284
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,083
No. He was kind of fat…

285
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:53,458
What's key is that this is
a person's source of mental stress. 

286
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,750
That's the issue.

287
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:58,333
Well, they might lack substance,
but aren't you jumping to conclusions?

288
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,833
It's one interpretation.

289
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:03,958
I think they're the self-images that
each individual has of themselves.

290
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:10,250
After all, the homunculi you saw
were not all the same simple shape, right?

291
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,375
In other words, since we activated
your brain through the surgery,

292
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:18,958
you've gained the ability to visualize
people's deep sources of stress.

293
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,458
In other words, trauma?

294
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,250
Yes, that's it! That's right!

295
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,000
Trauma is created
from past emotions and memories.

296
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,500
That's what you're able to see.

297
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:35,125
Then why can some people see homunculi,
but others can't?

298
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,916
That's what we're going to find out.

299
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,041
We're going to create hypotheses
and verify them. Experimentation.

300
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,541
Is this really going to be over
in a week?

301
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't want to spend my whole life
seeing monsters.

302
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,000
You're no fun… 

303
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,708
You're experiencing
something amazing right now!

304
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:52,416
You can see inside people's hearts.

305
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
I'm so jealous. 

306
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:57,708
That's it.

307
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,791
Let's go out now
and test out your new ability.

308
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,708
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

309
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,416
Are there any here?

310
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,583
I'm leaving.

311
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:39,208
Rumors say this place
has real high school students.

312
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,750
It's like a modern freakshow.

313
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,875
You like monsters like her?

314
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,583
Huh?

315
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:16,875
Found one. 

316
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,416
She's a sand monster.

317
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,000
Sand?

318
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:25,916
You mean that girl?

319
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,083
I'm going to make direct contact with her.

320
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,916
Did you think of something?

321
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,500
If she's made up of dry sand,
I'll just have to make her wet.

322
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,791
You just want to fuck
a high school student.

323
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:57,750
No.

324
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,250
I want to fuck a homunculus.

325
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,500
You're disgusting.

326
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:12,625
Hello.

327
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:14,458
Are you alone? 

328
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,791
Are you studying?

329
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,500
You're shaking.

330
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,708
Are you perhaps…

331
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,041
Hey, are you okay?

332
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,916
Too bad. She ran away.

333
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,458
No, that's not what I mean.

334
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:43,875
Your face.

335
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,125
-My face?
-Yeah.

336
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:51,958
I swiped this.

337
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,666
You stole it?

338
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,666
Hold onto it.
If anything happens, report it to me.

339
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,833
Thanks.

340
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,291
You're shaking.

341
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,041
Hey…

342
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,541
What are you so scared about? 

343
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,375
Are you perhaps… 

344
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,875
a virgin?

345
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,333
MOM: Where are you?
Call me if you're running late.

346
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,875
MOM: Why aren't you picking up?

347
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,666
MOM: Don't you have to study?

348
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,666
MOM: You're not smart like Kaede.

349
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,916
MOM: Where are you?

350
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,833
MOM: Call me!

351
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:20,666
1775.YUKARI

352
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:30,041
FILL ME UP…

353
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,041
I'M SO DIRTY…

354
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,291
NOTICE ME, FIND ME…

355
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,916
JUST THE WAY I AM…

356
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,833
DIRTY FEELINGS…

357
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:40,791
HELP ME.

358
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,625
NEED ME.

359
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,541
WANT ME.

360
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,166
TOUCH ME.

361
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,583
Geez… 

362
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,416
"When I become one with you,

363
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,916
-everything becomes real."
-…everything becomes real.

364
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,500
When I become one with you,

365
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,791
I become one.

366
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,166
Soon, I want to become one.

367
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,041
That's so creepy.

368
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:27,458
Hey.

369
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,625
We've been looking for you.

370
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,333
-No, wait… 
-Come on! Hey!

371
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,416
-Wait!
-You bastard! 

372
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:44,000
Yesterday…

373
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,125
what did you do to me?

374
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,500
Well…

375
00:36:58,666 --> 00:36:59,958
I saw something.

376
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,666
You saw something? 

377
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,791
What did you see?

378
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,125
A robot.

379
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,041
A robot?

380
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,291
Does that mean anything to you?

381
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,458
Something about a pinkie and a sickle…

382
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,000
I have no idea whatsoever.

383
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:30,875
Oh.

384
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,458
Sorry.

385
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,291
Hey. What are you doing?

386
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,833
A child…

387
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,166
Sorry…

388
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,833
Don't move!

389
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:27,750
Stay back!

390
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,416
I'll cut off your pinkie!

391
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,666
There he is!

392
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,875
What are you talking about?

393
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:48,083
What a wound… 

394
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,291
Ouch!

395
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,541
Sorry!

396
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,916
That must have hurt, huh?

397
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah…

398
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,416
You bastard! Hey!

399
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,750
This will cost you
more than just a finger.

400
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,291
What is this?

401
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,500
What's this feeling?

402
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,583
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,833
When you were a kid,

404
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,083
what did you do to your pinkie
with the sickle?

405
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:41,208
Oh, wow! It's a sickle!

406
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,750
Whoa! Hey! Let me see!

407
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,291
No! I'll trade you for that.

408
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,416
Huh? No way.

409
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,875
Stop it!

410
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,666
You bastard!

411
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,708
I see…

412
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,291
Guilt.

413
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,833
You're not the one
who got hurt with the sickle.

414
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:42,250
You hurt someone else.

415
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:46,958
No!

416
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,250
-What's the big deal? 
-No!

417
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,625
-Let me see it!
-No way!

418
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,166
-No!
-Come on!

419
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,208
-No! I don't want to!
-Hey!

420
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,541
-Stop!
-Give it to me!

421
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:55,458
No!

422
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,583
Kazuo…

423
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:04,500
Kazuo!

424
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:10,791
Kazuo!

425
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,583
Kazuo!

426
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,416
No!

427
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,000
You were scared

428
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,916
and couldn't apologize. 

429
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,916
Right?

430
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:56,708
-I…
-I…

431
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,916
-did that to Kazuo's pinkie…
-did that to Kazuo's pinkie…

432
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,500
-Kazuo,
-Kazuo,

433
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,250
-I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!

434
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,916
I'm sorry…

435
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,416
-I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!

436
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:23,583
-I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!

437
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:26,708
I'm sorry!

438
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:34,333
The only thing you could do
was cover up your regret and your sin.

439
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:40,958
You deliberately hurt people… 

440
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,208
and accepted your loneliness…

441
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,208
Your guilt… 

442
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,166
turned you into a yakuza.

443
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,333
As of today, I'm quitting the yakuza.

444
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,666
Allow me to compensate for what I've done.

445
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,000
We hadn't seen Ken around for a while,

446
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:13,000
so I went to check his tent,
but he was already cold.

447
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:17,333
An-chan, he taught you lots of things
when you first got here too, right?

448
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:38,333
What is this?

449
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,625
Hey, An-chan.

450
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,083
Hey.

451
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,750
I heard you got your car back. 

452
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:50,791
Yeah.

453
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,416
Let's have a drink.

454
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:54,916
Yeah?

455
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,833
Okay.

456
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,166
I see.

457
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,041
An insurance company?

458
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,416
Yes.

459
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,375
I calculated probabilities whenever
someone wanted to buy life insurance.

460
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,041
For example,

461
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:17,458
that guy in the suit
eating a piece of bread.

462
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,125
60 million yen max.

463
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,083
That family over there, 

464
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:25,791
no more than 80 million for the father,
and for the mother, 38 million. 

465
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,958
And 48 million just for the kid.

466
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,708
That's more than 100 million.

467
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,416
Well, it's just a rough estimate,

468
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,166
but every life
has a monetary value assigned to it.

469
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,750
What a bunch of rubbish! 

470
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,166
Who decides stuff like that?

471
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,208
Ryo.

472
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,125
How old are you?

473
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:47,583
I'm 41.

474
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,875
Forty-one.

475
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:52,000
How often do you drink?

476
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,583
Wh-What you see here.

477
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,708
Every day.

478
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:56,916
Do you smoke?

479
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:58,958
No, I don't.

480
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,375
Have you ever had any major diseases?

481
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,166
No,

482
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,375
but I had appendicitis once.

483
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:10,208
Do your parents, siblings, or any of your
relatives have any hereditary disorders?

484
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,541
Well… um…

485
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,958
Oh, and what's your income every year?

486
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,291
-What? Even if you ask me…
-Well,

487
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,791
an approximation is fine.

488
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,708
That comes out to…

489
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,750
Ryo, your value is--

490
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:26,666
You idiot! 

491
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:29,375
Don't decide how much someone's worth!

492
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:33,000
Don't put a price on someone's life!

493
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:36,041
Calm down!

494
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:40,958
Calm down!

495
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,541
Hey, take it easy!

496
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,958
The moon is the moon…

497
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,291
Ouch…

498
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,416
Hello?

499
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,958
You want me to give you
your phone back, right?

500
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,916
Just tell me where to bring it.

501
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,916
Okay.

502
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,083
I'll be going now. Thanks for the food.

503
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,875
Hey, you have my phone, right?

504
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,333
Yeah.

505
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,791
Hey! Don't just get in without asking!

506
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,750
MOM: Where are you?

507
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,125
Looking out for your mother?

508
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,750
You checked my phone, didn't you?

509
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,875
Give it back to me. 

510
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,291
Gross.

511
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:59,500
You work with that pimply guy, don't you?

512
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:00,750
So what if I do?

513
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,916
Is this where you live? 

514
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:10,541
Do you work? 

515
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,583
You don't?

516
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,958
What a half-assed loser.

517
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,125
"When I become one with you,
everything becomes real."

518
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,500
You did check my phone.

519
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,666
"When I become one with you,

520
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,416
I'm freed from this world. 

521
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,666
When I become one with you,

522
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,000
I become one. 

523
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:49,875
Soon…"

524
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,250
Stop!

525
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:52,916
"I want to become one!"

526
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,708
Stop!

527
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:09,833
This… isn't sand…

528
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:19,625
They're symbols?

529
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:24,083
Pervy old man…

530
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,083
PERVY OLD MAN

531
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,000
Wh-What's all this?

532
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:32,958
Let go of me! 

533
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,708
Ouch…

534
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,166
What are you trying to do?

535
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,250
Hey!

536
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:52,541
Hey, what are you thinking?

537
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,750
What are you trying to do?

538
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:06,041
Being a virgin is embarrassing.

539
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,666
Are you crazy?

540
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:20,666
You want to fuck me, right?

541
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,583
You…

542
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:38,291
That's so gross…

543
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,416
What a half-assed loser…

544
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:44,541
You're the one who's a loser!

545
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,833
Do you understand what you're doing?

546
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:03,375
If I become one with you, 

547
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:06,291
everything becomes real…

548
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,125
Sex is your only way
of rebelling against your parents.

549
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:14,041
You're holding onto a shitty fantasy.

550
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,583
Please.

551
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,958
Be gentle with me.

552
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,375
Stop!

553
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,291
Seriously, what are you doing?

554
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,250
I am you.

555
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,166
I AM YOU

556
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,666
I'm not like you!

557
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,333
Wait a minute--

558
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,416
What's that?

559
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:00,333
Hey! Stop! 

560
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,291
Don't look!

561
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:06,041
Don't look!

562
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:09,000
Stop!

563
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:10,833
Don't look!

564
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:13,375
You're finally showing your true colors…

565
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:21,208
Stop!

566
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,958
No!

567
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,000
Spit it out! 

568
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:29,041
Give it back! It's mine!

569
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,916
It hurts! 

570
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,208
It hurts! 

571
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,375
It hurts! It's hot!

572
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,000
You became human.

573
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,000
It hurts!

574
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,166
What are you doing? It hurts!

575
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,375
MOM

576
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:23,375
What in the world are you thinking
going out so late?

577
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,208
I know.

578
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,416
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

579
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,541
I told you to talk to me about it. 

580
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:36,583
To go that far--

581
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,958
That's…

582
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,333
What are you going to do?

583
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,000
How can they do that here?

584
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,916
They didn't get a proper education.

585
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:39,166
Don't mess up my car.

586
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:44,958
What are you talking about?

587
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:49,041
It's so pretty.

588
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:12,958
DAY FOUR

589
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,375
Not again…

590
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:24,833
Hey…

591
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:33,708
Hey!

592
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,166
Bring me Ito!

593
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:38,625
I said get the medical intern Ito
out here right now!

594
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:40,458
Excuse me. Can I have your name?

595
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:43,958
I'm his patient.

596
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,875
Please wait over there.

597
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,125
Empty.

598
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,250
What?

599
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:50,833
Are you okay?

600
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:52,583
Yeah, I'm okay. 

601
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:55,041
Sorry.

602
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,625
Nakoshi.

603
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:29,416
Don't come without contacting first.

604
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,708
-Tell me what's going on!
-Calm down. 

605
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:33,875
Something happened, huh?

606
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:45,791
I thought you didn't
give strangers rides.

607
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,166
You're not a stranger anymore.

608
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:59,333
Homunculi are warped elements
locked up in the back of the subconscious.

609
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:01,416
That's why they look so weird.

610
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,291
I see.

611
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:07,333
Your brain regained
the sensitivity of a child's mind

612
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:10,458
while retaining the knowledge
and experience of an adult.

613
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:14,125
Your rare sixth sense
has saved two people!

614
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,375
This is a fantastic achievement
that'll revolutionize psychotherapy!

615
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,916
Well, if they disappeared,
then why are they part of my body?

616
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,833
About that, please have a look at this.

617
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:41,250
Could that woman see homunculi, too?

618
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:42,875
Who knows?

619
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:45,458
This picture is a self-portrait she drew.

620
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,458
The homunculi transferred…

621
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:05,916
This is the first thing I thought of
when I heard your story.

622
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:09,708
I told you that some people
can see homunculi and others can't, right?

623
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:10,625
Yeah.

624
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,833
For example, people with similar interests
are drawn to each other.

625
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:18,083
If minds have similar problems, 
their homunculi are drawn to each other.

626
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,291
In other words, 

627
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:24,416
the yakuza and high school girl
may seem different from you,

628
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,041
but maybe your mind has similarities.

629
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,791
You must be joking.
I'm not a monster like them.

630
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,833
But their stress disappeared, right?

631
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,583
And it's been transferred to you.

632
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,041
Feeling guilty, living according to
someone else's rules…

633
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,041
Does it sound familiar?

634
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:49,708
Your own problems
have begun to surface.

635
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,291
My problems?

636
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:00,375
That woman in red with the flat face.

637
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:03,125
You felt something
different about her, right?

638
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,750
You're looking at the homunculi,

639
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:20,416
but the homunculi are looking at you too. 

640
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:24,291
You know what that means, right?

641
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:30,041
It means that you, yourself,
are a homunculus.

642
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:47,333
So? What's this woman doing now?

643
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,500
She committed suicide.

644
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,666
Did you already know that?

645
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,583
Yes.

646
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:02,916
She drew this picture before she died.

647
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:19,750
Close it.

648
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:24,708
Huh? But it's only been four days.
Stop joking.

649
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:27,375
Just hurry up and close it now!

650
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:33,166
Y-You've turned into
a completely different person.

651
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,958
Nakoshi, have you noticed it?

652
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:38,833
You weren't this emotional four days ago.

653
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,416
You said you didn't care
if you turned into a vegetable. 

654
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,041
That's why I told you…

655
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:48,708
I'd give you a reason to live
in seven days…

656
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,416
I will not die with those monsters!

657
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,791
Okay, I understand!

658
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
In exchange, I have one condition.

659
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:09,000
Before I close the hole, 

660
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:12,250
please look at my homunculus.

661
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:15,791
I told you.

662
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:18,625
I didn't see anything.

663
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,791
-Nakoshi.
-What?

664
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:25,166
I know when you're lying.

665
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:47,250
Do you see yourself…

666
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:50,750
inside me too?

667
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,250
Nakoshi.

668
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,375
Don't be stupid.

669
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,833
Your own problems
have begun to surface.

670
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,458
That woman in red with the flat face.

671
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:43,208
You felt something
different about her, right?

672
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:51,041
SUSUMU NAKOSHI, ENGAGEMENT MANAGER
CONSULTING DEPARTMENT

673
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,083
NANAKO

674
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,583
Nanako…

675
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:57,458
Do you have a business card?

676
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:58,375
Wow…

677
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,333
-Mao, want mine?
-Handsome with a Porsche.

678
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:01,833
-I don't want it.
-What a catch.

679
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:02,916
-Seriously!
-Yeah.

680
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:04,416
Aren't you being too forward?

681
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,708
Any girl would want him.

682
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:08,958
There's more to a man than just money.
He should be accepting, too.

683
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:09,958
Yeah.

684
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,708
Can you live off of being accepting?

685
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:12,625
-You can.
-Yeah.

686
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,250
But Nakoshi has everything.

687
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:17,125
Yeah, you're right. 

688
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:18,791
Even if the guy's accepting, 

689
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,666
if he's ugly and doesn't have
a stable job, what's the point?

690
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,500
Nice to meet you. I'm Nakoshi.

691
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:25,833
What's your name?

692
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:29,416
NANAKO

693
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:42,916
Empty.

694
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,958
Nakoshi! Let's go drink some more!

695
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,541
Nakoshi!

696
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,208
Nakoshi?

697
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:11,375
-Hey! Nakoshi!
-Nakoshi!

698
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:29,791
Nanako.

699
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:58,500
DAY FIVE

700
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:13,666
Nanako!

701
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,583
Huh?

702
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:19,041
You're Nanako, right?

703
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,708
What's wrong?

704
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,916
I'm not sure.

705
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:38,125
Huh?

706
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:43,083
I've lost my memory.

707
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:55,125
Do you… know me?

708
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,541
I want you to come with me.

709
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:47,666
ITO

710
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,208
You don't have to answer that?

711
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,416
Yeah. It's fine.

712
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:47,250
Did I live here?

713
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:54,208
"Empty."

714
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,125
Huh?

715
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:59,083
When we first met…

716
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:03,000
that's what you told me.

717
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,083
With that one word,

718
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:09,125
I was saved.

719
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,041
I, too…

720
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,583
had forgotten who I was.

721
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:26,625
But…

722
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,875
when I found you…

723
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:36,875
I remembered.

724
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:46,458
Here.

725
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,250
Is this…

726
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,125
mine?

727
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:04,250
You… used to like it.

728
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,541
Did we…

729
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,250
live together?

730
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:30,708
Yeah.

731
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,958
We were happy

732
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:36,291
living together, 

733
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:37,958
Nanako.

734
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:44,625
Nanako?

735
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:46,541
Nanako, what's wrong?

736
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,166
Are you okay?

737
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:55,083
Nanako.

738
01:14:58,458 --> 01:14:59,541
-Nanako.
-No.

739
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:01,791
I don't remember anything.

740
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,291
Nanako, calm down.

741
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:05,958
Nanako.

742
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:09,041
Nanako.

743
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:13,375
Take it slow.

744
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:32,416
Am I…

745
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,000
Nanako?

746
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,625
Yes.

747
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:51,333
You…

748
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:54,875
are Nanako.

749
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:48,500
DAY SIX

750
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,291
I can't see it.

751
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:47,291
I can't see it…

752
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:51,208
No way…

753
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:53,541
Hey!

754
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,041
It's me!

755
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,333
Hey!

756
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:06,541
Hey!

757
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,458
Hey…

758
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,250
Hello?

759
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:48,791
It's been a while.

760
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,583
Where are you?

761
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:56,958
That's what I want to ask you.
You ignored my calls.

762
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:59,958
Oh, and don't mess up my room.

763
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,291
Are you the one
who did trepanation on Nanako?

764
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,625
I wasn't expecting this.

765
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:13,291
What a surprise.
I never imagined that you'd run into her.

766
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,625
Why didn't you tell me?

767
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:19,250
Well, that's a good question. 

768
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,666
But the answer
is none of your business.

769
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,041
Of course it's my business!

770
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,875
Nakoshi, please calm down.

771
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:30,708
It would be boring
if I explained everything to you.

772
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:34,083
Today's the sixth day. 

773
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:38,583
The experiment you promised to do
isn't over yet.

774
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,583
I got myself back. 

775
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:47,000
And the other homunculus parts
have disappeared.

776
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:49,791
Too bad. 

777
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:53,625
I can't see homunculi anymore. 

778
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:55,708
Your experiment is over.

779
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,875
Oh, really? 

780
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:59,375
That's good.

781
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:02,916
Thanks to you,
I've just about proved my hypothesis.

782
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,041
You've proved it?

783
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:12,500
Of course, it's all reality to you.

784
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:14,583
I'm not denying that.

785
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:19,250
You saved your dear girlfriend
and got together again. 

786
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:22,291
And you can't see
homunculi anymore, right?

787
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:25,750
What are you trying to say?

788
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,041
Nakoshi,

789
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:32,416
maybe this world is nothing more
than an illusion created by the brain.

790
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:40,166
I mean, I said that you yourself
might be a homunculus, right?

791
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:45,958
The homunculi show you
what you want to see.

792
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,750
Everything is just your own imagination.

793
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,458
No, that can't be true.

794
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,375
I'm sure I saw it.

795
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:00,875
No.

796
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:04,666
It means that this world is a convenient
illusion created by the brain.

797
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:06,333
You see? 

798
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:11,458
Well, I don't mean to destroy
your happy ending…

799
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:16,875
but the real her
is going to remember everything soon. 

800
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:19,833
She's going to remember the real world.

801
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:33,416
Remember?

802
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:38,166
What's this "real world" bullshit?
What are you thinking?

803
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:42,791
You might find out that some memories
shouldn't be remembered.

804
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:45,125
What exactly are you trying to say?

805
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:48,666
Nakoshi, don't you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

806
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:51,041
You saw her homunculus too, right?

807
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:53,416
Yeah.

808
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:55,541
I saw it.

809
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:58,083
She was in red…

810
01:25:58,166 --> 01:26:01,041
But that was only in your world.

811
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:07,125
Unlike you, nothing happened to her
after she underwent trepanation.

812
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:11,500
So my experiment went no further.

813
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:16,083
But she brought about
an unexpected turn of events.

814
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:22,000
Because she met you.

815
01:26:23,416 --> 01:26:26,166
But you can't see homunculi anymore.

816
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,750
And you can't protect her.

817
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:38,416
Unfortunately, the thing that was wrong
was your brain itself.

818
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:43,666
H-Hey…

819
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,041
Nanako…

820
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:54,666
Ito?

821
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:02,125
I knew it was you… 

822
01:28:04,916 --> 01:28:07,583
Right, Chihiro?

823
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,625
Chihiro?

824
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:38,208
Nanako.

825
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:46,958
But the real her
is going to remember everything soon. 

826
01:30:47,916 --> 01:30:49,875
She's going to remember the real world.

827
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:16,916
Nanako…

828
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,083
Hey…

829
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:38,416
Who are you?

830
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:43,791
Who… are you?

831
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,208
No!

832
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:48,583
No…

833
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:51,958
-Nanako…
-Let go of me!

834
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:56,875
No…

835
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:00,875
I want to see the real you.
I have to see it! 

836
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:01,791
Okay?

837
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:04,083
It'd be better
if you didn't know the real me!

838
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:05,833
I want to know the real you anyway!

839
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:06,916
Okay?

840
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:09,000
Nanako!

841
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:12,208
I killed her…

842
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:21,875
The one who killed Nanako…

843
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,333
was me.

844
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:29,375
I've told you over and over again!

845
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,583
You did tell me! 

846
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:33,500
But I didn't think
my mom would be that mad.

847
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:34,916
You should have known!

848
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,666
She's always like that,
like at the funeral the other day.

849
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:38,708
That was different.

850
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:39,625
Different?

851
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:42,375
-How is it different?
-Shut up!

852
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:50,083
You're such a pain.

853
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:53,541
I've had enough.

854
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:56,333
What are you doing, Chihiro?

855
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:58,416
Stop! What are you doing?

856
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:03,125
Nanako!

857
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:13,041
Nanako…

858
01:34:24,416 --> 01:34:25,708
Nanako…

859
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:32,333
I didn't want to remember…

860
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:38,958
No…

861
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,166
You're…

862
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:19,250
empty.

863
01:35:38,208 --> 01:35:40,708
Hey, over here! The annular solar eclipse!

864
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:43,958
Look!

865
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:49,125
Oh, it was today.

866
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:50,041
Yeah!

867
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:00,625
Oh…

868
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:02,833
They're overlapping.

869
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:04,875
It's coming.

870
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:06,916
Look.

871
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:42,125
I'm not…

872
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:45,750
Nanako.

873
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:10,541
Nanako…

874
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:12,958
-What happened?
-Don't touch me!

875
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,875
Please, Nanako, calm down.

876
01:37:14,958 --> 01:37:17,375
Were you paying any attention to me?

877
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:21,375
You never change.

878
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:26,708
I bet you wouldn't cry even if I died!

879
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,750
You never change.

880
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:36,666
You are empty.

881
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:50,041
PRECAUTIONS FOR DAILY LIFE
AFTER MISCARRIAGE

882
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:10,750
Nanako!

883
01:38:12,833 --> 01:38:14,250
Nanako, wait! 

884
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:16,750
Stop!

885
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:18,666
Nanako, let's talk!

886
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,166
Let me go!

887
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,791
Nanako!

888
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:29,333
Nanako…

889
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:35,041
Nanako…

890
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:09,666
I've wanted to apologize… 

891
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:13,375
I've wanted to say…

892
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:18,333
I'm sorry.

893
01:39:30,833 --> 01:39:31,750
What is…

894
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:36,125
your name?

895
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:43,166
Chihiro.

896
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:51,458
Chihiro…

897
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,666
Chihiro…

898
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:41,958
Wow, Nakoshi. That was amazing.

899
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:46,291
You even saved
the woman who did this to you.

900
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,750
I wasn't expecting that.

901
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:57,166
Can you say "I love you"
to the woman before you now?

902
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:03,375
The feelings inside of you
are for Nanako, right?

903
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:06,708
My experiment got derailed. 

904
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:10,333
It's just an illusion
created by a misunderstanding!

905
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:15,041
And yet,

906
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,625
you're comforting each other.

907
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:23,125
You're projecting yourself onto others
and getting high off the feeling.

908
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:26,166
Are you okay with that?

909
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:29,125
I thought you didn't want
to die with a monster.

910
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:30,125
Hey.

911
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:35,000
Why are you getting so worked up?

912
01:41:37,375 --> 01:41:39,416
What is it about me…

913
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,833
that you want to deny so badly?

914
01:41:46,666 --> 01:41:48,916
The connection between myself and others…

915
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:51,958
It's the homunculi, right?

916
01:41:52,041 --> 01:41:55,458
No. When are you going to wake up?

917
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:56,500
Water.

918
01:41:57,958 --> 01:41:58,791
Huh?

919
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:07,875
You're…

920
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,500
made of water.

921
01:42:20,791 --> 01:42:22,791
Well, at first glance, you're invisible.

922
01:42:25,375 --> 01:42:28,416
But when you get nervous,

923
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:32,875
there are bubbles.

924
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:39,250
Yeah. Here they come now.

925
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:40,916
Over there, too.

926
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:44,000
There, too.

927
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:44,916
No! I told you!

928
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:48,958
It's nothing more than an illusion--

929
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:54,333
I can finally see you.

930
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:08,541
No…

931
01:43:11,291 --> 01:43:12,291
What do you mean?

932
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:18,875
This is… 

933
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:22,500
Oh…

934
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:29,416
It's your father.

935
01:43:41,666 --> 01:43:44,833
So it was hiding there?

936
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:48,375
The goldfish.

937
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:53,750
He kept it as a pet when I was a kid.
It was his only hobby--

938
01:43:58,416 --> 01:44:02,583
Did you… like that goldfish?

939
01:44:04,291 --> 01:44:05,916
Why are you asking me that?

940
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:08,541
Where's this goldfish now?

941
01:44:21,583 --> 01:44:22,833
Your father…

942
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:26,375
Between you and the goldfish,

943
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:29,666
who did your father cherish more?

944
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:37,625
Oh…

945
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:40,708
It's coming out.

946
01:45:00,458 --> 01:45:01,833
It has no eyes.

947
01:45:06,041 --> 01:45:07,166
It can't see.

948
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:14,125
He won't look at you.

949
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:14,875
"Look at me."

950
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:29,666
You want him to look at you… 

951
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:32,875
but he won't.

952
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:42,500
Nakoshi…

953
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:48,958
Look at me closer!

954
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:50,958
Please.

955
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:54,166
The homunculus is gone.

956
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,291
You're lying!

957
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:03,000
Help me…

958
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:07,625
You're the only one… 

959
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,541
who can see me.

960
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:16,958
I've finally found you…

961
01:47:19,958 --> 01:47:21,041
It has to be…

962
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:24,916
It has to be you…

963
01:47:31,333 --> 01:47:36,041
The homunculi aren't the problem.

964
01:47:41,208 --> 01:47:42,791
We both…

965
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:47,166
only wanted to be seen.

966
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:51,958
We didn't try to see the other person.

967
01:47:56,791 --> 01:47:58,541
When you look at the other person…

968
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:03,916
you can create the world.

969
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:29,250
DAY SEVEN

970
01:51:18,875 --> 01:51:20,000
Thanks for waiting.

971
01:51:44,166 --> 01:51:45,250
Let's go.

972
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:50,750
