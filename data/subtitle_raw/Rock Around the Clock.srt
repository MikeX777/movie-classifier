00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,840
Not just onions and turnips.

337
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,720
I hadn't thought dancing
the rock 'n' roll was talent.

338
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,320
Take my word for it, honey.

339
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,310
Any gal that can make
a guy's eyes pop out

340
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,650
The way you can
has plenty of talent.

341
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,730
And nobody can
demonstrate this dance

342
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,730
Better than you
and your brother.

343
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,250
What do you say?
Do we ride the
gravy train together?

344
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,740
How much gravy do you expect
for your trouble?

345
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,020
Well, we'll--we'll split,
60-40.

346
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,090
Corny and i'll take 40.

347
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,540
40%?

348
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,110
You shouldn't
get more than 10.

349
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,370
Now where did you get
that kind of information?

350
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,760
I've read  <i>variety.</i>

351
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,840
Then you should know,
my dear young lady,
that I'm not an agent.

352
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,540
I'm a manager.

353
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,540
It's a common thing
for managers to get 40%,
sometimes even 50.

354
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,040
We'll have to think about it.

355
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,140
All right.
How long?

356
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,100
Until you come down
from that 40%.

357
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,270
In that case,
we'll both think about it.

358
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,850
My name, incidentally,
is Lisa Johns.
This is my brother, Jimmy.

359
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Hi.

360
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
My father owns
the motel.

361
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,320
That's where you can find us
when you've made up your mind.

362
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
Let's go, Jimmy.

363
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,370
Don't look at me,
Mr. Hollis.

364
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,870
If Lisa won't go
for the 60-40,

365
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,880
There's nothin'
I can do about it.

366
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,370
Well,
what does she want?

367
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,870
You got me.

368
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,370
All I know
is we always get 100%
of the onions and turnips.

369
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,380
Leave it to a woman
to make all the trouble.

370
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
Look, why don't you
forget the whole thing?

371
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,380
How are you gonna get booking
for a new outfit like that

372
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,890
Without going
to Corinne Talbot?

373
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,400
Don't worry.
I'll find a way.

374
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,890
Sure.

375
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,390
Corinne's agency
has every top hotel

376
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,890
And nightclub
tied up for bands

377
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,890
And acts from New York
to California.

378
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,410
You won't get anywhere
selling The Comets
into some broken-down dive.

379
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,900
In that case, i'll just
go to Corinne, that's all.

380
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,400
Definitely.

381
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,270
You know, she won't
even let you in her office
unless you agree to marry her.

382
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,360
Oh, she's probably forgotten
all about that by now.

383
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,860
Besides, what's one thing
got to do with the other?

384
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Business is business.

385
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,880
Corny, I'm so sure
about that Haley bunch
and that girl.

386
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,870
If I could just get 'em
signed to a contract
and promote 'em right,

387
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,750
We got a sensation
on our hands.

388
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,850
You want to take it
from old Cornball?

389
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,340
With the face and the figure
on that Lisa doll,

390
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,390
She's probably been
promoted by experts.

391
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,380
Oh, I'm not talking
about that kind of...

392
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,300
Hey, maybe I am.
Sure.

393
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,900
Sure. romance, Corny.

394
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,560
That way I may be
able to soften her up
into making the deal.

395
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,140
Hey, now wait a minute.

396
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,640
These farmers up here
have shotguns.

397
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,160
Ugh, get off of it.
She's no farmer's daughter.

398
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,650
You heard her say so yourself.
Her father owns the motel.

399
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,150
In that case,
he probably has 2 shotguns.

400
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,130
Eh?

401
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,670
Eh.

402
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,570
Oh, boy.

403
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,670


404
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660


405
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Ah.

406
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,670


407
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,170
Get a load of that air.

408
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,670
Take it easy, lad.

409
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,670
What do you wanna do?
Frighten your lungs to death?
Ha.

410
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,800


411
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,760
There's your shotgun bait.

412
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,650
Lisa.

413
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,650
Good morning.
Good morning.

414
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,650
You're up and around
kind of early, aren't you?

415
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,110
It's 9:30.
Most folks have
been up since 5:00.

416
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,170
5:00?

417
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,660
I told you.
It's the air.
Nobody can sleep.

418
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,160
Mr. Hollis, this is
my friend Holly Jenkins.
Hi.

419
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,160
Corny Lasalle.
Hello, Mr. Lasalle.

420
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,170
How do you do?
How about
showing me the town?

421
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,180
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just on
my way for a swim.

422
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,670
Oh, you have a swimming pool?

423
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,170
You might call it that.

424
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,670
I'd be glad to
show you the town.

425
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,670
I'll tell you what,
Holly.

426
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,180
You show Corny the town,

427
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,190
And Lisa will show
me the swimming pool.
Uh...

428
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,180
I'll get my trunks, huh?

429
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Does your friend
always do things
on the spur of the moment?

430
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,690
Depends on
who's wearin' the spurs.

431
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,190


432
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,200
That didn't take long,
did it?

433
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
No, just long enough.

434
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,710
I was wondering
how you'd look
in a bathing suit.

435
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,720
I bet you were.

436
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,290
I must have my imagination
overhauled.

437
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,810
You, uh, even look better
than what I had dreamed up.

438
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,300
Thanks.

439
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Smell the strawberries?
They grow wild around here.

440
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
You come here often?

441
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,310
Often as I can.

442
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,820
That must be
what makes them wild.

443
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,260
You don't waste much time.

444
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,810
It's my imagination.
It's in a hurry.

445
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,830
Men's imaginations
are always faster
than they are.

446
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,320
Oh, what do you
mean by that?

447
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,320
You're leading up to
the point when you think
you can kiss me.

448
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Oh, well,
I don't know about that.

449
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,830
It's all right.

450
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,330
There, it's finished.

451
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,000
Now we can talk
about other things.

452
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Who wants to talk
about other things?

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,620
You do.

454
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
To you, I'm just
a silly, romantic girl

455
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Who'll want to give you 40%
when you should have 10.

456
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,140
No, wait.
I didn't say anything--

457
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,770
Perhaps you won't mind
starting your argument at 30%?

458
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,770
Oh, now, young lady,
if you think you're gonna...

459
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,270
20%?

460
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,480
You're taking advantage.

461
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,490
Isn't that what
you wanted to do to me?

462
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
And you're also
too suspicious.

463
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,830
10%.

464
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,400
Now, look, if you think
I'm a silly, romantic guy

465
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,920
Who's gonna take 10%
when he should have 40...

466
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,410
Ok, you said it.
That's where I heard it.

467
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,910
Do you object to
the way I do business?

468
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,420
I don't know yet.

469
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
20%?

470
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,260
Let's be fair
about this. 25.

471
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,320
Then we have a deal?

472
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Mr. Hollis.

473
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,820
Steve.

474
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,320
Steve.

475
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,160
You are leveling with us?

476
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,240
Honey, managing bands
is my business.

477
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,740
If I don't get them work,
I don't eat.

478
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,260
All right,
it's a deal.

479
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,250
I'll leave for New York
the first thing
in the morning.

480
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,750
Now, Corny will stay here
and work out some more
routines with you, hmm?

481
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,710
I think I'm scared.

482
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,770
There's a lot
of world outside
of Strawberry Springs.

483
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,260
Ah, don't worry, honey.

484
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,680
Why, the public
will dig you the most.
Is that the way you say it?

485
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,270
Yeah.

486
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,780
Remember what
Christopher Columbus
once said:

487
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,770
"The world is no square."

488
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,770


489
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,270
Oh, I'm sorry.

490
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,740
Why, Mr. Hollis.

491
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,240
Hi, Lynn.

492
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,750
It's good
to see you again.

493
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,760
Nice seeing you.

494
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
I hope Miss Talbot
feels the same way.

495
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,250
Well, we can find out.

496
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,750
Mr. Hollis to see you.

497
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,730
<i>Send him in.</i>

498
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,260
No earthquake.
Go right in.

499
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,760
Said the spider to the fly.
Thank you.

500
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,980
Hello, Stinker.

501
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,500
You didn't throw it back out,
so I guess it's all right
to come in.

502
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,500
Hi.
Hi.

503
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,990
I thought you'd be sore.

504
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,490
What about?

505
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,490
Men refuse
to marry me every day.

506
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,010
Only those in
the home for old men.

507
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And you.

508
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Steve, something's
been bothering me.

509
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Why did you lead me
to believe you loved me?

510
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,510
Well, let's put it
this way.

511
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,020
Why did you lead me to believe
you loved all of this
more than you could any man?

512
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,510
What's wrong with it?
It's made me rich.

513
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,510
I offered you
$20,000 a year

514
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,220
And a chance,
if you worked out right,
to become a partner.

515
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,810
Is that bad?

516
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
No, it's good.

517
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,310
Except that
I had my own ideas
on how to become a success.

518
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,820
Or failure.

519
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,310
Yes.

520
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,310
Except that I at least
had my choice.

521
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,400
You're stubborn.

522
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
You know, talbot enterprises
is the biggest agency
in show business.

523
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,790
I don't go around
offering a deal like that
to every man I meet.

524
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,170
Perhaps you should.

525
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,990
You're a cinch to come up
with something better
than old Steve.

526
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,090
Then why did you come here?

527
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,580
Business.

528
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,210
A favor?

529
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,840
No, i--i think I can
make some money for you.

530
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,230
I never discuss business
during business hours.

531
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,600


532
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,560
That's logical.

533
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
How about over dinner?
I have to go to
the chez suzette tonight

534
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,060
To talk to Tony Martinez
about his new booking.

535
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,560
Oh, don't worry about it.
It's on me.

536
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,580
A business expense.

537
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,770
Ok, you've got a deal.

538
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,270
I have a new gown
that shows off my vanity
in the right places.

539
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,950
I know what you mean.

540
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,940
Don't be too stubborn,
Steve.

541
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,620
I'd hate to see you
in the home for old men.

542

543
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,590
♪

544
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660


545
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,180
Well, my pet,
I hope you haven't
forgotten your mambo.

546
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,170
No, it's a little
bit like swimming.

547
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,170
You throw a man in the water,
he'll swim.

548
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,670
He doesn't want
to drown, you know?

549
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,670
I'm not sure
I like the comparison.

550
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,190
Steve,
you're trying
to be a crusader

551
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,930
With an unknown band
such as The Comets.

552
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,930
Tony Martinez is going to be
the top novelty outfit
in the country.

553
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,930
That's why
he's doing business.

554
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,450
After he finishes here
he goes to the West River Club
with The Platters vocal group.

555
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,720
It's a hot group.

556
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,310
Martinez gave
the public something new.

557
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,810
That's why they want him.

558
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,310
Now Haley's got
something new, too.

559
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,320
Look, Corinne, i...

560
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm not
an amateur in this business,
you know?

561
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,830
I didn't just
get off of the bus.

562
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,320
I've been around
a little while.

563
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,570
I think I can pick a winner
as well as the next guy.

564
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,320
You've picked
a few in your day.

565
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,800
Then why don't you do this?

566
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,830
Book the Haley combo
into the right place.

567
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,830
Give 'em a showcase.

568
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,330
And give Lisa Johns
and her brother a chance
to demonstrate the dance.

569
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
This Lisa's a doll, you know?

570
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,010
Looks great,
young, fresh, sparkles.

571
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,100
She can't Miss.

572
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,090
Just how old
is this doll?

573
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,680
Well, she's 20, 21.
What's the difference?

574
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm not sure I know.

575
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,570
Suppose we forget
about the dance act
and talk about the band.

576
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,350
But they work together.

577
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,410
Look, it takes
a great dance team
to demonstrate rock 'n' roll.

578
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,920
The young folks
all over the country
want to see how it's done,

579
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,410
So they can do it, too.

580
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,030
Now, if it's
demonstrated right...

581
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,530
And if I don't book
the band and the act?

582
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,000
Then there's other agents.

583
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,100
You know better.

584
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,010
We'll manage.

585
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,790
Shall we leave now?

586
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,300
Still stubborn.

587
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,310
Let me think overnight about
Mr. Haley and The Comets.

588
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,930
We can decide
in the morning, huh?

589
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,470
They're playing our song.

590
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,990
I never heard it before.

591
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,480
Then from now on
it'll be our song.

592
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,980
Come on, darling.

593
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,510
Mike?

594
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,520
<i>Yeah.</i>

595
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,010
Will you come in, please?

596
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,010
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

597
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,530


598
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
That booking for
the Mansfield School
for girls up in Hartford,

599
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
2 weeks from today.

600
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,520
A graduation prom.

601
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,990
Tony Martinez plays
the date before he goes
to the West River Club.

602
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,530
We still need
an inexpensive band
to alternate with Martinez.

603
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,530
Yeah,
something high-class.

604
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,500
This Mansfield School
is the most exclusive
in the country.

605
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,530
Calls for a real
sweet combo.

606
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,050
You know,
heavy on the violins,
light on the brass.

607
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,540
The booking mean
much to us?

608
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,040
One shot.

609
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,540
Some of these one-nighters
are more nuisance
than they're worth.

610
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,040
That's what
I was thinking.

611
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,550
I have the alternate band.

612
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,050
Who are they?

613
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,050
A new combination.
They're called Haley's Comets.

614
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,550
Soft music, sweet, refined.

615
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,550
Just the thing for
the dear little girls
of mansfield.

616
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,070
Ok, boss,
if you say so.

617
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,060
You know how they'll
be received as well as I do.

618
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,110
I think I know just
how they'll be received.

619
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,630
You know, these, uh,
these lily-white hands
are working too hard.

620
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,120
So you'd rather
put them in dishwater?

621
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,620
Maybe you'd like
playing housewife.

622
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,120
Look, boss,
we're in the right business.

623
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,140
We could write
beautiful music together.

624
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,830
We could book ourselves
into heaven 52 weeks a year.

625
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,910
Hmm.

626
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,420
Such nice words.

627
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,840
Steve could never think
of something like that to say.

628
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Steve Hollis?

629
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,930
He's in town.

630
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,930
Well, I suppose
I can wait for you

631
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,060
As long as you
can wait for him.

632
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,160
I'm changing my campaign.

633
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,650
I'm going to play rough.

634
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,150
You think
that'll get him?

635
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,650
I don't know.

636
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
But i'll know
a lot more when we go
to Hartford in 2 weeks

637
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,670
To hear Haley's Comets.

638
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,790


639
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,790
Lisa.

640
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,790
Steve.

641
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Hi, honey.

642
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,300
Oh, Steve.

643
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,810


644
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,800
Hey, you did that
like you meant it.

645
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,810
We greet all our guests here
like that.

646
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,820
Stevie-boy.
Hi, Corn.

647
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,810
Hi, Steve.
Hi, Jimmy.

648
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,810
Well, are we
big broadway stars,
or aren't we?

649
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,310
Well, let's just say
that, uh, you'll be
close to broadway.

650
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,320
How close?

651
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,330
Hartford, Connecticut.
Hartford?

652
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,820
Yeah, it's a one-night stand.
It's a high school prom.

653
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,320
Tony Martinez and the band
will be there.
No kidding.

654
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Steve, I found somethin' else
while you were gone.

655
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,840
Another outfit. with Lisa
and Jimmy, The Comets,

656
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,330
And this new bunch,
we have our own unit.

657
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,910
What's the name of the act?
Freddie Bell
and the Bellboys.

658
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,420
When they don't work
nights over at the mill,

659
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,430
They come to our
saturday night dances, too.

660
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,920
Are they good?
Oh, yeah.

661
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
All right. now look,
this is a solid chance.

662
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,640
The top booking agent
in the country will be
at Hartford to see you.

663
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,220
The top booking agent.
Corinne Talbot.

664
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,240
Yeah, Corinne Talbot.

665
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,730
You sold your soul
to the devil.

666
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,730
You sold out
for a mess of porridge.

667
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,230
Who's Corinne Talbot?

668
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,000
I told you, porridge.
Only she's no mess.

669
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,440
Uh, Corny's crazy.

670
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,990
Look,
this is a great opportunity.

671
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,990
This can be
the start of everything
for you kids and the band.

672
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,010
Steve,
we're in no hurry.

673
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,500
If you don't
want to do business
with this talbot woman,

674
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,000
We can find other ways.

675
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,670
That's what I told her.
No, it's all set.

676
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,760
Now, we're gonna
rehearse every night
until we leave.

677
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Corny, you tell Haley
and the boys.

You're right.

687
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,430
Still,
the talbot agency should
know what they're doing.

Man, is it going to be
a contrast.

There is to be
no exciting music.

698
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,950

wait until tonight,

701
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,630
To tell me that Haley's Comets
are a jive outfit?

705
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,810
This'll make fools
out of us.

706
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,810
Just out of Steve Hollis.

707
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,330
You weren't kidding.
You are playing rough.

708
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,320
I want Steve broken,
in pocketbook
and in spirit.

709
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,320
You think you'll want
a man who has to crawl
to you on his knees?

710
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,840
I'll decide that
when the time comes.

711
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,830
I want that band to fail,
and I want that girl

712
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,330
To go back to wherever
she came from.

713
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,330
A girl you've
never even seen.

714
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
I heard Steve
talk about her.

715
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,350
It wasn't what he said.
It was the way he said it.

716
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,840
I wonder if you'd, uh,
go to all of that trouble
for me?

717
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,770
You mean, you'd still want me
after what I just said?

00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Well, that's it.
The Comets go on next.

721
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,980

I'm scared stiff.

More telegrams.

1024
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,560
Boss, you can't
go on ignoring this
rock 'n' roll stuff anymore.

1025
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,720
Every hotel and club
in the country
is wiring for information.

1026

The only information
you can give them

1027
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,550
Is that we don't handle
that kind of music.

1028
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,150
Corinne, for Pete's sake.

1029

How far are you gonna carry
this feud with Steve?

1030
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,640
An agency has to
keep up with the times,
or fall on its face.

Steve's in love
with Lisa Johns.

He's not even
looking at other women.

1034
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,070
So you think
it's all decided.

1035
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,160
Lisa wants a ring
on her finger.

1036
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,670
You want to put a ring
through Steve's nose.

Which do you think
he'd rather have?

1038
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,080
The thing to do, dear Mike,
is to see that Mr. Hollis
doesn't have a choice.

1039
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,030
Call Steve
and ask him to come
over this afternoon.

1040

Tell him
it's very important.

For one thing, Jimmy.

1114
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:44,590
She handles class bookings.

1115
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,820
I don't want to see you kids
working in dives.

1116

we won't be able to afford
you guys anymore.

1119

what Corinne's deal is yet.

1120

tell Corinne Talbot that.

1132
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,690
I'll tell you what i'll do.
I'll make you a deal.

1133
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,150
Turn your contract
with the unit over
to the agency,

1134
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,640
And you come in
as a partner.

1135
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,190
Split 50-50 with me
on everything.

1136
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,210
Sell my outfit to you,
so you can sell them
down the river?

1137
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
You'll never get
a deal like that
anywhere else.

1138
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,200
Maybe not.

1139
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,700
No, Corinne,
I think your idea
of a partnership

1140
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,710
Has too many
strings attached.

1141
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,220
Then it's no soap?

1142
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,210
No soap.

1143
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,710
What do you want?

1144
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,210
Bookings.
The best you've got.

1145
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,730
What if we make a 3-year deal
without a partnership

1146
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,220
For The Comets,
the dance team,
and the Bellboys?

1147
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,220
With a good chance
that i'll get them on records.

1148
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,240
You're startin'
to make a little sense.

1149
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,230
I'm prepared to
make such a deal

1150
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,730
With the unit opening
in San Francisco.

1151
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,740
Tell you what i'll do.
I'll talk to the kids,
and i'll get back to you.

1152
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,250
If they're smart,
they'll take it.

1153
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:20,240
It'll guarantee
their future.

1154
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,740
Hmm.

1155
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,240
It won't do your
future any harm, either, hmm?

00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,750
See you later, hon.
Ok.

1157

Get me Lisa Johns
on the phone, please.

1158
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,260
I'm sure you didn't
ask me to have lunch

1159
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,760
For social reasons,
Miss Talbot.

1160
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,680
Steve told you about the deal,
of course.
Yes.

1161
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,760
You know what
that 3-year contract could
mean to you and the boys?

1162
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:49,280
$100,000 the first year,
$200,000 the 2nd,

1163
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:50,720
And $300,000 the 3rd.

1164
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,770
It seems almost
too good to be true.

1165
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,360
There's one thing,
however.

1166
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,270
You're an investment,
Lisa.

1167
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,370
You'll become
an idol of the teenagers,
you'll develop a big public,

1168
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,860
Hundreds of fan clubs.

1169
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,370
College boys will be
voting you

1170
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,380
The girl they'd most want
to get caught in a
compromising situation with.

1171
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,870
My agency will be
spending a fortune

1172
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,870
On your publicity
and exploitation.

1173
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
The bigger you
and the boys become,

1174
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,390
The more money
we'll all make.

1175
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,380
But you're the only
girl with the outfit.

1176
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,380
The only one
that means s-e-x.

1177
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,380
Like a movie star.

1178
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,890
I want my
investment protected.

1179
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,400
Of course,
I can understand that.

1180
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,890
All right, then.
These are the facts.

1181
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:31,390
If you get married,
you won't be worth a dime
to me or yourself.

1182
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,350
The kind of public
you're going to get

1183
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,410
Won't want to think
of you as a married woman.

1184
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,400
In short, you will
have to sign a clause

1185
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,400
That for the life
of the contract, 3 years,

1186
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,410
You will not marry.

1187
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,920
For the life of the contract,
I'm not to get married.

1188
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,410
That's what
the contract will say?
Exactly.

1189
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,410
I don't know why
you're worried,
Miss Talbot.

1190
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,580
No one's asked
me to marry them.
He hasn't...

1191
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,170
I mean, they haven't?

1192
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,170
Just the same.
You never know
when some man

1193
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,170
Is going to come out
from under a rock

1194
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:01,170
And pop the nasty
question at you.

1195
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,520
You'll have to
sign that clause,
or the deal is off.

1196
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,760
If I kept all the boys
from making a lot of money

1197
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,350
Just because
I wanted to be married,

1198
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,180
I'd certainly be
a terrible heel,
wouldn't i?

1199
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,860
The heeliest heel
that ever was.

1200
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,450
How long will it take
to make up the contracts?

1201
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,440
4 days, 5, perhaps.
I'll get on them
right away.

1202
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,890
All right, Miss Talbot,
i'll sign the contracts.
Just the way you want them.

1203
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,780
I knew you were smart.
Then it's all settled.

1204
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,320
You and the boys
leave for San Francisco
at the end of the week.

1205
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,820
Fine.

1206
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,700
Just one word
of advice, Lisa.
Have fun.

1207
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,800
You'd be amazed at
the number of men
around the country

1208
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,790
Who don't want
to get married.

Oh, boy.
Hmm, with all that

1220

You must be
taking your vitamins.

1221
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,210
Corinne,

1222
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,250
I came up with
an idea last night
that wouldn't let me sleep.

1223
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:17,750
About me, I hope.

1224
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,750
About money.

1225
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,250
Well, that's 2nd best.

1226
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,760
Now, the returns are in.

1227
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,270
You and I both know
what rock 'n' roll has done.

1228
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,260
It's got people on
their feet again, dancing.

1229
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,760
Druggists are selling
more Corn plasters than ever.

1230
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,260
So what's your big idea?

1231
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,310
A rock 'n' roll jamboree.

1232
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,350
Keep goin'.

1233
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,440
Now for weeks,
I've had other bands

1234
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,940
And vocal groups making up
rock 'n' roll arrangements.

1235
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,440
Now as I see it,
we take a bunch
of these good acts,

1236
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,440
Put them all
together into
one big show,

1237
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,460
And we'll give
them a night of jive
they've never seen before.

1238
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,450
Now to get
the movement going
coast to coast,

1239
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,450
I think I can talk
one of the big networks

1240
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,950
Into televising us
on a national hookup.

1241
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,960
Son,
you hit the jackpot.

1242
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,970
Now look,
Los Angeles should be
the right spot for this.

1243
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,960
They go for these
big jazz concerts

1244
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,460
And I think
they'll eat this one up.

1245
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:05,970
Who do you want
to stage it?

1246
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,980
Alan Freed.

1247
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,970
You know,
he's handled a
lot of big shows.

1248
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:10,970
Sold.

1249
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,970
Freed can leave
for Los Angeles immediately

1250
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,970
And work with
my coast office.

1251
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,990
Now the first week in july
we rent a great big hall.

1252
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,980
All the kids
will be out of school

1253
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,930
And I think every kid
from 6 to 96 will go
for this in a big way.

1254
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:24,480
July it is.

1255
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:28,500
Freed goes to the coast,
I stay here in New York,
set up the networks.

1256
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,990
You're a genius, lad.

1257
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:31,490
Oh, it's nothing, really.

1258
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,440
Now that there
are 3,000 miles

1259

2 more minutes
and the jamboree
goes coast to coast.

1274
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,800
We've had some big
deals in the agency,
Steve,

1275
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:23,790
But this puts
the icing on the cupcake.

1276
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,390

Darling, who needs him?

1280
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:36,220
Why don't you marry the guy
so he can forget you?

1281
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,810
He works for me.
Let's not talk business.

1282

Hmm.

1283
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,310
One minute.

1284
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:45,810
I suppose you think
I'm 7 kinds of a witch
for the things I did to you.

1285
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,860
8 kinds.

1286
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:50,430
But considering why
you did what you did,

1287
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,030
I suppose
I should be flattered.

1288
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,070
Naturally.

1289
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:53,990
Hmm.

1290
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:58,990
You know, Corinne,
you're not really
a bad sort at all

1291
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,170
If you would, uh,
not try to run
everyone else's life.

1292
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,840
It's the mother instinct.

1293
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,430
Mothers always
do the thinking
for their children.

1294
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,370
That really puts
the icing on the cupcake.

1295
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,340
No, I mean it.

1296
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
Every time the alarm
goes off in the morning,

1297
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:15,340
I begin to wonder
about this idea of
being a career woman.

1298
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,440
Well, you're the boss.
Why set the alarm?

1299
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,100
You're being evasive.

1300
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,100

for the thrill you've
all been waiting for.

1406
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,040
Here is one of the most
phenomenal acts in the history
of show business.

1407
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,040
Bill Haley and His Comets.

1408
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,720

1413
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:39,000
It's a hit, Corinne.
It's a big fat hit.

1414
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:39,990


1415
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:42,490
Now, let's talk about us.

1416
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,010
Oh, everything's
been said, Corinne.

1417
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
From now on,
there's nothing
more to talk about.

1418
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Why not?

1419
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,370
Watch the stage.

1420
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:52,790


1421
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:55,290
Buddy-buddies,
before we go
into our big finale,

1422
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,790
I'd like to introduce
that living doll,

1423
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,810
That real cool
rock 'n' rollin' chick
who wants to say a few words,

1424
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,130
Lisa Johns and
her brother, Jimmy.

1425
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,100
Thank you,
rock 'n' rollers.

1426
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,110
I just want
to say how thrilled
everybody is backstage

1427
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,120
With the way you've
received our show.

1428
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:18,610
And I especially
want to thank
our wonderful emcee,

1429
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,960
Alan Freed,
who helped us put
the show together.

1430
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,750
And an equally
wonderful man

1431
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,240
Without whom,
there would be no
rock 'n' roll at all,

1432
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,160
My husband,
Steve Hollis.

1433
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:37,630
What was that
child talking about?
She said "husband."

1434
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,130
She ought to know.

1435
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,640
Then you are married?

1436
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,150
Legally.

1437
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,140
I have a contract
with that girl.

1438
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,140
I'll sue you, Steve,
for every cent you have.

1439
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,640
I'll ruin you
and her and that band.

1440
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,150
They'll never make
another appearance
on a stage.

1441
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,660
No one breaks a contract
with Corinne Talbot.

1442
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,150
Oh, I don't think you'll
sue anyone, Corinne.

1443
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:59,150
If you recall,
it took 5 days to
draw that contract.

1444
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:02,670
And there's a clause
that says Lisa's not
to be married for 3 years.

1445
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,160
Well, she won't.

1446
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,160
But you just said that--
she can't.

1447
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,330
You see, we were married
before the contracts
were signed.

1448
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,420
Outsmarted by an amateur
from Strawberry Springs.

1449
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,920
I'll tell you one thing,
though.

1450
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,620
I think you and Mike
will be very happy together.

1451
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,220
You know,
you wouldn't be
such a bad guy

1452
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:23,510
If you didn't try to
run everybody else's life.

1453
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:24,800


1454
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,300
Then you're not angry?
No, what good would it do?

1455
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,300
Hmm, Mike Dodd, huh?

1456
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,800
Well, it's a good
thing I had another man
warming up in the bullpen.
