1
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,690
Come on!

2
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm ready!

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,690
Come on!

4
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,810
Come on!

5
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,790
Chocomon?

6
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,480
Chocomon!

7
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,610
There we go.

8
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,880
Oh, Daisuke-kun's going to rage when he sees these pictures.

9
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Pretty much.

10
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,440
Hikari, what's wrong?

11
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,700
Hikari-chan?

12
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,760
I can feel a crying digimon.

13
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,470
Hikari-chan?

14
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,050
It's crying and looking for someone.

15
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,580
What the?

16
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,270
Yamato, you're early.

17
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,650
Chocomon.

18
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,140
Gummymon!

19
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,020
Was Mimi-san taken to the Digital World?

20
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,600
No, it didn't seem like it.

21
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,970
It must be some other world.

22
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,480
I'm interested in that crying digimon you said you felt.

23
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,580
I felt a crying digimon right before Mimi-san disappeared.

24
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,810
It felt very sad.

25
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,930
It's close by.

26
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,780
Chocomon, don't!

27
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,590
A digimon.

28
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,520
Hikari-chan, is this digimon?

29
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,340
It's the crying digimon.

30
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,030
Chocomon, it's me, Wallace.

31
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,870
It's gone.

32
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,900
Hey, you!

33
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,460
Onii-chan!

34
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,450
I just heard his voice.

35
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,810
Taichi-san? Maybe that guy knows something about it!

36
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,180
Takeru, I'll follow him.

37
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,640
Hikari-chan...

38
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Something is... awakening.

39
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,770
Where are we?

40
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,920
It's too dark to see.

41
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,150
I can't think straight.

42
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,530
And it's so cold.

43
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,580
How did we and up here?

44
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,680
How are we getting out?

45
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,430
I don't know.

46
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,880
Takeru, be careful.

47
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,080
Hikari, be careful.

48
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,220
Mom's shopping?

49
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,920
Will you tell her that I'm going to Summer Memory?

50
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,910
No, Summer Memory.

51
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,380
It's OK, I'm gonna call you back again.

52
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,960
OK, I'm gonna call you back. Bye.

53
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,310
Summer Memory...

54
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,770
It's from Hikari-chan!

55
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,100
Daisuke, what's up?

56
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,690
Anything wrong, Daisuke?

57
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,370
Please save my brother.

58
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,980
What's that supposed to mean?

59
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,670
Not only Taichi-san, Yamato-san and Koushiro-san are gone as well.

60
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,030
Anyway, Hikari-chan's counting on me.

61
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,150
How can I refuse?

62
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,110
Miyako-san, you even thought about how to get us there?

63
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,040
Yup.

64
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,190
I don't think anyone will stop if you say we've got monsters with us.

65
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,380
Those are great monsters.

66
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,620
He said these are great toys.

67
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,840
Really?

68
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,950
This guy is weird!

69
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,240
Japanese cars are really great!

70
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,940
He says the car's great as well.

71
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,410
I wish he'd drive better though!

72
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,290
Please keep your eyes on the road!

73
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,480
Made in Japan is really great!

74
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,910
If you say so.

75
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,990
Wallace, I'm tired.

76
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,530
Are we going to that flower field?

77
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,890
Hey, Wallace!

78
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,240
What's with you?

79
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,720
Right back at you.

80
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,570
That might not have been Chocomon, but why did you attack him?

81
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,280
He was serious.

82
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,300
He was seriously trying to attack you.

83
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,570
I could feel it.

84
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,140
So I had to protect you.

85
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,860
Maybe we could have reasoned with him, you didn't have to attack.

86
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,380
But he's no longer who he was.

87
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,210
I don't want to hear that.

88
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,400
OK, I won't say it again.

89
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,670
Your mother must be worried sick by now.

90
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,910
I'll call her later.

91
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,960
It's hot... It's hot... It's hot...

92
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,530
Will you shut up and walk?

93
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,620
It's hot!

94
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,460
We shouldn't have gotten off the train.

95
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,450
Although you do have to call your mom.

96
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,740
It doesn't matter.

97
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,300
Hey, if that really was Chocomon, he'll be at the flower field too, right?

98
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,160
If he is, what should I tell him?

99
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Chocomon didn't like the heat.

100
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,080
Wallace!

101
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,890
What are you doing?

102
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,230
I'll be your hat from now on.

103
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,520
You're heavy.

104
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,550
Don't worry about it.

105
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,980
Daisuke-kun said they're getting on a plane now.

106
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,070
The plane's called Denver Bird.

107
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,200
My D-3!

108
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,090
They're gone!

109
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,920
Everyone on the train is gone.

110
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,630
Goodbye, Mr. Denver!

111
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,270
Thank you!

112
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,930
Where are we?

113
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,040
We're about 500km from Denver.

114
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,500
The hell?

115
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,480
Well, we did get here really fast.

116
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,200
Jeez, when will I get to see Hikari-chan?!

117
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,830
Hikari-chan, wait for me!

118
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,960
You stopped the truck.

119
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,080
That's the power of love!

120
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,640
Oh.

121
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,290
Guess they didn't stop for us.

122
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,440
I'll ask them to let us on too.

123
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,280
They said we can get in too.

124
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,440
Get on!

125
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,970
Let's go.

126
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,840
Up you go.

127
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,170
You guys get on too.

128
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,910
Hello.

129
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,790
What are you doing?

130
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,670
Sorry, it's my cat.

131
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,530
Daisuke, it's a digimon!

132
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,210
Then you're...

133
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,810
The boy Takeru-san was talking about.

134
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,090
I didn't know Japan had digimon too.

135
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,730
Wow, look at my new friends!

136
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,100
He's pretty friendly.

137
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,410
Don't let your guard down.

138
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,800
You can speak Japanese.

139
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,210
I had a Japanese girlfriend.

140
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,120
Wallace did his best to learn Japanese.

141
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,270
Then it wasn't you guys who took Taichi-san and the others to another world.

142
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,500
Call me Wallace.

143
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,600
Your name is Miyako, right?

144
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,590
I like your long hair.

145
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,910
Don't be getting to chummy.

146
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,580
It's good manners to compliment girls.

147
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,750
What's with this guy?!

148
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,160
Wallace-san, where did you meet Gummymon?

149
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,480
An egg came out of my mom's computer one day.

150
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,580
She's always surfing the Internet.

151
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,070
Have you ever been to the Digital World?

152
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,950
Digital World? What's that?

153
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,210
It's...

154
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,510
You look great even when worried, Miyako.

155
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,030
What are you even thinking?!

156
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,300
Wallace-san, do you know anything about that other digimon?

157
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,410
I've always known that he was taking children that had a digimon away.

158
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,130
So you do know something!

159
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,620
You'd better spill it right now!

160
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,880
We found a car!

161
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,170
I have to hurry ahead.

162
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,690
So do we, to save Taichi-san and the others.

163
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,190
Daisuke, you can tell that story in the car.

164
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,040
Hurry up!

165
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,020
And why are you hitch-hiking here anyway?

166
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,210
Weren't you going to Summer Memory?

167
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,250
That's because we got off the train to call Wallace's mom.

168
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,020
Gummymon...

169
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,530
Your mom? Did you hear that?

170
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,930
Daisuke, we'll be waiting at Summer Memory!

171
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,870
Hurry up and get there!

172
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,860
Wallace, we could make it if we run.

173
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,640
Yeah, but I'd feel sorry for Daisuke-kun.

174
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,760
Damn it, I'm never gonna see Hikari-chan!

175
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,530
Guys!

176
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,710
Taichi?!

177
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,100
You got younger.

178
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,450
Taichi-san, how old are you now?

179
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,430
Wallace, we're going the wrong way.

180
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,580
No, that's not what I mean! Listen to me!

181
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,110
Hey, Wallace!

182
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,350
Wallace doesn't listen to a thing I say, but he's really clumsy.

183
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,320
Daisuke is way clumsier.

184
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,190
So he's just like Wallace.

185
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,260
Mom, don't worry.

186
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,960
If you don't stop worrying you're gonna lose weight.

187
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,600
Hurry up, we have to catch up to the others.

188
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,980
Wallace's mom is this big!

189
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,090
That's the opposite of thin.

190
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,370
I'm not running away!

191
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,370
I just wanted to take a manly trip.

192
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,740
Yeah, "manly", yelling "mom" all the time.

193
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,870
Shut up!

194
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,240
No, not you.

195
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,050
I'm hanging up.

196
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,180
Wallace's mom is scary.

197
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,570
That's trouble.

198
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,240
You're such a blabbermouth.

199
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,380
So are you.

200
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,840
You're pathetic.

201
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,080
I guess the Japanese don't care about their parents so much.

202
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,000
What?

203
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,630
What's this?

204
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,130
Daisuke!

205
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,120
Chocomon...

206
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,840
That's the digimon that appeared in New York.

207
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,580
Chibimon evolves to...

208
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,060
V-Mon!

209
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,690
Go, V-Mon!

210
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,170
Digimental up!

211
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,750
V-Mon armor evolves to...

212
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,400
Flaydramon, the fire of courage!

213
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,150
Go, Flaydramon!

214
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,860
Knuckle Fire!

215
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,570
What's going on?

216
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,140
It's mad.

217
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,280
I did feel anger just now.

218
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,180
But whose?

219
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,200
Hey, what did you do with Taichi-san and the others?!

220
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,580
Flaydramon, don't give up!

221
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,080
Stop!

222
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,620
Chocomon, stop.

223
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,790
Wallace, be careful.

224
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,020
Where did you take the Japanese children?

225
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,410
Why are you doing this?

226
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,210
It's no use.

227
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,690
He's not the Chocomon you remember.

228
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,230
Chocomon, do you remember me?

229
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,250
I'm Wallace.

230
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,530
Wallace.. Wa... No...

231
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,540
You're not Wallace.

232
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,700
Where is Wallace?!

233
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,680
Chocomon, don't you recognize me?

234
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,690
Chocomon?

235
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,720
Wallace...

236
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,700
You evolved.

237
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,670
Stop!

238
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,380
Chocomon...

239
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,240
Chocomon, I'll be waiting at that flower field.

240
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,460
I'll be waiting for you!

241
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,670
Will he wait for me?

242
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,560
And it changed again.

243
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,380
Huh?

244
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,700
A blue sky?

245
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,640
It feels like summer.

246
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Yeah, the sun's shining and everything.

247
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,750
What's going on?

248
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,990
I think this might be inside someone's heart.

249
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,730
Why did you stop us?

250
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,120
And why did you tell that monster where you're going?

251
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,740
None of your business.

252
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,650
You said his name is Chocomon?

253
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,720
I don't have time for your questions.

254
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,190
I'm going on ahead.

255
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,210
Daisuke!

256
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,970
What are you two doing?

257
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,080
That looks like fun! Let me ride!

258
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,960
Gummymon, be careful.

259
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,550
Don't worry, Wallace!

260
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,890
You be careful.

261
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,090
Let me ride!

262
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,280
I can't... see...

263
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,260
Well, I warned you.

264
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,380
Next time be specific.

265
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm back to Chibimon.

266
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,280
Wallace, you're never straight.

267
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,730
Shut up, Gummymon!

268
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,200
And are you OK?

269
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,980
Yeah.

270
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,690
Well, I'm not.

271
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,250
Japanese children are so sturdy.

272
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,140
So you can evolve like that too, Gummymon.

273
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,790
Back to hitch-hiking! We need to find a car!

274
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,700
Wallace!

275
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,730
I don't think a car's going to come, since the road was destroyed.

276
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,960
I wish you were smaller.

277
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,410
I could fly away with you.

278
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,270
Why are you going to Summer Memory?

279
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,490
What's over there?

280
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,380
Wow, this is easy!

281
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,830
Sorry for crashing you.

282
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,930
Don't mention it.

283
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,400
You said you would meet him at a flower field.

284
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,960
What did you mean?

285
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,380
I'm sorry, V-Mon.

286
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,620
I'm fine.

287
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,860
That digimon, Chocomon, do you know something about him?

288
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,540
Chocomon is...

289
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,210
Gummymon.

290
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,850
Wallace, Chocomon is turning the captured children back the way they were.

291
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,810
What do you mean?

292
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,610
He wants to make them younger.

293
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,630
How do you know this?

294
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,820
Because I'm...

295
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,350
Anyway, we have to get to Summer Memory.

296
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,940
Daisuke, leave it to me!

297
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,860
Digimental up!

298
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,620
V-Mon armor evolves to...

299
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,180
Lighdramon, the roar of friendship!

300
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,180
OK, get on!

301
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,430
Awesome!

302
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,170
This is different from before.

303
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,100
This is great!

304
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,650
Lighdramon, you're amazing!

305
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,620
Which way is Summer Memory?

306
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,560
Don't be shy.

307
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,480
Yeah but...

308
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
But what?

309
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,280
Everyone's watching.

310
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,250
Your digimon's great, it has many evolutions.

311
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,500
Well, yeah.

312
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,690
Hikari-chan, I'm coming!

313
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,400
Still not here?

314
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,010
Nope.

315
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,030
Wait...

316
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,290
What is it?

317
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,750
Daisuke-san!

318
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,120
Finally!

319
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,350
Sorry we're late!

320
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,380
This place is so rural.

321
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,050
Unlike New York.

322
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,030
Wallace, you're not very honest.

323
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,870
Why isn't Hikari-chan here?!

324
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,360
You're just as noisy as always.

325
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,350
She sent us an e-mail.

326
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,470
Chocomon appeared on the train.

327
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,320
Because of that the train stopped and they're taking a bus here.

328
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,600
Why?

329
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,270
That's not all.

330
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,140
Everyone on the train disappeared.

331
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,970
All the people?

332
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,930
Wallace-san, please tell us.

333
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,830
What kind of digimon is Chocomon?

334
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,840
I think it's about time you told us.

335
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,860
Where were Taichi-san and the others taken?

336
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,180
Wallace, it hurts...

337
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,840
Are you OK, Chocomon?

338
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,080
Chocomon?

339
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,160
Hey!

340
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,600
He's probably looking for Wallace, and taking people with a Digivice.

341
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,000
He wants to see Wallace.

342
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,890
But he wants to see the young Wallace.

343
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,110
So that's why he kidnapped everyone.

344
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,120
Just tell us already!

345
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,880
How are you connected to that digimon?

346
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,770
I have to get to that flower field.

347
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,720
If I do, I'm sure Chocomon will go back to how he was.

348
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,570
Wallace...

349
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,030
Where are we going?

350
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,620
Let's play!

351
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,260
OK, let's get going!

352
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,240
Hitch-hiking again.

353
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,840
Well, Hikari-chan and Takeru-kun had money, we don't.

354
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,250
Hey, weren't we supposed to do something?

355
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,970
Yeah.

356
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,290
Hey Wallace, is it OK if I call my mom?

357
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,150
If you can find a pay phone.

358
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,990
Wallace, aren't you sleepy?

359
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,150
I'm so... tired...

360
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,260
Hold it.

361
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,740
Going alone?

362
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,130
You know, I've been thinking.

363
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:38,740
Is Chocomon your digimon?

364
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,130
I'm right, aren't I?

365
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,680
Chocomon was born out of the same egg as Gummymon.

366
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,610
They're twin digimon.

367
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,970
Digimon twins?

368
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,650
I was shocked when two digimon that looked alike came out.

369
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,410
It was hard to keep it from Mom.

370
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:12,900
Seven years ago, we were playing in a flower field.

371
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,160
Chocomon suddenly disappeared.

372
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,560
Seven years ago?

373
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,010
That's about the time Taichi-san and the others witnessed their first digimon.

374
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,260
The timing fits.

375
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,760
So that's when it happened.

376
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,140
I couldn't stop thinking about Chocomon.

377
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,940
Even after I moved to New York.

378
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,510
We got along so well.

379
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,280
Why did Chocomon turn into that thing?

380
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,300
I hated myself for not saving him.

381
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,700
So we were fighting against your digimon?

382
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,610
Against your precious friend?!

383
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,540
There's no way that was easy for you.

384
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,420
I could never do that.

385
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:23,160
If V-Mon was ever to become something else, even something terrible, I'd...

386
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,150
I'd never be able to kill him.

387
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,780
Daisuke...

388
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,570
But we have to kill him, to save Taichi-san and the others.

389
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,160
What's the right thing to do now?

390
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,590
This isn't something you should cry over.

391
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,810
But...

392
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:02,680
If we were to meet... meet again in that flower field...

393
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,030
Chocomon might turn back to normal.

394
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,700
Yeah.

395
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,400
You're right, he will.

396
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,330
And then we wouldn't need to fight him, and we could save your friends.

397
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,650
Yeah, there'd be no need to fight.

398
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,900
Why the heck am I comforting you?

399
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,860
Yeah, that's just what's going to happen.

400
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,690
I can just feel it.

401
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,290
You're such a simpleton.

402
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm just easy to understand.

403
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,130
And you're OK with that?

404
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,700
Weren't you praising me?

405
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,600
I was not.

406
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,800
So don't try to go alone, OK?

407
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,040
He's right.

408
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,630
I'm coming too, Wallace.

409
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,010
Gummymon.

410
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,260
I can't let you go alone.

411
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,940
But you loved him so much.

412
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,640
I can't let you two fight!

413
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,250
Wallace.

414
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,210
You know I'm right.

415
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,430
I'll be fine.

416
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,720
I want to come with you.

417
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,440
What will you do?

418
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,170
Let's go back.

419
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,460
I want to see Miyako's sleeping face.

420
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,400
You can look at my sleeping face!

421
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,260
If we don't go back, you might catch a cold.

422
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,600
Wallace!

423
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,670
Wallace!

424
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,110
Who's that?

425
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,330
Wallace! Wallace!

426
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,360
Wallace!

427
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,350
Wallace?

428
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,320
Wallace!

429
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,960
Wallace?

430
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,840
Wallace! Wallace!

431
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,640
Wallace! Wallace!

432
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,810
Who are you?

433
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,910
They're not right. They're smaller, but they're wrong.

434
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,750
They're wrong! They're all wrong!

435
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,820
Chocomon!

436
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,430
W-Wallace...

437
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,590
Wallace!

438
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,490
Chocomon, do you know who I am?

439
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,320
W... Wa... Wallace...

440
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,840
Let's play together, like before.

441
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,220
Together?

442
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,560
Yes!

443
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,130
Then, let's go home...

444
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,780
Back then...

445
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,620
Isn't that why you came here?

446
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,690
It's cold. There's nobody here.

447
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,200
Chocomon, don't do that.

448
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,180
Out of my way!

449
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,180
Chocomon, how could you hurt Gummymon?!

450
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:16,670
I want to go back! I want to go back!

451
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,960
I'm sorry, Chocomon, those times are gone.

452
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,660
We have to start from here.

453
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,470
Come here!

454
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,090
Come over here!

455
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,010
But I...

456
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,860
...can't go.

457
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:46,910
No!

458
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,940
Wallace...

459
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,040
Daisuke...

460
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,800
Can you beat him, Daisuke?

461
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,920
Will you help me do it?

462
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,140
V-Mon... let's go!

463
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,070
Digimental up!

464
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,730
V-Mon, armor evolves to...

465
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,710
Flaydramon, the fire of courage!

466
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,640
Let's go, Armadimon!

467
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,130
Digimental up!

468
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,190
Armadimon, armor evolves to...

469
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,080
Digmon, the steel of wisdom!

470
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,440
Let's do it, Hawkmon!

471
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,870
Digimental up!

472
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,640
Hawkmon, armor evolves to...

473
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,790
Holsmon, the wings of love!

474
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,180
Hey, isn't Chocomon just playing with us?

475
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,240
Playtime is over, Mr.Bunny.

476
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,120
Well said, Flaydramon!

477
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,730
You are very strong, but we won't lose!

478
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,960
I'm still here!

479
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,830
They're all so cool!

480
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,310
Though Digmon's line was a little too plain.

481
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,680
He's just like you.

482
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,750
He ran away?

483
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,680
That can't be!

484
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,580
Is that Chocomon?

485
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,490
Is he trying to change the world?

486
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,080
What a cold world.

487
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,510
It feels like my very heart is frozen.

488
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,960
Were we taken somewhere else?

489
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,530
This isn't our world, it's...

490
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,870
Black snow?

491
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,220
It seems like it's flowing out of his broken heart.

492
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:21,590
It might seem pretty, but it's proof that his heart is frozen.

493
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,280
Who...

494
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:35,890
Who are you?

495
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,930
I'm back to rookie!

496
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,400
This is it!

497
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,600
I can't evolve to Flaydramon!

498
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,730
What are you trying to do?

499
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,840
Stop.

500
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,090
You'll pay!

501
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,240
Stop... Please stop!

502
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Gummymon!

503
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,510
Wallace, be careful.

504
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,950
Look out!

505
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,860
Ever since you went away...

506
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,240
...I was always thinking...

507
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,810
...I have to protect Wallace by myself!

508
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,760
Gummymon!

509
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,600
Gummymon!

510
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,730
So I have to...

511
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,350
I will protect him!

512
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,480
I know what you mean, Gummymon.

513
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,020
V-Mon!

514
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,210
Hawkmon!

515
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,620
We all want...

516
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,220
...to protect those we love.

517
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,890
Hawkmon, stay with me!

518
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,820
Miyako-san, I can't breathe.

519
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,540
Armadimon!

520
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,840
I will protect you!

521
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:35,850
I understand.

522
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,150
Daisuke was right, I am naive.

523
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,920
But, Chocomon is not part of you.

524
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,170
No, you took Chocomon.

525
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,670
He's lonely, but he's trying his best.

526
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,430
And you've locked him away somewhere.

527
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,810
If I fight, and defeat you...

528
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,540
...I'll be able to take Chocomon back

529
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,710
I want to fight too!

530
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,310
I want the power.

531
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,560
Wallace, that's why I'm here.

532
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,690
I will be your power.

533
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,310
Gummymon!

534
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,090
Wallace.

535
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,330
You're not naive.

536
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,230
You've traveled so far, searching for Chocomon.

537
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,740
And you're just a kid.

538
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,090
We all have something we want to protect.

539
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,310
No matter how weak we are...

540
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,340
...we will fight to protect.

541
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,470
We will never stop trying!

542
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,050
You got him!

543
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,810
Daisuke-kun!

544
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:36,810
Takeru-san!

545
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,540
Daisuke-kun!

546
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,620
Hikari-chan!

547
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,370
No, you're not the one!

548
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,240
You're not the digimon that was crying!

549
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,960
Holy Arrow!

550
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,960
It's not over, is it?

551
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,680
But where are we?

552
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,500
Is this the Digital World?

553
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,470
It's cold.

554
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:47,280
Is this where Chocomon was?

555
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,420
All alone?

556
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,340
No.

557
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,520
This is still our world.

558
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,970
The world was modified, for that digimon's sake.

559
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,610
You're back to Upamon.

560
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,180
You're out of power.

561
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,840
I can't feel anything from that digimon.

562
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,380
Wallace, we're in big trouble!

563
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,500
Daisuke, what do we do about this?

564
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,220
Wallace, I'll protect you!

565
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,610
For Chocomon as well!

566
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,960
Poromon, you've done more than enough!

567
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,910
What are you doing?

568
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:57,050
We're not afraid of you, so come on!

569
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,540
Daisuke!

570
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,220
Daisuke, you've shrunk!

571
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,980
Wallace, what happened to you?

572
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,170
I'm a kid again!

573
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,200
Me too...

574
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,420
This is bad!

575
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,760
If this keeps up, we'll disappear.

576
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,530
Takeru, we need to evolve to Ultimate.

577
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,620
Hikari, evolve me to Ultimate!

578
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,350
I'm sure that will bring about some sort of solution.

579
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,960
Combine light and hope!

580
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,560
Alright!

581
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,280
Let's do it!

582
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,490
Angemon, warp evolves to...

583
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,900
Seraphimon!

584
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,440
Angewomon evolves to...

585
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,660
Holydramon!

586
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:50,740
This is Angemon's...

587
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:52,910
Angewomon's...

588
00:54:58,820 --> 00:54:59,970
Ultimate level?

589
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,170
These are your Digimentals!

590
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,350
The digimentals of miracles!

591
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,450
Ours?

592
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,710
Our...

593
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,970
Wallace! Digimental up!

594
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,160
Digimental up!

595
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,750
Did we get him?

596
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,950
I don't know.

597
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,830
We did it!

598
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,930
His heart is so black.

599
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,060
It's too dark, I can't see.

600
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,680
I can't feel anything.

601
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,770
I must protect Wallace.

602
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,650
Who is... Wallace?

603
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,110
Chocomon, Gummymon...

604
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:02,630
Where are you?

605
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,950
I must go!

606
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,860
No, you can't go like this!

607
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,840
V-Mon, hold on, I'm coming!

608
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,890
Gummymon, I've always made you worry, haven't I?

609
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,760
I can hear someone's voice.

610
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,300
It sounds so familiar...

611
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,600
Daisuke...

612
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:58,630
Wallace...

613
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,610
I haven't given up yet.

614
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,750
Just like I always believed I'd find Hikari, I'll never give up.

615
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,510
You've always done your best.

616
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,560
I've never doubted you, even for a second.

617
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,560
And I never will.

618
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,300
Chocomon! Gummymon!

619
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,130
V-Mon!

620
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,710
Daisuke!

621
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,120
Wallace!

622
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,860
Gummymon, are you sure?

623
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,760
Yes, please, V-Mon.

624
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,950
V-Mon!

625
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,930
Chocomon?

626
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,270
It's you, isn't it?

627
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,130
Wallace!

628
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,700
Chocomon always cried a lot.

629
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,100
But now, he was smiling.

630
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,200
Gummymon!

631
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:05,600
One day...

632
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,290
One day...

633
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:11,760
One day, Chocomon will come back to you guys.

634
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,450
Taichi-san and the others are back safely.

635
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,360
I'll come visit you in Japan someday.

636
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:36,950
Yeah!

637
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,150
But for now, I guess I'll keep traveling for a while.

638
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:46,960
That's for goodbye!

639
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,340
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

640
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,330
I'm guessing someone's jealous.

641
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:52,350
Indeed.

642
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,460
I wonder if he'll really visit?

643
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,760
He's not getting near Hikari-chan!

644
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:13,890
Mom, I'm going to come home very soon.

645
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,810
No, I'm not saying I hate it at home.

646
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,480
I miss you so much.

647
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,410
Mom, you know that I love you.

648
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,170
You spend a lot of time on the phone.
