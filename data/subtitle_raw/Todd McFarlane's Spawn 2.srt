1
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,360
"Where do the dead belong...

2
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,280
in the world of the living".

3
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,920
"For this newest spawn
moments of peace never come".

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,800
"His memories are fragments
of the life he once had".

5
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,720
"For a Hellspawn,
memories will play...

6
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,240
his soul's own personal hell".

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,560
Hey, you're going to
have to speak up, Al.

8
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
If you want to be heard.

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
Boy, what are you doing, tough guy?

10
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
Let me guess.

11
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,360
You're just now remembering
who torched your sorry ass.

12
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,800
I love it when that happens.

13
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,640
Time for you to learn something
from all this, Spawn.

14
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,800
No one can be trusted.

15
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,720
This world isn't about trust.

16
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,480
It's about dominance and submission.

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,440
It's about power!

18
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,360
It's never about trust.

19
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,240
I mean you couldn't even trust
your sweet little Wanda with...

20
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,280
good old Terry, right?

21
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,800
You're alone now, Spawn.

22
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,920
Ain't no one covering
your back anymore.

23
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,080
I love it when you get rough.

24
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,040
Go on, do it!

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
Let yourself go, Spawn.

26
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,440
You got the killing fever.

27
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,520
"Winter has brought
the Hunter's Moon...

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,880
with its cold white to light."

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,520
"The Hunter's Moon is so bright...

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,520
that predators choose this night
for the hunt."

31
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,760
"And tonight, in the alleys...

32
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,280
Spawn can sense
that he is the hunted one".

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
Hey, Al, come on over.
It's warm by the fire.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
"The Hellspawn hides himself away...

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,160
with that instinct
which predators have".

36
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,120
"Away from weariness,
confusion and torment".

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,040
"They choose solitude".

38
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,960
"Hiding in the shadows".

39
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,840
They are not your enemies.

40
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,160
- They are the only friends you have.
- Friends?

41
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,920
They are my enemies!

42
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,120
"A Hellspawn is returned to earth,
soulless".

43
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,800
"His mind ravaged,
his memory shattered".

44
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,320
They took everything from me!

45
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,240
They made me a monster.

46
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,400
Mr. Amir,
with your country's reputation...

47
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,680
no one in the free world
will sell you these kinds of weapons.

48
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,960
Except for me.
400 million wins you a war.

49
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,520
Wynn, you're a beautiful man.

50
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,520
You start a war
and then sell arms to both sides.

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,040
Whoever wins,
you're his new best friend.

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,760
You have your directives.

53
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,320
It's not working for me.

54
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
The alley location
doesn't make sense.

55
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Missile fragments were found
in those alley.

56
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,680
Serial numbers match
our missing weapons.

57
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,200
Let's get something clear right now.

58
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,760
I own you, I'm not interested in
how you think things should work.

59
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Understood?

60
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,320
And Special Ops has recon
the target for you.

61
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,360
Why am I wasting my time
with this bullshit?

62
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
We got guns in practically
every third world country.

63
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
What's so special about these?

64
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,560
I need those guns
off the street, Chapel.

65
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,800
That ordinance is traceable to me.

66
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,440
Chapel, did you hear what I said?

67
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,000
Tonight.

68
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,760
I've never seen a moon like that.

69
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,640
Weird shit always happen
when we have a moon like that.

70
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,320
- Get down!
- I don't like it.

71
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,280
My God.

72
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,920
Shit!

73
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,080
Alright, now that I have
everybody's attention.

74
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,280
Let's get this over
with real quick, okay.

75
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,440
There were weapons fired
in this alley.

76
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,960
They look like this.

77
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,000
One was a shoulder-fired missile
it makes a big noise.

78
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm sure you would remember it.

79
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,080
Tell me where they are
or I'll put your worthless...

80
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,480
piece of shit life
out of your misery.

81
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,440
I don't know.

82
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,640
No. I think you're smart, old fart.

83
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,320
Now let's just see how high
that IQ of yours is.

84
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Tell me where the guns are.

85
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,280
But I don't know.

86
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,800
Maybe Al.

87
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,000
Al?
Is Al the the guy...

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
who knows things around here?

89
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,080
Okay. Let's go talk to Al.

90
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Hey, you're going to have to speak up
if you want to be heard.

91
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,200
Jesus. He was just a kid.

92
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
Never thought this job
would come to this.

93
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,760
What? You're going to have
to speak up, Kid...

94
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,280
if you want to be heard.

95
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,480
It's not just a job.

96
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,400
It's an adventure.

97
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,080
Al.

98
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
- Night, Angel.
- Night.

99
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,360
Night.

100
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,400
Every night you put Cyan to sleep
and then you go back to the agency.

101
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,360
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

102
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,280
I want to keep you safe, Baby.

103
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,880
- The less you know, the better.
- I don't understand these stuff.

104
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,520
You're a desk jockey.
A nice safe job.

105
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,760
I like knowing I won't get
a phone call in the night...

106
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,000
saying you're missing or dead.

107
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,120
I think I found something
that they didn't want me to find.

108
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,320
And sometimes there's an agency
inside the agency...

109
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,000
keeping a lot of secrets.
But...

110
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,560
I'll get it all straightened out.

111
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,840
I have to go.

112
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,120
Be careful.

113
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,880
Wanda.

114
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,920
I forgot something.

115
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,160
- I love you.
- I love you too.

116
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,840
I'll always come home to you.

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Don't worry.

118
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,080
Come on, Amos,
tell me what you know.

119
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't know.

120
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Look at that.
Broken glass.

121
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,160
Good as a scalpel.

122
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,560
Don't.

123
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,040
The guns.

124
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,920
Our guns, Amos!

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,640
It's not like you're protecting
the family jewels.

126
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,880
But hey, I could cut those off too.

127
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
Well.

128
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,360
What have we here?

129
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,920
Al.

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,320
Al.

131
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,080
Are you, Al?

132
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,360
What is this,
Gay Pride Day or something?

133
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,280
Hey, I like the mask, but I think
the cape is a little much.

134
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,760
Why the hell would you do that?

135
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,640
Stand up and I'll show you.

136
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
Son of a bitch!

137
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
It's you.

138
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,800
Chapel.

139
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,440
I remember you.

140
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,520
It's okay, Amos.
I got you.

141
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,640
- What the fuck?
- Jess Chapel.

142
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,520
Joliet, Illinois, right?

143
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,240
Say what?

144
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,120
That's where the state prison is.

145
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,160
Where you were born.

146
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
Jess Chapel.

147
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,920
Who the fuck are you?

148
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,680
Your worst fucking nightmare.

149
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,440
Say it!

150
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,080
Al?

151
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,440
Yeah, we know each other real well.

152
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,040
I know you buried
that girl in Guatemala.

153
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,480
I even know about
that singer in Rio.

154
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,960
Don Juan of killers you said.

155
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,400
You're not him...

156
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,200
You're not him!

157
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,040
Why don't you tell me who I am?

158
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
Tell me.

159
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,880
Tell me who I am!

160
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,680
Simmons?

161
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,720
I want you to feel what it's like...

162
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,520
trapped in a box no light, no air.

163
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,840
Suffocating in the darkness
and left to rot.

164
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,240
Jesus Christ.

165
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Okay.

166
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,480
Internal investigation records
entry 75.

167
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
Tracking shipments
of ground-to-air Patriot missiles...

168
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,080
to client countries.

169
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Now running the numbers
on TOW missiles.

170
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,800
Israel-Kuwait database
confirmation of serial numbers...

171
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,680
ordinance shipped and received?

172
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,040
I guess the world
sleeps safely tonight.

173
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,440
But I don't trust numbers.

174
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,920
Let's see if a satellite can verify.

175
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
Cross-referencing global positioning.

176
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,520
No signal.
No position given.

177
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,760
Jesus, those missiles never arrived.

178
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,520
One of my own.

179
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
Give me a name.

180
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,520
Cerebus,
that's a deep black project.

181
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,200
Bypassing security codes.

182
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,720
Someone removed the transmitter.
Where the hell are these weapons?

183
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,240
Fitzgerald.

184
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,640
Shit!

185
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,640
Terry?

186
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
Terry?

187
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,000
No one cares about that, come on!

188
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,360
Can you hear me, come on?

189
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,400
What you doing? He's dead!

190
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
The whole fucking building
fell on him.

191
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,200
Shit!

192
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,000
I trusted you with my life.

193
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,800
A hundred times.

194
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,880
We were partners, Jess.
Brother!

195
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,480
Come on, Jess.

196
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,280
Work the scenario.

197
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,920
Just like the old days.

198
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
Show me why you did it!

199
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,720
You take off the lens cap?

200
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,480
Wynn sent me to find you.

201
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,360
Said you're gonna be my albatross.

202
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,800
I think you're called a partner.

203
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,040
So you're the one
who took a bullet for liberal.

204
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,920
I guess that's dedication,
all right.

205
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,480
The president's a president.

206
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,840
Is that right? In covert ops,
maybe not always.

207
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,240
What's so funny?

208
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,040
I'm here because I killed
the fuckin' assassin.

209
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,680
You know,
the one you let get away.

210
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,600
You were the only one I let in.

211
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I trusted you.

212
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,200
Why?

213
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,640
You stupid son of a bitch.

214
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,760
You were always the target!

215
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,480
From the day we met,
my job was to whack you.

216
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,120
When the time came.

217
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,440
Who gave the order?

218
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,240
Who was it?

219
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,880
It was Wynn.

220
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,600
He gave me the order,
but I wanted to do it.

221
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,880
Wynn?

222
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,280
Guess I won.
I won.

223
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,800
Know me.

224
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,320
Jesus Christ!

225
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
No!

226
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
You're not him!

227
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,400
Touch it.

228
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,880
It's real.

229
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,800
Feel it, you made it.

230
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,160
No, you can't be alive.

231
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,560
I'm not, asshole.

232
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
You took everything from me.

233
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,400
Hey, you have to speak up, Al,
if you want to be heard.

234
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,240
God.

235
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,840
Simmons.

236
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,840
Kill me.

237
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,440
Kill me!

238
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Finish it.

239
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,120
There's no coming back.

240
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,640
No.

241
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm going to let you live.

242
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,520
Longer than you want to.

243
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,800
No.

244
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,960
You can't do this to me!

245
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,160
I killed him.

246
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,880
I killed him
and he came back from the dead.

247
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,400
No one can come back!

248
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
But he...

249
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,640
he did.

250
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,960
Why, Jess?

251
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,720
- Why?
- They're coming back.

252
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,320
I've killed them.

253
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Look, they're coming back.

254
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,560
I've killed them.

255
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,160
They keep coming back!

256
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,200
I've killed them,
but they come back.

257
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,080
He keeps coming back.

258
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,480
I will die for you.

259
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,200
"Born out of darkness,
a hell spawn is isolated...

260
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,800
confused...

261
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,640
tormented".

262
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,200
"He finds no solace
in his own thoughts".

263
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,200
"They are distorted,
twisted, grotesque".

264
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,800
"Whatever fragments of
memories that remain...

265
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,920
are not his own".

266
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,360
"They are intruders".

267
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,280
"Memories are his enemy".

268
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,680
I always wanted you, Wanda.

269
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Terry, you're more of a man
than Al ever was.

270
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm glad we got rid
of that son of a bitch.

271
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
God.

272
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,720
Terry.

273
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,240
No!

274
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,400
Stay out of my dreams!

275
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,080
Your dreams?

276
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,080
Malebolgia owns you.

277
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,440
You are his bitch.

278
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,400
You know what I've said.

279
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,200
Nothing but a cheap sin
than a bad complexion.

280
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,040
Don't you get it, Spawny?

281
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,160
Your friends all fucked ya!

282
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,680
This is getting embarrassing
this Wanda fetish you have.

283
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,920
I don't want to hear her name
from your filthy mouth!

284
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,440
Yes!

285
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,480
Nice shot, Spawny!

286
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,040
But I think you're dealing
with some misplaced anger here.

287
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,560
Don't get pissed at me.

288
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,280
I'm the one who's helping you out.

289
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,160
And I'm not the one
who stole your wife.

290
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,960
But hey, think about it.

291
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,920
Just how well
did you know Terry anyway.

292
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,400
Terry...

293
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,360
Why don't we have Fitzgerald
shake hands with Mr. Amir...

294
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,960
they're such old friend.

295
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,440
- What are we really looking at here?
- A traitor, Mr. Bergen.

296
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,320
And he's about to be dealt with.

297
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,520
What some men will do for money,
it's a travesty.

298
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,720
Selling missiles
to a known terrorist.

299
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,120
- The voice?
- The voice is even easier...

300
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,480
than the visual, Mr. Wynn.

301
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,320
Psychological profile?

302
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,880
Paranoid, delusional.

303
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,880
It reads like a Greek tragedy.

304
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Shame how quickly a man
can crash and burn.

305
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,800
Splendid observation, Bergen.

306
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,800
I suggest you keep it in mind
should you ever be tempted...

307
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,400
to sharpen your skills.

308
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,880
I'm aware of your reputation, sir.

309
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,800
Of course, you are.

310
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,760
Your fee has already been wired.

311
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,960
- Yes?
- Fitzgerald on the loose.

312
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,280
I want my missiles moved out of
that warehouse tonight.

313
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,680
Right now.

314
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,640
Merrick will have coordinates
for delivery.

315
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,240
And...

316
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,640
send me Leon, now.

317
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,000
Fitzgerald is a traitor...

318
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,960
and how does
our agency handle traitors?

319
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,280
They're liquidated.

320
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,560
I want you to use Leon
and that hillbilly kid.

321
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,480
I don't trust that hillbilly.

322
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,360
He worked for the Russian mob.

323
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
I trust him.

324
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,280
Hi.

325
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,400
You've been gone for hours, baby,
what's wrong?

326
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,080
I've been walking around...

327
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,800
thinking.

328
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,960
I just I want to see you inside
and tell you that I might...

329
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,560
might be gone a few days.

330
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,400
What's going on?

331
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,880
I feel like my whole life is
elapsing around me.

332
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,760
Terry, talk to me.

333
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,360
I'm tired. I'm just so tired.
I can't think straight.

334
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,200
- I have to go.
- Now?

335
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,760
Terry, it's 3.00AM.

336
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
You have a wife and a child.

337
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,800
- Let someone else take care of it.
- I'm all alone on this.

338
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,960
You're doing fieldwork, like Al did.

339
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,560
Don't lay that on me, Wanda.
You've got to trust me.

340
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,080
- I have to do this.
- Trust?

341
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,440
Don't ask a widow for blind trust.
I trust with my eyes wide open.

342
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,480
So, you better tell me
what's going on, right now!

343
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,440
I can't. I'm trying to protect you.

344
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,760
"Al used to say the same thing".

345
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,320
"You're not protecting me".
"You're scaring me".

346
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,760
"I won't raise
a fatherless child, Terry".

347
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,960
"Thanks for all the support".

348
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
"But I have to go".

349
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,400
He's en route.

350
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,760
Where's he going?

351
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,880
On the way to the warehouse.

352
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,840
You won't be killing him,
he's mine.

353
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,440
Hey, Buddy, you okay?

354
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,440
Holy shit.

355
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,480
Unit 12.
I need backup. Riverside and 10th.

356
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,840
Ten of hours to bring in one guy?

357
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,200
What is he, dusted?

358
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,000
No drugs in his system.

359
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,640
The doctor seems to feel
there is some sort of brain damage.

360
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,240
Shit, where they picked
this guy up?

361
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,040
The alleys where we're investigating
those murders, Sir.

362
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,480
- Coincidence?
- I don't believe in coincidences.

363
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,280
Neither do I, Sir.

364
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,720
Right down there.

365
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,360
Shit.

366
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,160
Well,
there's the problem right there.

367
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,160
He's just too much makeup.
That could drive a guy nuts.

368
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,160
Ritualistic markings
very primal, yes.

369
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,320
African warriors
use similar markings.

370
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,480
The skull signifies death.

371
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,960
Looks military.

372
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,520
Special Forces training.

373
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,240
No tags.

374
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,200
- Mercenary maybe.
- His fingerprints...

375
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,880
have been burned off.

376
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,120
It'll be hard to make
a positive ID.

377
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,520
Looks like we got ourselves
a real pro.

378
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,840
Al!

379
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,280
Christ!

380
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,600
No!

381
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,480
I killed him! Do you hear me?
I killed him!

382
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,840
Do you hear me, I killed him!

383
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,680
Confession of a fruitcake.
Probably nothing.

384
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,720
Check the alleys
for another body anyway.

385
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,080
There's nothing left
but you comeback you've gone...

386
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,360
Yes?

387
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,200
We just picked up one of your boys.

388
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,960
A trigger man with a skull painted
on his face, sound familiar?

389
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,720
I want him cut loose.

390
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,320
I don't think you do.

391
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,640
He looks like
he's been through a war.

392
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
Guys a fucking time bomb.

393
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,160
All right.
I'll attend to it myself.

394
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,240
Chapel.

395
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,240
Another disappointment.

396
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Who the fuck are you?

397
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
Get your hands off me!

398
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,560
Selling arms to a terrorist.

399
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,160
That was an improper thing to do,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

400
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
This is bullshit!

401
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,240
Of course it is.

402
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,680
Anything more to say?

403
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,400
You can't just...

404
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,960
You just resisted arrest.

405
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,600
Holy shit!

406
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,200
Call in B-team.

407
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,320
Fitzgerald's got backup.

408
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,040
Hello, Leon.

409
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,880
He's got help.
Kill both of them.

410
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,080
Move away from the desk.

411
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,320
Now drop your gun belt.

412
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,000
Put your hands behind your back.

413
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,040
How many people are here?

414
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,680
Just a couple this shift,
it's mostly automated.

415
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,080
Cut the phones and the security.

416
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,960
This was supposed to be
a piece of action...

417
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,840
now suddenly we have wet works
inside a building...

418
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,840
I have no blueprints for, Merrick.

419
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,080
I'll be your eyes and ears, Leon.

420
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,600
I don't like a woman
watching my back, they're too soft.

421
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,880
Not Merrick.

422
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,600
We did a hard contract
against a Russian mob.

423
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,840
She got a hit and left behind.

424
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,000
- They used her badly.
- I'd like to use her badly.

425
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,920
You talk too much.

426
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
Shit!

427
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,880
Hey wait!

428
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,120
Shit.

429
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,680
I have to find those missiles.

430
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,320
It's the only way out of this mess.

431
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,960
Come on.

432
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,160
It's have to be in here.

433
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,640
Yes!

434
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,120
Got them.

435
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,600
Shit!

436
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,000
Hey, you have to call the police.

437
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,200
Lady.

438
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,680
"I don't know
if you boys have noticed...

439
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,600
but our target is about to escape".

440
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,400
"If you take your thumbs
out of your asses...

441
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,080
you might be able to catch him".

442
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,120
He's up there.

443
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,040
This old boy is a hard dog
to keep under the porch.

444
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,520
When I catch this little Jackrabbit,
I'm going to skin him.

445
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Don't underestimate this guy.

446
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,360
He's a boy scout, he doesn't know
what he's going to do next.

447
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,080
I know some of those Russians,
who were they?

448
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,000
Don't know,
after America was done with them...

449
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,760
they couldn't identify the bodies.

450
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,800
Jesus!

451
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm just doing my job, goddammit.
Why are they doing this to me?

452
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,320
Hey, Little rabbit.

453
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,200
You down the rabbit hole?

454
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,480
What are you waiting for?
Pop him.

455
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,040
The asshole took your old lady.

456
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,040
He torched you, you dumb shit.

457
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,360
As sure as if it was his hand
and the torch...

458
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,600
he needed you gone.

459
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,760
Come on.

460
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,480
If ever there was a motive
that every fucking body understand...

461
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,240
it was "He took my woman."

462
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,480
I need him alive,

463
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,400
Until I know the truth.

464
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,800
Let's see.

465
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,880
"Beautiful young woman desires
generous man for new situation".

466
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,640
Not bad.

467
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,240
Open Vault 73.

468
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,720
And then go for the cops.

469
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,600
There it is.

470
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,120
Holy shit.

471
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,640
These are the numbers.

472
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
The numbers match.
Jesus.

473
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,880
Wynn.

474
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,440
He's a traitor.

475
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,240
Got him.

476
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,040
Too bad, Little lady,
wrong turn.

477
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,680
Give me the truth.

478
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,280
Al, if I knew who did it,
I'll take them down.

479
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,600
I'll take care of it, Buddy,
I promised.

480
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,360
Good luck up there.

481
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,440
It's true.

482
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,080
You didn't know.

483
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,120
This is a little very messy.
I keep a clean house.

484
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,040
Leave.

485
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,240
Or we all go.

486
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,200
I've got nothing to lose.

487
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,960
You won't do it.

488
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
You don't have the balls.

489
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,720
Desk jockey.

490
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,920
That's your whole problem.
You're just not the type.

491
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,240
Goddamnit!

492
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,520
So, what?

493
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,240
So, you gave him permission,
so he didn't know.

494
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,360
Did he have to screw her?
He could've been platonic, right?

495
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,320
Did he have to slam it
to her every night?

496
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,880
Every year I asked them
to keep his grave better.

497
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,840
And every year
they let it go to seed.

498
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,560
Terry, don't leave me
the way he did.

499
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,880
Promise me no field assignments.

500
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,840
Hey.
I won't leave you.

501
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,080
I'm a desk jockey
and I'm proud of it.

502
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,520
Al was my best friend.

503
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,800
He only asked me
to do one thing for him...

504
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,720
take care of you.

505
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,400
I promised him I would.

506
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,160
He's laying over there.

507
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,960
Hey, Boy scout, you made that fun.

508
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,400
Shit!

509
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
You're not going to die
on this roof.

510
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,520
Take care of Wanda

511
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,400
Until I come for her.

512
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,440
"This time, the Hellspawn
kept the demons at bay".

513
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,480
"But he knows
they will always return".

514
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,600
"To torment him".

515
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,640
"Making him blind".

516
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,200
"To the truth".

517
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,240
You let him go? Why?

518
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,720
What did you say?

519
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,080
You!

520
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,320
Old bum!

521
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,600
When you let him go, you took a step
toward freeing yourself.

522
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,760
How the hell do you know?

523
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,480
How do you know any of it?

524
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,480
I know.

525
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,760
You're not the only one
touched by this curse.

526
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,800
Who are you?

527
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,480
"In the city...

528
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,680
a river of humanity rushes past".

529
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,080
"Leaving behind in the alleys,
the refuges".

530
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,000
"Those that become lost
in the mind".

531
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,160
"The sick and the broken".

532
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,200
"Spawn shares this alley
with the lost souls, who like him...

533
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,440
long to escape their wounded
and tormented existence".

534
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,960
"Does he feel anything at all?"

535
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,680
"Or is his heart dark and empty?"

536
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,680
"With no shreds of humanity left".

537
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,640
"Is the Hellspawn even aware
that his presence...

538
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,400
causes the destruction
of those closest to him?"

539
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,800
"Those he had hoped...

540
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,400
to protect".

541
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,400
Everyone's in place, Merrick.

542
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,400
"Wynn still inside with the wife".

543
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,480
"If Fitzgerald comes home,
wait until when walks out...

544
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,080
...and then kill them all".

545
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,480
Wanda, you've created
quite a stir at the NSC.

546
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,080
I don't like getting the runaround.

547
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,680
This has become
a very dangerous situation for Terry.

548
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,480
Who knows
what he's capable of doing.

549
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,320
He needs to turn himself in, Wanda.

550
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,720
He's not a criminal.

551
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,520
You and I both know that.

552
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,640
But his behavior.
It's erratic.

553
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,600
- He's stressed.
- You love him.

554
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,480
But to the NSC,
he's considered a traitor.

555
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,520
That is not Terry.

556
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,760
I hope it's not.

557
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,320
If he calls you here,
you must tell him to contact me.

558
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm his only hope.

559
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,920
You've already lost one husband...

560
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,920
and it would be a shame
to lose another.

561
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,480
Hey, you're having a rough one?

562
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,400
- Saying something?
- A rough night.

563
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,280
You don't want to know.

564
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,400
- You want to talk about it?
- No thanks.

565
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,520
- Going to use the phone.
- Sorry, I didn't mean it...

566
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,280
Don't worry about it.

567
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,640
If you hear anything, Jason,
please call me.

568
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,080
Hello?

569
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,120
Hey, good luck!

570
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,440
What's this fucking box.

571
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,880
Damn, this is good.

572
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,880
Thing about donuts,
they're all this vitamins of dozen.

573
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,720
I don't want to see
anymore of you, fucking bums.

574
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,320
You scared our customers away!

575
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,920
We' trying to do business here,
all right?

576
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,960
Tell your buddies I don't want to see
a single goddamn bum in this alley.

577
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,200
You stink, man!

578
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,640
Don't you have
any respect for yourself?

579
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,960
Personal offense
for made me smell you.

580
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,000
Come on, sticks, let's go!

581
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,360
Let's get out of here, man.

582
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,320
Jesus!

583
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,680
That was close.

584
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,320
- Please don't hurt me.
- Okay, police.

585
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,240
- Please.
- It's okay, Hank. It's us.

586
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,200
Please don't hurt me.

587
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,760
- Easy.
- Wait.

588
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,360
Easy does it, Hank.

589
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,360
What's going on down here, Hank?

590
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,680
He's going to come down
and destroy you.

591
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,320
He's coming.

592
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,720
You'll see he's coming.
and going to destroy you.

593
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,440
- He needs to sleep it off.
- You'll see. You watch!

594
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,000
He's not going
to let this go in vain. You'll see.

595
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,880
That's a paranoid schizophrenia, Sir.

596
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,960
You'll see.
He... He will protect us!

597
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,160
That's great.
Add that to the heap of weird shit...

598
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,800
going on down here.

599
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,280
You're going to see something!

600
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,360
Everyone will see.
He's coming.

601
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,520
Judgement. He's coming...

602
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,960
Excuse us.

603
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,720
- Watch it!
- You watch it.

604
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,800
We have to do it, man.

605
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,080
Have you two thought about my offer?

606
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,160
You'll make a lot of money with me
doing the Lord's work.

607
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,800
Shit, man.

608
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,840
Hey, you.
Who's your man?

609
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,040
Grab some fence.
Yeah, you need to stay right there.

610
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,640
Hey, Preacher man,
aren't you recruiting...

611
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,880
kind of young these days?

612
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,760
We all work for the Lord.

613
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,800
Yeah, work dead.

614
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,320
You don't understand
our work here.

615
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,920
You're going to leave
those kids alone, you hear me?

616
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,840
You're going to get
the hell out of here.

617
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,280
I think they got religion, Sir.

618
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,080
Cops. What a fucking joke.

619
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,760
That wasn't the cop who force
Johnny and his boys out.

620
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,840
It was some kind of ghost
who scared him off.

621
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,400
You know, Johnny was Creole.

622
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,560
They're always
spooked by shit like that.

623
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,560
We own these alleys now.

624
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,640
I want a steel door,
bars on the windows.

625
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,640
And get rid of the bums.

626
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,280
Next.

627
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,320
Brother.

628
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,000
Are you seeking salvation?

629
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,520
Hey.

630
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,720
What is this?

631
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,000
- We don't take checks.
- That's right, Mr. Wall Street.

632
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,320
Cash only to be saved.

633
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,440
You already sniff all your stocks
and bonds up your nose?

634
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,240
It's cash only, asshole.

635
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,280
Bless you, sister.

636
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,120
Let me ease your pain.

637
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,080
In the end...

638
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,080
they are all lust for hell.

639
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,400
What the hell.

640
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,400
Hey!

641
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,560
Hey, why you running out,
Dude Cinderella?

642
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,920
No one listens to me.

643
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,960
I hate it when people
don't listen to me.

644
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,800
Won't be needing guns for this.

645
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,360
Easy, Danny boy.
My brother just want you...

646
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,080
to rough them up like last time.

647
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,840
I warned you, freaks.
You didn't listen to me.

648
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,520
This is our alley now.

649
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,200
Let me go!
I... I won't bother you!

650
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,000
Man, you made me look like a boat
in front of my brother, man.

651
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,640
I can't take that.

652
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,320
What?
Come here!

653
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,240
The Guardian's
going to take care of you!

654
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,280
No.

655
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,880
God.

656
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,240
Joe.

657
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,760
He used to sing me songs.

658
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,480
Joe was nice to me.

659
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,720
God.

660
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,720
We came here because
of The Guardian.

661
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,720
He was going to protect us.

662
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,800
I don't know, Lucy.
Maybe they were just stories.

663
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
No.
He's our angel.

664
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,320
Our guardian angel.
He's ours, he knows how we feel...

665
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,120
because he's like us.

666
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,120
Maybe Joe didn't believe.

667
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,720
You have to believe him, Arnie,
or he won't come.

668
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,240
That's what you're supposed to do.

669
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,800
Poor Joe.

670
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,480
Why do we have
to throw him away like this.

671
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,960
The water is so dirty and cold.

672
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,440
No.

673
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,200
Please.

674
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,000
Please.

675
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,680
Please no.

676
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,480
Please don't.
please.

677
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,520
Take Lucy away.

678
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,000
Lucy, let's go.

679
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,240
Joe's going to be okay, Lucy.

680
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,800
No one can heard him now.

681
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,400
Yeah.

682
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,400
That's right.
No one can heard you now, Joe.

683
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,680
Two whole months?

684
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,160
I wish I didn't have to go.

685
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,360
Well, how about something nice...

686
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,200
to remember me by?

687
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,440
Where is he?
He was supposed to protect us.

688
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,920
Judgement.

689
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,160
- Hey, it's me, Hank.
- You scared the shit out of me, man.

690
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,640
Hey, could I have a drink, man,
please.

691
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,760
Thanks.

692
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,040
Easy.

693
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,400
Man, you said you're the one
who told us about him.

694
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Why isn't he here?

695
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,000
Is he going to do anything?
Like a cops or...

696
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,400
Maybe he's not real,
just more of your your drunk talk.

697
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,880
- He's real, Hank.
- I'm telling you.

698
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,720
He's bullshit, Gareb!

699
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,080
It's him!

700
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,160
It's real...

701
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,200
There you are.

702
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,840
Hey, Al.
I've been looking for you.

703
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,480
Hey, wait.

704
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,960
Wait.

705
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,760
You hear what happened to us?

706
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,320
That gang.

707
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,760
They went and the sons of bitches
went kill Joe.

708
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,080
Bastards killed him.

709
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,080
Al, help us,
we have to do something.

710
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,800
What should I do with them?

711
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,920
Kill...

712
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,600
I mean,
I don't know what I mean.

713
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,640
Get rid of them!

714
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,920
I don't do other people's killings
anymore, Gareb.

715
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,360
I feel nothing for you or the others.

716
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,400
This place has the stink of Hell
all over it.

717
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,320
I'm good to no one...

718
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,800
I can't even help
the ones I care about.

719
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,560
Al, we're all just scared!

720
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,000
Al, please, I've told everybody
that you will help us, protect us.

721
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,760
There's so many of us here now.
We're trapped here just like you.

722
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,600
Prisoners.

723
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,280
- Answer the question, Shad.
- Please, I...

724
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,720
I'm looking for someone.

725
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,880
One of my disciples,
real skinny guy.

726
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,000
No... I... I...

727
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,800
- Well...
- Answer him.

728
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,800
He's got something of mine,
it's my Bible...

729
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,680
and it's very important to me.

730
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,240
The Guardian,
why don't you ask him?

731
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,240
The Guardian? Brother,
I'm your only Savior in these alleys.

732
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,000
A real smart ass?

733
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,720
Have you seen the skinny guy?
And I know if you're lying.

734
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,640
I haven't seen him.

735
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,560
If you do see him,
come and find me.

736
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,000
- Let's go.
- Arnie.

737
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,840
Arnie?

738
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,920
Well, what have we here.

739
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,920
Maybe this one there was something.

740
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,920
Is that yours?

741
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,920
That is one big piece of ass, man.

742
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,560
Arnie, are these your friends?

743
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,760
Right, Baby.
We're friends.

744
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,280
Yeah, that's it.
We're all friends here.

745
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,000
- Right,
- Yeah.

746
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,640
Hey, Arnie
why don't you dance with her?

747
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,120
Please.
Please, leave us alone.

748
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,040
Let's go, Donny.

749
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,040
Leave us alone, is that right?

750
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,200
- Lucy. No!
- Come on, Baby, dance.

751
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,600
- I like to dance, Arnie.
- Lucy come on!

752
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,080
Yeah, show me those legs,
that's it.

753
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,520
The old broad's wasted.

754
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,920
Lucy!

755
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,560
Do it!
Yeah!

756
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,360
Do it!

757
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,600
Baby! Yeah!

758
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,880
Lucy.

759
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,280
- Lucy
- He's playing music for me, Arnie.

760
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,440
Enough!

761
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,720
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Enough you little shit

762
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,080
- Let's go, Donny boy.
- I'm just having a little fun.

763
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,000
Donny, before that old guy
kicks your ass.

764
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,640
You think you could come in here
and push us around, humiliate us?

765
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,600
We're not leaving.

766
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,320
You're not a nice man.
The Guardian's going to get you.

767
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,080
No!

768
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,640
Hey.

769
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,760
Lighten up, Donny boy.

770
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,480
You go give your guardian
that message, old man.

771
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,480
Lucy.

772
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,280
Lucy.

773
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,240
Move!

774
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,120
Move!

775
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,880
Lucy...

776
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,520
Why don't we bury her
like we do the others?

777
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,680
No!

778
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,720
She was afraid of the sewers,
it's cold there.

779
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,160
I promised her
I'd always keep her warm.

780
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,160
"Cast out of society".

781
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,200
"Taking refuge amidst
the garbage like Spawn himself".

782
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,280
"These unclaimed souls know
they will never be accepted...

783
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:33,120
by the world beyond these alleys".

784
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,280
"So, they remain here".

785
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,840
"Trying to hold on
to their dignity and sanity".

786
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,400
"Hoping for some savior".

787
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,600
"A protector,
someone to redeem them".

788
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,880
You pathetic piece of shit.
You're smoking all the merchandise.

789
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,320
Come here.

790
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,320
I'll kick your scrawny ass.

791
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,040
Where is the fucking book?

792
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,000
Wait, I got it right here, man.
Relax.

793
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,240
You're all... You know,
you worry too much, man.

794
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,680
The fuck?

795
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,680
Where the hell are they?

796
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,920
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to go find...

797
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,720
those two rat fucks right now
and the goddamn Bible...

798
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,840
so we can all get back
to fucking work.

799
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,240
Yeah, well, I'm coming with you.

800
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,760
Stay put.

801
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,800
Earl?

802
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,040
Sticks?

803
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,840
Show your face, you chicken shit.

804
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,480
Yes.

805
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,000
I got you, you son of a bitch.

806
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,560
I got you!

807
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,960
Donny Boy,
it's going to be okay.

808
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,640
I'll get you out of here. Donny!

809
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,520
Get up!

810
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,840
Who are you?

811
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,560
You... you bastard!

812
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,320
You killed my brother!

813
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,640
You're going to die!

814
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,960
"Has this Hellspawn found some
scrap of humanity within himself?"

815
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,160
"Or is this the act of a predator
whose territory has been invaded?"

816
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,040
"Has his basic instinct to kill
taken hold of him?"

817
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,640
"He knows he has lost again".

818
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,440
"The real Victor here is the one...

819
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,920
who sent him to harvest more souls".

820
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,280
"The dream is always the same".

821
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,400
"We are pale riders in the night,
carrying the swords of justice...

822
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,160
as was done when men
first put on the hoods...

823
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,440
and set the cross on fire".

824
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,040
"For all to see and fear".

825
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,200
"One more of the outsiders
has been brought to justice".

826
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,040
"Those who have taken
our homes and jobs...

827
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,200
defiled our country".

828
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,760
"And our God".

829
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,280
"I know now
what the dream really means".

830
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:54,000
"I am to prepare the way
for the one who is coming".

831
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,200
"I see his face every night".

832
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,600
"We share the same dream".

833
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,040
"The master told me
what I had to do".

834
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,920
"He speaks to me
and I know his name".

835
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,520
"He calls himself Malebolgia".

836
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,480
Please, Sir, no smoking in cab.

837
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,600
- Please forgive me.
- No problem.

838
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,480
Where are you going tonight?

839
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,800
- I'm going to Brooklyn.
- Brooklyn, okay.

840
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,880
"I am the one to cleanse
and purify this city".

841
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,080
"To rid us of them".

842
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,240
"They're not like us, but they can't
really help themselves".

843
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,440
"They don't even know
why this must happen".

844
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,560
Please...

845
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,960
Why are you doing this?

846
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,880
I don't understand.

847
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,160
I'm sorry.

848
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,600
I know it is not your fault.

849
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,560
And it's really nothing personal.

850
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,160
"It is not just the lost
and dispossessed...

851
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,800
that have gathered
near the Hellspawn".

852
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,720
"There are those lone predators.

853
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,720
"The human monsters".

854
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,400
"Those who have heard
the voice of Malebolgia...

855
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,000
whispering to them".

856
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,880
"Evil has seeped
into their empty lives...

857
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,400
like a stained a liquid".

858
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,920
"Aware of the presence
of the Hellspawn...

859
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,120
they come to the alleys
to be near him".

860
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,640
"They are drawn to him".

861
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,640
"He is their Savior,
their link to the master".

862
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:20,520
"Hell has sent them
to be Malebolgia's hands".

863
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,600
"Covered with blood".

864
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,640
I've found you.

865
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,200
Get away from me.

866
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,520
Only makes it a business
to know where her husband is.

867
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,000
- She knows she's being watched.
- Why is this woman still alive?

868
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,120
Let me take her and the kid.

869
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,360
I'll know
where Fitzgerald is in an hour.

870
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,280
And if she really doesn't know,
you would have cut it to pieces.

871
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,160
I'll find him, don't worry.

872
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,200
Yes?

873
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,360
You wanted us to check in, sir?

874
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,800
Yes, Raymond what have you got?

875
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,560
She hasn't left her office all day.

876
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,640
She spoke with her grandmother
her daughter, several clients...

877
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,120
"and you".

878
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,800
She's clever, this one.

879
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,240
You know I'm good
in voice stress analysis.

880
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,560
Let me be there.
Next to you.

881
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,280
She's not a pro,
I know when she's lying.

882
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,880
If I feel like she's lying,
you can take her.

883
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,280
Ask her about her daughter,
is she missing a daddy.

884
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,080
A mother won't lie
about her kids feelings.

885
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,200
Wanda.

886
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,040
It's after 9PM,
why are you still here?

887
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,280
I've got some briefs to catch up on.

888
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,000
Honey, why don't you bother
legate the cases to somebody else?

889
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,280
At least til you hear about...

890
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,520
Terry.

891
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,760
Thanks, Lois,
but I have to stay busy...

892
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,240
or I lose my mind for sure.

893
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,160
Well Okay, see you tomorrow.

894
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,280
If you need anything,
let me know, okay?

895
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,720
Night

896
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,160
Good night, Lois.

897
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,040
- Wanda Blake.
- "Wanda". Jason Wynn.

898
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,120
- "Jason, anything new?"
- Yes, can you meet me for dinner?

899
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,760
Of course I can.

900
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,960
- Where do you want me to meet you?
- I'll send a car around...

901
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,520
to pick you up.

902
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,640
"All right".

903
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,600
- I'll be downstairs in 10 minutes.
- "See you then".

904
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,880
- You look exhausted.
- No sleep.

905
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,360
I have the same dreams every night.

906
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,640
"There's been a recent
string of disappearances...

907
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,320
all in the Brooklyn area".

908
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,280
"Police are investigating,
but there are no lead at this time...

909
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,240
and they're asking
for the public's help".

910
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,680
"The most recent disappearance
is local cab driver, Joseph Weiss".

911
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,800
"If you've seen this man
or have any information...

912
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,680
as to his work, please call
the number on the screen".

913
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,840
I didn't get the money again.

914
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,720
Yeah, I swear.

915
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,440
I swear I will never do it again.

916
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,600
Please, Baby, come get me.

917
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,680
Hey, what are you looking at?
fuck off!

918
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,360
Astoria Queens, please.

919
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,160
Astoria it is.

920
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,960
Thank you, Honey.
It's beautiful.

921
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,640
Surreal.

922
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,480
Happy Anniversary, Baby.

923
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,240
Hey, excuse me,
Astoria in Queens, not Brooklyn.

924
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,680
I'm sorry, the traffic
on the Triboro bridge...

925
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,080
What do we look like, tourists?

926
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,640
Stop the cab.

927
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,600
I said stop the cab right now
and let us out!

928
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,600
Hey, man look...

929
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,800
I only got 50 bucks,
it's yours, just...

930
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,960
Just let us out of here, okay?

931
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,040
I apologize,
but it has to be this way.

932
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,520
No.
Don't!

933
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,080
No, please, don't!

934
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,440
I really am sorry.

935
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,120
As his lawyer, I'd like to know
if my husband is...

936
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,760
being charged with a crime.

937
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,000
I think this can be resolved
in Terry's faith.

938
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,800
Don't get my hopes up, Jason.

939
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,680
Unless you are sure.

940
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,960
I'll always tell the truth, Wanda.

941
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,480
So How are you making out?
How's Cyan?

942
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,840
It's...

943
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,320
tough on the kid.

944
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,240
She cries for Terry every night
and I try to stay busy at work...

945
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,520
and...

946
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,840
try to keep myself together for her
but I do my own share of crying.

947
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,960
I'm sorry I didn't mean
to dump my problems on you.

948
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,440
It's all right, Wanda.

949
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,160
I know it's tough. But I'll be here
as long as you need me to be.

950
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,760
I just want Terry home.

951
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,120
So do I.

952
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,080
Is that him?

953
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,080
Is that the one you want?

954
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,800
- Problem?
- No.

955
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,840
I just have to make a call.

956
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,440
You can use my phone.

957
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,200
No thank you.
This is a private call.

958
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,720
I'll use one of the payphones.

959
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,200
Excuse me.

960
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,680
She's lying.

961
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,560
Wanda.

962
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,880
Terry, where are you?

963
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,880
Our old club in Brooklyn.

964
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,440
I can be there in 30 minutes.

965
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,480
I'll be waiting in front.

966
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,720
Terry...

967
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,800
I love you.

968
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,240
I love you too.

969
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,240
I'm sorry, Cyan's not feeling well.
I have to go.

970
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,800
I hope it's nothing serious.

971
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,680
She's been running a high fever.

972
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,680
Thank you for everything,
I'll take a cab.

973
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,560
No.
I won't adhere of it.

974
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:35,960
Merrick.

975
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,720
Will you see Miss Blake
to the car please?

976
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,760
- All right.
- No problem, Ma'am.

977
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,200
I'll call you, Jason.

978
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,800
Good night, Wanda.

979
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,320
Be careful.

980
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,920
Traced her call
to a payphone in Brooklyn.

981
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,360
Where is she now?

982
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,600
On the Manhattan Bridge,
heading into Brooklyn.

983
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,120
"Keep me posted".

984
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,080
You're awake, that's better.

985
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,880
Please forgive all this,

986
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,600
I really don't blame you.

987
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,080
And none of us chooses...

988
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,120
what we were born to be.

989
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,560
Yes?

990
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,480
Excellent. Brooklyn.

991
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,880
Interesting.

992
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,720
One of the Charles credit cards
were just traced in Brooklyn.

993
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,880
Son of a bitch has been
in our backyard all this time.

994
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,200
And Blake is on her way there now.

995
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,160
What?

996
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,440
"She keeps circling
the same couple of blocks".

997
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,000
Real slow.

998
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,400
"Pull her over until I get there".

999
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,280
No!

1000
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,200
Please step out of the car.

1001
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,720
What's this about?

1002
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,840
Please don't make this difficult.

1003
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,720
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Get out of the car.

1004
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,160
- No, I won't!
- Listen to me.

1005
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,680
You don't have a choice.

1006
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,360
What?
Go check it out.

1007
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,680
Please get out of the car, Miss.

1008
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,880
What?

1009
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,280
Hey, what?

1010
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,280
Yeah, nothing.

1011
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,920
Come on!

1012
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,240
God!

1013
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:29,240
God!
No!

1014
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,320
No!

1015
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,920
No!

1016
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,880
Come on!

1017
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,680
Come on!

1018
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,960
No!

1019
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,360
No!

1020
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:06,440
- Wanda...
- No!

1021
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,920
- Wanda.
- No, get away!

1022
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,600
Wanda!

1023
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:22,320
Wanda!

1024
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:32,480
No!

1025
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,080
I'm sorry, it took a bit longer
than I expected.

1026
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,400
No.

1027
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,560
This isn't supposed
to happen this way.

1028
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,600
I know you're here.

1029
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,920
There's no place to go.

1030
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,720
You fuck with the wrong guy.

1031
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,520
You sick little twerp!

1032
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,920
Come on, now.

1033
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,080
It's time to take your place
among the others.

1034
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,680
He told me it has to be this way.

1035
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,560
Does he think
he can fuck with me?

1036
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,360
With my plans?

1037
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:51,280
You would've killed her too
if you had the chance.

1038
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,480
Who's that?

1039
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,240
Who's there?

1040
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,320
I have a bad feeling about this.

1041
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:09,160
Where the hell
are Raymond and Watts?

1042
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,080
Do you see what I've done here?

1043
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:13,840
This was for the master,
I've saved them for you.

1044
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,760
I don't serve any master.

1045
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,440
Do you think our master
will be pleased?

1046
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,680
Why don't you ask him yourself?

1047
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,480
You're about to meet him.

1048
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,760
My dream...

1049
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,160
My savior.

1050
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,880
He betrayed me.

1051
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:28,440
Press is going to have
a field day with this.

1052
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:32,000
I counted there were 12 people
swinging from the rafters up there.

1053
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,480
One of them was a sick fuck
who did all the killing.

1054
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,200
It's like someone's
did us a favor.

1055
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,120
But who killed him?
He didn't hang himself.

1056
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,520
There's another cycle
running around out there.

1057
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,800
The City's going to hell.

1058
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,280
Triggers these guys anyway,
killing all those innocent people.

1059
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,040
Jesus.

1060
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:52,800
Two of the victims
were agents from the NSC.

1061
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,240
No wonder this place
is crawling with Feds.

1062
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,960
What the hell?

1063
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,360
Lady!
Let's get that car out of here!

1064
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:09,320
Okay, you're clear.
Back her up.

1065
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,480
Chief Banks, Wanda Blake
was the last person...

1066
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:20,960
...to see my agents alive.

1067
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,320
Find her,
Fitzgerald could be with her.

1068
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,080
My people are collecting the bodies.

1069
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:29,520
Now,
I want their identities withheld.

1070
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,280
As far as the press concerned,
they were never there.

1071
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,120
Two agents slaughtered
and put on display.

1072
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,880
Are you ready for this?

1073
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,280
He was there.

1074
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,680
Fitzgerald couldn't have done
all that alone.

1075
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,600
Of course he couldn't.

1076
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,600
This is getting too strange
and costly.

1077
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,240
That DC game
you're playing was beautiful, Baby.

1078
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,520
That was pretty.

1079
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,360
- Shit!
- Look out!

1080
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,720
Goddamn lady!

1081
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,600
Damn, Lady!
where'd you learn how to drive?

1082
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,480
About kill me and shit.

1083
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,360
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we all right.

1084
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:39,120
May I see
a driver's license and registration.

1085
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:41,640
Raymond and Watts
were torn apart...

1086
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,960
and then dragged up
seven flights of stairs.

1087
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,120
There's a second killer.

1088
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,080
- Wynn.
- "It's Banks".

1089
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,560
"One of my cops
just pulled over Wanda Blake".

1090
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,400
- "She's a few blocks from you".
- Where's Fitzgerald?

1091
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,720
"No sign of him.
What do we do with her?"

1092
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,280
Do not detain her.

1093
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,840
Fitzgerald must still be
in the area.

1094
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,320
Find him now..

1095
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,280
You know, Jason.

1096
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,320
Someone's out there.

1097
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:13,160
You must have friends
in pretty high places, Miss Blake.

1098
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,680
What?

1099
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,640
Go home, Ma'am.

1100
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,480
And try not to kill anyone
getting there, okay?

1101
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,920
She was afraid of me.

1102
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,440
Who are you believing?

1103
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,440
Her, yourself?

1104
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,560
You cannot have that life back.

1105
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,240
When Al Simmons died...

1106
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:48,640
all hopes of a future
with Wanda died with him.

1107
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:51,920
You have been born
into another existence.

1108
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,320
A chance to regain your humanity.

1109
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,600
It's there and only there
where your choices lie.

1110
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:04,000
She's seen the creature I've become.

1111
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,040
That's all she knows.

1112
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:07,840
Her only memory of me.

1113
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:16,680
This is truly what hell is,
old man.

1114
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,320
- You have a chance to...
- A chance?

1115
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,000
What chance?

1116
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,480
I have nothing here anymore!

1117
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,720
No escape, not even death!

1118
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:40,000
You see?
I can't even end it.

1119
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,200
I would trade anything...

1120
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,240
do my life over again
in the world's worst shithole...

1121
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:55,920
than to be here, now, like this!

1122
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:00,600
I know what you're going through.

1123
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,520
The pain that you feel.

1124
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,200
How could you possibly know,
old man?

1125
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:09,200
Because I have endured it
and survived.

1126
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,560
Do you think your fate is sealed?

1127
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:15,440
Are you going to accept the shroud
that's been placed around you?

1128
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,360
I can't go on like this anymore.

1129
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,000
Hiding in the shadows...

1130
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,880
I'm sick of it.

1131
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:24,440
I have to let her know...

1132
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,920
who I am.

1133
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,680
How can you tell her that...

1134
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,040
when you don't even know yourself.

1135
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:44,120
Tomorrow's headlines
will be traitor shoot wife and child.

1136
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,400
After all, he was distraught.

1137
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,160
- You have Fitzgerald's gun?
- Yes and his prints too.

1138
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,680
Banks has every cop in Brooklyn
looking for Fitzgerald.

1139
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:55,880
- We should have him by morning.
- I'd like to finish this...

1140
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,800
myself.

1141
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:00,880
Use an independent contractor,
someone outside the agency.

1142
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,040
Jason, I said I'll do it.

1143
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:07,560
No, my best agents
are coming back in body bags.

1144
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:10,200
Someone is out there
and they're getting closer.

1145
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:13,280
I want you to find them, Merrick,
before they find me.

1146
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,440
You look spooked.

1147
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,680
Won't let anything happen to you.

1148
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,160
Here we go.

1149
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,400
Please, Miss Wu.

1150
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,680
Some of us
would like to go home.

1151
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,480
I'm almost done.

1152
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,320
Last time I do you a favor,
goddamnit.

1153
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:27,760
Interesting.

1154
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,480
I think it's time
I had a talk with Wanda Blake.

1155
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,000
The scene in Brooklyn
is pretty grim.

1156
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,320
We have another monsters handiwork
to sort out.

1157
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:40,960
Media's gone apeshit.
And the politics on this one...

1158
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,240
gentlemen, the politics are heavy.

1159
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:47,680
So bag and tag everything,
by the book.

1160
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,280
Make a note of everything
that doesn't belong there.

1161
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,760
We are working
two major crime scenes.

1162
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:57,840
We have some badly decomposed bodies
in the alleys off 42nd Street.

1163
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,920
My guess, the missing drug dealers.

1164
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,840
All right,
go be New York's finest.

1165
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,240
- Let's get this done.
- Let's get this guy.

1166
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,640
You know, to each of those ten
represents a body...

1167
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,600
found in that alley.

1168
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,960
You know what pisses me off,
this has to happen in our precinct.

1169
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,680
I absolutely agree, Sir.

1170
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,480
About fucking time
to go into those alleys.

1171
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:19,960
I know something's in there.
How many reports do we have...

1172
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,320
to write, Twitch?

1173
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,880
Too many, Sir.
I'm sure the locals...

1174
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,920
will appreciate their concern.

1175
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,880
Place is a ghost town.

1176
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:31,480
You see all those body bags?

1177
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,120
This Alley and the guns going off...

1178
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,840
Please, Honey.

1179
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,560
Where are you?

1180
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,280
Wanda.

1181
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:06,080
Hey, you, over there.

1182
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:09,080
Yes, officer, is there a problem?

1183
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:10,760
Can I help you?

1184
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,760
- What are you doing out here?
- I was looking for a phone.

1185
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,240
- Call my wife.
- He fits the description.

1186
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:18,040
This could be our guy, be careful.

1187
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,440
Could you stop showing the light
on my face, please?

1188
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:23,600
Excuse me.

1189
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,320
Could you get
that light out of my eyes?

1190
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,800
Can you tell me where
there's a phone? I just can't...

1191
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,600
seem to find one that works?

1192
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:30,360
What happened to your clothes?

1193
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:33,200
You've been fighting?
You've been drinking?

1194
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,360
Is there a law
against having a drink?

1195
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,960
- I'm not driving.
- Sir.

1196
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:43,200
You see anything unusual
in the last couple of hours or so?

1197
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,720
Unusual?

1198
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,240
What do you mean by unusual?

1199
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,560
Hear any loud noises,
screams, shots...

1200
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,720
anything out of the ordinary?

1201
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:54,240
No, otherwise
I would've called the cops.

1202
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,200
May I see some ID, Sir?

1203
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,960
ID?

1204
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,320
Yeah, sure.

1205
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,080
Right here, Man,
I seem to lost my wallet.

1206
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,000
We're going to have to ask you
to come with us.

1207
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,160
I haven't broken any laws.

1208
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,800
Just come with us, please.

1209
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,440
What for? I'm telling you
I need to call my wife

1210
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:17,000
She'll come get me.
I haven't done anything.

1211
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,800
- I was at a bar.
- What bar, where?

1212
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,520
Is that we had the fight?

1213
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,920
No.

1214
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,560
I just need to call my wife!

1215
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:28,360
Lie down on the street, right now!

1216
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,040
Hands out, at your side, now.

1217
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,720
"Hello, this is Lisa.
Sorry I can't take your call".

1218
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,280
"But leave me a message
and I'll call you back...

1219
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,720
as soon as I can".

1220
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,000
"Lisa, I know you're there, pick up".

1221
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:11,920
"I'm so used to talking
to this damn thing anyway".

1222
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,440
"Okay".

1223
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,920
"I want you to join the circus".

1224
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,440
"This Brooklyn serial killer's story
is going to sell a ton of papers".

1225
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,360
"I mean, this guy was strung up
next to his victims".

1226
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,240
"There's my front-page".

1227
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:27,240
"Stop covering dead-end alley story".

1228
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,720
"Switch all your attention
over to this".

1229
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,960
I'm hunting another monster.

1230
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:38,280
"By the way, I got your compensation
for the deepthroat...

1231
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:41,200
you're working with in NSC".

1232
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,040
"Someday you're going to have
to let me know who it is".

1233
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,000
"Must be somebody pretty high up".

1234
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,720
- Let's go, move it.
- The civilian's out.

1235
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,680
Set up a perimeter.

1236
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,240
- Okay.
- And do it now.

1237
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,440
Step back, there's nothing
to look at here, Sir.

1238
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,280
Where do you think you're going?

1239
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:07,400
It was nothing to look at here.
Move it another block.

1240
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:13,360
Excuse me, Miss,
I can't let you do that.

1241
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,400
But what are they looking for?

1242
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:18,360
I can't tell you that.
Now move along please if you would.

1243
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,760
Thanks for the help.

1244
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:25,440
Maybe the locals know something.

1245
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,480
Okay, what's up with the guys
in the moon suits?

1246
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:50,040
Looks like they're invading
these alleys of yours.

1247
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,960
What do you think they're looking?

1248
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,800
They're cleaning up the trash
that tried to fuck with us.

1249
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:00,080
We took care of business
because this is our home.

1250
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:02,000
- Shut up, Bobby.
- I'm a reporter...

1251
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,480
for The Washington Post.

1252
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,520
I could sure you
use the lead on the story.

1253
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:09,960
Looking to have a party, Lady?
I got some stories for you.

1254
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:11,920
Do you do know anything
about all the murders...

1255
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,200
happening in these alleys?

1256
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,120
You must've seen something.

1257
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,840
It's kind of strange
how they all occurred...

1258
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,400
in the last several months.

1259
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,600
They're all connected
as my feeling.

1260
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:25,040
Come on, I'll show you something
that you're going to like.

1261
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,320
Bobby, what are you doing?

1262
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,160
I wish you keep
your big mouth shut.

1263
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,520
Good night, sweetheart.

1264
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,120
Terry.

1265
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,800
Where are you?

1266
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,520
Hello?

1267
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,720
Good evening, Wanda.
It's Jason Wynn.

1268
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,400
Any word from Terry?

1269
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,200
No, no

1270
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,960
Nothing.

1271
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,960
Have you been watching the news?

1272
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,800
Yes

1273
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,440
They say that there's
another killer out there.

1274
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,560
Yes, it seems that this city has
become an even more...

1275
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,200
dangerous place to live.

1276
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:41,280
By the way, I'm posting someone
outside your house...

1277
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,080
to watch over you.

1278
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,680
"Thank you, Jason".

1279
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,760
I'll call to check on you
in the morning.

1280
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,480
Maybe tonight you can finally
get some sleep.

1281
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,920
Good night.

1282
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,840
That's a hell of a story.

1283
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,320
But I'm not buying it.

1284
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,400
Show her, Gareb.

1285
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,720
Be glad to get
this thing out of the alleys.

1286
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,600
You weren't kidding.

1287
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,880
Where did you get this?

1288
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,680
Take it. Maybe without them...

1289
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:25,040
there'll be less people getting hurt.

1290
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:28,800
This must be the missing weapons
that my source was talking about.

1291
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,400
Are there anymore?

1292
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,120
There's more hidden around here too.

1293
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,080
I'll show you.

1294
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:37,240
Well...

1295
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:40,400
why don't you tell me more
about this Al guy.

1296
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,760
"But it's most important feature,
it works, it burns fat".

1297
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,760
"You trim inches off your waist
and those pesky saddlebags...

1298
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,600
with these pair of legs".

1299
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:50,240
"The Flex Flat brought here to help".

1300
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,560
"And just in weeks,
you're going to notice a difference".

1301
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,200
Wanda.

1302
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:21,760
I just want to talk to you, please.

1303
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:28,000
I will never hurt you.

1304
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:29,840
I only want to protect you.

1305
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:32,960
Please!

1306
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:36,000
- I need help!
- Wanda, it's me.

1307
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,800
It's me, Wanda.

1308
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,920
- Listen to my voice.
- No.

1309
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,440
I'm your husband.

1310
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,080
You're lying to me!

1311
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,440
You're that monster.

1312
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,880
Why are you making my mommy cry?

1313
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,960
Please don't hurt my baby!

1314
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,320
Please don't hurt my baby!

1315
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,160
Please...

1316
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,040
Leave her alone.

1317
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:27,240
Don't cry, Mommy.

1318
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,560
He won't hurt you.

1319
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,440
That was The Sad Man.

1320
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,520
What?

1321
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,960
You know.

1322
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,880
The Sad Man.

1323
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:50,120
He saved me.

1324
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,160
"The dreams keep coming".

1325
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:10,360
"I can't seem to stop them
to shut them out".

1326
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,760
"In the dreams,
I see a second real world...

1327
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:15,360
where the dead appeared in me".

1328
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,840
"Now I know that the dead live on".

1329
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:23,200
"I'm connected now to this killer,
he's just a cypher".

1330
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:26,640
"I'm connected to the one
who sent the killer".

1331
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:31,120
"I have felt a presence of evil
and find comfort in its familiarity".

1332
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:36,640
"It's been guiding me all along,
and will help me change the world".

1333
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:39,920
Merrick.

1334
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,400
"Yes, Jason".

1335
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:43,200
Step in here for a moment

1336
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,920
"I'm on my way".

1337
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:55,280
Merrick?

1338
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:59,000
Merrick, that you?

1339
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:12,040
All right, step out slowly.

1340
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:21,560
I've come to take you to hell.

1341
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,680
Who the fuck are you?

1342
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:34,360
You take such pleasure
in destroying lives.

1343
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:36,560
Hell has been waiting for you.

1344
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,840
You're the one in my dreams.

1345
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,680
Can you smell it?

1346
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,000
The smell of burning flesh.

1347
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,840
What are your sins, Jason Wynn?

1348
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,320
Are you ready for Judgement Day?

1349
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,600
Jason.

1350
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:45,000
Something's wrong,
I can hear it in your voice.

1351
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,720
No, nothing.

1352
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,880
You retreat here,
hiding in the shadows of...

1353
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,680
this alley because you don't want
to face the truth.

1354
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:14,920
The truth of your existence.

1355
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,320
You made the deal with Malebolgia.

1356
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,280
I came back for her.

1357
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:22,920
But she sees what a monster I am.

1358
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,920
I can't let that be the end of us.

1359
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,120
You'll only bring her more pain.
Let her go.

1360
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:31,480
I can't. I've to protect her
from Jason Wynn.

1361
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:34,160
You were brought this evil
into her life.

1362
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:37,080
The stink of hell
you've brought back from your master.

1363
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:38,720
- Master?
- Who do you think wrapped you...

1364
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,520
you in that shroud?
It was Malebolgia.

1365
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:44,760
Are you going to send him
the dark soul Jason Wynn...

1366
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,280
Wynn had me murdered.

1367
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:47,920
He'll kill Wanda too
if I don't stop him.

1368
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,360
Your life and Jason Wynn's life
have always been entwined.

1369
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:55,440
Malebolgia has been
guiding both of you.

1370
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,400
- You are blood brothers.
- Who are you?

1371
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,560
How do you know these things?

1372
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:05,080
Because he was once my master too.

1373
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:08,320
Listen to me, Hellspawn,
I'm your only hope.

1374
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:12,320
Maybe you were sent by him
to confuse me.

1375
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:14,400
I will protect my wife.

1376
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:18,560
How are you going to do that?
By killing Jason Wynn?

1377
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:20,000
That's what your master wants.

1378
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,960
If you send his soul to Hell,
he'll come back...

1379
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,520
as powerful as you are.

1380
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:29,640
I can show you
how to break the curse.

1381
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:33,520
But you have to stop
the savage killing.

1382
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:36,560
Wynn is going to die.

1383
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:38,600
And to hell with him!

1384
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:42,880
"Tomorrow, an exclusive
Washington Post's story...

1385
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:45,920
will report an allegation
of an NSC cover-up regarding...

1386
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,800
a disappearances of a large supply
of new generation of weapons".

1387
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:53,920
"The article states that the weapons
were stolen several months ago...

1388
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,600
from NSC's
highest security compound".

1389
02:02:56,680 --> 02:03:00,280
"Sources from inside the NSC
alleges that its top officials...

1390
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:03,120
may have concealed knowledge
of the theft".

1391
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,320
"The Attorney General's office...

1392
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:07,920
He's planning a complete
investigation.

1393
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,200
Do we have our contingency plan,
Mr. Wynn?

1394
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:16,240
Now that power comes to press,
time to collect it at their back.

1395
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:19,760
Wynn?

1396
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:22,800
Maybe it's time you made me friends.

1397
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:24,920
That makes you the man
with the master plan.

1398
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,640
- Merrick!
- Those steaming inside you...

1399
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:29,000
waiting to get out!

1400
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:30,800
Yes, Jason, what's wrong?

1401
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,440
Did you see that?

1402
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,480
On the TV.

1403
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,160
"The NSC has refused to comment".

1404
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,760
I have a legal right
to make a phone call.

1405
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:43,560
You haven't charged me
with anything, have you?

1406
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:46,120
I haven't heard anyone
reading my rights.

1407
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,200
- So I'm not playing your game.
- Your prints are all over...

1408
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:50,520
that crime scene.
Your life is over.

1409
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:57,320
Had to cut that short,
Burke and Twitch came...

1410
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,600
into the observation room
you know what a tight-assed...

1411
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,920
Twitch is about procedures.

1412
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,640
- That guy's cool under pressure.
- I still unclear why Chief Banks...

1413
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:05,880
didn't allow us
to question the suspect.

1414
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:08,000
Because I think that guys are Fed.

1415
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:10,920
There were two NSC agents
hanging by their necks from rafters.

1416
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,040
- The whole thing stinks.
- Excuse me...

1417
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:14,320
Detective Burke and Williams.

1418
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,560
I'm Lisa Wu, Washington Post.

1419
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,120
You're investigating
the murders committed...

1420
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,440
in the alleys off 42nd.

1421
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,360
No comment, Lady.
I never talked to the press...

1422
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:24,280
unless I'm getting the score
on a Yankee game.

1423
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:28,080
But the coroner says that
most of the victims were strangled.

1424
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:30,240
Necks, backs broken.

1425
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:33,840
But there were three victims who died
strictly from gunshot wounds.

1426
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,600
I'm assuming you have some leads
on the possible suspect.

1427
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:41,360
Have you found the guns
used in the murders?

1428
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:44,360
Twitch, do you know?

1429
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:46,800
My memories fading, sir.

1430
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,640
I've been asking around
about you guys.

1431
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:52,640
Word is that you're both
straight arrow cops and I like that.

1432
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:56,160
Your job is to find the truth,
my job is to report it.

1433
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:58,520
I admire your persistence.

1434
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:02,520
I've a feeling that there are truths
that you know...

1435
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:04,360
that may be helpful to us.

1436
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,240
Tell me
about the Fed you're holding...

1437
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,760
and I'll show you
the murder weapons.

1438
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:10,280
Step into the my office.

1439
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:14,280
That was very nicely done, Miss Wu.

1440
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,760
I mean Hellspawn,
you're fucking things up.

1441
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,320
You're pissing the man off.

1442
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:29,920
The last man I saw him pissed off,
he liquidate them.

1443
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,280
Nothing can be looking like this.

1444
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:34,720
I'm a god!
Disgusting fucking little paws.

1445
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,560
- It suits you.
- I can forget about getting laid.

1446
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,840
I've seen the way people look at me.

1447
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,360
But enough about me.

1448
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:45,400
You have to take out our enemies.
That would be Jason Wynn.

1449
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:47,320
Sooner or later,
you're not going to be any worth...

1450
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,960
to your pretty wife.

1451
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:58,400
NSC headquarters.

1452
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:02,040
"All visitors must check in
and receive clearance for entry".

1453
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:05,280
Lisa Wu. I'm here to speak
with the director, Jason Wynn.

1454
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:08,360
I'm sorry, Miss Wu,
as I told you on the phone...

1455
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:10,320
we're not making any statements
to the press.

1456
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,400
Well, I'm going to hold
a press conference tomorrow...

1457
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,040
and placed a stolen NSC weapons
on a table...

1458
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:17,200
in front of the television cameras.

1459
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:20,120
The NYPD will be there to confirm
that these weapons were used...

1460
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:22,600
in some of the recent
alley murders.

1461
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:25,360
I'm just here to ask Mr. Wynn
if he'd like to be there.

1462
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,680
He's invited.

1463
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:29,840
Wanda Blake is still alive.

1464
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:32,120
They found
your independent contractor...

1465
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:35,080
washed up on the shore.
Torn apart like the other.

1466
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,080
Excuse me, waiter.
Can I have a bottle?

1467
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:41,360
Thanks.

1468
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:46,880
His car was still parked
in front of her house.

1469
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:51,000
Did you invite me to dinner
just to fire me, Jason?

1470
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:55,960
The killer is
still out there, Merrick.

1471
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:58,200
You know who it is, don't you?

1472
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:01,360
I've been having dreams,
they started when the killing began.

1473
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,520
There's a strange familiarity
about it all.

1474
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:08,320
It is really fucking with me,
Merrick.

1475
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,040
Playing with my head.

1476
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:20,760
Wynn.

1477
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:23,360
The Washington Post?
What does she want?

1478
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:27,160
You are supposed
to deal with the press.

1479
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:30,880
What the hell
do I pay you for anyway?

1480
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:33,640
I never wanted anyone
giving anything to the press.

1481
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:35,200
Understood?

1482
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:41,640
A reporter.

1483
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:44,520
- Yes.
- What's the name?

1484
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:46,200
Miss Blake, Lisa Wu.

1485
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:49,000
Thanks for seeing me
so early in the morning.

1486
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,200
Please, come in.

1487
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:56,800
Hey there.

1488
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:03,720
"This is what I know. A man matching
your husband's description...

1489
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:06,400
is being held at the 87th precinct".

1490
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,120
They're trying to tie him
to the Brooklyn serial murders.

1491
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,840
I'm really very sorry.

1492
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,920
"Look, Miss Wu.
I checked the police stations..."

1493
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,520
hospitals, and morgues.

1494
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,360
"No sign of Terry.
How do I know you're not lying?"

1495
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,600
"Did you actually see Terry?"

1496
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:24,880
Miss Blake, I know it's Terry.

1497
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:26,280
The only way
to get him off the hook...

1498
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:29,200
would be to put pressure
on the guy who framed him.

1499
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,160
"And that's Jason Wynn".

1500
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,560
We're stepping out now.
The reporter is in the front.

1501
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:42,400
Take the shots
when they become available.

1502
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,560
The reporter first.
And then Blake.

1503
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,440
Stiles. Take your shot.

1504
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,560
Stiles?

1505
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:44,640
"Someone talk to me".

1506
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:47,680
"Stiles. Diego.
What the hell is going on?"

1507
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,360
"Are you out there?"

1508
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,040
"Someone talk to me".

1509
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:00,360
I'm coming for you, Jason Wynn.

1510
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:08,760
"I'm coming for you, Jason Wynn".

1511
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,560
That voice.

1512
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:15,080
It was in my dream.

1513
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:17,000
Two more slaughtered.

1514
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:18,880
This is just what I want him to do.

1515
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,400
He'll come to me
and then we'll have him.

1516
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:26,320
Level-4 counter-terrorists maneuver?
What are we looking for?

1517
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:29,160
- No one is talking.
- Probably another live exercise.

1518
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:35,120
I didn't pick up
anything over the wires...

1519
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:36,800
- I don't like it.
- You don't have to like it...

1520
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,480
you just have to do what I say.

1521
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:42,000
"This could be prom night, Boys".

1522
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:44,160
"Preamp spec war strikes,
so listen up".

1523
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:47,400
"From this moment on, I am
the voice of God in your headsets...

1524
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:49,720
...for the outside theme.
I want our snipers...

1525
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:52,440
on all surrounding buildings,
civilians have been evacuated".

1526
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:53,920
"Only kill shots".

1527
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:02,640
The choppers on the roof waiting.
Surveillance equipment is online.

1528
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:05,680
Jason, my men want to know
what we're dealing with.

1529
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,280
Let him back us in.

1530
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:09,240
And then we'll strike.

1531
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,640
We can see everything from here.

1532
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:13,320
We're ready for him.

1533
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:20,560
Command to chopper,
anything to report?

1534
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,320
I don't get it,
no briefing, nothing.

1535
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,800
It's bullshit.
I want to get some real action.

1536
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:30,760
Got men down here.

1537
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,600
"What the hell is going on?"

1538
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:53,880
"The place is in lockdown
who gave that order?"

1539
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:55,360
"Shit, stop the door!"

1540
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:00,040
- Over here, now!
- What the hell is going on?

1541
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,640
Get these doors open, now!

1542
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:09,000
- Great! Hey!
- What's going on?

1543
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:16,360
Clever.
He's taking out our system.

1544
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:21,880
He's shutting us down.

1545
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:26,040
I need you down there now.

1546
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,800
All teams check in
every two minutes.

1547
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,720
- Status on power?
- They're working on it.

1548
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,360
Nelson, status from the outside team?

1549
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,800
Nelson?

1550
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:49,800
Jesus.

1551
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:53,160
Agent down, need communication
with outside team.

1552
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:55,520
"We have an intruder".

1553
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,160
Let's go.

1554
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:23,880
"Find a way into this
goddamn building now".

1555
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,320
This one's locked too.

1556
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,520
Shit, get out of the way!
I got it.

1557
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,640
Hold your fire!

1558
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,360
Something is in there.

1559
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:25,240
All right, let's move out.
Come on!

1560
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:31,760
We'll gas the fucker out.
Shoot when the target's clear.

1561
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:34,280
What is the target, Merrick?
I haven't seen anything.

1562
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:36,440
We're shooting at shadows,
what the hell is going on?

1563
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:38,160
Just follow my lead.

1564
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:19,040
What is it?

1565
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:44,840
Get me back up.

1566
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:48,080
I need a team up here.
Wynn's office, now!

1567
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:31,280
There you are,
I've been waiting for you.

1568
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:36,000
- Who are you?
- Don't you remember me?

1569
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,720
You had me burned alive.

1570
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:41,080
What?

1571
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,960
Simmons?

1572
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:46,040
Simmons is dead.

1573
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:48,080
No shit.

1574
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:50,120
I don't believe you!

1575
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:00,680
Do it.

1576
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:02,360
Kill me.

1577
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:07,360
"If you send in his soul to Hell,
he'll come back...

1578
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:09,440
as powerful as you are".

1579
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,440
In there.

1580
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:23,400
Fitzgerald and my wife...

1581
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:26,240
you'll never
endanger their lives again.

1582
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:39,080
Get out of here.

1583
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,280
Get me...

1584
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:59,000
Chief Banks.

1585
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:07,200
Hey, Dorsey, that guy your holding.

1586
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,480
We ran his prints,
we got a call from the Feds.

1587
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:11,120
We're instructed
to cut him loose.

1588
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:13,920
Cut him loose? What for?
That's the guy for sure...

1589
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,160
and you and I both know that.

1590
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,960
Order came down
from Chief Banks himself.

1591
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:21,600
Bring him up.
Let him go home.

1592
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:24,240
I don't like it either,
but that's what we have to do.

1593
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:26,560
It's bullshit, can't be true.

1594
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:29,880
You heard me. Look, there's nothing
we can do about it.

1595
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:34,440
Just keep it on the QT,
give him the goddamn telephone call.

1596
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:53,560
Show your face.
Do as I say.

1597
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,880
Hello, Jason Wynn.

1598
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:05,240
I believe it's time
I made your acquaintance.

1599
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:28,840
Hello.

1600
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:30,720
Hi, it's me baby.

1601
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:34,480
God, where are you?
Are you all right?

1602
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:39,600
I'm okay. I'm fine.

1603
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:41,880
Can I come home?

1604
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:45,400
Come home.

1605
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:48,480
Come home.
