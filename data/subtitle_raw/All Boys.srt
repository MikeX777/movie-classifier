1
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:55,960
A home we didn't have any porn
and I never noticed any

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,080
but of course between the age of 6 and 7,
I started to browse my father's library

3
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,400
where I found a wonderful picture book
about Africa

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,200
which was about pictures of people,
many of them in the nude.

5
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,560
It was totally fascinating to me
and I thought it was great.

6
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,240
I memorized the pictures
because the book had to stay in the book shelve.

7
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,560
But I memorized the pictures
and then I went to my room. Sure!

8
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,640
I remembered them
and I got intoxicated with their beauty. 

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,080
A bit later, when I was 11 or 12,
I saw real porn magazines

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,600
and I didn't dare bring them home.

11
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,880
But of course I looked at them with my friends
and we'd jerk each other off.

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,760
I asked him how he ended up
in the porn business

13
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,800
and he answered that Disney wouldn't 
be happy to hear that

14
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,560
but after doing Disney On Ice for 6 years,

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,960
it was time for him to do something new.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,560
So he thought 'Why not porn?'

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,800
and he got in touch with John Rutherford,
the president of Colt Studios,

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,640
who offered him a contract very quickly.

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,000
Even though I'm a political activist,
I don't have a problem with gay porn.

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,640
My question always is:
Under what circumstance were these films made?

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,520
Did the models decide to do it voluntarily?

22
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,360
Do they do it out of their own free will
and because they have fun doing them?

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,800
Then it's porn I can enjoy.

24
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,520
Are you models or are you distributors?

25
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,960
You're ... a fast train.

26
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
Sorry!

27
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,080
Do you take part in the movies?

28
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:13,480
Yeah, ... but ... no longer.

29
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,160
On DVD.
- You sell them? You sell DVDs?

30
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah.

31
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,980
They asked us
if we take part in the movies

32
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,100
and they wanted to take pictures of us.

33
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,120
Of course they were welcome to take pictures.
After all, we're representating our movies.

34
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,189
'An erotic fair -
a house full of cocks!'

35
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,810
That's funny!

36
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,550
I found this job offer on the internet,

37
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,350
so I applied.

38
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,209
I wanted a regular job

39
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,089
and I ended up in Prague.

40
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,379
I definitely don't want to be
a model anymore.

41
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,750
No way.

42
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,409
Great, and now get it up once more!

43
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:44,779
Wait.

44
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,730
Your next movies is going to be called
Bareback Bowling Bonanza.

45
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,820
It's going to come across like a party

46
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,950
Where are we gonna shoot?
- At a bowling alley.

47
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,970
You're gonna be bowling and partying.

48
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,950
That's gonna be fun.

49
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,679
And of course we'll also shoot at Dan's.

50
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,200
How many scene am I gonna have?

51
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,929
Just one but it's big one.
- At the bowling alley.

52
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,110
And what am I gonna do?

53
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,340
How about if I'd ...

54
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,950
I'd better not say it out loud.

55
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,049
Anyways, I'm not gay.

56
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,250
I don't wanna have my hair cut.

57
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,710
But you look really great
in this magazine.

58
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,419
And on that poster.

59
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,919
I like this one especially well.

60
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,570
Cause I'm the only one on it.

61
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,549
It's more professional than porn.

62
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,490
Yeah, it looks great.

63
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,570
I don't get it.

64
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
How many magazines does Dan owe?

65
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,730
Just one.

66
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,090
Every month there's a picture
of a Czech boy.

67
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,250
Or one from Russia, Latvia or Estonia.

68
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,389
Okay, great.

69
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,179
Sorry, Friday.
I'm at the office.

70
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,909
Bye!

71
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,919
Are they any good?
- Yeah, they're fine.

72
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,179
My name is Ruda Prochazka.

73
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,820
I was born on April 22nd, 1985.

74
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,049
I'm 22 years old

75
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,279
and I grew up in a children's home.

76
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,840
I don't wanna talk about my family.

77
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,389
I have a brother and a sister.

78
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,980
Did you ever meet with them again?
- No, they're living at the children's home.

79
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,470
What would you do
if you had a lot of money?

80
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,830
Save it and start an normal life,
without Dan.

81
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,450
You'll lean on the box.

82
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,379
Action!

83
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm a big star in the US.

84
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
If they gave me more money,
I wouldn't have to work as hard.

85
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,919
I know that I'm a star over there.

86
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,980
Here at least I act like one.

87
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,419
I mean, like a star,
not like someone who's gay!

88
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,630
I wear these fancy clothes
and I show them off on the streets.

89
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,819
And everybody's like 'Wow'!

90
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,079
Dan has the best clothes.

91
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,180
He's got really good taste
the bastard.

92
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,069
 I always wore great clothes.
Even the Americans stare at me.

93
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,109
Are you recording this?

94
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,549
I don't wanna work in construction.
I used to be a bricklayer.

95
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,619
But I hate that job.

96
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,609
Take my card. When you see a young guy
at a shoot,

97
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
you'll get a commission.

98
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,220
You get 1,000 for a regular-looking boy,

99
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,670
and more,
if he's really good-looking.

100
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,059
If we contract him,
you'll get 5,000 crowns.

101
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:55,200
75 kilos ...  when I look at you,
I'd say it's more like over 80.

102
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,359
Please stand up and undress yourself.

103
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,599
How long is it when it's hard?
- 7 inches.

104
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,390
Could you give me your phone number?

105
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,250
731...

106
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,319
Tell me when you get a new number.

107
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,849
How about the socks?
- You can keep them on.

108
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,670
I think yours is bigger than 7 inches.

109
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,759
Can you get it hard?
Are you nervous?

110
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,400
Right now?

111
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,220
Please turn around.
I'd like to see your ass.

112
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,259
Do you shave it?

113
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,710
Great.

114
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,009
I'd like to see an erection now.
I'm gonna get you a couple of magazines.

115
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,069
Would you like the film crew to leave
while you get ready?

116
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,400
Just an erection?

117
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,430
Yeah, just an erection.
Don't ejaculate.

118
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,019
I wanna see the ejaculation live.
- Okay, I'll give it a try.

119
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,609
You can sit down.
A magazine with pics?

120
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:32,349
That would be better.

121
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,950
Please stand up again,
right where you're now!

122
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,630
For smaller projects we pay
5,000 crowns per scene.

123
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,559
The boys get to decide
if they want to do smaller projects.

124
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,359
Would you be interested in that
or are you more into the bigger projects?

125
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,529
Hey, how did it go yesterday?

126
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,710
Pretty badly.
I was so damn tired.

127
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,089
I'm an old hand here
because I've been in the business for 6 years now.

128
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,460
People wanna see new meat,
new contacts.

129
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,450
You get around 90,000 crowns,
expenses included.

130
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,859
90,000 for expenses?

131
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:01,309
No, it's 90,000 plus the gym,
tanning and hormones.

132
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,220
I've gotta be available all the time.

133
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,099
When they call you,
you've gotta be there in 2 days time.

134
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,509
Australia, Greece or Italy,

135
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,329
if you're not there within 2 days,

136
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,690
you've gotta pay 100,000
for breach of contract.

137
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,890
Just try coming up with 100,000!

138
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:31,160
You have to sign the contract
before you start shooting,

139
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,750
not afterwards.

140
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,869
When you sign,
you agree to the fines.

141
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,000
But he said I needn't worry about that.

142
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,460
Hi!
- How are you?

143
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,460
Fine. Hello!

144
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,089
I don't know anything about computers.

145
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,849
Young people can find a job
at an office.

146
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,809
But not me.

147
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,430
You need connections.
- I probably wouldn't even like it.

148
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,680
You wouldn't?
- Nope.

149
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,740
I'd like a job at an office.
A friend of mine said he'd help me with that.

150
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,609
Even when I was a child,
we were poor.

151
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,230
Later I understood
that we couldn't afford certain things

152
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,240
that others could.

153
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:38,170
Other kids could go on trips,
go hiking or skiing.

154
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,430
We couldn't afford to do that.

155
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,779
'Bareback' is very popular right now

156
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,940
so I've gotta do it too.

157
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:48,430
It's my job,
that's how I earn a living.

158
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,170
So I follow the trend.

159
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,960
I always have their health
at the back of my mind.

160
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,059
After all, I have a family too.

161
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,880
I insist on good hygiene.

162
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,150
Your signature and the money
if you're interested.

163
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,539
If you aren't, no worries.

164
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,210
In the future,
more and more movies will be made,

165
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,279
resulting in falling prices.

166
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,569
But there'll always be some people
who'll do it for less.

167
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,199
These old Greeks don't even know
how to do it right.

168
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,429
If you deep-throat Jyrka,
you'll get an extra 1,000.

169
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,579
There are these injections
which will give you a hard-on.

170
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,150
I never had any problems
getting it up.

171
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,610
I take a Viagra and that's it.

172
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,190
Then I'm in ecstasy 
because I'll be hard for hours .

173
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,929
The whole time.

174
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
I was dating Dan.

175
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,730
By now I've forgotten it all.

176
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,739
He wasn't a bad person

177
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,369
but he always acted so gay.

178
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,210
I asked him
if he couldn't act more normal.

179
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,380
But his position made him king.

180
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,150
He could tell everybody to fuck off.

181
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,969
I tolerated that
while we were living together.

182
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,239
I like Dan
but he messed around a lot.

183
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,210
I hated that.

184
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,579
So I did what I wanted to do.

185
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:36,710
I was never unfaithful.

186
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,030
But he cheated on me.

187
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,760
I don't know ...

188
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,070
For how long were you together?
- 3 years.

189
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,840
Not bad, right?

190
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,429
There wasn't anyone I could talk to
about my problems with Dan.

191
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,199
So I kept them to myself.

192
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,769
That's my mom with me and her dog.

193
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,929
My mom ...

194
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,969
She likes living on the countryside.

195
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,699
She doesn't like living in a city.

196
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,789
Have you ever talked to Josef about his job?

197
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,949
No, I haven't.

198
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,539
What work?
- In the adult film business.

199
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,920
I have to admit,
we never did.

200
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,780
And I think he'd lie.
He would be afraid to tell me about it.

201
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,010
I don't even know
if he still does it.

202
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,809
And I don't know either
how I'd react.

203
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,900
Probably nothing would happen.

204
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,260
He's my son
but I still don't like what he does.

205
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,219
Let's be honest,
I don't like what he does.

206
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,070
But we always forgive our children,
no matter what.

207
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:42,269
He said he was buying groceries.

208
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,059
That shouldn't be a problem.

209
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:56,289
You've gotta find a job and an apartment

210
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,440
and you have to buy
all the stuff you need.

211
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:03,849
It's getting colder.
- Yes, it's cold.

212
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,639
I don't like getting up in the morning.

213
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,699
I don't want to work either.

214
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,110
It's hard.
You never have enough time.

215
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,829
But that's life.

216
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,630
But you can't change that.

217
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,119
When I was your age, I already had had you.

218
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,519
You were born
and life changed.

219
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:40,380
It changed a lot.

220
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,989
Sure, it was easier for us
than it is for you now.

221
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,059
My name is Petr Sokub.
I'm from Jablonec nad Niosou.

222
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,329
I'm 27 years old
and I've been in Prague for 10 years now.

223
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,269
I sell my body
in order to be able to survive.

224
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,469
I appeared in 14 porn movies.

225
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,889
It felt good.

226
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,139
I'm an exhibitionist

227
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,840
so I liked it.

228
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,380
I have several jobs.
I drive a cab,

229
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,119
I'm an employee at a company

230
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,550
and I'm a porn model.

231
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,909
I started driving a cab

232
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,460
because I wanted to buy a car.

233
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:18,940
The monthly installments are pretty high.

234
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,199
I'm an employee because I like the job

235
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,400
and because I did that before.

236
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,610
But nowadays I don't work there that often.

237
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:50,329
Okay, now pull the t-shirt up.

238
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,230
Show us just one nipple.

239
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,880
Okay.

240
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,309
Now you rub your hand over it
and spread the stuff.

241
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,170
Now go for it!

242
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,610
One more.

243
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,909
And Filip.

244
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:00,050
That's my fishing jacket.

245
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,449
I had been drinking a lot.

246
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,869
And there was this big dog.

247
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:17,309
Right into my face.

248
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,170
Oh, fuck!

249
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,570
One tooth here and one tooth there.

250
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,269
Fuck!
- Fortunately it's not that bad.

251
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,590
Big as a pony.

252
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,809
Idiot.

253
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,510
Dan stayed in Prague.

254
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,519
It's pretty.
I don't know where he got it from.

255
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,469
He prefers pines.
- Firs are prettier.

256
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:40,480
I don't know where he got it from.

257
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:46,619
I don't wanna constrain my son

258
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,860
or force him into anything,
like his father does.

259
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,059
He should decide himself
what makes him happy.

260
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,550
And when he's found it,

261
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:05,840
hopefully he'll come to me
and we can talk about it

262
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,019
without me having to ask a lot of questions.

263
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,639
I once managed to do that
but I don't know how it went.

264
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,260
We were at some spa town.

265
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,099
They know I used to work
in the adult industry.

266
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,360
But not a lot of people know that.

267
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,630
We don't really care.

268
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,110
How do you feel about it, Lenka?

269
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,800
About what he did?

270
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,409
I couldn't do it.

271
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,869
And I think,
if he were to start with that again,

272
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:22,920
I definitely couldn't accept it.

273
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,179
I don't know.

274
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,300
Surely not.

275
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:35,130
I think, I'd have a problem with it.

276
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,000
You wouldn't,
if we went on a trip to Egypt afterwards.

277
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:44,809
No, I'd rather earn my own money
instead of ...

278
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,829
Instead of what?
It's just a job. A regular job.

279
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:53,289
Lots of people don't get that.

280
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,139
They don't get the business.

281
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,820
For the people in the business
it's just a job.

282
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,050
A normal job.

283
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,190
I think, I'd have a problem with it.

284
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,500
Maybe if you took me along
so that I could watch.

285
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,250
Why not?

286
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,730
I wouldn't mind watching.

287
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:33,730
I'd like to be a super-star,
like Jim Carrey.

288
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,539
We'd better hide the girls.

289
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,809
All of them.

290
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,200
So, what is it all about?

291
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,480
First of all, it's about satisfying your sexual needs

292
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,560
and if you've been alone for a long time

293
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,160
then that's what you have. Well ...

294
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,920
It's also because it's fun.

295
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,640
If you don't have a steady partner

296
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:41,120
and if you've been in
a monogamous relationship for a long time

297
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,800
then you try out something new
and actually, it's a lot of fun.

298
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,640
I was with my first boy-friend for 17 years.

299
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:03,320
After he died,
cause you hear a lot about it in pubs and bars,

300
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,960
I thought to myself,
they're all fine with it, why don't you?

301
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,960
So I gave it a try.

302
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:22,760
Well ... at first I thought it was great.
Getting to see new people, something new.

303
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:28,080
Getting to know them was great at first.

304
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:36,400
But still, I'd always rather have my old love back.
Simple as that.

305
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,659
Money, my friend.

306
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:46,650
If you have money,
you don't need to dream.

307
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,650
You're calm, you don't worry.
You buy whatever you need.

308
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,449
But do you know the feeling
of not having any?

309
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,500
Your fridge is empty,
you're hungry.

310
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:05,130
And you ask God:
Why am I so unlucky?

311
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,039
I don't have anything to do anymore
with the porn industry.

312
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,090
And I don't want to.

313
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:20,930
I haven't been in the business
for a year and a half now.

314
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,939
I work as a technican
for a cable TV broadcaster.

315
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,829
I'm a supplier.
That's okay.

316
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,939
That's the result.
- Thanks! Really great!
