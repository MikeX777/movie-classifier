1
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,306
What's going on, Hop?

2
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,875
You back again?

3
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,486
Oh, sick!

4
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,386
Find good one?

5
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,790
Ten Tigers of Kwangtung.
This is gold.

6
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:02,292
Bride With White Hair.
Chinese, no subtitles.

7
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,893
You have any early Shaw Brothers?
This one guy does Leopard style...

8
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,599
Leopard style, Dragon style...

9
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,604
...fly through air
...fight on water.

10
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,881
Crouching Tiger...
Spanking Monkey.

11
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,983
I know you.

12
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,280
Another white boy
who wants to know gongfu.

13
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:25,380
Kick the ass.
Get the girls.

14
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,098
Only storage back here.

15
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,906
- Where did you get this?
- It was here...

16
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,108
...when my grandfather
opened this shop.

17
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,215
A hundred years ago.

18
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,178
He waited for a man
to come pick it up...

19
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,686
...return to rightful owner.

20
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,089
Man never came.

21
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,589
My father took over the shop.
Waited, too.

22
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,701
Long time. Now me.

23
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,696
That's a Northern
Temple-style bo staff.

24
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,905
The kind the 13 monks
used to save the Tang Emperor.

25
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,100
I've seen it before.

26
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,304
That exact one.
I've had dreams about it.

27
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,210
You know why?

28
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,477
You watch too much
"Hong Kong Phooey".

29
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,881
Come.

30
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,684
I give you five awesome
Bruce Lee movie...

31
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,293
...for very sick price.

32
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,191
You're the man, Hop.

33
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,209
Jason!

34
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,205
What's up?

35
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,975
- Not much. Just cruising.
- I mean Chinatown.

36
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,084
What's with that?

37
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,585
- Gongfu.
- Are you serious?

38
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,281
I can't talk about it...
gongfu code.

39
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,383
Look... the new kid's marking time
with the hoodsies.

40
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,996
You still riding
this loser cruiser?

41
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,292
Get a motor for this shit.

42
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,099
- What we got here?
- Just some bootlegs.

43
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,000
Enter the Dragon.

44
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,401
- Bride With White Hair?
- That's actually very good.

45
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,812
Let him go.
He knows gongfu.

46
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,179
What?
You think you're Chinese?

47
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,786
You hang out
with them Chinks in C-town?

48
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,680
What's up with you?
Let's see some, man.

49
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,486
Come on. Let's see some gongfu.
Gongfu master.

50
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,996
Want some tae kwon do, huh?

51
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,895
Yo, Lupo.

52
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,698
He hangs out with
that Chink who cashes checks.

53
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,708
You in tight with the old man?

54
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,781
Just shut up and do it!

55
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,483
It's late.
He's probably gone.

56
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,391
- He's not here. Let's go.
- Who's there?

57
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,499
Gongfu boy.

58
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,300
You back for
more good-price movie?

59
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:12,875
I told you... best deal
in Chinatown. Come in.

60
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,081
Want some tea?

61
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,086
Red Sox game is on.

62
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,986
Yankees winning. Very bad.

63
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:31,399
- Who is with you? Friend?
- Where do you keep the cash?

64
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,602
Where's the cash?

65
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,212
Come on, old man!

66
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,872
You stay here!

67
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,096
I found your Xbox.

68
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,304
Hop!

69
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,108
Jesus, Lupo!

70
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,610
- What the hell?
- You shot him!

71
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,214
Take it.

72
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,683
Must return to rightful owner.

73
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,184
Run.

74
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,689
You didn't see that.

75
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,782
You didn't see that!

76
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,199
Come here, you little shit!

77
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,672
Lupo, come on, man!

78
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,283
- You didn't see nothing!
- Calm down.

79
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,978
- Hey, chill. Man. Put the gun down.
- Shut up!

80
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,090
I pulled the trigger,
but we're in this together!

81
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,886
But this little cockroach
ain't one of us!

82
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,203
Excuse me.
I don't know where I am.

83
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,596
I don't know how I got here.
I remember falling.

84
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,493
What? This?

85
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,293
You want this?

86
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,610
I don't know
what you're saying.

87
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,373
I can't understand you!

88
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,579
That's because
you're not listening!

89
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,685
Behind you!

90
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,586
I don't know where I am...

91
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,992
...how I got here, or who those guys
trying to kill me were.

92
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,497
But what you did
back there was sick.

93
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,602
No. Drunken Fist.

94
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,398
Secret gongfu from the South.

95
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,203
I am Lu Yan, traveling scholar.

96
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,711
What land do you
come from, monk?

97
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,710
I'm not a monk.

98
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:52,783
I'm Jason Tripikitas,
from South Boston.

99
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,085
Is this a dream?

100
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,586
No.

101
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,590
Where you came from
is the dream.

102
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,286
Through the Gate of No Gate.

103
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,193
Is that like a wormhole
or something?

104
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,597
No. It means
you are either a Zen master

105
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,401
or you carry something
very special.

106
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,800
This?

107
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,504
It was in a pawn shop,
waiting for a man to pick it up...

108
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,910
...and return it
to its rightful owner.

109
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,206
What?

110
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,375
It's long been foretold...

111
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,877
...that a seeker will come...

112
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,287
...to return the staff and
end the reign of the Jade Warlord.

113
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,290
Return it to who?

114
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,796
The Monkey King.

115
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,898
Born of a stone...

116
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,398
...on a mountain of
fruit and flowers.

117
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:48,095
<i>With his weapon in hand,</i>
<i>his qi became like fire...</i>

118
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,708
<i>... his stick fighting like magic.</i>

119
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,505
<i>He defied the order of the land...</i>

120
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,978
<i>... but the Jade Army</i>
<i>could not defeat him.</i>

121
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,799
<i>The Monkey King crushed</i>
<i>every soldier sent to stop him.</i>

122
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,602
<i>With his magical staff</i>
<i>he was unbeatable.</i>

123
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,513
<i>Word of his disobedience traveled deep</i>
<i>within the Forbidden Kingdom...</i>

124
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,982
<i>... to the Five Elements Mountain,</i>
<i>land of the immortals.</i>

125
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,383
<i>Once every 500 years...</i>

126
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,582
<i>... the Jade Emperor hosts</i>
<i>the Peach Banquet.</i>

127
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,185
<i>Here, the heavenly ministers</i>
<i>gather to celebrate their longevity...</i>

128
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,492
<i>... and drink</i>
<i>the elixir of immortality.</i>

129
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:52,803
<i>One sip of this heavenly brew</i>
<i>will give everlasting life...</i>

130
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,499
<i>... free from mortal suffering</i>
<i>and desire.</i>

131
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:04,277
<i>Into the banquet,</i>
<i>the Monkey King crashed, uninvited.</i>

132
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,878
<i>The Jade Emperor was enchanted</i>
<i>by the Monkey King.</i>

133
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,391
<i>But the Jade Warlord</i>
<i>was not amused.</i>

134
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,085
<i>As master of the army,</i>

135
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,188
<i>the Warlord demanded that</i>
<i>the Monkey King bow down to him.</i>

136
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,607
He's a bit unrefined,
that's all.

137
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,979
Give the naughty monkey a title
and let him go.

138
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,290
<i>Satisfied all was well</i>
<i>in heaven and earth...</i>

139
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,690
<i>... the supremely high Emperor left to</i>
<i>begin his 500 years meditation...</i>

140
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:54,492
<i>... leaving the Jade Warlord in charge</i>
<i>by mandate of heaven.</i>

141
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,193
<i>Rather than obey</i>
<i>the Jade Emperor's command...</i>

142
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,396
<i>... the Warlord challenged</i>
<i>the Monkey King to a duel.</i>

143
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,900
<i>High atop Five Elements Mountain</i>
<i>in the Warlord's palace...</i>

144
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,205
<i>... the battle of</i>
<i>immortals was fought...</i>

145
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,477
<i>... to prove once and for all</i>
<i>whose skills were supreme.</i>

146
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,212
Most excellent stick fighting,
Sun Wukong.

147
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,282
But without your weapon,
you're just a lowly hermit!

148
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,382
No more weapons.
No more qi magic.

149
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,681
Fist against fist.

150
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,593
<i>The Monkey King was too trusting</i>
<i>and believed the Warlord...</i>

151
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,890
<i>... laying down his magic weapon.</i>

152
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,197
<i>Realizing he'd been tricked,</i>
<i>the Monkey King</i>

153
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,707
<i>cast the staff out into</i>
<i>the Middle Kingdom.</i>

154
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,489
Martial art is
based on deception...

155
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,497
...my friend.

156
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,506
<i>Being immortal, the Monkey King</i>
<i>could not be killed...</i>

157
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,601
<i>... only trapped in stone,</i>
<i>where he waits for the seeker...</i>

158
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,683
<i>... to return his great weapon to him</i>
<i>and finally free him.</i>

159
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,689
That's what I heard, anyway.

160
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,799
A long time ago.

161
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,300
- How long has he been imprisoned?
- Five hundred years,

162
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,803
give or take a few decades.

163
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:32,501
They say when the Monkey King is free,
the Jade Emperor will return.

164
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,613
How do I get home?

165
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,478
You must return the staff to
Five Elements Mountain.

166
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,984
You must free the Monkey King.

167
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,486
I can't free the Monkey King.
I have to get home.

168
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,591
Innkeeper! More wine.

169
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,989
Geez, Don't you think
you had one too many?

170
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,896
Wine is my inspiration.

171
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,090
In some parts,
I am known as the Poet.

172
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,393
Ganbei.

173
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,805
In other parts,
I am known as the Beggar.

174
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,699
- What do we now?
- How good is your gongfu?

175
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,998
He who speaks does not know.
He who knows does not speak.

176
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,403
Surely, you are masterful.

177
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,180
- Where'd you get that weapon?
- It's a fake.

178
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,979
You can find anything
these days on the Silk Road.

179
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,780
Out of the way, old fool.

180
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,491
Hand it over.

181
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,495
Hand over the weapon...
or die.

182
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,203
Go!

183
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,005
Lu, help!

184
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,199
Protect yourself!

185
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,803
Let's go!

186
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,588
Where are you going?

187
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,194
- Jump!
- I don't think so!

188
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,595
Don't think! Just do!

189
00:27:58,643 --> 00:27:59,803
Come on!

190
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,881
Thank you!

191
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,693
Such skill!

192
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,390
Are you from
the north mountains?

193
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,900
She is Golden Sparrow,
from the south.

194
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,586
You saved our lives back there.

195
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,695
I don't know what we would
have done if you hadn't come along.

196
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:25,887
She does nothing.

197
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,794
The Drunken lmmortal
did not need his life saved.

198
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,096
You're immortal?

199
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,997
What do you run from, child?

200
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,803
Bounty hunters trying to stop her
from reaching Five Elements Mountain.

201
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:49,580
I suggest you keep riding west
and only stop to water your horses.

202
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,380
You're not coming?

203
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:54,390
The journey to the mountain
crosses barrens and deserts.

204
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,686
Unspeakable dangers.

205
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,294
Worst of all, no wine.

206
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,488
His elixir.
Every immortal has one.

207
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,600
I'm very sorry.
Without wine, I would perish.

208
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,292
You must understand this.

209
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,404
No. You must understand this.

210
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,006
This is insane!

211
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,005
- Do you wish to get home?
- Yes.

212
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,207
Then listen well!

213
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,782
If you die here, you'll be found
dead in the world you left behind.

214
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,282
Do you understand?

215
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,985
My jug is getting low.
I must say good-bye. Bye-bye.

216
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,995
Lu!

217
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,495
Wait!

218
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:43,601
Let him go. You are the one
to return the staff, not him.

219
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,905
How good is your gongfu?

220
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,013
He has no gongfu. None!

221
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,375
Lu, wait!

222
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,177
Teach me.

223
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,478
Teach me to fight!

224
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,393
Swing soft, cut hard!
At the same time!

225
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,200
He's terrible.

226
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,107
I've been your weed-whacker
for two days...

227
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,802
...while you sit like
the King of England.

228
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,502
When do I learn gongfu?

229
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,978
- You want to learn gongfu?
- Yeah.

230
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,084
I'll teach you gongfu.

231
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,886
That's a strike.
Tomorrow I'll teach you to block.

232
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,289
Let's go!

233
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,492
Swing soft. Cut hard.

234
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,185
Will I learn the No Shadow Kick?

235
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,291
And the Buddha Palm Technique?

236
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:15,388
There's a guy in "Virtual Fighter 2"
who uses Buddha Palm... thanks, Lu...

237
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,501
...and he does the...

238
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,097
...lron Elbow...

239
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,798
...and One-Fingered Death Touch.

240
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,808
The cup's full.
Stop! It's full.

241
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:31,272
Exactly. How can you fill your cup
if already full?

242
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,079
How can you learn gongfu?
You already know so much.

243
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,986
No Shadow Kick.
Buddha Palm!

244
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,181
Empty your cup.

245
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,493
Hopeless. It is hopeless.

246
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,781
It is said that music...

247
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:16,289
...is a bridge
between earth and heaven.

248
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:18,895
That's beautiful.

249
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,705
It belonged to her mother.

250
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,281
My Lord...

251
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:18,678
How dare you...
can't you see I am busy?

252
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,690
The divine staff of legend.

253
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,691
It was seen in the Middle Kingdom.

254
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:25,993
Impossible.

255
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,590
The villagers are beginning to
whisper of prophecy.

256
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:38,903
Mortals are always
whispering of prophecy.

257
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,102
It's their opium.

258
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,680
What other offending news
do you have for me?

259
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,585
That is all, My Lord.

260
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,795
Summon the Witch...
the one born of wolves.

261
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,670
Where were we?

262
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,489
Lu Yan?

263
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,893
Lu Yan?

264
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,106
Lu Yan?

265
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,603
Lu Yan!

266
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,576
Sparrow!

267
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,187
- Are you all right?
- Jason, what happened?

268
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,491
He took it! The staff!

269
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,201
The Jade Warlord
has sent a bounty hunter.

270
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,804
We are doomed.

271
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,381
That's his horse.
He must be inside.

272
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,382
Why would he take
refuge in a temple?

273
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,981
That's what I intend to find out.
Wait with the horses.

274
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,591
Ah! Good to get off my feet.

275
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,286
Long day.

276
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,998
So, where are you from?

277
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,793
Shandong Province?

278
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,495
You look like
the Shandong Province type.

279
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,196
You come here often?

280
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,909
That staff doesn't belong to you.

281
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,380
You have to give it to me,
or somebody might get hurt.

282
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,790
What kind of monk are you? Huh?

283
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,493
Stealing from travelers.

284
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,201
A silent one, I see.

285
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,008
Or deaf.

286
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,908
I'm speaking to you, monk!

287
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,574
Praying Mantis.
Very good...

288
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,878
...for catching bugs.
But not tiger!

289
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,203
You try to steal
the staff for the Warlord!

290
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,805
No, fool!

291
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,399
I'm on a mission to find
the seeker of the staff.

292
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,688
You found him.

293
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,079
He's not even Chinese.

294
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:13,274
We are all the same inside,
aren't we, Monk?

295
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,975
Heaven help us.

296
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,383
What, you find it a sin?

297
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:22,481
Yes, it is sinful not to share.

298
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,991
Cheers!

299
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,407
How long have you
searched for the staff?

300
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,910
As long as I can remember.

301
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,184
An old man and boy.
They took tea here. Yes?

302
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,082
A Soldier Monk rides with them.

303
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,184
Who else?

304
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,382
I do not know who you speak of.

305
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:48,611
Men are such liars.

306
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,890
Sparrow.

307
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,297
Sparrow...

308
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,696
...where do you nest?

309
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,477
Jason, go deeper!

310
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:35,183
Must taste bitter before sweet.
Horse stance. Grow roots.

311
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,702
Horse stance.

312
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,009
Very good...
for taking a dump.

313
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,379
Enough from you!

314
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,880
He's my student, not yours!

315
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,577
Two tigers cannot live
on the same mountain.

316
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,586
Two masters cannot teach
the same student!

317
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,285
Ma bu!

318
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,191
If he is really
to learn the gongfu...

319
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,595
...he must develop speed,
accuracy and power.

320
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,201
Hey! I know that.

321
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,396
It's the Way of the Intercepting Fist.
Bruce Lee?

322
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,174
I will punch. You block.

323
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,476
Ready?

324
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,382
What did I teach you
about the Snake?

325
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,991
Now you punch me.

326
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,490
See?

327
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,491
Again. You punch him again.
Snake!

328
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,802
He's not ready for Snake.
Perhaps Eagle.

329
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,805
Crane! Crane!

330
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:01,303
Okay?

331
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,481
Stop!

332
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,581
I've had enough!

333
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,593
No more!
No more silent riddles!

334
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,390
And no more empty cups!

335
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,999
First, you show respect
to your teachers!

336
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,404
So... What about the two tigers
on one mountain?

337
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,679
We can kill each other
when it's over.

338
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:52,587
<i>Gongfu. Hard work over time</i>
<i>to accomplish skill.</i>

339
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,094
<i>A painter can have gongfu.</i>

340
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:04,105
<i>Or the butcher who cuts meat</i>
<i>every day with such skill...</i>

341
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,903
<i>... his knife never touches bone.</i>

342
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:14,973
<i>Learn the form,</i>
<i>but seek the formless.</i>

343
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,086
<i>Hear the soundless.</i>

344
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,986
<i>Learn it all, then forget it all.</i>

345
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,891
<i>Learn The Way,</i>
<i>then find your own way.</i>

346
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,491
<i>The musician can have gongfu.</i>

347
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,601
<i>Or the poet</i>
<i>who paints pictures with words</i>

348
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,600
<i>and makes emperors weep.</i>

349
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,297
<i>This, too, is gongfu.</i>

350
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,809
<i>But do not name it, my friend,</i>
<i>for it is like water.</i>

351
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,105
<i>Nothing is softer than water...</i>

352
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,976
<i>... yet it can overcome rock.</i>

353
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:51,076
<i>It does not fight.</i>
<i>It flows around the opponent.</i>

354
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:56,181
<i>Formless, nameless</i>
<i>the true master dwells within.</i>

355
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,090
<i>Only you can free him.</i>

356
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,285
Behold the tyranny of the Warlord.

357
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,688
He must be stopped.

358
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:12,097
He must be killed for his crimes
and his head put on a post.

359
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:17,096
One must not feel hatred
towards him, or he wins.

360
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,809
If he speaks of compassion
for this devil...

361
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,873
...he should go back to
his temple and pray.

362
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:28,881
Our mission is not one of peace.

363
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:33,285
Go back to your mother and father.
You are but a child.

364
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,585
They are dead.

365
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,993
And she's not a child.

366
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,292
Not anymore.

367
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:51,296
Her father was a government official
who opposed the Warlord.

368
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,707
<i>And so, to set an example...</i>

369
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:59,577
<i>... the Warlord dispatched</i>
<i>his troops into the night.</i>

370
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:08,285
<i>Legion upon legion poured out of</i>
<i>the Five Elements Mountain...</i>

371
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,485
<i>... into the lowlands of</i>
<i>the Middle Kingdom.</i>

372
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,990
<i>Screams of innocent people</i>
<i>hung in the night air.</i>

373
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:24,899
<i>When it was over,</i>
<i>charred ruins were all that remained.</i>

374
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:30,370
<i>That, and a lonely child,</i>
<i>hidden in the well by her mother...</i>

375
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,774
<i>... ruthlessly murdered by an arrow...</i>

376
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,285
<i>... from the Warlord's bow.</i>

377
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,694
When she reaches
the Warlord's palace...

378
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,898
...she will not
offer him forgiveness...

379
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,892
...monk.

380
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,201
She will offer him...

381
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,306
...this...

382
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,374
...a jade dart
that can kill an immortal.

383
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,483
Long has she practiced.

384
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,684
Vengeance has a way of
rebounding upon oneself.

385
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,299
Master of sensitivity.

386
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,180
It is them.
They're headed towards the desert.

387
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:46,385
They are between me
and the River of Sand.

388
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,589
Isn't itjust like King Monkey?

389
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:55,187
Summoning a boy to do a man's job?

390
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:13,380
Damn. This desert is hot.

391
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,982
This is not a desert.

392
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,987
That is the desert!

393
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,186
I hope you know
where you're going!

394
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,887
Crazy monk.

395
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,207
A monk on a mission!

396
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,576
And where does he lead us?
Across a desert to nowhere!

397
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,208
We're not going to make it,
are we?

398
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,377
Even if we do,
we still must face the Jade Army.

399
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,178
What if I can't handle it?

400
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,290
What if I freeze?

401
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,295
Don't forget to breathe.

402
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:23,096
If we don't find water soon,
we will perish.

403
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:29,601
Perhaps a Taoist immortal
can make rain.

404
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:35,175
If he truly is a Taoist immortal.

405
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:04,304
You are an insult to
the name of Buddha! Blasphemy!

406
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,503
No!

407
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,172
I lead you to the mountain!

408
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,374
Out there!

409
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,279
Can you see them...

410
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,686
...in the clouds?

411
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,184
A two-headed lion.

412
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,395
Right there.

413
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,295
See?

414
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,297
Yeah, I see.

415
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,204
See that one?
There, coming up behind it?

416
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,004
Like a wave?

417
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,400
Looks like the Green Monster.

418
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:51,271
Green monster?
You mean dragon.

419
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,074
No, I mean Fenway Park.

420
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:57,486
They call the left field fence
the Green Monster.

421
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,386
It's true.

422
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,987
It does kind of look like
a dragon, though.

423
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:13,498
Have you family,
back in this land you come from?

424
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,498
My mother.

425
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,905
Father?

426
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,901
Never knew him.

427
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,772
Do you ever long for him?

428
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,676
Wonder who he was?

429
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:35,989
Maybe the only thing
I've ever been good at...

430
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,292
...is pretending I don't.

431
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,896
She is sorry.

432
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:50,201
How romantic.

433
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:55,699
Men will tell you
what you want to hear, Sparrow.

434
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:59,781
But in the end,
they will leave you with nothing.

435
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,585
You survived the River of Sand.

436
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,987
Impressive.
And you, boy...

437
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,389
...so far from home.

438
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:16,294
I can ensure your safe return.
Just bring the weapon forward.

439
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:17,899
I don't think so.

440
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,399
Why do you want the staff?

441
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,698
When I deliver the lost weapon...

442
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,504
...the Jade Warlord shall grant me
the Elixir of lmmortality.

443
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,781
An orphan girl,
a lost traveler...

444
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,382
...an old drunk...

445
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:39,079
...and a monk who has failed at
the same task for half his life.

446
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:45,684
Misfits following a misfit
in hopes of rescuing... a misfit.

447
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,076
Kill them.

448
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,597
Lu! Are you okay?

449
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,502
Just thirsty.

450
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,398
It's okay.
He's immortal. Right?

451
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,590
I mean... He is, right?

452
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,496
Wine. He needs his wine!

453
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:40,897
There is nothing we can do.

454
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,699
What?!
We have to do something!

455
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,405
I'm afraid the wound is too deep.

456
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,807
He will not survive it.

457
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,979
He needs wine.

458
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:30,577
He's one of the Eight lmmortals.
Wine is his elixir. Please.

459
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,683
We will send a walking monk.

460
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:37,886
Don't you have a running monk?

461
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,583
When I was your age...

462
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,281
...I was a scholar-warrior
in training.

463
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,580
My arrow was good.
So, too, my gongfu.

464
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:15,889
So I was chosen to
take the civil examinations.

465
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,294
To pass would place me...

466
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:24,304
...in the very short line of
scholar immortals.

467
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:28,503
I failed.

468
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,870
You're not an immortal?

469
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:40,483
If one does not attach himself
to people and desires...

470
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,193
...never shall his heart be broken.

471
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,487
But then...

472
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,492
...does he ever truly live?

473
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,101
I would rather die a mortal...

474
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,903
...who has cared about someone...

475
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:07,482
...than a man free
from his own death.

476
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,486
I don't want to lose you.

477
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:16,284
Forget about me.

478
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,992
<i>There is only one</i>
<i>Elixir of lmmortality.</i>

479
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:28,195
It is the Emperor's mix ofjade
cinnabar and salts of mercury.

480
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:32,797
It is forever stored
in the realm of the Jade Palace...

481
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:38,177
...high in the Jade Firmament,
rarely touched by mortals.

482
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:42,683
To reach it, one must take
the north road and cross the border...

483
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,184
...of heaven and earth...

484
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,882
...only to face the Jade Army.

485
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,394
I'm sorry.

486
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:55,190
There is no other way.

487
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,799
Yes, there is.

488
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,102
In two nights,
there will be no moon.

489
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,104
We can take the south side
of the fourth peak

490
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,504
under cover of darkness.

491
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,407
- We have to go now.
- No!

492
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:10,778
He's going to die!

493
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,375
We go now, we all die.

494
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:22,282
There is more at stake...
an entire kingdom.

495
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,887
Your passage home.

496
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:34,493
We will advance in two nights,
when the moon has ceased.

497
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,002
So be it!

498
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,886
When she met you...

499
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:29,081
...long ago in a tea house...

500
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,285
...you were a lost boy
and frightened.

501
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,797
Not the kind she would stand
and fight with.

502
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:36,072
You have made
a most excellentjudgment.

503
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:55,603
The seeker from the prophecy.

504
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,604
Not quite what I expected.

505
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:02,006
A man is dying
back on Song Mountain.

506
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,472
I need the Elixir.

507
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:08,174
And why should I give it to you?

508
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,285
Because I brought you the staff.

509
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:14,685
The life of your friend for
the power to rule a kingdom?

510
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:17,884
A most reasonable offer.

511
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:21,692
This man is a good friend?

512
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,994
And a good teacher.

513
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:27,899
The man who honors his teacher
honors himself.

514
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,200
However,

515
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,900
there is a bit of a problem
with your request.

516
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,600
You see...

517
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:39,771
...l've promised
the Elixir to someone else.

518
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:43,078
But she didn't bring
you the staff. I did.

519
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,680
The boy has a point.

520
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,985
My Liege, you made a promise.

521
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:55,695
There is but one way
to resolve such matters.

522
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:59,494
A martial challenge...
to the death.

523
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,395
With pleasure.

524
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,584
The Elixir of lmmortality.

525
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:30,194
The prize goes to the winner.

526
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:56,670
Enough!

527
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,087
The seeker from the prophecy.

528
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,892
I find that quite amusing.

529
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,693
Did you really think,
even for a minute,

530
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,701
you stood a chance?

531
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,802
I didn't think so.

532
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,494
She will kill you, witch!

533
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:30,901
Not if I kill you first,
orphan bitch!

534
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,105
Ganbei!

535
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,991
Remember what I taught you!

536
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,190
The statue!

537
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,287
Use the staff!

538
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:33,996
My turn!

539
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,206
My Lord.

540
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,103
Who are you?

541
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:24,678
The youngest daughter of
a family you murdered.

542
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:28,478
Come drink with me.

543
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,094
No!

544
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:56,209
Sparrow! Sparrow.

545
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:59,773
Come on. Come on.

546
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,575
You're going to be okay.

547
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,901
Jade Warlord?

548
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:37,176
He's dead.

549
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:45,585
I...

550
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,587
...I thank you.

551
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,476
Is there anything you can do?

552
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:52,284
Her destiny was written by
her own hand.

553
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,582
I am sorry.

554
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:30,889
Traveler...

555
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:34,490
...you came far,
through the Gate of No Gate...

556
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:37,894
...to fulfill the prophecy
of the mortals.

557
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:40,894
What do you desire, please?

558
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:44,201
I just want to go home.

559
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,005
Very well.

560
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:55,878
It is said master and student...

561
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:57,575
...walk the path side-by-side.

562
01:30:57,718 --> 01:31:01,484
They share their destiny
until their paths go separate ways.

563
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:10,297
I'll never forget you.

564
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:13,889
I guess that's what being
immortal truly means.

565
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,999
You freed me, traveler.

566
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,976
Now go free yourself.

567
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,980
So what's it going to be?

568
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:19,283
You gonna shut up?

569
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:30,301
Listen, pissant!
I ain't gonna ask you again!

570
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:45,278
Come on, maggot, get up!

571
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,480
You want some more?
You want some more?

572
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,482
Uh? Come on!

573
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,088
We don't have to do this.

574
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:08,493
Take it easy, sir.
You'll be fine.

575
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:10,797
Hop!

576
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:14,499
- How is he?
- It missed his heart. He'll live.

577
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:19,970
Of course I'll live.
I'm immortal.

578
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:25,779
Did you return the staff
to rightful owner?

579
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:28,186
I did.

580
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,191
You're the man.

581
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:12,096
Will he be all right?

582
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:16,400
Looks like it.

583
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:20,395
I saw what happened.
I work across the street.

584
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:22,702
You were very brave.

585
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:27,177
See you.

586
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:31,875
Absolutely.

587
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,492
<i>And so the legend is told...</i>

588
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,400
<i>... that the Monkey King</i>
<i>began his journey west</i>

589
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:53,507
<i>in search of truth...</i>

590
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:56,309
<i>... while the traveler</i>
<i>returned to his world...</i>

591
01:36:56,443 --> 01:37:01,176
<i>... to walk the path of the warrior</i>
<i>and find his own truth.</i>

592
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:03,783
<i>As one tale ends...</i>

593
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:06,182
<i>... so another begins.</i>
