1
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,372
Long before the heavens
had taken form...

2
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:27,041
there existed an angel-like figure...

3
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,878
a goddess,
whom the ancients called Emperia.

4
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:34,799
From within her
came the seed of fire and light...

5
00:00:35,133 --> 00:01:44,964
that was to issue forth all stars,
planets, and moons.

6
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:07,141
From this great beginning,
the planet Earth was formed...

7
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:10,227
together with its satellite,
the moon.

8
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,147
Then, one day...

9
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,233
the gods,
the prime movers of the universe...

10
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,986
gave life to an earthly creature.

11
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:22,239
The mightiest,
the most heroic of all men:

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:06:46,636
Hercules.

13
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:49,817
Many honors were bestowed upon Hercules
for his deeds on earth...

14
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,403
and he took his rightful place
on Olympus...

15
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,532
from where Zeus, King of the Gods,
ruled peacefully...

16
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:59,493
thanks to his seven
mighty thunderbolts.

17
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,625
But one day,
foolish and envious gods...

18
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,753
stole the seven thunderbolts...

19
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,551
and unleashed the diabolical forces
of evil and chaos.

20
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,373
Be quiet, maiden.

21
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,626
You'll disturb the gods.

22
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:54,590
The altar is set.

23
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,135
The appointed hour has come.

24
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:07,603
The fires await her silken flanks.

25
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,067
To the altar.

26
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,948
Bind her in her chains.

27
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:23,118
No, I’ve done nothing!

28
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,288
Quiet, be still.

29
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,050
Untie me!

30
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:42,554
Cry not.
'Tis an honor to be chosen.

31
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,056
No!

32
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,559
The moon is high.
We are ready, my dear Antius.

33
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:50,854
The city of Phagesta offers you
another one of its daughters.

34
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:53,732
No, don't give me
to the fire monster!

35
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,819
You're privileged.
This is your destiny.

36
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,239
You must die
so that your people will live on.

37
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,699
No, don't let him take me.

38
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,618
He is evil!

39
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:06,620
She is yours, Antius.

40
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:23,637
Don't do this!

41
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,576
Glaucia.

42
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,077
What is it?

43
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,247
Antius, the fire monster.

44
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,292
Ilia's dead.

45
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,669
I was there.

46
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:42,049
The ghoulish fiend swallowed her
in his flames, consumed her slowly.

47
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,135
lt was horrible.

48
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,055
Who gives him his power?

49
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,143
He'll swallow us all, Urania.

50
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:56,563
One by one.

51
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,652
Why do our gods permit it?

52
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:07,658
Why has our clan been chosen
for this horror?

53
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:09,743
No, don't blame the gods.

54
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:14,206
You must have faith.
Please, be strong.

55
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,583
I want to have faith.

56
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,378
-It's difficult, though.
-I know.

57
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:22,589
I knew you went there.
I wanted to stop you.

58
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:25,175
You forget,
you're our chosen sister.

59
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:27,844
Our fate is in your destiny.

60
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:30,097
Has it revealed itself?

61
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,599
No, I think it's too early,
my sister.

62
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,936
I’ve only the power to predict,
not to prevent.

63
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,106
lt is said...

64
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:42,567
that you shall be
the next victim.

65
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:45,988
Ilia had come to me in a dream.

66
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,490
I went to her,
but it was too late.

67
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:50,784
And now....

68
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,869
I’d be willing to die...

69
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,455
to save our people.

70
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:59,418
But what's the good?
It'll only be in vain.

71
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,338
He'll consume us...

72
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,382
like he did Ilia.

73
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:08,093
Antius is evil.

74
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,929
He must be destroyed.

75
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:13,390
-There is a way.
-What are you saying?

76
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:15,225
That there's a way to destroy him.

77
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,185
-How?
-With cunning.

78
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:21,148
-I’ll go to the Little People.
-Yes, they use cunning to survive.

79
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:24,109
And I’m sure
they'll give me the right answer.

80
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:27,112
Have faith, Glaucia.
I’ll be back by morning.

81
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:08,361
Little People,
friends of Zeus...

82
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:11,740
please listen to my prayer.

83
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,085
We know
why you are here, Urania.

84
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:25,712
Terrible things are happening
in the universe.

85
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,298
Even the gods
have been led astray.

86
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:30,467
Four of them
rebelled against Zeus...

87
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,386
and stole his seven
mighty thunderbolts...

88
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,099
the secret,
the key to all his powers.

89
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:41,728
lt is your fate that calls,
and your coming here was already planned.

90
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:46,066
The architects of the universe
have lost control of the heavenly bodies.

91
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,401
Our moon is coming towards us.

92
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:52,114
Your destiny is interwoven
in the celestial upheaval.

93
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,909
And it will lead you to the one man
who can help you.

94
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:58,370
Who is he?
Where can I find him?

95
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:01,540
He's the strongest man
who has ever walked the earth.

96
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,708
A man called Hercules.

97
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,085
Hercules is still.

98
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:08,255
Yes, the invincible son of Zeus.

99
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:11,174
lt was he
who divided the continents...

100
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:14,970
as it was he
who had formed the constellations...

101
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:18,723
and who defeated King Minos
and his vast empire.

102
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,976
Yes. Hercules the Invincible.

103
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,187
And yet, nothing's been heard from him
for ages.

104
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:27,065
They say that Zeus
sent him up to the heavens...

105
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,025
and placed him
among the brightest stars.

106
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:32,571
Destiny says
it is you who must seek him.

107
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:37,284
Go with Glaucia to the Forbidden Valley.
That's where you shall meet him.

108
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:40,245
-Hercules.
-Yes. The Invincible.

109
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:07,522
They are crying
for Hercules, Zeus.

110
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,734
And we seem immune
to their suffering.

111
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,569
I have hesitated...

112
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,823
because Man must learn
to stand on his own two feet.

113
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:21,077
I blame our own gods
if Man has failed.

114
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:26,166
There has been wickedness
here in Olympus, and I am powerless.

115
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,126
The moon is wild.

116
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:32,255
It looms bigger every day
as it moves in on its mother planet.

117
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,927
The foolish gods who stole my seven
thunderbolts are the cause of this disorder.

118
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:41,181
There is no other hope but to summon
the greatest warrior ever known.

119
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,100
He will stop the rebel gods...

120
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:47,062
and recover
my seven thunderbolts.

121
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:57,489
Hercules, return to Earth.

122
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:02,410
Retrieve my seven thunderbolts
which allow me to maintain order.

123
00:17:02,870 --> 00:19:18,738
Make haste, Hercules, lest the planets
destroy themselves and all living things.

124
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,127
Hercules is here on Earth...

125
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,089
and has already converted
one of the seven thunderbolts.

126
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:05,051
Should he find all seven,
our plans will be shattered.

127
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:08,763
No. The lightning lies
in the bellies of monsters...

128
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,766
and they roam in places
inaccessible to man.

129
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:13,476
I hope you're right, Hera.

130
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:16,813
Zeus will be destroyed.
And as for Hercules...

131
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:20,316
someone has waited many years
for revenge.

132
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:25,071
-Am I right, Flora?
-I've arranged it all, dear Hera.

133
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:29,325
I've called upon
the warrior, Gorus.

134
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:34,914
He's ambitious, has few scruples,
and will consent to any request.

135
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:40,587
The fool seeks the status of a demigod,
but lacks the gentility.

136
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,506
He will serve us well.

137
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:47,802
Flora.

138
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,160
There you are.

139
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,996
First, you nearly blind me...

140
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,707
then you hide in shadow.

141
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,920
Why have you summoned me
to such a dreary place?

142
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:25,006
You always wanted to know
the secrets of darkness.

143
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,636
And now, your wish
is about to be answered.

144
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:31,346
Come.

145
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:56,704
This is....

146
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:04,504
-It's the secret tomb of King Minos of Thira.
-Good for you, Gorus.

147
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,130
His cursed ashes lie here.

148
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,093
But his knowledge and power
cannot be imprisoned forever.

149
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:12,387
Release them.

150
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,718
-He's nothing but bones.
-Of course.

151
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:54,846
But through resurrection,
he shall rise again.

152
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:57,473
But in order to have life...

153
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:59,434
one must take life.

154
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:00,977
Yours.

155
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:08,526
Poseidon.

156
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,238
Aphrodite.

157
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:15,575
Hera.

158
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:21,414
Minos can now be stirred
from his eternal sleep.

159
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:24,125
I have my misgivings, Flora.

160
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:27,211
Minos was always up to mischief
and deception.

161
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:29,881
But we've the power
to handle him.

162
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:33,051
Flora did well
to slay the warrior Gorus.

163
00:23:44,438 --> 00:23:47,607
Now, the blood of this man...

164
00:23:47,816 --> 00:23:50,568
will give life back to Minos.

165
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,878
Who awakens me?

166
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,306
'Tis you three.

167
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:08,563
What do you want, Hera?

168
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:12,108
Zeus has brought Hercules
back to life.

169
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,862
We need your help.
He must be eliminated.

170
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:19,240
And whatever you wish
will be yours.

171
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:21,701
No, Minos.

172
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:28,166
You know I’ve never put much stock
in the promises of gods.

173
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:33,087
But it's not often
that fulfilling one's obligations...

174
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:35,798
can be such a pleasure.

175
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:54,585
-Help! Help me!
-Easy. Calm down.

176
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,003
Calm down and I shall help.

177
00:26:56,088 --> 00:27:00,132
They thought I was dead,
but they took my friend Urania with them.

178
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:03,970
-Who took her?
-The Slime People. They ambushed us.

179
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:07,682
They rise out of the mud and mire
and hold you by suction.

180
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:09,433
Where did they go?

181
00:27:09,768 --> 00:27:11,394
Through the wild.

182
00:27:11,478 --> 00:27:15,064
-Towards the great mouth of stone.
-The Forbidden Valley.

183
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:17,775
You should know
that this is a very dangerous region.

184
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:29,829
This way.

185
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:48,264
Glaucia?

186
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,477
Urania.

187
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:59,775
-Hercules. I thought you were still...
-Hurry, there's no time now.

188
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:27,720
Hold on.

189
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:30,389
Good girl.

190
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:33,017
Come on!

191
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:53,913
-Quick, inside the stone mouth.
-They're coming!

192
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:55,706
Inside.

193
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:14,976
-What was that?
-lt could be the work of gods. Careful.

194
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:17,603
But the gods always forewarn
earthly people.

195
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,605
There are evil gods.

196
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,024
-How can we tell?
-Don't worry.

197
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:25,403
For now, no one's bothering us.

198
00:29:25,487 --> 00:29:28,864
They seemed afraid of this place.
And yet, they brought you here.

199
00:29:29,116 --> 00:29:32,034
They were going to sacrifice me
to something.

200
00:29:32,577 --> 00:29:34,996
Something that lives in here.

201
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,207
The currents change direction
at this point.

202
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:42,086
The airflow takes this way.
Come, follow me.

203
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:46,007
-Where do you want to--
-Quiet.

204
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,439
lt is we who trespass.

205
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:04,734
Welcome, earthlings.

206
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:09,905
lt is a rare pleasure to have you
in our midst.

207
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:14,660
Who art thou?

208
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:17,288
I am Euryale.

209
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:19,832
Come into my palace.

210
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,187
They look real.

211
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:49,403
These statues,
they look as quiet and still as mummies.

212
00:30:50,155 --> 00:30:53,324
As if the sculptor
caught his subjects unaware.

213
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:59,163
They have a very realistic look in the eye.
They seem to be tense, quivering.

214
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:02,958
There is nothing more beautiful
than the human body...

215
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:05,169
caught in a moment of tension...

216
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:09,006
and sculpted forever in stone...

217
00:31:09,257 --> 00:31:10,841
immortalized.

218
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:13,636
Great deeds make us immortal.

219
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:16,931
We can't all be so fortunate.

220
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:19,642
Come.

221
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:28,609
Where do you take us, Euryale?

222
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:30,194
To safety.

223
00:31:30,362 --> 00:31:34,281
These caves are a labyrinth.
lt is very easy to get lost.

224
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,036
-Beyond these columns lies the way out.
-We didn't come in through here.

225
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:43,457
You'll find another way out,
down there.

226
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:46,919
Visitors on these lands
are forbidden.

227
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:52,049
I’ve led you safely underground
through the Forbidden Valley.

228
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:55,136
We thank you for your help.

229
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:05,062
Fight them!

230
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,059
Euryale's gone.

231
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:48,397
She's one of the Gorgon monsters
who turn men into stone at a single glance.

232
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:50,566
She's one of the gods
I’m looking for.

233
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:53,861
Now that we've passed the Forbidden
Valley, we'll continue the journey.

234
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:56,655
-But you must leave this dungeon now--
-But--

235
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:59,617
Don't tempt the gods.
You must go now.

236
00:33:03,955 --> 00:33:06,207
Wait for me, I shan't be long.

237
00:33:30,232 --> 00:33:32,149
I am over here.

238
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:37,029
Poor Hercules.

239
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:40,115
King Zeus sent you
on a long journey.

240
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:43,661
What a shame
it must end here.

241
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,623
Be stilled forever, like stone.

242
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,251
With me.

243
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:53,712
I will find you! I'm coming.

244
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:56,215
Yes, do come.

245
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:58,968
Let me look at you.

246
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,911
I’m over here.

247
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:42,636
Come look at me.

248
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,268
Look at yourself, dear Euryale,
and use my shield as a mirror.

249
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:41,653
The second thunderbolt.

250
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:50,454
Hercules has discovered
the second thunderbolt.

251
00:35:51,122 --> 00:35:54,416
And Minos,
disappeared for three days...

252
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:55,876
and three nights.

253
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,836
Minos has been sailing east.

254
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:58,962
I know.

255
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:01,173
I followed him
to the edge of time and space.

256
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:05,302
-You could have changed the winds.
-His science changed them back.

257
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:09,473
He uses science against godly powers.
I don't trust him.

258
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:14,186
Our purpose is the same.
That is, to kill Hercules.

259
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,650
I must find a way to overcome
the fire monster's radiant heat.

260
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:22,361
I am not immune
to the energy Antius releases.

261
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,696
The Little People use cunning
against power.

262
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,033
-I think they'll listen to me.
-Then let us go to the Little People.

263
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:30,577
But to reach them,
we'll have to cross the Doomed Forest...

264
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:34,039
-where the demon Tartarus reigns.
-We can't go back now.

265
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:38,210
-Then you'll save the maidens of Phagesta?
-Fate has already willed it.

266
00:36:38,294 --> 00:36:41,797
Zeus has sent me here
to find his mighty thunderbolts.

267
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:45,259
And one of them is inside Antius' belly.

268
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,153
It's so gloomy here.
Like a land of lost souls.

269
00:37:04,237 --> 00:37:06,196
That's what they are.

270
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:09,825
They're dolls.
Hundreds of thousands.

271
00:37:11,744 --> 00:37:13,745
It's the work of a fiend.

272
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,416
Once, they were humans
or demigods.

273
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:21,211
This resembles hell on earth.

274
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:24,840
And to think that Tartarus
was once a favorite of King Zeus.

275
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:28,552
Until one day,
he offended the king and was banished.

276
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:33,599
He's been living in this forest
for thousands of years.

277
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,186
lt is said he poisons the trees,
and that the splinters are deadly.

278
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,147
If we go another way,
we'll lose time.

279
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:42,858
-But--
-He could have attacked us had he wanted.

280
00:37:42,942 --> 00:37:46,278
There's little else we can do but face him.
Wait here.

281
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:52,075
Urania, I’m scared.

282
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:53,702
I’m terrified.

283
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:59,434
-Show yourself!
-I’m here.

284
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:02,229
Let us cross the forest in peace.

285
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,694
I rule the world of the dead.

286
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,783
I have sent many a valiant soul
to Hades.

287
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,458
Did I frighten the son of Zeus?

288
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,258
You are doomed.

289
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:34,595
Die!

290
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:41,560
You will join my forest
of dangling souls.

291
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:45,230
-Where are you?
-Here.

292
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:48,525
Your death shall free the souls.

293
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:58,452
The third thunderbolt.

294
00:40:03,082 --> 00:40:05,375
All beings but us will perish...

295
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,545
and I shall regenerate mankind
to my own likeness.

296
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,797
I am chaos.

297
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:15,010
This sword of ice
has existed from the beginning of time.

298
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:18,388
And with it,
you will have the gods at your feet.

299
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:20,140
I will have the gods
at my feet.

300
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,770
Yes, Minos. This sword was forged
for Cronos at the time of creation.

301
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:26,938
And later,
when Zeus conquered Cronos...

302
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:31,068
I stole the sword
and hid it for this occasion.

303
00:40:31,402 --> 00:40:33,945
The gods have always
underestimated me, Dedalos.

304
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:36,448
And they will be punished
for it.

305
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:38,575
For the sake of my honor.

306
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:42,704
With this sword,
science shall triumph.

307
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:50,504
I give it to you now.
lt is to be used only once.

308
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:09,147
Beware, ye gods,
of the science of Minos.

309
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:14,486
Here we are.

310
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,198
That's the way to the Little People.
Through the ancient naos of Lacunt.

311
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:20,492
They see and hear
what we cannot.

312
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:22,911
-Then you'll wait here?
-Yes.

313
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:24,246
Good luck, Urania.

314
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,081
I won't be long.

315
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:47,227
Where the fires are high,
I invoke you, Klotho and Lachesis.

316
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:51,565
What brings thee here,
Urania?

317
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,942
You have made your choice.

318
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:58,196
You found Hercules,
and destiny is being fulfilled.

319
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:01,658
Yes, and we thank you for it,
and would ask you this:

320
00:42:01,743 --> 00:42:04,703
How can Hercules stand up to Antius
and not meet his death?

321
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:07,539
To your question,
we do know the answer.

322
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:11,918
But first, Urania, you must find
the one and only substance...

323
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:14,212
that can give protection
to man...

324
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:18,425
against the flames
of the fire monster, Antius.

325
00:42:18,593 --> 00:42:22,053
'Tis the healing secret balm
of Nomankril...

326
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:26,308
made out of drops of water
from the river Styx.

327
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,059
Where is it?

328
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:30,729
You and Hercules
must reach the sea...

329
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:33,815
and find there
the sanctuary of Thetis.

330
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,445
She will tell you what Hercules
and you must do to face Antius.

331
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:42,699
Fire can only be defeated
by water.

332
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:46,536
Yes, but how can we find her sanctuary
under such deep water?

333
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:50,665
You will have gills like fish
if you swallow these precious herbs...

334
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:53,710
and you'll breathe
like the inhabitants of the sea.

335
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:58,173
Take these golden leaves
of the consecrated gardens of Hespere.

336
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:12,062
Hercules, I’ve got the secret.

337
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:14,564
Tell me, how can we stop
the fire monster?

338
00:43:14,649 --> 00:43:16,358
-We'll have to journey.
-Where to?

339
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:20,111
-No, you must stay here, Glaucia.
-Don't you think we should stay together?

340
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:22,280
The Little People
speak in the name of Zeus...

341
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:24,157
and we will have to do
what they say.

342
00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:27,077
Their words reflect
the faithfulness of the gods.

343
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:29,079
They only speak the truth.

344
00:43:29,163 --> 00:43:32,040
lt is best, Glaucia.
Wait for us here.

345
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:34,835
-And don't worry.
-We'll not be long.

346
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,097
You say the Little People
spoke of Thetis and a sea kingdom?

347
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:50,517
Yes, and the door to it
lies below there.

348
00:43:50,768 --> 00:43:52,686
That's many leagues
beneath the sea.

349
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:56,481
We needn't fear.
We shall breathe like water creatures...

350
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:59,985
thanks to this.
The Little People gave them to me.

351
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:03,530
-Well, what is that?
-Time is short. Take it.

352
00:44:05,032 --> 00:44:08,785
Didn't you say
the Little People always spoke the truth?

353
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:56,166
Look there.

354
00:44:58,628 --> 00:45:02,088
Yes. It's the temple of Thetis,
the Nereid.

355
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:30,867
Welcome, my friends.

356
00:45:30,952 --> 00:45:34,162
Do not be alarmed.
You don't see me speak...

357
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:36,957
but you hear the projection
of my thought.

358
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,751
You've come in the name of Zeus.
I know.

359
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:42,504
We have very little time,
and we need your help.

360
00:45:42,588 --> 00:45:44,965
It shall not be denied.

361
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:48,259
The sacred balm
the Little People spoke to you about...

362
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:51,554
was made with three drops
taken from the river Styx...

363
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,682
that flows through Hades.

364
00:45:53,808 --> 00:45:58,311
If you spread the balm from head to toe,
you shall, for a short while...

365
00:45:58,437 --> 00:46:03,149
resist the incinerating flames of Antius,
the fire monster.

366
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:08,989
If I am able to resist the heat
for the time it takes to discover his secret...

367
00:46:09,073 --> 00:46:10,949
then Phagesta will be free.

368
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:14,995
Yes, the maidens of Phagesta
shall be free of danger...

369
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:16,788
but not for long.

370
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:22,711
The thunderbolts that were stolen from Zeus
have caused havoc in the skies.

371
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:28,133
The moon no longer obeys the earth.
The tides have swollen the seas.

372
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:30,802
You must find
the remaining thunderbolts...

373
00:46:30,886 --> 00:46:33,304
or our planet
shall surely be crushed.

374
00:46:33,431 --> 00:46:36,016
-We'll be crushed?
-The moon.

375
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,018
Yes. It is coming upon us.

376
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:42,856
The meridians have been changed.
Unless cosmic balance is reestablished...

377
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,151
it will mean the annihilation
of all living things...

378
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:47,902
perhaps even the gods.

379
00:46:48,029 --> 00:46:51,364
We cannot let this happen.
We must stop it now.

380
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:53,700
Hercules and Urania...

381
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:58,163
you hold the fate of all
that has been created in your hands.

382
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:02,042
I give you the sacred balm
you have come for.

383
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:07,589
Go, and face the fire monster
at once.

384
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:14,763
-Are you all right?
-Yes, let's go.

385
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:27,275
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

386
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:29,402
Glaucia?

387
00:47:39,121 --> 00:47:41,372
Would she have gone around
that point?

388
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:44,459
But it's not like her.
It's strange.

389
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,009
Look there.

390
00:48:01,852 --> 00:48:03,394
It's a shield.

391
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:16,407
I know this shield.

392
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:18,451
Whose is it?

393
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:22,413
lt belongs to the High Priest
and to his soldiers.

394
00:48:22,748 --> 00:48:25,041
The priest who invokes
the fire monster.

395
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:27,836
That means they came here to get her
and to sacrifice her!

396
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,422
They can't be far ahead of us.
We'll reach her in time.

397
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:35,051
Great gods,
don't let me die. I beg!

398
00:48:35,136 --> 00:48:38,805
Please, help me.

399
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:41,432
No, don't let me die!

400
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:44,853
I invoke thee, Antius...

401
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:48,106
Lord of Fire.

402
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,276
We offer you
the last daughter of Phagesta.

403
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,281
Come! Here is your victim.

404
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,085
It's ghastly.

405
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:19,971
It's hell. Hell on earth!

406
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:21,890
Take it away!

407
00:49:25,978 --> 00:49:27,770
No!

408
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:33,234
It's Antius.

409
00:49:38,199 --> 00:50:46,862
-I am ready for you!
-Hercules!

410
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:23,970
Antius is dead.
We've been set free.

411
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:26,806
Hercules has found
the fourth lightning bolt.

412
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:30,018
-But this is only the beginning.
-The beginning?

413
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:32,186
We are rid of the monster.

414
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:36,524
The problem is not just Antius.
Our Mother Earth is in great danger...

415
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,110
and mankind will perish...

416
00:51:39,194 --> 00:51:43,197
unless we can help Hercules
find the three remaining thunderbolts.

417
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:49,954
I think Minos is up to his old tricks again.
Always experimenting.

418
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:54,417
We did not rebel against Zeus
only to join forces with disaster.

419
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:57,503
No. We rebelled against Zeus...

420
00:51:57,588 --> 00:52:00,214
-to be free, completely free.
-Yes.

421
00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:03,718
Should he succeed in collecting
all his thunderbolts...

422
00:52:03,802 --> 00:52:05,887
Zeus will be back in full force.

423
00:52:05,971 --> 00:52:08,306
Why hasn't Minos
stopped him yet?

424
00:52:08,515 --> 00:52:10,975
Minos doesn't need
our advice.

425
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,562
The clashing of these two enemies
is unavoidable.

426
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:18,066
Minos is preparing
a nice little surprise for Hercules.

427
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,318
-ls he?
-At this very moment.

428
00:52:21,195 --> 00:52:24,072
Meanwhile,
Flora is keeping Minos in check.

429
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:26,991
Yes. In fact he asked
that I appear before him.

430
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:30,620
Perhaps the three of us should appear.
He's diabolically clever.

431
00:52:30,704 --> 00:52:34,040
But Flora's the one
who brought him back from eternal sleep.

432
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:37,251
-He seems to trust her most.
-He trusts no one.

433
00:52:37,336 --> 00:52:39,253
Let us hope for the best.

434
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:42,590
-The stars be with you, Flora.
-Thank you, Hera.

435
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:11,035
You're late
in answering my call.

436
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,329
The gods have done
what you wanted...

437
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:15,706
yet Hercules succeeds
in his mission.

438
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:19,585
He's found four thunderbolts,
while you, you just disappear.

439
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:24,215
-You're acting as though you were a god.
-I am much more than a god, Flora.

440
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:26,134
You're mad, Minos.

441
00:53:26,218 --> 00:53:28,511
The time has come
to dissolve the bond...

442
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:32,306
that ties me with foolish gods
unworthy of my talents.

443
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,686
Those gods will annihilate you, Minos.
Be careful.

444
00:53:37,312 --> 00:53:41,149
Your concern for me is touching,
especially since it comes...

445
00:53:41,275 --> 00:53:44,444
at the moment
when you should be afraid for yourself.

446
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:46,904
Flora, Goddess of Spring...

447
00:53:47,781 --> 00:53:50,867
I deliver you
into the land of frost...

448
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:53,161
of ice!

449
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:18,311
The Little People
used to appear in this temple...

450
00:54:18,395 --> 00:54:21,189
before the fire monster
destroyed it.

451
00:54:22,316 --> 00:54:24,817
If only I can call them back.

452
00:54:27,738 --> 00:54:29,530
What is it, Urania?

453
00:54:31,283 --> 00:54:33,534
I feel another presence.

454
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,913
It's strange, as if....

455
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:43,127
Urania, are you certain
this is the place?

456
00:54:43,337 --> 00:54:46,714
The temple has always meant a lot
to the Little People.

457
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,384
I’ve always talked to them,
but now I can't feel their presence.

458
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:53,554
There is another way,
although it's difficult and very dangerous.

459
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:55,973
-How is that?
-I shall consult an oracle.

460
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:58,351
-What oracle?
-The oracle of death.

461
00:54:58,435 --> 00:55:00,269
Let me go now.
I’ll be back.

462
00:55:00,354 --> 00:55:03,773
-Why the oracle of death?
-The Little People are spirits.

463
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:08,110
They're not of this world.
Have faith in me, Hercules, and wait for me.

464
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:24,585
Take this magic potion
in your hands...

465
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:27,547
and transmit
your thought to me.

466
00:55:28,298 --> 00:55:30,091
I shall hear it.

467
00:55:31,176 --> 00:55:35,513
Sweet oracle of death,
help me to reach the Little People.

468
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:38,432
Drink the potion.

469
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:06,961
We are sorry we couldn't come to you,
dear Urania.

470
00:56:07,045 --> 00:56:10,464
But the earth is a difficult place,
even for spirits.

471
00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:13,634
It's much safer here
in the astral world...

472
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:17,054
next to the stars,
moons, and planets.

473
00:56:23,186 --> 00:56:26,105
They say
there is chaos here, too.

474
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:30,359
Where shall we ever take
our poor spirits?

475
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:17,114
We know that
you have come here, Urania...

476
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,077
to find out where the goddess Hera
and her rebellious sisters...

477
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:23,621
have hidden the rest
of Zeus' thunderbolts.

478
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:26,165
Not even the gods have secrets from us.

479
00:57:26,249 --> 00:57:30,127
We could tell you where they are,
but your search will be extremely difficult.

480
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:33,923
You've been chosen
to help Hercules retrieve the thunderbolts...

481
00:57:34,049 --> 00:57:36,967
but you weren't told
of the risks that are involved.

482
00:57:37,052 --> 00:57:41,097
Zeus knows that for universal peace,
you are ready to sacrifice all.

483
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:43,391
Yes. lt will mean your life.

484
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:53,943
There's something strange
about this old temple.

485
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:55,903
Urania and I
have been here before.

486
00:57:55,987 --> 00:57:59,240
-And she'd come to consult the oracle?
-Yes.

487
00:57:59,866 --> 00:58:02,493
She inherited her powers
from her mother.

488
00:58:02,994 --> 00:58:05,913
Her adopted mother.
A priestess of Corinth.

489
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:08,207
-And her father?
-We don't know.

490
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:13,087
But when her mother died,
she was taken in by my parents in Phagesta.

491
00:58:13,171 --> 00:58:16,006
-And they've since died?
-We have had a hard life.

492
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:19,176
And that is why Urania
and I are so close.

493
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:23,514
My family and ancestors
had lived in Phagesta since time forgotten.

494
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:27,226
But after Antius descended upon us,
all changed.

495
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:30,438
Now we only live
to defend ourselves. We're....

496
00:58:32,482 --> 00:58:35,067
-What was that?
-What did you hear?

497
00:58:35,235 --> 00:58:38,904
Something that came
from that direction.

498
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:44,201
Are you certain, Glaucia?

499
00:58:45,871 --> 00:58:47,872
Well, I thought I did.

500
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:53,502
I already told you
I had my misgivings.

501
00:59:03,138 --> 00:59:07,892
-Who are these people?
-Women warriors. The Amazons of Scythia.

502
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:21,655
Be careful of the queen, Hercules.
She is the most evil of all.

503
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:12,414
The net.
Lower the net on him!

504
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:28,138
-What will we do with her?
-We'll come back for her later.

505
01:00:28,223 --> 01:00:29,265
Yes, Captain.

506
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:58,168
Rise, Your Majesty.

507
01:00:59,129 --> 01:01:01,380
Rise up from the fires,
my queen.

508
01:01:01,464 --> 01:01:04,842
Rise, and let your burning flesh
melt together...

509
01:01:05,552 --> 01:01:07,928
with the body of your victim.

510
01:01:16,813 --> 01:01:21,775
You've a choice prize in your net,
O Queen of Spiders.

511
01:01:27,782 --> 01:01:29,158
Hercules.

512
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:33,871
Hercules awaits you, my queen.

513
01:01:37,918 --> 01:01:39,585
Go. Leave me.

514
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:11,575
Urania!

515
01:02:14,746 --> 01:02:17,623
Glaucia, what happened?
You've bruised your head.

516
01:02:17,707 --> 01:02:20,084
We've been attacked.
And they took Hercules.

517
01:02:20,168 --> 01:02:22,795
And they left me there,
thinking that I was dead.

518
01:02:22,879 --> 01:02:24,088
Who did it?

519
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:27,341
-While fighting the Amazons.
-The Spider Queen.

520
01:02:27,425 --> 01:02:31,470
Yes. He is at her mercy,
caught in her magnetic web.

521
01:02:36,393 --> 01:02:40,187
She's a monster
who has assumed the likeness of a human.

522
01:02:40,522 --> 01:02:42,398
There's little we can do, Urania.

523
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:47,945
I call to thee,
powers of light...

524
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:52,491
transfer unto Hercules
thy energy to win.

525
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:58,998
Her love is evil.
He must kill her, or he will die.

526
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:49,006
The fifth thunderbolt.
I deliver it to you, Zeus.

527
01:04:02,437 --> 01:04:05,397
The goddess Hera
was the instrument of my return to earth...

528
01:04:05,482 --> 01:04:08,942
but not the cause.
Fate needed me here.

529
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:12,362
Now Dedalos, this is surely...

530
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:15,657
an important moment
for science.

531
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:20,287
For me, the goal of science
is to release chaos and disorder.

532
01:04:20,371 --> 01:04:21,538
Dedalos...

533
01:04:21,998 --> 01:04:25,793
make me the ally of trickery,
and of chaos.

534
01:04:27,587 --> 01:04:29,546
lt will serve you well.

535
01:04:35,053 --> 01:04:39,056
I bestow cunning,
connivance, and chaos.

536
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:51,026
We four gods are doomed, Hera.

537
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:54,488
lt was a grave mistake
to rebel against Zeus.

538
01:04:54,572 --> 01:04:55,948
Poseidon is right.

539
01:04:56,032 --> 01:04:58,534
Hercules has discovered
the fifth thunderbolt...

540
01:04:58,618 --> 01:05:00,661
and soon Zeus
will shatter Minos.

541
01:05:00,745 --> 01:05:04,873
No. Hercules cannot compete with Minos.
His science is invincible.

542
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:08,919
And once Hercules is defeated,
we shall rid ourselves of Minos.

543
01:05:09,045 --> 01:05:11,505
Invincible?
Not from the looks of things.

544
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:14,258
Flora was instantly felled
by the sword of ice.

545
01:05:14,342 --> 01:05:18,846
You carry on so,
and yet would consider yourselves gods.

546
01:05:18,972 --> 01:05:22,182
You're like ordinary mortals.
Without dignity.

547
01:05:26,813 --> 01:05:29,148
Yes, without dignity.

548
01:05:30,024 --> 01:05:34,611
Science and chaos have given me
the power to eliminate you all.

549
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:45,080
Flee, Aphrodite. Hera!

550
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:10,063
Beware, Minos.

551
01:06:12,734 --> 01:06:16,820
Beware of what?
Of your quivering frame?

552
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:22,659
A goddess in my power.

553
01:06:24,078 --> 01:06:28,957
You did not conquer us.
I admit we were all divided by jealousy.

554
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:31,793
But Zeus will have his day.

555
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:37,966
Zeus is nil
without his thunderbolts.

556
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:41,637
And with Hercules' help,
they'll all soon be mine.

557
01:06:41,721 --> 01:06:45,557
-He'll not agree to that.
-No, you're wrong, my dear Hera.

558
01:06:45,642 --> 01:06:49,019
Hercules works for me,
though he's not aware of it.

559
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:52,814
But now you shall tell me
where the last thunderbolt is hidden.

560
01:06:54,776 --> 01:06:57,277
-Never.
-I can wait.

561
01:06:58,363 --> 01:07:01,073
Never is only
a question of time.

562
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,076
-Follow me.
-Where does this lead?

563
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,579
To the edge of the world.
But we needn't fear, Hercules.

564
01:07:07,664 --> 01:07:10,040
Then these are the wastelands
of Hesperia...

565
01:07:10,124 --> 01:07:13,126
the last bulwark
before ascending Mt. Olympus.

566
01:07:14,212 --> 01:07:17,839
-Our destiny takes us up through there.
-Then lead on.

567
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:22,886
There are still two thunderbolts
for you to uncover, Hercules.

568
01:07:23,137 --> 01:07:26,848
Be patient, my son.
I shall guide you to them.

569
01:07:33,606 --> 01:07:35,565
Where are we now?

570
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:37,985
Quiet.

571
01:07:39,153 --> 01:07:41,488
We're in the Temple of Echoes...

572
01:07:41,572 --> 01:07:44,950
where the words of men
reflect those of the gods...

573
01:07:45,451 --> 01:07:48,954
where everything reflects itself.

574
01:08:21,446 --> 01:08:25,073
Look there.
The reflected light of a thunderbolt.

575
01:08:25,742 --> 01:08:28,118
The foolish gods have repented.

576
01:08:29,245 --> 01:08:31,663
Yes, the gods have been graced.

577
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:38,378
Now, Zeus,
it's time to crush the forces of chaos.

578
01:08:38,796 --> 01:08:42,632
The time to fulfill our destinies.

579
01:08:56,981 --> 01:08:58,106
Glaucia!

580
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:03,195
One move, and she dies.
The moment of truth is here.

581
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:06,865
I’m not who you think I am.
Glaucia is dead.

582
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:10,660
Yes, thanks to Glaucia,
I knew you revery move, Hercules.

583
01:09:10,745 --> 01:09:13,038
Now that you've found
the sixth thunderbolt...

584
01:09:13,122 --> 01:09:15,540
it's time we faced each other.

585
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,667
Minos, not again.

586
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:22,172
Yes, I’m back,
thanks to the gods.

587
01:09:23,132 --> 01:09:26,510
Actually,
I’ve been back for a while.

588
01:09:27,136 --> 01:09:31,598
From that time at that lonely beach
when you lost sight of Glaucia. Remember?

589
01:09:31,682 --> 01:09:35,018
I had called upon Poseidon,
and he commanded that the waters...

590
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,104
drain the life
out of the real Glaucia.

591
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,546
It's not possible.
How can it be?

592
01:10:03,881 --> 01:10:06,800
We created an exact replica
of the original.

593
01:10:06,884 --> 01:10:09,511
Better than the original,
at least for us.

594
01:10:11,764 --> 01:10:16,059
Her emotional and mental responses
appear to be the same.

595
01:10:16,144 --> 01:10:19,729
But we scientifically altered
the course of her destiny.

596
01:10:19,814 --> 01:10:23,024
She was not aware of it
until this very moment.

597
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:27,320
Hercules, there's no need
for us to fight.

598
01:10:28,114 --> 01:10:31,783
With the aid of chaos, I have subdued
the gods who rebelled against Zeus.

599
01:10:31,868 --> 01:10:34,411
Alone, without the full array
of his thunderbolts...

600
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,746
Zeus is no match for chaos.

601
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:40,959
The future belongs to chaos,
and to science.

602
01:10:43,004 --> 01:10:45,172
Join us, Hercules. Come.

603
01:10:45,673 --> 01:10:47,674
-Never.
-Very well.

604
01:10:54,807 --> 01:10:59,478
Those foolish gods wanted him destroyed.
Instead, I shall use him.

605
01:11:00,146 --> 01:11:04,191
Can you imagine a mankind
created in his image...

606
01:11:04,775 --> 01:11:07,194
but scientifically programmed?

607
01:11:07,653 --> 01:11:09,154
No error.

608
01:11:12,074 --> 01:11:14,284
Glaucia, my dear...

609
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,163
we no longer need you.

610
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:21,041
Get rid of yourself.

611
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:39,100
Excellent.

612
01:11:39,185 --> 01:11:42,354
I’m sure, Urania,
you know the way.

613
01:11:45,316 --> 01:11:48,276
One must accept
inevitable defeat.

614
01:11:48,736 --> 01:11:51,655
I can only accept it
as a challenge, Minos.

615
01:11:54,242 --> 01:11:55,909
Very amusing.

616
01:12:13,761 --> 01:12:17,389
You are viewing my sacred domain,
dear Dedalos.

617
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:21,560
I’m simply returning the favor.

618
01:12:21,644 --> 01:12:25,272
No, you can do nothing, Zeus,
for though you are the light...

619
01:12:25,356 --> 01:12:28,358
I am the darkness.
Thus, we are alike.

620
01:12:28,442 --> 01:12:30,402
Except for one thing.

621
01:12:30,987 --> 01:12:35,156
I possess time,
for I am the son of Cronos.

622
01:12:37,451 --> 01:12:39,995
Father Time!

623
01:13:21,078 --> 01:13:23,038
I have failed, Athena...

624
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:25,707
and allowed Minos to trick me.

625
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:32,589
It's yours, Hercules.

626
01:13:37,428 --> 01:13:41,931
This shield will protect you from Minos,
and evil science.

627
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:45,101
But only
if you can save yourself.

628
01:13:45,186 --> 01:13:47,812
The moon shall crush the earth
if Minos has his way.

629
01:13:47,897 --> 01:13:52,150
He will sacrifice us all
so as to reign in the name of chaos.

630
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,614
Go onto Olympic skies.

631
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:02,869
I’ve the gods
in the palm of my hand.

632
01:14:02,953 --> 01:14:07,082
My science has turned pure energy
into battling warriors.

633
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:11,294
But we have the greatest warrior
of all time, Minos.

634
01:14:15,966 --> 01:14:18,635
Suddenly you're for Hercules.

635
01:14:21,138 --> 01:14:24,349
We doubt he can change
the Earth's course.

636
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:25,809
Watch this.

637
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:20,989
There's one thing your magic shield
won't protect you from, Hercules.

638
01:15:21,115 --> 01:15:22,490
Pure energy.

639
01:15:27,663 --> 01:15:29,497
Cosmic light.

640
01:15:35,171 --> 01:15:37,130
The sun's fire.

641
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:40,675
Take this, Hercules.

642
01:15:44,472 --> 01:15:49,100
lt is of the same energy,
and you shall be infused with it.

643
01:15:49,685 --> 01:18:04,635
You are the heart and the force
of the universe.

644
01:18:24,798 --> 01:18:28,509
Minos challenged the universe
and the very secret of life.

645
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,221
His savagery
has been cancelled.

646
01:18:32,973 --> 01:18:38,061
The maiden Urania is free
and the goddess Hera has repented.

647
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:42,690
Hercules did what no other man
could have done.

648
01:18:42,816 --> 01:18:45,568
But danger
still lurks in the skies.

649
01:18:45,653 --> 01:18:49,864
lt could all be resolved
by finding the last thunderbolt.

650
01:18:50,324 --> 01:18:53,826
The oracles say
it was hidden up here on Olympus.

651
01:18:53,994 --> 01:18:58,081
But that's not so.
How can the oracles lie?

652
01:18:58,165 --> 01:19:00,083
lt is here.

653
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:03,336
Your secret
was revealed to me.

654
01:19:03,837 --> 01:19:05,755
You, Hera, are my mother...

655
01:19:05,839 --> 01:19:09,425
and you hid the last thunderbolt
within me.

656
01:19:10,511 --> 01:19:12,095
ln my heart.

657
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:17,976
And I am
the final hiding place.

658
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:21,646
You're my mother, Hera.

659
01:19:22,982 --> 01:19:24,649
Yes, it's true.

660
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:28,987
I created you from light
and I breathed life into you.

661
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,116
I had you formed
with beauty and goodness...

662
01:19:33,242 --> 01:19:36,411
but only to conceal
what was hidden within you.

663
01:19:36,495 --> 01:19:39,664
Yet, I grew fond of you
and often asked myself:

664
01:19:40,332 --> 01:19:43,835
''Can she....
Would she ever feel love for me?''

665
01:19:46,046 --> 01:19:47,380
And now....

666
01:19:49,842 --> 01:19:53,469
And now, Mother, you must do
what fate demands of you.

667
01:19:56,015 --> 01:19:58,057
I gave you life, my child.

668
01:19:58,142 --> 01:20:01,019
I never thought
I would have to take it from you.

669
01:20:01,186 --> 01:20:03,187
-You must.
-Please don't.

670
01:20:03,897 --> 01:20:06,899
Mother, there's little time.

671
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:08,651
-But isn't there--
-Hurry.

672
01:20:08,736 --> 01:20:11,612
How else can we save the world,
my child?

673
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:17,326
Mother, give me
the kiss of death.

674
01:20:26,962 --> 01:20:28,463
Or love...

675
01:20:30,132 --> 01:21:37,752
my beloved daughter.

676
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,286
Chaos has been defeated.

677
01:21:42,913 --> 01:21:45,498
But if another threat arises...

678
01:21:45,582 --> 01:21:48,209
the Earth is surely doomed.

679
01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:50,628
Can mankind
withstand the dangers?

680
01:21:50,754 --> 01:21:53,840
Only our fear can defeat us.

681
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:57,385
-Man always finds a way to conquer.
-Not without the gods.

682
01:21:57,469 --> 01:21:59,679
But I am here, am I not?

683
01:21:59,763 --> 01:22:03,224
How can a man stop the Earth
from colliding with the moon?

684
01:22:03,308 --> 01:22:07,061
The way Atlantis did
at the beginning of time.

685
01:22:07,146 --> 01:22:11,774
My new found powers
shall belong to him: Hercules.

686
01:22:12,943 --> 01:22:14,527
Grow, Hercules.

687
01:22:34,673 --> 01:22:37,717
Hercules, block the moon.

688
01:22:39,052 --> 01:22:40,970
Stop the Earth.

689
01:22:41,305 --> 01:23:49,467
Save mankind!

690
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:10,685
Now order is reestablished.

691
01:24:14,064 --> 01:24:18,567
You sacrificed what was dearest to you
to save the universe.

692
01:24:18,652 --> 01:24:20,778
And so, I forgive you.

693
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:24,949
And forgive those gods
who had lost faith and rebelled against me.

694
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:29,036
Let peace reign again and forever
on Olympus...

695
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:30,913
and on earth.

696
01:24:30,998 --> 01:24:34,417
So be it for evermore.

697
01:24:34,751 --> 01:24:39,255
To reward you for your sacrifice,
and Urania for hers...

698
01:24:40,632 --> 01:24:43,759
I decree that she become
one of the Muses...

699
01:24:44,303 --> 01:24:47,680
granting wisdom
from this time on to man...

700
01:24:47,764 --> 01:24:49,598
and to the gods.

701
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,312
Urania, goddess and Muse
of space...

702
01:24:54,396 --> 01:24:56,355
patron of astrology.

703
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:00,776
And you, too, Hercules...

704
01:25:01,153 --> 01:25:04,655
greatest of men
and savior of the universe...

705
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,825
you, too, shall dwell
among the immortal gods.

706
01:25:08,869 --> 01:25:12,830
And the example of your courage
will shine in the heavens...

707
01:25:12,914 --> 01:27:26,029
till the end of time.
