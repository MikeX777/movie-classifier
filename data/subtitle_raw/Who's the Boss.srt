["FunMi Lowo" by Aramide plays]

4
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:22,000
[narrator]<i> Families all over Nigeria chose</i>
<i>Coca-Cola because we know what matters.</i>

5
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,875
{\an8}<i>Coca-Cola, putting families first.</i>

6
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:32,792
{\an8}And we leave them happy,
and secure, enjoying the beverage.

7
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,417
{\an8}[Liah]<i> This is Hauwa Ashinwole,</i>
<i>one of the greatest</i>

8
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,958
{\an8}<i>advertising executives and my boss.</i>

9
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,833
{\an8}This is the campaign
we've been looking for.

10
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,875
{\an8}What do you call it?

11
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,083
{\an8}Family first campaign.

12
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,833
{\an8}[Liah]<i> That's me, Liah. The one in yellow.</i>

13
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,708
{\an8}<i>And today is the most</i>
<i>important day of my life.</i>

14
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:55,000
{\an8}<i>Today, after two years,</i>
<i>I am finally going to be promoted.</i>

15
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,042
Now, this is what we've been looking for.

16
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,375
Okay, what you'll do is send the paperwork
over to my office.

17
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,875
Okay, then. Thank you.

18
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,917
-Okay, shall we? Let us go.
-Alright, have a nice day.

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Um... you were right.

20
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,583
It's a beautiful idea.

21
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,000
[sighs]
Thank you, ma'am.

22
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,417
Um, your refinement made the difference.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,208
Fine. Take my bag.

24
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:35,333
[Liah]<i> After today,</i>
<i>no more assistant work for me.</i>

25
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,750
<i>Alright, Liah, it's time</i>
<i>to ask the question.</i>

26
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,792
Spit it out, Liah.

27
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,875
Is it about the senior creative
executive role?

28
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,083
You were a corper two years ago.

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,667
And you're technically still an assistant.

30
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:00,542
Listen,

31
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,083
that role is four places above
your current grade.

32
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:09,500
So you don't think I'm ready?

33
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,708
Senior creatives run their own briefs.

34
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,250
Their own clients,
effectively independent.

35
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,625
The question is, are you ready?

36
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,917
[Liah]<i> Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>my boss is a bit of a bitch.</i>

37
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,167
<i>This is Apex, where I work.</i>

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,833
<i>And that's Tunde Esan, my boss' boss.</i>

39
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,292
[laughs]
What an attack.

40
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,875
Wawu!

41
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,458
-Sorry, I'm just dealing with something.
-[Liah]<i> And that's Jumoke, my best friend.</i>

42
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,125
Lekan sent me a dwarf.

43
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,958
A what? Like, why would
he even do that?

44
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,833
You know what?
Please, never mind.

45
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,208
That's your friend.

46
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,042
Um, I was calling to ask about the grant.

47
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,208
Have you heard back?

48
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Um... it's my birthday,
I'm trying not to think about it.

49
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,250
[sighs]
Alright, then. Fine.

50
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,667
-Don't be late. Okay?
-I won't be late.

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,917
Happy birthday, boo.
[chuckles]

52
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,458
Bye. [chuckles]

53
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,458
[phone beeps]

54
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,333
[sighs]

55
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:11,500
Hauwa, look, why don't we
just promote this girl already?

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,583
She's too good to be an assistant.

57
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,750
Okay.

58
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,125
Promote her to creative executive.

59
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,083
-[Liah]<i> What?</i>
-Come on, you would rather

60
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,167
promote her to creative executive,
not senior creative executive?

61
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,875
Tunde, she hasn't earned it.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,708
But she's done the job.

63
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:31,000
Look, would you rather she gets
impatient and leaves?

64
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,250
Then you'll get the next person I train.

65
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,250
Hmm...

66
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,833
-Interesting.
-Yeah.

67
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,208
-[laughs]
-Later.

68
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,500
[Liah]<i> Oh, shit!</i>

69
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,042
[Hauwa] Liah?

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
Are you still in there?

71
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,125
Liah?

72
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,417
Are you purging?

73
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,458
I told you not to take those small chops.

74
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:02,042
Small chops? I'll give you small chops!

75
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:06,125
-I will give you small chops!
-[gagging]

76
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:11,000
Small chops that you have been giving me.

77
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,417
[choking]

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,750
[Hauwa] Are you still in there?

79
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,125
[sobs] Yes, Hauwa.

80
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,542
[breathes shakily]

81
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,292
Hurry up and finish.

82
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,292
[breathes shakily, sniffs]

83
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,750
Goldmyne has finally sent the brief.

84
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,292
You have to prepare the concept,
so we can show it to Tunde tomorrow.

85
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,417
Okay?

86
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
[Liah sobs]

87
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,500
-Yes, Hauwa, of course, Hauwa.
-Hurry up.

88
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,875
[sobbing]

89
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,417
[breathes out, sniffs]

90
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,708
[sniffs]

91
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,042
[breathes out, sniffs]

92
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,500
[Liah]<i> And that's Lekan.</i>

93
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,167
<i>Jumoke's, ugh... friend.</i>

94
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,417
[phone rings]

95
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,417
[Lekan sighs]

96
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,542
Jumes!

97
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,250
Hey, dear.

98
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,333
[Jumoke] A dwarf?

99
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,833
There's a dwarf at my clinic.

100
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,792
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

101
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,083
I'm sure those pregnant women
have seen a dwarf before now.

102
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,417
Or at least a child,
which looks like a dwarf.

103
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,917
Are you serious right now?

104
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,000
[Pidgin]
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

105
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,375
[in English]<i> Jumes, it's difficult</i>
<i>to give you birthday gifts,</i>

106
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,708
you're too rich!

107
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,958
So imagine my luck when I remembered
that you like dancing dwarfs!

108
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,375
I was six!

109
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,750
And that was Snow White.

110
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,042
You don't like dancing dwarfs anymore?

111
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,750
[sighs] Are you coming tonight?

112
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,500
Of course now, it's your birthday.

113
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,417
Where will I be?

114
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,208
<i>Good. So I can kill you.</i>

115
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,750
[laughs]

116
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,125
Aren't you one of his actors?

117
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,917
Ugh, why would you even agree to do this?

118
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,333
I lost a bet.

119
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,583
[Lekan] So...

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,875
where were we?

121
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,208
Dear? Birthday?

122
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,083
I don't do married men.

123
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,458
Neither do I.

124
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,500
[woman] Hmm...

125
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,333
That was my best friend.

126
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,292
[woman] Hmm...

127
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,167
[Lekan]<i> My chairman.</i>

128
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,875
I have agreed to do this.

129
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,917
I have agreed to go
and study for three years.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,042
But surely...

131
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,625
there's a problem!

132
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,458
I mean,

133
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,500
to be without a woman...

134
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,417
eh?

135
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,125
For three years!

136
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:30,917
Ha!

137
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,458
Surely not!

138
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,083
[laughter]

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,167
To fast...

140
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,333
once a week...

141
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,708
for three years.

142
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,542
My chairman, surely not.

143
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,500
[laughter]

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,292
To eat one meal a day,

145
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,000
when I'm not fasting,

146
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,708
for three years!

147
00:08:58,542 --> 00:08:59,375
Ah!

148
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,917
My chairman, surely not.

149
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,333
[laughter]

150
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,792
And on top of that...

151
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,000
sleep only three hours...

152
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,833
a day for three years!

153
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,125
So, wait.

154
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,625
No food...

155
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,292
no sleep...

156
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,083
no woman...

157
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,083
for three years!

158
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,167
[in Pidgin] Come on, chairman,
think about it, surely not.

159
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,500
[laughter]

160
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,333
[in English] Surely, yes.

161
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,125
You swore.

162
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,667
It is done.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,667
-[laughter]
-[applause]

164
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,542
[cheering]

165
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,958
[party music playing]

166
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,667
It's my birthday party!

167
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,125
[cheering]

168
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,417
Liah!

169
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,333
What took you so long?

170
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,208
What's wrong?

171
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,333
Talk.

172
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,917
Can't I even get a drink?

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,583
Fine.

174
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,042
[chuckles]

175
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,625
So I walked in on Hauwa and Tunde
having a conversation

176
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,500
and she basically sabotaged my promotion.

177
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,042
Wait, what do you mean
she sabotaged your promotion?

178
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,542
She blatantly told him I wasn't ready.

179
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,708
What?

180
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,000
She's such a bitch!

181
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,583
Well...

182
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,708
-in her defense...
-No, don't you dare defend her.

183
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,833
You have to quit your job.

184
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:22,583
And harvest money from the tree
that grows in whose backyard?

185
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,292
-I mean, I could always just--
-No, you would not!

186
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,000
-Liah, I don't--
-No!

187
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,458
So what are you going to do now?

188
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,042
I don't know, I'm learning so much
from Hauwa, she actually is the best--

189
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,292
-Wait.
-[phone ringing]

190
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,958
[Lekan]<i> Where are you?</i>

191
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,833
Where am I? Where are you?

192
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,667
You're supposed to be at my party.

193
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,792
<i>I am.</i>

194
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,583
[Jumoke] I can't see you.

195
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,875
<i>I'm throwing a party for you at mine.</i>

196
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,625
You're crazy.

197
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,333
<i>And you're missing out.</i>

198
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,583
<i>Get over here!</i>

199
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,708
[laughs] He's crazy.

200
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,417
-Who's that?
-[inhales sharply] Lekan.

201

[music continues]

207
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,667
[Jumoke] You have to be kidding me!

208
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,167
Lekan, what is this?

209
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,667
Jumes!

210
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,583
Go, go, go!

211
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,750
You said this was my party!

212
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,917
Well, it is now!

213
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,458
It looks like a prelude
to a freaking orgy!

214
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,167
Let's go upstairs, let's go upstairs.
Upstairs is saner!

215
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,417
Get up. Get more shots, of course.

216
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,417
Okay, sorry, now,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

217
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,750
Go, go, go!

218
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,667
Sorry, now!

219
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,125
I'll meet you upstairs! I'll meet you!
I'll meet you! I'll meet you!

220
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,167
[party music fades]

221
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,333
[indistinct shouting]

222
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:55,833
[sighs]

223
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,333
[moaning]

224
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,000
[screams]

225
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,250
[chuckles]
I wasn't expecting anyone to be here.

226
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,542
It's your house.
You have a bedroom.

227
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,042
This is your house?

228
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,708
I thought you said you're from America!

229
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,917
Is your name even Charlie?

230
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,125
Asshole!

231
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,667
Thank you, cock blocker.

232
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,667
Why are you even lying about
something like that?

233
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,917
She felt like a gold-digger.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,208
So then what is she doing here?

235
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,292
Because she looked like that.

236
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,083
And that's my book.

237
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,875
[scoffs] Finally,
I've been looking all over for you.

238
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,500
-Hey, Lekan.
-Hey.

239
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,750
I have someone I want you to meet.

240
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,208
[scoffs]
God, no, not that!

241
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,333
-It's about work.
-Oh, okay.

242
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,250
-Bye, Lekan.
-Bye.

243
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,125
-[man laughs]
-[Jumoke] So... tell her what you told me.

244
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,167
The worst pitch ever story.

245
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,667
Oh! [laughs]

246
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,208
So, this one time at my office,
we have this--

247
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,875
No, not that part.

248
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,083
The part about you agreeing
to have my friend pitch you an ad.

249
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,167
I did?

250
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,583
You totally did.

251
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,625
[laughing]

252
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,833
-[laughs]
-Oh, I-- I guess I did then.

253
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:29,833
-[laughs]
-Good.

254
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,833
So just enter it into your calendar
for you and your boss. Okay?

255
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,458
-Jumoke, what are you doing?
-Okay.

256
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:35,375
Shhh...

257
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,542
[chuckles]

258
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,000
[typing in phone]

259
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,125
Umm...

260
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,625
-Perfect.
-[chuckles]

261
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:48,250
So Francis is the EA
to the chief marketing officer

262
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,417
-of Cars45.
-[Liah] Hmm...

263
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,000
And he just set up
a meeting with his boss.

264
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,708
-For me?
-Yeah.

265
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,125
-Amazing!
-[Jumoke] I know!

266
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,167
Hauwa will be so thrilled
when I tell her about this.

267
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,083
[laughs]

268
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
[Jumoke]<i> Hell, no!</i>

269
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,458
So you actually think
I did this for Hauwa?

270
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,167
Jumoke, I already said to you

271
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,417
that I don't want
to talk about this. I said it.

272
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Well, unless you're working, darling,
you do not have a choice.

273
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,167
Just...

274
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:11,917
take the meeting.

275
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,792
Jumoke, you know me.

276
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:17,500
I can't be someone that I'm not and
I can't even take a job from my company.

277
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,667
She doesn't deserve you.

278
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,375
The whole damn company
doesn't deserve you.

279
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,292
Now that I agree with.

280
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,417
Hmm... you don't want to know
what happened to me in Lekan's library.

281
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,917
-[Liah]<i> I'm worried about this pitch.</i>
-[Hauwa]<i> You're always worried.</i>

282
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,208
That's because this ad
is supposed to appeal to women

283
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,917
and it honestly doesn't feel like it.

284
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,500
That's because you don't know
what you're talking about.

285
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,458
I'm a woman, it's appealing to me.

286
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,375
It's also appealing to women,

287
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,708
by appealing to the men
that the women are attracted to.

288
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,375
-It's a win-win.
-Hauwa, I'm simply--

289
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,542
Shut up.

290
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,417
Listen, I've been selling beer commercials

291
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,458
when you were in secondary school,
drawing hearts around boys' pictures.

292
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,250
[screams]

293
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,958
Of course, Hauwa.

294
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,042
Whatever you say, Hauwa.

295
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
[man 1] Ooh!

296
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,500
See these girls, man!

297
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,792
-[man 2] I got your back.
-[man 1] You sure?

298
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,875
[man 2] Yeah.

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,208
[man 1] I got this, bro.

300
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,625
Hello...

301
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
-[laughs]
-You're blocking my light.

302
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,917
Can I meet you girls?

303
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,583
<i>Monsieur, </i>fuck off.

304
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,917
What? Are you mad?

305
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,208
Who do you think you're talking to?

306
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,750
-[man 3] Hey!
-Get your hands off me!

307
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,667
[man 3] What do you think you're doing?

308
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
What the fuck?

309
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,208
[woman] You have associated my brand
with women being harassed?

310
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,125
Oh, well,
the women are saved and then--

311
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,958
How would reminding these women

312
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,625
of some of the worst
encounters of their life

313
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,125
make them drink my product?

314
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,292
-Err--
-[Tunde] I'll take it from there.

315
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,833
[chuckles]
Thank you, Eniola, for your remark.

316
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,542
I think we'll go back and retune
and then we can meet again.

317
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,792
I don't think so, Tunde.
This is so out of parameters.

318
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,958
It's clear that we
have a different vision.

319
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,208
Eh, we-- we have an al--
an alternate idea.

320
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,083
[Liah]<i> What do I have to lose, right?</i>

321
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,083
[female narrator]
<i>The modern woman is resourceful.</i>

322
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,667
<i>She does anything to get the job done.</i>

323
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,333
<i>No matter the cost.</i>

324
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,000
<i>She is a go-getter.</i>

325
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,375
<i>An overachiever.</i>

326
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,417
[cheering]

327
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,958
<i>But even overachievers need a break.</i>

00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:55,167
{\an8}<i>Buzz... the beer</i>
<i>for the overachiever in you.</i>

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,542
It needs work.
But I'm happy to go in that direction.

330
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,833
[Liah]<i> I am so screwed.</i>

331
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:07,833
You must be crazy.

332
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,625
I don't understand.

333
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,500
If you ever pull such stunt again,
you'll be fired.

334
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,750
Don't come into my car.

335
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,583
Find your way to the office.

336
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,042
[woman sighs]
Thank you for coming.

337
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:40,792
Not a problem.

338
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,042
I... like to get my good news in person.

339
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,583
So, it's not good news?

340
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,708
-Our background checks have come back.
-My grandfather?

341
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,542
[Liah] When did your grandfather
steal this money?

342
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,333
In what? 1982?

343
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:02,083
That's what, like, forty years ago!

344
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,875
Yup.

345
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,917
He was a minister.

346
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,417
And what did he steal,
like, five million dollars?

347
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,875
-Fifty million pounds.
-Oof!

348
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,750
Still! All of a sudden
they're-- they're blacklisting you.

349
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,542
That is bullshit!

350
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:20,583
Here, here.

351
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,208
-You know what?
-What?

352
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:31,083
-To not dealing with bullshit.
-Yes!

353
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,042
-[phone ringing]
-[sighs] Hold.

It's Hauwa.

355
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,250
Ugh.

356
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,417
What does she want?

357
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,875
Yes, Hauwa.

358
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,083
[whispers] Tell her to fuck off.

359
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,667
No, Hauwa, I'm at lunch.

360
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,875
Alright, Hauwa.

[sighs, clicks tongue]

362
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,792
Got to go. Pfft!

363
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:01,958
I hate your boss.

364
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:04,542
[chuckles]
I know.

365
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,292
Fine.

366
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,167
Don't forget, fashion show tonight.

367
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,625
You're still up for that?

368
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,208
They have very good wine.

369
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,042
Hmm.

-Bye.

[Hauwa]<i> Tunde's PA is going for maternity.</i>

That's great, congratulations to her.

00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,542
Yes, indeed.

374
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,833
Tunde needed an EA for three months,
so I offered you.

375
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,500
But I am a creative executive.

And before then,
you were my executive assistant.

379
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,667
It's just for three months.
Hmm?

380
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,208
Besides, we all have to make sacrifices
for the good of the company.

381
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,042
I'm doing that by letting go
of a skilled hand for three months.

[Liah]<i> Yeah, whatever.</i>

383

the senior creative
executive role you want,

385
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,750

Girl, tell me about it.

395
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,583
The only good thing that can come out
of this is you quitting.

Please, why would I do that?

399
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,375
Uh, 'cause they just demoted you.

400
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,792
It's just for three months,
it's really not that deep.

401

-Liah.
-How can I be quitting?

402
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,875
That would be horrible
if it was for three seconds.

403
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:08,417
She's punishing you
for no reason!

404

It's vindictive and you shouldn't
put up with it.

I can't quit.

406
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,833

00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:40,542
I'm not glaring at you.

533
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,917
I am not glaring at you!

534
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,167
Young lady, listen,

535
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,417
-you need to learn...
-Mmm.

536
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:53,958
...how to be an employee.

537
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,375
Employees don't glare.

538
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,875
You are right.
This isn't going to work.

539
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,583
What are you scared of?

540
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:07,125
Success?

541
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,625
Because people like you are.

542
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,333
Um, what do you mean
by people like me?

543
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,500
Poor people.

544
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,583
This guy.

545
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,583
I am not poor.

546
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,042
Uhh...

547
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,250
Aren't you the scholarship girl
from Jumoke's secondary school

548
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,083
-or am I mistaken?
-That was me.

549
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,417
Exactly.

550
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,917
Poor people are so scared of success,
that they self-sabotage

551
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,917
I've seen this thing happen
time and time again.

552
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:33,875
I'm sorry. Not everyone
can be a lazy playboy.

553
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,875
But everybody wishes they would.

554
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,042
Liah.

555
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:45,750
Liah!

556
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,583
-Liah!
-Lekan, what do you want?

557
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,750
[Lekan] I said I'll help you.

558
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:49,750
[Liah] You call this help?

559
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,208
Listen, I know you don't like me.
You think what you're doing is wrong,

560
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,375
you need an excuse to get out of it.
But don't let my being--

561
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,208
-Being a dick?
-Oh, I was going to say attitude,

562
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,667
but, yeah, being a dick stop you.

563
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,375
You know what?

564
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,875
-Maybe this is a sign.
-That?

565
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,583
Because if you're the only person
I can get to play my boss,

566
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,833
then I don't deserve to do this at all.

567
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,792
You know
I'm a very successful actor, right?

568
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:11,792
[chuckles]

569
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,417
I've been in tons of plays.

570
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,458
Lekan, plays that you fund.

571
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,917
Plays that nobody sees.

572
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:22,167
Turns out I'm not
the only one being a dick.

573
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,875
You see why we'll work well together?

574
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,542
Young lady,

575
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,583
let me help you.

576
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,167
-Lekan, why do you care?
-Oh, no, I don't.

577
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,417
Jumoke does and she's been
my best friend since we were six--

578
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,417
Err, please,
how is she your best friend?

579
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,375
Because technically, when she was six,
you were ten.

580
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:38,750
Eight.

581
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,417
Eight and half.

582
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:42,792
Whatever. Just...

583
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,500
blame our mothers for plotting
our marriage since birth.

584
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,792
Thank God Jumoke had more sense.

585
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,292
Most likely.

586
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,417
So, are you going
to let me help you

587
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,000
or you're going to go back to doing
whatever it is you know how to do?

588
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:00,083
Come, let me help you.

589
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,125
Hey!

590
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,500
So...

591
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:20,792
How did it go?

592
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,833
Girlfriend... [sighs]

593
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,417
-I hope he wasn't too much of an asshole.
-[chuckles]

594
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,667
He called me the poor scholarship
girl from your school.

595
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,042
He-- Li, did you slap him?

596
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,583
[chuckles]
No.

597
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Wait.

598
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:37,083
-You're-- You're smiling.
-Yeah.

599
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,458
Oh, okay, so you didn't slap him.

600
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,625
Nope. I didn't.

601
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,125
Because he apologized and the rest of
the day went on pretty much smoothly.

602
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,375
-So...
-Okay.

603
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,458
Yes.

604
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,458
So you guys are ready for tomorrow?

605
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:50,917
As ready as we'll ever be.

606
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,042
I'm actually quite happy.

607
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,458
[chuckles]
I'm so relieved.

608
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:55,958
-Uh, Jumoke?
-Hmm?

609
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,667
What's this?

610
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,000
I know you don't need the money.

611
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,958
But just let me pay the way that I can.

612
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,375
[groans]
Is this because of what he said?

613
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:17,792
Look... look...

614
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,583
You know that this apartment block
is owned by my family, right?

615
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,083
-Yeah.
-And they cover all the expenses.

616
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,208
Like, I don't pay one Kobo
on this apartment.

617
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,375
Like, besides, you've already paid
for half the wine.

618
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,167
-Jumoke...
-Stop, no!

619
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,250
Take it.

620
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:34,542
And make sure you cash it.

621
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,958
[laughs]
Cashers!

622
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,250
[chuckles]

623
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,417
I can swear
you're not going to cash it.

624
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Of course
I'm not going to cash the check!

625
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,958
[laughs]

626
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:44,625
You actually have no respect for me.

627
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,917
-[chuckles]
-[Indistinct mumbling]

628
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,583
[scoffs] Why are you in jeans
and where is your suit?

629
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:07,625
Where's your suit?

630
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,667
-I don't own one.
-[exhales]

631
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,458
Why don't you own a suit?

632
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,750
Because I don't need one.

633
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:14,833
[sighs]

634
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,042
And they're even ripped!

635
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,458
Please, we have time. Let's go.

636
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,000
We'll get another one on the way.
Let's go.

637
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:21,917
Ah!

638
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,500
[laughs]

639
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:29,333
[no audible dialogue]

640
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,667
-That was a great presentation.
-Thank you, sir. I'm glad you liked it.

641
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,500
I look forward to working
with you sometime.

642
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,583
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

643
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,250
-[phone ringing]
-Oh, it's Lekan.

644
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,458
[chuckles]
Why is he calling you?

645
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,250
I'm sure he's cancelling.

646
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,792
Let me guess,

647
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,208
he's cancelling
'cause he's meeting some girl.

648
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,583
[sighs]

649
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,458
No.

650
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,417
It's not about a girl.

651
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,667
Are you okay?

652
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,583
[Lekan] Like, my phone
has been buzzing non-stop.

653
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,417
It's not been, what, a month?

654
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,625
And I've gotten invitation
to what, five pitches.

655
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:27,292
[Liah]<i> Liah, what have you done now?</i>

656
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:30,542
<i>There is no way Hauwa won't find out now.</i>

657
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,792
I-- I think she's just
overwhelmed with the news.

658
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Liah?

659
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,167
Sweetie, are you okay?

660
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,583
I'm supposed to be upset.

661
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,750
Stop it.

662
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,292
What's wrong with this one?

663
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,583
You want to talk about it?

664
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,750
Liah...

665
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:10,375
talk to me.

666
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,875
Well... [sighs]

667
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,417
There's really nothing to talk about.

668
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,542
-Nothing to say.
-[phone ringing]

669
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:28,417
How is she five centimeters
dilated already?

670
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,583
I'll be right there.

671
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:37,042
I have to go,
but we'll pick this up later, okay?

672
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,458
Alright.

673
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,542
[knocking]

674
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,500
What do you want?

675
00:37:58,417 --> 00:37:59,417
Follow me to a show.

676
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,667
You're kidding, right?

677
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,125
[sighs] Listen,

678
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,667
you can sit down here and stew over
whatever it is that is driving you crazy.

679
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,417
Or you come with me.

680
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,667
And listen to the best music
you have ever heard in your entire life.

681
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:20,542
[sighs]

682
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,583
As long as you don't ask me about it.

683
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,417
What's my business?

00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:40,292

Very good.

701
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,833
And pretty.

702
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,167
Stunning, actually.

703
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,583
And you're trying to get with her?

704
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,708
[laughs]

705
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:34,292
No...

706
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,375
Hmm...

707
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,708
Not this time.

708
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:40,167
Let's just say I'm not her type.
Let's leave it like that.

709
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,833
Ah... right.

710
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,500
[chuckles]
Okay.

711
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,125
I could introduce you, if you want.

712
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,417
Why would I want?

713
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,542
[chuckles]
I just assumed that... you know.

714
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,500
You know...

715
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:05,917
What? Why would you assume that?

716
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,167
You never gave me the look.

717
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,292
You know, like...

718
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:15,500
You know, the look.

719
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,750
[laughing]

720
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,583
Sorry. So...

721
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:24,583
I am not attracted to men
because I am not attracted to you?

722
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,917
[laughs]
Please.

723
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
-[Lekan] Don't blame me now.
-[laughs]

724
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:33,333
-All my life, every straight woman...
-Hmm...

725
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,125
...gives Lekan the look.

726
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:40,000
[laughing]
You know, you're an idiot.

727
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,292
-I know.

<i>♪ Tell me what you do when you alone? ♪</i>

730
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,292
A lot of people would actually
be ecstatic that they're getting calls.

731
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,625
But you, you truly went catatonic.

732
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,500
-What's up with that?
-Catatonic? That's a bit much.

733
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:12,375
What else do you call not
saying a word and running to your room?

734
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,500
Oh? That.

735
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,167
You said you wouldn't ask.

736
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,625
I lied.

737
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,792
Okay.

738
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:21,167
How come I have never met<i> this </i>Liah?

739
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,833
I've only met disapproving, scowling,

741
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,167
I have never met insecure,

742
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,375
It is what it is.

"Our deepest fear...

744
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,042

00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,542

[laughing]

750
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,667
Really? An inspirational quote?

00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:06,833

Who's that? Um, Marian Williamson?

What are you doing?

758
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,292
Yeah, sorry--

759
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,417
Sorry for calling this late.

Are you crazy?

[Liah]<i> Is he kidding right now?</i>

763
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,875
Yes!
Thank you for inviting us for a pitch.

764
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,417
I'll be there.

765
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,750
See you then.

766
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:50,667
Lekan is the most annoying
despicable asshole

767
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,250
-I have ever met!
-What happened?

768
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,542
Oh, my--
He didn't try to kiss you, did he?

769
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,625
No.

770
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,042
No, he didn't.

771
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,292
So what did he do?

772
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,083
He took a pitch without my consent.
Can you imagine?

773
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,125
So what?

774
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,583
You don't want it, just ignore it.
What's the big deal?

775
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:13,042
[sighs]

776
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,750
You do want it.

777
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,708
But you don't think you should want it.

778
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:20,042
-Please don't start this.
-I'm not starting anything.

779
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,125
Look, I...

780
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,708
I just had a difficult delivery.

781
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,958
I'm trying to relax.

782
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,042
[sitar music playing]

783
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,583

785
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,125
What are you doing here?

786
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,208
[in Yoruba]
Have you eaten?

787
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,167
[in English] I brought apology breakfast.

788
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:21,167
Okay.

789
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,792
First of all,

790
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:25,083
I had no right to do what I did yesterday.

791
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,375
I apologize.

792
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,458
But you need to do this!

793
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,417
Those Cars45 guys were literally
eating out of your hands!

794
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,917
Your hands.

795
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,375
Err... my voice. Your pitch. Your ideas.

796
00:44:36,792 --> 00:44:39,250
[sighs]
Lekan, please, why do you care?

797
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:40,708
Like...

798
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,375
we don't talk.

799
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,708
And you know that I don't like you.

800
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:49,042
And then, yet here you are being all
"Liah, you must do it." Why?

801
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,833
[sighs]

802
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:32,000
When I was 24 years old,

803
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,083
I invented a software that

804
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:41,042
automated a decent proportion
of illicit content monitoring.

805
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:42,667
What's that?

806
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,083
Porn. Mostly.

807
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:48,375
Oh...

808
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,000
And other stuff.

809
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,083
Okay.

810
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,458
Before my program,

811
00:45:55,917 --> 00:46:00,208
you needed about a hundred people
to monitor one million users.

812
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:03,542
But I cut it down to ten and sold
the company for fifty million dollars.

813
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:04,667
Wow.

814
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,417
Apparently, the company that
bought mine got bought

815
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,667
for half a billion dollars a year later.

816
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,542
Wow.

817
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,250
[scoffs]
No wonder you're such an asshole.

818
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,250
Oh...

819
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:24,708
It gets better.

820
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:27,833
Both companies
were backed by my investors.

821
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:31,750
They owned only 20% of mine
and 80% of the other.

822
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,167
Maximizing their earnings

823
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,292
at my expense.

824
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:41,208
So you see, even though you're very,
very annoying and very judgmental,

825
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:44,500
my case reminds me of yours.

826
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:48,083
Your company uses your ideas,
and undervalues you. So...

827
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,417
I'm here to help in every way that I can.

828
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:59,208
Um, so how do you envisage this working?

829
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,125
[chuckles]
I have no idea.

830
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,250
I'm just the talent.

831
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:08,125
Okay, but you're definitely
getting better suits.

832
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,875
[chuckles]
Okay.

833
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:15,500
[Hauwa]<i> You're late.</i>

834
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:21,250
Tunde doesn't get here until 9:00
and it's just 8:30, is there a problem?

835
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:24,500
I came to look for you,
and you weren't here.

836
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,625
Is there something
you need me to tell Tunde?

837
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:31,667
You've had a long enough holiday.

838
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,250
-I don't understand.
-What don't you understand?

839
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
-[phone ringing]
-I said I'm taking you back.

840
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,500
Unless you want to be stuck
on Tunde's desk.

841
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,833
Of course not.

842
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:45,708
Good.

843
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:48,000
Go grab your stuff and let's go.

844
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:10,500
Right Pizza has requested for a pitch
from Aniya creative agency.

845
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:14,292
Aniya? Um, who is that
and how do you know?

846
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,667
A wannabe agency.

847
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:20,125
And why do you care about
a wannabe creative agency?

848
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:24,333
Because wannabe agencies grow up
to become big agencies.

849
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,333
So it's always best to nip
that shit in the bud.

850
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:29,875
I see.

851
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:35,375
So cancel any plans you must have had
because you're working late tonight.

852
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,000
Damn it.

853
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:38,583
I know.

854
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,333
-You were home free.
-I know.

855
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:43,708
[sighs]

856
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:44,792
But...

857
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,458
I guess it's confirmation
of your talent...

858
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:49,958
that she wants you.

859
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:50,875
[sighs]

860
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,458
Right now, it doesn't feel like that.

861
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:59,167
And since it's you, you're pulling Aniya
out of the running.

862
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,625
Jumoke, I really don't have a choice.

863
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,583
I hope you're not closing, Aniya?

864
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:05,000
-No. Ugh.
-Good.

865
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,000
I just need to find a company
that Apex isn't interested in.

866
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:15,208
Okay, that makes sense.

867
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,292
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

868
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,375
It's fine.

878
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,833
Wait, wait, wait.

879
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:50,500
Is there anyone who isn't Apex's client?

880
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:52,500
We've been running
this for over an hour now.

Is everything okay?

885
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,542
Um, SupaPhone.

886
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,417
Really?

887
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,583
Yeah.

888
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:16,208
Apex isn't pitching
to a fit phone company?

889
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,917
Well, we're a bit conflicted because
we're working for their competitors. So...

890
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:21,833
-Okay.
-Yeah.

891
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:23,417
SupaPhone it is.

892
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,125
SupaPhone it is.

893
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:28,417
Right.

894
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:30,292
[camera clicks]

895
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,583
And so I'll say,

896
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,292
SupaPhone,

897
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,250
the difference is clear.

898
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,083
[laughs]

899
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,083
[Lekan] What's funny?

900
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:12,333
Because that's a famous 7UP slogan.
Like, everybody knows that.

901
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:15,458
Okay, so we need another slogan then.

902
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:16,792
Yes.

903
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,125
We do.

904
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,917
But you're very good at this.

905
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:21,167
Well...

906
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:25,417
I must have done a million pitches
while I was trying to raise money.

907
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,417
Okay.

908
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,750
And one time, I actually pitched
with full-on malaria.

909
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,625
-Hmm.
-Believe it or not.

910
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,250
So what happened that day was that...

911
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:38,208
What?

912
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,917
Go on, say it. I promise you
I won't get offended.

913
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,667
So how did you know that
what I'm going to say is offensive?

914
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:49,917
[chuckles]

915
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:52,750
Fine.

916
00:51:53,792 --> 00:51:55,458
Okay, so I wanted to know...

917
00:51:56,292 --> 00:52:01,583
How did you go from building
a multimillion dollar company in your 20s

918
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,542
to...

919
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:05,583
ugh, I don't know...

920
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,833
whatever this is?

921
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,417
Retiring early is living the dream.

922
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,667
Hmm.

923
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,000
I couldn't.

924
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,250
You couldn't what?

925
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,333
I couldn't try anything else.

926
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:31,917
-Hmm.
-[chuckles] I mean, I tried.

927
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,000
Others tried.

928
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:37,625
I even came back to Nigeria
for a clean slate. But I just...

929
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,208
...couldn't.

930
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,083
So then, why the theatre?

931
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,500
Well, my therapist actually...

932
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,500
suggested improv. But then...

933
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:55,958
I fell in love with acting.

934
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,375
And bought a theatre.

935
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,667
-Perks of being rich, baby.
-[scoffs] Please.

936
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,417
Who's your baby? Ugh. Anyways...

937
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,167
Thank you.

938
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,625
Back to work?

939
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:22,167
Yeah, back to work.

940
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:28,125
[Hauwa] Hello, Liah.
Where are you going to?

941
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,750
Good afternoon, Hauwa,
I was just heading for lunch.

942
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,750
Lunch? You have a pitch
which is due for tomorrow.

943
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,792
It's irresponsible to run off.

944
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,042
I already sent it to your email.

945
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,792
I know, I have to review it.

946
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,875
And I'm sure you want
to be around for that.

947
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,542
Yes.

948
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:44,417
[Hauwa] Come on!

949
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,208
[mumbling]

950
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:55,250
Okay, you know what, Liah,
you just have to go at her.

951
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,250
[sighs]
That's it. I'm telling her.

952
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:00,958
[Hauwa]
This meeting must hold.

953
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:03,500
I-- I'm sorry I have to leave.
My-- My aunty is sick.

954
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,500
-[sighs]
-I almost lost my mind.

955
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,583
It's fine.

956
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,958
-No problem.
-[sighs] Okay, fine.

957
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:18,000
So, yeah. What do you think?

958
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,583
-Uhh...
-Oh, shit!

959
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,083
-What is it?
-Don't move. Don't move.

960
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,333
-What do you mean "don't move"?
-Just don't move!

961
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,750
[mumbles]

962
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,958
[footsteps approaching]

963
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,667
[Tunde] Liah?

964
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:40,667
Err... [sighs] Hello, Tunde.

965
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,792
This is my friend, um...

966
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,667
This is my friend.

967
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,500
[Tunde] Hmm...

968
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,375
How are you, friend?

969
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:50,875
Nice to meet you.

970
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:53,458
Carry on.

971
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:57,667
[sighs]

972
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,583
Who was that?

973
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,583
That's my boss' boss.
That is Tunde.

974
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,292
Hauwa's boss.

975
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:04,708
Hmm...

976
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,917
We're ready for you now.

977
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:10,958
[sighs]

978
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:14,458
-Can you see that?
-[Liah] See what?

979
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:16,375
She's secretly judging you
for putting your tongue in my mouth.

980
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:17,875
Err, there was no tongue, please.

981
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,333
-I felt some tongue.
-Ugh, please.

982
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,250
-You want to try again?
-[Liah] Definitely not.

983
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,500
[Lekan] He said we should carry on.

984
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:23,750
[Liah] Please.

985
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,750
[laughing]

986
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,250
-I can't believe this.
-Stop laughing, it's not funny.

987
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,958
-It really is!
-How is it funny?

988
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:33,333
-You, Liah! You kissed Lekan! On purpose!
-I didn't--

989
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,042
I didn't kiss him on purpose!

990
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,042
[laughs]
You're annoying!

991
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:40,000
Stop!
I'm going to stop doing your hair.

992
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,083
Yes, please stop doing my hair.

993
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:47,042
[laughing]

994
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,958
-Did you actually call me Lekan's--
-I swear!

995
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:50,042
Wow!

996
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,583
Put your head down.

997
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:54,167
-You're bullying me!
-Sorry.

998
00:55:58,417 --> 00:55:59,667
[Hauwa] This is crap.

999
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:03,875
This is the most useless pitch
I've ever seen.

1000
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:08,375
If I wanted this crap,
I'd have kept you on Tunde's desk.

1001
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:09,750
Do better!

1002
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:12,417
{\an8}I sincerely thought
this was what you wanted.

1003
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,708
Oh, really?

1004
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,833
I wanted crap?

1005
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,542
Fix it! Nonsense.

1006
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,333
Talking shit.

1007
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,042
[Jumoke] Of course you're going to use it.

1008
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:34,208
You think this is the way to go?

1009
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:35,125
Right?

1010
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,500
Yeah, so...

1011
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:41,500
So... you can use the idea, guilt-free.

1012
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,167
And Hauwa might be right.
The pitch might be shit.

1013
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:48,250
I mean, what do you have to lose?

1014
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,292
Just think about it.

1015
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:53,000
Okay, fine.

1016
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:59,708
[party music playing
over speakers]

1017
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,250
So forceful.

1018
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,083
-Uh, hi.
-Hey, Liah.

1019
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:06,292
Hey.

1020
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:08,250
Um, can we talk?

1021
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,083
Somewhere else.

1022
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,208
Really, Lekan?

1023
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,792
Your make-out spot?

1024
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,167
Don't worry, my hands
will be kept to myself,

1025
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,750
except, of course, you want them to move.

1026
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,000
Can I just stab myself in the eye instead?

1027
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:31,125
[laughs] If you want to.

1028
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:32,500
[clicks tongue]
So...

1029
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:34,750
Wassup?

1030
00:57:35,292 --> 00:57:37,292
I came here to discuss the pitch.

1031
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,583
[laughing]

1032
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:45,917
What's funny?

1033
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:48,292
Ah...

1034
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,833
-You came to discuss the pitch?
-Yeah.

1035
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:56,708
[laughing]

1036
00:57:57,375 --> 00:58:00,458
Just say... you came to see me.

1037
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:04,000
No... yes... it's just...

1038
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:08,583
it's just that you have,
you have to do the pitch alone.

1039
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:14,500
[Lekan] Wait!

1040
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:19,875
It's okay.
I shouldn't have asked.

1041
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,417
-I know what it will take for you to--
-I'll do it.

1042
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,708
What?

1043
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:28,500
[sighs] I said I'll do it.

1044
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:31,333
I mean, you have to...

1045
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,167
you have to die of something, right?

1046
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:40,250
Lekan, thank you.

1047
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,333
Do you know him?

1048
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:24,042
Uh... No, he's-- he's so pretty.

1049
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,583
Hmm, girls.

1050
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,625
Always led by their hormones.

1051
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:30,042
That's the CEO of Aniya.

1052
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,208
Oh...

1053
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:34,708
Go say hello.

1054
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,042
Um, what? Why-- Why would I do that?

1055
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:41,708
[sighs]

1056
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:43,667
[Lekan] What are you doing?

1057
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,625
Ugh. Well, Hauwa sent me to come over.

1058
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:46,792
What? Why?

1059
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:47,875
No idea. How did it go?

1060
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:48,958
Don't mind.
[chuckles]

1061
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,417
It was crazy but,

1062
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,125
-I really need you in there.
-Liah.

1063
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:55,417
Won't you introduce me to your new friend?

1064
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,917
So that's why she told me to come over.

1065
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,833
[Lekan] Right!

1066
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,042
Let's go.

1067
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,875
Lekan Davis.

1068
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,083
Tech millionaire,
trying his hands at advertising.

1069
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,208
Interesting.

1070
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:14,625
Well, you know techies, we try everything.

1071
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,833
[Hauwa] Cool, of course.

1072
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:20,750
Always cool to have new blood
in our industry.

1073
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,000
-Thank you, ma'am.
-I'll take my leave, Liah?

1074
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:25,583
Excuse me.

1075
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:26,958
[sighs]

1076
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:43,042
-[Ndidi] Hi!
-Hi, Ndidi, how are you?

1077
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:45,375
[Ndidi] I'm very well, Hauwa,
you look good!

1078
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,083
Thank you and you too.

1079
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,667
-So how's Chidi?
-Great!

1080
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,875
Okay, good.

1081
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,958
I hope you guys are on point.

1082
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:57,458
Because the last guys were good.

1083
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:59,167
Really? Who are they?

1084
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,708
Aniya.

1085
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,625
Um, new guys, but really hungry.

1086
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:05,833
Okay.

1087
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,000
So...

1088
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,708
[laughs]
So, shall we begin?

1089
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,125
-Let's get started.
-Okay.

1090
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,000
[party music playing]

1091
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:45,667
{\an8}[narrator]<i> Right Pizza...</i>
<i>the right way to live.</i>

1092
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:50,292
So that's the future we have for you.

1093
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:54,083
Fun, fresh, millennials for life.

1094
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:56,708
-Wow. I love it.
-Thank you.

1095
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:58,208
I absolutely love it.

1096
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:01,792
It, it fits the brand
and it hit the right notes.

1097
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:04,708
Good. So can we get started on legals?

1098
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,833
Err...

1099
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:11,250
-[chuckles]
-Um, is it too soon?

1100
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:13,583
You want us to discuss? Not a problem.

1101
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:14,875
Shoot.

1102
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:18,292
[chuckles]
So, Hauwa, it's not that.

1103
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:23,625
I mean, before the last guys,
I would have just said yes.

1104
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:29,750
But the last guys pitched a nostalgia play
that we couldn't say no to.

1105
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,042
I see.

1106
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:38,042
Um, don't you think you should do both?

1107
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,833
Like, um, cater to your target audience

1108
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:44,417
and also do this
nostalgia thing you mentioned.

1109
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:48,333
I wish I had the budget.
I truly do.

1110
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:52,500
Hauwa, you know how these things go.

1111
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:55,708
Please, it's not really my place.

1112
01:02:57,708 --> 01:03:00,667
Okay. I truly understand.

1113
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,792
[sighs]

1114
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:09,042
-We'll take our leave.
-Okay. [chuckles]

1115
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,208
We lost to Aniya again?

1116
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,542
Sir, we came second.

1117
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:15,458
That's nonsense. Second?

1118
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,250
Second? That's not who we are!
That's shitty! It's nonsense!

1119
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:21,583
-It won't happen again.
-It better not!

1120
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,375
-I'm sorry--
-Eh, no!

1121
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,708
Would it be rude if I asked you
to leave my office?

1122
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,708
-You see I--
-Leave my office now!

1123
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,000
I'm going to destroy that boy.

1124
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:01,708
[Liah]<i> I can't believe it.</i>
<i>I'm actually winning!</i>

1125
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:04,375
To Aniya! Long may reign!

1126
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:05,375
Yaay!

1127
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:06,333
[laughs]

1128
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:07,792
-Eyes?
-Oh, yeah.

1129
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:10,625
-Eyes.
-Seven years, guys, seven years.

1130
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,125
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1131
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:16,667
Did that woman actually say she
wanted to what? Destroy me?

1132
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,875
[in Yoruba]
Me?

1133
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,167
Olamilekan Davis.

1134
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:21,583
-Boy, you scared?
-No, baby, I'm turned on.

1135
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:23,292
[scoffs]
Of course.

1136
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:24,542
It's work now.

1137
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:26,125
[chuckles]

1138
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:30,917
So when are you leaving Apex?

1139
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,958
What do you mean?

1140
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,500
Once, a fluke.

1141
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,292
Twice, strength.

1142
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,208
Three times? Baby, three times is destiny!

1143
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:43,958
It's time to focus on Aniya!

1144
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,542
But you know I'm not going
to do this forever now.

1145
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,917
That is so true.

1146
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:54,792
I know.

1147
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:58,125
Why don't you hire Liah

1148
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:00,208
-as creative director?
-Hmm...

1149
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:02,083
And then quit and then
she takes over as CEO.

1150
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:03,167
Mm-hmm.

1151
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,958
-[in Pidgin] Sense will not kill you.
-Right?

1152
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,458
-Thanks. Smart.
-[Liah] Yeah.

1153
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,375
Could you guys be any more obvious?

1154
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,500
-What?
-You too, what?

1155
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,792
What? You think we planned this?

1156
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,625
Of course I know you planned it.

1157
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:16,292
Mmm.

1158
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:20,500
I told you this girl
would figure this thing out.

1159
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,875
Whatever.

1160
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,625
See, this is it.

1161
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,625
You've proven yourself.

1162
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:31,417
It's time to leave the nest, baby eagle.

1163
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:37,458
Please, can I at least think about it?

1164
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:38,875
-[Lekan] Of course.
-No.

1165
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,583
Just remember...

1166
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,500
I bore easy.

1167
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:45,125
Of course. It's you.

1168
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,292
Ah, there you are.

1169
01:05:58,667 --> 01:05:59,875
We have a problem.

1170
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,875
Is that right?

1171
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,583
Uh...
[clears throat]

1172
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,333
I'm sorry about my outburst
earlier in the day.

1173
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:08,625
I-- I was totally out of line. I'm sorry.

1174
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:13,000
The thing about apologies is that you're
not expected to repeat the crime again.

1175
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:16,625
Look, my friend Chidi,
who works with Drip mobile

1176
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:19,125
sent me a message earlier in the day.

1177
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:20,875
They want Aniya.

1178
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:25,292
Impossible! Tunde, we've had
that contract for four years!

1179
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,500
No!

1180
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,667
I can't lose that contract!

1181
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,917
Especially not to that asshole!

1182
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,625
I was hoping you'll say just that.

1183
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,333
Now, let's get back to work.

1184
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:37,542
<i>Right.</i>

1185
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:41,583

-[in Pidgin] Don't fall.
-It's...

1187
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,375
-[in Pidgin] Don't fall.
-I'm fine, Lekan.

1188
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:48,333
-Please!
-[phone ringing]

1189
01:06:48,417 --> 01:06:49,708
[chuckles]

1190
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:51,000
It's Hauwa.

1191
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:53,375
At 10 pm? Don't pick up.

1192
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,750
-[scoffs] I have to.
-Why?

1193
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,083
[sighs]
She wants me to come in.

1194
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:04,625
It's 10. You're quitting, tell her no.

1195
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,333
I can't, I'll just get a cab.

1196
01:07:07,417 --> 01:07:08,583
[both] I'll take you.

1197
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:12,083
You want to drive on
third mainland at 10 pm?

1198
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,500
Fine. Take her.

1199
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:17,167
-Let's go.
-I said I'll get a cab.

1200
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:21,625
[in Pidgin]
What's wrong with her?

1201
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,917
What took you so long?

1202
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,208
You called me in at 10 pm.

1203
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:29,708
Don't you ever take that tone with me!

1204
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,000
Okay?

1205
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,083
Sorry.

1206
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:38,042
You need to put together a brief
for a Drip mobile contract

1207
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:39,458
and it has to be fire.

1208
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:41,750
They want Aniya but we just have--

1209
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,250
They want Aniya?

1210
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,458
How-- How do you know?

1211
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,042
Doesn't matter.

1212
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:52,583
We need a pitch that
would blow Aniya out the water.

1213
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:56,417
I don't care if you're going
to work all night, weekend.

1214
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:02,542
We must win this pitch. Okay?

1215
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,583
[sighs]

1216
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,375
I can't.

1217
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,500
What do you mean?

1218
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:16,542
I said I can't.

1219
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:19,375
What do you mean you can't?

1220
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:23,792
Because... because I am Aniya.

1221
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:27,875
You're what?

1222
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,792
I said, I am Aniya.

1223
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,542
Get out of my office.

1224
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:45,208
-I'm sorry, I--
-Get out of my office now!

1225
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
[laughs]
You're crazy.

1226
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,292
Hey.

1227
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,000
What are you still doing here?

1228
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:14,542
That you wandered off,
doesn't mean the party should stop.

1229
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,375
You want to talk about it?

1230
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:21,500
Liah!

1231
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,542
I quit tonight.

1232
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:25,833
Oh, shit.

1233
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:29,958
She wanted me to work
on the Drip mobile contract.

1234
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:32,375
And apparently, they want Aniya.

1235
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,833
I just couldn't see myself
working on two pitches again.

1236
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:37,375
I-- I just couldn't.

1237
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,833
Oh, okay, maybe we should calm down.

1238
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,167
I can't believe...

1239
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,833
I can't believe I did that,
I can't believe I told...

1240
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,458
I told Hauwa that I was Aniya.

1241
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,875
[Liah hyperventilating]

1242
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,667
Jumoke, what have I done?

1243
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,500
-Oh-- Woah!
-What?

1244
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,750
I've spoiled everything.

1245
01:09:57,833 --> 01:10:01,250
-I've-- I've ruined everything.
-It's going to be-- Liah!

1246
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:03,500
Liah! You're finally free!

1247
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:06,667
-[breathing heavily]
-Okay?

1248
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,708
-[sobs]
-It's okay.

1249
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,750
Just breathe.

1250
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:12,583
-[crying]
-Just breathe

1251
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:16,250
Liah, you're okay. You're okay.

1252
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:18,083
You're okay.

1253
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:22,833
[Lekan]<i> What are they doing here?</i>

1254
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,833
-What is this?
-It's a cease and desist letter.

1255
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:36,500
[Liah] What does that mean?

1256
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:39,667
If you go ahead with the pitch,
I will sue you for all you're worth.

1257
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,833
No matter how small it will be.

1258
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:43,333
-[Lekan] You can't do that!
-Oh, yes, we can!

1259
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:44,333
[Lekan] Who's this one now?

1260
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:47,333
Barrister Emeka Nwosu, Apex's lawyer.

1261
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,917
Oh, by the way,

1262
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:51,250
Miss Liah here is an employee of Apex.

1263
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:56,167
So whatever pitch she produces,
belongs to Apex.

1264
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,417
Mr. Davis, we're ready for you.

1265
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,708
-Liah, let's go.
-He's a rich boy, he has nothing to lose.

1266
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:03,208
Can you say the same?

1267
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:06,625
You poverty-ridden little nonsense.

1268
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:10,625
[sniffs]

1269
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:15,208
Liah, Liah, don't listen to them.
Don't let them get to you.

1270
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:17,083
They don't have any case,
they're bluffing.

1271
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,792
I'm sorry.

1272
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,458
I can't.

1273
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:24,792
Good decision you've taken.

1274
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,917
See you at the office tomorrow
for a settlement conference.

1275
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:43,125
Hello, I'm here to see Bode.

1276
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,375
{\an8}[Liah sighs]

1277
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:48,667
I'm sorry.

1278
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:54,167
What are you sorry about?
You didn't do anything.

1279
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,625
I pushed you to quitting.

1280
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,917
Lekan, I'm not a child!

1281
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:00,375
I make my own decisions.

1282
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,958
I'm not saying you don't.

1283
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:04,292
-All I'm trying to say is--
-Shut up.

1284
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,667
Listen, you're not going
to take this lying down.

1285
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,875
I promise you, I'll ge--

1286
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:12,917
[instrumental music playing]

1287
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,375
I... I, I said shut up.

1288
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,167
Okay...

1289
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:27,083
That's one way to do it.

1290
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,417
Ow! Ow!

1291
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:13,792
[Jumoke through walls]
I'm actually being serious.

1292
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:20,542
You will never guess what happened to--

1293
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,208
What the fuck, Liah!

1294
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,750
Jumoke...

1295
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,125
-Jumoke, I can explain. I--
-[Jumoke] What?

1296
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,708
-You tripped and fell on his dick--
-Jumoke!

1297
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:36,750
[chuckles] I actually can't believe
you were dumb enough to fall for him.

1298
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,625
Um, I'm an adult,
and I make my own decisions.

1299
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:40,708
Oh, please.

1300
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,625
What do you even mean by that?

1301
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,125
-Hm?
-I love, Lekan.

1302
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:48,292
But he is broken.

1303
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,667
And if you stay with him,
he will break you.

1304
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,792
I know exactly what he is.

1305
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:55,250
-And I definitely can handle--
-Fix him?

1306
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:58,417
How about you join the queue
with the other girls?

1307
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:01,042
Anything else, Mom?

1308
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,375
-I just want what's best for--
-No!

1309
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:04,792
Jumoke,

1310
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,083
you want what you think is best for me.

1311
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:08,583
What is that supposed to mean?

1312
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,958
Do you know I'm being sued by Apex?

1313
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:11,625
And somehow that's my fault?

1314
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:14,875
What happened to being an adult...

1315
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,250
who makes their own decisions?

1316
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,375
You know what, I don't have time for this.

1317
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,833
[whispers] Don't start judging me
for that, bitch.

1318
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:27,625
[door opens, slams]

1319
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:38,917
[Lekan] That didn't sound like fun.
Are you okay?

1320
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:42,792
Liah.

1321
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,542
Say something now.

1322
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,583
Listen, Jumoke will be fine.

1323
01:14:58,208 --> 01:14:59,667
Liah, talk to me now.

1324
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:05,250
[Liah] Look, Lekan, I know that...

1325
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:09,208
this doesn't sound right but...

1326
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,792
I need to be alone right now.

1327
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:21,750
[chuckles]

1328
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,417
That's usually my line.

1329
01:15:58,292 --> 01:15:59,542
I'm sorry.

1330
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,292
[door opens]

[door closes]

1332
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:25,917
She kissed me.

1333
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,500
Did she force you to kiss her back?

1334
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,875
Look at her now,
does anybody need forcing?

1335
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,000
[in Yoruba]
What's wrong with you?

1336
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,708
Look, we've been friends
since we were kids.

1337
01:16:40,792 --> 01:16:43,000
-And I love you like a brother.
-I know.

1338
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:44,333
Sorry.

1339
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:48,000
If you act like you always do

1340
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:49,833
and she cuts you off,

1341
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:51,458
I will too.

1342
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:55,125
[laughs]

1343
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,042
And what if she dumps me?

1344
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,917
Well, then, karma is a bitch.

1345
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:07,542
[laughing]

1346
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,458
I hate you.

1347
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,708
-I love you, too.
-I'm serious.

1348
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:16,375
[laughing]

1349
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:27,333
So you thought you could get
away with it, right?

1350
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,542
Liah, how dare you?

1351
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,917
After everything I've done for you,
you became the competition?

1352
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:36,750
You refused to promote me.
I earned that promotion.

1353
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,958
You ungrateful little shit!

1354
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:40,417
You piece of rubbish!

1355
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,292
Hey, hey, hey, ladies. Calm down.

1356
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:46,125
We are not here to fight, alright?

1357
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,167
You threatened to sue me.

1358
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,958
You used the company's property!

1359
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:51,583
Pitched an idea we worked so hard--

1360
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,042
With an idea you rejected.

1361
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:57,125
Well, Liah, you are an employee.

1362
01:17:57,583 --> 01:18:01,125
Whatever ideas
you generate are our property.

1363
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,792
Liah, nobody is going to sue you.

1364
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:10,250
We're here to chart a new path.

1365
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:13,292
A new, a new path,
what does that even mean?

1366
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:18,542
Well, you are going to sell Aniya to us.

1367
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,917
You will be made the creative director.

1368
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,500
And if I refuse?

1369
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,667
Then I get to destroy you.

1370
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:29,583
[Tunde] Think about it.

1371
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,208
Just think about it.

1372
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,125
It doesn't have to get this ugly.

1373
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:37,667
-[Jumoke] Of course you should take it.
-How can you say she should take it?

1374
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:41,167
Because they're paying her for Aniya
and making her creative director.

1375
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,125
Because she's worth a lot more!

1376
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:46,875
Listen, go at it alone, I promise you,
you won't regret it.

1377
01:18:47,167 --> 01:18:48,500
And when they sue her?

1378
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,583
We have money now, the case will be
in court for a long time.

1379
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:52,125
And who will hire her then?

1380
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,292
Exactly.

1381
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,250
She's right.

1382
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:00,458
I'm sorry.

1383
01:19:00,917 --> 01:19:02,917
You have nothing to apologize for.

1384
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,667
Jumoke, can you just give us like,
two minutes please. Please.

1385
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:13,875
[sighs]

1386
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:21,583
I know how this makes you feel.

1387
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:36,833
Don't let them rate you less.

1388
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:40,167
Lekan, this is more
than I ever dreamed of.

1389
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,625
And it's still not enough!

1390
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,417
Please, Liah,

1391
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:52,208
don't do this.

1392
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,750
Do what?

1393
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,583
Make me watch them destroy you.

1394
01:19:56,667 --> 01:20:00,500
They aren't destroying me, they're giving
me everything I ever wanted.

1395
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:02,167
You gave it to yourself!

1396
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,417
And this way I get to keep it!

1397
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:09,000
Lekan, I know you.

1398
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,250
I don't know how
to withdraw from the world.

1399
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:15,375
This is actually what I want.

1400
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:21,625
I hope this makes you happy.

1401
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:24,125
Lekan, you can make me happy.

1402
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,625
[sighs]

1403
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,208
I'm sorry.

1404
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,083
You don't deserve this.

1405
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,542
I said, you don't deserve this.

1406
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,417
You know, I was happy working with you.

1407
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,917
You're going to fail.

1408
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:55,667
-You got lucky.
-Hmm.

1409
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:57,333
But, Liah,

1410
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,167
you will fail.

1411
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:02,167
And Tunde will fire you.

1412
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:06,333
And then, you will run back
to your village where you came from.

1413
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:08,958
Trust me.

1414
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,958
You will fail.

Liah.

1450
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:18,333
What are you doing here?

1451
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:23,292
Okay, that wasn't the welcome I was...

1452
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:25,208
hoping for...

1453
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:28,667
Please, tomorrow is my first presentation,
I don't have time for this.

1454
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:30,583
I turned down sex tonight.

1455
01:25:33,042 --> 01:25:34,625
I'm sorry, what?

1456
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:39,000
I turned down sex
with a girl so beautiful,

1457
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:40,875
she would make your eyes hurt.

1458
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:43,917
But not as beautiful as you, of course.

1459
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:45,500
You too are...

1460
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:47,792
beautiful.

1461
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,375
[chuckles]
You're babbling.

1462
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:51,875
Why are you babbling?

1463
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:56,708
I don't have time for this nonsense.

1464
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:57,875
It was because of you.

1465
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:03,167
Listen, I didn't realize it until...

1466
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,833
I was looking at her
and all I could think about was you.

1467
01:26:05,917 --> 01:26:07,750
I didn't even have sex with her.
I want to have sex with you.

1468
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,250
Lucky me, Lekan.

1469
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:12,833
Li, I don't care about your job
or anything. I just want you.

1470
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:13,917
Hmm.

1471
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,917
I know you're going to be so miserable...

1472
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,292
-Yeah.
-But it's...

1473
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:23,958
As long as you need to do this,
I'll be here to make you smile.

1474
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,333
Get out, Lekan.

What?

1476
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:31,083
-Lekan, do I look stupid to you?
-What?

1477
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:33,458
Do I look like a helpless victim to you?

1478
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:34,583

What is wrong with you?

1479
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:36,833
[in English] What are you talking about?
You know what they're doing to you!

1480
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:38,417
Nobody did anything to me!

1481
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:42,125
-You're not listening to me!
-No! You aren't listening to me!

1482
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:51,458
But, Liah, I'm just trying to let
you know that I choose you.

1483
01:26:56,917 --> 01:26:57,917
Lekan.

1484
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,708
Lekan, you should have... should have
chosen me when I asked you to.

1485
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:03,917
When I needed you to!

1486
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,750
Liah, I wasn't ready.

1487
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:08,958
I can't.

1488
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:12,667
And I can't do this when you can
just walk away from me so easily!

It's to be expected.

1502
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:26,333
You see, the bank contract
is worth billions to our company.

No pressure.

I want you to understand what is at stake.

1507
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,708
I'll tell you what...

1508
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,250
If you win us this contract,

1509
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:44,292
you will not only be
Aniya's creative director,

1510
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:46,750
but that of Apex as well.

1511
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:49,542
What of Hauwa?

1512
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,250
What about Hauwa?

1513
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:53,917
Her best ideas were yours.

1514
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,417
I would want your ideas as you.

1515
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:58,542
[Liah] Hmm.

1516
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,875
-I'll try not to let you down.
-Good.

1517
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:04,292
Do you have a minute?

1518
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:09,542
I just had a conversation with Tunde.

1519
01:29:09,667 --> 01:29:10,875
Good for you.

1520
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,167
[chuckles]

1521
01:29:12,292 --> 01:29:14,042
He offered me your job.

1522
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:20,208
Is that why you sabotaged me
and tried to hold me back?

1523
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,167
You thought I'd replace you?

1524
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,583
How could you think so little of me?

1525
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:31,500
Maybe I misjudged you.

1526
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:35,250
You're not the first I mentored
who tried to take my spot.

1527
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,625
I didn't try to take your spot.

1528
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,083
I couldn't risk it.

1529
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:40,833
You were too good for that.

1530
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,042
So why did you fight for me to come back,
if you knew that this would happen?

1531
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,708
Because Tunde was going to fire me anyway.

1532
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,750
I've given 15 years of my life to Apex.

1533
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:57,167
The least I could do was to
ensure I have a worthy successor.

1534
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,833
I'm sorry, that doesn't make any sense.

1535
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:03,333
Only because you're still a child.

1536
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:06,292
You have no sense of legacy.

You've been avoiding my calls.

I think we've said all we need to say.

I sent you an email.

1543
01:30:36,833 --> 01:30:37,917
I read your email.

1544
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:41,333
$20 million can go a long way.

1545
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:44,375
You can help save the lives
of a lot of women.

1546
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,375
Not on those terms.

I'll take that as a yes.

that's awesome.

I've been so caught up in my own shit

1553
01:31:54,042 --> 01:31:56,375
that I didn't even realize
we were still talking.

1554
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,375
They made me an offer.

1555
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:05,000
Renounce my family,

1556
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:07,792
return the money and...

get $20 million
to change the world.

1558
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,583
And you said no?

1559
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:18,250
-I said no.
-Why?

1560
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:20,042
Because...

1561
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,333
I'm starting to believe Lekan was right.

1562
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,250
What do you mean?

1563
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:35,333
Doing the right thing
the wrong way will destroy you.

1564
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,375
I mean, look at you.

1565
01:32:38,625 --> 01:32:40,208
Liah, you hate yourself.

1566
01:32:40,292 --> 01:32:41,917
I don't hate myself, it's j--

1567
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:46,208
I'm hoping that it will pass.

1568
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:50,667
What a way to feel
when you get everything you want.

1569
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:53,917
You had gamed it out.

1570
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:57,167
The smart decision was staying.

1571
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,167
I know, I agree but...

1572
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:02,875
Sometimes you have to not be
smart to be happy.

01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:04,875
Huh?

That doesn't even make any sense.

01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:09,708
Clearly.

1577
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:10,667
[sighs]

1578
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,500
But it's true though.

1579
01:33:15,292 --> 01:33:17,000
I'm not sorry, by the way.

1580
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:21,250
-Pushing you to do Aniya.
-Oh...

1581
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:25,000
You proved that you were great.

1582
01:33:27,042 --> 01:33:28,292
[sighs]

1583
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,125
Thank you, Jumoke. Like...

1584
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:35,958
you've had my back and
thank you for always pushing me, like,

1585
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:39,500
you're always there for me.
You're amazing.

1586
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:40,667
[chuckles]

1587
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:44,500
[laughs]

1588
01:33:47,042 --> 01:33:48,667
We have to move.

1589
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:51,792
I thought you just said
you didn't take the deal?

1590
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:53,250
I didn't take the deal.

1591
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:56,875
Renounce my money? My family?
Am I mad?

1592
01:33:56,958 --> 01:33:58,667
Okay, then, what did you do?

1593
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:02,000
-Well, I...
-Mm-hmm?

1594
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:09,083
I agreed to live off of my salary
as paid for by the grant...

1595
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:15,250
for five years. And since this place
is rent free, we have to move.

1596
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:20,250
Okay, so... how much is this salary
that you agreed to take?

1597
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:25,583
-Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
-Huh?

1598
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:27,542
A year?

1599
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,417
-What?
-What, it's a sacrifice!

1600
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,583
Such a sacrifice.

1601
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:36,083
[sighs]

1602
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:40,958
[sighs]
It's fine.

1603
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,833
-I might need that check though.
-[laughing]

1604
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:49,792
-It's fine. Your girl is rich now, so...
-[laughing]

1605
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,958
-We'll be fine.
-[sighs]

1606
01:34:57,292 --> 01:35:00,208
[Liah]<i> When Tunde gave me this brief,</i>
<i>I wanted to know one thing.</i>

1607
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:04,583
How do I achieve the vision
that you have for the bank?

1608
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:06,833
How do I show
that this is not just a bank,

1609
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:09,125
but a partner in achieving dreams?

1610
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:12,500
<i>It's a mother paying</i>
<i>for her child's school fees.</i>

1611
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,083
<i>Or paying for that last minute training</i>
<i>to help her son win a race.</i>

1612
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,458
<i>It's a lawyer starting a firm.</i>

1613
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:30,458
<i>It's a banker working tirelessly to ensure</i>
<i>that his customers succeed.</i>

1614
01:35:32,167 --> 01:35:36,250
<i>Or all the women who come together</i>
<i>to make something great.</i>

1615
01:35:38,417 --> 01:35:40,917
<i>And a bank that sees that greatness.</i>

1616

1620
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,792
[Hauwa] Hmm...

1621
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:25,458
[crying continues]

1622
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:34,917
You got what you asked for.

1623
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:37,083
And you're here, crying like a baby.

1624
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:41,792
One more advice,

1625
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:48,625
if you want to succeed in my role,
do not let them see you cry. Okay?

1626
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:50,958
In your role?

1627
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:53,917
Does that mean it's official?

1628
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,500
He told me today.

1629
01:36:57,542 --> 01:37:00,000
Tunde has a great sense of timing.

1630
01:37:03,292 --> 01:37:07,625
You know, I'd rather have worked with you,
than replaced you.

1631
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,708
Is that right?

1632
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,083
[sobbing]

1633
01:37:17,917 --> 01:37:19,500
Wow-wow-wow-wow...

1634
01:37:21,917 --> 01:37:23,542
[chuckles]
Oh, wow...

1635
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,625
It was a lovely evening, wasn't it?

1636
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,292
It's about to get better.

1637
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:31,375
Oh, well, uh,
let's not create a scene here.

1638
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:32,875
Oh, not at all.

1639
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,583
I just wanted to tell you
I'm starting a new agency.

1640
01:37:35,667 --> 01:37:37,500
Hmm... interesting.

1641
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:39,583
You'll lose your severance.

1642
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,083
I'll survive it.

1643
01:37:42,167 --> 01:37:43,792
If you say so. All the best.

1644
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:46,625
But Liah here and I, will crush you.

1645
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:47,667
Probably.

1646
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:52,125
But she's coming with me.

1647
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:55,208
Impossible!

1648
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:56,875
You've got to be joking.

1649
01:37:57,167 --> 01:37:58,250
I'll sue the two of you.

1650
01:37:58,417 --> 01:38:01,042
-Tunde, there's nothing to sue for.
-Mm-hmm.

1651
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:02,750
You own Aniya.

1652
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:04,375
And all the work from it.

1653
01:38:04,542 --> 01:38:06,667
We'll be starting from scratch.

1654
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,667
So, we wish you all the best in life.

1655
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,750
And we'll try not to crush you.

1656
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,083
The look on his face was everything

1657
01:38:22,167 --> 01:38:23,667
-I could have hoped for.
-[sighs]

1658
01:38:23,792 --> 01:38:26,375
[chuckles]
I'm glad I could have given you that.

1659
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:30,875
You're not joining me, I take it?

1660
01:38:31,167 --> 01:38:32,167
No.

1661
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:34,000
No, I'm not.

1662
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,458
If you had apologized at least once
for everything,

1663
01:38:37,542 --> 01:38:39,208
I probably would have considered.

1664
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:44,042
So what are you going to do?

1665
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:46,625
Whatever I please.

1666
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:54,375
Hm.

1667
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:13,583
Can we talk?

1668
01:39:21,917 --> 01:39:25,250
I see a man upon the shore.

1669
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:32,625
And he's limping,
with blood gushing from his legs.

1670
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:37,458
And his mistress
is dressing him with a bandage.

1671
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:41,542
Talk to me. Please.

1672
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:49,167
He chooses to ignore her
and focus on what's important.

1673
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:53,875
Trying to stop the bleeding
after she shot him.

1674
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:59,208
She tries to explain
that it was a mistake.

1675
01:40:00,167 --> 01:40:02,167
And she didn't mean it.

1676
01:40:04,542 --> 01:40:06,833
It's not about intentions.

1677
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:09,375
It's about what you do.

1678
01:40:09,792 --> 01:40:14,042
That's why her paramour
is running from her.

1679
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:20,000
[Liah sighs] Can you just stop, please,
so I can apologize, Lekan.

1680
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,458
He realized that the apology was a trap.

1681
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:28,375
He let her kiss him anyway.

1682
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:34,042
Lekan, I won an award today.
Best Ad Of The Year

1683
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:35,750
for Access.

1684
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:40,292
Awards are not important.

1685
01:40:49,875 --> 01:40:53,750
Lekan, as I stood on that stage,

1686
01:40:54,042 --> 01:40:56,208
in front of that crowd,

1687
01:40:57,875 --> 01:41:00,667
I realized that nothing mattered,

1688
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:02,917
because you were not there.

1689
01:41:04,167 --> 01:41:08,042
And so, I came here... for you.

1690
01:41:10,667 --> 01:41:13,833
You're supposed to throw the ball.

1691
01:41:14,792 --> 01:41:16,500
And you're supposed to kiss me.

1692
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:40,667
Her asking for a kiss,

1693
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:47,458
surprised,
but awakened a greater passion in him.

1694
01:41:50,542 --> 01:41:51,792
