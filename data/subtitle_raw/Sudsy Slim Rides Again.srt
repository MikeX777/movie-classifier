1
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:13,405
(light music)

2
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:14,238
- Roar.

3
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,249
(triumphal music)

4
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:38,977
(light music)

5
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:29,204
(ominous music)

6
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,000
(dramatic music)

7
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:58,142
(guns firing)

8
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,280
(dramatic music)

9
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,196
(cracking thunder)

10
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:13,795
(triumphal music)

11
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,213
- And that folks, is the story
of our very own, Sudsy Slim.

12
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,810
Now our little town Scratcher Pass

13
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,600
has grown quite a bit since Sudsy's time.

14
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,570
And there's even been stories about

15
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,090
a treasure of gold that Sudsy had hidden.

16
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,660
But to this day, it's never been found.

17
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,440
Any questions?

18
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,700
Yeah, go right on ahead.

19
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,340
- Can we still find gold here?

20
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,590
- Well, unfortunately the gold ran out

21
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,150
in the 1920s, but since
then the towns people

22
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,180
found something that is
just as exciting as gold.

23
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,090
Can you guess what it is?

24
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:12,923
- Diamonds?

25
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:15,520
- No, no, not diamonds.

26
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,410
- Rubies?

27
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,160
- Yeah, rubies would've been good.

28
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,783
But what the towns people
found was asbestos.

29
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,740
Yeah, this entire
mountain is covered in it.

30
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,973
Check out this cool asbestos rock.

31
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,663
Here kid, you can keep that as a souvenir.

32
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,650
Unfortunately for reasons
that we won't go into

33
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,280
asbestos isn't as sought after these days

34
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,623
as we would have hoped.

35
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,650
And now for even more fun.

36
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,130
My friend Wally here
will take you on a tour

37
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,180
of some of the actual asbestos mines

38
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,923
that used to be in production.

39
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,520
Now kids, if you're
good I'm sure that Wally

40
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,072
will let you use one of his pick axes

41
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:02,340
so you can do a little
asbestos mining of your own.

42
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,440
- Is this really safe?

43
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,673
- Oh yeah, Wally's been
doing it his whole life.

44
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:09,863
- Please follow me.

45
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:14,156
(funky music)

46
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:47,780
(groaning)

47
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
- [Burt] We made it!

48
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,384
Hurry up.

49
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:54,134
(dramatic music)

50
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,099
- [Old Woman] Help!

51
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,128
(dramatic music)

52
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,770
- Give it up, Ripper.

53
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,750
There's no way out.

54
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,970
- Have it your way.

55
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,870
But I'm adding another one to my list.

56
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,773
And this one's on you.

57
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,852
(dramatic music)

58
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,767
(guns firing)

59
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,934
(meowing)

60
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:51,762
- [Old Woman] He shot my cat!

61
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:54,512
(dramatic music)

62
00:09:58,256 --> 00:09:59,460
- I need to catch my breath.

63
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,020
- What, god, we, we don't
have time for, come on.

64
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,690
I told you from the beginning
to work on your cardio.

65
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,087
- Last thing I wanted to do was toned up

66
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,523
and start looking
attractive in that place.

67
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,303
So now that we're out, what's
this big plan of yours?

68
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,680
You don't need to keep it secret anymore.

69
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,910
- It's simple.

70
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,023
We steal a car and we
drive to Canada, done.

71
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,090
- I like the plan.

72
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,923
- Great.

73
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:27,010
- It is simple.

74
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,843
- Don't care.

75
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,280
- What car do you wanna take?

76
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,240
- All right, new plan.

77
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,290
We hike 'til we find a car.

78
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,290
We steal that car and we drive to Canada.

79
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,083
It's a simple plan.

80
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:45,945
- Right.

81
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,560
- You're the one with the map!

82
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,393
- Right.

83
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,293
- It's like breaking out of
prison with my sister's kids.

84
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,130
- There's actually roads
all over the place.

85
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,030
- Great, pick one.

86
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,320
- There's a city close by.

87
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,520
It's called Lidel Rock.

88
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,370
- Called what?

89
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,716
Little Rock?

90
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:10,549
- It's right here.

91
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:12,980
Yeah, you just take the 30 up to the 430

92
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,920
and it takes you right in.

93
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,670
- Little Rock's in.

94
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,133
Little Rock's in Arkansas!

95
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,793
We're in Alaska!

96
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,100
It doesn't, it doesn't matter.

97
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,070
- What are we gonna do?

98
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,220
- I don't need it now.

99
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,867
- What are we gonna do?

100
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,120
- We don't need a map.

101
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,790
We don't need a map.

102
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,830
The guards talk about a
little town in the mountains.

103
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,080
Simple, we hike to the
mountains, we find a car,

104
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,238
we steal that car, and we drive to Canada.

105
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,626
- What's the name of it?

106
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:46,221
- It doesn't matter
what the name of it is!

107
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,210
We hike to the mountains.

108
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,480
We find a car, we steal that car

109
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,680
and we drive to Canada.

110
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,730
- Okay.

111
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,563
- Simple.

112
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,981
(light music)

113
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:03,793
- Isn't Canada that way, Burt?

114
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,753
Wait up.

115
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:10,315
(funky music)

116
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,070
- It's clothes.

117
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,517
Let's hit that clothes line.

118
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:55,051
(rushing water)

119
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:59,117
(grunting)

120
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:09,533
Get, get something on.

121
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,803
What are you wearing?

122
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,070
- It's the only thing that fit me.

123
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,900
- You look like your mother.

124
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,800
- Thank you, Burt.

125
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,720
- Hey, get against the wall.

126
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,680
There's people, there's people.

127
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,610
Get against the wall.

128
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,250
Get against the wall!

129
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,950
- There's somebody over there.

130
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,863
- Hey!

131
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,072
(whistling)

132
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,710
It's a dummy.

133
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:35,424
(upbeat music)

134
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:43,433
- All right.

135
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,960
Over there is the house

136
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,730
of our current mayor and over here

137
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,420
we have the Scratcher Pass jail

138
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,750
with US Deputy Marshal James
M. Schuss standing guard.

139
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,450
We are currently working on getting

140
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,700
a grant for a more
masculine representation

141
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,200
of our marshal here but
until that time comes

142
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,880
the Mayor has generously
donated this from his, um

143
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,263
private collection, yeah.

144
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,920
It was actually right
here on this very street

145
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,480
that the famous gun battle took place.

146
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,140
Sudsy along with two of his gang members

147
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,090
were mortally wounded.

148
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,410
Of course, back in
Sudsy's day Scratcher Pass

149
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,710
wasn't quite as large.

150
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,570
There were fewer buildings
and there was just

151
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,780
a muddy road.

152
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,143
Do we have any questions?

153
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,493
- Uh, yes you in the
purple blouse, uh shirt.

154
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,203
- Thank you.

155
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,330
I was just wondering, this Sudsy guy

156
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,853
instead of getting into
a gunfight and dying,

157
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,780
wanted to drive to say, Canada.

158
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,550
Which direction would he go?

159
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,410
- Interesting, never
been asked that before.

160
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,243
- Smooth.

161
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:57,400
- Well seeing is how Scratcher Pass was

162
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,730
and still is off the road system,

163
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,250
and there were no cars around here

164
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,610
in the early 1900s, I'd
say Sudsy would have

165
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,740
to travel the 50 plus miles
by foot, horse, or dog sled

166
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,180
that direction to the
nearest town, Gangrene Gulch.

167
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,493
And then from there it's
another 200 miles to Canada.

168
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,930
But of course today he would just hop

169
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,423
on a plane and fly out.

170
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,150
Any other questions, no?

171
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,630
All right well let me just take

172
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,320
this opportunity to say thank you so much

173
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,970
for being part of the
Sudsy Slim experience.

174
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,010
May I remind you that our gift shop

175
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,730
is open until 6:00 and we are having

176
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,730
a two for one special
of Sudsy Slim lip balm

177
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,670
and asbestos oven mitts.

178
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,627
So check it out.

179
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:46,698
(light music)

180
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,756
- What are we gonna do, Burt?

181
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
- Shut up and follow me.

182
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,628
(light music)

183
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,380
- Hey look, I'm Sudsy Slim.

184
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,703
- Beat it, kid!

185
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,883
Or you'll end up on the
side of a milk carton.

186
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,787
I don't like people touching me.

187
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:37,124
(cackling)

188
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,063
- Oh no.

189
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,330
- Well Gladys that's the
last tour of the day.

190
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,440
I'm gonna go upstairs and change

191
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,610
and then head to the Slippery Nickel

192
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,670
and get something to eat.

193
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,810
- Sounds good, sweetheart.

194
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,460
I might see ya there later.

195
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,090
After I close up me and Hobart

196
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,300
are gonna go meet Snake Eyes and toss back

197
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,820
a couple boiler makers.

198
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,120
- All right, see ya there.

199
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,480
- Oh hey, real quick, one last question.

200
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,180
How often do those planes
come in and outta town here?

201
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,740
- Every four days.

202
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,881
- Right.

203
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,714
- Didn't they tell you guys that

204
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:13,040
when you flew in here?

205
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,530
- Oh I'm sure they did.

206
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,931
We were just sleeping.

207
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,070
- Mm.

208
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,710
(flashing camera)

209
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,660
- [Burt] Mountains.

210
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:27,760
(ominous music)

211
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,200
Quit touching, what?

212
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,033
- Look.

213
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:33,550
(ominous music)

214
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,237
- Say cheese.

215
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:58,005
(flashing camera)

216
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,923
- That'll be five dollars, please.

217
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,970
Uh, for you fellas it's
on the house today.

218
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,803
Have a good one.

219
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,778
(ominous music)

220
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,090
- That's right, you guys missed

221
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,003
the first part of the tour
featuring Sudsy himself.

222
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,190
- That thing gives me the willies.

223
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:34,590
- Woof, he's something all right.

224
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,913
- You're right about that.

225
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,900
Living, he was the town's worst enemy

226
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,060
but ironically dead, he's
the only thing keeping

227
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,103
this town alive.

228
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,480
His story and his corpse are
what bring in the tourists.

229
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,660
Without him, we'd be finished.

230
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,630
- So without this dried up mountain pirate

231
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,830
this whole down just--

232
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,133
- Pass away like a fart in the wind.

233
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,300
- Pretty much.

234
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,133
- Classy.

235
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,290
- Hey, where is his gun?

236
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,280
- It actually went missing
after the gun fight.

237
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,660
- Kate?

238
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,430
Can I borrow you for a second?

239
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,453
- Yeah, excuse me, gentlemen.

240
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:20,737
(dramatic music)

241
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:23,119
- Hey.

242
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,083
I know how we're getting outta here.

243
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:32,327
(dramatic music)

244
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:44,743
(ethereal music)

245
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,940
All right, like I said.

246
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,890
The plan is simple.

247
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,480
We steal Sudsy.

248
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,120
We ransom him for some cash

249
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,101
and then we catch the
next flight to Canada.

250
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,880
- Is it me or does he
seem a lot more menacing

251
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,210
than he did earlier?

252
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,120
- He just looks like a
bag of that jerky shoved

253
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,333
into a cowboy suit.

254
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,323
- Looks like his eyes are
following me wherever I go.

255
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,120
Not feeling to sure about this, Burt.

256
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,763
- Look, are we doing this or not?

257
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,603
We're doing it.

258
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:44,436
Glad we agree.

259
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,840
Help me pry this thing off of here.

260
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:54,084
(dramatic music)

261
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:28,860
What are you standing there for?

262
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,560
- I ain't touching him, he's dead.

263
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,593
- Grab him.

264
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,060
Afraid he's just gonna jump out

265
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
and eat your brains?

266
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:39,329
(screaming)

267
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:48,744
- Ow.

268
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,370
- That was close.

269
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,023
Almost over reacted.

270
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,496
- To me there's no wrong thing
you could put on a pizza.

271
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:02,987
- Except a Greek pizza.

272
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:04,310
- I am not a fan of anchovies.

273
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,523
I just really don't like the anchovies.

274
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:07,779
- What's the matter with you?

275
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,077
You don't like anchovies?

276
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:10,969
- [Gladys] I don't like
fish, I don't like seafood.

277
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,439
- [Hobart] That's what this place needs.

278
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,272
This place needs a good pizza joint.

279
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:14,270
- Oh that, yeah.

280
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,170
A nice thin crust pizza.

281
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,080
Son of a, I can't find the.

282
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey, wait here just a second.

283
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,700
I think I left something
in the cash register.

284
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,673
I'll be right down.

285
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:23,506
- Well hurry up, I'm thirsty.

286
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:24,760
- I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.

287
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:27,593
- Chicago style or New York style?

288
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:32,543
- For 100 year old dead
guy he is not light.

289
00:23:38,343 --> 00:23:39,410
- [Gladys] Somethings wrong with me.

290
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,579
- [Snake Eyes] You get here
to the end of the world

291
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,354
and you have no life experience.

292
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:45,010
You don't even know what pizza is.

293
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,210
- [Hobart] Do I look lost, fella?

294
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,068
- [Snake Eyes] You've been
spending your time eating all

295
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:52,150
these gophers and stuff,
I mean look at ya.

296
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,800
- [Hobart] I've never had gopher.

297
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:59,075
- Now where did I?

298
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:03,121
I'm gonna check the.

299
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:05,288
(beeping)

300
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:09,515
Now where are you?

301
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:13,103
What, oh man.

302
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,770
(ominous music)

303
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,020
- What do we do?

304
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,437
- Cover his face.

305
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,708
- Oh.

306
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,662
(ominous music)

307
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,510
(screaming)

308
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:04,220
- Did you hear that?

309
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,083
Is that normal?

310
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,963
I don't really.

311
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:08,796
- For her?

312
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:12,344
(wailing)

313
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:13,740
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

314
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,633
What is going on up there?

315
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,350
- Hey, hey, settle.

316
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,183
This ain't helping.

317
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:18,819
Settle down!

318
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:20,456
Now what happened?

319
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:21,703
- He assaulted me.

320
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,118
- Who, who assaulted you?

321
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:25,129
- Sudsy assaulted me.

322
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:25,962
- What?

323
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,150
- I saw him, he ran up the stairs.

324
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,830
I think he's trying to
escape out the back.

325
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,330
He assaulted me!

326
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,533
It was terrible.

327
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,980
- The dead guy assaulted you?

328
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,977
He's behind glass.

329
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,900
- All right, all right, all right.

330
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,330
Stay here with Hobart.

331
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,390
I'll go around back and check it out.

332
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,662
Honestly, god.

333
00:26:46,662 --> 00:26:48,312
- Be careful, oh it was terrible.

334
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,616
- Breathe.

335
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:53,944
(heavy breathing)

336
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,611
(ominous music)

337
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,033
- Sudsy?

338
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,563
Come out, come out wherever you are.

339
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,373
What a crock.

340
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:31,367
- What are we gonna do?

341
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,200
What are we gonna do?

342
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,253
What are we gonna do?

343
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:34,086
What are we gonna do?

344
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,160
- Hold this, hold this.

345
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I got an idea.

346
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,770
- What are you doing?

347
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,794
- We're going over.

348
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:42,627
- What?

349
00:27:44,235 --> 00:27:46,568
(screaming)

350
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,010
- Did you hear that?

351
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,510
- It's probably nothing, move.

352
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,290
All right, you go over the rope.

353
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,420
I'll send the stuff after ya.

354
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,873
Look up!

355
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:13,850
Get over here and grab this body.

356
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,893
The one on top.

357
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,808
(grunting)

358
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,973
And the rope.

359
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:28,155
(dramatic music)

360
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,041
- My god, what happened?

361
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,410
Oh!

362
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,243
- Oh.

363
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,023
- Is that a finger in your eye?

364
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,909
- I'm gonna go get the Mayor.

365
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:00,076
(sobbing)

366
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:08,419
- All right, we're clear.

367
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:13,092
(sobbing)

368
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:16,864
Shit, get in the, hide.

369
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:17,697
- Mr. Mayor!

370
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:19,290
- Son, I am so proud of you

371
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,910
for pulling out your own tooth.

372
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,743
- That's right.

373
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,800
Tonight you get to leave
it under your pillow

374
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,810
and while you're sleeping

375
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,660
the tooth fairy is gonna
come flying through

376
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,150
that window and leave
you something special.

377
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,710
- Hide!

378
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,460
(dramatic music)

379
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,591
- Oh, Mr. Mayor!

380
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:42,591
I gotta go get the Mayor,
I gotta get the Mayor.

381
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,690
- That was a freebie.

382
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,930
- What was a freebie?

383
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,763
- Get over here.

384
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:52,532
(dramatic music)

385
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,818
- Hey Burt, I can't.
- What, what?

386
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:06,105
- I just, it's too heavy.

387
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,181
- I'll help!
- It's too heavy.

388
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,181
- I'll help.

389
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,117
- Thank you, Burt.

390
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:15,480
- There, better?
- No.

391
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,330
- [Burt] Come on!

392
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:20,024
- Was he missing a finger
before we stole him?

393
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:25,091
- [Mayor] I beg you
madam, contain yourself.

394
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,210
What is the matter, what is?

395
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,428
Oh my, what happened to Snake Eyes?

396
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:33,217
- Sudsy bush whacked him.

397
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:35,303
- And he left this in my eyeball.

398
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,763
(light music)

399
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:50,400
- Holy zombie apocalypse.

400
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:56,074
(protestors clamoring)

401
00:30:58,062 --> 00:31:00,382
- You don't have nine lives.

402
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:03,632
(protesters clamoring)

403
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:17,145
(phones ringing)

404
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,040
- [Receptionist] ABCD?

405
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,670
Yes, it's really a thing.

406
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,500
- Mark Hucksta for AKN News.

407
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,880
On the scene where an angry crowd

408
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,010
is protesting the tragic shooting

409
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,340
of a beloved cat named Mr. Tibbles.

410
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,120
The atmosphere is highly charged

411
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,300
with tension and the smell of Bengay.

412
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,260
Police have released the video footage

413
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,430
of the incident hoping to calm things down

414
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,600
but if anything, it has
only added fuel to the fire.

415
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,730
Watch.

416
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,410
We can see the ABCD agent pointing his gun

417
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,880
at Mr. Tibbles, his owner,
and an unidentified man

418
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,070
whom I assume is a family friend.

419
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,840
Wait, wait, we just got word

420
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,410
that the unidentified man might

421
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,830
have been a serial killer.

422
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,646
So he's either a family
friend or a serial killer.

423
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:08,479
(chuckling)

424
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,140
We've edited out the actual shooting

425
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,550
due to it's horrifying graphic nature

426
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,010
but we can see the aftermath

427
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:18,074
as the ABCD agent walks
over to inspect his victim.

428
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:21,403
That's just something you
never quite get used to seeing.

429
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,810
Things are getting pretty heated here

430
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,040
as you can hear in the background.

431
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,780
You get the sense that
with any slight provocation

432
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,222
anything could happen.

433
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:31,050
- [Protester] Fake news!

434
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,883
- Oh!

435
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:34,940
- Ha!

436
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,310
Grover, Grover.

437
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,160
- Do I come down to the bingo Parlor

438
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,918
and throw bricks at you?

439
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:41,180
- [Protester] You suck!

440
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,493
- Hey man, so you seen today's paper?

441
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,533
- Mr. Tibbles riots enter third day.

442
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,960
ABCD agent or heartless kitty assassin?

443
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,033
Are you kidding me?

444
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:58,385
(chuckling)

445
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:01,766
- Oh man.

446
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,410
- Can you believe this garbage?

447
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,860
The press is calling Mr.
Tibbles a kitten now.

448
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,880
That cat is over 14 years old

449
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,230
and lost it's tail to diabetes.

450
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,320
He was practically dead before I shot him.

451
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,620
Aside from grazing him, that stupid cat

452
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,710
is very much alive.

453
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,980
- Look, you caught a serial killer

454
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,700
that's been terrorizing
the city for weeks.

455
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,430
You did what you had to do.

456
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,183
There are a lot of
grateful people out there.

457
00:33:29,183 --> 00:33:30,764
- [Protester] You suck!

458
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:33,030
- Well, maybe not out
there, but out there.

459
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,000
- It certainly doesn't feel like it.

460
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,250
- Sit down, I do have
some good news for you.

461
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,160
The review board came back

462
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,400
and declared your shooting
of the ripper as justified.

463
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,723
It's my privilege to
give you your gun back.

464
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,870
- That's good.

465
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,523
- I also have a case for you.

466
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:53,290
It appears to be a missing persons.

467
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,223
- We don't normally handle those.

468
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,740
Scratcher Pass.

469
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,380
You're sending us to Scratcher Pass?

470
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,230
- No, I'm sending you to Scratcher Pass.

471
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,010
Agent Grover will hold the fort
down here while you're gone.

472
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,070
I figured it's a good chance

473
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,730
to get you outta town for a little bit.

474
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,520
You know, until this
Tibbles thing blows over

475
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,740
and the cat ladies go home.

476
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,440
- I don't even know where this place is.

477
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,580
- It's off the road systems.

478
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,060
You'll be flying out.

479
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,410
The only info we have is
from a voice message left

480
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,560
by the town mayor.

481
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,463
The details are a bit scarce.

482
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,150
It seems a mudslide
took out the phone lines

483
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,790
and there's no cell
service up there, either.

484
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,270
You'll be flying out.

485
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,513
I booked you on a charter.

486
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,410
You have an hour to
get your stuff together

487
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,248
and head to the airport.

488
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,927
- [Protesters] Shame,
shame, shame on Sherman.

489
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:45,020
- Oh and Sherman, take your time

490
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,837
while you're out there to see the sights.

491
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,862
(splattering eggs)

492
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:52,613
Maybe do a little gold panning, fishing.

493
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:55,181
- [Protester] You suck!

494
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:56,663
- Why don't you grow some facial hair?

495
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,945
A lot of facial hair.

496
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:03,414
(splattering eggs)

497
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:06,247
(uplifting music)

498
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:27,354
- Wow, it's absolutely beautiful out here.

499
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,630
I bet you never get tired of the scenery.

500
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,713
No, no, no, no.

501
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:39,546
No, no, no.

502
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:43,410
Uh, okay.

503
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,453
I can fly this.

504
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,970
No I can't, I can't fly this.

505
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,803
Don't be dead.

506
00:35:48,803 --> 00:35:51,960
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

507
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,050
Please don't be dead!

508
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:55,653
- Be there in 10 minutes.

509
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,663
Wow, look at that scenery.

510
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,377
I never get tired of looking at that.

511
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,114
(ethereal music)

512
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:43,540
- Hello.

513
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,840
My name's Kate.

514
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,310
I wasn't expecting any tourists in today.

515
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,450
How was your flight?

516
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,550
- Uneventful, you know.

517
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,181
Aside from my pilot being Rip Van Winkle.

518
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:53,014
- Oh.

519
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:53,847
- Kate.
- Hey.

520
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:54,887
- Here's the mail for Froderick

521
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,708
and the newspaper that
I promised the Mayor.

522
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:57,541
- Perfect.

523
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,400
- Good to see ya again.
- Bye.

524
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,503
- Good flying with ya.

525
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,520
- I'm agent Sherman with

526
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,630
the Alaska Bureau of Criminal Detection.

527
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,840
We got a report of a missing persons.

528
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,790
- Oh, wonderful.

529
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,020
I knew the Mayor called for help

530
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,890
but I didn't realize
anyone got the message

531
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,950
because a mudslide took
out our phone lines

532
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,100
at about the same time.

533
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,710
- Here I am.

534
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,130
- Alaska Bureau of Criminal Detection.

535
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,610
Is that really a thing?

536
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:26,760
- Yes, it's really a
thing that I work for.

537
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,793
- Huh, never heard of it.

538
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,140
- We're getting a website.

539
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,060
So Kate, could you fill me
in on some of the details?

540
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,540
Who it is, the circumstances

541
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,560
of their disappearance?

542
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,823
- Well, the who is Sudsy Slim.

543
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,420
As far as the circumstances,

544
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,030
I think I better let the
Mayor fill you in on those.

545
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,383
Town is just two miles up the mountain.

546
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:53,138
(funky music)

547
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,680
Hello, Mayor.

548
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,513
- Oh.

549
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:17,540
- Here's you're newspaper.

550
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,010
Thanks for letting me
borrow the four wheeler.

551
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,790
I had to get the mail to Froderick.

552
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,810
And guess who I bumped
into at the air strip.

553
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,410
This is Agent Sherman.

554
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,840
- Holy rug!

555
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,590
- I beg your pardon.

556
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,460
- Your rug, it's got holes in it.

557
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,590
- It's a hard wood floor.

558
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,960
- Mayor, this is the gentlemen

559
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,192
that's gonna help us
with our little problem.

560
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,240
- Oh, Agent Sherman!

561
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,300
Thank you for coming so quickly.

562
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,810
We're terribly worried about our Sudsy.

563
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,140
Now some introductions are in order.

564
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,350
This is my assistant Hobart.

565
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,260
This is Mr. Snake Eyes he, he.

566
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,643
- I fix things.

567
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:54,476
- Yes.

568
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:55,309
- And this is Digger.

569
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:59,040
He's our local undertaker
and outhouse engineer.

570
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,353
- Outhouse engineer?

571
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,520
- I like digging holes.

572
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
It don't matter to me
what you fill 'em with.

573
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,290
Bodies or turds.

574
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,819
- Ah.

575
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:10,820
- Now, now, now please sit, sit, sit.

576
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,243
Now, Agent Sherman.

577
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,670
Have we met somewhere before?

578
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,550
- Uh, no, no reason we should have met.

579
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,700
- Ah, but your face is so familiar.

580
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,120
I just can't seem to put my finger on it.

581
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,609
- Nah, just one of those faces, I guess.

582
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:27,520
Can I borrow your newspaper.

583
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,180
I love the Sudoku puzzle.

584
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,070
- Yeah of course, help yourself.

585
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,903
- Thank you.

586
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:34,970
(meowing)

587
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,940
- Oh dear, oh I am so terribly sorry.

588
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,580
Can't imagine what's gotten into Higgins.

589
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,030
He's usually so well behaved.

590
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,970
He must know you're a cat person.

591
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,500
- Well, I do have a history with cats.

592
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,960
Um, anyway.

593
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,610
Mr. Mayor could you fill me in

594
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,550
on this missing persons case.

595
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,160
Kate said the man's name is Sudsy Slim?

596
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,430
- Yes, that's correct.

597
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,740
- Okay, and what makes you
think he's actually missing?

598
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,530
Did he not show up for
work the other day or what?

599
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,170
- He did not show up for
work, that is correct.

600
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,360
- And is it safe to assume this
is unusual behavior for him?

601
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,333
- Incredibly unusual,
he's just always there.

602
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,690
- Now is it possible that
there was foul play involved?

603
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,210
- Agent Sherman the thing
is, Sudsy just seems

604
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,210
to have run off into the woods one night.

605
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,783
- After he assaulted some people.

606
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,720
- Is Sudsy usually violent?

607
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,150
- Well, he does have
a history of violence.

608
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,490
Although it's been awhile.

609
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,400
- How long?

610
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,263
- Oh, about 100 years.

611
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,243
- Of course.

612
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,820
- Sherman, wait!

613
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,630
- When's the next plane out of here?

614
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,270
- Four days.

615
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,270
- Please, Sherman just listen to me.

616
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,970
We could really use your help.

617
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,450
- I catch armed robbers, serial killers,

618
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,840
really bad people.

619
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,317
I don't go chasing after people

620
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,267
that have been dead for over 100 years.

621
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,800
- It's not gonna work.

622
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,216
You see a mudslide took
out our phone lines and--

623
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:21,049
- Phone lines, yeah.

624
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:21,882
That's what I heard.

625
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,470
What about the cell tower?

626
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,570
- They were next to the phone lines.

627
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,660
Look, I'm sorry okay.

628
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,070
But I had to leave out a few small details

629
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,720
to get somebody up here.

630
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,270
If we told the whole truth no
one would have believed us.

631
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,600
- I'm still having a little trouble

632
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,817
with the believing part.

633
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:40,790
You know, because zombies.

634
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,623
- Okay.

635
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,820
At least let me buy you a drink.

636
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,093
It's not like you have
anywhere to go at the moment.

637
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:52,751
(funky music)

638
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,700
- There we go, cranberry juice for you.

639
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,486
Usual for you.

640
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:00,319
- Thank you.

641
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,169
- You're welcome.

642
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,510
- Kate, you do know that this Sudsy thing

643
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,700
is pretty ridiculous, right?

644
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,230
I mean there's no way I
can help you with this.

645
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,930
- You know, the man was a real crap weasel

646
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,480
when he was alive.

647
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,820
I can only imagine what he's like undead.

648
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,520
But this town depends on him.

649
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,120
When he was alive Sudsy and his gang used

650
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,060
to make quite a living conning

651
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,830
and cheating, anyone
that came into this town.

652
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,100
- How'd he end up dying?

653
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,230
- Eventually the brought
in a deputy marshal

654
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,990
to restore law and order.

655
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,530
And things came to a head pretty quickly.

656
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,770
There was a cool spaghetti
western style shootout

657
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,690
on the main street leaving Sudsy

658
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,206
and a couple of his gang members dead.

659
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:45,039
- Ah ha.

660
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:47,150
- This town really needs him.

661
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,570
I mean we all dress the part to make

662
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,490
it fun for the visitors but at the end

663
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,093
of the day, it's Sudsy
that they're here to see.

664
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,780
- Can I get you anything else?

665
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,956
- Oh, no thank you Donka.

666
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:00,789
- Donka?

667
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,330
- Oh, it is gypsy.

668
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,680
By day I am bartender.

669
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,273
But by night I am the all seeing Donka.

670
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,803
Look, I have sign over there.

671
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:15,970
- Is your crystal ball a cantaloupe?

672
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:19,651
(ominous music)

673
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:27,776
(moaning)

674
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:44,074
- Bullets fly, guns blaze,
witnesses see through the haze.

675
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,760
The law man, the law man
falls lifeless to the ground.

676
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,590
His chest is still.

677
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,120
His breath, not a sound.

678
00:43:59,374 --> 00:44:02,707
(crackling electricity)

679
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:11,150
Oh, there.

680
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,023
Small sample, enjoy.

681
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,370
- And you just met Donka.

682
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,180
- I didn't really notice
any other law men in town.

683
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,940
- Nope, you're the only one.

684
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,303
I mean she's picked a couple Superbowl's.

685
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,960
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna
turn in for the night.

686
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,090
- Wait Sherman, before you do

687
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,413
can you just come check
out the crime scene?

688
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,010
- Obviously the plexiglass
goes to Sudsy's coffin?

689
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:48,843
- Yes.

690
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,820
- Judging by the nails
I'd say Sudsy's side

691
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,953
is facing up.

692
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,480
Kate, were these scratches here before?

693
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,283
- No, they weren't.

694
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,703
- It looks like.

695
00:45:11,703 --> 00:45:14,740
- Like he was trying to claw his way out?

696
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,023
Yeah, I know.

697
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,493
- Except a dead guy's not gonna
claw his way out and escape.

698
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,710
(dramatic music)

699
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,483
So, is this our suspect?

700
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,230
- That's him, that's the pervert.

701
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,893
Treating me like some sexy piece of meat.

702
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,500
Though you can't blame a guy for trying.

703
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,333
- Yuck.

704
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:57,213
- So you say you're some
kind of detective fella?

705
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,046
- Uh, yeah.

706
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,070
- Yes, Gladys this is Agent Sherman.

707
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:03,310
He's a member of the Alaska Bureau of,

708
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,010
I'm sorry what was it again?

709
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,810
- Alaska Bureau of Criminal Detection.

710
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,321
- He's an ABCD agent.

711
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:09,154
- Ha!

712
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,562
That sounds like some kind
of Sesame Street thing.

713
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,000
(chuckling)

714
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,470
- Gladys, can you fill me in

715
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,920
on the details of last night?

716
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,700
- Oh yeah, it was terrifying.

717
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,960
See I work here as a
cashier and I came back

718
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,610
late last night because I left
my vodka in cash register.

719
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,275
- Is that what's in your glass right now?

720
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:30,240
(chortle)

721
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,570
- Heaven's no, it's
way too early for that.

722
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,813
This is a martini.

723
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:39,280
- Okay, please continue.

724
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,920
- I was standing right
here behind the counter.

725
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,600
When suddenly I felt
like I was being watched

726
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,320
and the hairs on the
back of my neck started

727
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,630
to get all prickly.

728
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,980
So I went over to the
stairs to investigate

729
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,040
and that's when he jumped
at me and his tongue

730
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,543
was all hanging out.

731
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,061
I think he was trying to french me.

732
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:56,894
- Ugh.

733
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:58,860
- You know, and I'm not
that kind of a girl.

734
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,230
Well, not on the first date.

735
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,050
Well, or not the first 10 minutes

736
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,453
of the first date at least.

737
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,820
So, I screamed and I fell over backwards

738
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,320
and by the time I opened my eyes

739
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,600
I saw him go flying up the stairs

740
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,480
and that is when I ran out screaming.

741
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,630
- Okay, so Gladys was Sudsy
alone when he assaulted you?

742
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,073
- He was all alone and very lusty.

743
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,210
- Oh yeah, of course.

744
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,123
I mean he's been in a box for 100 years.

745
00:47:28,123 --> 00:47:29,870
He's probably ready for a date night.

746
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,480
- All right, I think that's all we need.

747
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,433
Thank you so much for your time, Gladys.

748
00:47:34,363 --> 00:47:37,363
- [Gladys] Now where's that tequila?

749
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:40,683
- Hello?

750
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,530
- Welcome to the Scratcher's
Inn and Post Office.

751
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,300
- Ah, I didn't see you there.

752
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,560
- My apologies.

753
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,610
I was tending to my crops.

754
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,450
- What crops?

755
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,530
- How may I help you today?

756
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,680
- I'm Agent Sherman.

757
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,980
I have a room reservation for here.

758
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,350
- Agent, real estate huh?

759
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,020
- Uh, no.

760
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,973
Alaska Bureau of Criminal Detection.

761
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,990
- ABCD, that's really a thing?

762
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,020
- It's really a thing.

763
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,890
- Do you ever feel kind of stupid

764
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,850
when you have to kick in a door

765
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,070
and scream, "Freeze, ABCD Agent!"

766
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,056
- Do you have my room key?

767
00:48:17,056 --> 00:48:17,889
- Ah.

768
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,610
Room 1102, the annulment suite.

769
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,700
- What's with the orange thing?

770
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,900
- That's for if you drop
it into the outhouse.

771
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,350
You need to retrieve it.

772
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,810
- Okay, please tell me this is clean.

773
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:32,643
- What's clean?

774
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:33,710
- Did you say annulment suite?

775
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,340
- You'll understand when you see it.

776
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,803
- Okay, could you just
please show me to my room?

777
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,430
- Allow me to take your bag.

778
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:00,583
(ominous music)

779
00:49:41,306 --> 00:49:44,306
(crackling thunder)

780
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,527
(ominous music)

781
00:50:28,436 --> 00:50:31,853
- [Donka Voiceover]
The lawman, the lawman.

782
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,490
- Bullets fly, guns blaze,

783
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,523
witnesses see through the haze.

784
00:50:44,997 --> 00:50:48,400
- [Donka Voiceover]
The lawman, the lawman.

785
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,720
- The law man falls
lifeless to the ground.

786
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,310
His chest is still.

787
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,893
His breath, not a sound.

788
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:59,232
(maniacal laughing)

789
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,469
- Wanna spoon?

790
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:07,636
(wailing)

791
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,130
(light music)

792
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,450
- All right, I back
tracked, found his arm.

793
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:50,760
Also there's a cabin back there.

794
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,960
We must've passed it in the dark.

795
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,300
We can probably use it as a hideout.

796
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,870
- I don't like the way he's looking at me.

797
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,190
- He's also missing some more fingers

798
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,430
but you know, nothing important.

799
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,580
It's like keeping
together a jigsaw puzzle.

800
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,700
Here, give me that tape
from the gift shop.

801
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:11,727
The duct tape, from the.

802
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:14,997
I know, it's fine.

803
00:52:14,997 --> 00:52:16,772
Yeah, that's right, whatever.

804
00:52:16,772 --> 00:52:18,143
That's fine, I'll just do it.

805
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,840
Hopefully this, will keep him
from losing any more pieces.

806
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,293
- He just stares at me.

807
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:33,850
- Don't you think if
he was gonna come alive

808
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,100
he woulda done it before now?

809
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,350
Like when he was fresh?

810
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,400
- Yeah well, what about the mummy?

811
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,420
- What mummy?

812
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,140
- You know, a mummy.

813
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,800
Thousands of years old, the mummy's curse.

814
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,850
He returns from the dead

815
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,260
to claim his victims for
disturbing his rest, the mummy.

816
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,570
- You think that happened?

817
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,693
That that's real life?

818
00:52:57,038 --> 00:52:57,873
All right, all right.

819
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,203
Okay.

820
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,270
Look at him.

821
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,320
He is against the trees.

822
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,400
He's in the grass.

823
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,463
He's hanging out with us.

824
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,113
Enjoying nature's bounty.

825
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,230
I like to believe that if
he came to life right now

826
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,840
he'd thank us for taking
him camping, right?

827
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,250
- No, he's angry.

828
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,083
- I'm ang!

829
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:39,310
Okay, exhaustion seems to
have made you a bit weird.

830
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,140
Why don't you come over

831
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,320
and grab your traveling companion

832
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,183
and we'll go back to that
cabin, get some rest.

833
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:57,390
And, and visit this anew tomorrow.

834
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,780
- Right.

835
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,250
- Yeah, okay.

836
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,083
- Right.

837
00:54:02,343 --> 00:54:04,843
(light music)

838
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:32,980
- Good morning.

839
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,500
This is your wake up call.

840
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,910
And I need to borrow a pair of your socks.

841
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:40,360
- Wake up call, socks?

842
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,023
The door was locked.

843
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,690
- The locks here don't actually work.

844
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,463
They serve as more of
a decorative function.

845
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,000
- What?

846
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,250
Why are you in here?

847
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,810
- I have a message from Kate.

848
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:59,610
Both here and Alex are awaiting
you at the Slippery Nickel.

849
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,283
Also, you're out of toilet paper.

850
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:05,783
And toothpaste.

851
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,410
- So, how's the food here?

852
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,150
- Best place to eat in town.

853
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,030
- What my sister fails to say

854
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,110
is that it's one of the
only places to eat in town.

855
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,720
Gosh, I'd kill for a McDonald's.

856
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,510
Well, not really kill.

857
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:30,040
Figuratively speaking because
that would be illegal, right?

858
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,890
- Last I checked.

859
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:33,180
Tell me, Alex.

860
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,610
What do you like to do for fun?

861
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,813
- I like to invent things, look!

862
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:40,000
I made this the other day.

863
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,423
I call it a shock bow.

864
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,060
- Is that a spork?

865
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:44,893
- Yeah!

866
00:55:44,893 --> 00:55:45,830
- I wouldn't.

867
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:48,310
That thing is like a taser on steroids.

868
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,860
- Oh, very nice.

869
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,200
- Yeah, I shot my sister
in the leg the other day.

870
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,380
- Yeah, put a hole in my favorite jeans.

871
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,640
Although I could charge my
phone just by holding it

872
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,020
for the next couple of hours.

873
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,213
- You're welcome.

874
00:56:02,979 --> 00:56:05,812
(triumphal music)

875
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,423
- Pardon the interruption.

876
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:14,340
We were hoping to speak with
Agent Sherman for a moment.

877
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,360
- By all means.

878
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,430
- Well, we're in a bit of a predicament.

879
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,900
You see our town relies heavily,

880
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,620
or should I say solely on tourism

881
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,110
for it's survival.

882
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:26,590
And the thing that sets our town apart

883
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:31,250
from other towns is that we
have Sudsy's, well corpse,

884
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,950
for people to see.

885
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,320
Now that Sudsy has disappeared things

886
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,800
have become rather desperate

887
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,630
and so we put our
contingency plan into effect

888
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,400
but it didn't work as
well as we had hoped.

889
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,540
- I put old man Peterson
in Sudsy's coffin.

890
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,400
- What?

891
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,980
- Don't worry, Peterson's been
dead at least three months.

892
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,300
- Isn't that awesome?

893
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,480
- Um, Alex why don't you wait outside.

894
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,820
We need to talk to the Mayor.

895
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,653
- Fine.

896
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,823
- Yes, good lad.

897
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,990
Yes, what Digger and
Hobart are trying to say

898
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:07,990
is that we put a substitute
body in Sudsy's place.

899
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,380
For tourists.

900
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,310
But as the body had been in the ground

901
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,650
for some months it had become

902
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,550
the home of several thousand worms

903
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,960
and when the body began to warm up it--

904
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,230
- He split open, like a birthday pinata.

905
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,430
- It's a bit of a PR nightmare.

906
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:26,110
- Yeah, and it's highly illegal.

907
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,770
- Oh we stuffed him back in his hole.

908
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,900
- Yeah, it's all good.

909
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,880
Plus we got a whole mess of fishing worms.

910
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,150
- Now the reason that I have come

911
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,480
is that I am putting together a team

912
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,050
of men to track down Sudsy.

913
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,290
But I need a person to lead the team.

914
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,960
A person of experience.

915
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,230
And I would like that person to be you.

916
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,770
- You want me to form a posse?

917
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:53,360
- Well, I like to think of
it more as a recovery team.

918
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,365
- I see.

919
00:57:54,365 --> 00:57:58,080
- You are an experienced law man.

920
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,980
All we need you to do is to find Sudsy

921
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,520
and bring him back so we can put him back

922
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,920
on display where he belongs.

923
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,210
- And we'll probably
have to kill him again.

924
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,700
- What Hobart is trying to say

925
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,800
is that as Sudsy is already dead

926
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,160
why there's no crime in
leaving him in that state.

927
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,070
Even if you have to shoot him a few times

928
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,020
in the process.

929
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,410
- Your recovery team
is sounding a lot like

930
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:23,710
an assassination team.

931
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:28,263
- Oh you would have some
of the town's top men.

932
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,040
You will have some warm
bodies to fill out your team.

933
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,430
- We might be able to get a real bonafide

934
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,793
Indian guide and tracker.

935
00:58:40,247 --> 00:58:42,997
(ethereal music)

936
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:50,770
- Hello.

937
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,320
- Raj could be our tracker.

938
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,240
- Did somebody order the pork vindaloo?

939
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,860
- Oh that would be me!

940
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,500
- Ah, my friend.

941
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,940
- Raj here runs the Indian food stand

942
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,860
at the end of the road.

943
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,870
What do you call that Raj?

944
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,030
- Ah yes, Kid Curries.

945
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,250
And I must say I am proud
to be farthest north

946
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,683
curry stand in the whole US.

947
00:59:08,683 --> 00:59:13,683
- Yes, and he also moonlights
as a hiker and trail guide.

948
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:14,623
- Yes, yes.

949
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:16,240
I heard you mention tracker?

950
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,100
- We need a tracker.

951
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,160
Someone who can find things.

952
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,330
- I am more of a hiker, not a tracker.

953
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,440
- Are you kidding me, Raj.

954
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,630
Last week I lost my
keys, couldn't find them.

955
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:28,000
Looked everywhere, you
delivered my dum aloo

956
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,905
and found them right away.

957
00:59:29,905 --> 00:59:32,570
- That's because I
found them in your door.

958
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,250
- Ah, but you also found my cat Higgins

959
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,160
when I told you he was
missing a few weeks back.

960
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,993
- No, no, no.

961
00:59:37,993 --> 00:59:41,090
He was pooping in the
flower pot outside my stand.

962
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,500
Right okay, so I have found a few things

963
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,030
but I don't think that qualifies me

964
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:47,470
to go tracking down.

965
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,510
What is this you're tracking?

966
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:51,930
- Oh, we're gonna hunt down
Sudsy and bring him back.

967
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,690
- Okay, let me get this straight.

968
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,810
You want me help you track
down a 100 year old zombie

969
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:59,760
that goes leaping rooftop to rooftop

970
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,280
poking out random people's eyes?

971
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,740
- Yes, that's right.

972
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:06,340
- You know, in my culture
we put our dead in boats,

973
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,020
light them on fire, then
send them down the Ganges

974
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,840
so we don't have problems like this.

975
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,137
- That's funny, I never would
have figured you for a viking.

976
01:00:15,137 --> 01:00:16,290
(sighing)

977
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,123
- I'm out.

978
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:19,390
- What?

979
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:22,163
- Well it's a shame about
your food stand, Raj.

980
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,833
- Pardon me?

981
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,200
- Well your lease is up
at the end of the month

982
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
and Duck Won has an
interest in establishing

983
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,500
a Korean food stand.

984
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,783
I understand that he makes
a kimchi that's to die for.

985
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:37,993
And we really need everyone
on board here, Raj.

986
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:42,390
- Fine, but I'm not going to like this.

987
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,660
- Excellent.

988
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,603
Now, Agent Sherman will you lead them?

989
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,410
- I have to admit I am interested

990
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:50,780
in seeing how this goes.

991
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,050
And I don't think it would hurt

992
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,250
to do a little poking around.

993
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,200
But, mostly to ensure that
there's no unnecessary

994
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,480
assassinating going on.

995
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,120
- Well, suit yourself.

996
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,820
As long as we get our Sudsy back.

997
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,080
Gear up, men!

998
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,523
You leave in an hour.

999
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,753
Thank you, Donka.

1000
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:12,503
(dramatic music)

1001
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,640
- All right, do we have everyone?

1002
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,150
Looks like you're all loaded for bear.

1003
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,530
What's this, no gun?

1004
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,730
- I really don't like guns.

1005
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:49,890
It's bear mace.

1006
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,550
You know, for bear.

1007
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,423
- More like hiker seasoning.

1008
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,320
- Hey, I've used this once before

1009
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,050
and it worked just fine, okay.

1010
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,910
- Using it on a ground squirrel

1011
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,010
that walked into your
food hut two weeks ago

1012
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,200
doesn't really count.

1013
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,200
- Oh that's where he got the
spicy curry special last week.

1014
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,630
- That was good.

1015
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,463
- [Raj] Thank you.

1016
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,320
- Is this a flash grenade?

1017
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,540
- It's better than a fly rod.

1018
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,800
- You know what, I don't even
wanna know where you got it.

1019
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,930
Just take it off and leave it here.

1020
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,280
We can't take that with us.

1021
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,557
Is that the pin?

1022
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:29,155
- Oh sh..!

1023
01:02:29,155 --> 01:02:32,025
(explosion)

1024
01:02:32,025 --> 01:02:34,525
(light music)

1025
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,187
(snoring)

1026
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:25,221
(shouting)

1027
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,697
- Sudsy, he was crawling right at me!

1028
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:31,310
- He fell off the chair.

1029
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,720
- I swear I saw him move.

1030
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,830
- As he fell, Andrew.

1031
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,940
- It looked like he was
reaching for me or something.

1032
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,183
- That's what happens when
things fall, they move.

1033
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,177
Have you slept?

1034
01:03:44,177 --> 01:03:46,427
(grunting)

1035
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,121
Well.

1036
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,310
You're getting a little delusional.

1037
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,383
He's back in the chair now.

1038
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,463
If you have another
nightmare, suck your thumb.

1039
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:16,313
(light music)

1040
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,220
- Look.

1041
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,613
- Ah, what?

1042
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:35,696
- An old gun.

1043
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:40,403
Some ammo.

1044
01:04:42,323 --> 01:04:44,603
A newspaper.

1045
01:04:50,407 --> 01:04:51,657
It's from 1914.

1046
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,040
And there's a story on Sudsy

1047
01:04:56,037 --> 01:04:58,750
and his gang conning a group of nuns

1048
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:03,187
out of their rosary beads
and their sacramental wine.

1049
01:05:03,187 --> 01:05:05,030
And there's a picture.

1050
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:05,863
- Neat.

1051
01:05:09,183 --> 01:05:10,016
Huh.

1052
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,393
Hey.

1053
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,553
SS.

1054
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,620
- Do you think it was Sudsy
and his gang's hideout.

1055
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,661
He was just there.

1056
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:23,951
He was trying to reach for his gun, right?

1057
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:24,784
- No, not right!

1058
01:05:24,784 --> 01:05:25,617
- He was trying to reach his gun.

1059
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:28,020
That's what he was
doing, do you understand?

1060
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,720
- Wrong, he's dead.

1061
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,770
I've told you before.

1062
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,800
Cowboy crypt keeper there ain't moving.

1063
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,192
The dead don't crawl.

1064
01:05:38,192 --> 01:05:39,720
The dead don't jump.

1065
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,830
The dead sit there and be dead.

1066
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:43,663
- He jumped out.

1067
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:45,333
- He didn't jump, he fell.

1068
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,670
Additionally, we don't know
where this cabin came from.

1069
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,000
We can't say this is Sudsy's cabin

1070
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,296
or his gang's cabin, or
this is even his stuff.

1071
01:05:55,296 --> 01:05:57,060
It could just be some weird fan boy's

1072
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,070
make believe playhouse.

1073
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:00,580
You've seen the town.

1074
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,560
You need a little bit more than an old gun

1075
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,270
and some bullets in a cabin in Alaska

1076
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,493
to prove to me that this is Sudsy's cabin.

1077
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,460
- How about these rosary beads?

1078
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,560
(dramatic music)

1079
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,493
- We all seem to be recovering just fine.

1080
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,860
Aside from Wally who was kind enough

1081
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,480
to take the brunt of the blast.

1082
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,980
He'll be sitting this one out.

1083
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:36,201
Yeah, let's hit the road.

1084
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,295
- What'd you say?

1085
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:38,930
- [Snake Eyes] You're all right, Wally!

1086
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,043
Walk it off!

1087
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:44,953
- [Raj] This is going
to be a very long day.

1088
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:48,891
(funky music)

1089
01:06:52,326 --> 01:06:54,553
- Well, one lock, one key right?

1090
01:07:02,991 --> 01:07:05,324
(chuckling)

1091
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:10,373
Looks like Sudsy was one of
the original preppers here.

1092
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:13,043
There we go.

1093
01:07:13,043 --> 01:07:14,480
Here, get the bag.

1094
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,403
There we go.

1095
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:22,360
- Looks like we have some
100 year old clam pudding.

1096
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,713
- Oh, neat.

1097
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,563
Huh?

1098
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,193
- Cool.

1099
01:07:35,473 --> 01:07:37,973
(funky music)

1100
01:07:54,175 --> 01:07:57,175
- So do you know where you're going?

1101
01:07:58,388 --> 01:08:01,500
- Eh, I like to put myself
in place of the undead.

1102
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,080
100 year old zombie.

1103
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,260
Fresh from the ground.

1104
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,940
Really get into his mind.

1105
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,370
And then I follow his fingers.

1106
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:10,203
- What?

1107
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:12,143
- His fingers.

1108
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:14,740
I found these a few miles back

1109
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:17,039
at the beginning of the trail.

1110
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,723
And look, there's another one.

1111
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,140
- You are good at finding things.

1112
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:25,973
- It's a gift.

1113
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,596
- Check it out, fingers.

1114
01:08:30,596 --> 01:08:31,929
- Ugh, too soon.

1115
01:08:40,455 --> 01:08:41,471
- What are you doing?

1116
01:08:41,471 --> 01:08:42,450
- What's it look like I'm doing?

1117
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,593
That thing didn't fit.

1118
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,063
I mean, there's some nice stuff in here.

1119
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,393
Shame for it to go to waste.

1120
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,060
Might as well put it on.

1121
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:53,893
- You uh?

1122
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,890
Here, let's see what else.

1123
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,483
Well, put that on.

1124
01:09:13,589 --> 01:09:16,089
(light music)

1125
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:21,213
Get this stuff bagged up.

1126
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:35,643
Hey, think this used to be jerky?

1127
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:45,515
- It's a little dry.

1128
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:48,931
(light music)

1129
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:00,953
- What's up, man?

1130
01:10:00,953 --> 01:10:02,010
Why'd you stop?

1131
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,270
- Hey man, I'm peeing.

1132
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,633
- Oh, ah yeah!

1133
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:08,552
- The show's over.

1134
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,193
- Yeah, yeah.

1135
01:10:12,117 --> 01:10:12,950
Let's go!

1136
01:10:17,642 --> 01:10:20,392
(dramatic music)

1137
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:31,750
- I don't feel good.

1138
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,583
- Well, you shouldn't have eaten

1139
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:35,143
that 100 year old beef jerky.

1140
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:36,150
- Ugh.

1141
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,830
- Where'd we put that paper and pen?

1142
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:39,993
I'm gonna write a ransom note.

1143
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:42,143
- It's on the window sill.

1144
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:55,460
- Hey Burt, wouldn't have been easier

1145
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,350
and save more time if we just left

1146
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,640
the ransom note at the scene

1147
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,210
when we first took Sudsy?

1148
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,443
- Shut up, Andrew!

1149
01:11:02,443 --> 01:11:05,120
This is my first kidnapping, all right.

1150
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,870
I didn't have all the pieces previously

1151
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:10,090
as we do now, all right?

1152
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:10,923
- Right.

1153
01:11:10,923 --> 01:11:13,860
- Don't you worry about the thinking game.

1154
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,693
- Right.

1155
01:11:14,693 --> 01:11:15,550
- I've got it all.

1156
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,340
It's also more dramatic this way.

1157
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,447
- Right, right.

1158
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,653
- He's rocking, you see that right?

1159
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,020
- Yeah, I see it.

1160
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:45,100
All right look, there's five
of us and only one of him.

1161
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,370
- Yeah, but he's undead.

1162
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,000
- I need you all to follow my lead

1163
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,883
and just don't do anything stupid.

1164
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,243
Sudsy!

1165
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,920
Come out with your hands up.

1166
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,343
We have you surrounded.

1167
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,330
- Get down, get down!

1168
01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:08,953
Get Sudsy and get down!

1169
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:10,120
Get down here.

1170
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:12,520
- Did you see that?

1171
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,483
Sudsy just jumped outta the chair.

1172
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,700
- Go! ah!

1173
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,156
- He's kicking out the windows!

1174
01:12:21,156 --> 01:12:23,590
- Hey, get out!

1175
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,781
Take this!

1176
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:27,698
(Andrew screaming)

1177
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:32,540
- Get down!

1178
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:36,399
(gunshot)

1179
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:37,232
Open fire!

1180
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:38,065
- Get him!

1181
01:12:38,065 --> 01:12:40,565
(guns firing)

1182
01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:06,419
- Come out and fight like a man you jerk!

1183
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:07,809
(spraying)

1184
01:13:07,809 --> 01:13:09,258
- Ah god!

1185
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:11,341
Not helping, not helping!

1186
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:14,789
(guns firing)

1187
01:13:25,804 --> 01:13:27,686
- One of us is gonna make it!

1188
01:13:27,686 --> 01:13:30,186
(guns firing)

1189
01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:40,857
- They're coming from over here.

1190
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:43,263
(guns firing)

1191
01:13:43,263 --> 01:13:45,099
- Every man for himself.

1192
01:13:45,099 --> 01:13:48,161
- Hey you, get back, chicken!

1193
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:50,911
(dramatic music)

1194
01:13:58,465 --> 01:13:59,719
- It's not working.

1195
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:00,974
It's not working!

1196
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:01,807
- Give it back!

1197
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:03,887
- It's not working.

1198
01:14:03,887 --> 01:14:06,387
(guns firing)

1199
01:14:08,259 --> 01:14:10,773
- Why did he have to use a revolver?

1200
01:14:10,773 --> 01:14:13,273
(guns firing)

1201
01:14:18,926 --> 01:14:20,426
- Whoa, that's it!

1202
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:22,792
You're up.

1203
01:14:23,683 --> 01:14:24,516
- Oh jeez.

1204
01:14:25,546 --> 01:14:27,499
- Oh wait, oh crap I'm out.

1205
01:14:27,499 --> 01:14:28,749
- Yeah me, too.

1206
01:14:32,925 --> 01:14:34,780
(gun shot)

1207
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,650
- Oh hey, guys.

1208
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,483
- Sissy.

1209
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,827
- Well what do we do now?

1210
01:14:42,991 --> 01:14:45,658
(ominous music)

1211
01:14:52,056 --> 01:14:52,889
- Shut up.

1212
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:56,930
Stay down.

1213
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:01,703
(dramatic music)

1214
01:15:01,703 --> 01:15:03,370
- Did you see Sudsy?

1215
01:15:04,971 --> 01:15:07,721
(dramatic music)

1216
01:15:14,799 --> 01:15:17,216
(gun firing)

1217
01:15:19,195 --> 01:15:20,095
(can hissing)

1218
01:15:21,153 --> 01:15:22,695
(explosion)

1219
01:15:22,695 --> 01:15:26,553
(screaming and coughing)

1220
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,975
(thud)

1221
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:41,865
(coughing)

1222
01:15:47,249 --> 01:15:48,582
- There's smoke.

1223
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:50,748
There's smoke.

1224
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:58,783
Come look.

1225
01:16:01,108 --> 01:16:02,093
You think he's dead?

1226
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,213
- Head down the trail
I'll meet you in a minute.

1227
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:12,273
(ominous music)

1228
01:16:27,658 --> 01:16:28,491
Upgrade.

1229
01:16:33,204 --> 01:16:34,865
(cracking thunder)

1230
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:38,032
- [Donka Voiceover] Bullets fly, guns.

1231
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:41,842
The law man.

1232
01:16:41,842 --> 01:16:45,159
The law man falls lifeless to the ground.

1233
01:16:45,159 --> 01:16:46,050
His chest is still.

1234
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:47,140
- Sherman?

1235
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,273
Sherman wake up.

1236
01:16:50,715 --> 01:16:51,548
Sherman!

1237
01:16:52,536 --> 01:16:54,703
(gasping)

1238
01:17:00,134 --> 01:17:01,740
- Kate, what are you doing here?

1239
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,170
- All of your friends
from your little play date

1240
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:06,370
came back running into town screaming

1241
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:07,980
about Sudsy ambushing them

1242
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,700
and taking you hostage.

1243
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,810
So I formed a little search party

1244
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,593
of my own to come and rescue
the damsel in distress.

1245
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:17,740
- Search party?

1246
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,960
- Well, yeah evidently word

1247
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,083
has gotten around that my
parties stink so, I'm it.

1248
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:26,724
(light music)

1249
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:34,250
Plus, with a bunch of men
screaming like little girls

1250
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,500
and smelling like they soiled themselves,

1251
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,140
not too many people were too excited

1252
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,070
to join in on the rescue.

1253
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,390
- I didn't need rescue, I was doing fine.

1254
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:44,390
- Oh, yeah I'm sure that taking

1255
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:46,270
a nap in the dirt and
bleeding from your head

1256
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,973
was all part of your grand
plan to capture Sudsy.

1257
01:17:50,328 --> 01:17:52,828
(light music)

1258
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,680
- My gun, so you see my gun?

1259
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,383
- No, actually I don't.

1260
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,940
- After my head got hit, I
remember seeing Sudsy run

1261
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,123
off into the woods.

1262
01:18:07,037 --> 01:18:08,622
Did he take my gun?

1263
01:18:08,622 --> 01:18:09,620
- We can get you another gun in town

1264
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,670
but first we've gotta get you outta here.

1265
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:15,659
(light music)

1266
01:18:25,644 --> 01:18:28,394
(dramatic music)

1267
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,640
- Burt, did you notice something odd

1268
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,940
just before the shooting
started at the cabin?

1269
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:12,762
- What?

1270
01:19:12,762 --> 01:19:14,112
- They yelled Sudsy's name.

1271
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,920
Like they were talking to him.

1272
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,793
- [Burt] Yeah, I guess
they did, didn't they?

1273
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:22,220
- [Andrew] Why would they do that?

1274
01:19:23,944 --> 01:19:25,260
- I don't know.

1275
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,409
- Maybe they think Sudsy's alive.

1276
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:28,383
- Well, that's stupid.

1277
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,993
Unless.

1278
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:44,890
When we took Sudsy, nobody saw us, right?

1279
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:51,600
But they saw Sudsy, we
know they saw Sudsy.

1280
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,430
- Okay, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

1281
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,270
- That's weird, that would be weird.

1282
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,390
- Yeah, I caught him
crawling at me this morning.

1283
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:00,200
- No, no, and at the cabin they had

1284
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,380
to have seen him through the window.

1285
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,333
- I swear he keeps staring at me.

1286
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,238
- What?

1287
01:20:07,238 --> 01:20:08,513
- I think Sudsy's alive!

1288
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,487
Not alive per se, but not all dead.

1289
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,358
(light music)

1290
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,700
- We've been over this.

1291
01:20:37,993 --> 01:20:38,913
He's dead.

1292
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,450
- Right.

1293
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:42,283
- Listen!

1294
01:20:43,144 --> 01:20:47,103
I need you to get all
your duke in a duffel.

1295
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,890
I know exactly how we're
gonna finish this ransom note.

1296
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,890
I need you to stay here with Sudsy.

1297
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,172
He is our only ticket outta here.

1298
01:21:05,172 --> 01:21:07,839
(ominous music)

1299
01:21:32,469 --> 01:21:35,136
(running water)

1300
01:21:45,925 --> 01:21:48,675
(clanging metal)

1301
01:21:50,737 --> 01:21:54,070
(moving shower curtain)

1302
01:22:01,641 --> 01:22:04,391
(dramatic music)

1303
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:08,143
- Did you hear that, Higgins?

1304
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:11,913
It sounded like it came from outside.

1305
01:22:12,937 --> 01:22:15,687
(dramatic music)

1306
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:26,557
(chirping birds)

1307
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,493
Hello?

1308
01:22:42,985 --> 01:22:45,735
(clanging metal)

1309
01:22:47,984 --> 01:22:50,651
(ominous music)

1310
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,703
- Okay, Andy.

1311
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:11,383
Keep it together.

1312
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:13,963
Burt will be back.

1313
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,280
Burt will be back.

1314
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,327
(ominous music)

1315
01:24:04,466 --> 01:24:06,799
(chuckling)

1316
01:24:08,101 --> 01:24:09,768
Might come in handy.

1317
01:24:10,915 --> 01:24:13,582
(ominous music)

1318
01:25:02,419 --> 01:25:03,836
It's better than nothing.

1319
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:07,287
- [Sudsy] Hey.

1320
01:25:07,287 --> 01:25:09,954
(ominous music)

1321
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:17,570
Hey.

1322
01:25:20,528 --> 01:25:22,501
Wanna spoon?

1323
01:25:22,501 --> 01:25:23,334
(Andy Screaming)

1324
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:36,759
(Sudsy cackling)

1325
01:25:38,695 --> 01:25:41,445
(Andy screaming)

1326
01:25:44,738 --> 01:25:45,571
- Oh god!

1327
01:25:49,528 --> 01:25:52,064
Find your happy place,
find your happy place.

1328
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:55,185
(whimpering)

1329
01:25:55,185 --> 01:25:57,018
Find your happy place!

1330
01:26:00,033 --> 01:26:01,866
Find your happy place!

1331
01:26:02,716 --> 01:26:04,549
Find your happy place!

1332
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,333
Find your happy place!

1333
01:26:08,856 --> 01:26:11,189
(screaming)

1334
01:26:15,445 --> 01:26:18,180
(light music)

1335
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,433
- Hm, hepatitis again, Gladys.

1336
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:24,503
- Sherman!

1337
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,030
Sherman are you up?

1338
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:28,130
- The door's unlocked.

1339
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,753
- Sherman!

1340
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:31,760
- I'll be fine.

1341
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,650
A bump on the head isn't
gonna kill me in my sleep.

1342
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:34,830
- The Mayor was attacked.

1343
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:35,663
- By who?

1344
01:26:35,663 --> 01:26:36,723
- Sudsy, apparently.

1345
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:39,260
- I'll grab my coat.

1346
01:26:40,457 --> 01:26:43,207
(dramatic music)

1347
01:26:46,961 --> 01:26:49,103
- Andy, it's done!

1348
01:26:50,764 --> 01:26:55,764
Andy!

1349
01:26:56,718 --> 01:26:57,551
Andy!

1350
01:26:59,332 --> 01:27:00,165
Sudsy?

1351
01:27:05,173 --> 01:27:06,403
Where's the mine cart?

1352
01:27:20,877 --> 01:27:23,044
(sighing)

1353
01:27:24,914 --> 01:27:26,530
Andy!

1354
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,787
Quit fooling around!

1355
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:35,113
Is Sudsy okay?

1356
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:44,570
So you mean, while I was gone, Sudsy

1357
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:48,983
offers you a spoon?

1358
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,960
- Yeah, but the way he said
it made me feel kind of dirty.

1359
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:00,750
- And then, he proceeds to
chase you with the mine cart

1360
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,400
and knock you off a cliff?

1361
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,779
- Yes.

1362
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:08,481
- You know it's occurring to me

1363
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:11,210
that you have become a
bit more of a liability

1364
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,870
than you are an asset.

1365
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,880
I've got half a mind
to just leave you here.

1366
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,010
- We could always go back.

1367
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:16,940
- Go back where?

1368
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:17,850
- To Moose Hump.

1369
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:18,683
- To prison?

1370
01:28:18,683 --> 01:28:21,508
- Yeah, it's Gravy Wednesday
there, it'll be great!.

1371
01:28:21,508 --> 01:28:23,990
- The plan is simple.

1372
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:26,650
We sneak into town, we make the drop.

1373
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:28,820
If we do this right nobody even knows

1374
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:29,890
we were here.

1375
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:32,400
And then we take that money

1376
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,300
and fly to Canada.

1377
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,570
You could have gravy for days.

1378
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:39,650
They put it on french
fries and call it poutine.

1379
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,823
- I can't take much more of this, Burt.

1380
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:46,550
- If you want me to leave you alone

1381
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:50,170
and not haunt you for eternity
leave 50,000 dollars cash

1382
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:53,360
at the old gold mill this evening.

1383
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,193
Come alone.

1384
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,890
So you're saying that when you opened

1385
01:28:56,890 --> 01:29:00,390
the door Sudsy whacked you
in the face with a shovel,

1386
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:03,350
dropped this note, and then just ran away?

1387
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:05,270
- Not necessarily.

1388
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:07,460
I found the note stapled to his forehead

1389
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,960
when I came to bring him
his usual morning order

1390
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,210
of Caribou Curry.

1391
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,450
- I told you he was
good at finding things.

1392
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:16,100
- You were laying in the doorway
with your robe wide open.

1393
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,510
Naked as a jay bird.

1394
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:21,800
- Any who, where are we
going to find 50,000 dollars.

1395
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,630
Plus we need him for the tourists.

1396
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,660
He can't just quit and leave.

1397
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,560
- [Raj] It is customary to
give at least two weeks notice.

1398
01:29:31,259 --> 01:29:32,653
- I have a plan.

1399
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,120
- Should we gather the posse?

1400
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,790
- Yeah, sure, let's gather the posse.

1401
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:40,649
The same posse that just left me for dead.

1402
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:43,490
- Oh yeah, good times, right.

1403
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:44,490
- Not funny.

1404
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,214
(light music)

1405
01:30:12,233 --> 01:30:14,893
- I see the drop zone, but no Sudsy.

1406
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:19,196
- Hello!

1407
01:30:19,196 --> 01:30:21,720
(shouting)

1408
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,274
- Where's the cash?

1409
01:30:23,274 --> 01:30:24,880
- Oh, I have it here.

1410
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,910
We're a little light on actual cash

1411
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,837
but we did make it up
with some other things.

1412
01:30:28,837 --> 01:30:30,140
- What's that smell?

1413
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:32,610
- Oh, those are Raj's fresh curry rolls.

1414
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:33,890
We were light on the ransom.

1415
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,317
So he threw them in.

1416
01:30:35,317 --> 01:30:36,772
They're as good as cash.

1417
01:30:36,772 --> 01:30:38,280
- How come he didn't bring 'em himself?

1418
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,270
- Oh he's sitting this one out.

1419
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:43,523
Something about pet
sitting a neighbors ferret.

1420
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:46,310
- How much cash is in here, exactly?

1421
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:49,960
- 137 dollars and 47 cents.

1422
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,890
- Are these coupons?

1423
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:51,880
- Those would be Digger's.

1424
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,820
He's what you might call
an extreme couponer.

1425
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:56,820
- That represents a lot of savings there.

1426
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,420
- Whatever, we're just gonna
have to make this work.

1427
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,670
Mayor, take this.

1428
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,640
Go around and leave it by that sign.

1429
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,310
We'll keep an eye out for
Sudsy and if he appears

1430
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:07,560
then we'll make our move.

1431
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:10,660
- You two, go around
that side of the rock.

1432
01:31:12,237 --> 01:31:14,737
(light music)

1433
01:31:23,457 --> 01:31:25,580
- Do you see anything?

1434
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:28,093
- If I saw something,
I would say something.

1435
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,703
- Right, right.

1436
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:38,930
- Hey, Mayor's coming

1437
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,670
and he's got the bag.

1438
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,870
- Finally.

1439
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:43,793
- So far so good.

1440
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,580
Well, why don't you go
ahead and move around back.

1441
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,530
Make sure nobody's sneaking up behind us.

1442
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:52,383
Keep watch.

1443
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:59,010
Hey, it is very important
they think he's alive.

1444
01:32:02,656 --> 01:32:05,489
(dramatic music)

1445
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,193
- Come on, Mayor walk back to us.

1446
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:15,763
What's he doing?

1447
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:16,790
Why is he just standing there?

1448
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:18,130
- Is he not supposed to?

1449
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:19,900
- No, he's supposed to drop the bag

1450
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,620
so Sudsy can come get it.

1451
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,870
Well that would have been a good detail

1452
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:26,570
to know before we sent him
out there, don't you think?

1453
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:30,261
(dramatic music)

1454
01:32:42,537 --> 01:32:45,204
- Why is he just standing there?

1455
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:54,431
- No, don't look at us!

1456
01:32:54,431 --> 01:32:55,783
Don't look at us!

1457
01:32:55,783 --> 01:32:56,616
Look away.

1458
01:32:59,461 --> 01:33:01,378
No, stop, stop looking.

1459
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,950
Stop it, stop looking.

1460
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:06,200
- [Digger] Do you want me to shoot him?

1461
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,400
- What is he looking at?

1462
01:33:10,728 --> 01:33:12,030
Do you see anybody?

1463
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:13,260
- [Andy] I see nothing.

1464
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,480
- Do you see anything?

1465
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,930
- I don't see anything, Burt.

1466
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:21,043
- Let me see if I can
move this idiot along.

1467
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:27,930
(crashing)

1468
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:28,763
- It's Sudsy.

1469
01:33:28,763 --> 01:33:29,596
What the?

1470
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,610
(screaming)

1471
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:36,810
- Leave the money and walk away.

1472
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,330
You don't know the things I've seen.

1473
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:42,201
- Something's not right.

1474
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:43,450
Dang it, I don't have my gun.

1475
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:44,283
Anybody have an extra?

1476
01:33:44,283 --> 01:33:46,730
- Here, you can use mine.

1477
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:48,341
Laser sight.

1478
01:33:48,341 --> 01:33:51,080
(buzzing)

1479
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:55,100
- Oh here, let me just turn
that down a little bit.

1480
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,330
Sorry about that.

1481
01:33:57,865 --> 01:33:59,403
- Okay, cover me.

1482
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,640
- With what?

1483
01:34:04,603 --> 01:34:07,823
Give me your gun or I'm
punching you in the throat.

1484
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,620
- [Burt] You don't know where I've been!

1485
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:15,890
I'm coming after you!

1486
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:17,640
- [Mayor] Wake me up!
- Burt!

1487
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:18,473
- [Burt] Go!

1488
01:34:18,473 --> 01:34:19,306
- [Mayor] Wake me up!
- Burt!

1489
01:34:19,306 --> 01:34:21,480
- Shoo, I'm gonna give
you to the count of 10.

1490
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,503
- Burt, they're coming inside.

1491
01:34:23,503 --> 01:34:24,850
- [Mayor] Help, what are you.

1492
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:29,150
- [Burt] To get your lying,
yellow, no good keister

1493
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:30,850
of my property!

1494
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:33,282
Before I pump your guts full of lead!

1495
01:34:33,282 --> 01:34:34,430
(mayor wailing)

1496
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,800
One.

1497
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,760
- [Mayor] There's a woman over there.

1498
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,198
How long has it been
since you've had a woman?

1499
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:40,432
Get her, leave me.

1500
01:34:40,432 --> 01:34:42,021
- [Burt] Two!

1501
01:34:42,021 --> 01:34:43,604
- Oh god, somebody!

1502
01:34:44,851 --> 01:34:45,768
Wake me up!

1503
01:34:46,692 --> 01:34:47,558
- 10!

1504
01:34:47,558 --> 01:34:48,950
(clanging metal)

1505
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:49,865
(gunshot)

1506
01:34:49,865 --> 01:34:51,118
- [Mayor] What is going on!

1507
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:52,154
- What the?

1508
01:34:52,154 --> 01:34:53,028
- Shoot him!

1509
01:34:53,028 --> 01:34:54,037
- What?

1510
01:34:54,037 --> 01:34:56,537
(guns firing)

1511
01:34:58,341 --> 01:34:59,971
What the?

1512
01:34:59,971 --> 01:35:02,471
(guns firing)

1513
01:35:13,936 --> 01:35:14,769
Andy!

1514
01:35:19,173 --> 01:35:20,332
We gotta go!

1515
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:21,965
- Stop!

1516
01:35:21,965 --> 01:35:24,465
(guns firing)

1517
01:35:27,097 --> 01:35:28,746
Stop that fire!

1518
01:35:28,746 --> 01:35:29,996
Hold your fire!

1519
01:35:45,711 --> 01:35:46,544
- Look.

1520
01:35:48,183 --> 01:35:49,600
- [Burt] Perfect.

1521
01:35:50,982 --> 01:35:53,482
(light music)

1522
01:36:26,045 --> 01:36:27,212
- Cease fire.

1523
01:36:29,438 --> 01:36:32,297
(gunshot)

1524
01:36:32,297 --> 01:36:33,130
Digger!

1525
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:35,579
- Sorry, my bad.

1526
01:36:39,489 --> 01:36:42,239
(revving engine)

1527
01:36:53,145 --> 01:36:54,110
- Well that didn't go well.

1528
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:56,023
- I know, I was there.

1529
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,080
It's time we show these
bumpkins who's in charge.

1530
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,243
Who's boss.

1531
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:06,160
We are, we're in charge.

1532
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,023
- Right, right.

1533
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,033
- And where's Sudsy?

1534
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:16,573
- What do you mean he's right.

1535
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:22,436
(sighing)

1536
01:37:24,336 --> 01:37:27,169
(dramatic music)

1537
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:37,163
- Now, I'm pretty sure
one of those guys saw us.

1538
01:37:38,117 --> 01:37:39,717
So if we're gonna get outta here

1539
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,990
we gotta make it quick.

1540
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:47,304
Would you get over here
and hold something?

1541
01:37:47,304 --> 01:37:48,137
- Uh-uh.

1542
01:37:48,137 --> 01:37:48,970
What's the new plan?

1543
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:52,610
- I can't believe that Sudsy felt

1544
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,860
he had to steal my four wheeler.

1545
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,500
- Did you get a good look at him?

1546
01:37:56,500 --> 01:38:00,580
- Not really, but I do
remember seeing two Sudsy's.

1547
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,413
- Excuse me?

1548
01:38:01,413 --> 01:38:02,246
- Well it's probably just

1549
01:38:02,246 --> 01:38:04,350
the blow to your head
had you seeing double.

1550
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:05,770
- I understand that I've been getting hit

1551
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:08,790
in the head a lot, but I swear I saw more

1552
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:10,880
than one person on that four wheeler.

1553
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,700
Now, I think it's possible

1554
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:16,258
that Sudsy's got some outside help.

1555
01:38:16,258 --> 01:38:18,150
- The Dirty Bunch.

1556
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:20,233
Sudsy must have dug up his old gang.

1557
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:22,500
- The Dirty Bunch?

1558
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,400
- Two of them died with
him in the shootout.

1559
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,750
- Now we're dealing with more zombies.

1560
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,480
- Sudsy's not a zombie.

1561
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,590
- Oh yeah, well if he's not a zombie

1562
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:32,160
than how come he's been running around

1563
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,064
and knocking you out right and left?

1564
01:38:34,064 --> 01:38:35,300
- All right, all right, all right.

1565
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,430
Now, Agent Sherman, I'm not saying

1566
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:38,870
that I'm completely convinced

1567
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:41,420
but let's say that you are correct

1568
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:44,210
and there's more here going
on than we originally thought.

1569
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,523
What's our next move?

1570
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,210
- Well, I guess we could wait for them

1571
01:38:50,210 --> 01:38:51,740
to make contact again.

1572
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:53,220
- When's that gonna be?

1573
01:38:54,681 --> 01:38:55,803
(screaming)

1574
01:38:55,803 --> 01:39:00,803
- Oh Digger, are you all right?

1575
01:39:01,610 --> 01:39:03,810
- All right, they got
the package, let's go.

1576
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:06,753
- Wait.

1577
01:39:06,753 --> 01:39:08,245
- What?

1578
01:39:08,245 --> 01:39:09,563
- Do you mean this package?

1579
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:12,430
- I thought you taped that to the?

1580
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:14,494
Give me that!

1581
01:39:14,494 --> 01:39:15,644
I'll just do it myself.

1582
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,130
- It's just a rock with a note on it.

1583
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:20,463
- What does the note say?

1584
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:27,650
- If you want Sudsy back have the money

1585
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:30,950
in an airplane with a pilot
for us by noon tomorrow.

1586
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:34,000
If you don't comply you'll
never see Sudsy again.

1587
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,380
To show we're serious we are
including this little gift.

1588
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:39,760
- So Sudsy really does have help.

1589
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,093
- What's the gift, the rock?

1590
01:39:45,876 --> 01:39:47,805
(crashing)

1591
01:39:47,805 --> 01:39:49,339
(screaming)

1592
01:39:49,339 --> 01:39:51,041
- [Mayor] Oh for goodness sake!

1593
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:53,970
Can't they aim for the same window pane?

1594
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:55,370
- Got it.

1595
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:56,970
Let's go, grab that bag of meat.

1596
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,373
- I forgot the attachment
on the first rock.

1597
01:40:05,348 --> 01:40:08,015
(ominous music)

1598
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,233
- What the?

1599
01:40:18,634 --> 01:40:20,633
- Is that a thumb?

1600
01:40:20,633 --> 01:40:23,063
- I don't see any finger nail.

1601
01:40:24,370 --> 01:40:25,203
- Huh.

1602
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:30,293
I wouldn't have thought
that Sudsy was Jewish.

1603
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,690
- Oh!

1604
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:35,250
I want to thank you all
for joining me here.

1605
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:38,290
I was running out of windows at my office.

1606
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:39,760
- All right, how are we gonna get

1607
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,350
a plane out here by noon tomorrow?

1608
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:45,820
- Not to mention, we showed up
a little short on the ransom.

1609
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:47,420
Ah, that reminds me, I have to make

1610
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,610
a fresh batch of curry rolls.

1611
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:51,236
- Do you guys realize that is just

1612
01:40:51,236 --> 01:40:53,990
a simple corpse napping, not a zombie.

1613
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,953
- Uh, no.

1614
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:57,520
- We need to get them out in the open.

1615
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,400
No more quick glimpses.

1616
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,300
That way we can figure out
who's finally behind this.

1617
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:04,873
- Okay, how do you suggest
we make that happen?

1618
01:41:06,148 --> 01:41:08,898
(dramatic music)

1619
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:11,333
- We'll get them their plane.

1620
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,240
And I'm gonna need all
of you to make this work.

1621
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,670
- Tell us what you want us to do.

1622
01:41:22,372 --> 01:41:25,122
(ethereal music)

1623
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,970
- Well, the airplane's on the runway.

1624
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:33,893
So far so good.

1625
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,480
- Can you see if the pilot's there?

1626
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,550
- Not from this angle.

1627
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:38,383
- What about the money?

1628
01:41:38,383 --> 01:41:39,390
- It's probably in the plane.

1629
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:41,053
We have to get a closer look.

1630
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:49,450
- The place looks eerily quiet.

1631
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:50,710
Do you see anyone?

1632
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:51,543
- No.

1633
01:41:53,737 --> 01:41:56,510
I don't, whoa, wait a minute.

1634
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:57,343
What the?

1635
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,960
They just left the money
sitting in the middle of town.

1636
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,180
Why didn't they put it next to the plane

1637
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:04,680
like you told 'em in the note?

1638
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:07,003
- Yeah.

1639
01:42:09,064 --> 01:42:10,564
The note.

1640
01:42:10,564 --> 01:42:11,630
- You didn't put that
in the note, did you?

1641
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:13,320
- I was rushed.

1642
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:14,840
- I don't like the looks of this.

1643
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,530
We gotta go to the town to get the money?

1644
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:18,830
- You got that dynamite
you found in the mine?

1645
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:21,833
- Yeah.

1646
01:42:23,587 --> 01:42:24,620
It might be a trap.

1647
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:26,620
- Yeah, but in this case
we have the advantage.

1648
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,453
- How's that?

1649
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:30,510
- We know it's a trap.

1650
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:34,469
(dramatic music)

1651
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:52,850
- Is everybody in position?

1652
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:57,850
- [Snake Eyes] Cyclops
and Dirt Boy in position.

1653
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:59,346
- Who?

1654
01:42:59,346 --> 01:43:00,780
- [Snake Eyes] Snake Eyes and Digger.

1655
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:03,260
I thought you were
supposed to have call signs

1656
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,600
when you're using these things.

1657
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,600
- Kate and Hobart, do you copy?

1658
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,010
- Kate-a-licious and the Hobman copy loud

1659
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:12,833
and clear, Agent Sugarpants.

1660
01:43:13,706 --> 01:43:15,080
(sighing)

1661
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,920
- No more call names, we're done.

1662
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:19,170
Remember, nobody do anything until we know

1663
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:20,050
what we're dealing with.

1664
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:21,750
I don't want anybody getting hurt.

1665
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:25,730
- Thanks for the vest, by the way.

1666
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:27,080
You didn't have to do that.

1667
01:43:28,644 --> 01:43:30,394
- It wasn't really my color anyway.

1668
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:37,463
(buzzing)

1669
01:43:37,463 --> 01:43:39,433
- Ow, man hey it's me.

1670
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:43,120
Ow, oh that's painful.

1671
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,530
- What are you doing in here, anyway?

1672
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:46,300
- Well, I thought it would be safer

1673
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,573
to hang out with the guy with the gun

1674
01:43:47,573 --> 01:43:49,880
and the fancy training, of course.

1675
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:52,810
- All right, just be quiet okay?

1676
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,960
- Although, you are
the one zombies do like

1677
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,900
to hit in the head all the time.

1678
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,890
Perhaps I didn't think this one through.

1679
01:43:58,890 --> 01:44:00,551
I should go.

1680
01:44:00,551 --> 01:44:03,301
(dramatic music)

1681
01:44:09,908 --> 01:44:12,241
(explosion)

1682
01:44:14,266 --> 01:44:17,016
(ethereal music)

1683
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:29,613
- What was that?

1684
01:44:29,613 --> 01:44:30,470
- [Snake Eyes] It looks
like something blew up

1685
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,230
on the far edge of town!

1686
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:34,680
Digger and I are gonna
run over and check it out.

1687
01:44:39,042 --> 01:44:40,435
- Are we good?

1688
01:44:40,435 --> 01:44:41,268
- Yeah.

1689
01:44:41,268 --> 01:44:42,101
- Great.

1690
01:44:43,835 --> 01:44:47,290
(ominous music)

1691
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:48,600
- [Sherman] Do you see anything?

1692
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,540
- [Raj] No.

1693
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:51,140
- Kate, do you see anything?

1694
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:52,490
- No, I don't see anything.

1695
01:45:00,841 --> 01:45:03,091
(coughing)

1696
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,553
- Come on.

1697
01:45:08,512 --> 01:45:11,960
It was an outhouse that exploded.

1698
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,023
- That's unusual, right?

1699
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:19,233
Cyclops and Dirt Boy are
heading back into position.

1700
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:29,980
- It's awfully quiet out there.

1701
01:45:30,828 --> 01:45:32,820
- Yeah, almost too quiet, huh?

1702
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,370
- Maybe our distraction worked.

1703
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:36,780
- All right, everybody sit tight.

1704
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:38,330
Let's see if something happens.

1705
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:43,290
- We're getting that money
and we're going to Canada.

1706
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:44,936
Let's go.

1707
01:45:44,936 --> 01:45:47,686
(dramatic music)

1708
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:52,716
- [Sherman] Okay, something's happening.

1709
01:45:52,716 --> 01:45:53,549
They're coming out.

1710
01:45:53,549 --> 01:45:54,653
Everyone, hold your position.

1711
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:56,623
- I don't like this, Burt.

1712
01:45:56,623 --> 01:45:57,456
- Shut up!

1713
01:45:59,026 --> 01:46:01,776
(dramatic music)

1714
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:05,040
- Kate, your brother's out there.

1715
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,510
- What, where is he?

1716
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,130
- [Sherman] He's coming around
the corner of your building.

1717
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:09,930
He's headed straight to the bad guy.

1718
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:15,817
- Oh, Alex what are you thinking!

1719
01:46:16,689 --> 01:46:19,439
(dramatic music)

1720
01:46:24,933 --> 01:46:25,766
- Get up.

1721
01:46:30,165 --> 01:46:32,916
(chortle)

1722
01:46:32,916 --> 01:46:34,305
- Not good, not good.

1723
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:35,138
- Go, go.

1724
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:38,780
- [Sherman] Hey!

1725
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:39,803
- This guy again.

1726
01:46:41,268 --> 01:46:42,351
- ABCD Agent!

1727
01:46:43,325 --> 01:46:46,075
(dramatic music)

1728
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:27,333
- Wanna spork?

1729
01:47:29,909 --> 01:47:32,242
(screaming and electrical crackling)

1730
01:47:35,289 --> 01:47:38,760
(dramatic music)

1731
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,360
- Why you little son of!

1732
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:41,870
- Hey!

1733
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:42,950
Drop the gun.

1734
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:43,783
- [Hobart] Go.

1735
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:49,523
- Drop the gun!

1736
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:51,363
- No, man.

1737
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,550
You drop your gun.

1738
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:58,760
- They're not zombies.

1739
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:03,760
They're just a couple of
desperate looking men with guns.

1740
01:48:03,790 --> 01:48:04,683
- You good?

1741
01:48:04,683 --> 01:48:05,516
(Electrical crackling)

1742
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:07,833
Pick up Sudsy.

1743
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,193
Hey!

1744
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:14,986
(grunting)

1745
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:19,270
Come one step closer and
I'm blowing his brains out.

1746
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:20,320
- You've gotta be kidding me.

1747
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,363
- I mean it, man.

1748
01:48:23,007 --> 01:48:24,107
Sudsy will be history.

1749
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:27,960
No pun intended.

1750
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,447
- Look, let's just calm down.

1751
01:48:29,447 --> 01:48:30,490
- You calm down!

1752
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:32,160
- Just stay calm.

1753
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:36,870
Let the hostage go and
we can talk about this.

1754
01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:40,160
- I'm getting on that
plane, I'm taking Sudsy

1755
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:41,360
and I'm going to Canada.

1756
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:44,610
You can have him back when I'm done.

1757
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:49,658
(meowing)

1758
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:54,130
- We got you a plane.

1759
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:55,720
Just leave Sudsy and go.

1760
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,990
- I'm not doing anything until I see

1761
01:48:57,990 --> 01:48:59,330
that plane started up.

1762
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:01,630
- Drop the gun and we'll
figure something out.

1763
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:07,843
- Greetings, Wally.

1764
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:10,690
- Hey, how's it going?

1765
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:14,408
(crashing)

1766
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:24,113
- Oh, it seems you've dropped your plane.

1767
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,803
Wait a minute, that's
not a real plane, Wally.

1768
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:35,213
- Oh no!

1769
01:49:38,979 --> 01:49:41,146
(gunshot)

1770
01:49:43,666 --> 01:49:46,416
(ethereal music)

1771
01:50:02,954 --> 01:50:06,621
- [Donka Voiceover] His
breath, not a sound.

1772
01:50:08,573 --> 01:50:10,823
(ricochet)

1773
01:50:12,388 --> 01:50:13,555
- I called it!

1774
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:17,520
(dramatic music)

1775
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:22,155
(gunshots)

1776
01:50:25,412 --> 01:50:26,995
- [Gladys] Ah, run!

1777
01:50:28,279 --> 01:50:31,029
(dramatic music)

1778
01:50:33,522 --> 01:50:35,285
- I ain't going back!

1779
01:50:35,285 --> 01:50:37,785
(guns firing)

1780
01:50:40,618 --> 01:50:42,182
Canada!

1781
01:50:42,182 --> 01:50:44,682
(guns firing)

1782
01:50:48,787 --> 01:50:50,954
(purring)

1783
01:50:52,488 --> 01:50:55,238
(dramatic music)

1784
01:50:59,589 --> 01:51:01,074
(hissing cat)

1785
01:51:01,074 --> 01:51:02,002
- Higgins, no!

1786
01:51:02,002 --> 01:51:03,002
Higgins, oh!

1787
01:51:05,389 --> 01:51:08,139
(dramatic music)

1788
01:51:23,238 --> 01:51:24,377
- [Burt] Canada!

1789
01:51:24,377 --> 01:51:25,544
- Higgins, no!

1790
01:51:26,795 --> 01:51:28,962
(meowing)

1791
01:51:37,509 --> 01:51:38,342
- God, oh!

1792
01:51:39,384 --> 01:51:40,850
(coughing)

1793
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:42,471
It got it in my mouth!

1794
01:51:42,471 --> 01:51:43,590
(spitting)

1795
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:47,373
There's mummy dust in my
stinking eyes, Canada!

1796
01:51:48,463 --> 01:51:50,713
(grunting)

1797
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,073
- Are you okay?

1798
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,393
- Yeah.

1799
01:52:04,446 --> 01:52:06,946
(meowing cat)

1800
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:09,523
- Oh, thanks.

1801
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,290
- Sorry about your cat, Mr. Mayor.

1802
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:16,380
- Oh, I'm sure that after years

1803
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:18,623
of therapy we'll both be fine.

1804
01:52:21,170 --> 01:52:24,690
- Ladies and gentlemen may
I present to you, Sudsy Slim

1805
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:25,963
and his zombie gang.

1806
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:30,163
And also his lost treasure.

1807
01:52:31,436 --> 01:52:33,530
- [Kate] How did that get in there?

1808
01:52:33,530 --> 01:52:36,960
- I think your grandpa
Sudsy didn't trust banks

1809
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,910
and took to keistering his valuables.

1810
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:42,270
- That would explain historical accounts

1811
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:45,490
of how he jangled while he walked

1812
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:47,880
but never wore spurs.

1813
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,120
- Well come, good people.

1814
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:50,320
All is well.

1815
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:53,400
Higgins and our Sudsy
are both returned to us.

1816
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,040
Let us away to the Slippery Nickel

1817
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,090
for some celebration!

1818
01:52:58,502 --> 01:53:01,335
(uplifting music)

1819
01:53:10,365 --> 01:53:11,615
- Look at that.

1820
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:16,280
What?

1821
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,853
Hey, that's an eye for an eye.

1822
01:53:19,057 --> 01:53:22,224
It's in the Bible, you can look it up!

1823
01:53:24,778 --> 01:53:27,611
(triumphal music)

1824
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,780
(funky music)

1825
01:55:31,218 --> 01:55:33,718
(light music)

1826
01:59:18,658 --> 01:59:21,075
(soft music)
