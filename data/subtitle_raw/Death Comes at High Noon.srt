1
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,146
Shit! Damn it.

2
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,527
Hello?

3
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,185
Hello? Anybody here?

4
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,556
Lie still.
You were very lucky.

5
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,950
A concussion and a sprained ankle.
You could have broken your neck.

6
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,081
Are you better now?

7
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,176
Lie still

8
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,581
The police wants a word with you.
If you are ready?

9
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,596
Please lie still. You must lie
still a couple of days -

10
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,124
- and by the way behave
yourself

11
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,042
Alright, Duus Jensen. Please be brief.
He's just awakened.

12
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,635
How do you do. Duus Jensen.
This is my colleague Sgt Hald.

13
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,988
We won't disturb you long.

14
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,733
We found your papers in your clothes.

15
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,518
Peter Sander. The Home Guard
in Copenhagen. Peter Bangsvej 114.

16
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,613
- Is that correct?
- correct.

17
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,035
- On what business did you come here?
- I ran out of gas.

18
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,829
- Then it's your car up on the road?
- KA 32946.

19
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,991
Yes. I went back to
borrow a phone.

20
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,816
- Why exactly up here?
- I saw a light when I went by.

21
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,763
But then Ifell,
and when I got up again -

22
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,966
he shot at me.

23
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,693
- Shot at you?
- Yes.

24
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,914
- Who?
- I don't know?

25
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,666
The killer, I suppose.

26
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,669
- The killer?
- Yes.

27
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,608
- Did you see him?
- No. It was dark.

28
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,837
- Then, how could he see you?
- I suppose he couldn't.

29
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,224
- Then, why did he shoot at you?
- I suppose he could hear me.

30
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,011
- I see. Then what?
- Then I knocked at the door.

31
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,612
When nobody came, Iwent in.
It wasn't locked.

32
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,648
The light was on.
They were all gone.

33
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,625
- Who?
- The guests.

34
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,642
The only thing I found was
the body in the bedroom.

35
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,395
When I <i>came</i> back to the front door
it was locked from inside with a hinge

36
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,869
So I went upstairs
and then the lights went out -

37
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,715
- and then he pushed me
down the stairs.

38
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,698
I see.

39
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,379
Did you catch him yet?

40
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,895
- Who?
- The killer.

41
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,262
You need to take it easy
and get some rest.

42
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,235
We will be back shortly.

43
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,685
- You don't think I did it?
- We don't think anything about anybody.

44
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,950
Dr. Lindberg committed suicide.

45
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,224
- That can't be true.
- It is beyond any doubt.

46
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,520
He was found
with his gun in his hand.

47
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,503
There was no gun.

48
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,355
It has been put there.

49
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,735
He was murdered.

50
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,029
- Why didn't you call us?
- The phone was disconnected.

51
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,865
I see.

52
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,694
We have called several times
this morning.

53
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,706
Listen. Something is wrong.
Someone is trying to fool you.

54
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,645
- Have you talked to any of the guests?
- Dr. Lindberg was alone all night.

55
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,621
His maid was off for the night.

56
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,588
How will you explain
the dinner table?

57
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,441
The dinner table?

58
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,674
Is that gone as well?

59
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,345
It was set for three people. There was
food on the plates and lit candles.

60
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,944
I'm sorry,
but there wasn't any dinner table.

61
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,487
I think we better...
Dr. Lund will only get mad at us.

62
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,966
It's obvious, that you hurt you head.

63
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,294
Just one information.
Your position?

64
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,815
Writer.

65
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,724
- What kind of books do you write?
- Detective novels.

66
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,903
- Good day.
- Good day.

67
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,601
Merete Lindberg.
I hope you slept well.

68
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,511
I did, thank you.

69
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,642
Are you hungry?
You slept most of the day.

70
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,375
Yes, perhaps a little.

71
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,560
Then I will get you some food.

72
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,536
Dr. Lund told me you need rest.
You must stay until you are well.

73
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,546
- Very kind of you.
- I will send miss Joergensen.

74
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,710
- Call me if you need anything.
- Thank you very much.

75
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,814
- Feeling better?
- How do you think I look?

76
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,359
Not bad.
Considering your age.

77
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,873
- Thanks. Better or worse?
- Much better.

78
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,324
Do you have a cigaret'!

79
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,714
- Do you think that's wise?
- I think I could get up.

80
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,563
I would strongly advise you not to.
You are not wearing any clothes.

81
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,515
They were dirty and soaked.

82
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,959
We had to undress you
and wash you clothes.

83
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,540
- Are you family?
- My name is Eva Lindberg.

84
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,722
It was my uncle, Joachim,
you found in the bed room.

85
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,521
I'm sorry.

86
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,866
Merete was married to my older brother,
who died in a plane crash five years ago.

87
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,012
She is alone with her son, John. He is
twelve years old and not an easy boy.

88
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,825
- Do you live close by?
- Arhus. But we have a cabin here.

89
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,282
Merete and John have been living here for a week.
I only came this morning.

90
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,672
I was supposed to come with Bertel,
but I couldn't find him.

91
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,497
Bertel is my little brother. He studies
law. That's it, the whole family.

92
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,506
Poor miss Joergensen. She is the only
one having a hard time.

93
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,570
- You were not particularly close to...?
- We weren't getting along very well.

94
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,046
Merete is probably hurt the most.
She lived by his grace -

95
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,156
- and he thought she was too fussy.
He bullied her.

96
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,998
He was only kind to Bertel.

97
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,555
He thought that boys must be boys.

98
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,076
A girl on the other hand
is not supposed to act like a slut

99
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,412
Like me.

100
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,241
Listen, you aren't eating anything.
I will let you get rid of me.

101
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,543
You can stay if you like.

102
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,644
That's right. You think uncle Joachim
was murdered.

103
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,519
Not only do I believe it...

104
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,644
It's not nice of you to think so.

105
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,635
Only three people have a really good
motive for killing uncle Joachim

106
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:13,525
He was very wealthy. Both Merete, Bertel
and I are in dire need of money.

107
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,521
Are you John?

108
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,540
Did she talk about me?

109
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,540
I know all about you.

110
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,541
You don't have to leave.

111
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,541
Come on in.

112
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,541
<i>Do you want some food?</i>

113
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,617
Why aren't you in school?

114
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,850
I'm on vacation.

115
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,245
- Now. That's a strange time of the year.
- It's only our school.

116
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,167
I see.

117
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,366
And only the best students.

118
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,772
I was the only one in my class
who got off.

119
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,946
That's nice to spend a little
time in the country.

120
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,428
- It's boring.
- okay.

121
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,162
If only uncle Joachim didn't get nailed.

122
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,111
- Nailed?
- Yes.

123
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,075
He committed suicide.

124
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,545
They say you are mad.

125
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,469
' Who?
. Evel'ybouy_

126
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,525
- The cops, mom and the doctor.
- I see.

127
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,540
Because you hurt your head.

128
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,526
I'm the only one in the world,
who don't think you are crazy.

129
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,522
I believe everything you say.

130
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,535
The murder, the shooting and
the phone.

131
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,544
The man pushing you down the
stairs and the dinner table.

132
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,540
How do you know all that?

133
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,540
I was spying outside the door
when the cops were here.

134
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,541
Is it true that you write
detective novels?

135
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,541
Yes.

136
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,541
Like this one?

137
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,541
Maybe not exactly like that one.

138
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,543
Why don't we solve the case?

139
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,543
- We'?
- Yes. You and me.

140
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,541
I don'! know.

141
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,263
It could be fun.

142
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,637
You got up too soon. You were supposed
to stay in bed for a couple of days.

143
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,503
I'm feeling alright. Besides I can't
trouble you by occupying the guest room any longer

144
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,768
- Where are you going?
- I was on my way to Norway.

145
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,024
A skiing trip?
You don't have to do that now.

146
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,669
Concussion and sprained ankle.
Why don't you stay for a couple of days.

147
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,878
- If you insist.
- Oh, I don't.

148
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,326
- It is very beautiful.
- Yes it is...

149
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,630
Besides dr. Lund insists you
take it easy.

150
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,585
- Then we have much better time
- Time, for what?

151
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,921
Solve the murder of course.
He and I made an agreement.

152
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,331
- John, why don't you go out to play?
- Play? why?

153
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,193
- It is cold as hell.
- Then put on some clothes.

154
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,849
- What am I supposed to play?
- Whatever. Just go.

155
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,737
- Can I do whatever I want to?
- yes, yes.

156
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,585
I think he heard something
through the door.

157
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,647
- He is quite a lively boy.
- Do you know the one about the toad and the prince?

158
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,935
I tried kissing John twice,
and he didn't turn.

159
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,577
- Once he even bid me.
- It's not easy.

160
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,443
I thought a change of air maybe...

161
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,674
And you're on holiday

162
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,636
- Holiday?
- Did he tell you that?

163
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,523
He told me it was a price for
being clever at school.

164
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,169
He was kicked out of school
last week.

165
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,842
I see.

166
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,202
I have to get a hold of this. It
takes so long with the hand dryer.

167
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,600
I have to tow my car.

168
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,977
I have some gas to spare. Normally
only girls run dry.

169
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,827
I need to get some clothes on
then I will take you.

170
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,134
Miss Joergensen?

171
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,747
Just wanted to thank you for the clothes.
It's as good as new.

172
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,522
You're welcome.

173
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,149
I was thinking about something,
miss Joergensen.

174
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,022
You were off duty monday night.
The night the doctor...

175
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,945
When you came next morning, did you
notice anything particular in the kitchen?

176
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,078
Yes, something odd about the kitchen.

177
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,609
What?

178
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,556
Everything was just odd that morning.

179
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,134
But there was something in particular.

180
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,779
H <i>ow?</i>

181
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,045
The doctor': coffee cup.

182
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,574
Yes?

183
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,929
I had already done the dishes.

184
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,173
Just before I left
I put the cup on the kitchen table.

185
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,095
The next morning it was clean.

186
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,377
But the doctor never washes his cup.

187
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,544
And none of the ladies had been
in the kitchen.

188
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,466
It was all very odd.

189
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,452
How long have you been with the doctor?

190
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,895
Eight years.

191
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,012
- But you didn't live here?
- No.

192
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,629
People would've talked.
They are so busy talking.

193
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,723
The lady asked me to move in now.

194
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,263
Why don't you move in the guest room then?
I might as well...

195
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,225
This is fine for me.

196
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,201
I don't mind.

197
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,136
John!

198
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,426
John!

199
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,798
John!

200
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,618
- John, where are you?
- Here.

201
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,413
Oh God, I thought...

202
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,402
- What are you doing?
- I'm playing.

203
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,262
- How can you do something like this?
- I could play whatever I wanted, remember.

204
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,785
But you can't...
We have to try to put this out.

205
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,679
- Not much to do I'm afraid.
- It's full of papers and paper boxes.

206
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,505
It's almost burned to the ground.

207
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,522
It's horrible. What <i>am</i> I to do
with this boy?

208
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,744
I can take him for a trip.
I'm going anyway for some gas.

209
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,068
- Would you really?
- yes, yes.

210
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,519
That's awfully nice of you.

211
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,149
Well, I have to get finished with
this hair.

212
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,974
Thank you.

213
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,999
- What did you find?
- Five.

214
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,464
Down in the pocket.

215
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,568
Are you not mad at me at all?

216
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,772
It wasn't my shed.

217
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,250
It wasn't my damn shed either.

218
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,625
Come on.

219
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,448
Nice car you have.
Fancy!

220
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,811
- I thought you were still angry from this morning.
- I am.

221
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,746
You can't keep a secret.

222
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,585
I'm sorry. Are we not going to
solve the case then?

223
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,155
- Maybe.
- I won't tell anybody.

224
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,590
Even if they stick me with needles
or pull off my nails.

225
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,353
Thank you. That will do.

226
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,215
How are we going to start?

227
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,645
First we have to find out
who's got a motive.

228
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,381
And then we need to find out
if they got an alibi.

229
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,305
What they did monday night,
when the doctor was killed.

230
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,151
What did you do monday night?

231
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,164
- Are you saying it could be me?
- Of course. Why not?

232
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,692
Can'! you take a little excitement.

233
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,278
Give me the knife. That's not
something for small boys.

234
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,578
Nonsense. You said it yourself,
it could be me.

235
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,669
- It can't.
- Why not?

236
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,431
Because the killer didn'tjust
murder the doctor.

237
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,862
He also cleaned the table and
washed the dishes.

238
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,353
He even washed one cup too many.

239
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,702
- You see, it can't be you then.
- No.

240
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,165
- I was in the cabin sleeping, anyway.
- Yes, of course. What else?

241
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,444
Well, I wasn't quite sleeping. I was reading.
I pretended I was sleeping when mother looked in -

242
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,189
when she left I kept on reading.

243
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,869
- Wasn't your mother at home?
- No she came back and looked in my room.

244
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,757
But then she left again.

245
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,608
- When did she come back?
- I don't know. Guess I fell asleep.

246
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,090
But it was late.

247
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,943
I see.

248
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,014
I need to say hello.
You can take care of the car.

249
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,045
Somebody must have washed that cup.

250
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,457
I'm having a hard time realizing
what's so unusual.

251
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:53,190
Ifjust someone was being busy
he could have missed...

252
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,081
That's true. That suspicious story.
Are you perhaps a detective?

253
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,346
I am curious to find out how
crazy I was.

254
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,420
But if I find out anything
I will let you know.

255
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,374
I have to advise you not
to do anything.

256
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,668
We will take care of this.

257
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,103
You are only unnecessarily
complicating things.

258
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,626
Well.

259
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,467
But don't you find it peculiar
about that coffee cup?

260
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,745
It doesn't prove anything,
but of course I will put it in my report.

261
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,062
You must be mad. You are
supposed to be in bed.

262
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,364
- I'm fine.
- Nonsense. You were delirious.

263
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,680
So does the police think.

264
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,187
Of course. Joachim took his own life.

265
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,873
- You don't seem surprised.
- It wasn't a surprise.

266
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,224
He was feeling lonely and
was experiencing depressions.

267
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,238
He even occasionally
talked about saying goodbye.

268
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,646
You were a close friend of
dr. Lindberg?

269
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,462
Perhaps his closest. We were
sometimes having dinner.

270
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,794
What were you doing monday night?

271
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,377
That's none of your business.

272
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,413
Oh, we missed the gas station.

273
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,078
Well, I'll go there tomorrow.

274
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,354
- Can I come?
- Yes, yes.

275
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,715
Great. I also want a sports car.

276
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,832
Might be one like this. How fast
can it go?

277
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,519
Fast enough.

278
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,306
Well, of course it's old.

279
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,985
There was once an accident here.
Right here.

280
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,458
It was a Iumberjack. He came
from within the woods.

281
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,425
He was on a moped,
and he was hit by a car.

282
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,137
The car took off. It was from Alborg,
but they never found it.

283
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,453
It happened last sommer.

284
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,414
A year and a half ago.

285
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,102
He was all crushed. All blood and
mud and brain matter.

286
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,935
- Thanks, that's enough.
- And his moped was all flat.

287
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,319
They've probably let that damn rat out.

288
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,106
- The rat?
- Yes. Those stupid bitches.

289
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,554
Was it a rat you kept in a
box this morning?

290
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,137
Yes, one i caught. I took it
in to feed it.

291
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,446
They just had to meddle.

292
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,742
I even wrote on the box.

293
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,521
"Do not open until Christmas"

294
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,784
- I let it go.
- Hero.

295
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,333
- I grounded him.
- Hopefully for the rest of his life.

296
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,812
- May I borrow your car this afternoon?
- Yes.

297
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,575
Here you are. Where are you going?

298
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,836
I'm going to town. I'll be back
for supper. Thank you, goodbye.

299
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,029
- Let me.
- Thank you.

300
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,698
Tell me, when did you last clean
in here, miss Joergensen?

301
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,679
- What do you mean?
- I mean when did you last vacuum and such?

302
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,876
I cleaned the house this monday
before I left.

303
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,691
You didn't clean anything since
monday night then -

304
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,773
since the doctor...

305
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,135
"Car salesman H. F. Kaergaard"

306
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,257
He is not at home. He was going
to talk to the police.

307
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,860
He took his bike,
<i>so</i> it'll probably be a while

308
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,589
You might run into him at the station
if it's important.

309
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,603
May I borrow your phone?

310
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,521
Be my guest.

311
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,330
- The phone is right there.
- Thank you. Do you have the number to the station?

312
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,033
- There's a phonebook.
- thanks.

313
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,427
- Is it your daughter?
- Daughter in law.

314
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,818
- So your son is the priest?
- That's right.

315
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,312
I see.

316
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,814
Mrs. Kaergaard, where was your
husband monday night?

317
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,062
I don'! know.

318
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,030
- Was he at home?
- Yes, he was.

319
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,727
Yes, hello?

320
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,113
Yes, hello.
How is your head?

321
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,996
Well, that's nice.

322
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,609
Kaergaard? Not yet.

323
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,455
Oh, he's on bike. Then it'll be a while.
He called me privately.

324
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,653
- What do you care?
- It's a long story.

325
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,017
But you are in for a surprise.

326
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,940
A surprise?
What the hell is this?

327
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,128
What? Yes, of course you can come.
You're welcome. Goodbye.

328
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,213
Those folks from Copenhagen.

329
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,956
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Hald.

330
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,658
What is it that you want'?
Who are you?

331
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,062
Did your husband worry a lot lately?

332
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,450
Yes, perhaps a bit.

333
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,027
And he wasn't at home monday night, right?

334
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,534
You have to talk to him yourself.

335
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,803
Perhaps that won't be necessary now.

336
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,686
The killer?

337
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,858
- I suppose it could be me.
- Yes, so you say.

338
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,900
- If, there is a killer.
- But there is.

339
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,770
Yes, <i>so</i> YOU say.

340
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,302
I haven't got an alibi for
monday night.

341
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,195
I was home alone doing my nails.

342
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,326
Nobody will believe it can take
a whole night.

343
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,130
It is only a three quarters of
an hour drive to Arhus.

344
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,578
And I really need the money.

345
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,694
Currently I know no wealthy men.
Not wealthy enough at least.

346
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,583
- How well do detective novels do?
- Not that well.

347
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,734
I could use a brandy.
Would you mind?

348
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,695
- I gave up on being a writer.
- It didn't pay off well enough?

349
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,541
I found out I couldn't write.

350
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,373
- What are you doing now then?
- I'm a journalist.

351
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,867
Natural development
when you can't write.

352
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,461
By the way I once reviewed
one of your books.

353
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:56,063
I have my own column now,
But earlier I took everything I could get.

354
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,023
- How was your review then?
- Bad. The killer annoyed me.

355
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,764
Killers can be annoying.

356
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,778
On a psychological level he
was not right.

357
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,116
Was it the specific review,
which ended with:

358
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,976
"The author seems to find his
psychological insight in the gossip press"?

359
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,539
"As a writer he will soon be
as dead as one of his corpses"?

360
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,650
"He should commit a couple of murders
himself in order to survive"?

361
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,523
Neatly written, right?

362
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,047
I then decided that my first murder
should be that particularjournalist -

363
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,634
- but I couldn't find time to
go to AArhus.

364
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,494
Now is my chance, right?

365
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,391
On a psychological level he
was not right.

366
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:00,382
- Did you study psychology as well?
- I am too old. lwas shy.

367
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,614
Young men with beards and girls
and messy hair make me shy.

368
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,261
But well shaven men with
simple thoughts...

369
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,173
fit me just perfectly.

370
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,237
I'm sorry.

371
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,245
- May I clean the table now?
- Yes, please miss Joergensen.

372
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,624
- God knows what's keeping Merete.
- I will keep some supper for her.

373
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,168
Oh, I have an appointment with the
police. I have to go.

374
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,551
- Isn't this a beautiful living room'?
- Yes.

375
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,263
Uncle Joachim had an eye for aesthetics.
Perhaps not so much for comfort.

376
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,720
You should see our cabin.
It's nice.

377
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,990
And there is peace and quiet.

378
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,332
Excellent idea.

379
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,578
Tomorrow afternoon.

380
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,564
I'm so sorry. I was delayed.
I hope you've already eaten.

381
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,151
What has happened?

382
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,063
<i>This is what's happened.</i> We <i>want
to know what you know.</i>

383
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,253
Then it is true.

384
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,983
I think we did you wrong.
This was found on the floor in the living room.

385
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,956
I think Kaergaard was
one of the guests.

386
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,638
He was going to tell something
but was prevented.

387
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,050
Maybe. You must admit it
looked like suicide.

388
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,803
And you had bumped your head.
That's why we were suspicious.

389
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,235
Well. That's what you get
payed for.

390
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,294
But who on earth would want
to kill Joachim? Why?

391
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,841
Kaergaard there. Do you suppose
a <i>woman</i> could have done it?

392
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,513
Anybody could have killed a
man with that thing.

393
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,420
- Of who are you thinking?
- Just a thought.

394
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,937
- You have to tell if you know something.
- Yes, if I find out anything.

395
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,385
Don't try finding out anything.

396
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,800
You don't find us sufficiently skilled?

397
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,086
Iwill keep quiet.
Am I allowed to ring you?

398
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,616
Yes, please do.

399
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,166
John, is that you?

400
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,607
Who screamed?

401
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,217
My God. Miss Joergensen!

402
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,797
What's happened?

403
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,181
No! He was going to kill me.

404
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,981
- Did you see who it was?
- I was blinded by the light.

405
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,834
- I'll get the first aid.
- Let's turn on the light, like that.

406
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,759
I don't think it's...
It hurts a little.

407
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,305
Easy now. Let's take off the clothes.

408
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,101
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yes.

409
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,458
Bertel, what a time to arrive.

410
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,546
The police.

411
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,089
It's you. What is the matter?

412
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,508
I see?

413
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,412
Miss Joergensen?

414
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,773
I'll send Hald immediately.
I am waiting for a call from Arhus.

415
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,611
- This is the tool.
- Funny that he didn't take it with him.

416
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,798
I think he most likely was looking for
something. Not to steal anything.

417
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,060
Nobody must touch this. We need it
dusted for finger prints.

418
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,754
- You don't look too well.
- You don't look too well yourself.

419
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,183
No, all this messing around at night.
I wasn't aware you lived here.

420
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,646
Miss Joergensen only moved in yesterday.

421
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,530
Somebody who knew the house well would have
thought the living room floor empty then.

422
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,575
A drink anybody. I really need one?

423
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,984
- You arrived immediately after the assault?
- Yes

424
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,826
Peculiar time.

425
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,501
I wasn't able to leave earlier.
I was busy.

426
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:41,320
Hans Joergen says hello by the way.
I have classes with mr. Hald's son.

427
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,613
- When did you leave Arhus?
- at half past one.

428
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,351
Any witnesses?

429
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,545
I've just arrived and already I'm
accused of murder and arson etc.

430
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,524
You didn't catch a glimpse of
the perpetrator?

431
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,143
I was blinded by the lamp.
I couldn't see him.

432
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,143
But you are certain that it
was a man?

433
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,143
Well, I don't know. Why would
a woman...

434
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,541
It was Sander's idea.

435
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:25,545
I think it's all for now. I will
be back again tomorrow.

436
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,543
Are you mad, kid?

437
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,541
There was no danger. The safety
was on.

438
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,541
Where does he learn things
like that?

439
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,612
He found it in my coat.

440
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,521
John, it is not nice to go in people's
pockets. Hurry up to bed.

441
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,118
Goodnight.

442
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,806
Thank you, Bertel, you're the best.

443
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,813
How about Perry Mason there.
Don't you need one?

444
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,816
Thanks.

445
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,586
It is too bad about that boy.
Can I have a drink as well?

446
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,569
I wonder what he was looking for.

447
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,905
Something on the floor.
Something he missed.

448
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,038
If it was a lady it could have
been a hairpin.

449
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,537
- That is very compromising.
- Or a bra.

450
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,817
- Shame on you little brother.
- Just a moment.

451
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,756
- John?
- Yes, what is it?

452
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,848
- What are you doing there?
- I was supposed to <i>come,</i> right?

453
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,956
- We should solve this together.
- Yes, that's right.

454
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,543
As a matter of fact that's why I...

455
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,255
Tell me, John, what's in your pocket?

456
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,343
I don! know. Why?

457
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,787
- Why don't we give it a look?
- I suppose we could.

458
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,835
What are you going to do with
that disgusting mouse?

459
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,551
I would stuff it,
but then I forgot about it.

460
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,181
Is any of that something you
found in the living room?

461
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,912
Yes...

462
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,159
That one.

463
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,013
- When?
- Today.

464
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,916
Do you remember exactly where?

465
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,198
Yes.

466
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,940
Right there.

467
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,253
- We are all suspects.
- The ladies in particular.

468
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,145
You too.

469
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,847
Yes, I'm painfully aware of it.

470
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,062
I'm not particularly popular around here.

471
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,032
I'm off after the lawyer reads us
the will.

472
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,276
Mr. Sander wants to know where you were
monday night. Right?

473
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,820
Yes, please.

474
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,074
Monday night? lwas in
dr. Oscar Philipsen's class.

475
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,031
Like every monday night.
Bon appetite.

476
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,524
- We are going in fifteen minutes.
- I will be there.

477
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,353
- I suppose you are going going out.
- For some fresh air perhaps.

478
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,464
- How's your foot?
- Well.

479
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,238
We can go to the cabin
when I come back.

480
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,122
If you dare spending time
with a murder suspect.

481
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,189
- Be nice.
- Maybe.

482
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,457
Your mustn't do that.
You can't go around killing people.

483
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,662
Not with this.

484
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,777
What if it was one of the girls?

485
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,972
It was obviously you. You have a limp.

486
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,142
Do you know anybody around here
who has a limp?

487
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,819
Why?

488
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,496
Because the one who shot at me
the other night couldn't see me

489
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,456
- But he could hear me.
- Perhaps he thought you were someone else?

490
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,277
- Somebody with a limp?
- exactly.

491
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,115
Yes, clever.

492
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,067
I know someone with a limp.
Yes, it's him.

493
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,781
He is very scary.
And very strong.

494
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,863
He once beat up Bertel
in the city.

495
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,928
- Bertel? Why?
- I don't know.

496
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,270
- Who is it?
- He works in the lumberyard.

497
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,215
- I don't want to talk with you.
- Did you know dr. Lindberg?

498
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:19,095
You are that man from Copenhagen, who tripped
and fell at the dr. 's. I know him by reputation.

499
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,174
- But his nephew, Bertel?
- That scoundrel.

500
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,566
- Why did you beat him?
- Because he is a scoundrel.

501
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,830
- Where were you monday night?
- None of your business.

502
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,018
- Did you know that kaergaard is dead?
- Dead?

503
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:40,407
- Yes, murdered. Last night.
- Says who?

504
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,371
He was on his way to the police
to tell then something.

505
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,453
Did you know Kaergaard?

506
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,979
You still don't want to tell
where you were monday night?

507
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,050
Let me tell you something else.
Around here we take care of our own business.

508
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,366
We don't like strangers
sniffing around.

509
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:11,512
Keep your nose to yourself. Otherwise
it might end up broken.

510
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,574
- What's next?
- Home.

511
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,278
Are we not following him.
We can easily <i>catch</i> up with him.

512
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,927
- I need to go home to make a call.
- Afterwards then. We have to solve these murders.

513
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,634
- Aftenrvards I have a date.
- With who?

514
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,539
It's none of your business.

515
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,992
You should be a little more careful.
She's having a crush on you.

516
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,094
- Who?
- Eva. Girls are stupid.

517
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,056
Being wealthy is great.
He was much richer than we thought.

518
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,164
Bertel went off for Arhus immediately
to use his part.

519
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,578
- Bertel was not at school.
- How do you know that?

520
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,938
I called dr. Oscar Philipsen.

521
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,236
I see. Not that I am surprised the least.

522
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:00,575
He is not particularly determined.
He's been confused and restless.

523
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,924
He claims that law study is boring.
We are going up there.

524
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,977
Were you hurt?
I don'! understand.

525
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,088
I always make sure the car is in gear.
I'm certain I put it in gear.

526
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,864
I made you a drink.
I think we need it.

527
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,463
- That was close.
- The question is, who did it?

528
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,044
- What do you mean?
- I don't think it was an accident.

529
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,429
Please stop. You are fixated.
Cheers.

530
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:42,204
- That is the timber merchant.
- How do you know it was him?

531
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,239
I payed him a visit this morning.
He threatened me directly.

532
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,794
And I saw his car in the woods.

533
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,042
- Why did you visit the timber merchant.
- Because he has a limp.

534
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:03,211
I'm certain that your uncle's other
guest was him.

535
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:10,049
- He does look like a killer.
- I don't think it was him, though.

536
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,915
He looks like that and everybody
would be satisfied if it was him.

537
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,963
I suggest we call him the killer then -

538
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,497
and act awfully simple.

539
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,323
I'd rather you suspected me.

540
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,938
It would be wise. You don't know
what I can do.

541
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,665
My God!

542
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,954
It seems you are right once again.

543
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:18,493
He was struck down and was
unconsciousness when the car went down.

544
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,345
I can't see the connection between the doctor,
Kaergaard and the timber merchant though.

545
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:31,628
Why did they have to die.
And by who. I don't understand.

546
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,270
I've lived here most of my life.
I think I know people around here.

547
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:43,314
They are righteous and honest people.
I don't understand.

548
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,567
The timber merchant once
beat up Bertel. Did you know that?

549
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,656
Yes, he was flirting with his daughter.

550
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,863
She was a beautiful and lively girl.

551
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,768
Hard to image her as a wife of a priest.

552
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,353
She married a priest.

553
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,151
Kaergaard's son.

554
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,360
Yes, they married.

555
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,538
A year and a half ago.

556
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,481
John told me something.

557
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:33,670
Something that also happened here
a year and a half ago. An accident.

558
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,578
- But there is probably no connection.
- Perhaps there is.

559
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,108
Because it was Bertel who drove
the car.

560
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:48,487
It was the timber merchant's car.
And his daughter was with Bertel.

561
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,801
I remember that accident.
It was never solved.

562
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,166
We searched for that car but
without luck.

563
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,422
The blood test showed the
man was drunk -

564
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,597
- But no heirs and no life insurance.
Case got closed.

565
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,040
Let's see.

566
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,912
Yes, I remember.
There was a witness.

567
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:25,437
Dr Lindberg. He said it was a
car from AAlborg.

568
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:31,680
Lindberg lied to cover for Bertel,
and the two fathers avoided a scandal.

569
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,834
Kaergaarcl was priest and the man from the carpenter's
shop was proud to have him as son in law.

570
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,715
They agreed to keep silent and
hid the car at Kaergaard's workshop -

571
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,076
but somebody must have known.

572
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,143
- Blackmail.
- It doesn't quite fit.

573
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,980
Why would a blackmailer kill
his victims?

574
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:59,292
And why were they having dinner?

575
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,210
So far you are the only one
who have seen that dinner table

576
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,189
May I use your phone?

577
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,454
Hello?

578
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,783
- Lovely. Are you coming home now?
- Soon. Is Merete at home?

579
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,691
No, she's with dr. Lund.
Miss Joergensen is off. John is at sleep.

580
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,444
- Do you know what I am?
-I guess you are alone.

581
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,413
- All alone. Are you coming then?
- Very tempting.

582
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:44,222
- I have a surprise for you.
- What is it?

583
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,300
I know who the killer is.

584
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,817
The killer. Well, who is he then?

585
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,013
I will tell you if you come immediately.

586
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:01,292
- I have to take care of something first.
- Aren't you the least interested?

587
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,049
Yes. We are very interested in who
the killer is.

588
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,561
And of course you are looking for
some villain.

589
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,359
But there are none here.

590
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,946
All righteous and honest people.

591
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,831
- Even the killer is an honorable man.
- An honorable man?

592
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,690
But of course you are too stupid
to figure it out.

593
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,245
And you are the most stupid
if you don't come now.

594
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,350
- I'm all alone.
- I will be there <i>as</i> fast as I can.

595
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,850
You sound just like a tired husband.
How sad.

596
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,984
Listen. Could uncle Joachim cook?

597
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,122
- Not even an egg.
- That's what I thought.

598
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,689
So long.

599
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,957
Dr. Lindberg couldn't cook,
and miss Joergensen was off.

600
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:05,402
Merete Lindberg wasn't in the
cabin that night. John told me.

601
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:11,832
If she cooked the food, then she
<i>knows</i> the guests and perhaps even the killer.

602
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,060
If she knows, she might be in
real danger.

603
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,170
- Where is she?
- With dr. Lund.

604
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,486
<i>I'll</i> call you if there's anything.

605
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,990
Yes. That is right.
I did the cooking.

606
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:54,034
But for whom I don'! know.
Dr. Lindberg was terribly silent that day.

607
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,965
- Why didn't you tell us'?
- Awfully wrong of me, I know.

608
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,725
- Where were you the rest of the evening?
- That's exactly why.

609
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,559
Iwas afraid that I had to tell...

610
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,359
Mrs. Lindberg was with me.
We have been seeing each other some time -

611
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,095
- but we've been very discrete
to avoid the talk.

612
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,486
I was getting a divorce,
and today it is settled.

613
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,255
That's why I asked mrs. Lindberg
to come.

614
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:34,427
Well. We can ask mrs. Lindberg then

615
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,868
She had a theory that our killer was
a righteous and an honorable man.

616
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,933
I see.

617
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,662
Oh, is it you?

618
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:07,319
Just a couple of questions about
the burglary last night.

619
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,987
If it's alright?

620
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,354
- Let me.
- Thank you.

621
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,934
I brought this back. There were
no important fingerprints.

622
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,150
I am short of a few informations
for the report. If we could just...

623
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,642
Excuse me for a moment.

624
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,124
Hello. Thank heaven. You must
get back immediately.

625
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,543
- Are you still being alone.
- He's here.

626
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,644
- Who.
- I'm certain. Everything fits. Even the button.

627
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,644
Hello! Eva. Hello!

628
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:38,116
You already guessed it?
And mr. Sander?

629
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:44,524
- He doesn't know who.
- But he is coming?

630
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,623
We better wait for him.

631
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:55,624
- What are you going to do?
- Let's sit.

632
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,526
- Mr. Hald, don't you think...
- How did you find out?

633
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,526
Mr. Hald, you are not a
criminal.

634
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:26,545
You are an honorable man. Nobody will
think you are capable of crime.

635
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:33,535
But when we stop looking for
a villain you're the only one left.

636
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,122
The death of Kaergaard for instance.

637
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,505
Only four people knew he
was going to the police.

638
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,515
His wife, Duus Jensen, mr. Sander
and yourself.

639
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,505
Others will probably find out
soon, mr. Hald.

640
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,160
Peter Sander perhaps. But no
other. And we are waiting for him.

641
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,247
It is easy to imagine.

642
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,707
You saw the timber merchant's
car in Kaergaard's workshop.

643
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,115
You asked questions.
Kaergaard was nervous.

644
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,360
And then there was uncle Joachim.

645
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,946
He called me and asked me to come.

646
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,252
Your uncle was very authoritative.

647
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,730
He didn't think those young people -

648
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,864
- should ruin their lives
because of an accident.

649
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,723
I have a son myself.
I had to understand.

650
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:49,217
- I left the doctor with 1000 DKK.
- And promised to keep quiet.

651
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,356
Only too late did I realize.
I wanted to give the money back -

652
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,590
- but I was too tempted and when
I had spend all the money...

653
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:03,065
- You began to hate him.
- It was his fault and the others.

654
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:08,272
They were protecting their children.
Why shouldn't I protect my own?

655
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,061
My son's studies. They were
expensive. They payed -

656
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:19,108
- until the doctor finally didn't
want to anymore. He called the others.

657
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:24,518
I went out here and arrived just
in time. He couldn't convince the others.

658
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,506
The doctor got excited and
threatened us with his gun.

659
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,063
I tried to disarm him and then
the gun went off.

660
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,864
- That's how it went.
- An honorable man turned into a killer.

661
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,224
Kaergaard couldn't take it but
the man from the carpenter's was tough.

662
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:08,006
He asked me to get rid of the
man from Copenhagen. He was too curious.

663
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,992
The carpenter's was right, but
he shouldn't have talked to me like that.

664
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,936
Like I was a criminal.
He shouldn't have done that.

665
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:28,080
I am certain everybody will understand
when they hear the truth.

666
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,874
The truth?

667
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,864
The truth is that I am an
honorable man.

668
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,166
And nobody will ever know
differently.

669
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,593
<i>Nobody will ever know.</i>

670
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,808
You won't get away with this.
It will be revealed.

671
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:02,201
No, no. Nobody could ever
dream about thinking such of me.

672
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,532
I have always been respected.
Nobody will be suspicious.

673
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,466
Please be calm and come to your
senses, Hald. Put that gun away.

674
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:17,611
No, I have to use this gun now.
I have never done it before -

675
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,906
- because we have to account for
the bullets -

676
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,968
- but right now I will make an
exception. I am going to use it.

677
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,079
Ha! It doesn't work.

678
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:43,187
No bullets.

679
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,457
I found it in your coat.

680
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,600
I took out all the bullets.

681
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,020
No! You are lying.

682
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,380
Well, partner. You did fine.

683
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:21,692
You better give me those bullets.
Those are not toys.

684
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:39,480
Tell me, what is in your pocket?

685
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:50,519
What is the matter?
You can't take a little excitement?

686
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,280
I think you are a hero.
