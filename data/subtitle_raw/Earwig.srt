1
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,192
- <i>Scellinc...</i>
- Sir.

2
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,233
<i>How is the girl?</i>

3
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,150
Everything is well, sir.

4
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,692
She sleeps soundly,
her appetite is good.

5
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,317
All is as it should be.

6
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:19,858
<i>And the teeth?</i>

7
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:22,275
Everything is well, sir.

8
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,233
<i>The month's remittance
has been sent.</i>

9
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,442
<i>- Do you require anything else?
</i>- No, sir.

10
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,025
<i>There will be
no further payments.</i>

11
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:36,858
Sir?

12
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:41,025
<i>You must start preparing
the girl to leave.</i>

13
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,567
Leave?

14
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:50,942
<i>You will bring her to us
on the 6th of next month,</i>

15
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,817
<i>in 13 days' time.</i>

16
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:57,692
<i>In the meantime,
you must teach her</i>

17
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,608
<i>how to behave outside.</i>

18
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:02,025
<i>Do you understand, Scellinc?</i>

19
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,192
Yes, sir.

20
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,900
You must get used
to being outside.

21
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,192
Mia!

22
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,650
Mia!

23
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:01,567
Mia!

24
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,983
Stop it!

25
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,817
Stop.

26
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:43,233
- What can I get you?
- A tripel.

27
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,025
May I?

28
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:51,650
I'm a traveller, sir,

29
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,275
a stranger to this city.

30
00:43:57,983 --> 00:43:59,317
I live far away...

31
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:04,108
in the shadow
of a great cathedral.

32
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,483
No matter.

33
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:19,858
I think I shall join you.

34
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:43,275
Thank you.

35
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:04,442
And now, sir...

36
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,275
What's your name?

37
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:13,567
Albert Scellinc.

38
00:45:18,192 --> 00:45:20,192
Albert...

39
00:45:21,983 --> 00:45:23,192
We've met before,

40
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:26,025
I'm sure of it.

41
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,942
Although for the moment,

42
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:33,192
I can't quite recall where.

43
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:37,442
On the field
of conflict, perhaps...

44
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:45,108
covered in mud, blood and shit.

45
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,442
Or was it long before

46
00:45:58,775 --> 00:45:59,983
at the orphanage?

47
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,150
No...

48
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,192
No, in fact, I believe
it was after the war,

49
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,692
when you had a wife.

50
00:46:21,858 --> 00:46:22,942
Wife?

51
00:46:25,317 --> 00:46:27,983
Didn't you take a wife
after the war?

52
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:35,067
I don't...
I don't have a wife!

53
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,775
Marie is dead...

54
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:42,233
it's true...

55
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,192
But then there's the other one.

56
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:57,150
She's waking.

57
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,733
I don't have a wife!

58
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,192
A child, then.

59
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,150
An abandoned child.

60
00:47:28,942 --> 00:47:30,483
It's on the house.

61
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,817
Thank you, Celeste.

62
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:47,650
Have you never wondered
what it would be like

63
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:49,150
to be someone else?

64
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:51,483
Hmm?

65
00:47:52,692 --> 00:47:53,692
Her,

66
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:56,400
for example?

67
00:47:58,483 --> 00:48:01,608
Please, stop!

68
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:08,150
No?

69
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:15,608
Then perhaps the lovely Celeste?

70
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,442
So, it's her.

71
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:31,108
I thought so.

72
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,400
Marie...

73
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,233
<i>How is the girl?</i>

74
00:53:58,942 --> 00:54:00,900
Everything is well, sir.

75
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:05,483
She sleeps soundly,
her appetite is good.

76
00:54:26,983 --> 00:54:28,650
Everything is as it should be.

77
00:55:03,817 --> 00:55:06,233
I know, I know.

78
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:13,650
I'm here.

79
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:18,567
Who are you?

80
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,567
Don't try to talk.

81
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,025
Go back to sleep.

82
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:36,483
My name is Laurence.

83
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:39,025
I'm going to take care
of everything.

84
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:52,525
I want her moved
to a private room.

85
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:56,817
I will cover the costs.

86
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,233
What matters above all

87
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:01,608
is that she receives
the very best care.

88
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,983
If I might...

89
00:57:04,608 --> 00:57:06,067
Come on, Celeste.

90
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:08,942
You need to get well.

91
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:34,483
Good. Good, good, good, good.

92
01:03:55,192 --> 01:03:57,192
You will find these
satisfactory.

93
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:29,525
We need your help

94
01:07:31,775 --> 01:07:33,067
with the teeth.

95
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:38,192
You must ask the masters
for help.

96
01:07:39,275 --> 01:07:40,483
Masters?

97
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:46,192
Yes, our masters.

98
01:08:11,942 --> 01:08:13,692
I have to leave soon.

99
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:19,317
On the 6th.

100
01:08:24,357 --> 01:08:27,400
The house has been empty
since my mother died.

101
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:37,567
It's too big for one person.

102
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,025
The gardens will be lovely
in winter.

103
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:00,817
I would be honoured
if you would agree

104
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,482
to come with me...

105
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:06,650
as my guest.

106
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:12,357
For as long as you need.

107
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:18,817
Is there really anything
keeping you here?

108
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,358
Mr Scellinc?

109
01:12:44,317 --> 01:12:46,317
Have you informed our masters?

110
01:12:51,025 --> 01:12:54,858
Have you informed our masters
that I need assistance?

111
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:56,317
I don't understand.

112
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,608
Have you informed our masters
that I need assistance?

113
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,858
What's the matter?

114
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,817
Dirty, sneaking bitch!

115
01:13:28,817 --> 01:13:31,150
- My God...
- What are you doing?

116
01:16:23,608 --> 01:16:24,692
I will...

117
01:16:29,233 --> 01:16:30,942
I will go with you.

118
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:46,983
Do you not recognise me?

119
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,400
I know who you are.

120
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:36,900
Go and fetch the girl.

121
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:21,942
Come.

122
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:24,108
Mia...

123
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,025
Put that thing away.

124
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:07,192
On the table.

125
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,775
Lie down on the table.

126
01:20:59,733 --> 01:21:01,358
This will take some time.

127
01:21:06,733 --> 01:21:08,358
Please leave us alone.

128
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:41,733
Open.

129
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:46,317
Wider.

130
01:23:29,525 --> 01:23:30,983
It's a different system now.

131
01:23:31,983 --> 01:23:34,150
The glass implants
are permanent.

132
01:23:36,108 --> 01:23:38,192
You must attend scrupulously
to the girl's hygiene

133
01:23:38,275 --> 01:23:39,608
in the days to come.

134
01:23:42,858 --> 01:23:45,400
Saltwater will keep her mouth
free of infection.

135
01:23:52,442 --> 01:23:53,733
If you can manage that,

136
01:23:53,817 --> 01:23:55,150
there'll be no need
for me to return

137
01:23:55,233 --> 01:23:56,483
before your departure.

138
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,650
Argh!

139
01:26:29,483 --> 01:26:30,817
Argh!

140
01:29:17,983 --> 01:29:19,025
Not long now.

141
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:24,692
It hurts.

142
01:29:27,692 --> 01:29:29,400
Laurence, please.

143
01:30:11,942 --> 01:30:13,025
I'm sure
that in our life together,

144
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:15,358
you will no longer feel
such need of it.

145
01:32:29,983 --> 01:32:31,358
May I help you, madam?

146
01:36:40,608 --> 01:36:41,817
It's on the house.

147
01:40:24,025 --> 01:40:25,025
Mmm.

148
01:44:56,442 --> 01:44:58,150
I have brought the child,

149
01:44:59,233 --> 01:45:00,400
as I was asked.

150
01:45:02,442 --> 01:45:04,442
I am Albert Scellinc.

151
01:45:18,525 --> 01:45:20,150
Please wait in the hall.

152
01:46:01,775 --> 01:46:04,067
She has been well cared for.

153
01:46:06,525 --> 01:46:08,192
So I can see.

154
01:46:16,983 --> 01:46:19,733
Everything is as it should be.

155
01:46:22,067 --> 01:46:23,775
You mustn't be afraid.

156
01:46:34,942 --> 01:46:36,150
Perfect!

157
01:46:38,067 --> 01:46:42,192
No doubt you have
papers for me to sign.

158
01:46:43,483 --> 01:46:46,650
They are waiting
for you at reception.

159
01:46:55,567 --> 01:46:57,775
Will you be leaving
anything with her?

160
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,567
Your daughter.

161
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,858
Will you be leaving anything
with her?

162
01:47:05,942 --> 01:47:07,400
She's not my daughter.

163
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,442
But you're signing for her.

164
01:47:11,275 --> 01:47:12,942
I am just her keeper.

165
01:47:17,608 --> 01:47:18,942
Look.

166
01:47:33,567 --> 01:47:34,692
It's a lie.

167
01:49:57,983 --> 01:49:58,983
Marie.
