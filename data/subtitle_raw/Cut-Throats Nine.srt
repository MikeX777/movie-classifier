1
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,533
(dramatic music)

2
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,701
- [Man Voiceover] A good
many years have passed since

3
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,534
that day I arrived
at Golden Sand.

4
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:23,601
A lot of water under the bridge.

5
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:26,868
I can still remember how
desolate that mine looked.

6
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,201
Four lost houses in a
lost corner of the world.

7
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:32,901
I can't really say I have
a lot of good memories

8
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:37,268
of my stay there but one
thing's sure, in Golden Sand,

9
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,701
a big important part
of me was left buried.

10
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,435
(dramatic music)

11
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:33,868
I don't know how often I
dreamed of leaving the mine.

12
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:36,368
It was constantly on my mind.

13
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,368
Then finally exactly
half an hour ago,

14
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,701
everything was behind me.

15
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,468
We were all part and
parcel of a big rat trap.

16
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,968
Maybe we can get out if we try,

17
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,768
but I have my doubts that
it will ever get through

18
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,269
the 400 miles between
here and Fort Green.

19
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,035
Dick Paterson.

20
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,668
Committed enough crimes to
have been condemned by law

21
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,001
to a chain gang forever,
but doctors say that forever

22
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,868
is about six months
at the outside.

23
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,369
(Dick coughs)

24
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:50,534
Joe Ferrell.

25
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,334
El Comanchero.

26
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,702
Ruthless, blood-thirsty, ice.

27
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,268
He started out plucking scalps
for the Indians and wound up

28
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,001
killing his own brothers
and others of his race.

29
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:03,301
Chain gang for life.

30
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:04,302
Slim.

31
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:05,634
A snake.

32
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:07,668
A backstabbing traitor.

33
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,502
Life on the chain
gang for murder.

34
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:14,001
Ray Brewster.

35
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,301
The Torch.

36
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,302
Arsonist, thief, killer.

37
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:20,434
Chain gang for life.

38
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:23,001
Thomas Lawrence, Dandy Tom.

39
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:27,169
Gambler, blackmailer, forger
and naturally, killer.

40
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,835
Hard labor for life.

41
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,734
John Weasel McFarland, sentenced
to life on a chain gang

42
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,734
for robbery, rape and murder.

43
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,568
Has one good quality.

44
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,402
He's probably insane.

45
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,234
Dean Marlowe.

46
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:46,568
No one knows what he's in for,

47
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,068
but he's got life at hard labor.

48
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,069
(suspenseful music)

49
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:07,968
- Hey, when are you gonna
stop the damn wagon?

50
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,734
I gotta go bad.

51
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:13,902
- Do it in your pants!
(Thomas laughs)

52
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,301
(men laugh)

53
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:27,134
- Order's completed, soldier.

54
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:29,334
(men laugh)

55
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:32,335
(suspenseful music)

56
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:00,202
- No matter what
happens, don't bar.

57
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,568
- Thinkin' over
your life, Paterson?

58
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,734
Your whole life passes in front
of ya just before you die.

59
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,634
Great big flashes.

60
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,401
You said it yourself.

61
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:22,135
- How would you know?

62
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:24,868
You never died before.

63
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:26,901
- The rope was around my neck.

64
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:30,368
So I saw those flashes
alright, dirty as life.

65
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,769
Dirty as your life, Paterson.

66
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:37,869
Last minute they committed the
sentence to life like this.

67
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:40,768
- That was bad luck.

68
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,134
- Yeah, that's right.

69
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,969
And this is the worst.

70
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:49,601
- Hello there, friends, hello!

71
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:53,269
Old Buddy been waitin'
here quite some time!

72
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,101
- Not a sound.

73
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,301
Not a whisper.

74
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:02,301
- Now what in the
hell took you so long?

75
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:07,268
Did you clean out the
whole mine, huh? (laughs)

76
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,301
No, you got nothin' to
be scared of, soldier.

77
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,268
You have to understand, though,

78
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,934
only thing that
interests us is the gold.

79
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:18,434
Now, you get that to me and
your men are free to go,

80
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,434
to get more gold for me!

81
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:22,434
Is that right, family?

82
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,102
(loud laughter)

83
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,935
(gun fires)

84
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:40,768
Don't shoot anymore, children.

85
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,935
They're mighty good folks!

86
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:45,334
Hold it!

87
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:48,969
I don't want any more snipin'
at these bastards, ya hear!

88
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,435
Dismount.

89
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:06,002
(chuckles)

90
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:09,335
Disarm them.

91
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:14,035
My son, my youngest.

92
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,702
(chuckles)

93
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:32,668
Now you leave those alone, Pa!

94
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,334
You sure make me ashamed
to have you along!

95
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:39,002
His teeth, you should
check his teeth first.

96
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,869
(suspenseful music)

97
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:55,102
Sergeant.

98
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,401
Uh, who are they?

99
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:01,334
- Chain gang, they
work in the mine.

100
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:02,968
We're taking them to Fort Green.

101
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:04,334
- And uh, the gold?

102
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,234
- We haven't got
any gold, Buddy.

103
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,634
See, you robbed us too often.

104
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:08,901
(Buddy laughs)

105
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,669
- You damn liar, you!

106
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,468
Terrance, find that gold!

107
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:15,969
Find it, you hear!

108
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:22,402
(Sergeant groans)

109
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:38,601
You dogs in there, I'm
asking you where the gold is.

110
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:40,069
- You, come down.

111
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:46,969
(suspenseful music)
(man groans)

112
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:52,134
Where is it?

113
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,568
- Look in here.

114
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:55,902
(men laugh)

115
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,001
- Pa, there ain't nothin' here.

116
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,069
(groans)

117
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,468
(Buddy giggles)

118
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:10,634
- We waited months here, in
the middle of starvation,

119
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:14,101
cold and calamities and
things, and you wanna know why?

120
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:16,934
Because I was expectin'
to steal your gold.

121
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,401
Now you listen
real good, my son.

122
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:22,301
You'll return to the mine, and
you tell your chief he better

123
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:25,568
send us all that gold or I'll
murder all your buddies here!

124
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:26,934
And then I'll attack the camp

125
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,001
and I'll burn it to the ground!

126
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,669
Get 'em movin', son.

127
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:34,101
(horse neighs)

128
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,001
(gun fires)

129
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,734
Have a nice trip, friends!

130
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:41,902
Good luck and God
bless ya! (laughs)

131
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,435
(Sergeant groans)

132
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:52,769
(dramatic music)

133
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:15,969
- Ho!

134
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,401
Ho!

135
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:20,969
- We gotta get out, no
man can stop those horses!

136
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:24,335
Chain?

137
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:30,835
- Whoa!

138
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,402
Hold it!

139
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,369
Ho!

140
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,901
Jump when I tell you to.

141
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:42,902
Ho!

142
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,702
Go on!

143
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:55,669
(dark orchestral music)

144
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,769
(screams)

145
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:55,534
(horses neigh)

146
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:58,468
(men grunt and groan)

147
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,601
(horses neigh)

148
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:03,934
(men grunt and groan)

149
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:06,502
(horses neigh)

150
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,202
- Cathy.

151
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,801
Are you alright?

152
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,802
- Yes.

153
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:28,969
- Come on.

154
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:37,935
(men groan)

155
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,101
- It's my leg.

156
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,935
It's broken, it's bad.

157
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,069
(groans)

158
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:08,269
- Look.

159
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,101
What good is that, Sergeant?

160
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:21,668
No one's getting
out of this alive.

161
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:25,835
Wagon's destroyed and Slim,
he can't walk an inch.

162
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,034
- Will you cut us loose?

163
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,934
- Mm-mm, you'll go on like that.

164
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:35,501
- You ain't about to
escape either, Brown.

165
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,668
I expect to watch
you die real soon,

166
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,768
and your daughter
will go before you.

167
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,668
- I gotta get us to Fort
Green, I figure I'm complying

168
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:45,001
with orders with those
who remain alive.

169
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,401
Load the provisions
onto the horses

170
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:47,834
and get ready to move out.

171
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,034
Now, get moving.

172
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,535
- What about Slim?

173
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:53,834
- You'll carry him in turns.

174
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,101
- I have an idea
about that, Sergeant.

175
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:59,601
- Hold onto it and
do what you're told.

176
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:01,434
- Let's say I don't.

177
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:04,968
- Then I'll put a
bullet in your guts.

178
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:07,401
Won't be at all difficult to
separate you and your chain.

179
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:08,902
- Exactly my idea.

180
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,302
Do it to Slim.

181
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:16,969
Empty out the wagon.

182
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,969
(upbeat whistling)

183
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:27,434
♪ Pig named Brown

184
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:30,568
♪ You will find

We'll camp here for the night.

Ain't you gonna help me?

211
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,769
- There's one way
you could help.

212
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:22,535
- [Ray] Yeah, all you
have to do is die.

213
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:49,701
- Divide up these provisions.

214
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,301
They've got to last six days.

215
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:54,268

00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,269

(Cathy gasps)

223
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:50,902
- Who did it?

224
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,868
Better give me the truth.

225
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:23,869
Who did it?

226
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:28,001
- He would have died anyway.

227
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,669
Hand us the machete.

228
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,268
- Who was it?

229
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,002
- He was a heavy
load, unnecessary.

230
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,768
- Yeah, he was and he is.

231
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:43,334
The body will still have to
be carried until one of you

232
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,501
decides to speak out.

233
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,434
Cover him with a
blanket and get going.

234
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:50,935

235
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:58,402
(horses neigh)

236
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,569
Ho.

237
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:08,669
Ho.

238
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:13,901
(horse neighs)

239
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:16,902
- [Cathy] He's got
a broken leg, Pa.

240
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,968
(horse neighs)

241
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:23,302
(gun fires)

242
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:43,568
- You boys ever hunt bear?

243
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,568
You just grab one of the cubs

244
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:50,334
and hang 'em up by
a paw so he yells.

245
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,501
And papa bear listens,

246
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:54,434
you wait 'til he gets close,

247
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:58,635
and then you get him
real good. (chuckles)

248
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:03,634
Dean, you could trap a
bear cub if you wanted to,

249
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,734
with no trouble at all.

250
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:08,068
She'd trust you, I think.

251
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,902
- My hands are frozen.

252
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:16,534
- I'd give up half
my life right now

253
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,901
for a barrel of good whisky.

254
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,234
- If you gave up half your life,

255
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:23,801
you wouldn't have
time to drink it.

256
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,034
- That's about it for
the provisions, Sergeant.

257
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:30,468
- I told you six days,
it's up day after tomorrow.

258
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:32,834
- Just how far do you think
you can push men anyhow?

259
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,669
- Right to Fort Green.

260
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:42,802
On your feet.

261
00:22:45,702 --> 00:22:49,202
(moody atmospheric music)

262
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:19,602
(moody atmospheric music)

263
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:13,935
Hey, wait.

264
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:18,802
Go on ahead.

265
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:24,369
- He'll never make
it with a mare.

266
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:39,168
- Come on!
(horse neighs)

267
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:40,002
Get up!

268
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,768
(horse neighs)

269
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:42,769
Come on.

270
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:45,934
Come on!
(horse neighs)

271
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:47,101
Yah!

272
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:47,935
Yeah!

273
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:48,935
Get up!

274
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:51,602
(horse neighs)

275
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:52,602
(gun fires)

276
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:55,169
(horse neighs)

277
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:55,501
Don't ever get that close again.

278
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:56,502
Do you hear?

279
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,902
(dark orchestral music)

280
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,634
Cathy, will you ever forgive me?

281
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:09,734
- [Cathy] For what?

282
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,401
There was no other way.

283
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,068
We couldn't be separated, so...

284
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:15,334
- [Brown] I feel
responsible for all this.

285
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:17,468
My mistakes always come
crashing down on you.

286
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:18,901
- [Cathy] It's not your fault.

287
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,634
I mean, all the
things that happened.

288
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:21,968
- [Brown] I never should
have taken you away

289
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:23,234
from Golden Sand.

290
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:25,568
- [Cathy] I was happy
to be at your side, Pa.

291
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:27,568
- [Brown] She begged
me so many times,

292
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:29,468
for us to pack it
in and leave there,

293
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,601
but I never listened.

294
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:33,668
- [Cathy] Remember
her last birthday,

295
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:35,468
how she laughed so hard
she couldn't blow out

296
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,901
all the candles and
we had to help her?

297
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:41,634
- I only remember
she died too young.

298
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:44,902
And that one of those
men murdered her.

299
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:09,002
(men laugh)

300
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:16,635
(Cathy screams)
(dramatic music)

301
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:21,635
Take him outta there.

302
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:30,802
- Go on, do it.

303
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:34,801
He had an accident.

304
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:39,168
- Yeah, just a little
spark and, boom. (chuckles)

305
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,801
- He's all ashes and
he smells, Sergeant.

306
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:44,901
Just one blow of the
machete and he's finished.

307
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:48,635
Do you expect the men
to carry a load of rot?

308
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:13,369
- The machete.

309
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,202
(ominous music)

310
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:35,735
(gun fires)

311
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,269
(clinking)

312
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:20,769
(clinking)

313
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,602
- Cut it out.

314
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,801
- Gold, it's gold!

315
00:29:40,802 --> 00:29:42,634
- Let me see that!
(dramatic music)

316
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:43,868
- Look!

317
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,202
(men laugh)

318
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:53,968
Gold, it's gold!

319
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:56,302
(men laugh)

320
00:29:58,302 --> 00:29:59,602
- Is that true?

321
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:04,669
- It's gold!

322
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,769
- Enough of that!

323
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:18,334
- The chain is gold, Sergeant.

324
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:20,002
You knew about this.

325
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,701
- Your situation remains
the same, gold or not.

326
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,535
- You knew about this.

327
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:28,769
You're a dirty snake, Brown!

328
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:33,434
You didn't have orders
to transfer us anywhere.

329
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:37,034
All you wanted to do was
to transfer that gold

330
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,868
without gettin' robbed, right?

331
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,534
- It could have cost us
our lives, Serge, you know.

332
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,301
- I'm gonna tear you
into bits and pieces

333
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:46,201
before this thing
is over, Sergeant.

334
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:47,202
I swear.

335
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:49,768
- About time to march on.

336
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,601
- What if we don't want to?

337
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:52,768
- We'll go it alone.

338
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,268
- Without the gold?

339
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,602
- Oh no, I'll take the gold.

340
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,734
- You and you daughter
couldn't pack this load.

341
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,501
Not even a mile or two.

342
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:07,168
- Now you need all of
us, Sergeant, don't you?

343
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:08,668
- You're mistaken.

344
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:10,768
I could bury all the gold
with your rotten corpses

345
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,934
and come back for it later.

346
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,668
- You wouldn't do it.

347
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,268
- Anybody able to stop me?

348
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:19,369
- You'd like that
a lot, wouldn't ya?

349
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:24,169
You took us out of the
mines to murder us.

350
00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:29,502
You're still sure that one of
us killed your wife, ain't ya?

351
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:37,668
- Let's go.

352
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,435
- I ain't takin'
a step from here.

353
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,769
- That's right.

354
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,669
(suspenseful music)

355
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:07,735
- I said get goin'.

356
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:25,902
(gun fires)
(screams)

357
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:36,135
- That makes one less
on your list, Sergeant.

358
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,402
- Couldn't have done
it better myself.

359
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:58,068
- You didn't have to do that.

360
00:32:58,069 --> 00:32:59,468
- Are you goin'?

361
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:02,135
(ominous music)

362
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:31,635
I just had to, Cathy.

363
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,501
It's the only way we'll
ever get to Fort Green.

364
00:33:35,502 --> 00:33:37,068
- To be sure you get revenge,

365
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:40,734
you're going to have to
murder four innocent men.

366
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:44,634
- Each one of those men
deserves the gallows.

367
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:46,701
I just hope you never have
to see what they might do

368
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:49,134
if they trapped me.

369
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:52,035
- I've seen what
you're capable of.

370
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:54,201
- I've been entrusted
with a mission

371
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:55,868
and I'm going to complete it.

372
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,834
- Don't start lying to me.

373
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,768
I know now why you did it.

374
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:01,601
- Who are you defending?

375
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:04,468
All of them or
one in particular?

376
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:06,735
- That's right, all, and...

377
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:09,468
One in particular.

378
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,969
(moody atmospheric music)

379
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:18,035
(strong winds)

380
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:33,102
- They can't take it
much longer, boss.

381
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,069
- Be more careful.

382
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:30,202
- This is our chance.

383
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:33,569
Keep your damn wits about you.

384
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:38,368
- You heard what I said.

385
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,969
Now watch yourself.

386
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,235
(chuckles)

387
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:08,102
(strong winds)

388
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:11,735
- Hey.

389
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:12,735
Look at him.

390
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:18,469
(strong winds)

391
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:36,735
(door opens)

392
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:43,869
(approaching footsteps)
(chain rattles)

393
00:39:49,402 --> 00:39:53,569
(thuds)
(Brown groans)

394
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:57,534
(chuckles)

395
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:59,935
(Cathy sobs)

396
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:09,869
(Brown groans)

397
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:16,635
(thuds)
(Brown groans)

398
00:40:19,902 --> 00:40:24,069
(Cathy sobs)
(Brown groans)

399
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,468
- That'll be enough.

400
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,968
You'll make it too
easy for him to die.

401
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,634
Much too easy.

402
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:35,634
- I want him to die real slow.

403
00:40:35,635 --> 00:40:36,635
- Yeah.

404
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,468
Like the rest of us are doing.

405
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:43,902
(Cathy sobs)

406
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,402
(chuckles)

407
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:04,601
- Leave her alone.

408
00:41:04,602 --> 00:41:07,001
- [Thomas] Are you
standing up for them?

409
00:41:07,002 --> 00:41:09,868
- I said leave her alone.

410
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:13,268
- [Thomas] Oh,
it's his daughter!

411
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:16,269
(grunts and groans)

412
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,102
(suspenseful music)

413
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:24,869
(Cathy whines)

414
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:03,935
- No!

415
00:43:06,435 --> 00:43:09,835
(Cathy whines and moans)

416
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:11,902
No!

417
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:15,569
(men laugh)

418
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:30,902
(Cathy whines and groans)

419
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:47,335
(dark piano music)

420
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:38,334
- God damn chain.

421
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:40,568
Are we never gonna
get rid of it?

422
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,401
- Don't gripe.

423
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:44,235
So far luck's with us.

424
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:47,801
And you've had enough to drink.

425
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:49,035
- Let me alone.

426
00:44:57,535 --> 00:44:59,634
(chuckles)

427
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:03,201
Now you look at
me, Sergeant Brown.

428
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:06,034
Yeah, one of us
murdered your woman.

429
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:08,901
(chuckles)

430
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:11,068
Now we're gonna see that
you get fixed up good,

431
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:13,702
you can be sure of that, Brown.

432
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:17,934
Because a man like you
deserves a sentence too.

433
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:20,035
(laughs)

434
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:25,701
Would you like to know
who murdered your wife?

435
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:27,935
(chuckles)

436
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:33,702
You'll be dead and buried
without ever knowing.

437
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,202
(laughs)

438
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:43,635
(loud screams)

439
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:56,235
(loud screams)
(laughing)

440
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:08,301
(smashing)

441
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:11,269
(crackling flames)

442
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:37,001
Even if it is gold, I'd
give away half this chain

443
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,501
for a nice hunk of bread.

444
00:46:38,502 --> 00:46:40,301
- Yeah, pretty soon you'll
wanna give it all away,

445
00:46:40,302 --> 00:46:43,668
just so as you won't
have to carry it.

446
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:45,368
- Still carrying the girl.

447
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,134
What's the matter with her?

448
00:46:48,135 --> 00:46:50,268
- Looks if she's gone crazy.
- Lay off, you hear?

449
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:51,301
- Why don't you turn her loose?

450
00:46:51,302 --> 00:46:52,469
- Settle down.

451
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:01,869
- Now let me see.

452
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:06,834
We're about here and those are
the Salmon River Mountains,

453
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:08,834
right behind Fort Green.

454
00:47:08,835 --> 00:47:10,668
- That's pretty risky.

455
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:14,001
We might stumble
across a stray patrol.

456
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:16,501
Better go to the other side.

457
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:17,869
Towards Lewiston.

458
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:21,334
- Much too long that way.

459
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:22,868
We don't have the
strength left to make it

460
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:24,334
as far as that, Ray.

461
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:27,401
- A mile away from the fort
there's a farm, Snake Caldwell.

462
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:28,868
We'll go in by night.

463
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:30,168
There we can get
rid of these chains,

464
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:32,334
and get some horses and guns.

465
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:33,335
Ride out by dawn.

466
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:35,001
- Are you loco?

467
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:38,268
There's always soldiers
around there drinkin'.

468
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:42,435
- Too bad for the soldiers.
(men laugh)

469
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:52,769
(moody atmospheric music)

470
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:29,002
(ominous music)

471
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:17,469
- I've got a good
mind to kill you.

472
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:22,501
But while we're tied
up by this chain,

473
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:26,669
the life of each of us depends
on the life of the rest.

474
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:54,835
Get down.

475
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:01,969
(suspenseful music)

476
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:18,469
(gun fires)

477
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:23,301
- You never shot a pistol
more than three feet.

478
00:50:23,302 --> 00:50:25,035
Across a poker table.

479
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:44,468
- I remember one time
in San Francisco.

480
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:49,068
I went to a restaurant
with white table cloths.

481
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:52,502
The whole place smelled
of roast chicken.

482
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,369
I had me orange duck.

483
00:50:58,535 --> 00:50:59,535
Dry rum.

484
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:03,702
- Shut your mouth
before I shut it for ya.

485
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:06,568
- Save your strength, fellas.

486
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:08,434
We've got a hell of a way to go.

487
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:11,868
- I always dreamed
of dying filthy rich.

488
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,102
(chuckles)

489
00:51:16,135 --> 00:51:19,301
And I think I'll get to do it.

490
00:51:19,302 --> 00:51:23,468
- Don't worry about it,
I'll close your eyes,

491
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:26,134
and relieve you of that
weight you're carrying.

492
00:51:26,135 --> 00:51:28,235
(laughs)

493
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:31,769
- Try to sleep, boys.

494
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:38,935
(chain clinks)

495
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:44,869
(suspenseful music)

496
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:12,768
(gun fires)

497
00:52:12,769 --> 00:52:15,035
(chuckles)

498
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:30,369
- Dead.

499
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:34,935
I still got three bullets.

500
00:53:04,902 --> 00:53:08,169
- Don't burn up any
more time with her.

501
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:23,834
- One more like that
and I'll pug ya.

502
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:25,201
- Hold it.

503
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,668
Let it drop here.

504
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:29,168
- Alright but the dead
weight stays behind, see?

505
00:53:29,169 --> 00:53:31,668
- That's right, you
should leave her here.

506
00:53:31,669 --> 00:53:33,168
She's no use to us anymore.

507
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:34,734
- I'll deal out the orders.

508
00:53:34,735 --> 00:53:35,835
- Since when?

509
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:45,902
- Just figure the gun
power gives him the edge.

510
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:20,069
(suspenseful music)

511
00:54:46,735 --> 00:54:47,735
Stop it!

512
00:54:55,902 --> 00:54:59,568
Are you trying to
kill each other?

513
00:54:59,569 --> 00:55:00,569
Hold it!

514
00:55:09,635 --> 00:55:11,469
- [Joe] I'll kill you.

515
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:17,069
- Did you hear me?

516
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:22,701
Cut it out!

517
00:55:22,702 --> 00:55:24,202
You've gone crazy!

518
00:55:25,335 --> 00:55:27,834
Keep your head, idiot,
or we'll all die.

519
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:29,801
- I intend to kill him
the first chance I get.

520
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:32,202
He got the Weasel, didn't he?

521
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:03,401
We should be at
the railway tracks.

522
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:06,468
If you ask me, we're as lost
as a blind man in the city.

523
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,301
We've been going
around in circles for

524
00:56:08,302 --> 00:56:09,901
a couple hours at least.

525
00:56:09,902 --> 00:56:12,068
- The only way is this one.

526
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:15,868
And if we don't all
die of thirst, we'll
get there tomorrow.

527
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:17,868
- Just how often do
the trains pass here?

528
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:19,435
- Don't worry, boy.

529
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:22,401
There's bound to
be more than one.

530
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:25,902
(moody atmospheric music)

531
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:42,435
- I'm not gonna make it.

532
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,368
- The rail.

533
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:48,369
There.

534
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:58,369
- Gotta get to the tunnel
before a train passes through.

535
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:04,468
- I rode that train

536
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:07,534
when I could stretch my
legs like a free man does.

537
00:57:07,535 --> 00:57:09,802
- You got a damn good idea.

538
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:12,501
We'll all soon be free.

539
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:15,101
- When that brakeman sees
us he'll stop the train.

540
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,668
- Don't worry about it.

541
00:57:16,669 --> 00:57:19,934
In that dark tunnel,
nobody could see us.

542
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:22,301
- We'll just be separated,
that's all, free, no.

543
00:57:22,302 --> 00:57:24,301
We'll never be completely free.

544
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,101
- I'm planning on it.

545
00:57:26,102 --> 00:57:28,634
We'll make it to the
farm and that's it.

546
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:32,434
- Gold will wind up
choking us to death.

547
00:57:32,435 --> 00:57:34,701
You always feels
like a slave to it.

548
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,635
- A rich slave, though.

549
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:41,935
- There'll be chains for
men damned to hell like us.

550
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:51,369
- Wait for us here.

551
00:58:32,202 --> 00:58:35,369
(faint train whistle)

552
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:44,335
(faint train whistle)

553
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:55,501
- Hope the wheels don't
slip on the chains.

554
00:58:55,502 --> 00:58:57,335
Could drag us with it.

555
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:04,469
(train whistle blows loudly)

556
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:19,235
(clacking train track)

557
00:59:21,669 --> 00:59:25,402
(train whistle blows loudly)

558
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:32,002
(clacking train track)

559
00:59:53,735 --> 00:59:57,902
(gun fires)
(train whistle blows loudly)

560
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:08,402
(dramatic music)
(men laugh)

561
01:00:21,302 --> 01:00:22,302
We're free.

562
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:40,635
(men laugh and cheer)

563
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:54,435
(Cathy sobs)

564
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:13,634
- Will you look at our
romantic lover and his woman.

565
01:01:13,635 --> 01:01:14,635
A bad bet.

566
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:17,968
He'll never get
her off his back.

567
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:21,302
- Well I'll help when
I slit his throat.

568
01:01:22,669 --> 01:01:24,734
- Cathy, you think
we're all alike?

569
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:27,734
(somber music)

570
01:01:27,735 --> 01:01:29,569
- Why do you ask that?

571
01:01:30,702 --> 01:01:34,001
- Ray was asking
why you followed us.

572
01:01:34,002 --> 01:01:36,735
Well I thought
you did it for me.

573
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:42,868
- I don't know why I do it.

574
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:46,802
Could be for you, or
because I hate the others.

575
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:54,468
There are times I think it
would be better if I would die.

576
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:55,869
I'm all confused.

577
01:01:57,502 --> 01:01:58,502
And tired.

578
01:01:59,435 --> 01:02:01,634
- It'll change before long.

579
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,468
It's just about
over and done with.

580
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:07,069
- Where does it finish for you?

581
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:10,535
- I'm not sure.

582
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,534
That gold darn near
cost us our lives.

583
01:02:16,535 --> 01:02:19,368
Hope it takes care
of us from now on.

584
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:22,469
- I thought you were
different, Dean.

585
01:02:23,435 --> 01:02:24,435
- I was.

586
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:28,769
Went to jail for a
robbery I didn't commit.

587
01:02:29,902 --> 01:02:32,301
And I figure I'm owed this gold.

588
01:02:32,302 --> 01:02:35,135
I've paid for it,
with my freedom.

589
01:02:39,935 --> 01:02:42,934
- This farm, how far
is now would you say?

590
01:02:42,935 --> 01:02:46,868
- Three days, if he doesn't
decide to go against us.

591
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:50,068
- I still think we better
stay clear of Fort Green.

592
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:53,101
- Well I didn't hear
anybody ask your opinion.

593
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,468
- It ain't right to
separate from us, Ray.

594
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:57,701
You might get killed
trying to make it.

595
01:02:57,702 --> 01:03:01,269
It sure would be a
shame to lose that gold.

596
01:03:28,602 --> 01:03:31,602
(suspenseful music)

597
01:03:43,135 --> 01:03:44,102
- Dirty rat.

598
01:03:44,102 --> 01:03:45,102
Hey!

599
01:03:46,335 --> 01:03:47,668
That rattlesnake marched
right out of here

600
01:03:47,669 --> 01:03:49,501
with all our provisions.

601
01:03:49,502 --> 01:03:50,768
- We better get him.

602
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:53,601
- Never be able to catch him.

603
01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:57,268
He escaped while
we were sleepin'.

604
01:03:57,269 --> 01:03:59,201
It's better to keep goin'.

605
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,934
- Without any food?

606
01:04:00,935 --> 01:04:03,534
Nah, we'll never make it.

607
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:04,535
- Hold it.

608
01:04:05,335 --> 01:04:07,935
(strong winds)

609
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:36,502
(suspenseful music)

610
01:04:49,335 --> 01:04:52,569
(Ray groans and gasps)

611
01:06:33,669 --> 01:06:36,235
(strong winds)

612
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:04,802
(suspenseful music)

613
01:07:09,102 --> 01:07:11,602
(Ray screams)

614
01:08:29,502 --> 01:08:32,102
(Ray whimpers)

615
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:35,635
(Ray whines)

616
01:08:37,002 --> 01:08:39,134
- Damn convict must
have got bit by a bug.

617
01:08:39,135 --> 01:08:40,635
- The man's crazy.

618
01:08:43,635 --> 01:08:45,334
- It's gold, Pa.

619
01:08:45,335 --> 01:08:47,334
The Sergeant was right.

620
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:49,269
They really tricked us.

621
01:08:56,102 --> 01:08:57,302
- Give it here!

622
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:03,335
There ain't no one
tricks old man Buddy.

623
01:09:04,702 --> 01:09:05,702
Get up!

624
01:09:10,769 --> 01:09:13,668
Son, when I saw you boys
chained in the wagon,

625
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:15,402
my heart bled for ya.

626
01:09:17,602 --> 01:09:19,869
Where are your friends now?

627
01:09:21,169 --> 01:09:22,601
- You better answer!

628
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:23,668
(thud)

629
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:24,934
- That's not the way, my son.

630
01:09:24,935 --> 01:09:27,602
You don't treat a man like that.

631
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,269
Alright, talk!

632
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:38,168
- They're at the farm.

633
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:39,501
The one near Fort Green.

634
01:09:39,502 --> 01:09:40,601
- You're lyin'!

635
01:09:40,602 --> 01:09:41,834
That place is crawlin'
with soldiers.

636
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:45,168
Why in tarnation
would they go there?

637
01:09:45,169 --> 01:09:49,335
- They need a wagon and to
take off their shackles.

638
01:09:50,702 --> 01:09:52,734
- You're in very good
luck, I'll see you get free

639
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:55,201
of yours without your needin'
to go all that distance.

640
01:09:55,202 --> 01:09:57,202
- Pa, can I pack him in?

641
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,501
- Mm-mm.

642
01:09:59,502 --> 01:10:00,502
No.

643
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:05,002
Not 'til we are damn
sure he tells the truth.

644
01:10:07,535 --> 01:10:11,401
- I'm wonderin' what'll
happen at the farm.

645
01:10:11,402 --> 01:10:13,168
- Well, Dean could
try murderin' us

646
01:10:13,169 --> 01:10:15,101
the way he did to Weasel.

647
01:10:15,102 --> 01:10:19,001
- I might.
- Or I could get him first.

648
01:10:19,002 --> 01:10:22,702
Or we could kill each
other off for the gold.

649
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:27,768
Or we could start acting
like smart human beings and

650
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:30,101
try to help each
other to survive.

651
01:10:30,102 --> 01:10:31,102
- Yeah.

652
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:36,268
Unless we find something
nobody's looking for.

653
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:38,435
Life is full of surprises.

654
01:10:44,935 --> 01:10:47,935
(melancholic music)

655
01:10:52,035 --> 01:10:55,169
Why don't you come
close to the fire?

656
01:10:57,502 --> 01:11:00,134
All of us have gone
through dreadful things.

657
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:02,234
But like it or not, (chuckles)

658
01:11:02,235 --> 01:11:05,568
life is the only thing we have.

659
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:07,435
- It's not much, is it?

660
01:11:08,902 --> 01:11:12,068
- This morning I could see
what you were about to do.

661
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:13,335
- You're wrong.

662
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:17,134
I'm only waiting to
see all of you dead.

663
01:11:17,135 --> 01:11:18,569
- Don't say that.

664
01:11:20,469 --> 01:11:22,135
You know how I feel.

665
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:26,801
- You've done a lot
of things, Dean,

666
01:11:26,802 --> 01:11:29,234
but don't lie to yourself.

667
01:11:29,235 --> 01:11:32,734
In me you saw only the
possibility of a way out.

668
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:33,735
- Yes.

669
01:11:35,602 --> 01:11:37,435
At the beginning, yes.

670
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:42,102
- And now it's too
late for us all.

671
01:11:44,502 --> 01:11:47,901
- Hop to it, sons, we got a
rough trip to Fort Green, boys!

672
01:11:47,902 --> 01:11:51,002
We'll never get
there dilly-dallyin'.

673
01:11:55,569 --> 01:11:56,769
Get goin', you!

674
01:12:14,469 --> 01:12:16,034
- Better move it, Pa.

675
01:12:16,035 --> 01:12:18,501
We gotta grab 'em before
they get to that farm.

676
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:22,068
- If we overwork the horses,
son, we'll never get there.

677
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:25,069
(suspenseful music)

678
01:12:58,202 --> 01:13:00,135
(clack)

679
01:13:02,102 --> 01:13:06,234
(gun fires)
(groans)

680
01:13:06,235 --> 01:13:09,134
(gun fires)
(groans)

681
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,368
(gun fires)

682
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:12,469
(groans)

683
01:13:37,202 --> 01:13:40,202
(suspenseful music)

684
01:14:35,169 --> 01:14:37,668
- [Joe] Well, there it is.

685
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:39,934
- Guess we'd better
wait 'til it gets dark.

686
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:42,534
- Do you think Caldwell
will recognize us?

687
01:14:42,535 --> 01:14:46,535
- Your mother wouldn't
be able to recognize you.

688
01:14:51,469 --> 01:14:54,469
(suspenseful music)

689
01:15:09,169 --> 01:15:10,235
Good evenin'.

690
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:13,168
- A bottle of whisky.

691
01:15:13,169 --> 01:15:15,001
- Cost ya $2.

692
01:15:15,002 --> 01:15:17,335
- Nobody asked you the cost.

693
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:32,169
- You playin' cards or not?

694
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:38,369
(suspenseful music)

695
01:16:23,402 --> 01:16:25,234
- Settle down, Caldwell.

696
01:16:25,235 --> 01:16:27,768
We'll pay for it all.

697
01:16:27,769 --> 01:16:29,501
- Where do I know you from?

698
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,134
- You and me had a
long friendly chat.

699
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:33,934
Long time ago.

700
01:16:33,935 --> 01:16:35,335
Don't you recall?

701
01:16:40,969 --> 01:16:42,301
- Got somethin' to eat?

702
01:16:42,302 --> 01:16:44,402
- No, it's much too late.

703
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:46,902
- Are you sure?

704
01:16:47,902 --> 01:16:49,102
Go take a look.

705
01:16:52,269 --> 01:16:55,435
(clanging piano keys)

706
01:16:58,635 --> 01:17:00,835
(whispers)

707
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:16,735
- You got any money?

708
01:17:18,535 --> 01:17:20,702
Caldwell wants to see you.

709
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:24,034
- [Joe] Is this enough?

710
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:25,734
(Thomas chuckles)

711
01:17:25,735 --> 01:17:28,734
- Maybe you ought
to look closer.

712
01:17:28,735 --> 01:17:29,835
They're gold.

713
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:42,468
- It's gold, alright, Serge.

714
01:17:42,469 --> 01:17:43,469
Pure gold.

715
01:17:47,302 --> 01:17:50,802
- Think it's enough
to pay for everything?

716
01:17:56,735 --> 01:17:58,634
- Bring us another bottle.

717
01:17:58,635 --> 01:17:59,768
- Where'd you get it?

718
01:17:59,769 --> 01:18:01,301
- None of your business.

719
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:05,301
Caldwell, we need a wagon
and six big strong horses.

720
01:18:05,302 --> 01:18:07,534
And we'll swap ya.

721
01:18:07,535 --> 01:18:10,534
A nice long piece
of this here chain.

722
01:18:10,535 --> 01:18:14,734
Can you see to it?
- Oh, no. (chuckles)

723
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:18,434
You fellas are gonna
accompany me to Fort Green.

724
01:18:18,435 --> 01:18:22,134
You're gonna come up with some
answers to some questions.

725
01:18:22,135 --> 01:18:24,568
- What for, Sergeant?

726
01:18:24,569 --> 01:18:26,402
We already been there.

727
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,769
It's a rotten cesspool.

728
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:42,402
- Come on, Sergeant.

729
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,869
Don't make things
complicated, huh?

730
01:18:49,135 --> 01:18:50,202
Have a cigar.

731
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,769
(Joe laughs)

732
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:19,102
- Didn't my friends
order a bottle?

733
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:25,201
Can you give us a
wagon, Caldwell?

734
01:19:25,202 --> 01:19:27,268
- I don't have any.
- You're lying.

735
01:19:27,269 --> 01:19:28,534
- I swear it.

736
01:19:28,535 --> 01:19:31,768
Why don't you search the place?

737
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:33,502
- You boys hear that?

738
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:37,601
- We'll have to
spend the night here.

739
01:19:37,602 --> 01:19:39,268
But about eight in
the morning the wagon

740
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:43,334
from Fort Green comes
to get provisions.

741
01:19:43,335 --> 01:19:44,601
True, Caldwell?

742
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:47,602
(Caldwell chuckles)

743
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:51,769
- Come on, boys,
have a drink with us.

744
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:54,468
Sergeant.

745
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:57,302
- [Sergeant] Yeah,
I'd be glad to.

746
01:19:59,602 --> 01:20:02,002
(Joe laughs)

747
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:15,535
♪ Oh my darlin', oh
my darlin' Clementine

748
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:19,968
- [Officer] Give
me a swig of that.

749
01:20:19,969 --> 01:20:22,802
(slurred singing)

750
01:20:25,202 --> 01:20:26,369
- It was true.

751
01:20:27,435 --> 01:20:29,502
The corral sure is empty.

752
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:36,835
- We'll just keep on waitin'.

753
01:20:38,702 --> 01:20:41,968
It's only two hours
before daybreak.

754
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:44,501
- [Joe] That's enough!

755
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:47,435
(officers grumble)

756
01:20:51,102 --> 01:20:53,269
- What about the soldiers?

757
01:20:54,435 --> 01:20:57,001
- Get rid of 'em. (chuckles)

758
01:20:57,002 --> 01:21:00,201
What else can we do with them?

759
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:01,834
- We're not even
crossing the border yet,

760
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:04,168
gotta get rid of the army.

761
01:21:04,169 --> 01:21:07,168
Let's tie them up and
leave them in the corral.

762
01:21:07,169 --> 01:21:10,901
By the time they're found,
we'll all be on the other side.

763
01:21:10,902 --> 01:21:12,668
- Alright, soldier boys.

764
01:21:12,669 --> 01:21:14,501
Time to get a little sleep.

765
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,768
(officers grumble)

766
01:21:16,769 --> 01:21:18,168
(slurred singing)

767
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:20,202
- Oh, there's still time.

768
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,768
- Oh, the party's just
about to get started!

769
01:21:23,769 --> 01:21:25,668
- You heard me!

770
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:26,669
Get out!

771
01:21:28,435 --> 01:21:29,435
Out.

772
01:21:30,669 --> 01:21:33,335
- [Sergeant] Alright, I'm goin'.

773
01:21:36,569 --> 01:21:39,434
♪ Oh my darlin'

774
01:21:39,435 --> 01:21:42,368
♪ Oh my darlin'
- Move it!

775
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:45,935
♪ Oh my darling Clementine

776
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:57,902
- What about a toast, to
our forthcoming separation?

777
01:22:05,069 --> 01:22:06,969
What do you plan to do?

778
01:22:13,069 --> 01:22:16,001
- To tell the
truth, I don't know.

779
01:22:16,002 --> 01:22:17,901
- [Thomas] Is she
going with you?

780
01:22:17,902 --> 01:22:18,902
- Yes.

781
01:22:18,903 --> 01:22:21,234
(Thomas chuckles)

782
01:22:21,235 --> 01:22:23,102
- I think you're wrong.

783
01:22:33,735 --> 01:22:35,402
- Not your business.

784
01:22:50,802 --> 01:22:53,402
(clock chimes)

785
01:23:00,069 --> 01:23:02,368
- I guess you forgot, Caldwell.

786
01:23:02,369 --> 01:23:05,868
But you and I have to
settle up an old account.

787
01:23:05,869 --> 01:23:08,468
(chuckles)

788
01:23:08,469 --> 01:23:12,468
Three years ago I passed by
here and wanted a bottle of gin.

789
01:23:12,469 --> 01:23:15,135
I laid $5 on top of the counter.

790
01:23:17,302 --> 01:23:18,368
- Let it lie.

791
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,969
(Joe chuckles)

792
01:23:22,402 --> 01:23:24,001
- I'm bored!

793
01:23:24,002 --> 01:23:28,069
And what's wrong with
talkin' with an old friend?

794
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:33,668
And you and I are
friends, eh? (chuckles)

795
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:34,968
(suspenseful music)

796
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,468
Right, Caldwell?

797
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:37,734
- [Caldwell] Don't know
what you're talkin' about.

798
01:23:37,735 --> 01:23:39,734
- You took me up to Fort Green.

799
01:23:39,735 --> 01:23:41,735
You beginning to recall?

800
01:23:43,135 --> 01:23:46,801
You took the $5 and didn't
even give me the gin, friend.

801
01:23:46,802 --> 01:23:49,968
And then you said, "since
you're going to jail,

802
01:23:49,969 --> 01:23:51,534
"you won't be needing it."

803
01:23:51,535 --> 01:23:54,469
Well now I'm gonna
collect that $5!

804
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:58,535
(Caldwell groans)

805
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:03,969

806
01:24:07,269 --> 01:24:09,568

807
01:24:09,569 --> 01:24:10,734

808
01:24:10,735 --> 01:24:13,535

809
01:24:29,869 --> 01:24:32,702
(Caldwell groans)

810
01:24:46,535 --> 01:24:49,302
(soldiers snore)

811
01:24:55,102 --> 01:24:58,102
(door creaks open)

812
01:24:59,602 --> 01:25:00,834
- Sergeant.

813
01:25:00,835 --> 01:25:01,769
Sergeant!

814
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:02,834
Wake up!

815
01:25:02,835 --> 01:25:03,835
Wake up.

816
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:11,001
You've gotta notify Fort
Green to act and fast.

817
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:12,801
Please hurry up.

818
01:25:12,802 --> 01:25:14,135
There's no time.

819
01:25:15,869 --> 01:25:16,969
Please hurry.

820
01:25:20,535 --> 01:25:23,369
(Sergeant groans)

821
01:25:25,535 --> 01:25:29,602
(slaps)
(whines)

822
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:43,535
- I caught her trying
to free the soldiers.

823
01:26:02,335 --> 01:26:06,502
(grunts)
(groans)

824

826
01:26:35,102 --> 01:26:36,102
- No!

828
01:27:26,435 --> 01:27:28,602

829
01:28:13,535 --> 01:28:14,535
No!

831
01:28:24,669 --> 01:28:28,635

832
01:28:58,435 --> 01:29:01,735
(dissonant piano notes)

833
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:20,934
- They're out there, get ready.

834
01:29:20,935 --> 01:29:23,935
(suspenseful music)

835
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,469
