1
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,160
Through the snow and sleet and hail...

2
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,480
...through the blizzard, through the gale...

3
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,560
...through the wind and through the rain...

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,440
...over mountain, over plain...

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
...through the blinding lightning flash...

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,160
...and the mighty thunder crash...

7
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,280
...ever faithful, ever true...

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,560
...nothing stops him.

9
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
He'll get through.

10
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,280
# Look out for Mr. Stork
# That persevering chap

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,760
# He'll come along and drop
# A bundle in your lap

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
# You may be poor or rich
# It doesn't matter which

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,520
# Millionaires, they get theirs
# Like the butcher and the baker

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,000
# So look out for Mr. Stork
# And let me tell you, friend

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,960
# Don't try to get away
# He'll find you in the end

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
# He'll spot you out in China
# Or he'll fly to County Cork

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,440
# So you'd better look out
# For Mr. Stork

18
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,360
# Look out for Mr. Stork
# He's got you on his list

19
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,000
# And when he comes around
# It's useless to resist

20
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,520
# Remember those quintuplets
# And the woman in the shoe

21
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,840
# Maybe he's got his eye on you #

22
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
All aboard! All aboard!

23
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,120
All aboard! Let's go!

24
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,360
# Casey Junior's comin' down the track

25
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,160
# Comin' down the track
# With a smoky stack

26
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,880
# Hear him puffin'
# Comin' round the hill

27
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,640
# Casey's here to thrill
# Every Jack and Jill

28
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,760
# Every time his funny
# Little whistle sounds

29
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,960
# Everybody hurries to the circus grounds

30
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,600
# Time for lemonade and Cracker Jack

31
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,840
# Casey Junior's back
# Casey Junior's back #

32
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,520
Oh. My, my.

33
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,840
Now let me see.

34
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,960
Must be right around here somewhere.

35
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,280
I hope. Ah, watch it there.

36
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,760
# On the treetop

37
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,720
Where are we here? Oh, here.

38
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,320
# Highway 61, four miles to the gas station

39
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,000
# Turn left
# Da-da da-da-da de

40
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,520
Ah. That must be it.

41
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,600
Well, little fella, let's get goin'.

42
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Mrs. Jumbo. Oh, Mrs. Jumbo.

43
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,760
Calling Mrs. Jumbo.

44
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,680
Mrs. Jumbo?

45
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,200
Oh. My.

46
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,880
Mrs. Jumbo!

47
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
- Oh, where's that Mrs. Jum--
- Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

48
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,600
- Over here.
- This way, boy.

49
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
- In here! In here!
- Yoo-hoo!

50
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,960
- This is the place.
- Whew! At last.

51
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,200
Which one of you ladies is expecting?

52
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,080
- Hmph! Not me.
- The very idea.

53
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,840
Certainly not. Over there, of course.

54
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,120
Yes, of course. Right over there.

55
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,400
Oh. Of course.

56
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,680
Here is a baby with eyes of blue...

57
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,080
...straight from heaven right to you.

58
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,040
Or: Straight from heaven up above...

59
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,480
...here is a baby for you to love.

60
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,520
Sign here, please.

61
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,840
Uh, yeah. Well... Oh. Mrs. Jumbo.

62
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,960
Uh, one moment, please.
This is still part of the service.

63
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
# Happy Birthday to you

64
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
# Ah, Happy Birthday to you

65
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,600
# Ah, Happy Birthday, dear

66
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,640
Ah, dear... Dear me. What's his name?

67
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,600
Jumbo. Junior.

68
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
Oh. Jumbo Junior, huh?
Ahem. Jumbo Junior.

69
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
# Happy Birthday, dear Jumbo Junior

70
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,600
# Happy Birthday

71
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,120
# To-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

72
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,520
# You #

73
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,240
- Oh, do hurry, dear.
- I'm on pins and needles.

74
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,280
- Isn't it thrilling?
- I'm all a-flutter.

75
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,920
Ah, this is a proud, proud day.

76
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,000
- Well, hurry and open it, dearie.
- I'm just dying to see.

77
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,680
- Oh!
- Look at him!

78
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
Look at him!

79
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Oh, what a... Oh, look!

80
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,600
- Oh, you sweet little thing.
- He is cute, isn't he?

81
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,480
Oh, he is a darling little baby.

82
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,080
Adorable. Simply adorable.

83
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,120
Did you ever see anything so cunning?

84
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,240
Isn't he a darling!

85
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,360
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy,
kootchy, kootchy, kootchy.

86
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,400
- Oh!
- Oh!

87
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,480
- Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?

88
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,280
Just look at those, those--

89
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,000
E-A-R-S.

90
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
Those what? Oh, ears!

91
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,280
These! Aren't they funny? Oh!

92
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,720
- Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.

93
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,480
Oh, what did I do? Well, tell me.

94
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
- Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.

95
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,240
I just said that they're funny,
and they are funny.

96
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,440
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares...

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
...about her precious little Jumbo?

98
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,240
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.

99
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,360
Dumbo.

100
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,640
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.

101
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,720
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.

102
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,280
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

103
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,160
I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.

104
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,160
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.

105
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,080
Whoo-woo!

106
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,960
# Hike, ugh, hike, ugh, hike, ugh, hike

107
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
# We work all day, we work all night

108
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,960
# We never learned to read or write

109
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
# We're happy-hearted roustabouts

110

# Hike, ugh, hike, ugh, hike, ugh, hike

111
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,600
# When other folks have gone to bed

112
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,560
# We slave until we're almost dead

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
# We're happy-hearted roustabouts

114
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,920
# Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike

115
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
# We don't know when we get our pay

116
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
# And when we do we throw our pay away

117
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,360
# When we get our pay
# We throw our money all away

118
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,440
# We get our pay when children say

119
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
# With happy hearts
# It's circus day today

120
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,760
# Then we get our pay
# Just watching kids on circus day

121
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,760
# Muscles aching, back near breaking

122
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,360
# Eggs and bacon's what we need

123
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,240
- Yes, sir!
- # Boss man houndin'

124
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,280
# Keep on poundin'

125
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,040
# For your bread and keep

126
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,360
# There ain't no letup

127
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,480
# Got to set up

# Pull that canvas

# Oh #

144
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,400
Jostling and juggling. Fifteen minutes!

145
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,480
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.

146
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,560
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.

147
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,280
Fifteen big attractions that you
can't see anywhere else in the world!

148
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,680
The greatest collection in the entire world.

149
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,160
And the greatest comedies are featured
and assembled for your entertainment.

150
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
Ain't that the funniest thing
you ever saw? Look at his ears.

151
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,760
Hey, guys, lookit! Smitty's an elephant!

152
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,800
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!

153
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,520
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.

154
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,080
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!

155
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,960
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.

156
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,640
Hey, the biggest slingshot in the world.

157
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,800
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.

158
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,600
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?

159
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,640
Down. Mrs. Jumbo, down!

160
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,440
Surround her. Tie her down.

161
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,960
Get down!

162
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,840
Calm down! Tie her down!

163
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,600
Darling, it was so funny.

164
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,840
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

165
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,560
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

166
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,320
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.

167
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,720
After all, one mustn't forget
one is a lady.

168
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,400
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.

169
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,760
Oh, well, I suppose that's mother love.

170
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,120
But it's certainly no excuse
for what she did.

171
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,080
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

172
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,480
It's true, my dear,
and she has such a streak in--

173
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,480
A guy can't eat in peace.

174
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,440
Yes, but mother love does--

175
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,680
Gab, gab, gab. Always gossipin'.

176
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,040
Girls, girls! Listen!

177
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,400
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

178
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,240
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

179
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,760
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

180
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,760
- No!
- You don't mean it!

181
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,280
Oh, how awful for her!

182
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,000
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.

183
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,720
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...

184
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,720
F-R-E-A-K.

185
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,080
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

186
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,200
What's the matter with his ears?

187
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,280
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.

188
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,760
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.

189
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

190
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,440
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

191
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,800
His disgrace is our own shame.

192
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,800
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

193
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,360
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat
at the same bale of hay with him.

194
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,720
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

195
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,440
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

196
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,840
Here he comes now.

197
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,440
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

198
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,960
Shh.

199
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,560
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

200
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,800
Poor little guy.

201
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,000
There he goes, without a friend in the world.

202
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,720
Nobody to turn to.

203
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,760
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

204
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,440
A mouse!

205
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,360
So ya like to pick on little guys, huh?

206
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,960
Well, why don't you pick on me?

207
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,440
A proud race.

208
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,680
Overstuffed hay bags!

209
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
Boo!

210
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,440
Still afraid of a mouse.

211
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,600
Ho-ho, boy. Wait'll I tell the little guy.

212
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,320
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

213
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
You can come out now.

214
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,320
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

215
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,560
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

216
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,480
Come on out, won't ya?

217
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,400
You're not really afraid of little me, are ya?

218
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,240
Ya are? Must've overdid it in there.

219
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,920
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

220
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,800
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

221
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,600
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Ya gotta come out first.

222
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,680
Too bad ya don't trust me, 'cause I thought...

223
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,400
...uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

224
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,280
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

225
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,640
Well, that's more like it.

226
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,240
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

227
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,560
She's just broken-hearted.

228
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,320
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

229
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,560
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

230
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,400
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

231
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,280
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

232
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,120
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

233
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,360
Ho-ho, boy. All we gotta do is build an act.

234
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,400
Make ya a star. A headliner!

235
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,640
Dumbo the Great!

236
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,240
Uh-oh. The great what?

237
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,000
Ya know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.

238
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,840
Not just any idea. Something colossal, like, uh--

239
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
Have I got an idea! What an idea!

240
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,760
Huh. He never had an idea in his life.

241
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,960
Just visualize: One elephant climbs up...

242
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,160
...on top of another elephant until finally...

243
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,400
...all 17 elephants...

244
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,760
...have constructed an enormous pyramid...

245
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,840
...of pachyderms.

246
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,320
I step out.

247
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,240
I blow the whistle.

248
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,680
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

249
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,520
- Yeah.
- And now...

250
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,840
...comes the climax!

251
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,640
Yeah? What is the climax?

252
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
Hmm. I don't know.

253
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,400
I knew he never had nothin'.

254
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,280
Well, maybe it comes to me...

255
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,880
...in a vision while I dream.

256
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,280
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

257
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
Climax.

258
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,200
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

259
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,440
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

260
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,560
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.

261
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,040
Your inspiration.

262
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,560
Now, concentrate.

263
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,120
Remember? Your pyramid of elephants...

264
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,240
...are standing in the ring
waitin' for a climax.

265
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,040
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

266
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,000
- Climax.
- How's the reception?

267
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Comin' through okay? Good.

268
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,600
Suddenly, from the sidelines, comes your climax.

269
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,960
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.

270
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,360
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

271
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,840
...to a platform.

272
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,040
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid,
he waves a flag...

273
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,760
...for a glorious finish!

274
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,680
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?

275
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,560
The little elephant with the big ears!

276
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,840
The world's mightiest midget mastodon! Dumbo!

277
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
What?

278
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,240
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

279
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,480
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

280
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,680
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

281
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,680
I got it! I got it!

282
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,840
Ladies and gentlemen...

283
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
...we will now present for your entertainment...

284
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,480
...the most stupendous, magnificent...

285
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,760
...super-colossal spectacle.

286
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,080
On this tiny...

287
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,080
...little, insignificant ball...

288
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,280
...we will construct for you...

289
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
...a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...

290
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,080
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

291
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,880
- ...but a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

292
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,800
...pyramid of ponderous, pulsating...

293
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,120
...pulchritudinous pachyderms!

294
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,360
I give you the elephants.

295
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,600
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

296
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,480
Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?

297
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,800
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.

298
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,800
Quiet up there. Tend to your work, girls.

299
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,840
Take your foot out of my eye, clumsy ox.

300
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,520
Steady, girls.

301
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,880
Boy, that was a close one.

302
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,320
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

303
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Okay, okay. Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.

304
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,840
Now, look. All ya gotta do is run out, see?

305
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,840
Jump on the springboard.

306
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,600
All right, now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

307
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,640
That's it. Attaboy. That's the stuff. Come on.

308
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!

309
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,560
Oh, those ears. We gotta do somethin', quick.

310
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
Ladies and gentlemen...

311
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,760
...you have now seen the impossible...

312
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,160
...accomplished in front of your faces.

313
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,760
Seven jungle giants...

314
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,680
...each one weighing not--

315
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,280
That windbag!

316
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,120
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!

317
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,360
And now, I present...

318
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,560
...the world's smallest little elephant...

319
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,440
...who will spring from this springboard...

320
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,520
...in one spring...

321
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,440
...to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

322
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,680
...for a grand climax!

323
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,120
Ladies and gentlemen...

324
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,360
...I give you Dumbo!

325
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,960
Go on! Get goin'!

326
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,160
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!

327
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,200
You're on, Dumbo.

328
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,840
Out of my way, assassin!

329
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
- Dear!
- Ohh.

330
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,760
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

331
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,320
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

332
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,520
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!

333
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,040
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him--

334
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,880
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.

335
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.

336
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,440
They fixed him good.

337
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,360
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

338
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,040
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

339
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,560
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

340
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,640
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him--

341
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,480
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!

342
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,280
Made him a clown.

343
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,200
A clown?

344
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,960
- No!
- Yes.

345
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,600
Oh, the shame of it.

346
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,040
Let us take the solemn vow.

347
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,640
From now on, he is no longer...

348
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,560
...an elephant.

349
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,280
Please! Help me save my poor baby!

350
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,000
Whoo! Save my child!

351
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Where are you? Yoo-hoo!

352
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,400
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

353
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,640
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,440

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,400

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,800

358
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,880
Whew! Boy, oh, boy, did we wow 'em out there!

359
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,800
- What a performance!
- Are we good?

360
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
Thirteen curtain calls. Thirteen!

361
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,520
Yeah, sure brought down the house, all right.

362
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,600
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.

363
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,560
You said it. We rolled 'em in the aisles.

364
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,840
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.

365
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,440
Stupendous, I calls it.

366
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,320
They'll have more respect for us clowns now.

367
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,400
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

368
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,960
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

369
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,080
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

370
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,000
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

371
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,320
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.

372
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,920
See? They're drinkin' a toast to ya.

373
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,120
Yeah. You're a big hit.

374
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Why, uh, you're terrific.

375
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

376
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,960
Come on. Alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.

377
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,040
You oughta be proud.

378
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
You're a success.

379
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,320
Look. A peanut!

380
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,120
Come on. Eat it. Got lots of vitamins.

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,000

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh-ho-ho. I forgot to tell ya.

383
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,920
Why, we're goin' over to see your mother.

00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,120
I made an appointment for ya.
Didn't I tell ya? Huh!

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,200
Just like me. I must have forgot.

00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,680
Oh. Right over there.

387
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,800
Cosy little place, ain't it?

388
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,600
Mrs. Jumbo. I hope she's in.

389
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,440
Someone to see ya.

390
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,240
# Baby mine

391
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,600
# Don't you cry

392
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,560
# Baby mine

393
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,120
# Dry your eyes

394
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,680
# Rest your head

395
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,760
# Close to my heart

396
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,000
# Never to part

397
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,720
# Baby of mine

398
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,000
# Little one

399
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,040
# When you play

400
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,960
# Don't you mind

401
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,080
# What they say

402
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
# Let those eyes

403
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,640
# Sparkle and shine

404
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,040
# Never a tear

405
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,400
# Baby of mine

406
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,200
# From your head

407
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,000
# To your toes

408
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,960
# Baby mine

409
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,760
# You're so sweet
# Goodness knows

410
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,960
# Baby mine

411
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,640
- # You are so

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
- # Precious to me

00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,040
# Cute as can be
# Baby of mine

414
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
# Baby mine

415
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,760
# Baby mine #

416
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,400
Here ya are. Pour it in me slipper, Joey.

417
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,360
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

418
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,400
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

419
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,840
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

420
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,400
Yeah! If they laugh when he jumps 20 feet...

421
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,160
...they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

422
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,160
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

423
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,680
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

424
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,600
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

425
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,320
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

426
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,280
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

427
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,120
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

428
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,880
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

429
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,320
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

430
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,160
Hey, hey! Let's hit him for a raise.

431
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,400
Yeah, sure. This is worth real dough.

432
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,960
# Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise

433
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,480
# Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise

434
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,320
# Oh, we're gonna get more money
# 'cause we know that we're funny

435
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,480
# We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise #

436
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,320
I know how ya feel, Dumbo,
but you gotta pull yourself together.

437
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,200
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

438
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,920
Remember, you come of a proud race.

439
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,560
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm...

440
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,480
...and pachyderms don't cry.

441
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,520
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

442
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,520
There. Ya see?

443
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Well, ain't nothin'
a little water won't cure.

444
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,400
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya
fixed up in a jiffy.

445
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,280
Come on.

446
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Here. Take a trunk full.

447
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,680
Listen, little fella.

448
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,400
We may have had a lot
of hard luck up till now...

449
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,600
...but you and me is gonna do
big things together.

450
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,400
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's
gonna be so proud of ya.

451
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,040
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.

452
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,120
The whole circus is gonna be proud
of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

453
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,160
Swallow it.

454
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,600
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

455
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,080
Oh, I guess you had one little one left over.

456
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,440
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha--

457
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,320
Hey, what's the matter with you?

458
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,800
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

459
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,560
Balloonies.

460
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,600
Hiya, George.

461
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,640
Whee!

462
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
That's a pretty schstrick schlick.

463
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,000
All right. Let's see ya
blow a square one, pal.

464
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,840
Say, that's very, very clever.

465
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,400
Now blow a great big one.

466
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,440
That's a pretty sh... Hey!

467
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,040
Dumbo.

468
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,520
You see what I see?

469
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,080
# Look out, look out
# Pink elephants on parade

470
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,480
# Here they come
# Hippity-hoppity

471
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,520
# They're here and there
# Pink elephants everywhere

472
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,720
# Look out, look out

473
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,560
# They're walking around the bed
# On their head

474
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,440
# Clippity-cloppity
# Arrayed in braid

475
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,800
# Pink elephants on parade

476
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,800
- # What'll I do
- # What'll I do

477
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,040
# What an unusual view

478
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,880
# I can stand the sight of worms
# And look at microscopic germs

479
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,240
# But technicolour pachyderms
# Is really too much for me

480
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,160
# I am not the type to faint

481
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,200
# When things are odd
# Or things are quaint

482
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,240
# But seein' things
# You know there ain't

483
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,720
# Can certainly give you
# An awful fright

484
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,680
# What a sight
# Chase 'em away, chase 'em away

485
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,400
# I'm afraid, need your aid
# Pink elephants on parade

486
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,800
- # Hey, hey, hey
- # Pink elephants

487
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,880
# Pink elephants

488
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,800
# Pink elephants #

489
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,120
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

490
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,040
Why, this is most irregular.

491
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,600
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

492
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,360
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

493
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,640
Or do they?

494
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,120
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus? Come on.

495
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,160
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

496
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,240
What's the good news? What's fryin', boy?

497
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,080
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

498
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,480
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

499
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,600
Yeah. Find out what they're doin' up here.

500
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,680
- Yeah.
- And "axe" them what they want.

501
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,040
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

502
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,120
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

503
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,000
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

504
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,360
What's so funny? What are you boys
doin' down here, anyway?

505
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,520
What are we doin' down here?

506
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,440
Well, hear him talk.

507
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,400
Go on. Fly up a tree where you belong.

508
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,640
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

509
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,880
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

510
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,560
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

511
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,280
...and no elephant ain't
up in no tree, either.

512
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,760
No! No, me and no tree ain't up no... Huh?

513
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,840
Tree?

514
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,360
Yo!

515
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,920
Dumbo.

516
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,480
Dumbo. Wake up.

517
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,360
Wake up, Dumbo!

518
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,880
Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.

519
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,440
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

520
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,560
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

521
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,560
So long, boy!

522
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,440
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree, anyway.

523
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,880
Now, let's see.

524
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,400
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?

525
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,920
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

526
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,920
Couldn't jump up. Mm-mm. It's too high.

527
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,480
Hey there, son. Maybe you all flew up.

528
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,280
Maybe we flew up. Yeah, maybe we--

529
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,320
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

530
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,880
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

531
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,200
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.

532
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,720
The very things that held ya down
are gonna carry ya up and up and up!

533
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,960
I can see it all now.

534
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,520
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder of the Universe!

535
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,760
The world's only flyin' elephant!

536
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,560
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

537
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,080
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

538
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,280
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!

539
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,960
See, I've seen all that too.

540
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,520
# I've seen a peanut stand
# And heard a rubber band

541
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,400
# I seen a needle that winked its eye

542
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,760
# But I be done seen about ever'thing

543
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,960
# When I see a elephant fly

544
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,680
- What'd you say, boy?
- # I said when I see a elephant fly

545
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,080
# I seen a front porch swing
# Heard a diamond ring

546
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,840
# I seen a polka-dot railroad tie

547
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,440
# But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

548
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,640
# When I see a elephant fly

549
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,520
- # Da da-da-da
- # Da-da-da do-do-dow wow

550
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,360
- # Da da-da-da
- # Hey, wow

551
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,960
# I saw a clotheshorse
# He rear up and buck

552
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,200
# And they tell me that a man
# Made a vegetable truck

553
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,080
# I didn't see that I only heard

554
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,720
# Just to be sociable I'll take your word

555
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,840
- # I heard a fireside chat
- # I saw a baseball bat

556
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,760
# And I just laughed till I thought I'd die

557
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,360
# But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

558
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,440
# When I see a elephant fly

559
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,800
# Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do

560
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,720
# But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

561
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,960
# When I see a elephant fly

562
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,040
With the wind.

563
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,480
# When I see a elephant

564
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,040
# Fly #

565
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,680
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

566
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,640
Quiet, gentlemen.

567
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,240
The Reverend Rodent is gonna address you.

568
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,400
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

569
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,680
A bunch of big guys like you...

570
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,880
...pickin' on a poor little orphan like him.

571
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,040
Suppose you was torn away from
your mother when you was just a baby...

572
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,440
...nobody to tuck you in at nights...

573
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,240
...no warm, soft, caressin' trunk
to snuzzle into.

574
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,520
How would you like to be left out alone...

575
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,840
...in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

576
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,040
And why? I ask ya, why?

577
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,000
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

578
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,120
The laughing stock of the circus.

579
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,680
Then when his mother tried to protect him...

580
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,040
...they threw her into the clink.

581
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,760
And on top of that, they made him a clown!

582
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,640
Socially, he's washed up.

583
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,720
Ah, but what's the use of talkin'
to you cold-hearted birds?

584
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,880
Go ahead. Have your fun.

585
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,920
Laugh at him. Kick him, now that he's down.

586
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,320
Go on!

587
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,320
We don't care.

588
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,000
Come on, Dumbo.

589
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,400
Hey, brother, w-w-wait a minute.

590
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,960
Uh, don't go away feelin' like that.

591
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,200
We done seen the light.

592
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,120
You boys is okay.

593
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,320
Please, you've done enough.

594
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,520
Well, but we's all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

595
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,760
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.

596
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,640
You wanna make the elephant fly, don't ya?

597
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,000
Well, you gotta use a lot of 'chology.
You know, psychology.

598
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,040
Now, here's what you do. First, you, uh--

599
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,960
Uh, bu--

600
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,840
And then, right after that, you, uh--

601
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,920
Use the magic feather. Catch on?

602
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,480
The magic feather?

603
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,440
Yeah, I gotcha.

604
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,960
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!

605
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,840
The magic feather! Now you can fly!

606
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,320
Let's go. Let's go.

607
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,720
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

608
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,920
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.

609
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,840
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.

610
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,040
- One, two. One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

611
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,320
Faster, faster. Get up flyin' speed.

612
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,720
Retract your landing gear. Raise your fuselage.

613
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,640
Take off.

614
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,560
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

615
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,000
I guess it's just
another one of their... Look!

616
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,680
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.

617
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,640
You're flyin'!

618
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,520
Uh, why, he flies just like a eagle.

619
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,800
That's better than a aeroplane.

620
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,240
Brother, now I've seen everything.

621
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,520
# But I be done seen about everything

622
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,840
# When I see a elephant fly

623
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,880
With the wind.

624
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,840
# When I see a elephant

625
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,440
# Fly #

626
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,000
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!

627
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,480
Wait'll we get to the big town.

628
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,920
Boy, them city folks is sure in for a surprise.

629
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,040

Look at that house. Dumbo,...

634
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,080
...you're standing on the threshold of success.

635
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,520
Don't look down. It'll make you dizzy.

636
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,080
Boy, are they in for a surprise. Ho-ho.

637
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,080
Got the magic feather? Good.

Okay. Contact!

639
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,360
Take off!

640
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,800
Uh-oh. The magic feather!

641
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,320
Dumbo, come on. Fly. Open them ears.

642
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,280
The magic feather was just a gag. You can fly.

643
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,280
Honest, you can. Hurry! Open 'em up!

644
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,120

Let's show 'em, Dumbo. Power dive.

647
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,360
Now, loop the loop.

648
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,600
You're makin' history!

649
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,480
# I've seen a peanut stand
# Heard a rubber band

650
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,840
# I've seen a needle that winked its eye

01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,040
# When I see a elephant fly #

660
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,240
I wish I'd have got his autograph.

661
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh, man, I got his autograph.

662
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,320
Well, so long, glamour boy!
