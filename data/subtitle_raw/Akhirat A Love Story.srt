1
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,000
Tar, you've been silent since we met.
What's up with you?

2
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:37,875
Boyfriend?

3
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,083
No… What are you doing these days?

4
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,458
Oh, that. Mostly drawing.

5
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,791
What? Just drawing?

6
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,791
No. My lovely cousin is just being humble.

7
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,875
She is secretly making
an illustration book, guys.

8
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:54,833
Reva, no!

9
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,833
Look at the first page.
See what's behind it as well.

10
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,583
Oh, my. Honestly, I'm speechless.

11
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,250
-That looks great!
-That's so great!

12
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,458
It's great, don't hide it.
Just look at it.

13
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,250
That's so cute! Is it about a couple?

14
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,458
Is this about you? Wait, there's a guy.

15
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,625
Who's this guy?

16
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,125
Tim!

17
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,875
-I invited Timur too. Is that okay?
-Timur who?

18
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,291
Timur, our classmate, Rev.
How could you forget?

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
-Hello, everyone.
-Hey, Tim.

20
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,250
You're Rumit, right? Of course!

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,125
Rumit who?

22
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,500
He was my high school hero, babe.

23
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,083
Why is that?

24
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,791
Because he used to let me copy his work.

25
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,041
Right, Rumit? Thank you so much.

26
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,416
Rev, why do you call him "Rumit"?

27
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,208
If you spell Timur backwards,
it becomes "Rumit," right?

28
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:04,458
-Okay, I get it.
-Whatever she says.

29
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,458
Anyway, after we're done here,
don't go straight home.

30
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's go for some karaoke.

31
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,541
You like it, right?

32
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,666
-I'm so in!
-As always.

33
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,583
Tar, karaoke, okay?

34
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,416
-What? After this?
-Yes, after this.

35
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,458
-I can't. I have an appointment.
-You're such a busy person.

36
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,125
-Tim, can you join us?
-Sorry, I can't too.

37
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:30,208
Excuses, excuses… Let's just go
for karaoke and see how it goes.

38
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,416
Let's watch the movie next time, okay?

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,833
Reva was talking too much.

40
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,833
It's okay. There will be a next time.

41
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,666
TICKETS

42
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,041
Do you want to watch this one instead?

43
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,416
No.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,583
-We still can watch this.
-No way.

45
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,500
No?

46
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,833
Anyway, it's been a while
since we came here.

47
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,041
-Really?
-Let's just stay here.

48
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,666
Okay.

49
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,458
Isn't this the table
where we had our first conversation?

50
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,083
Isn't it that one?

51
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,708
No, this one.

52
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,916
I remember you were wearing a blue shirt,

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
and your hair looked so shiny,
too much hair wax maybe,

54
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,500
and it was combed backwards.

55
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,375
And then I approached you.

56
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,375
That's right!

57
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,416
And you realized that
we went to the same high school.

58
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,333
What if that was just me teasing you?

59
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,041
Oh, so you used to stalk me?

60
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,000
No. Reva told me.

61
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,375
I was just wondering,

62
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,833
the smartest kid in his class,
the teacher's pet,

63
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,291
suddenly becomes a volunteer
at the open-air cinema.

64
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,583
So it's true then. If Reva knows…

65
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,666
-the whole planet knows!
-The whole planet knows!

66
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,791
But that's cool.

67
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,708
I'm glad that Reva told you.

68
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,291
If she didn't, how could I have met you?

69
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,166
Even though you moved
to Australia afterwards,

70
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,791
and then started dating…
What's his name again?

71
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,541
-Tim, let's drop this topic!
-Oh!

72
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,250
Was it Nanda? The heir of an oil tycoon.

73
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,750
A perfect son-in-law for your mom.

74
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,750
But you're a million times better, Tim.

75
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,875
What matters now
is that I'm happy with you.

76
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,250
Are you happy with me?

77
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,666
About our parents…

78
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,416
I'll find a way to talk to them later.

79
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,458
But let's not rush it.

80
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,916
-Let's go home now.
-Okay.

81
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,125
-But let me pray first.
-Okay.

82
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,458
-Let's pray together.
-Sorry, I'm not Muslim.

83
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,416
I see.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
LEAVE YOUR FOOTWEAR HERE

85
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,958
RESTAURANT PADANG JAYA
OPEN

86
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,500
<i>I'm surprised you're not looking
for me today, Ms. Illustrator.</i>

87
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:21,083
<i>Ms. Illustrator Girl?
Sorry, Mr. Accountant.</i>

88
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,666
<i>-I'm busy organizing the anniversary…</i>
-Tar…

89
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,458
put down your phone.

90
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,750
Dad…

91
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,625
Can I have a little bit?

92
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,083
Okay, this is the last time.

93
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,583
Hello. What's up, Roy?

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,583
Roy, I'm having lunch with my family.
I'll call you later.

95
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,541
Okay, cool. Bye.

96
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,833
Mom, do we really have
to go to Nanda's wedding?

97
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,458
Of course, we have to.

98
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,000
Nanda's family invited us.
It won't look good if we don't.

99
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,250
Don't you want to see the Grand Mosque?

100
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,250
Not everyone can get in, you know?

101
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:33,083
Even though I'm sure Nanda just wants
to show what you could have had

102
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,083
if you didn't break up with him.

103
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,416
You really have to say that, Mom?

104
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,416
Just kidding.

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,625
No need to pout like that,
or your face will age faster.

106
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,125
I'm going to the toilet.

107
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,708
Watch my bag.

108
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,166
<i>I'm busy organizing
my parent's anniversary party</i>

109
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,291
<i>the day after tomorrow.</i>

110
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,541
<i>I'm about to meet the event organizer.</i>

111
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,458
Yes, Roy?

112
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,458
<i>Miss me?</i>

113
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,333
<i>Well… a little bit.</i>

114
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,208
<i>Really? Just a little bit?</i>

115
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
<i>You want to meet up tonight?</i>

116
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,958
-What are you looking for, Pete?
-The car keys.

117
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,250
Tim!

118
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,625
-Yes?
-Don't forget the microwave!

119
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,291
-Yes, Mom.
-Where is it?

120
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,750
Type 906.

121
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,666
It's not here.

122
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,291
I told you yesterday,
I put the keys in the marble jar.

123
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,291
When did you say that?

124
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,958
That's why you should listen
when someone is talking to you.

125
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,333
Tim, don't get the wrong microwave.

126
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:49,166
-This shipment is important. Okay?
-Yes, Mom. I'm about to take it.

127
00:10:55,416 --> 00:11:00,166
<i>Sure. I'll pick you up as usual
at the end of the street.</i>

128
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,083
<i>Okay. I'll tell Mom that
I'm going out with Reva.</i>

129
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,250
Ahem.

130
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,375
Bagus!

131
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,833
I thought we are going to meet an EO
for your anniversary party?

132
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,583
-Good afternoon.
-Bagus, have a seat.

133
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,083
Here.

134
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,833
I'm good.

135
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,750
Tar, do you remember Bagus?

136
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,416
Auntie Sari's son.

137
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,750
You used to play together
when you were a little.

138
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,666
Auntie, I'm so sorry for being late.

139
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,875
I forgot how bad Jakarta's traffic is.

140
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,125
-It's okay. Have you eaten?
-Yes, I have.

141
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,791
Huh?

142
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,791
What is this for?

143
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:05,375
I borrowed it from the church,
for our Bible study later at home.

144
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,750
Mom, you didn't give another discount
for the microwave, did you?

145
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,166
It was free.

146
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,041
Jeez.

147
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,250
Mom, how can we make money

148
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,333
if you just keep
giving them things for free?

149
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,166
But it's for the church in Kupang, Tim.

150
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,250
So I consider it a donation.

151
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,500
But you could have asked me first, Mom.

152
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,750
I have spent my time
taking care of your business finances.

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,583
I swear to God, we'll do better
selling this car to the junkyard!

154
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,458
Think about the business side too, Mom.

155
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,500
We can't survive like this.

156
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes, I know.

157
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,541
Finally!

158
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,500
Tim, have you brought
that wedding invitation inside?

159
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,291
The one from the head of the neighborhood.

160
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,666
Yes, it's on the dining table.

161
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,333
Did you know that his child
is two years younger than you?

162
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,583
Don't you want to find a girlfriend
at the church, Tim?

163
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,166
Pete!

164
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:24,000
Tar, Bagus just got
his master's degree from the US.

165
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,125
What are you up to these days, Bagus?

166
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,833
But I also run my own
fintech start-up company.

167
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,791
Isn't he great, Tar?

168
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,458
You're also single right, Gus?

169
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,625
What do you do?

170
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,375
I'm working on an illustration book.

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,208
Gus, Mentari's illustrations are great.

172
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,291
-Let's sit over there.
-Over there, right? Sounds great.

173
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,166
Selma?

174
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,541
-Oh, my god!
-Remember me?

175
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,625
Yes! We haven't seen each other
in such a long time!

176
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,125
How are you?
What's keeping you busy these days?

177
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,291
Well, I'm a member of the mosque council.

178
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,458
How about you, Selma?

179
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,333
I work from home, selling things online
with the help of my kids.

180
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,333
Sometimes, I volunteer at the church too.

181
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,750
Auntie Selma, how are you?

182
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:45,916
Wait… you went to the same school
as Timur, didn't you?

183
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,833
Remember her, Tim?

184
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,250
What? Yes.

185
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,625
Please enjoy your lunch,
sorry for interrupting.

186
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,583
-See you.
-See you.

187
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,250
See you.

188
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,625
Tim, what's her name?

189
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,625
All I remember is how annoying she was.

190
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,458
-Auntie Rahayu, Mom.
-Right.

191
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,791
{\an8}<i>I don't think so, Tim. Not a good idea.</i>

192
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,541
Why? Because my entire family is here.

193
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,666
Bagus?

194
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:43,583
Don't worry about him. He's just
a random guy my mom introduced me to.

195
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,541
Tim, I'm so sorry,
but I have to practice my speech.

196
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,666
Can we talk about this later?

197
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,291
Okay?

198
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,208
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,708
Ladies and gentlemen, aunties and uncles,

200
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,416
before we continue our dinner…

201
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:27,583
Dad and Mom, 25 years is not a short time.

202
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,458
Did you notice? For the past few months,

203
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:37,125
I‘ve kept you out of my painting studio.

204
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,458
But it is not without any reason.

205
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,916
I know this simple gift
will never be able to return

206
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,666
the love you have given me.

207
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,875
But hopefully, this painting can represent

208
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,708
the extraordinary commitment
between the two of you.

209
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,291
This painting is a symbol of love…

210
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,666
that… well…

211
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,791
both of you have given to our family.

212
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:29,500
Let's give a round of applause to Mentari
who seems to be a bit nervous tonight!

213
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,666
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
let's continue our dinner.

214
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,041
Are you crazy?

215
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,541
Tar…

216
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,833
I don't want to be…

217
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,458
just another random guy in your life.

218
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,291
Why didn't you tell me
that we need to change clothes?

219
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:27,500
-Hello, Uncle and Auntie.
-Hello.

220
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,166
Let me do it, Mom.

221
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,666
-It's quite heavy.
-Yes, it is.

222
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:11,041
I know I should have
introduced Timur to you earlier.

223
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,708
But what do you think, Mom?

224
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,291
Too tilted.

225
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,208
Can you shift it a little?

226
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,416
Yes. That's it.

227
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,125
I'm not talking about the painting, Mom.

228
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,166
Ah…

229
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,583
He seems nice.

230
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,458
What do you mean, Mom?

231
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,250
I'm not mad, Tar.

232
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,291
But, here's the thing.

233
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,291
You have to understand

234
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,166
that not everything in this world…

235
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,625
will suit you.

236
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,041
Can you fetch me that purple blouse?

237
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,750
From now on, you have to learn to choose…

238
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,500
which one suits you best,

239
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,833
and which one doesn't.

240
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,291
So, you think Timur isn't right for me?

241
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,416
You don't know him.

242
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,041
You haven't even talked to him.

243
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,166
Come, sit.

244
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,458
I know, I haven't talked to him.

245
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,333
But I know…

246
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,000
that you two have too many differences.

247
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,541
But that doesn't mean we're incompatible.

248
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,125
And it isn't always wrong.

249
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,375
You're not there yet,

250
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,791
but there will be a time
when you need someone to look up to.

251
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:30,833
Do you want to pray alone forever?

252
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:34,250
He will never be able to be your imam.

253
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,708
Are you sure?

254
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,916
So think about it carefully.

255
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,125
Okay?

256
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,791
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

257
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,583
-Amen.
-Amen.

258
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,416
-Let's eat now.
-Yes.

259
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,958
It's not much.

260
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,958
-We have some fruit punch. We have…
-…like to eat. You're usually the fastest!

261
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,750
-We have some fruit punch.
-I'm sure it will…

262
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,791
Here are the glasses.

263
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,041
Just open that.

264
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,041
What the hell, Pete!

265
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,750
I thought the Bible study was tomorrow.

266
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,375
I thought so too.

267
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,458
Mom said some couldn't make it tomorrow,
so they decided to do it today.

268
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Call Mentari, just tell her
to come some other time.

269
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,291
No way. She's already on her way.
I can't just tell her to go back now.

270
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,791
You're so dead.

271
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,791
Don't worry, Bro.
I'll make sure to be there…

272
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,916
at your funeral.

273
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,625
Get lost.

274
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,208
Ladies, the water is over here.

275
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,666
Thank you.

276
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,500
-Mom.
-What is it?

277
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,583
I want to introduce you to someone.

278
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:33,916
Who?

279
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,041
I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.

280
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,375
Why didn't you ever tell me? Who is she?

281
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,500
Mentari.

282
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,666
Auntie Rahayu's daughter.

283
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,750
You met her at the Padang restaurant,
remember?

284
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,666
I've invited her to come, Mom.

285
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,500
Will you meet her?

286
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,625
Tim, I think you're old enough

287
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,583
to think about your future seriously.

288
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:26,416
I know. That's why I asked her to come.

289
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:31,666
-Because I'm serious with Mentari.
-You know how her family is.

290
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,625
Their lifestyle.
They're different from us.

291
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:39,875
But Mom, you can at least
meet Mentari first.

292
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,291
I feel bad, Mom.

293
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,958
I'm sure that you will like her.

294
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,666
She's a nice girl.

295
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:53,541
Look, Tim.

296
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,041
Let me tell you something.

297
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,458
If you insist on keeping
this relationship,

298
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:04,791
trust me, you're just wasting your energy.

299
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't want you to be disappointed.

300
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,375
Do you understand what I mean?

301
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:44,875
So many people. Did you invite
your whole family to meet me?

302
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,916
-Peter!
-You're here, Mentari.

303
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,875
-Let me call Mom.
-Hey!

304
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,000
I have something for your mom.

305
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,375
Sorry if it's too simple.
I hope your mom likes it.

306
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,041
It's nice, Tar.

307
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,416
But, Tar, I told you the wrong schedule.

308
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,333
My mom is hosting a Bible study tonight.

309
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:22,583
I see.

310
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,083
But don't worry, we can find another time.

311
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:26,708
Is that okay?

312
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,333
But everything's fine, right?

313
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes, everything's fine.

314
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:40,791
Where's your car?

315
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,291
Did you drive here?

316
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,208
Yes.

317
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,791
I have an idea. You'll like it.

318
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,791
Pete, I'm going out.

319
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:58,000
Stay home with Mom.
Help her clean up when it's over.

320
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,291
-Okay?
-Yes, boss.

321
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,250
Let's go.

322
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:44,541
Now, tell me everything.

323
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,333
I've told you everything.

324
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,416
Are you sure?

325
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,333
What about your mom?

326
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,208
You know her.

327
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,958
What are you doing?

328
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,125
No one is picking up.

329
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,166
Congratulations,
your book is a bestseller!

330
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,250
You sold 10,000 copies.

331
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:53,250
That's not bad to cover
our wedding expenses.

332
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,541
What do you mean by that?

333
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:59,166
We will talk about it sooner or later.

334
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:12,833
Okay, what kind of wedding would you like?

335
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:22,791
I've always wanted to have
a simple wedding,

336
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,333
a private dinner…

337
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,833
in a garden

338
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,625
and we only invite our closest friends.

339
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:37,875
Everything has to be simple and…

340
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,708
What about the dress?

341
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,916
High neck top.

342
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,916
Floral brocade with a satin skirt.

343
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,125
Minimalist, but elegant.

344
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,583
It will be the prettiest wedding dress
I've ever seen.

345
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:16,916
Don't!

346
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,541
-Aren't you scared?
-Of a butterfly? Of course not.

347
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,666
Besides, my grandpa told me

348
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,666
that it might be the spirit
of an ancestor who's visiting.

349
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,000
Same!

350
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,583
-My mom also said the same thing.
-Really?

351
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,666
I guess our families
aren't so different after all.

352
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,416
Let's do it, Tar.

353
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:15,833
Let's do it all.

354
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What?

355
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:20,083
All of it.

356
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,083
Let's talk to my mom.

357
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,041
Okay. When?

358
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:30,666
Right now.

359
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,291
Finally, you're awake.

360
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,916
How was the crash? Was it hard?

361
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,125
Timur Nayoan, right?

362
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,875
You're the last one today.

363
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:55,875
And…

364
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,208
your status is still on hold.

365
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,291
So you can wait around here.

366
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:03,791
Who are you?

367
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,250
Where am I?

368
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,666
I'm Aria. You don't have to worry.

369
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,833
You are where you should be.

370
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:22,000
Just follow my instructions
and you'll be fine.

371
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,166
<i>Let's talk to my mom.</i>

372
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,791
If there's any status update,
I'll tell you…

373
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,250
I was with my girlfriend.

374
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:31,916
Where is she?

375
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:37,041
-Full name?
-Mentari Soenaryo.

376
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:46,791
She's not here.

377
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:52,500
Then where is she?

378
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,333
Sorry, I can't tell you that.

379
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,583
I am not authorized to…

380
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:58,666
Hey, where are you going?

381
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,291
Hey!

382
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,041
What is it?

383
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,625
Did you change your mind again, Wang?

384
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,833
It's not like that…

385
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:55,666
Well…

386
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,458
Wang, we can't be like this forever.

387
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,000
We've talked about this many times.

388
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,833
Okay, but you have to let me go.

389
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,583
I promise…

390
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,666
we will meet again.

391
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,125
Wang!

392
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,791
Hey!

393
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,916
I'd told you it's beyond my power.

394
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,833
-His name must be here!
-It's not here.

395
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,333
-Tar! Mentari!
-Timur!

396
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,250
-Timur!
-Hey!

397
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:44,958
Timur!

398
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,250
Tar…

399
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:53,250
-Tar, are you okay?
-Tim, I think something is wrong.

400
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,916
Hey, who are you? You can't be here.

401
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,083
Mr. Gotot! Catch him!

402
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,500
You catch him! Chase them!

403
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Here, Tar.

404
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,333
How could you lose them?

405
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,791
I'm sorry, Mr. Gotot.

406
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:27,541
What's his name?

407
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:29,791
Timur, Mr. Gotot.

408
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,666
Timur! Mentari!

409
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,208
Come out, kids.

410
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,958
Stop playing around, it's tiring!

411
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,291
If you come out now,
we can discuss it nicely.

412
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,375
Come on!

413
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,708
-Okay, sir.
-Good.

414
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:56,708
Let's have a good discussion.

415
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,291
Okay, good.

416
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,625
I just want to know…

417
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,708
why we're here and what place is this.

418
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,291
Don't worry.

419
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,875
This is just a transitory place
before you go to your final destination.

420
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,166
Then why aren't Mentari and I
waiting at the same gate?

421
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,333
Explain to them.

422
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:25,750
Afterlife.

423
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,666
You have different afterlives.

424
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,875
Afterlife?

425
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,875
Did you see the gate back there?

426
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:35,916
Did you?

427
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,791
That gate will take you
to your own respective afterlife.

428
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:44,041
But after we pass the gate,
can we still be together, sir?

429
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:47,583
You have different faiths, correct?
Am I right?

430
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,041
Then you can't.

431
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:51,791
Why?

432
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,208
Everyone has their own place
in the grand design.

433
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:59,041
You'll disturb the balance of the universe
if you defy that rule.

434
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:03,041
And if that happens, you'll regret
that you didn't listen to me.

435
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,166
-Come on, let's be done with it.
-No, wait.

436
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,833
But what if we were married?

437
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:13,708
Surely the wedding vow
can override those rules, right?

438
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,583
But were you married?

439
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,791
Not yet, right?

440
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:24,041
Listen. After a few centuries
on this job, I can tell easily.

441
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,791
Now your situation is very complicated.

442
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:31,083
-Technically, between one and another…
-Run, Tar.

443
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,875
Hey! I haven't finished talking.

444
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,625
Timur! Mentari!

445
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,750
Smile. Lower it a bit.

446
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:00,375
One, two… Okay.

447
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,000
Okay, next pose. Okay, Jo.

448
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,458
Are we back?

449
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:08,083
On the left cheek.

450
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,458
Reflector ready?

451
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:13,625
Smile. One, two… Okay.

452
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:17,708
One more time.

453
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay, Natasha. Pose.

454
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,750
One, two, three.

455
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:27,250
Hold.

456
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,875
Change pose. One, two…

457
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,000
Tar.

458
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,750
One, two…

459
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:47,125
Tim!

460
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:13,541
We can't touch anything natural…
or organic, Tim.

461
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,875
So we are ghosts now?

462
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,250
-Don't say that.
-Then what?

463
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:22,041
-Okay, don't panic.
-I'm not panicking. You are worse than me.

464
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:29,333
Are we dreaming?

465
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,750
If this is a dream, is it yours or mine?

466
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:42,916
Tim.

467
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,833
I once came here to draw.

468
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,000
It's not far from my home.

469
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,750
Let's go there and ask someone.

470
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,291
How? Can we do that?

471
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:59,583
Well, I don't know.
Do you have a better idea?

472
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:14,958
Sir!

473
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,041
Sir, where are you going?

474
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,666
Madam said that
you should stay at home. Okay?

475
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,916
Don't worry.

476
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,833
I'll tell them it was my idea.

477
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,000
Just take care of the house.

478
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,250
Oh, Dad!

479
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:25,916
Be patient.

480
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,166
-Yu…
-Hey!

481
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,375
-It's all your son's fault! His fault!
-Yu…

482
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:50,916
-Calm down.
-Watch what you're saying.

483
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,083
It's your daughter's car!

484
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,625
If he didn't go with your daughter,
nothing would have happened.

485
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,166
It's your responsibility!

486
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,083
-Your daughter should be!
-Your son drove the car!

487
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,166
Stop!

488
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,083
No, Dad. Don't.

489
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,041
This is a hospital.

490
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:15,125
Everyone needs to behave.

491
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,166
Yu.

492
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:23,166
This has been a tough day for all of us.

493
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,916
Please calm down.

494
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,000
We can talk about it another…

495
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:35,458
-Dad! Are you okay?
-Dad!

496
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,416
Nurse!

497
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,166
How's Grandpa?

498
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,541
He's still in the ICU.

499
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:34,291
I think that's not how it works, Tim.

500
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,000
Then how?

501
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:49,333
When I was a kid,
Grandpa told me this story.

502
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:55,166
He told me that his uncle
was once kidnapped by the devil.

503
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:59,458
When he was kidnapped,
he said he saw a forest…

504
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:15,791
Grandpa.

505
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,208
Come, Tar.

506
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,166
What are you doing?

507
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,541
You said Grandpa
knows something about the forest.

508
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:50,500
Grandpa.

509
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,000
Grandpa!

510
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,166
Mentari?

511
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,500
Where are we?

512
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:06,041
Thank god, you're back.

513
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:08,250
Grandpa.

514
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:11,041
You used to tell me a story

515
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:14,958
about your uncle
who was kidnapped by the devil, right?

516
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,750
Did he really see a forest?

517
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:21,708
Yes, he said it was a mystical forest.

518
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:25,083
How did he come back to life, Grandpa?

519
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,500
An angel brought him back.

520
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:32,041
The angel said it wasn't his time yet.

521
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:36,958
Because if he stayed, it would disturb
the balance of the universe.

522
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,125
Grandpa…

523
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,291
Actually, we just rescued you
from the forest guard.

524
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
You mean, that forest really exists?

525
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:52,958
So….

526
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:56,125
Am I dead?

527
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,041
And you're dead too?

528
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Maybe…

529
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,416
We have to go back to the forest.

530
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:07,750
Why Grandpa? You can stay here with us.

531
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,625
But I've been waiting
for this for a long time.

532
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,458
Aren't you afraid?

533
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:18,333
Since your grandma passed away,
I am not afraid anymore.

534
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:25,916
So don't you ever be afraid of death.
Okay?

535
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,916
I can't come with you, Grandpa.

536
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:37,458
Why?

537
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,708
Because…

538
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:51,083
You don't need to worry, Mentari.

539
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,125
Please take care of Mentari.

540
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:05,541
Tar.

541
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:07,916
Goodbye now, Grandpa.

542
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:44,500
Tar, why didn't you just go with Grandpa?

543
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:53,833
Because I didn't want to meet
those two people.

544
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,125
And then we'd be separated forever.

545
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:02,083
Yes, but you might be able
to go back and live.

546
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,583
Like Grandpa's uncle.

547
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:10,750
But what if only one of us
is allowed to go back?

548
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:21,500
Also, seeing your mother
and my mother that way…

549
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,458
I'm not ready, Tim.

550
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:39,125
Are you thinking the same way?

551
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,833
Yes, of course, Tar.

552
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,625
What does this mean?

553
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:54,166
I don't know.

554
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,458
Where should we go now?

555
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,250
How about going to your favorite spot?

556
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:14,125
It's closed.

557
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,333
It's made of wood.

558
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:46,250
Seeing a painting like this…

559
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:53,916
reminds me that
I still have a lot to learn.

560
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:59,000
I think yours is just as great.

561
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:02,875
Oh, really?

562
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,291
Yes.

563
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:10,208
Even though you rarely show me your work.

564
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:12,208
I don't even know the details
of the book you are working on.

565
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,083
What do you want to know?

566
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:24,500
Everything.

567
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:27,666
The characters are a couple.

568
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:30,500
What's interesting about them?

569
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:34,958
Yes, they're a couple.

570
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,458
But they're different.

571
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,750
Different? How?

572
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:42,625
Everything.

573
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,291
-What else?
-And then…

574
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,416
they're hiding it from their parents.

575
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:58,583
I don't know
if people could relate to that.

576
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,125
If it's personal for you,
I'm sure people would relate.

577
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,041
Tim…

578
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:35,958
I haven't finished my book.

579
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:47,708
I'm sorry.

580
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:54,791
It's all right.

581
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:56,750
There's nothing we can do.

582
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,041
Where should we go tomorrow?

583
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,541
It's already tomorrow.

584
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:17,250
Then today, and tomorrow,
and the day after tomorrow?

585
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,583
How about leaving the country?

586
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,250
-No?
-No.

587
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,416
We should stay at the Presidential Palace.

588
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,666
No way, there are lots of ghosts there!

589
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,500
-But you are also a ghost!
-Stop it!

590
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,333
Tim!

591
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:46,250
Who are you?

592
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,166
Wait!

593
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,666
Why are you following me?

594
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:20,125
How can you see us?

595
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:32,291
Wow. It's been a while since I saw this…

596
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,000
You're still in a coma.

597
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,041
-Interesting.
-Wait!

598
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:40,375
Where are you going?

599
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:45,250
Home. Where are you staying?

600
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,916
We're staying at…

601
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:50,500
We don't have anywhere to stay.

602
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:52,875
Can we come with you?

603
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:58,083
It's no use.
You won't be able to see the place.

604
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:00,708
Why?

605
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,333
Because you still have one foot
in the human realm.

606
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,708
And this place is not for humans.

607
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,125
I don't understand.

608
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:16,083
Let me explain.
Now, your eyes are closed like this.

609
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,625
There are two things that you can do.

610
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,916
Go up, back to your life,

611
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,375
or dive deeper into this abyss,

612
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:30,500
move away from your life,

613
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:32,875
and maybe you will see
this beautiful place

614
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,416
where there is no envy,
anger, and judgment.

615
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:40,166
-But how do we do that?
-I can't tell you how.

616
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,916
Everyone is different.
You can figure it out yourselves.

617
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,583
Wait, she's gone!

618
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:55,583
I've heard stories about people in comas
suddenly disappearing.

619
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,666
But this is the first time
I've seen it myself.

620
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,250
How's the story?

621
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,541
Usually, they like to be
near their bodies.

622
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,125
How do I get her back?

623
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:07,416
Sorry, I can't be of much help.

624
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:11,958
Mentari!

625
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:15,166
Tar!

626
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,833
Tari.

627
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,791
I remember when you were little,

628
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:57,375
you said you wanted to go
around the world,

629
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,333
you wanted to paint…

630
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:07,041
and then teach other kids how to draw.

631
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,791
Remember that, dear?

632
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,916
Tari.

633
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:29,500
Uncle, Auntie…

634
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,916
I'm leaving now.

635
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:36,583
Mom and Dad said that they'll come

636
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:40,375
after taking care of Grandpa's funeral.

637
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:15,875
Tar.

638
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,083
I'm sorry.

639
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:29,125
This is all my fault.

640
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:33,625
Tim…

641
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:38,916
getting into the car with you
was my choice.

642
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,666
If there should be anyone
to blame for all this,

643
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,166
it would be both of us.

644
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,208
Not just you, Tim.

645
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,166
Whatever happens…

646
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,666
we'll get through it together, okay?

647
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:30,291
Hi!

648
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,250
Welcome to Pancarona House!

649
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,916
Strange. It's not completely gone.

650
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,500
What do you mean?

651
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:59,250
The stamp. Your life.

652
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:03,750
Never mind.

653
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,416
-I'm Edith.
-Mentari.

654
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,500
I'm Timur.

655
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:15,250
Luckily someone just moved,
so this room is available.

656
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:17,541
Moved?

657
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:20,250
Yes, moved out.

658
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,166
Forget it. Come with me.

659
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,083
I'll introduce you to
the owners of this house.

660
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:45,041
This is Timur and Mentari.
I told you about them yesterday.

661
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:48,291
Hello. Welcome.

662
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:50,541
Hello.

663
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:53,083
Are you the owners of this house?

664
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,916
Why? We don't look like we are?

665
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,208
No. It's a beautiful house.
Thanks for having us.

666
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:06,000
This house is always open for everyone.

667
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:10,416
Edith, the thing you mentioned yesterday…

668
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,500
You too?

669
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,333
Wang, come here!

670
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:28,541
Man, they gave me another tablet!

671
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,333
You've got to see this.

672
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,541
Wow!

673
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:35,541
I haven't seen this in a long time.

674
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:39,958
Wait.

675
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,166
I think I've seen you before.

676
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,625
-At the forest!
-When I was with my wife… Oops!

677
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,750
Actually, I wonder, why are you here?

678
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,958
What do you mean?

679
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:04,583
What's wrong with you?

680
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:07,458
Don't you want to go back to your life?

681
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:10,416
I've tried going back to my body,
but I couldn't.

682
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,333
Did you try with your whole heart?

683
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:26,083
Don't think too much about it.
Here, it's for you.

684
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,000
What for, Uncle?

685
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:29,875
Just take it as a welcome gift.

686
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:34,958
Welcome to the place without envy, anger…

687
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,000
…and judgment.

688
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,791
Hope you enjoy your death.

689
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,708
Come here. Have a seat.

690
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:49,625
I have to go.

691
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:50,875
Where to?

692
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,208
A personal matter.

693
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:58,666
Don't be surprised.

694
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,166
Edith loves to wander around alone.

695
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:07,625
Since we opened up our home for everyone,

696
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:10,791
we've met a lot of
different kinds of people.

697
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:12,916
You mean ghosts.

698
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:20,250
When did you open up
this house for everyone?

699
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:25,541
Well, I waited for Diah's passing
for about 30 years.

700
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:27,750
I used to live here.

701
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,166
But after I died,

702
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:32,958
everyone left this house,

703
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:35,708
including my ex-husband.

704
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,416
So we got married
and have lived here ever since…

705
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:43,916
as ghosts.

706
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,666
Married?

707
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,958
You must be thinking
that we are mother and son.

708
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:11,750
We fell in love when we were teenagers.

709
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:16,833
But unfortunately,
Diah married someone else.

710
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:20,666
Well…

711
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,791
It was an arranged marriage.

712
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,750
Shortly after Diah got married,

713
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:30,750
I hung myself.

714
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,916
But after so many years…

715
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:43,250
Herman finally managed
to drive my ex-husband away,

716
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,291
then brought me here.

717
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,375
Died happily ever after.

718
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,958
I made a promise to Diah

719
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:56,208
that we would be together forever.

720
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:01,375
That promise binds us
even though I died before her.

721
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,125
Without that…

722
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:08,250
we might not have met
each other again after death.

723
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:12,375
But how did you get married here?

724
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,750
We just did it.

725
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,333
Said our vows.

726
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:19,916
You two are not married, right?

727
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,083
You can if you want to.

728
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,041
Why?

729
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,458
What's the problem?

730
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,375
Your parents' blessing?

731
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,416
We have different religions.

732
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:57,291
You are ghosts.

733
01:08:58,625 --> 01:08:59,875
Nobody cares.

734
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:06,041
The question is not how to do it.

735
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:10,916
But are you ready to
leave everything behind?

736
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:16,625
Especially with your condition now.

737
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:26,958
Uncle.

738
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:39,958
This is where we used to sit and…

739
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:45,375
chat, joke, and debate.

740
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,000
Me and my wife,

741
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,416
we spent most of our lives together.

742
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,958
Even in death.

743
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:01,166
Now, somehow I feel…

744
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:03,916
empty.

745
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:09,166
Why didn't you go with her
to the afterlife?

746
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:16,208
She always says,

747
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:22,291
being a ghost only traps us in the past.

748
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,666
We debated about that a lot.

749
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,208
I tried to convince her to stay…

750
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:34,250
but she was determined to leave.

751
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:41,291
I didn't want to force her to stay here,

752
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,916
so I let her go.

753
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:52,166
Turns out, it's harder to let someone go…

754
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,166
than leave someone.

755
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:08,791
Tar.

756
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:29,541
We've tried everything, honey.

757
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:34,041
The doctor said it's not instant, Yu.

758
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:35,666
It takes time.

759
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,125
Until when?

760
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:44,666
We already brought
all of Mentari's belongings.

761
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:51,291
Maybe…

762
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:57,041
Mentari doesn't want to go back.

763
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,000
Don't say that!

764
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:04,083
Maybe…

765
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:07,500
Mentari feels…

766
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:11,291
that we are not good parents.

767
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,208
Yu.

768
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,208
Mentari would never think that way.

769
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:18,416
Be patient.

770
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:32,958
Hello?

771
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:34,958
Yes, sir.

772
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,750
What book, sir?

773
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,333
Ah… Yes.

774
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,291
Thank you, sir.

775
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,333
-Yu.
-Yes?

776
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:53,666
They found a sketchbook in Mentari's car.

777
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,500
A sketchbook?

778
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,416
They only found it now?

779
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:00,791
It was kept at the police station.

780
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,208
If only I knew…

781
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:38,166
how to stop all of this, Tim.

782
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,750
Are you even ready?

783
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:51,541
What do you mean?

784
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,208
I have something to tell you.

785
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:21,916
Tar…

786
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:30,583
I used to regret not knowing much
about you during high school.

787
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,041
I also regretted…

788
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,791
that I didn't express my love
before you moved to Australia.

789
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:45,125
I don't want to make
the same mistake, Tar.

790
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,083
I want to be with you forever.

791
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:56,666
Do you want to…

792
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,916
leave everything behind and marry me here?

793
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,250
What's wrong?

794
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,750
Nothing, I'm just…

795
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,500
happy.

796
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,083
Congratulations!

797
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,250
If you need anything to prepare,

798
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:51,958
don't hesitate to call
our housekeeper, okay?

799
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:54,291
Herman and Diah, thanks a lot.

800
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,083
Dith!

801
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,708
-Where are you going?
-Personal matter.

802
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,041
Can we come?

803
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:11,958
You won't like it.

804
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,291
Aren't you curious
as to where Edith is going?

805
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:25,125
Just let her be. We don't need to know
other people's business.

806
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:54,083
You are not really good at tailing people.

807
01:17:58,791 --> 01:17:59,750
Come here.

808
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,625
Let me introduce you
to my little sister, Kamila.

809
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:05,583
What do you think?

810
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:07,916
She's cute, isn't she?

811
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,416
How old is she?

812
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:12,833
She's 75 years old.

813
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:17,458
When I died,

814
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:20,500
she was younger than you.

815
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:23,750
When I was alive…

816
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,541
I spent too much time for myself.

817
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:34,375
I didn't spend enough time for Kamila.

818
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:42,125
Even though, during my final days,

819
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,791
when I needed someone,

820
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:48,083
Kamila was the one who stayed by my side.

821
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:51,500
That's why I'm waiting for her.

822
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:55,166
Since when?

823
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:02,541
Forty or fifty years ago.

824
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:05,958
Time has no meaning anymore.

825
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,458
But Dith,

826
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,250
why do you have to wait here?

827
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,958
It's harder to leave someone
rather than being left behind.

828
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,541
I've felt both.

829
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,208
Edith.

830
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,500
You better leave
if you don't want to be taken away.

831
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:22,541
You're Kamila, right?

832
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,541
Strange, your death is supposed
to be in two weeks.

833
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:29,708
But I'm ready, sir.

834
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:33,458
Can we go now?

835
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:36,208
Have you been dead for a long time?

836
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:42,333
I see… you should've gone
to the afterlife a long time ago.

837
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:48,458
But you're lucky
your sister passed away earlier.

838
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:52,083
At least it's enough
to cover your debt to…

839
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:55,000
To keep the balance? I understand.

840
01:20:57,791 --> 01:20:59,125
-Tar.
-Yes?

841
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:01,666
Are you okay?

842
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:07,333
I'm fine. I'm just happy that
Edith got to see Kamila again.

843
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,250
Okay. Let's go.

844
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:16,458
Tar.

845
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,333
Tar?

846
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:45,500
Mentari never told us
about the contents of this book.

847
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:50,958
Honey,

848
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:54,083
does Roy still work
at the publishing house?

849
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:57,583
He does. Actually, he just got promoted.

850
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:02,083
He's looking for lots of new material.

851
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:06,416
What did he say about Mentari's book?

852
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,791
He's interested.
It has potential, he said,

853
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:13,041
but it still needs to be polished.

854
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:16,791
That's good, we should follow up with him.

855
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:18,208
Yes.

856
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:23,916
But the only person
who can finish the book and do it justice

857
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,666
is Mentari.

858
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:32,625
Tar, did you hear that?

859
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,666
You still have a lot of dreams
that you haven't achieved.

860
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:39,791
Wake up, kid.

861
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,875
Finish your book.

862
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,041
Tar.

863
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:48,625
Yu.

864
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:54,458
They also found this in Mentari's car.

865
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:07,541
Since when…

866
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,083
has she liked stuff like this?

867
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:14,791
Well…

868
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:23,666
I've just realized that
we haven't fully understood Mentari.

869
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:40,416
Hi, Pete.

870
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,541
Relax, Mom. The car is safe and sound.

871
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:51,041
Don't forget to prepare the 906 type.
Two units.

872
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:52,125
So someone's really going to buy them?

873
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:56,375
Yes. And there is another customer
who ordered a dozen more.

874
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,166
Okay, got it.

875
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,916
They don't need me anymore, Tar.

876
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:11,208
Pete.

877
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:13,666
Mom.

878
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:16,291
Please let me go.

879
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:21,250
I am ready to go.

880
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:29,916
Pete.

881
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:31,750
Yes, Mom.

882
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,916
Do you think that
your brother will forgive me?

883
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:41,166
I can't let him go like this.

884
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,875
I don't want him to misunderstand me.

885
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:46,583
What do you mean, Mom?

886
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:52,833
Before he left, we had an argument

887
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,708
about Mentari.

888
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,791
I told him that I disapproved
of their relationship.

889
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:04,875
Your dad and I were of the same religion,
but we still fought a lot.

890
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:07,958
What more of them,
having different religions?

891
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,833
I just don't want him to be disappointed.

892
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:17,458
If only I'd let her come in,

893
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:19,625
none of this would have happened.

894
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:22,958
It's my fault, Pete.

895
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:26,708
Tar, Mentari…

896
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:28,625
Tar, I'm sorry.

897
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,583
I shouldn't have lied.

898
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:33,500
I just didn't want to make things worse.

899
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:35,958
It's not only about your lie, Tim.

900
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:40,625
Don't you feel that
something is wrong with all of this?

901
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:48,041
Pancarona, Edith, Wang, Herman, Diah…

902
01:25:49,041 --> 01:25:50,000
Us.

903
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,166
Us?

904
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:56,125
We're not supposed to be here, Tim.

905
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:00,041
I thought you wanted
to be with me forever.

906
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:04,083
I want to be with you forever, I do.

907
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:07,875
But not here. Not in this limbo.

908
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,708
So you prefer to return to a world

909
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:15,625
where everyone disagrees
with our relationship?

910
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:18,791
Don't you feel guilty
seeing your mom suffering like that?

911
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:26,250
Take a look at my mom and dad too.
They're also suffering, Tim.

912
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:27,500
It's all because of us!

913
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:28,625
Tar.

914
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:32,000
-Don't you have any feelings?
-Hey.

915
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:36,750
Can't you see that my family
doesn't need me anymore?

916
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:40,625
They're not the only ones
who are suffering.

917
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,625
We are too!

918
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:48,541
You have to remember, Tar.

919
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:51,500
I am willing to leave everything…

920
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,541
for you.

921
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,625
Isn't that what you want?

922
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,458
Mentari.

923
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,083
I haven't been fully honest with you, Tim.

924
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:25,875
What do you mean?

925
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:30,708
Today,

926
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:33,791
I went to the hospital

927
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:39,041
not because of my parents' pleas.

928
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:45,208
I went to hospital…

929
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,625
because that was what I wanted.

930
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:55,833
There were times…

931
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:00,250
when I really wanted to see them, Tim.

932
01:28:05,291 --> 01:28:07,750
I really miss them,

933
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:17,500
and I want to be with them.

934
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:36,750
Okay, Tar.

935
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:42,458
But let me ask you this question.

936
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,333
Do you still want to leave
everything behind…

937
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:54,708
and marry me here?

938
01:29:06,416 --> 01:29:08,125
Okay. Now I get it.

939
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,250
Tim.

940
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:28,000
{\an8}ALWAYS AMAZING
LET'S DO IT AGAIN

941
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:30,750
{\an8}EVERY TIME WE MEET UP
DON'T GIVE UP, MENTARI

942
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,375
Tim!

943
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:16,041
How's my car? Is it cool?

944
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:20,041
It's great, Uncle.
Where did you get it from?

945
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,875
Oh, I'll explain later.

946
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:24,375
Where's Mentari?

947
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:28,625
Had an argument?

948
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:30,375
Jeez.

949
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:33,500
Rather than being all gloomy,
just come with me now. Get in!

950
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:35,000
Where are we going?

951
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,583
Just get in if you want to know
where I got my car from. Come on, get in.

952
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:42,916
Oh, boy…

953
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:49,083
Okay. To cheer you up,
anything I get today will be yours. Okay?

954
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,125
Wow, you get an airplane!

955
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:02,166
Can you fly a plane?

956
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:19,708
She is my youngest child.
Isn't she pretty?

957
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:23,083
She takes care of my business now.

958
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:30,916
He is my oldest one.

959
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:38,583
Hey, come here!

960
01:31:57,541 --> 01:31:58,541
-Uncle.
-Yes?

961
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:01,291
I think he is scared.

962
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:04,625
There's no way that
he's scared of his own dad.

963
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,500
Is it okay

964
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,208
for you to haunt him like this?

965
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:22,125
Look at his condition, Tim.

966
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:26,125
He still needs me to be around,

967
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,083
to protect him.

968
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:33,833
If I may ask, why is he…

969
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:40,708
He was really sick
when he was little, a high fever.

970
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:47,833
The stupid thing was I didn't take him
to a doctor, but to a shaman.

971
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:52,958
After that, he couldn't stand
on his feet anymore.

972
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,375
I had to be on his side
everywhere he went.

973
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:03,708
Can you imagine
how terrified he was when I died?

974
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:10,125
He became like this because of me,

975
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:13,500
and I died instead of helping him.

976
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:22,208
Why not look on the bright side?

977
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:24,208
He needs to be independent anyway.

978
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:26,875
You're just like my wife.

979
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:32,375
My wife doesn't like it
when I follow him around.

980
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:36,208
At home, to the mall.

981
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:40,500
She doesn't understand
that I need to protect him,

982
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:43,500
even from afar like this.

983
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:46,291
Besides.

984
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,166
if not me, who else will?

985
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:53,875
Sorry, Uncle.

986
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:58,708
So that was the reason your wife left?

987
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,666
I'm not asking you to understand, Tim.

988
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:07,708
But look, whose photo is it
that he keeps holding?

989
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:12,750
He can't let me go just yet.

990
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:16,750
How can I leave him
and move on to the afterlife?

991
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:23,250
He still needs me around here.

992
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:27,375
I won't leave him twice.

993
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:36,500
Maybe everyone has their own way
to bring happiness to their loved ones.

994
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,416
Maybe this is my way.

995
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:48,250
I'm sure you have your own way
to make Mentari happy.

996
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,916
Stop holding on to it.

997
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:07,333
Uncle, can I borrow your car?

998
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:30,916
Mom, the doctor said
his condition has improved today.

999
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:36,250
I hope he can recover soon.

1000
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,375
-Honey.
-Mentari.

1001
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:59,291
-Mentari! I'm calling the nurse.
-Hurry!

1002
01:35:59,916 --> 01:36:00,833
Mentari.

1003
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:07,708
The nurse is here, Yu.

1004
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:10,875
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Nurse.

1005
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:13,500
-Call the doctor now! Code blue.
-Okay.

1006
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:13,625
Come on. What are you waiting for?

1007
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,041
Tar!

1008
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,458
Mentari!

1009
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:37,541
Timur…

1010
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,541
Hey, where are you going?

1011
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:45,416
Please, let me talk to him one last time.

1012
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:34,916
It's time for me to go, Tim.

1013
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:45,166
I don't want to make my parents
suffer any longer.

1014
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:57,083
Let me go.

1015
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,500
Okay?

1016
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:12,666
Yes, Tar.

1017
01:39:16,166 --> 01:39:17,708
I'll let you go…

1018
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,625
back to the world of the living.

1019
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:41,833
The balance, Tar.

1020
01:39:45,291 --> 01:39:47,375
My body is still in a stable condition,

1021
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:52,666
and I want to give that to you.

1022
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,041
What are you talking about, Tim?

1023
01:40:10,041 --> 01:40:11,583
My life is over, Tar.

1024
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:14,416
My mom.

1025
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:16,541
Peter.

1026
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:19,500
They don't need me around anymore.

1027
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:23,416
And you know…

1028
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:28,875
I have always tried to make you happy.

1029
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:37,125
Even though I always fail in the end.

1030
01:40:50,083 --> 01:40:51,500
But now…

1031
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,208
I'm sure that
I can finally make you happy, Tar.

1032
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:06,625
But not like this, Tim. Not like this.

1033
01:41:08,916 --> 01:41:09,916
Tar…

1034
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:21,750
Promise me…

1035
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:25,958
that you will follow your dreams…

1036
01:41:31,041 --> 01:41:32,250
and let me go, Tar.

1037
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:34,833
Okay?

1038
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:42,791
Wherever I will end up…

1039
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:49,208
I will always love you.

1040
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:26,250
Hello, Auntie.

1041
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,000
Go ahead, Mentari.

1042
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:55,416
Auntie.

1043
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,250
I'm sorry for everything that happened.

1044
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:13,291
I can only give you this book.

1045
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:20,458
I'm sure Timur wants you to read this.

1046
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:31,666
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

1047
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:35,500
All these times, I was wrong about you.

1048
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:38,750
Please don't apologize to me.

1049
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:42,833
I'm the one who should be grateful to you.

1050
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,375
Timur…

1051
01:45:48,958 --> 01:45:51,708
is the most beautiful memory of my life.

1052
01:45:58,375 --> 01:46:01,458
I heard you wanted to go abroad?

1053
01:46:03,125 --> 01:46:04,291
Yes, Auntie.

1054
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:09,333
There are some places
I need to visit for my second book.

1055
01:46:09,958 --> 01:46:11,958
But not for long.

1056
01:46:14,291 --> 01:46:19,750
Actually, I still have
many things to do here.

1057
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:23,916
I'm going to open
an art school for children,

1058
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:27,375
just as Timur asked.

1059
01:46:28,958 --> 01:46:31,541
I miss him so much.

1060
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,541
I'm sure he is still around.

1061
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:20,791
