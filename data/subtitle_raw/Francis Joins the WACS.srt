175
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291

He's not a she!

180
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:36,666
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Good afternoon, Major.

181
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,142
Would you mind stepping
into my office, Lieutenant?

182
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,541
What's going on, Captain?

183
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,350
I was about to ask
that same question.

184
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,041
He's your retread,
Major Simpson.

185
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:45,124
He?

186
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,916
Lieutenant Stirling.

187
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:51,499
"Peter Stirling."

188
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,308
Now I understand why our
retread wasn't on that train.

189
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:56,957
A terrible mistake
has been made.

190
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:58,957
They sent us a... A man?

191
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:02,416
Good heavens, I certainly
stipulated I wanted a WAC officer!

192
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,207
I guess the words "overseas
experience" confused them.

193
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,308
Make out a request for transfer

194
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,874
and get him out of this area.

195
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:08,957
Check Post Headquarters.

196
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,308
They can put him up
until we get rid of him.

197
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:11,749
Yes, Major.

198
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,308
Well, Lieutenant.

199
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:21,124
How does it feel to be a WAC?

200
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:23,308
Now just a minute, this...
This is a mistake!

201
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,332
Uh, isn't it?

202
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,832
I'm afraid you don't quite
fit our physical standard.

203
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:29,624
Well, naturally not.
A man in the WACs.

204
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:30,707
What do you mean by that?

205
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,291
Uh, I just meant it's funny, that's all.
The WACs.

206
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,082
If there's anything
funny about it,

207
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,624
it's some of you men
who make it so.

208
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:37,791
Despite your amusement,

209
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:39,374
we prefer to think
of women in uniform

210
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,267
as a serious business.
Yeah, but, I didn't mean...

211
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,666
Your masculine ego
refuses to admit that...

212
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,308
That the Women's Army Corps
can serve any place

213
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:47,541
but in kitchens or for clerical work!
Isn't that so?

214
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,041
I didn't say that.
That's what you meant!

215
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,166
Lieutenant Stirling.

216
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,957
For the moment, you've
been assigned to us.

217
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,207
Thinking it over,

218
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,374
it might be very nice to have
a man around the company.

219
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,541
Yeah, well...

220
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:05,291
Yes, yes, to help us
helpless women.

221
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,207
As a hardened combat vet,

222
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,971
you'll no doubt put us
poor women to shame,

223
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,791
but, uh, we'll try
to keep up with you.

224
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:14,249
Now, now, now, really, sir.
I, uh, madam.

225
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,707
I, no, Captain, I think...
I think the WACs are wonderful.

226
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,999
They're... They're just
wonderful in their place.

227
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:21,332
In our place!

228
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,558
Yes, in your place,
I think you're just...

229
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:23,582
(DOOR OPENS)

230
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,791
Yes, Corporal Hilstrom?

231
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:27,291
Post billets
are all filled, ma'am.

232
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:29,207
Well, Guest Bungalow Six
is unoccupied.

233
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,749
You can put him in there.

234
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,472
Uh-oh. Uh-oh, what
does she mean, "uh-oh"?

235
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,874
Is anything wrong?

236
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,832
No, ma'am, not yet.

237
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,249
But it's a start.

238
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:41,457
(STAMMERS) What did she mean?

239
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,416
Need I explain? Uh-huh.

240
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:45,600
Well, Lieutenant, in the
course of your duties with us,

241
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:48,041
you'll be in contact with
the women of this battalion.

242
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:49,749
You will avoid any incident.

243
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:51,041
Uh, incident?

244
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,183
Oh, good heavens, Lieutenant,
you had combat in Burma.

245
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,082
Weren't there any
Burmese girls there?

246
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,124
Oh, yes, yes. They
used to sell us things.

247
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,499
I can imagine. Yeah, uh-huh.

248
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:00,058
I used to take some
of them home with me.

249
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:01,124
You did? Oh, yes.

250
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:02,184
The cutest little wood carvings.

251
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,558
You know, in those little...
Little monkeys that...

252
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,041
You may go now, Lieutenant.

253
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:06,291
Oh, thank you very much.

254
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,999
Oh, uh, where?

255
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:10,916
You will be assigned the
duties of a WAC officer.

256
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,374
You mean, I'm a WAC?

257
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,416
Until you've had a change
of assignment, yes.

258
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:15,541
(STAMMERING)

259
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:17,291
Dismissed! I just...

260
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,666
Well. A WAC. (CHUCKLES)

261
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:58,916
Fancy earmuffs.

262
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:45,957
What am I doin' in the WACs?

263
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:48,416
MALE VOICE: That's
a logical question.

264
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,249
I... Who said that?

265
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:55,166
Your old, furry cousin.
1000 pounds of loveable mule

266
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:56,457
on the hoof. Mmm-hmm.

267
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:58,374
Well, Francis!

268
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,291
Francis! It couldn't be!

269
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:02,457
Says you. Well, then it
was you on the train!

270
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,541
Yeah.

271
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:04,916
Boy, am I glad to see you!

272
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,999
Lieutenant, please!

273
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:09,707
What kind of an indoctrination
are they giving you?

274
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,999
Oh, I'm in terrible trouble.

275
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,124
Well, that figures.

276
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,082
Me, Peter Stirling, in the WACs.

277
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,582
I'm in and they
won't let me out!

278
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,058
(STAMMERING) I don't
wanna be a WAC!

279
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,082
Oh, simmer down, Petey
boy, that's why I'm here.

280
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,058
I heard the
classification machine

281
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,582
at the Pentagon went snafu

282
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,749
and tapped you for duty
with the ladies

283
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:27,041
of the Army Corps. Well...

284
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:28,267
Oh, so that's how it happened?

285
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,749
And it only could happen to you.

286
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,683
Yeah. Yeah, well, you did
come to get me out?

287
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:36,041
What a fate! Wet nurse to
an upper-class shavetail!

288
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:38,499
For this I had
to get myself transferred

289
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:40,874
to the medical research
lab on this post.

290
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,332
I'm checkin' in in the morning.

291
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:43,666
Oh, that's wonderful!

292
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,041
Wonderful? Yeah!

293
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:48,017
They needed a guinea pig
to try their injections on.

294
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,017
So, shake hands
with the guinea pig. Me.

295
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,249
Oh, I'm sorry, Francis.

296
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,892
Yeah, but you are gonna
help me out, aren't ya?

297
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,957
Well, I won't be able
to sit for a while

298
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,957
and I hate to stand around
doing nothing.

299
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,791
Oh, thanks, Francis.
Thanks a million!

300
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:02,624
Oh, Pete, cut that out!
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

301
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:03,707
What's that? Shh!

302
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,017
(WHISPERS) Sounds like
retreat to me.

303
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,207
For you.

304
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,166
Oh, uh, excuse me. Is there,
uh, is something wrong?

305
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:19,374
We heard voices. You are
supposed to be alone.

306
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:21,166
Oh. Well, there's
no one here but me.

307
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:22,874
That's what we were told.

308
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,999
Oh, uh, believe me,
there's no one in it!

309
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:31,082
What about this?

310
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,499
There's no one in that, either.

311
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:36,499
Now, if... If I need
you, I'll call you.

312
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:38,499
I will. I'll call you.

313
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,957
Francis? Francis! Oh.
(CAR WHIRRING)

314
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:55,933
That's Bungalow Six, Lieutenant.

315
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,041
Thanks, Sergeant.

316
00:16:57,124 --> 00:17:00,082
But are you sure the OD
didn't say Quarter Six?

317
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:01,332
She said six something.

318
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,541
I'll worry about it tomorrow
when I'm not so sleepy.

319
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:04,957
Good night.

320
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,957
Oh, I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I thought... (GASPS)

321
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,041
(SCREAMING)

322
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,225
Please, don't... Don't scream!

323
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,350
(SCREAMS) Please,
please, don't scream.

324
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:00,374
What are you doing here?

325
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:01,577
I really am very sorry. I...

326
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:02,666
(SCREAMS) Shh!

327
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,541
Help! Help! I... Help!

328
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:10,832
(SCREAMS) I'm sorry.

329
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:12,082
(DOOR OPENS)

330
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,166
Alone, huh?

331
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,100
Now... Now I know
what you're thinking,

332
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:24,249
but it's not so. Honestly!

333
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,666
You'd better come with us.
Get dressed.

334
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,850
Now... Now I know
what you're thinking!

335
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,707
But it's not so, honestly!

336
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,808
Now I know what you're thinking,
but it's not so, honestly.

337
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:33,957
You can wait outside. I'll
get your report later.

338
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,517
Now I know what you're
thinking, but it's not so...

339
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,374
Lieutenant, I want the truth.

340
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:39,541
Now, really it was...
It was nothing!

341
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:40,808
Nothing? Yes.

342
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:43,957
Two incidents in one night?
Your first night here?

343
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,142
Well, now, believe me, I...

344
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,207
Uh, two incidents?

345
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,517
What was... What was
the first one?

346
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,767
Then you admit
there was a second?

347
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,850
Uh, yeah, no, ma'am.
I just thought

348
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,142
the second one
was the first one.

349
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,707
Well, we won't discuss
the order of your romances.

350
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,350
You were distinctly heard
speaking to someone

Who was the other girl?

352
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,749
Uh, it wasn't any girl.

353
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,768
It had to be a girl.

354
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,600
There are hundreds of them
stationed in this area.

355
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:02,767
Nothing but girls.

356
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,916
Not one girl was in my bungalow.
Not... Not one.

357
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:06,207
What about Lieutenant Dickson?

358
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:08,041
(STAMMERS) Well, I was
there before she was!

359
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,350
That didn't give you the privilege
of making advances to her.

360
00:20:10,374 --> 00:20:13,041
(STAMMERING) Why, I didn't.
Why, I didn't.

361
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,267
Don't tell me, she screamed
because you didn't make advances.

362
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,707
Yes, ma'am. Uh, no, ma'am!

363
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,191
(STAMMERS) I don't know
what I mean!

364
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:20,957
If your motives were so pure,

365
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,791
why didn't you
immediately contact the OD

366
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:24,374
and notify her of the mistake?

367
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,249
Well, I couldn't. The lieutenant
was getting undressed.

368
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,749
You... You saw her undressing?

369
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,832
No, ma'am. I shut my eyes.

370
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:34,683
Then how do you know
she was getting undressed?

371
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:35,725
(STAMMERS) I don't know!

372
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,725
I... I just thought she
might be, that's all, I...

373
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:39,332
(STAMMERS)
Well, uh, you gotta...

374
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,600
You gotta take your clothes
off to get into bed, don't you?

375
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:42,749
I... Now I'm all confused.

376
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:44,725
I shouldn't wonder.

377
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:47,541
Lieutenant Stirling, your records
arrived here this afternoon.

378
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:49,416
They were very interesting.

379
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,707
Need any help, toots?

380
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,749
What did you say?

381
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,374
Hmm? I... I didn't say anything.

382
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:04,332
If you get stuck, you can spend
the night with me in the stable.

383
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:07,957
Lieutenant, you must fancy
yourself a veritable Don Juan!

384

386
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:13,707
You get into trouble and try to
talk yourself into a psycho ward.

387
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:15,999
You've been in trouble before.

388

That's really gold-bricking.

390
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:23,433
Well, I tried to tell 'em...

391
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,749
I can see right here what
you tried to tell them,

392
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:27,683
that a mule talked to you.

393
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:29,142
They didn't believe me.
And neither would [!

394
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,832
So don't pull any of that
mule hanky-panky around here!

00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:43,183
to laugh the girls right out
of their camouflage suits!

528
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:44,207
Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,308
Now what are
they all gonna think

530
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:46,999
when they see a man in the WACs?

531
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:48,582
Francis, I just gotta
get out of this!

532
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,624
Ooh! Easy, boy.

533
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,874
They snuck up on me
with a square needle.

534
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,166
I'm sorry, Francis, I forgot.

535
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:55,291
They didn't waste any time.

536
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:57,041
And I'd suggest
you don't either.

537
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:58,124
Hey!

538
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:00,167
There's a shortcut to the
finish line over yonder!

539
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,184
Okay.

540
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:02,499
Now, that wouldn't be fair.

541
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:04,749
All is fair in love and war.

542
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:05,874
Get going!

543
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:07,350
Well, that girl is way
ahead of me, isn't she?

544
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:10,166
Mmm-hmm, there is the
understatement of the year.

545
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,957
Come on! Mmm!

546
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,624

00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,142
Congratulations! Thank you.

00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,707
Good work.

(GRUNTS)

552
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,791
Are you all right, Lieutenant?
Yeah, I'm... Oh, yeah!

553
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:37,957
Yes, I, uh...

554
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:40,558
I just misjudged the height a
little, that's all. Oh! (CHUCKLES)

555
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:42,957
Oh, well. (CHUCKLES)

556
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,582
Well, that's not all I misjudged.
You WACs are terrific.

557
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,225
(CHUCKLES) You know, I have to admit
that it really wasn't very fair.

558
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:51,416
You see, Private Wilson
was an Olympic Champion.

559
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:54,041
Oh. Well, I'm glad to
know that she's human.

560
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:56,041
I thought she might be
a new secret weapon!

561
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:59,207
Oh. Here, here,
lean on my shoulder.

562
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,332
Oh, thank you.

563
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,999
I'm, uh, glad to know you
WAC officers are human, too.

564
00:31:05,082 --> 00:31:06,100
What do you mean?

565
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:09,457
Oh, I thought you were hard as nails.
You're really very soft underneath.

566
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:13,100
I mean, underneath.
Uh, uh, way underneath.

567
00:31:13,124 --> 00:31:14,666
The real you,

568
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:16,124
that, that's what I mean!

569
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,308
Well, our complexities won't
puzzle you much longer, Lieutenant.

570
00:31:19,332 --> 00:31:22,124
I'm sure Major Simpson
will expedite your transfer.

571
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,207
Oh, I'm not a bit puzzled.

572
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,124
I understand why
you're all so sensitive.

573
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:29,100
I suppose General Kaye's attitude
does get you on edge. (CHUCKLES)

574
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:30,916
What do you know
about General Kaye?

575
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,100
Oh, I sure hope you surprise him

576
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,844
when you have your big
camouflage operation.

577
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:35,082
(CHUCKLING)

578
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:38,791
Hey, Captain Parker, I... Captain
Parker, I got a wonderful idea!

579
00:31:38,874 --> 00:31:39,957
Now that we're friends,

580
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:43,082
what do you say we both go to
the Post dance together tonight?

581
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:44,624
Huh?

582
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:48,207
Uh... Hmm.

583
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,207
Francis was right,

584
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:53,457
every WAC is a woman. Except me.

585
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:55,832
But it's impossible!

586
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,058
General Kaye just informed
us of the field operation!

587
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,082
No one knows about It here but you and me!
And General Kaye.

588
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,058
The old fox!

589
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:04,416
I didn't think he'd stoop to it,

590
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:06,416
but the evidence leads
to only one conclusion!

591
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,791
Lieutenant Stirling was
sent here by General Kaye.

592
00:32:08,874 --> 00:32:10,058
To snoop! Check!

593
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:12,041
The mistake was no mistake!

594
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:14,082
General Kaye had Stirling
assigned here by plan!

595
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:17,166
Very clever of him to send a
spy who looks and acts like...

596
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:18,749
Like a schlemiel!

597
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:20,916
Well, if it's fight
the old double-crosser wants,

598
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:23,041
we'll play his game his way!
How?

599
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:26,124
We'll try to keep Lieutenant
Stirling here! What?

600
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:28,416
General Kaye insists
we conduct our

601
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:30,374
field demonstration
with a full company.

602
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:32,624
But the morale status of
the Second Platoon is such

603
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:34,207
that it leaves us
only one course,

604
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:35,957
to leave them out
of the operation!

605
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:38,082
But you said he'd raise
an awful holler!

606
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,499
Not if we can blame the condition
of that platoon on a man,

607
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,207
his man!

608
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:45,874
Send him in!

609
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,041
Lieutenant!

610
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,999
At ease.

611
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:04,975
Well, Lieutenant, it seems
we have a mutual friend.

612
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,457
Oh, do we? I didn't know.
General Kaye.

613
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,624
Oh, no, I think you're
mistaken, ma'am.

614
00:33:09,707 --> 00:33:11,058
At least, I don't
know him personally.

615
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:14,541
Well, you knew he was coming here to
review a camouflage demonstration.

616
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,541
Yeah. Well, I, uh, I didn't
think there was any harm.

617
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:20,124
[, uh, I did happen to mention
to Captain Parker that...

618
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,957
Then you did get the
word from General Kaye?

619
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,457
Oh, no, ma'am. I got it from...

620
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,707
Uh, well, you
wouldn't believe me.

621
00:33:25,957 --> 00:33:27,957
Don't tell me you
got it from that mule?

622
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:30,291
Why, yes. How did you know?

623
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:35,332
Strangely enough, Lieutenant,
your answer quite satisfies me.

624
00:33:35,957 --> 00:33:38,291
(CHUCKLING) Oh, well. Oh, fine!
(CHUCKLES)

625
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:40,933
Lieutenant Stirling,
I have decided to make you

626
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:43,957
the camouflage instructor for
the Second Platoon of Company C.

627
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,707
Oh, well, I...

628
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,249
Me, an instructor for...
For a WAC platoon?

629
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,475
I'm sure, since you're a man,
you won't have any trouble

630
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:51,933
whipping 'em into shape.

631
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:54,957
Congratulations, Lieutenant
Stirling, and good luck!

632
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,957
Man coming! (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

634
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,957
Attention!

635
00:34:12,874 --> 00:34:13,957
At ease.

636
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,416
Some of you women may be aware

637
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:18,166
that we were to be
joined by an officer

638
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:20,541
with experience in
combat conditions.

639
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:24,166
Through some error, Lieutenant
Stirling was assigned.

640
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,499
Until he is transferred,
he will undertake duties

641
00:34:26,582 --> 00:34:28,892
as your platoon
camouflage instructor.

642
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,916
A man in the WAC? What is this?
That's for me!

643
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:34,707
Take orders from a man?
But he's so cute.

644
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,791
Well, Lieutenant,
they're all yours.

645
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:40,291
Take over.

646
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:46,916
(CLEARS THROAT)

647
00:34:49,374 --> 00:34:51,041
I just don't believe it!

648
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:53,916
Well, it's true! Now, uh...

649
00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:55,957
I'm supposed to whip
you girls into shape!

650
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:58,249
You're supposed to what?

651
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:01,874
Well, uh, that's right, I'm supposed
to whip you girls into shape!

652
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,041
Now I want order
and I want discipline.

653
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,124
There will be no
shirking of duty!

654
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:08,624
Now, when I say "fall out,”
I mean "fall out”!

655
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:09,850
And when it comes
time to fall out,

656
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,582
we fall out and very fast!
Fall out now, fast!

657
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:15,332

658
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:21,041

I said, at ease.
I am at ease, sir.

on the ball, right?

Right. Right.

ready to buck for rear admiral.

700
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:30,207
Gee, I'm sorry, Francis.
Is there anything I can do?

701
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,832
I've often wondered.

702
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:34,207
I can take anything
they can dish out.

703
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,725
Well, I think we're
both getting a bad deal.

704
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:36,874
I am officially in the WACs.

705
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,749
Heaven help the WACs.

706
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:40,457
Now, this is no time to joke.

707
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,166
What're we gonna do? I can't
get any place with those girls.

708
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:45,666
Maybe they're a little choosey.
Yeah.

709
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:46,726
Oh, you know what I mean.

710
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,457
I've brushed up on my
manual of arms. Yeah.

711
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,683
My close order drill. Yeah.

712
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:51,957
Et cetera, et cetera. That
should endear you to them.

713
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:53,374
Psst! Psst!

714
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:56,707
Uh-oh! Here comes old aspirin tablet.
Yeah. Who? Who?

715
00:37:57,332 --> 00:38:00,291
(LAUGHS) Have you
got a surprise coming.

716
00:38:00,374 --> 00:38:01,707
Oh, boy.

717
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:04,791
Oh.

718
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:07,707
Good morning, you
dear little animals!

719
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,457
Here's some breakfast,
you horrid little things.

720
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:12,749
(SQUEAKING)

721
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,957
Oh, Aunt and Uncle Wiggly,

722
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:17,957
a big fat carrot for you.

723
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,082
And Rosalind.

724
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:25,707
Look what nursie
brought you, a banana.

725
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:30,207
Well, then you eat it later.
Just take it and eat it later.

726
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,874
Peggy, look what I brought you.

727
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:37,457
Some nice, fresh peanuts.

728
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,832
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Oh, good morning, Lieutenant.

729
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:41,332
Here's some...

730
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,166
Oh, no. No, you couldn't be.

731
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,457
No, I'm not! I'm not!
Honestly, I'm not!

732
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:52,642
No, I mean, uh,
one I met in Burma.

733
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,624
It was in a psychopathic ward.
Huh?

734
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,642
Oh, but that, that was somebody
else entirely. (BOTH CHUCKLE)

735
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:59,124
Yes, he was always weaving baskets.
Is that so?

736
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:01,041
Crazy as a loon,
huh? A real idiot?

737
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:03,541
Oh, the cutest little
idiot you ever saw.

738
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:05,416
Well. Oh? He talked to a mule.

739
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:08,249
So of course, you couldn't...
Oh, no, I couldn't. (CHUCKLES)

740
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:13,332
Oh, dear.

741
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:19,832
Uh, this mule isn't a
friend of yours, is he?

742
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,916
(LAUGHING) Of course not.

743
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,166
I just came in to see the monkeys.
Well,

744
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,832
no insinuations implied, Lieutenant.
Of course not. No.

745
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:34,749
Let's see. You poor,
dumb little beast.

746
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:37,124
No reaction whatsoever.

747
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,624
Here, let's take
your temperature.

748
00:39:44,374 --> 00:39:46,582
Well, now there.
Now, stick it in.

749
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:49,082
Stick it in that dear little
mouth of yours. Up, up.

750
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,582
There you go.

751
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:51,624
Oh!

752
00:39:53,082 --> 00:39:54,582
For pity's sakes.

753
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,541
No brains, no feeling.

754
00:39:57,832 --> 00:39:59,332
She shouldn't have said that.

755
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:02,582
He drank a whole bottle
of alcohol yesterday!

756
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:06,291
Now, you dear little mule, I'm
gonna start you on your pills.

757
00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:08,624
I hope you take them nicely.

758
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:15,707
No, I...

759
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:22,166
The old battle axe.

760
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:27,416
Pills. Takes a pill
to know a pill! Mmm.

761
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:29,332
Remember that old saddle bag?
Yeah.

762
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,216
Lieutenant Valerie Humpert.
Do I remember her?

763
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:32,249
Burma. Yeah.

764
00:40:32,332 --> 00:40:33,683
She nursed me through four
sieges of basket weaving!

765
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:34,808
Uh-huh. Look, things
are getting worse.

766
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,058
We've just gotta get outta here.
Check!

767
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:37,749
And your old cousin has a plan!

768
00:40:37,832 --> 00:40:40,517
I knew you'd come up with something.
Natch. Now, get this.

769
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:41,791
Peel a WAC and you got a woman.

770
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:45,291
Rank or file, they're females
first and last! Right? I guess so.

771
00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:47,832
All right. You can't win a
woman unless you woo her.

772
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,749
A whole platoon? You want me to
woo a whole platoon? Precisely!

773
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:52,749
Yeah, but I'm not very strong.

774
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:55,416
Have you got 30 bucks? Why?

775
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:57,749
Well, there's a special
sale on cologne at the PX.

776
00:40:57,832 --> 00:40:58,957
Cologne?

777
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:03,374
It's called, "Night
In the Casbah."

778
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,517
"Night In The Casbah"? You
mean for the entire platoon?

779
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:07,041
But of course!

780
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:09,416
You are such a boy!

781
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:11,374
Now get goin' and check with me!

782
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:15,457
Woo a whole platoon?
That's 25 to one.

783
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,499
You're the odds-on favorite!

784
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,416
Eh-eh.

785
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:22,916
Uh-oh.

786
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:26,999
Oh, no, not that!

787
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:34,791
(SIGHS) Now you must take your
pill, you naughty little mule!

788
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:38,475
Take this great big pill,
now! Open wide!

789
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,124
Up with the little mouth.

790
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,499
Now, that's right!
Put it in for nursie.

791
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:45,749
There, now. Just one big blow.

792
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:49,457
(SNORTING) (COUGHING)

793
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:52,374
You all right, Lieutenant?
You... You all right?

794
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:58,957
Oh, Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

795
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:06,207
What's this "Night
In The Casbah" bit?

796
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,582
Huh? Oh. It's just a gift!

797
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:11,749
Are you as innocent as you look?

798
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:13,791
Well, I really had an
ulterior motive, you see,

799
00:42:13,874 --> 00:42:15,433
I want you girls to like me.

800
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:19,332
You mean... You mean you gave
cologne to everybody in the platoon?

801
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:21,332
Well, yeah. Don't you like it?

802
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:23,457
(LAUGHING) I think
it's wonderful.

803
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:27,082
You know, if I had a kid brother
I'd like him to be just like you!

804
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,749
(CHUCKLES) I... No...

805
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,541
Oh, Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
(WHISTLES)

806
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:39,499
Oh, thank you
so much! Thank you!

807
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:41,124
(CHUCKLES)

808
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:44,416
(CHUCKLING) (WHISTLING)

809
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:46,624
Oh, Lieutenant!

810
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:49,416
You shouldn't have! Now, mmm...

811
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:57,457
Now, Corporal Hilstrom,
this is against regulations.

812
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:02,832
Sorry, Captain. It was
just a slip of the lip.

813
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,392
Well, I expect you to be
more careful next time!

814
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:07,541
Yes, ma'am!

815
00:43:07,624 --> 00:43:09,582
I'll be extra careful next time.

816
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:12,916
Lieutenant Stirling. Yes, ma'am?

817
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,416
You were out of order. Well, yes. My aim...
My aim is better discipline!

818
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:19,767
You'd sound a little more convincing if
you wiped that lip rouge off your mouth.

819
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,457
Of course. (CHUCKLES)

820
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:24,374
I... You know, that Corporal
Hilstrom took me by surprise.

821
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:27,082
Your life seems to be
full of surprises!

822
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:34,041
Oh, Lieutenant!

823
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,707
(ALL GIGGLING)

824
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,249
How do you figure that?

825
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:50,350
Lieutenant Stirling seems
to be trying awfully hard.

826
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:51,957
Lieutenant Stirling!

827
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,166
There's more to this
than meets the eye!

828
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:02,041
One, two, three, four,
to the left flank, march!

829
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:05,957
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

830
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,541
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.

831
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:11,874
To the rear, march!

832
00:44:12,332 --> 00:44:14,166
One, two... Lift those legs.

833
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:15,916
Lift those lovely, lovely legs!

834
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,332
And away we go
to the rear, march!

835
00:44:19,374 --> 00:44:21,374
To the rear, march.

836
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:23,041
Lift those legs!

837
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,041
You're doin' great,
you beautiful dolls!

838
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:27,291
Embarrassing! Very embarrassing!

839
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,749
Well, don't you think Lieutenant
Stirling is to be commended?

840
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:31,957
For what? Double-crossing us?

841
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,308
He lifted that Second Platoon
right out of their slump!

842
00:44:34,332 --> 00:44:35,957
And made us a
target for ridicule.

843
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,332
What do you think General
Kaye will say about this?

844
00:44:38,457 --> 00:44:40,308
A man helped us out!

845
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:42,541
We couldn't do it
but a man could!

846
00:44:42,957 --> 00:44:44,832
PETER: Lift those
lovely, lovely legs.

847
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:51,267
Ma'am, General Kaye is waiting
for you at Battalion Headquarters.

848
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:54,291
General Kaye? But he isn't
due in until tomorrow.

849
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:56,332
PETER: Lift those
lovely, lovely legs!

850
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:59,166
I'm going to settle that Lieutenant
Stirling's hash right now!

851
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:00,874
See you later!

852
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:06,541
KAYE: Major, you might think
that I'm a stubborn mule.

853
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:08,267
Just because a few of your women

854
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,624
have developed into adequate
camouflage specialists,

855
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,267
it doesn't mean that you can
flood the service with them.

856
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,124
We've known each other
a long time, General,

857
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:16,767
and I... I'd even
like to think of us as

858
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:17,957
being good friends, Louise,

859
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,916
but these wild ideas of yours...

860
00:45:19,957 --> 00:45:22,957
Ben, may I have your permission
to speak freely? Yeah.

861
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:25,600
Just because you believe women are
fit only to be typewriter jockeys

862
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:27,291
and telephone operators
doesn't mean that

863
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:29,124
national defense
should be jeopardized!

864
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:30,308
We've done pretty
well up to now.

865
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:31,957
You only have to do badly once.
Louise,

866
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:35,249
you've got a one-track mind and I
consider it my duty to prove you're wrong.

867
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:37,916
And I find your methods as
misguided as your views.

868
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:39,416
My methods are beyond reproach!

869
00:45:39,499 --> 00:45:41,957
I've gone to great lengths to
arrange this demonstration.

870
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,791
You've gone to even greater lengths
to disrupt our morale and snoop!

871
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:45,874
And what?

872
00:45:45,957 --> 00:45:47,642
Why haven't you approved
Lieutenant Stirling's

873
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:49,499
transfer out of this
WAC assignment?

874
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:51,624
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

875
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,249
Who is this Lieutenant Stirling?

876
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:55,249
And why should you
want her transferred?

877
00:45:55,332 --> 00:45:57,707
Lieutenant Stirling is not a her!
It's a him. A him?

878
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,916
As if you didn't know! Here?

879
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,416
Yes! A Mata Hari
in men's clothing!

880
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,874
Sent here to carry out his
general's orders! General!

881
00:46:07,207 --> 00:46:09,916
Ben, there are many things on
which we don't see eye to eye,

882
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:13,183
but up to now I have never questioned
your ethics or sportsmanship.

883
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,167
Now, Louise, if you'll simmer...
But the mere fact

884
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,183
that you had to stoop to
this sort of procedure

885
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,999
to try and beat us
is proof of our

886
00:46:19,082 --> 00:46:20,874
superior skill and ability.

887
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,749
Major, it might be
a good idea for you

888
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:24,975
to use some of your smart
camouflaging on that sharp tongue

889
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:27,124
when you're addressing
a superior officer.

890
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,291
I'm sorry, Louise.

891
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:33,166
This is the first I've
heard about all this.

892
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,207
Naturally, if there's been a
mistake, I'll rectify it at once.

893
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,082
Thank you.

894
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:43,183
Now about the
demonstration, I've, uh,

895
00:46:43,207 --> 00:46:47,416
selected Piney Woods as the area of
operation, if this is acceptable to you.

896
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,332
A male WAC,

897
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:53,166
how about that?

898
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,707
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

899
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:59,142
Just think, in a couple of days
we might be out of this mess.

900
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:01,874
You're sure your transfer
is going through?

901
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:04,142
Well, Corporal Hilstrom
heard it from Captain Parker

902
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,999
and Captain Parker got
it from Major Simpson.

903
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:09,166
Happy day. I couldn't
stand much more.

904
00:47:09,624 --> 00:47:12,166
What Headquarters is
doing to my hindquarters

905
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:14,541
shouldn't happen In any quarter.

906
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,624
You know, it's gonna be
hard saying goodbye. Yeah?

907
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:20,291
Francis? Huh?

908
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:23,142
Do you think it's possible for a guy
to be in love with a whole platoon?

909
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,666
Never heard of it outside
the Marine Corps.

910
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:28,791
Once knew a Marine who was
engaged to three women.

911
00:47:28,957 --> 00:47:30,291
Yeah? What did he do about it?

912
00:47:30,374 --> 00:47:32,124
They buried him in Arlington.

913
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,124
Sharpened his heels and drove him in.
(CHUCKLES)

914
00:47:35,624 --> 00:47:37,041
Shh. Shh.

915
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:46,124
Attention!

916
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,457
Come on, Francis.
No games. I'm tired.

917
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:50,791
Attention!

918
00:47:51,124 --> 00:47:53,957
Now quit making like a
general, you idiot. (HISSING)

919
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:57,166
Idiot, am I? I could have you
broken for this, Lieutenant!

920
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,957
(LAUGHS)

921
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,624
A jackass break a lieutenant?

922
00:48:00,707 --> 00:48:02,707
Heh, that's a laugh. (CHUCKLES)

923
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,666
Yes, it's a real yuk.

924
00:48:04,874 --> 00:48:06,166
On your feet!

925
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:17,749
So you're Lieutenant Stirling?

926
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:19,957
(STUTTERING) Uh, yes, sir.

927
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,058
Looks like we're gettin' kinda
close to the bottom of the barrel.

928
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:23,166
Yes, sir. Hmm.

929
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:25,457
See we hit the Burma front together.
Yeah?

930
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,058
I'm General Kaye.
Oh, how do you do, sir.

931
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:29,957
At ease, Lieutenant.
(STAMMERING) At ease, sir?

932
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,124
I know how you feel,

933
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:34,916
coming out of a man's army and
being pushed in with these Suzies.

934
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:37,041
A male WAC! Yes, sir.

935
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:38,416
I hear your little tour of duty

936
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,419
has thrown the ladies into a tizzy.
Uh, yes, sir.

937
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,624
Uh, no, sir! Well, I
try to do my duty, sir.

938
00:48:42,707 --> 00:48:45,249
So I hear, and that's what
I want to talk to you about.

939
00:48:45,332 --> 00:48:48,457
Just between us, Stirling, I
don't think you should overdo it.

940
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,332
Huh? I don't understand, sir.

941
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:54,499
Well, women just don't appreciate
a man's superior skill and ability.

942
00:48:54,582 --> 00:48:56,017
Oh, yes, sir. Oh, not that
it would matter, sir.

943
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,433
I'm not gonna be with
them much longer.

944
00:48:57,457 --> 00:48:59,666
I'm being transferred
out. I think.

945
00:48:59,749 --> 00:49:03,041
Am I not, sir? Yes, of course, my boy.
Of course.

946
00:49:03,082 --> 00:49:04,999
Might take a little time.

947
00:49:05,624 --> 00:49:08,082
I suppose this was a
little advance celebration?

948
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:10,041
Oh, yes, sir. Me and Francis.

949
00:49:10,582 --> 00:49:11,832
Francis?

950
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,041
Who's she?

951
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:15,707
Oh, she is a he.
Uh, he is a mule.

952
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:17,791
Uh, that that's him
over there, sir.

953
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:20,166
Celebratin' with a mule?
Hmm. Yes, sir.

954
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:25,957
Personally, I would've selected
a sweeter smellin' companion.

955
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:27,457
One not so dumb.

956
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:30,416
Yeah, but he's a pretty smart mule, sir.
That I doubt.

957
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:33,291
He reminds me of one
I had in my command.

958
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:35,582
We had just built a temporary
bridge on the Burma Road,

959
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,916
and this stubborn
creature refused to cross.

960
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:40,124
Held up the whole company.
We never did get across it.

961
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,749
Never? No. The bridge collapsed

962
00:49:41,832 --> 00:49:44,999
before our very eyes into a
raging, storm-swollen river.

963
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,916
Well, maybe he was
pretty smart, sir.

964
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:48,416
No. Not this one.

965
00:49:48,749 --> 00:49:50,749
He was just ornery, stupid.

966
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:52,999
Dumbest animal I ever saw.

967
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:56,791
Well, I'll leave you to
your little celebration.

968
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:57,957
Yes, sir.

969
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:00,291
Uh-huh.

970
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,374
Get him!

971
00:50:04,957 --> 00:50:06,582
Come back here, Pete!

972
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:12,374
I wish you'd make up your mind!
I'm so mad,

973
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:16,457
I could blow a gasket! Naturally,
I wouldn't cross that bridge.

974
00:50:16,957 --> 00:50:18,933
You mean that mule was you?

975
00:50:18,957 --> 00:50:21,416
Anybody could see the
pulley system was faulty,

976
00:50:21,499 --> 00:50:23,416
the bridge was
bound to collapse.

977
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:25,791
Francis, you saved
the whole company.

978
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:28,499
Yeah, but our hero
got a commendation.

979
00:50:28,957 --> 00:50:33,416
Never mentioned me. "Ornery,
stupid." The old goat.

980
00:50:33,499 --> 00:50:36,624
Yeah, yeah, but I don't understand.
Now... Now his voice

981
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:38,291
sounds exactly like yours.

982
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:40,832
It was along about
then I decided

983
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,541
it would be handy
to be able to talk,

984
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:45,144
particularly like a general, and
as long as I was in his outfit,

985
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:46,933
it was a built-in goldbrick.

986
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:48,874
Well, it sounds like
nothin' but trouble.

987
00:50:48,957 --> 00:50:50,374
Am I glad we're
getting out of this!

988
00:50:50,457 --> 00:50:52,933
But we're not getting out.
No. Yeah.

989
00:50:52,957 --> 00:50:54,791
What're you saying?
We gotta get out of this!

990
00:50:54,957 --> 00:50:56,166
Hmm, Petey, my boy,

991
00:50:56,249 --> 00:50:58,916
we're gonna stay long
enough to teach that old...

992
00:50:59,082 --> 00:51:01,416
Well, we're gonna
teach him a lesson!

993
00:51:01,499 --> 00:51:02,624
Oh, no, now you can't!

994
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:05,457
Oh, you're going to become
a camouflage expert.

995
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:08,332
Not me, I refuse. I just plain refuse!
Let me see,

996
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:11,166
the operation will take
place at Piney Woods.

997
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,624
Now, we need a map of that area.

998
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:17,207
Not me! Now you leave me out of this.
I don't want anything to do with maps.

999
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:20,124
Naturally, this
is top secret, Pete.

1000
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:22,291
Major Simpson won't
even tell Company C

1001
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:24,041
what route they're
going to follow.

1002
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:26,374
Not until the night
before the operation.

1003
00:51:26,957 --> 00:51:28,916
Now, starting from Point Able...

1004
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:31,916
Yeah, that's it.

1005
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,624
Company C, to be
called the White Army,

1006
00:51:34,707 --> 00:51:36,017
is going to try to
move a distance

1007
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,291
of 10 miles to Point Baker.

1008
00:51:39,249 --> 00:51:41,874
You see it there? Atta boy.

1009
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:45,124
That is, without being spotted
by General Kaye's Blue Army.

1010
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,541
Both these points will be
known to us and the umpire,

1011
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:50,457
but not to the Blue Army.

1012
00:51:51,124 --> 00:51:54,874
Starting tomorrow, Company C goes
into training on a 24-hour basis.

1013
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:58,332
Yeah, well, Francis, what do I
know about... You'll learn, my boy.

1014
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,791
Yes, sir, you'll learn.

1015
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,832
Did you deploy your
troops so they can

1016
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:07,249
be identified and
signaled immediately? Huh?

1017
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,874
Yes. All right. Show me.
Show me.

1018
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,957
Reverse, move!

1019
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:27,832
I said move! Oh, there you are.

1020
00:52:28,832 --> 00:52:31,374
Oh, my aching back!

1021
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:02,291
(SCREAMS)

1022
00:53:02,374 --> 00:53:04,749
Oh, a moose!

1023
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,749
Calm down, boy. That's
just an object lesson.

1024
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:10,291
Camouflage can be offensive
as well as defensive.

1025
00:53:10,374 --> 00:53:13,457
I just wanted to drive that
point through your head!

1026
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:15,767
You sure took the long way through.
Mmm-hmm.

1027
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,707
Parker! JANE: Oh, good morning.

1028
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:21,350
Jane, did you take
the topographical map

1029
00:53:21,374 --> 00:53:22,791
of Piney Woods from my desk?

1030
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,767
Well, I wouldn't do that
without your permission, Louise.

1031
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,207
Well, someone did. It's gone!

1032
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:28,916
And if that map ever gets into
the wrong hands... Wrong hands!

1033
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:31,041
Oh, you don't think General
Kaye would go that far?

1034
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,749
I think he'd do anything
to prevent our success,

1035
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:35,541
him and his male WAC, I...

1036
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:38,791
That's who it was. Stirling!

1037
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:43,416
It must have been our
dear little lieutenant.

1038
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,749
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

1039
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:53,582
As you were.

1040
00:53:53,749 --> 00:53:56,624
I won't beat about the bush,
I want that map! What map?

1041
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:58,725
The map to Piney Woods,
as if you didn't know,

1042
00:53:58,749 --> 00:53:59,933
and don't tell me you lost it!

1043
00:53:59,957 --> 00:54:02,677
Oh, no, ma'am. I've got it. Not that
it would matter, I memorized it!

1044
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:07,124
Lieutenant, report to Battalion
Headquarters immediately.

1045
00:54:07,207 --> 00:54:09,725
Go there directly.
Do not speak to anyone!

1046
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:12,332
Yes, ma'am. I mean yes, sir.
I mean, I mean, yes.

1047
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:16,666
Nothing, but nothing must
jeopardize the operation.

1048
00:54:17,082 --> 00:54:19,725
Obviously, if he went to the
trouble of memorizing the map,

1049
00:54:19,749 --> 00:54:22,374
the information on it has not
yet gotten to General Kaye.

1050
00:54:22,457 --> 00:54:24,291
I'm going to see
that it never does.

1051
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:25,791
Send Lieutenant Stirling in.

1052
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:30,124
Lieutenant Stirling.

1053
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,707
Sit down!

1054
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:52,183
Lieutenant, I want to know what...
It's not true.

1055
00:54:52,207 --> 00:54:54,166
I'm innocent. I'm not
on General Kaye's side.

1056
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,916
We want you WACs to win. Yeah, we.
"We," Lieutenant Stirling?

1057
00:54:56,957 --> 00:54:58,624
I mean, I. I see.

1058
00:54:58,707 --> 00:55:00,933
Oh, no, no, you don't see. Honestly...
I see the map you stole.

1059
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:02,207
I didn't steal any map.

1060
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:04,166
Somebody did. It was borrowed.

1061
00:55:04,249 --> 00:55:05,475
Francis wouldn't steal anything.

1062
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:07,582
Francis? Who's Francis?
Francis, he's...

1063
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:09,457
Oh, you wouldn't believe me.

1064
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:12,082
Don't tell me you're going to
go into that mule routine again!

1065
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,624
Yes, ma'am.

1066
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:16,642
All right, so there's a mule.

1067
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:19,374
A mule named Francis.
Yes. Spelled with an "I."

1068
00:55:19,457 --> 00:55:22,207
Just an ordinary mule? Oh,
no, he's not an ordinary mule.

1069
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:25,374
A mule walked into my office
to borrow a map? Yes, ma'am.

1070
00:55:25,832 --> 00:55:27,874
How do you know he did?
He told me.

1071
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,499
Oh, yes, I forgot.
He talks, too.

1072
00:55:30,582 --> 00:55:31,642
Yeah.

1073
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:34,874
Well, I know it sounds impossible, why,
I didn't believe it myself at one time.

1074
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,791
But now you do believe he can talk?
I know it!

1075
00:55:37,874 --> 00:55:41,541
And you're willing to stand by
that story, Lieutenant? Definitely!

1076
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:44,874
Good! It makes what I have
to do that much simpler.

1078

I swear, it's...

00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,666
I swear it's the truth!

1080
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:52,374
Don't you worry about a thing.

1081
00:55:52,457 --> 00:55:54,541
We've been through this
before, Lieutenant.

1082
00:55:54,624 --> 00:55:56,017
Yeah, and I don't want
to go through it again.

1083
00:55:56,041 --> 00:56:00,082
Just like old times, they're
using our treatments again.

1084
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:01,707
Good afternoon, nurse.

1085
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:07,207
And how's our patient? Oh, just dandy.
Just dandy.

1086
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:10,874
Do you still think a mule talks to you?
He certainly does!

1087
00:56:10,957 --> 00:56:12,916
You don't have to answer
for Lieutenant Stirling.

1088
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:14,791
You're asking our questions.

1089
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:18,041
That's all. That's all.
Yes, you were asking...

1090
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,749
Well, I...

1091
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:25,166
Oh, yes. Mmm.

1092
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:28,207
I'll be right outside, Lieutenant.
(CLEARING THROAT)

Now, this heavy dark mass
represents your mother.

1094
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:38,666
My mother was a skinny blonde.

1095
00:56:38,957 --> 00:56:41,041
You said Francis was
like a mother to you.

1096
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:42,964
Oh, no, I said Francis
was like a father to me.

1097
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:45,416
He helps me and advises
me on everything.

1098
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:48,558
And you believe he could help
and advise you in this situation?

1099
00:56:48,582 --> 00:56:50,041
You mean you'll
let me talk to him?

1100
00:56:50,124 --> 00:56:51,499
I think it can be arranged.

1101
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:53,916
Oh, thank you very much, sir!
Thank you! That's really...

1102

I'm awfully sorry...

own dear brave little mule.

1105
00:57:04,249 --> 00:57:06,207
Oh, it hurts me worse
then it does you.

1106
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:08,874
Oh, we got to get

1108

and I'll fix your oatsies.

1109

Hmm, I'd like to
fix her oatsies.

1110

Hey!

1111
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:30,249
Hi, Francis.

1112
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:34,999
Uh, look, I know you're mad at
me but I had to tell the truth.

1113
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:38,957
Uh, did he answer you?

1114
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,791
No, he gets this way. Stubborn.
Look, I'm sorry, Francis.

1115
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:46,416
Oh, it's no use now.
He won't talk to me.

1116
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,582
No, I'm sure he won't.
Come, Lieutenant.

1117
00:57:48,707 --> 00:57:50,499
Now, no hard feelings, Francis.

Who?

sounded just like General Kaye.

Lieutenant Stirling. I...

1203
01:02:36,499 --> 01:02:38,874
What made you
suspect ventriloquism?

1204
01:02:38,957 --> 01:02:41,957
Well, for one thing,
he talked exactly like you.

1205
01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:43,457
Now wait a minute, Major.

1206
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:45,582
You may be a woman, but
you're also an Army officer

1207
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:47,183
and there's such
a thing a respect.

1208
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:48,416
But it's true.

1209
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:49,999
He talked exactly like you.

1210
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:51,082
Oh, Major.

1211
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:53,707
No insubordination
intended, believe me.

1212
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,416
If anyone's guilty
of such a thing,

1213
01:02:55,499 --> 01:02:56,707
it's your Lieutenant Stirling.

1214
01:02:56,749 --> 01:02:58,916
Why do you keep insinuating
I have something

1215
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:02,666
to do with this Lieutenant
Stirling and his talking mule?

1216
01:03:02,749 --> 01:03:04,183
Well, haven't you, General?

1217
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:07,666
I'll soon settle your mind on that.
Where is this Stirling?

1218
01:03:08,499 --> 01:03:11,207
In, uh, in the psycho ward.

1219
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,832
What? Well, where's the mule?

1220
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,183
In the barn.

1221
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:20,183
I can hardly believe this.
This is too normal.

1222
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:22,499
I'd like to have a look
at this mule.

1223
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:28,666
Hiya, Francis.

1224
01:03:28,707 --> 01:03:30,374
Beat it. Get lost.

1225
01:03:30,457 --> 01:03:32,207
I just had to sneak
out and apologize!

1226
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,832
Amscray, before
they find you here.

1227
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,517
I suppose you think I'm a
stupid idiot, don't you?

1228
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:39,142
With you, Pete, that's
par for the course!

1229
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:40,767
Yeah, but I just did
what you told me to do!

1230
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:43,142
I didn't tell you to
mess up the whole detail.

1231
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:46,142
You know how much it means to
me to win this old ballgame.

1232
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:48,457
Well, me too. Well,
we're out of the runnin'.

1233
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:50,832
And that ain't all. Have you
checked your platoon lately?

1234
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:52,166
How could I?

1235
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:54,124
They've fallen apart.

1236
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:55,832
But why? They were
doing so great.

1237
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,457
Morale, boy, morale. Yeah.

1238
01:03:58,749 --> 01:04:00,541
When they discovered
you were in psycho

1239
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:02,541
and they'd been gettin'
camouflage instruction

1240
01:04:02,624 --> 01:04:04,207
from a mental case, well...

1241
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,541
(DOOR OPENING) Shh. Shh. Pete.

1242
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:07,166
Hit the dirt.

1243
01:04:09,332 --> 01:04:10,499
It's over here, Ben.

1244
01:04:10,582 --> 01:04:12,874
Oh, I've had mules
in my outfit before.

1245
01:04:12,957 --> 01:04:15,124
None of 'em could ever talk.

1246
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:16,457
Yes.

1247
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:20,100
This is the beast I saw out
near the Confidence Course.

1248
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:22,124
Mangy lookin' creature.

1249
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:27,332
So, you're the
talking mule, huh?

1250
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:30,041
All right, talk it up.

1251
01:04:34,207 --> 01:04:37,124
This is all utter nonsense!

1252
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,249
What do you mean,
utter nonsense?

1253
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:42,374
(SNORTING)

1254
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,124
Hmm-hmm.

1255
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,999
Did you hear somethin'?
I heard you talk.

1256
01:04:54,082 --> 01:04:55,916
Well, so did I. Me?

1257
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:57,624
It was the mule.

1258
01:04:58,957 --> 01:05:01,957
Mule, did you say something?

1259
01:05:03,582 --> 01:05:05,082
Come on, speak up!

1260
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,457
Are you givin' me permission
to sound off, sir?

1261
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:12,749
Permission granted! Sound off!

1262
01:05:13,082 --> 01:05:14,207
Well, to start with,

1263
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:17,082
you're a narrow-minded
fuddy-duddy.

1264
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:19,100
You probably think the top brass

1265
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:22,058
is the machinery that
runs this man's army.

1266
01:05:22,082 --> 01:05:23,416
Horsefeathers!

1267
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:26,082
Now, you take these WACs.

1268
01:05:26,332 --> 01:05:29,666
Everyone knows that women are here to stay.
But not you.

1269
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:33,017
You've got the idea
they're in the service

1270
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:35,499
just to keep your
memos circulating.

1271
01:05:36,582 --> 01:05:38,957
This is the most ridiculous...

1272
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,041
Lieutenant Stirling.

1273
01:05:42,124 --> 01:05:43,541
KAYE: So, that's it.

1274
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:46,832
Huh! Just as we thought.
Ventriloquism.

1275
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:48,832
You were right, Louise.

1276
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:51,582
On your feet, Lieutenant!

1277
01:05:52,499 --> 01:05:55,017
A narrow-minded fuddy-duddy, huh?
Pig-headed, huh?

1278
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,100
Yeah, well, no, sir. If you
are, sir, I didn't say so, sir.

1279
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:58,332
Tell him, Francis.

1280
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,475
Tell him he's a narrow-minded,

1281
01:05:59,499 --> 01:06:01,017
pig-headed old fuddy-duddy.

1282
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,499
I mean, tell him you said so.

1283
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:03,725
I've heard enough
from this mule!

1284
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:05,017
You did give him permission
to sound off, sir.

1285
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,582
And I sure like the
sound he made, General.

1286
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:09,957
We won't discuss the
opinions of a sick mind.

1287
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,957
This boy needs medical care.

1288
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,916
Put him back in psycho where
he belongs and keep him there!

1289
01:06:18,999 --> 01:06:20,225
Now... Now look
what you've done!

1290
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:22,999
How could you do this
to me? How? Huh, how?

1291
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:35,332
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1292
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:49,933
Yes, Sergeant?

1293
01:06:49,957 --> 01:06:51,541
Leemy can't find
her helmet liner

1294
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:53,374
and Cassidy thinks
she's got a fever.

1295
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,707
If you ask me, your whole
platoon's dogging it.

1296
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:57,142
Well, we just haven't
been the same

1297
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:59,832
since we found out what happened
to poor Lieutenant Stirling.

1298
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:02,624
Don't you think you women are
carrying loyalty a little too far?

1299
01:07:03,582 --> 01:07:05,707
WOMAN: All right, girls.
Come on, now. Let's get busy!

1300
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:09,332
FRANCIS: (SOFTLY) Hey, Cutie.

1301
01:07:11,499 --> 01:07:12,874
Captain.

1302
01:07:13,582 --> 01:07:14,791
Come on over here.

1303
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:17,957
Come on. On the double.

1304
01:07:29,124 --> 01:07:30,957
Back of this truck.

1305
01:07:36,749 --> 01:07:38,582
Hey, Captain.

1306
01:07:38,999 --> 01:07:40,457
Back here.

1307
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,916
Oh, don't be frightened.

1308
01:07:52,499 --> 01:07:53,892
Relax.

1309
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:57,249
The next voice you hear
is mine and nobody else's.

1310
01:07:57,332 --> 01:07:58,624
Yeah.

1311
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,707
The trouble with you, babe, is
that you look like a hot tamale

1312
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:03,832
and act like a frozen custard.

1313
01:08:04,207 --> 01:08:06,874
Do you know the best thing
that could happen to you?

1314
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,291
Don't answer that.

1315
01:08:08,374 --> 01:08:10,624
Lose those captain's bars
for a couple hours!

1316
01:08:10,707 --> 01:08:13,082
Act like a woman.
Break a few rules.

1317
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:16,291
You like Pete, don't you? Yeah.

1318
01:08:16,582 --> 01:08:19,541
And you want to believe that
he's on your side! Yeah!

1319
01:08:19,707 --> 01:08:20,850
Well, he is.

1320
01:08:20,874 --> 01:08:22,624
What's more, he could
help this operation.

1321
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:25,874
He could pull that Second Platoon
right into line again. Check?

1322
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:28,332
Well, what're you waitin' for?

1323
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:31,707
Bust him outta that nuthouse
and let's put him into action.

1324
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:32,999
Get goin'.

1325
01:08:34,082 --> 01:08:35,291
(CHUCKLES)

1326
01:08:35,374 --> 01:08:36,624
Typical.

1327
01:08:36,707 --> 01:08:39,749
Once those icebergs melt,
there ain't no stopping 'em.

1328
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:45,707
Can I help you, Captain?

1329
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,624
I'd like to see Lieutenant
Stirling, please.

1330
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,582
Uh, in... In here, ma'am.

1331
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:52,041
Oh, thank you.

1332
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,499
Lieutenant Stirling.
Just a minute...

1333
01:09:04,582 --> 01:09:05,808
Well, Captain Parker!

1334
01:09:05,832 --> 01:09:08,791
I want to apologize. I know now
it's all a horrible mistake.

1335
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:10,017
Oh, well, it's not
so horrible now.

1336
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,249
Captain, the Lieutenant
is a very sick man.

1337
01:09:12,332 --> 01:09:15,041
Oh, he's no sicker than I am.
And he's got a job to do!

1338
01:09:15,124 --> 01:09:16,166
Your platoon needs you,

1339
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:18,142
and that means the camouflage
operation needs you.

1340
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:20,582
But he's a man! He's also a WAC!

1341
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:22,957
Lieutenant Stirling, I want
you to join your platoon.

1342
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,808
Captain, that's against orders.

1343
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:26,124
Orders! This is war!

1344
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:28,166
And you're in the army,
too, Lieutenant Humpert.

1345
01:09:28,249 --> 01:09:30,457
And tomorrow we'll be fighting
your battle out there.

1346
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,541
But it is against orders.

1347
01:09:33,124 --> 01:09:34,791
Lieutenant...

1348
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:37,957
What do you say?

1349
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:40,041
Well, it's orders are orders,

1350
01:09:40,124 --> 01:09:42,791
and you heard me tell
the captain, orders.

1351
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:44,916
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

1352
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:46,291
Well!

1353
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:49,124
What you want me to do?
Just anything!

1354
01:09:49,207 --> 01:09:50,874
Well, we've got to
smuggle him out of here

1355
01:09:50,957 --> 01:09:52,707
past that guard.

1356
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:56,291
Hey, you could lend
him your uniform.

1357
01:09:56,374 --> 01:09:58,054
Why, yes. You could lend me...
Her uniform?

1358
01:09:58,124 --> 01:09:59,332
A woman's uniform?

1359
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:00,457
He's a WAC, isn't he?

1360
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:02,142
Oh, now wait. Things are going
just a little bit too far.

1361
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:03,666
Well, you want to
help us, don't you?

1362
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:04,767
(STAMMERS) Well, yeah, but I...

1363
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:06,249
Lieutenant, all those
women need you.

1364
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:08,332
Uh, really? Well, I...

1365
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:09,767
Quick! You've got
to get undressed!

1366
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:10,768
Undressed? Yes. Yes!

1367
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:12,767
Well, how much of my uniform?

1368
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,916
Uh, do you think just
the outside would do?

1369
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:17,374
Well, I'm afraid what I've
got to put inside won't do!

1370
01:10:17,457 --> 01:10:19,791
Hurry. We haven't got much time.

1371
01:10:19,874 --> 01:10:21,249

cold, I'm gonna blame you.

getting in these things, that's all.

for hair on your new sister WAC?

That's right. We've got to
fake a wig out of something.

Get the scissors.

to have him back.

through for us tomorrow

with one of theirs.

LIEUTENANT: Which way, soldier?

1544
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:03,225
FRED: Well they must've come this way, sir.
We found a girl's comb.

1545
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:05,832
Show him the comb, George.
GEORGE: Here you are, sir.

1546
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:07,957
FRED: It's about time those
WACs let down their hair

1547
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:10,457
and gave us some
kind of a clue, sir.

1548
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:12,582
LIEUTENANT: It might be a decoy,

1549
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,791
but I think we'd better
contact field headquarters

1550
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:16,957
and see if it fits in
with the plot map.

1551
01:21:17,124 --> 01:21:18,124
Okay, let's go.

1552
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,666
Wait a minute, sir.
My walkie-talkie.

1553
01:21:41,082 --> 01:21:44,082
Help! Help! They got me!

1554
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,082
Well, what do you know?
We hooked the wrong fish.

1555
01:21:47,624 --> 01:21:50,332
Francis! Francis, get
me outta here, will ya?

1556
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:54,041
Shh. Easy does it. There.

1557
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:00,916
Lieutenant! Two patrols
are approaching.

1558
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,082
What?

1559
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,058
That's nice work, Lieutenant.

1560
01:22:06,082 --> 01:22:07,082
Thanks.

1561
01:22:07,499 --> 01:22:09,041
Mission accomplished.

1562
01:22:09,082 --> 01:22:11,457
Yeah, and two enemy
patrols are approaching.

1563
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:13,457
Aah! Come on, let's go!

1564
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:15,957
Aw... Aren't you coming with me?

1565
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:18,582
No, I've gotta untangle
this mess you made.

1566
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:20,582
Gimme that hearin' aid.

1567
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:23,124
Come on. Hmm-mmm.

1568
01:22:24,249 --> 01:22:27,017
Oh, hello all units.

1569
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:29,916
This is Blue,
Field Command to patrols.

1570
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:31,041
General Kaye.

1571
01:22:31,124 --> 01:22:34,499
Charlie Patrol proceed south
by southeast. Be alert.

1572
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:37,374
Opposing forces
are wearing men's uniforms.

1573
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:41,874
Calling Dog Patrol.

1574
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,291
Calling Dog Patrol.

1575
01:22:44,374 --> 01:22:45,416
It's General Kaye.

1576
01:22:45,499 --> 01:22:48,166
Dog Patrol, proceed
north by northwest.

1577
01:22:48,249 --> 01:22:49,374
Be alert.

1578
01:22:49,457 --> 01:22:52,041
Opposing forces
are wearing men's uniforms.

1579
01:23:09,624 --> 01:23:10,957
Stand by, over.

1580
01:23:10,999 --> 01:23:12,374
I gave no such orders.

1581
01:23:12,457 --> 01:23:14,374
You know I gave no such orders.

1582
01:23:14,457 --> 01:23:15,957
Tell them that...

1583
01:23:16,957 --> 01:23:18,374
That's it.

1584
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:21,082
The White Army's tuned
in on our frequency.

1585
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:23,957
They're giving commands
and intercepting ours.

1586
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,416
Yeah.

1587
01:23:25,707 --> 01:23:27,957
This is our first bit of luck.

1588
01:23:28,957 --> 01:23:32,874
Corporal, we're going to
give those WACs some orders

1589
01:23:32,957 --> 01:23:34,037
that will cook their goose.

1590
01:23:34,082 --> 01:23:35,124
Yes, sir.

1591
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:37,957
Hey, Pete, give this
thing a listen, quick.

1592
01:23:38,374 --> 01:23:39,707
MAN: Attention all patrols.

1593
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:41,933
Mmm-hmm. This is Unit Blue.

1594
01:23:41,957 --> 01:23:44,933
The White Army is now
bracketed in Zone Twelve.

1595
01:23:44,957 --> 01:23:48,582
Deploy east and west
of Hill 1-1-8 to intercept.

1596
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:49,666
FRANCIS: Oh.

1597
01:23:49,749 --> 01:23:51,933
That... That must be
this hill right here.

1598
01:23:51,957 --> 01:23:53,957
Hey, look, it's not covered!

1599
01:23:54,332 --> 01:23:56,791
He probably figured we'd never
dare cross it, too exposed!

1600
01:23:56,874 --> 01:23:58,207
That's our answer.

1601
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:00,166
Hill 1-1-8, here we come.

1602
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:03,207
Simmer down, Captain.
This might be a trap.

1603
01:24:03,374 --> 01:24:05,374
But it's our only
chance, Francis.

1604
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,166
If we're lucky, we'll... We'll
slip right through their lines.

1605
01:24:08,249 --> 01:24:10,749
FRANCIS: I'm tellin' ya, Pete.
This could be a trap.

1606
01:25:11,874 --> 01:25:14,707
The Blue Army.
It's there. It's a trap.

1607
01:25:14,999 --> 01:25:16,249
Francis was right.

1608
01:25:16,624 --> 01:25:18,832
Someday you'll believe me.

1609
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:21,582
We'll have to retreat
on the double.

1610
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,874
Get Sergeant Kipp. Yes, Captain.

1611
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:30,499
Did I hear you
say retreat, Captain?

1612
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:32,416
What else can we do?

1613
01:25:32,499 --> 01:25:34,916
Well we can give 'em credit
for havin' some brains.

1614
01:25:34,957 --> 01:25:37,207
They've got our rear
covered and re-covered.

1615
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,791
We go forward.

1616
01:25:38,874 --> 01:25:40,332
Into their waiting arms?

1617
01:25:40,499 --> 01:25:42,749
Into their smoky eyes, yeah.

1618
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:45,916
Right.

1619
01:25:45,999 --> 01:25:48,166
A smoke screen.
FRANCIS: You betcha.

1620
01:25:48,832 --> 01:25:51,041
Now come over here
and pick my pocket.

1621
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:54,041
All right, come on
over, Captain.

1622
01:25:54,124 --> 01:25:56,041
We got the "O" smoke.

1623
01:25:57,707 --> 01:25:58,832
Yes, sir.

1624
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,041
Yes, sir. Over.

1625
01:26:01,832 --> 01:26:03,207
Forward, men.

1626
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:17,832
Ready grenades.

1627
01:26:21,457 --> 01:26:22,457
Fire!

1628
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:55,791
Ugh!

1629
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,767
Ooh! Happy landin', soldier.

1630
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:01,874
(CHUCKLES)

1631
01:27:07,749 --> 01:27:08,749
(GROANS)

1632
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:10,916
Ooh. There's a real
belly-flopper.

1633
01:27:38,874 --> 01:27:42,124
I'll scout a bit, sir, for
a way across the gully.

1634
01:27:51,124 --> 01:27:53,916
FRANCIS: Well, don't stand there, men.
Jump, jump!

1635
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:55,707
Yes, General. Yes, sir!

1636
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:57,874
KAYE: What... What is this?

1637
01:27:58,457 --> 01:28:01,082
Who said that? Who's
giving orders around here?

1638
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,707
I am, sir. What's wrong?

1639
01:28:02,749 --> 01:28:04,749
What's wrong?
Have you gone crazy?

1640
01:28:04,916 --> 01:28:07,707
Don't stand there. Jump. Jump.

1641
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:09,624
Yes, sir!

1642
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:12,683
FRANCIS: Captain! With your men.

1643
01:28:12,707 --> 01:28:14,666
What are you waiting for? Jump!

1644
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:15,987
(STAMMERS) But... But General...

1645
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:18,041
Come back here, Captain!

1646
01:28:18,124 --> 01:28:20,957
I could you men
court-martialed for this!

1647
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:23,791
FRANCIS: Don't stand there!
Jump, General!

1648
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:27,707
Where's that coming from?

1649
01:28:27,791 --> 01:28:29,642
Just a little overdue
payment, General,

1650
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:31,207
on that Burma bridge account.

1651
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:34,041
See you at Point Baker
when the ladies win!

1652
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:35,666
Yes, sir!

1653
01:28:39,707 --> 01:28:41,642
After them. Get that mule.

1654
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:44,666
Shoot that lieutenant!
I mean, disqualify him.

1655
01:28:47,124 --> 01:28:48,600
If you don't mind some
rough goin', General,

1656
01:28:48,624 --> 01:28:49,725
there's a crossing
downhill a ways

1657
01:28:49,749 --> 01:28:51,058
that'll bring us out
near Point Baker.

1658
01:28:51,082 --> 01:28:52,707
Get in that jeep, soldier.

1659
01:29:02,624 --> 01:29:05,666
Oh, General, maybe you'll
need some aspirin now!

1660
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:11,207
Three minutes, General.

1661
01:29:12,082 --> 01:29:13,600
Any luck, General?

1662
01:29:13,624 --> 01:29:15,624
(HOARSE VOICE) Well, they
haven't reached here yet,

1663
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:17,166
have they?

1664
01:29:22,499 --> 01:29:24,957
Well, Major, (CLEARS
THROAT) have they?

1665
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:26,749
No, sir, not yet.

1666
01:29:26,832 --> 01:29:29,600
I think I can guarantee
now that they won't.

1667
01:29:29,624 --> 01:29:31,291
We've plotted their
line of advance

1668
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:33,749
and got them sewed up
tight as a drum.

1669
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:36,600
About three minutes, your little
dream will be over, Louise.

1670
01:29:36,624 --> 01:29:39,624
Aren't you cheering yourself
hoarse a bit too soon, Ben?

1671
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,332
Uh, Louise.

1672
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:44,749
You may as well know this.

1673
01:29:44,832 --> 01:29:47,041
Your girls are on their own now.

1674
01:29:47,124 --> 01:29:48,624
That, uh, little male WAC

1675
01:29:48,707 --> 01:29:50,666
has been disqualified by now.

1676
01:29:50,707 --> 01:29:52,416
There are still
two minutes left.

1677
01:29:52,499 --> 01:29:54,582
Do you mind if I hope
that much longer?

1678
01:29:58,582 --> 01:30:00,041
Two minutes.

1679
01:30:07,874 --> 01:30:09,207
At ease.

1680
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:11,291
What about that Lieutenant?
Did you disqualify him?

1681
01:30:11,332 --> 01:30:13,558
Uh, no, sir. We finally caught
up with this jackass, sir,

1682
01:30:13,582 --> 01:30:16,558
but there was no sign of a lieutenant
or anyone else from the White Army.

1683
01:30:16,582 --> 01:30:17,707
Of course not.

1684
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:20,207
There isn't one of 'em
within miles of us.

1685
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:21,707
You want to bet?

1686
01:30:23,582 --> 01:30:25,166
Who said that?

1687
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:27,749
Mmm-hmm.

1688
01:30:31,207 --> 01:30:32,332
You men carry on.

1689
01:30:34,374 --> 01:30:36,041
Leave that donkey.

1690
01:30:52,124 --> 01:30:54,124
It's a trick.
It's gotta be a trick.

1691
01:30:54,207 --> 01:30:56,749
Why? What trick is
there to talking?

1692
01:30:56,832 --> 01:30:58,517
Any fool can do it.

1693
01:30:58,541 --> 01:30:59,582
(GROANS) Oh.

1694
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:01,707
Unless he loses his voice.

1695

(GROANS)

1696
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,832
And that ain't all you
lost, General Kaye.

1697
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,332
Look!

1698
01:31:15,624 --> 01:31:17,499
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

(CHEERING)

1700
01:31:33,749 --> 01:31:35,874
Not a WAC for miles, huh?

1701
01:31:36,332 --> 01:31:37,499
(LAUGHS)

1702
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:41,416
Open wide, General.
Wider. It won't hurt.

1703
01:31:41,499 --> 01:31:43,957
What do you think
that is, a barn door?

1704
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:47,475
General! We'd certainly like
a few words from you, General,

1705
01:31:47,499 --> 01:31:49,457
straight from the horse's
mouth, you might say.

1706
01:31:49,499 --> 01:31:51,475
(HOARSE VOICE) And that's the
way you're gonna get it, my boy.

1707
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:53,457
If I can talk through
this throat of mine.

1708
01:31:53,499 --> 01:31:56,124
Right over there, sir.
We're all ready for you.

1709
01:32:01,457 --> 01:32:02,874
Okay, Fred?

1710
01:32:05,457 --> 01:32:08,582
Now it is my pleasure and privilege
to introduce to the TV audience

1711
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:10,433
the man who came
from the Pentagon

1712
01:32:10,457 --> 01:32:12,582
to arrange this
camouflage operation.

1713
01:32:12,999 --> 01:32:16,291
Ladies and gentlemen, here
he is, General Ben Kaye!

01:32:17,457 --> 01:32:19,249
FRANCIS: I'll have to be brief,

1716
01:32:19,332 --> 01:32:21,249
because of a touch
of laryngitis.

1717
01:32:21,332 --> 01:32:24,291
But having observed
the camouflage demonstration

1718
01:32:24,374 --> 01:32:27,541
by this splendid group
of Fort Chase WA Cs,

1719
01:32:28,332 --> 01:32:31,433
I must pay tribute to
them and admit defeat.

1720
01:32:31,457 --> 01:32:33,332
(WOMEN CHEERING)

1721
01:32:38,999 --> 01:32:41,374
A magnificent job, ladies.

1722
01:32:41,749 --> 01:32:43,041
Magnificent!

1723
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:45,416
But with Major
Simpson's leadership,

1724
01:32:45,499 --> 01:32:47,416
how could it be otherwise?

1725
01:32:47,457 --> 01:32:49,041
(WOMEN CHEERING)

1726
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:51,166
I just can't believe it.

1727
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:53,392
A salute to Company C.

1728
01:32:53,416 --> 01:32:56,541
The Army is proud of you. Proud!

1729
01:32:56,624 --> 01:32:58,166
(APPLAUSE)

1730
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,457
You all right, General?

1731
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:12,666
Of course I'm all right.

1732
01:33:12,749 --> 01:33:14,249
I want you to arrest that mule.

1733
01:33:14,332 --> 01:33:16,017
Have that mule court-martialed...
Mule, sir?

1734
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:17,392
That mule! Get that mule!
At once, sir.

1735
01:33:17,416 --> 01:33:18,892
Right now! Get that mule.
At once, sir.

1736
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:21,374
(CLOCK CHIMING) (HUMMING)

1737
01:33:26,957 --> 01:33:28,374
(SIGHS)

1738
01:33:29,374 --> 01:33:30,666
Oh.

1739
01:33:31,374 --> 01:33:34,207
Boy, I never had
a general before!

1740
01:33:39,374 --> 01:33:41,350
This is really the end.

1741
01:33:41,374 --> 01:33:43,457
Let's get outta here,
Lieutenant!
