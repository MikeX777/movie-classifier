1
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,316
GREAT INVENTIONS

2
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,275
So... this...

3
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,494
She is the muse,
the muse of great inventions.

4
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,095
I put it at the beginning of the book

5
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,914
Because women are at the origin
of all great inventions.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,551
It doesn't sound very smart because
muses never invent anything.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,112
They suggest, then
they use and then they smash everything.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,272
On the other hand, every invention
Is a crime against nature.

9
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:04,831
And when it comes to invention,
you always have to look for...

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,150
looking for a woman!

11
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:10,328
Galileo, for example, when he
invented himself that the earth was round,

12
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:12,870
He did so because he had been observing
the stars for a long time.

13
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,994
And from a certain age on,
When looking at the stars,

14
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,911
there is always a sentimental reason.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,695
And Newton's apple,
from which tree do you think it fell,

16
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,235
If not from the tree
Of the garden of Eden?

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,757
Newton's apple
and Eve's apple are

18
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,441
The same apple, the same crime,

19
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,874
And thus the same sin.

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,261
Well, Professor Norman's N734,
my boss,

21
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:38,993
is the same thing,
originally there was a woman.

22
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:44,993
True, you don't know what N734 is,
but I will introduce it to you.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,353
Professor Norman, my boss,
has been tinkering with test tubes for three years.

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,173
Things were not going well.

25
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,878
He had the lousy mood of an inventor
who hasn't invented anything in a long time.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,100
And then there were ants.
Gross ants.

27
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:33,630
POCKET LOVE

28
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,275
Maubru...

29
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:58,976
Maubru.

30
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,001
Yes?

31
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:02,246
Experiment 3267.

32
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,679
Solution 503.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,674
Ant, family 804, land.

34
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,981
Result?

35
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:19,076
Null.

36
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:41,789
Maubru.

37
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,815
Yes?

38
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,079
Open the door.

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,111
Here! Good! Let's go, let's go!

40
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,749
This way, this way, straight to you.

41
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,193
Now lay it down. Very good!
Ah, you have ruined my pedal!

42
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,593
But, but.
what does it mean, dear colleague?

43
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,135
As simple as drinking
a glass of water.

44
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,993
Here is the amount
of energy expended,

45
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,228
There the amount of carbon dioxide
released. Here the oxygen.

46
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,200
No, no, no, no...
I mean, what does it mean

47
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:20,959
the intrusion of his
material into my laboratory?

48
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,368
Is he getting married soon?

49
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:23,475
I don't see the connection.

50
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,994
Honeymoon!

51
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:27,661
I am not going to leave all
this valuable space unused.

52
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,112
So I store.

53
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,678
I do not intend to make any
trip, and even if I do,

54
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,194
I wouldn't let you have my
workshop as a warehouse.

55
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,254
Mobru, the counter!

56
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,430
No, Mr. Professor.
It's class time.

57
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh the lesson!

58
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:41,717
Clear it all out!

59
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,953
As early as 1907,
Dr. André Nepveu,

60
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,509
known by the pseudonym
Luc Durtain's literary name,

61
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,560
proved that it is possible to
to freeze at minus 12 degrees...

62
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,841
eyes of fish, rabbit and bird.

63
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:58,813
Hey, Jerome is looking good.

64
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,573
A toad petrified by the cold,

65
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,255
to such an extent that it is difficult to
to break it with a hammer,

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,135
resumes life as soon as it is
brought to normal temperature.

67
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,446
- 500 francs not wearing glasses.
- What?

68
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,526
- For your notes.
- 500 is not enough.

69
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,639
And my belt.

70
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:15,884
Gone!

71
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,326
No! No!

72
00:06:19,351 --> 00:06:20,359
In 1950.

73
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:21,979
I won, give me the belt!

74
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,472
- Home.
- No, now!

75
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,535
His body was hard
like metal...

76
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,154
It is his girlfriend who
makes him wear glasses.

77
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,549
They don't need them.

78
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,781
Have you ever seen his girlfriend?

79
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:34,695
Don't distract me.

80
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,951
...because the temperature
continues to rise.

81
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,995
Is he your boyfriend?

82
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,992
It's not bad, huh?

83
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:46,340
Is he really a scientist?

84
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,495
Father guaranteed it to me.

85
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,455
His favorite student,
he practically raised him.

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,273
Raised well.

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,581
Father says if we take care of it
care of it, it can win the Pavlov Prize.

88
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:59,876
And the Pavlov is the first
step toward the Nobel Prize.

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,879
Handsome, intelligent, affectionate...
and obedient.

90
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,095
The opposite of your ex-husband.
Hey, did you know that he remarried?

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Really?

92
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:15,281
Yes, with a hideous redhead.
A movie guy.

93
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,995
From the movies?
Good for him.

94
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,513
Instead you have to be on guard.
With those eyes there...

95
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,034
Don't worry.

96
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,721
Men should
work only with men

97
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,735
and should not
ever travel alone.

98
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,391
That's why I was compelled
to go to this event.

99
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,946
Are you going to stay here then?

100
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,455
Yes. Mom and dad
are staying upstairs.

101
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,695
Thanks to the internal ladder, I can
go up and down without having to go outside.

102
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,030
I can have dinner with
Mother if I want to.

103
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,255
For now Jerome is not staying here,
so I will furnish as I please.

104
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,079
Why? Don't you like it?

105
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,676
I like it!
But why are you staying in this hole?

106
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
Your place in Paris

107
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,115
Do you think I enjoy
being in the province?

108
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:04,815
I'm just waiting for
for the right opportunity.

109
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,756
Jerome is so busy in the lab
and I don't want to rush him.

110
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,781
Again?

111
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:14,517
An American pastor, Basile
Luyet of Saint Louis University,

112
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,826
defined a state of
thermodynamically stable configuration...

113
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:20,755
- How is it going with Monette?
- He may be doing better.

114
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,440
His mother painted in
white a step on the stairs.

115
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:25,133
Prohibition of entry. Understand?

116
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,460
Do you think you are in the Middle Ages?

117
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:28,078
...heating degree.

118
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:29,724
Monette.

119
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:31,331
Hey, Jean-Loup is calling you.

120
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:32,409
Can't you see that I'm busy?

121
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,998
Slower!

122
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:38,255
Apart from the scientific prizes,
what's in it for him?

123
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,687
Glory!

124
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,954
Is that all?

125
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,670
Daughter of a professor and granddaughter
Of a scientist, you will be wife...

126
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,117
And you are the daughter of a
soda vendor and you will be...

127
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,157
Shut up, you idiot!

128
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,468
I was thinking.

129
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:52,516
Pull.

130
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,755
Your Jerome...
Are you sure he will win the prize....

131
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,400
Pavlov?

132
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,694
Why not?
With the connections my father has....

133
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,719
Good.

134
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:03,815
Our brand needs
needs some visibility

135
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,454
"Juvacola. Are you tired?
Juvacola and the tiredness goes away!"

136
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,595
It works great!
Too much so.

137
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:14,988
The most envious competitors have
started a campaign against Juvacola.

138
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:19,463
They imply that it excites young people,
that it keeps them from sleeping.

139
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:20,504
But it is true!

140
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,706
It is true,
but there is no need to emphasize it.

141
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:28,120
If an unchallenged scientist
directed a research center

142
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:31,581
dedicated to improving the human race
human through carbonated beverages,

143
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:32,605
as the Juvacola,

144
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,558
one would silence
silence the envious.

145
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,141
And when Jérôme
wins his prize,

146
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,695
Will it be like winning
your Juvacola as well?

147
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Yeah!

148
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,154
Yes, but wait a minute!

149
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,674
If I give you my scientist,
what do you give me in return?

150
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,395
I need to talk to Raymond and he
with the board of directors.

151
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,312
But if they agree,
a solution can be found.

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,981
How much does your Jerome earn?

153
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,000
So it earns...
Actually, I don't know.

154
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,515
Well, he will earn 10 times more.

155
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:13,675
10 times more?

156
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:16,193
Get everything ready for tomorrow.

157
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,630
Professor.

158
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:19,761
Have you frozen
something in the lab?

159
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,141
What about the cold-blooded animals?
The turtles?

160
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,510
- Have you read Goldsmith's article?
- Not yet.

161
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,279
He is insane.
He needs to be watched.

162
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:31,832
Sir, are you looking for an assistant? I am
qualified! Sir, please say yes.

163
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,230
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

164
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:36,988
- Am I coming tomorrow?
- Tomorrow in my workshop.

165
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,728
- 6:00 p.m.?
- Yes.

166
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:40,200
Oh, thank you, thank you!

167
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,867
Girl, look at me!
I am a genius!

168
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:48,505
You are talking to the assistant to
Professor Norman. I start tomorrow.

169
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,871
Hypocrite!
You said you didn't care!

170
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,606
Don't you understand that it is a damnation?

171
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,355
What if gangsters used it to make a
disappear an atomic scientist...?

172
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,975
- Are you coming?
- No, I have to work.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,315
- I will help you.
- Like the other day, with your hands?

174
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:02,608
Who are those beautiful women?

175
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,074
I don't know, they don't look like mothers.

176
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,095
Maybe they are teachers' wives.

177
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,919
You are formidable! I recognized
one! That's Norman's girlfriend!

178
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,088
Good.
I want to go play tennis.

179
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,375
It is boring.

180
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,319
- I want to make my friends toil.
- I will not get tired!

181
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,095
Jerome.
My fiancé...

182
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,840
This is my friend Anne-Lise,
I told you about her.

183
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:27,095
She and her husband have a
booth at the exposition. Wonderful!

184
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,728
I hope you will give us the pleasure
of coming to the opening.

185
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:30,915
Excuse me, sir...

186
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,695
I was unable to
find in the laboratory

187
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,928
the book on particles
colloids in the protoplasm.

188
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:38,308
He talked about it in the course.
The author seems to me to be Mechnikov?

189
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,628
No, no, not at all.
His name is Colignon.

190
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:42,319
One of my students...

191
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,794
Jean-Loup Prade.

192
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:44,895
Good morning.

193
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,797
Shall we go?

194
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,408
Who is that beautiful girl?

195
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:53,401
I don't know ... probably
one of my students...

196
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:54,425
Ah...

197
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,910
Good. F 23 AX, B series.

198
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Good morning.

199
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,998
Now F 23 AZ.

200
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,280
But no, you imbecile!
You gave me the Series A.

201
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:09,326
- Oh...excuse me, miss!
- No problem, sir.

202
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:10,679
Can I help you?

203
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,264
I am the one who should help her.

204
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,366
I'm afraid I don't understand.

205
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:15,666
I am his assistant.

206
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,975
What did Bataillon do?

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,668
- What does he think he is doing?
- I don't know.

208
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,535
I already have an assistant.

209
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,620
- No.
- Yes! Now he's going to see it. Maubru!

210
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:24,819
He will not come.

211
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,688
And why shouldn't he come?

212
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:29,680
I let it go.
I will replace it.

213
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:31,889
Impossible. In what?

214
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:32,914
In all.

215
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:33,939
Maubru.

216
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,745
- Finally!
- Again?

217
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,916
- But I have to go in!
- Not now!

218
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,948
I don't know you, miss.

219
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:42,381
But, sir, he had told me.

220
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,687
I don't know your level of
knowledge in biology,

221
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,047
And all I can say to her
Is that I don't need her.

222
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:50,788
Very good. I don't have much to
tell you, except that you are a liar.

223
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:51,813
Why liar?

224
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,126
Because yesterday he told me to come!

225
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,812
Me? But when did I ever?

226
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:58,917
At this point, I don't want to
even work with her anymore....

227
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,790
- Well, are you finished?
- No, no, no, no!

228
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,893
- Does it close the door again?
- Yes!

229
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,872
If I get rid of him, will he keep me?

230
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,168
Look, Miss.

231
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,793
What does he have to risk?

232
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,100
All right, try it.

233
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,806
- What do you wish for, professor?
- I, here...

234
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,920
So, boss?

235
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,558
For me, that's fine.

236
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,033
Give me the second copy to sign.

237
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:38,381
So do we agree?

238
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:41,975
Jerome will work for 2-3 months
in one of our workshops here,

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,974
Then we will find a pretext
to move him to Paris.

240
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,725
I recommend that before
the beginning of the school year.

241
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,446
It will be all right.

242
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,855
Louisette, call the
advertising office in Paris

243
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,201
And have it announced to the press....

244
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,590
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Wait till I warn Jerome first.

245
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,798
Haven't you talked to him about it yet?
What if he refuses?

246
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,495
He will not refuse.

247
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,518
Louisette,
call Paris...

248
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,031
- The day after tomorrow.
- The day after tomorrow.

249
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:11,775
You didn't even
mention the conditions?

250
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,271
Jerome does not understand the
numbers under a million.

251
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,460
2 quadrillion 4 trillion
673 million 274 632.

252
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,015
Can I go?

253
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,553
Yes. Have a good evening.

254
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,274
Hey, stop it!
How restless you are . . .

255
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,861
- Shall we go skating?
- I'm not done yet!

256
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:48,367
- At this time?
- The experiment is still in progress.

257
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,114
- A very diligent young lady!
- So what?

258
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,958
So should I leave?
- Yes.

259
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,710
Here,
take Atom and come back in an hour.

260
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,385
Pass me the data,
they should be ready.

261
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,801
Was he your boyfriend?

262
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,559
No, boss.
Just a classmate.

263
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,714
Thank you. He is not even a friend.
He is nobody in short.

264
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,375
If you want, go with him,
I can finish by myself.

265
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,693
No, boss.
I'm passionate about this work.

266
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,460
Yes, I'm sure I will be passionate about it....
But I would like to understand...

267
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,619
What?

268
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:30,055
If you don't mind explaining, it's the
ant thing that I don't understand.

269
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,146
With larger animals,
yes, but with ants....

270
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,678
All right-do you remember my
course on freezing?

271
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:40,959
You will remember that toads and fish became
frozen and hardened like stones,

272
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,909
But once they warmed up they
resumed life as if nothing had happened.

273
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,836
Ants freeze at zero
absolute kelvin, or -273 degrees,

274
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,726
have revived normally.

275
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:54,041
Has a person ever been
frozen in a laboratory?

276
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:55,573
No, no, do you volunteer?

277
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,711
All scientists
dream of freezing life.

278
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,076
My idea is to
replace the cold

279
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:05,358
with a product that has a similar effect
similar on living cells.

280
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,135
Instead of freezing them, I coagulate them.

281
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,074
So I slow down life at will.

282
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:16,653
Here is a drop
containing live protozoa.

283
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,832
Here's another one,
where they are all dead.

284
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,606
And here finally, the one where life
Is suspended, thanks to my product.

285
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,128
My N734

286
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:40,420
Should act in the same way
on ant cells.

287
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,306
I'll take an ant...

288
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:54,361
But where is it?

289
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,671
That is exactly what I would like to know.

290
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,400
Do you see anything there?

291
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,710
Have you seen it?

292
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,397
Excuse me... That was not my intention.

293
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,001
So? Do they keep
disappear these ants?

294
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,038
Yeah.

295
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,021
Do you suffer so much that you don't eat?

296
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:25,553
Put yourself in my place.
It's my job.

297
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,255
Look... you are free to
to do whatever you want, but ...

298
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,158
If I were you, I would leave it alone.

299
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,951
Something tells me you are on the
wrong path. Female intuition.

300
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,273
Let's go.
Put on the dress quickly.

301
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,298
Is it that way?

302
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,279
Yes, in your room.
There, in the cardboard boxes.

303
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,825
You know what...?

304
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,030
What?

305
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,113
The Bonjeans have
offered coffee service.

306
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,175
Baroness Edmond has an ice bucket
for ice made of jewels.

307
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,720
Just think, there will be 400 covers!

308
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:03,636
The cultural attaché will come on purpose
from Paris. Are you listening to me?

309
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,116
Did you find it?
Did you hurt yourself?

310
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,600
Hurry up, mother's guests
will arrive in 15 minutes.

311
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,420
Here it is!

312
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,195
How does Anne-Lise look to you?

313
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,221
I like.

314
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:31,194
I am glad because
he gave us the most beautiful gift.

315
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,427
Huh? What gift?

316
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:35,146
Location.

317
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:36,172
I already have it.

318
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:38,286
No. You have a job.

319
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,476
What difference does it make?

320
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:41,449
A working man's wife

321
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,077
wears a fur coat of
rabbit instead of mink.

322
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:45,535
Take Mom for example...

323
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,817
his dinner costs the same as
three days of vacation.

324
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:50,951
Since she has been married, she has been using the furniture
she received from her mother-in-law.

325
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,231
Don't worry!

326
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:55,353
You'll get the mink when I find
The secret to slowing down life.

327
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:58,194
No. I also like it from rabbit.

328
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,069
Well, if I don't find the slowdown
Of life, I have my super vitamin.

329
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,633
A rabbit takes
3 kilograms in two days.

330
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:09,386
Nobody wants to get fat!
People want just the opposite.

331
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:14,429
Listen,
Anne-Lise is giving us an unhoped-for opportunity.

332
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,908
Give dad your resignation
And in a month's time,

333
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,350
You go into private industry, okay?

334
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,161
The dogs, the carp!
The rabbits, the doves, the mice!

335
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:39,906
Is this a description of Noah's Ark?

336
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,554
It is not acquiring the results.

337
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,608
Turn everything off.

338
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:47,408
But how,
six weeks of observations...

339
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:48,633
Turn everything off.

340
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,920
Do we start from scratch?

341
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:01,077
No, we're stopping!

342
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,628
So do we release them all?

343
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,588
Momo, Bertrand, Jules,
Zoe, Gustave, Caroline, Alfred...

344
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,721
Are they the calendar saints?

345
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:12,375
I have given names to all of them...
except for these who were born yesterday.

346
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,392
I'm leaving!
I'm leaving the laboratory!

347
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,114
I will have a new, much better one.
Unlimited credit.

348
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:22,556
But it is wonderful!
Nothing to be sad about!

349
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,191
Unlimited credit, but no Momo,
no Arthur or Caroline.

350
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,061
All research

351
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:34,495
Will revolve around the improvement
of humanity through gazoses and tonics.

352
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,528
Like the Juvacola?

353
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:36,796
Exactly.

354
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,775
"Juvacola-super.

355
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,191
And that's why you leave your job?

356
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,156
With the results obtained...

357
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,566
734 changes to my formula and
only so many disappearing ants!

358
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,915
Professor, can I go?
My train is in 27 minutes.

359
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,940
Where are you going?

360
00:21:55,965 --> 00:22:00,526
Professor, do you remember that I have a leave of absence
of 15 days? I'm going to my grandmother's.

361
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:01,555
Go.

362
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,238
Thank you, professor.

363
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,948
Is there no chance...?

364
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,935
None.
It would take a miracle.

365
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,071
All right, I'll take it all out.

366
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,639
Don't worry, Atom.

367
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,520
Did he want a miracle?

368
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:42,153
It worked.

369
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,955
Yes! It worked! It worked!

370
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,835
The ants were
too small to see.

371
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,980
She never wears her
glasses when she needs them.

372
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:51,313
Calm down, we understand the method.

373
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:54,756
Maybe there is no method.
She is always observing

374
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,335
It is necessary to observe,
to gain experience.

375
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,879
I don't talk about the experiences.

376
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:01,421
It is not always important
that the calculations are right.

377
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,113
Chance also plays a role.

378
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,035
What if Newton had not
dropped the apple on his nose?

379
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,430
His apple is my little Atom.

380
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,615
My little Atom...

381
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:17,839
No, no, no ... you are my apple ...

382
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,791
Hmm... Good. Let's go in order!

383
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,110
Or maybe it's better to
make some messes.

384
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,913
Another ant and
another vial of N734.

385
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,195
Here.

386
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,040
Ants, ants,
ants, the whole anthill!

387
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:10,110
Ah,
my experience is worthless.

388
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,754
Female intuition...

389
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,195
Always late!

390
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,681
We don't go to your father.

391
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:31,821
Why?

392
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,946
Ah! Why did you decide
to sell knick-knacks?

393
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:38,481
Much better!

394
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:39,506
Meaning?

395
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:43,381
But how?
My N734 solution works.

396
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:47,677
This was a real rabbit. And this one
Was a real guinea pig.

397
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,961
The indefinite conservation
Of matter. Here it is.

398
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:53,679
The ants have not disappeared.

399
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,719
They turned to stone,
decreasing in size!

400
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,868
Are you saying that
these are real animals?

401
00:24:58,892 --> 00:24:59,921
But yes!

402
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:01,080
But it's disgusting!

403
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,513
This cannot
be serious!

404
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,071
Because of these ridiculous little things,
you wanted to change our plans?

405
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,594
For what purpose then?

406
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,228
You have invented a new way
To kill poor animals.

407
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:17,952
This is nothing to brag about.

408
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,068
And of course, you don't know how to revive them?
Don't you?

409
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:23,093
But.

410
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:25,838
Okay, let's go.
Father is waiting for us.

411
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,654
I told him you had resigned.
He felt sorry for you,

412
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,846
But of course, the happiness of
his daughter comes first.

413
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:46,959
Aren't you thirsty? Go ahead, drink up.

414
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,870
That's it!
Did you see how easy it was?

415
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:55,839
One always thinks one is
to be indispensable

416
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:57,807
And instead they are happy
when one leaves.

417
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:00,957
Especially that colleague of yours
who can take over your laboratory.

418
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:04,105
Perhaps your method can
be used in the industry of

419
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,717
chimney linings.
Obviously it will be very expensive, but ...

420
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,820
Perhaps I can revive them.
The research takes time.

421
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:16,149
How long did it take before
your beasts became petrified?

422
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,640
3 years.

423
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,875
You have 15 days to
try to revive them.

424
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,317
Next, preparations for the
wedding. Then, 15 days in Paris.

425
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,921
You are going to Juvacola on August 1.
In the meantime, you can have fun here.

426
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:36,401
Chief, look!

427
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:37,792
Yeah ... you have fun ...

428
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,635
I don't think I know her.
Who is this lovely young lady?

429
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,068
Monette...

430
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:45,871
Monette Landry,
assistant professor Norman.

431
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,981
Sorry for the interruption.

432
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,177
No, no, not at all!
No interruption.

433
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:51,966
I came for Monette. If the
Mr. Norman is finished with her...

434
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,063
No, we are not finished!

435
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,935
I thought you didn't know her.
She is pretty...

436
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,079
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Very nice. Even too much so.

437
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,215
Your colleagues are envious
And they will start gossiping.

438
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,436
Father will suffer so much....

439
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:10,753
I am not jealous, I want the
best for your career... Hey!

440
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,909
Mr. Prade,
the young lady needs to be with

441
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,621
my fiancé,
would you mind accompanying me?

442
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:17,869
With pleasure.

443
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,554
Let's leave the scientists
to their own work.

444
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,968
Can I take the dog with me?

445
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:24,993
No.

446
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:26,906
The dog.

447
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,769
It is moving.

448
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:32,794
Do you think so?

449
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,719
It seems to me. Shall we open?

450
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,993
No. Two more minutes.

451
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,868
What are you doing?

452
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:48,038
I promise St. Lazarus to
Return the collar I stole.

453
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,155
Why St. Lazarus?

454
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:51,966
He is the patron saint of the resurrected.

455
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,030
Nothing.
Maybe you stole two collars.

456
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,113
Damn!

457
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:49,155
This was my last hope.

458
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,997
And our last day.

459
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,135
Don't cry. I will find you
A much better leader than I am.

460
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,276
There is no one better than you.

461
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,622
I have been waiting for it for 15 days....

462
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:13,742
15 days?

463
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:14,796
Yes.

464
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,178
Ever since I realized that
you don't love your girlfriend.

465
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:21,300
You keep crying though...

466
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,498
Of joy.

467
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,955
But what...?

468
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,110
What?

469
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,440
Quick, quick, come here.

470
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:38,588
No no!
We need to figure out what's going on!

471
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:40,235
I am afraid!

472
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:43,791
The tears! The tears! Water
Salted in the proportion of 0.033!

473
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,991
Come on, cry now!

474
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:48,034
Cry!

475
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,197
I can't!

476
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,556
Yes, of course. Always the same story!

477
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,274
When it is not necessary,
you cry, and when it is needed.

478
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,698
You are a monster!

479
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,326
For you, tears are
only 0.033 saline solution!

480
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,895
My tears are pain!
I am in pain!

481
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:07,793
Brava! Brava.
Brava. Cry! Cry! Cry!

482
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,326
Come on.

483
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,075
Come on!

484
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,746
Again!

485
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,358
It does not work.

486
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,239
Maybe it only works with ants?

487
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,359
I don't think so.

488
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,671
Probably, you have to immerse it
completely in the solution.

489
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,312
Do you want me to cry so much?

490
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,190
Here it is. It's 198 grams.

491
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,601
Damn!

492
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,909
It is not enough that it is covered.

493
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,792
The volume of salt water

494
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,238
Must be greater than the size
of the living animal's body.

495
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,290
Oh no! No, no!

496
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:56,975
Phone.

497
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,428
Let it ring.

498
00:31:58,452 --> 00:31:59,468
Answer.

499
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:00,768
No. Let me...

500
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,199
Go!

501
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,550
Hello?

502
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,518
What? Ah, is that you?

503
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,076
No, no, honey.

504
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,694
What do you mean, "honey?"

505
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,753
No, no, I worked.

506
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,278
If I experiment, it is
because I trust in success.

507
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,313
No, I would rather not kill
beasts and have dinner with you.

508
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,835
Eh, it's quite dangerous.
It could all blow up.

509
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,335
Do you know what you should do?

510
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,615
Eat some chocolates and
go to bed without waiting for me

511
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,429
And later, when I get home,
I will say good night to you

512
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,319
What do you mean if I'm alone here?
Of course, I am alone.

513
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,078
At this time then.
All right, see you soon.

514
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,808
What is it?

515
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:03,275
My fiancée.

516
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:04,559
No, it is not.

517
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,395
She is my fiancée, my
fiancée reduced to an equation.

518
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,757
It's simple.
Do you know the arithmetic of passion?

519
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:14,833
What about that philosopher? Jeremy Bentham?

520
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,389
What were you doing in the classroom?

521
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,048
I used to draw the professor.

522
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:22,110
Ah, good. Great!

523
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,188
So, the philosopher Jeremy...

524
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,437
Bentham.
He invented the arithmetic of the passions.

525
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,126
For example, if you are offered
a trip to Italy

526
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:33,634
And you don't know what to do,
make two columns.

527
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,714
In the one on the right,

528
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,635
take notes on what you
like and left the opposite.

529
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,031
Therefore, the grades will be
proportionate to your pleasure.

530
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,135
For example, right...

531
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,272
The things I like.

532
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:51,390
Yes. So.
"Change of scenery - 8.

533
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,674
"Enrichment of
experience and culture" - 8.5.

534
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:00,552
"Traveling in sleeping car together" - 10.

535
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,595
10...

536
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,780
"Buying new clothes" - 9.

537
00:34:04,805 --> 00:34:05,855
9...

538
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,780
"Seeing Capri" - 7.
"Buying new hats..."

539
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:11,600
- 7... Wait a minute!
- 8.5. - 8.5...

540
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,548
"Visiting museums" - 8.

541
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:16,033
Oh. 2.

542
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,077
2. Well, that's enough.

543
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,073
Now in the second column
mark what you don't like.

544
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,039
Nothing. With you I like everything.

545
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,486
- Do you want to learn or not?
- Yes.

546
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:30,157
Do the additions and
decide whether to make the trip

547
00:34:30,182 --> 00:34:32,526
based on the column
that has the highest total.

548
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,216
Same thing with my girlfriend.

549
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:38,034
I write on the right what makes her
angry, on the left what calms her down.

550
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,191
Two additions, one subtraction.

551
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,815
And depending on the outcome,
I am calm, firm or lovely.

552
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,021
And are you often forced
to be lovely?

553
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:50,893
Oh, it's not that terrible at all,
thanks to my kindness...

554
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:51,920
Your kindness is exaggerated.

555
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:55,718
Edith is waiting for me to
drop by to say good night to her.

556
00:34:57,406 --> 00:34:59,256
- Shut up, Atom!
- Who's there?

557
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,808
Open up! Why have you locked yourself in?

558
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,428
Who is it? Is it you?

559
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:04,455
It is not so terrible...

560
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,636
It's me, Edith!

561
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,068
I know you are not alone! Open!

562
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:13,655
I'm sure that
girl is with you! Open up now!

563
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,315
I can't now!

564
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:17,470
Open up, quickly!

565
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,571
I am just finishing an experiment!

566
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:22,850
An experiment! I can imagine what
kind of experiment you are doing!

567
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,346
Can you hear me? Open or I'll break down the door!

568
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,508
Here, here, here, here I come!

569
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,695
I warn you, I'm going to scream!

570
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,865
You are wasting time.

571
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,393
I will scream so loud that
the whole neighborhood will hear!

572
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,200
Jerome! Open!

573
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,873
I'm going to scream!

574
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,559
If you don't open on 3, I'll scream!

575
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,512
I'm starting to count! One!

576
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,635
Two!

577
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:55,949
I'm coming!

578
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,200
Jerome, open now!

579
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,895
What are you doing?

580
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:11,981
Where is she?

581
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,855
- She who?
- He said, "Shut up, Atom."

582
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Shut up, Atom!

583
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,041
Shut up, Atom!

584
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:18,672
You see for yourself...

585
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,615
I must conclude,
my dear Edith,

586
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,233
that you are not the
ideal for a researcher.

587
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:33,452
I, I am the one who will make you
win the Pavlov Prize!

588
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:36,039
You confuse rewards and results.

589
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,892
Awards mean nothing. What
that matters are their motivations.

590
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:41,518
I will take care of the Pavlov Prize.

591
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:44,046
No, no, from now on
I will take care of everything.

592
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,400
First of all,
tomorrow I will withdraw my resignation

593
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,135
And I will not leave my workshop.

594
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,631
And I will tell Madame Juvacola
That she can croak. That's it!

595
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,755
Do you realize that you are
you are ruining my life?

596
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,091
If I ruin your life, you are free
to take back your word.

597
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,063
And now, good night.
I need to work.

598
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,995
And alone!

599
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,603
So.
Aren't we done yet?

600
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:24,749
No.

601
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,516
And you don't say good night?

602
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,435
Good night.

603
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:35,559
I did not hear.

604
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:40,780
Good night.

605
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,710
Good.

606
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,241
Here! No, to the right!

607
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,381
Bataillon!

608
00:38:57,405 --> 00:39:00,013
Pay attention and follow along!

609
00:39:00,306 --> 00:39:01,973
Aren't you up yet?

610
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:05,015
No, no, the box there and
the plant on the porch.

611
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,241
But what's going on?

612
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:08,761
How what happens.
Items are delivered.

613
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:12,281
When the utensils arrive
from the kitchen, Solange will clean everything.

614
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:13,881
Aren't you going to the workshop?

615
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:15,054
There is not much to do.

616
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,814
- Your breakfast, sir.
- Thank you.

617
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,599
Mom and dad are waiting for me.
If you want, meet me at 1:30?

618
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,311
I have to run.
I have a thousand things to do. Bye!

619
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,629
Hello.

620
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,355
Solange!

621
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Sir?

622
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:45,910
Salt! So much salt!

623
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,375
Table salt?

624
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,961
Yes, table salt
And a kitchen scale.

625
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:52,351
All right, sir.

626
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,350
Someone will now take
will take a bath.

627
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,745
Here, sir.

628
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,080
Well thank you.

629
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,312
Is that all we have?

630
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:20,728
There is enough for a week.

631
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:24,190
You need to have a supply
of salt for at least a month!

632
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,830
What if we run out of it?
Come on, go get me some salt.

633
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,115
Find me the salt! Please!

634
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:31,205
Yes, sir.

635
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,483
Solange, what's going on?

636
00:40:32,508 --> 00:40:37,514
Madam, the gentleman scolded me
about the salt. I run to bring it to him.

637
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Enter.

638
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,075
Here, sir.

639
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,732
Ah, thank you. Thank you, you can go.

640
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:56,818
Solange! There is no water!

641
00:40:56,842 --> 00:40:59,362
The plumbing system is
under repair, monsieur.

642
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,555
Ouch, what a house!

643
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,895
Maubru.
I need a large vessel.

644
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,655
Professor,
do you think I got a tan?

645
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,959
I want a big vessel!

646
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,121
This big?

647
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,951
As large as possible.

648
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,919
The biggest one has it
Mr. Bataillon.

649
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,456
Maubru.

650
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,599
Wish?

651
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,168
I... I was admiring the
his bath in the cistern.

652
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:43,728
It is neither a toilet nor a cistern!

653
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:46,335
This is the "Aquadinamometer
Bataillon model."

654
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,734
Would you like to lend it to me?

655
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:51,631
The experiment he interrupted
will last until 2 a.m.

656
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:55,793
Also, I don't lend my
Bataillon aquadynamometer to anyone

657
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:57,158
Until I have it patented.

658
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,389
And even after the patent,
I will not lend it to you!

659
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,716
Throw everything in the trash.

660
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,789
Too bad. They were beautiful.

661
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,306
25 cubic decimeters with 0.033 solution...

662
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,479
If the tank is larger, I will add
7.85 grams -- plus 10 cubes....

663
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:31,546
LE BISON BATHROOMS

664
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:45,853
It is strictly forbidden to introduce
into the tank products brought from home.

665
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:48,498
If you want bath salts,
he can purchase it at the checkout.

666
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,508
That's fine, I'll take it.

667
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:59,191
Made to order only.
Delivery in three weeks.

668
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,999
Hey! Taxi!

669
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,871
No jokes, huh?

670
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,431
Jerome,
swear that you will love me forever.

671
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,315
How should I know?

672
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,518
In that case,
how do you think I could trust it?

673
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,881
Trust who? Me?

674
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,310
No, about me.

675
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,559
If I'm not sure forever,
then what's the point of loving you today?

676
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,796
Perhaps to be happy.

677
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,510
Do you think it's easy to be happy?
It is very, very difficult.

678
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,281
Also particularly long.
I've been waiting for you for 30 hours.

679
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:00,305
But...!

680
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,918
30 hours! Maybe you are starving?

681
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,501
Why should I?

682
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:09,555
But 30 hours. 30 hours you haven't eaten.
Aren't you hungry?

683
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:10,579
No.

684
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:13,053
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

685
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:14,580
What is it? Do I look bad?

686
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:15,615
No, no.

687
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,826
Breathe. Breathe.

688
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,740
Breathe! Breathe deep!

689
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:21,152
You crush me.

690
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,568
Your hand.

691
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:27,761
Don't you like it?

692
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,994
I like it, I like it.

693
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,954
How do I look?

694
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,908
I don't know.

695
00:46:32,932 --> 00:46:34,395
How does he look?

696
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:35,549
I don't know.

697
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,460
Good.

698
00:46:38,485 --> 00:46:41,028
Are you going to x-ray me
next time?

699
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,792
Next time I will get you
the pressure before and after.

700
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,433
And tomorrow I will start drafting my
my communication to the Academy.

701
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,759
Back from class?

702
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:20,794
Yes,
"study of aquatic mammals."

703
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:22,068
Is this a joke?

704
00:47:22,093 --> 00:47:23,194
No, I wouldn't dare.

705
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:27,120
I have responsibilities!
Therefore, I need to know...

706
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,198
...everything, miss?

707
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,793
18.30 - I leave the faculty,
8 p.m. - I have dinner with a childhood friend,

708
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:33,675
10 p.m. - Let's go to the movies.
Midnight, at her place.

709
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,581
At her house? Is she a girl?

710
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:39,221
And finally, today at noon
we were at the beach.

711
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:40,674
Monette. Where have you been?

712
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:42,414
Mr. Prade,
forget the white step!

713
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:43,500
I have to change.

714
00:47:43,524 --> 00:47:44,895
Wait...!

715
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,479
Mr. Prade, the white step!

716
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:47,705
Excuse me, miss.

717
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,358
- Where are you coming from?
- Can't you see it?

718
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:50,731
- And before that?
- I had breakfast.

719
00:47:50,755 --> 00:47:53,784
- Where? Were you alone?
- At the Grand Dukes'. I was not alone.

720
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:58,203
Ah, you were with him. The Don Juan
of the Amphitheater, the future Nobel laureate.

721
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:00,136
How about you? How is the beautiful Edith?

722
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:02,062
Who were you with at the end?

723
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:03,176
- With my uncle.
- What?

724
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,895
Yes, with my uncle.
Now leave me alone.

725
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,255
If you think I'm running after you ...

726
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,733
I don't think it, I see it.

727
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,555
To the two of us, I heard it all!

728
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,008
Perfect, are you spying on me now?

729
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:22,393
Not out here, come in.

730
00:48:22,418 --> 00:48:25,831
You have no childhood friends or an uncle.
Confession.

731
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,399
I don't want to tell lies.

732
00:48:27,423 --> 00:48:28,815
Then tell the truth.

733
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,478
No one has ever made my
my heart beat faster.

734
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:32,588
Is it that exciting?

735
00:48:32,612 --> 00:48:33,839
Rockin'!

736
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,593
Good. I'm listening.

737
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:38,981
You're not going to tell anyone?

738
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:40,455
I never say anything.

739
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:43,820
Look, the day before yesterday, Juliette
told me, in secret,

740
00:48:43,844 --> 00:48:46,400
that she was in love
with her Uncle Gilbert.

741
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,712
Did I tell you? No.
Then what?

742
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,389
Well, I love a man.

743
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,471
And he loves me.

744
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,275
We spent the night together.
We had breakfast in the countryside.

745
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,351
We took a bath.
We were soaked.

746
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:04,055
- I don't believe you, it's not possible.
- But it's true!

747
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,020
But if it is true, what is exciting about it?

748
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,981
Oh, Professor.
This dog barks day and night.

749
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:14,511
Mr. Bataillon threatens
to press charges.

750
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,693
Go and buy me
cigarettes before they close.

751
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:19,717
Good.

752
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:30,738
So.

753
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,335
Chief, where is the dog?

754
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,989
What dog?

755
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,077
So where did you spend the night?
With whom? It's not Jean-Loup.

756
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,790
A new one?
Did you ever tell me about him?

757
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,113
There may be reasons
why I never talked about it.

758
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:16,728
Is the police looking for him?

759
00:50:16,753 --> 00:50:19,592
My story takes place
internationally.

760
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,472
International...?

761
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,677
International...
I got it!

762
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,354
It is about an atomic scientist

763
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,990
And the spies are trying
to steal his formulas.

764
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,954
Did you meet secretly...

765
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,919
And you changed your
clothes to throw them off!

766
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,993
You always understand everything, you.

767
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,755
Good evening.
Father called twice,

768
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:56,415
The Institute of Physiology three times,
Maubru relentlessly.

769
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,166
If you don't want to tell me where
you spend your days,

770
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:01,680
That's fine, but at least tell me what
I have to answer the phone, right?

771
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,188
This morning, as I was having
breakfast with my future mother-in-law,

772
00:51:21,213 --> 00:51:25,193
I found the Yellow Pages open
under "Investigation and Surveillance."

773
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,295
She is doing the same as with her first husband,
from whom she obtained a divorce.

774
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,321
What do you suspect?

775
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:32,361
All of it!

776
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:36,187
In the lab...
He heard your voice the other night.

777
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:41,517
Yesterday, looking for salt throughout the
house, it did not have a natural air.

778
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,819
I disappeared for the whole day.

779
00:51:43,844 --> 00:51:46,193
In the end, I suggested to her
to take back her word.

780
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:47,815
Did you?

781
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,495
Yes.

782
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,175
Within the framework of the arithmetic
Of the passions?

783
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,071
No, alas!
That was my mistake.

784
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:57,401
Do you still love her?

785
00:51:58,555 --> 00:52:02,015
No, no...
But I have known her since she was a child.

786
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,023
It is his father who has
taught me everything.

787
00:52:04,048 --> 00:52:08,951
When he got divorced,
she asked me to... console her...

788
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,121
I couldn't say no.

789
00:52:11,145 --> 00:52:12,518
And does she love you?

790
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:18,531
No, Edith does not love me.
She loves marriage.

791
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,175
In every quarrel,
you take back your word.

792
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,794
But if I want to break up with her,
she refuses.

793
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,678
You don't know women.

794
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,276
Sorry to hear about your father....
I don't know either...

795
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,322
Go get me the cigarettes.

796
00:52:39,346 --> 00:52:40,986
All right, if I'm in the way...

797
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,880
Care will have to be taken now.

798
00:52:49,904 --> 00:52:51,471
Here it is impossible.

799
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,439
Well, in the city it will be even worse.

800
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,095
The students, the parents.
Not to mention my colleagues!

801
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,370
What if we don't do them?

802
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:03,395
What?

803
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,641
Transformations
in statue with N734.

804
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:07,238
It is out of the question!

805
00:53:07,378 --> 00:53:09,840
After my report
to the Academy of Sciences,

806
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:12,466
The whole world will know about N734.

807
00:53:12,491 --> 00:53:14,032
Then don't do it!

808
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:17,719
But think what benefits
N734 would bring to the world.

809
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:20,541
One million people
on the same plane.

810
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:22,015
No housing problems.

811
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,833
1,000, 2,000, 3,000 people
would sleep in one room.

812
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:28,095
The bathrooms will be
crowded the next morning!

813
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,561
Entire herds could
be sent in postal packages.

814
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:34,107
Entire nations could
be turned into toy soldiers,

815
00:53:34,132 --> 00:53:36,120
If only they would put
N734 into the water pipes.

816
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:38,720
No, no, its use will be regulated
in international conferences.

817
00:53:38,744 --> 00:53:40,876
Start regulating yourself.

818
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,790
That would be wonderful for us.

819
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,319
Suppose you go
to a conference abroad,

820
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,433
And that you take me with
you in your pocket.

821
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,065
Evening revive me.

822
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,800
The next morning, a good
cup of N734 for breakfast,

823
00:53:53,825 --> 00:53:56,997
And poof!
I spend the day in your pocket.

824
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,253
But thinking about it, you could
turn into a statue yourself.

825
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:02,963
No, it is impossible.

826
00:54:02,988 --> 00:54:03,988
Why not?

827
00:54:04,013 --> 00:54:07,271
Because I can't afford
To disappear all night long.

828
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,034
Good. Then I will sacrifice myself.

829
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:14,414
Do you know who suffers when
you are in my pocket? Me.

830
00:54:14,439 --> 00:54:18,476
- But how...?
- You will sleep-alive.

831
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:26,152
Yesterday I discovered what it means to .
to truly love.

832
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,066
When you part from a girl
whom one loves, one suffers to think that

833
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:34,646
someone hurts her,
invite her to dance

834
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:38,695
And she will start lying to him because
he begins to like her....

835
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,375
And when you're in my pockets,
it's much worse.

836
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,152
You are all mine.

837
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,153
Don't leave me, don't betray me.

838
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:52,520
You are so perfect.
But when you're not there.

839
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:55,212
My poor love!

840
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,115
It is good to see you in pain.

841
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,671
It also makes you more beautiful.

842
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,870
How can one resist?

843
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,808
All right, I will destroy the
draft of my report.

844
00:55:08,832 --> 00:55:10,159
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

845
00:55:11,086 --> 00:55:13,350
We find a deserted place.

846
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:16,098
A deserted place...

847
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,066
A deserted place?

848
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,646
The lapidary museum!
It is always empty there.

849
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,828
Me and my first love
kissed each other there.

850
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:30,011
It is evident.
Well, in the museum.

851
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:34,837
So on Friday, I will finish class
at 4:05 p.m. and at 4:20 p.m. I will be at the museum.

852
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,161
You will arrive 10 minutes early.
You will already be transformed.

853
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:40,310
Why first?

854
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,189
Because if he sees us
together a policeman, he will understand.

855
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:49,192
Perfect! You will find me behind the
fountain of St. Victor's Abbey.

856
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:25,606
This is a lapidary museum
and its archaeological garden,

857
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:28,899
contains artifacts from
from excavations in this region.

858
00:56:28,924 --> 00:56:31,892
Here is the spiral column and the
fountain of the Abbey of San Vittore,

859
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,775
Near the walls of the ancient city.

860
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,553
Do not stray too far!
The Parisians entered through this door.

861
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,779
We are now going to see
a series of votive altars...

862
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,598
You will realize that we are no longer
in the realm of assumptions anymore.

863
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,637
So what do you infer from this?

864
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,111
He cheats on you with a girl
Who has a waistline of 50 centimeters.

865
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,421
50? It will be at least 60.
But that is not the question.

866
00:57:35,446 --> 00:57:39,141
I would like to know when, how,
where and with whom he is seeing.

867
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:42,473
There is little that can be done.
There is only one way, make him follow.

868
00:57:42,497 --> 00:57:45,437
Listen.
I found on the directory a small

869
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:49,175
"Eye of the Lynx" agency
which has as its specialty...

870
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,368
A knitted floral specialty...
Oh, honey!

871
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:55,735
Today is like my holiday.

872
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,268
Blue...  is its color.

873
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:01,167
Yes ... I see ... its color ... Yes.
I hope it's your size.

874
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:03,045
This will be fine.

875
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:06,996
Then see you soon, ma'am.
I'll be back later. Good evening.

876
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,898
That's it.

877
00:59:56,213 --> 01:00:00,046
Jeanne! Jeanne!
Where are you? Where are you?

878
01:00:00,366 --> 01:00:04,110
Oh my God, how scary!

879
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,912
A sinister man followed me
followed me all the way!

880
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,341
Look, this is no laughing matter.
You've lost all my stuff.

881
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:19,441
Edith took them.

882
01:00:19,466 --> 01:00:21,495
My belt is
too big for her.

883
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,150
And my scarf is lost.
Ah, it's a tragedy!

884
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,674
It is true, though.

885
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,833
You know, if you're not going to be nice to me,

886
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,354
If you won't be nice to me,
I will go to an antique dealer I know.

887
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,840
He is very kind.

888
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,455
I will drink N734, he will sell me and
I will go around the world sleeping.

889
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,916
A century or two will pass,
I will end up in the sea - and poof!

890
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,671
And you will be far away.

891
01:00:46,695 --> 01:00:47,855
All right, I promise:

892
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,475
next time I will take a
suitcase to put all your things in.

893
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,950
And we will change the meeting place.

894
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:58,159
I will transform at the first station
Of the buses. There is never anyone there.

895
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,420
What are you doing all alone?

896
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:19,077
Don't you have a mom? Huh?

897
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:22,238
Come on, go to your mom. Go!

898
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:04,961
Mirelle! Come and eat!

899
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:07,070
I am bathing
to my dolls!

900
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,678
Mom! Mom! My doll! Mom,
my doll! Where did she go?

901
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:40,628
Mom! Mom! Hurry! Mom,
hurry! Mom! My doll!

902
01:02:40,653 --> 01:02:41,954
Your doll has nothing.

903
01:02:41,978 --> 01:02:46,819
No, I dipped her and she
become a lady!

904
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:47,848
Come on!

905
01:02:47,872 --> 01:02:52,751
There! My doll!
My doll!

906
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,335
My doll!

907
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,606
Here she is, your doll!
Don't make me angry! Let's go!

908
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,768
Mom, an elephant!

909
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:10,360
There is no ele...

910
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,615
Who do you think
Stole this elephant?

911
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:15,833
What elephant?

912
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:16,866
Read.

913
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,635
Oh! He didn't tell me that!

914
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:22,940
Who.
Do you know who stole the elephant?

915
01:03:22,964 --> 01:03:24,583
Uh, I have a suspicion.

916
01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:25,608
You have to tell the police.

917
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:27,592
Are you crazy? Listen to me...

918
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:30,692
Do you love me? You don't want to put me
in the middle of this, do you?

919
01:03:30,717 --> 01:03:34,116
You read too many spy books!

920
01:03:34,263 --> 01:03:35,818
- Hello girls!
- Good morning...

921
01:03:35,843 --> 01:03:37,191
- Shall we have a drink?
- I'm not thirsty.

922
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:39,251
- Strawberry ice cream?
- Yes! - No, I don't want to.

923
01:03:39,276 --> 01:03:41,519
I have forgiven you,
why are you pouting?

924
01:03:41,544 --> 01:03:43,691
I don't have to make it up to you and
I have no reason to be kind.

925
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:45,735
All right, I won't keep up with you.

926
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,196
I know,
you are too busy to forgive.

927
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,080
Here, look: real mobilization.

928
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,794
Stay here.

929
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:04,965
Why did you revive the elephant?

930
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:05,990
Me, no!

931
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:07,375
Look!

932
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,648
Ah, yes, I remember now.

933
01:04:09,672 --> 01:04:12,286
It was when I was angry and I
told Maubru to throw everything away.

934
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,865
But all the drains
flows into the sea!

935
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,073
Busy as usual?
I think I know the young lady.

936
01:04:19,098 --> 01:04:20,899
I will send you my notes by mail.
Good evening.

937
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,194
Good evening...

938
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:25,148
Why did you come looking for me?

939
01:04:25,173 --> 01:04:29,234
On a whim. And then, Anne-Lise
Would like to have a conversation with you.

940
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:32,192
Just a little
business conversation.

941
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,038
Go with Anne-Lise,
we will see you at home.

942
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,959
Good luck!

943
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,589
Goodbye!

944
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,592
You are so interesting...

945
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,015
Interesting?
But if I didn't say anything.

946
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,919
Even when you don't say anything,
you are interesting.

947
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:19,878
Tell me all about yourself.

948
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,035
I thought you were interested in that
little girl, what's her name. Monette.

949
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:27,473
Monette? She is a little girl.
She doesn't understand me.

950
01:05:28,013 --> 01:05:29,721
I am a dreamer.

951
01:05:29,745 --> 01:05:30,775
A dreamer?

952
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,574
This is a bad thing. You will learn
That life is a war to be won.

953
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,609
Yes, my general!
But don't you ever take leave?

954
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:40,634
No.

955
01:05:40,659 --> 01:05:43,540
Ah, I see. You are afraid that
your boyfriend will find me here.

956
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,620
He is talking business
with Anne-Lise.

957
01:05:45,644 --> 01:05:47,895
It will keep him stuck
for at least two hours.

958
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,606
So?
Is it him?

959
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:51,874
No!

960
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,271
Telegram for Mr. Norman.

961
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:03,733
Hello.

962
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,820
Is it serious?

963
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,276
Come on, I'm bored!

964
01:06:28,553 --> 01:06:31,313
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE HUNTING MUSEUM AT 6 O'CLOCK.
PROFESSOR ATOM

965
01:06:31,338 --> 01:06:34,626
I feel lonely!
I am afraid!

966
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,269
Do you know Professor Atomo?

967
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:51,154
A professor, no.
I know a dog. Monette's dog.

968
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,435
Professor Atomo...

969
01:06:55,147 --> 01:06:56,273
Professor Atom!

970
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,238
Stop it!

971
01:07:00,253 --> 01:07:02,708
It's almost 6 o'clock, go home!

972
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:04,241
But it is now 5:35 p.m.!

973
01:07:04,265 --> 01:07:07,528
No, no, no, no,
Jerome might come back. Go!

974
01:07:07,552 --> 01:07:09,153
But you said it was stuck.

975
01:07:09,178 --> 01:07:11,633
Women cannot be
reliance on women.

976
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:13,074
It is so true!

977
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:24,353
6 O'CLOCK HUNTING MUSEUM
NEAR THE RHINOS

978
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:27,346
I'M WAITING FOR YOU - THE COLDNESS OF THE
STONE IS A LEGEND. I BURN

979
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,006
Monette.
I should have guessed that.

980
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:42,597
Good evening Jerome.
Telegram for you.

981
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,275
Hello.
The hunting museum, please.

982
01:09:04,299 --> 01:09:06,466
Yes, I would like to talk to the janitor.

983
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,154
What?
Will you only open at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning?

984
01:09:12,373 --> 01:09:17,194
What about the cleaners?
Ah, they will not arrive until 6 o'clock....

985
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,829
Who do I ask if they find anything?

986
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,920
To the head of security?
Many thanks.

987
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,071
No, sir.

988
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:56,995
He was misinformed.
Contact the prefecture.

989
01:10:57,766 --> 01:11:00,406
For lost items,
no earlier than 3 days.

990
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,766
No, sir, we don't deal with
these things. Just ask Section B.

991
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:08,421
He contacted the wrong office,
sir.

992
01:11:08,446 --> 01:11:11,120
You need to make a complaint
to the police station.

993
01:11:22,226 --> 01:11:26,335
If it's his professor, it changes everything.
I am reserved, very reserved!

994
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,230
Ah! Otherwise I would have
things to say about this girl!

995
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:34,278
He shows up once in a while.
He must have a double life.

996
01:11:34,303 --> 01:11:35,760
When did you last see her?

997
01:11:35,785 --> 01:11:39,266
Monday or Tuesday.
Four days ago.

998
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:41,666
It is becoming a habit.

999
01:11:41,691 --> 01:11:46,030
Please call me when you come back.
Thank you. Good evening, ma'am.

1000
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,310
Atomic espionage? Come, come!

1001
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,650
Sit down and wait.

1002
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,435
- Are you the atomic spy?
- Not me, my best friend.

1003
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,995
Is he reporting it?

1004
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,121
He is in mortal danger!

1005
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:08,081
Professor Norman is
involved in this story.

1006
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:09,354
Norman.

1007
01:12:09,379 --> 01:12:12,335
Commissioner, you should see the
guy I've been questioning for an hour.

1008
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,340
- Who is he.
- A biology professor, Norman.

1009
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:16,556
On the disappearance
Miss Landry.

1010
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,961
It is a case without interest.
It is a simple escape.

1011
01:12:18,986 --> 01:12:20,788
I thought so, too.

1012
01:12:20,812 --> 01:12:23,355
But he looks so strange that
I wonder if he's not involved.

1013
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,495
Okay.

1014
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,415
Maybe. I wouldn't be surprised if
He had strangled the girl.

1015
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,829
After the classic rape.

1016
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,215
- Commissioner Andre.
- Jerome Norman.

1017
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,581
She knows my son. He is following
his course... Francois Andre.

1018
01:12:47,606 --> 01:12:49,868
Curly blondie.
His father's portrait.

1019
01:12:49,893 --> 01:12:51,108
Ah, yes, yes, yes...

1020
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,466
I heard about yesterday's misunderstanding,

1021
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:54,516
a mistake for which I wanted to
apologize in person.

1022
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:56,054
Don't worry.

1023
01:12:56,078 --> 01:12:58,196
After all, we are almost colleagues.

1024
01:12:58,221 --> 01:12:59,766
We both do research.

1025
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,808
This case...
is of no interest.

1026
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:05,568
The girl must be living the perfect
romance with a rogue

1027
01:13:05,593 --> 01:13:10,826
Or she will be found in a few
days in a ditch, torn to pieces.

1028
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,313
The police find out everything.

1029
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,349
Do you feel ill?

1030
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,728
So, professor...?

1031
01:13:18,752 --> 01:13:20,761
No, no, excuse me,
it's hot in here.

1032
01:13:20,786 --> 01:13:22,348
But he is trembling.

1033
01:13:22,372 --> 01:13:23,753
But no, no, not at all.

1034
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,055
I'll take care of it.
Julien, go get some cognac.

1035
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,326
No, no, no, you are very kind.
But I am better now, thank you!

1036
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,801
Commissioner, you told me that the
police always find out everything, right?

1037
01:13:37,826 --> 01:13:39,895
Everything. Are you looking for something?

1038
01:13:39,919 --> 01:13:45,079
Yes, Monette. She is my assistant,
Ms. Landry.

1039
01:13:46,406 --> 01:13:49,695
Commissioner, I ask you to find it!

1040
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,466
Was she a collaborator
so valuable?

1041
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,115
Please, Commissioner,
don't talk about her in the past tense.

1042
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,273
I -- I love her so much.

1043
01:13:59,298 --> 01:14:00,973
I thought I had
read the other day

1044
01:14:00,998 --> 01:14:03,815
the announcement of his marriage
to another person.

1045
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,221
Yes but it is Miss.
Monette Landry that I'm going to marry.

1046
01:14:07,245 --> 01:14:09,513
I asked my fiancée
to dissolve the promise.

1047
01:14:09,538 --> 01:14:10,800
Did she refuse?

1048
01:14:10,824 --> 01:14:13,775
Yes. In order not to quarrel
With his family,

1049
01:14:13,799 --> 01:14:16,479
I stopped living with
them and decided to wait

1050
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,598
the first opportunity that would
advantage with my fiancée.

1051
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,835
He has a very violent character.

1052
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:24,281
At this time he had
clandestine meetings...

1053
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:26,648
- ...with Ms. Landry?
- Yes.

1054
01:14:26,673 --> 01:14:28,032
In short, he is insinuating

1055
01:14:28,057 --> 01:14:31,055
That his fiancée might have
have made her rival disappear?

1056
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,715
Not at all!

1057
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:34,508
Then it is you who killed her!

1058
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:37,612
Let's face it.
She had a lover who was pushing her to marry her.

1059
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:39,414
His fiancée
threatened a scandal,

1060
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:41,234
he felt obliged
by his parents,

1061
01:14:41,258 --> 01:14:42,583
Therefore, he killed the girl.

1062
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,335
But-but-but it's not true!

1063
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:45,895
Then explain this disappearance!

1064
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,375
I -- I can't.

1065
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,320
When did you last see
Miss Landry the last time?

1066
01:14:51,345 --> 01:14:54,906
4 a.m. Monday at the university.

1067
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:55,931
What did he do next?

1068
01:14:55,956 --> 01:14:59,101
I had a business interview
with a friend of my girlfriend's.

1069
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:01,179
What time was it?

1070
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:03,781
Eh... 5 p.m.

1071
01:15:03,805 --> 01:15:05,528
What's next?

1072
01:15:05,552 --> 01:15:08,453
- I went back to the lab afterwards.
- Did anyone see her?

1073
01:15:08,477 --> 01:15:12,015
No, the lab assistant
finished work at 6 p.m.

1074
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,941
In short, he has no
alibi between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.

1075
01:15:15,672 --> 01:15:17,176
Let's continue!

1076
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,815
Since he does not want to help us,
I am obliged despite myself

1077
01:15:20,839 --> 01:15:22,455
To put her under arrest.

1078
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,993
Do you have anything to say?

1079
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,401
Can I notify the dean?

1080
01:15:26,425 --> 01:15:27,425
Here it is.

1081
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,606
Hello. I would like to speak to
Dean Geran, please.

1082
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,195
Yes, who is this?

1083
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:45,460
Is that you, Edith?

1084
01:15:45,485 --> 01:15:47,013
Yes, where are you, honey?

1085
01:15:47,037 --> 01:15:49,393
I'm not going home tonight.
They arrested me.

1086
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,666
Arrested? Why?

1087
01:15:51,691 --> 01:15:53,826
I am accused of the
disappearance of my assistant.

1088
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:55,239
Stay where you are. Coming.

1089
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,480
How-what do you mean come? Edith.

1090
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:05,095
Good morning, Mr. Commissioner.
Edith Geran, the girlfriend.

1091
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,255
Oh, my poor darling.
I did it as fast as I could.

1092
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,317
Oh, very nice! What is it?

1093
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,866
Ashtray.
The murder weapon.

1094
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,598
Fascinating.

1095
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,908
Well, so do I, Commissioner,

1096
01:16:20,932 --> 01:16:24,833
I have something to tell you,
which will thrill you.

1097
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,549
To make a long story short, my darling,
the commissioner accuses you

1098
01:16:29,573 --> 01:16:32,921
Of a childish tryst
between you and your assistant.

1099
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:34,886
Look, Edith, this is not the time.

1100
01:16:35,326 --> 01:16:38,441
I have come to provide them,
Mr. Commissioner,

1101
01:16:38,466 --> 01:16:43,150
proof that my fiancé is
innocent of the crime he is accused of.

1102
01:16:44,453 --> 01:16:53,796
This is because of a little thing
that can be found here. Here it is.

1103
01:16:55,173 --> 01:16:57,526
Here is the result of
a small survey.

1104
01:16:58,769 --> 01:17:02,870
I like the certainty. I had some
doubts, and I realized that between certainty

1105
01:17:02,894 --> 01:17:06,995
and doubts there is a difference
of 3,000 francs per day.

1106
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:11,260
Those 3,000 francs demanded
by the agency Eye of the Lynx,

1107
01:17:11,285 --> 01:17:15,637
of your colleagues, Mr.
Commissioner, to supervise someone.

1108
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,355
From 4 p.m. June 25

1109
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:23,053
the agency Eye of the Lynx
watches over my fiancé.

1110
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:29,711
From these papers I will read you an
excerpt from their first report.

1111
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,346
On June 25 at 4 p.m., Prof.
Norman was joined

1112
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:37,479
by our client who met him
met him in the university courtyard.

1113
01:17:37,504 --> 01:17:40,313
After a very brief conversation
with a young blonde woman,

1114
01:17:40,338 --> 01:17:44,116
takes a cab, which takes him
takes him to the research laboratory.

1115
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,148
After realizing that there is no
there is no other way to leave the premises,

1116
01:17:47,172 --> 01:17:49,126
We lurk in front of the door.

1117
01:17:49,151 --> 01:17:54,751
Afterwards, the professor leaves to go to
his house, where he stays all evening.

1118
01:17:54,776 --> 01:17:56,697
The reading of these
documents is tedious.

1119
01:17:56,721 --> 01:17:58,537
You can read them yourself,
commissioner.

1120
01:17:58,562 --> 01:18:02,250
He will observe that as of
4 p.m. June 25,

1121
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:05,495
When Miss, what's her name,
Monette was still alive,

1122
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,510
My fiancé never saw her again.

1123
01:18:07,535 --> 01:18:11,714
Consequently, he did not rape her,
did not kidnap her, did not kill her.

1124
01:18:11,739 --> 01:18:12,739
That's it.

1125
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,875
Commissioner, we found
a rhinoceros in the old harbor!

1126
01:18:18,133 --> 01:18:20,405
How did you know
that June 26 was

1127
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,701
the day of my last
meeting with Monette?

1128
01:18:22,726 --> 01:18:25,375
Because the report mentioned it.

1129
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,806
And did you continue to spy on me, knowing
That I had never seen you again?

1130
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:31,465
I was too amused
to read that you visited

1131
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:34,344
the police station,
the lost and found, the antique dealer!

1132
01:18:35,647 --> 01:18:37,046
Perfect!

1133
01:18:38,299 --> 01:18:41,417
Is this your thanks
For getting you out of prison!

1134
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,196
I was wondering how long it would take you
to think about the ads.

1135
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,921
"Big reward to the person who finds
the figurine of a naked woman..."

1136
01:18:57,946 --> 01:18:59,507
Then do you know?

1137
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:02,175
Honey, you have no secrets from me.

1138
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,511
I should have figured it out.
You were the one who took it.

1139
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,079
Where is it!

1140
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,002
Let go of me! You're hurting me!

1141
01:19:09,027 --> 01:19:10,027
Where is it?

1142
01:19:10,052 --> 01:19:11,238
I took it to the bank!

1143
01:19:11,838 --> 01:19:13,565
Then let's go there now! Now!

1144
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:16,615
It is too late. The banks are
already closed. And listen carefully...

1145
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,606
I will never give you back that
statuette. Do you hear me? Never!

1146
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,595
You are committing a crime.

1147
01:19:22,619 --> 01:19:24,077
Oh, yeah? And where is the body?

1148
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,035
You are stealing a girl's life!

1149
01:19:26,059 --> 01:19:27,790
She stole my fiancé!

1150
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:31,046
I will give her back her life when
I get my fiancé back.

1151
01:19:34,873 --> 01:19:38,873
Ah, all right...
Come on, dictate your terms.

1152
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,527
First, we will get away
from this little charmer.

1153
01:19:43,552 --> 01:19:46,435
Anne-lise and her husband invited us
to spend the vacations in America.

1154
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,460
And what are we going to do there?

1155
01:19:47,485 --> 01:19:48,626
We are going to get married.

1156
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,115
On our return,
we will move to Paris.

1157
01:19:51,139 --> 01:19:52,794
How, and why?

1158
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,557
We will work together at Juvacola.
I will become an advertising executive.

1159
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,480
After one year, hopefully,

1160
01:20:00,599 --> 01:20:04,558
I will send the figurine to mom with
your CPR instructions.

1161
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,555
And... what if I refuse?

1162
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,612
I am the mistress of the situation.
In that case, I would leave.

1163
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,360
And your figurine...

1164
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,352
Good. I accept.

1165
01:20:21,377 --> 01:20:24,477
Here it is...
I finally recognize you.

1166
01:20:24,502 --> 01:20:27,837
This girl has had
a hateful influence on you.

1167
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,615
You know, I was so sure
to bring you back into the fold

1168
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,846
that I have prepared a
bottle of champagne.

1169
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,470
I am glad that
you said yes.

1170
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,836
It would have been very unpleasant to do
what I had decided to do.

1171
01:20:44,613 --> 01:20:46,047
What had you decided?

1172
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:48,767
The moment my
ship had left port,

1173
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:51,053
I would have thrown the figurine into the sea.

1174
01:20:51,077 --> 01:20:52,514
To us!

1175
01:21:10,086 --> 01:21:14,695
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

1176
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,835
Where are the others?

1177
01:21:15,859 --> 01:21:17,314
What others?

1178
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,666
Two dark bags
and the three black suitcases.

1179
01:21:19,691 --> 01:21:23,932
The gentleman's? The gentleman
took them back five minutes ago.

1180
01:21:23,957 --> 01:21:25,108
Isn't he going with you?

1181
01:21:25,132 --> 01:21:27,231
It is not possible!

1182
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:28,505
Do you have my bag, Mom?

1183
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:30,152
Yes, but I don't understand it.

1184
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:31,557
You don't have to understand.

1185
01:21:31,582 --> 01:21:35,273
If Jerome wants to take it from you, don't
let him do so for any reason.

1186
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:39,595
Ah...

1187
01:21:39,619 --> 01:21:41,448
I'm not leaving.
I have changed my mind.

1188
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:45,055
But my dear, everything has been arranged
For your departure. You are expected!

1189
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,652
And then you signed a contract.

1190
01:21:46,677 --> 01:21:48,914
Edith did it.
She signed the contract.

1191
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:54,168
My husband will sue you! You have
making fun of us! Raymond! Raymond!

1192
01:21:54,193 --> 01:21:57,808
Do you know what you are doing? As soon as we
we set sail, the statuette will go overboard.

1193
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:59,575
I don't like to travel.

1194
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:04,312
And you won't, you wouldn't dare to throw it
Into this terrible salt sea.

1195
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:06,143
We shall see!

1196
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:07,445
I bet not.

1197
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:08,952
And I bet it does.

1198
01:22:08,976 --> 01:22:10,015
You break my heart.

1199
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,649
I love to do that.

1200
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:14,091
Edith, give it back to me.

1201
01:22:14,116 --> 01:22:15,274
No!

1202
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:19,704
Don't you have anything else to say?
Have you thought it through?

1203
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:22,049
Perfect!

1204
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,869
My bag...

1205
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:38,846
Haven't you changed your mind?

1206
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,255
Quick! Follow that ship!

1207
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,688
But he goes to America.

1208
01:22:57,713 --> 01:22:59,318
I'll stop you first.

1209
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,059
Drop it!

1210
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,146
Let it fall! Let it fall! Let it fall!

1211
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,512
Allow me, miss!

1212
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:33,295
Thank you. But aren't you Alberic
Cahuzac? But yes, I recognize her!

1213
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,121
Oh, you were at my conference?

1214
01:23:35,146 --> 01:23:38,466
Of course. I subscribe to all
Alliance Française events.

1215
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:40,721
Aren't we going too far?

1216
01:23:40,745 --> 01:23:42,767
Go ahead. I will give you double.

1217
01:23:42,792 --> 01:23:45,527
I was afraid that the topic
was a little difficult

1218
01:23:45,551 --> 01:23:47,912
for ears
so fascinating.

1219
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,721
But no!

1220
01:23:49,745 --> 01:23:52,438
"The influence of epic myth
on Roman literature."

1221
01:23:52,463 --> 01:23:53,772
Nothing more interesting.

1222
01:23:53,797 --> 01:23:55,591
But what does it do!

1223
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,551
Faster! Faster!

1224
01:23:57,576 --> 01:24:00,722
Hey, hey, if we continue,
I will break my engine.

1225
01:24:00,747 --> 01:24:04,582
Will you allow me to look at it?
It is a lovely object.

1226
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,474
One could fall in love
with this little object.

1227
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,335
No, no, it's not a big deal.

1228
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:11,973
Wait, wait...

1229
01:24:11,998 --> 01:24:13,673
- Oh no!
- I am desolated!

1230
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:16,461
Finally!

1231
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:18,735
Do you often schedule
appointments on the high seas?

1232
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,717
This is the first and last time.

1233
