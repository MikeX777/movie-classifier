1
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:56,810
You must always pay attention
and behave yourself.

2
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:58,962
If you behave, you'll not have
to come back here.

3
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,608
And if you have bad thoughts,
get rid of them.

4
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:06,099
Take a walk, shake you head,
whatever.

5
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,661
I prefer that you'll
never come back.

6
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:23,039
Got it?

7
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,440
I'd rather never see you again.

8
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,296
Anyway, we had a good time here.

9
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:37,523
Yes, not bad.

10
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,117
Give your mother
what you made for her.

11
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:15,136
-Thank you!
-For the cigarettes.

12
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:17,839
We made it at the workshop
of Occupational Therapy.

13
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,514
Muchas gracias.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,185
You can put the packet inside
and the brand won't show.

15
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:24,701
Can I have one?

16
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,906
THE GARDEN

17
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:56,521
Madam,
you have a phone call.

18
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,236
Hold me, look how I am.

19
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:05,278
Hello. How I are you?

20
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:09,422
Good. Yes, we got here fine.

21
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:13,058
Yes, Liso is alright.

22
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:16,058
He even has put on some weight.

23
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,273
He'll visit you soon.

24
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:24,877
Then you can take a walk together,
I told him.

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,156
I have to go, I'm busy.

26
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,122
Kisses, bye.

27
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:35,787
Bye.

28
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:38,795
Push the "off" button.

29
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,416
Sonia is glad that you're home,
right, Sonia?

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,133
Yes, madam.

31
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,309
I am exhausted.

32
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,710
Animals are quite something.

33
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,686
Open the window
to air the room.

34
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:27,936
And take this to the kitchen,
your father doesn't like...

35
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:29,645
...that I smoke in here.

36
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,323
Your mother gave you a nice present.

37
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:04,329
If you want, I can take you
for a ride.

38
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,267
No, I´m afraid.

39
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,135
-Are you afraid?
-Yes...

40
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:11,214
It´s nice.

41
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:16,383
If you promise me to go slow, OK.

42
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,833
I'll ride slowly.

43
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:21,173
50

44
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:25,946
No, I prefer to ride slower

45
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:29,194
25? Is that possible?

46
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,867
I have to practice a little bit more.

47
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,747
THE BIKE

48
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:14,671
What are you doing?

49
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:17,031
Nothing, I was looking at you.

50
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:18,318
At whom?

51
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,178
I was looking at you.

52
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,509
What is this?

53
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:28,577
A bike.

54
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:30,704
I can see that, but where it came from?

55
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,054
A present.

56
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,727
Did you go out?

57
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:42,831
I did.

58
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,632
Here I am.

59
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:47,997
But I am not here anymore.

60
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:57,746
I'm better, you know.
I'm on medication.

61
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm not doing very well
since the last time.

62
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,341
Can I give you a kiss?

63
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,281
What?

64
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:17,531
Can I give you a kiss?
The last one and then I'll go...

65
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,960
and you'll never see me again.

66
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:25,089
You don't realize what you
have done to me, do you?

67
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:31,566
Yes or no?

68
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:32,591
Yes.

69
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,726
It's hard for me
to get my life back.

70
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:54,797
Sure.

71
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,978
-That you are lacking something?
-Yes.

72
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:06,561
That you have to think
about something...

73
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,024
Yes.

74
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,588
I can't get used to some things.

75
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,783
But if you eat well
and take the medicines...

76
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,614
-Are you taking them?
-Yes, I do.

77
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:26,836
That's very important.

78
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,861
You think that the medicines
won't do any good...

79
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,608
But medicines and exercises
are very good.

80
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:36,764
You should never stay...

81
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:39,829
...quiet.

82
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,968
Did you ever think about
meeting somebody else?

83
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,734
No, no.

84
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:50,565
You never felt the need
for another love?

85
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,840
No.

86
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,115
I'm fine, I like men.

87
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:59,220
I like to be nice to them
so they won't think that I...

88
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:03,032
Not long ago, a guy wanted
to buy me an ice cream.

89
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,482
Not long ago, a guy wanted
to buy me an ice cream.

90
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:09,090
He was very nice...
but no, better not.

91
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,473
Sonia!

92
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:44,155
Did you touch at my charcoals
when you did the cleaning?

93
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:17,501
Forget it, Sonia.

94
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:00,453
FLOWERS

95
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,478
Load the gun.

96
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:14,620
Get in position.

97
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,634
This side forward.

98
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:25,130
Take aim.

99
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,876
Loosen your elbows a bit.

100
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,678
Your pulse is not steady.

101
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:34,494
Take aim... shoot.

102
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:49,737
Take the magazine out.

103
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,568
That's it.

104
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,225
Excuse me.

105
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,914
Are you spying on me?

106
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,136
I could spend my whole life looking
at you in your sleep.

107
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,537
I am jealous of the women
who watch you in your sleep.

108
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,576
When you were a baby...

109
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:25,128
I spend hours looking at you
in your sleep.

110
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:29,755
I looked at you
and I couldn't believe it.

111
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,443
All the time I wanted
to wake up your father...

112
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:41,111
Wake him up and ask him:
"How did this child appear?

113
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,029
Where came something
so beautiful from?"

114
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,088
What a bore...

115
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:04,307
If you don't want to work anymore...

116
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:08,207
if you don't want to study
or do anything, tell me.

117
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,847
Everything will be alright,

118
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,386
what you do and
what you don't do.

119
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:27,309
If you don't want to live anymore,
you should tell me.

120
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,025
Don't keep it to yourself.

121
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,795
You should live
like the boys of your age.

122
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,249
Go out and things like that.

123
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,824
You can't be locked in here
all your life.

124
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,819
You want to smoke?

125
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:30,569
You used to have friends,
a girlfriend...

126
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,046
Yes, I used to have...

127
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,366
Are you sleeping well?

128
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,538
Yes, I feel better.

129
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:45,772
-You feel better?
-Yes

130
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:02,182
Take this, go out and have fun.

131
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,925
Please, take it.

132
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,192
Find yourself a girl and everything.

133
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:15,085
Here's some more,
in case the girl's expensive.

134
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,452
I like your house.

135
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:36,402
It is not my house.

136
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:39,930
It's nice.

137
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:55,985
No smoking.

138
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,889
There are candies there,
take some if you want.

139
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:10,445
It's OK, thanks.

140
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,144
What is your name?

141
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,318
Sofía.

142
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:17,506
Sofía.

143
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:20,803
Is it your only name?

144
00:24:33,087 --> 00:24:35,170
No kisses, I told you.

145
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:33,456
You are sad.

146
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,455
You are very cute...

147
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:42,977
You should find yourself
a girlfriend.

148
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,277
You have no need to pay.

149
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:00,741
Are you studying or working?

150
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,208
-You are not studying or working?
-No

151
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:10,743
-But you must be doing something.
-No, nothing.

152
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:12,748
Everybody does something.

153
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,645
I do this because I study,
for instance.

154
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,493
I go to Law School.

155
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:22,823
Is there nothing
you would like to do?

156
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,633
You should think about it.

157
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:34,454
What is this?

158
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,360
Eyes.

159
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,509
How strange.

160
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:41,053
I had another tattoo
beneath this one.

161
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:42,953
It was the face of Maradona.

162
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:45,764
It was badly done.

163
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:48,715
Show me the one on your back.

164
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,274
What is it?

165
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:01,623
My grandfather's face.

166
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:05,765
Why your grandfather?

167
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,089
He never asked me anything.

168
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:10,409
Good luck.

169
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:31,710
TIME

170
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,691
I brought you a glass of milk.

171
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:46,871
Thanks.

172
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:00,603
Are you still not sleeping?

173
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:03,645
Now I'm sleeping a little bit.

174
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,262
Are you taking your pills?

175
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:16,004
Yes, I do.

176
00:29:45,654 --> 00:29:47,321
I like this.

177
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:51,686
The needles.

178
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:54,132
The little box.

179
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:56,582
Yes, it's nice.

180
00:30:00,254 --> 00:30:01,921
And this?

181
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,776
To thread the needle.

182
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:08,655
If you can't thread it,
you use this.

183
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,216
You pass it through the needle.
and that's it.

184
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:16,269
Very easy.

185
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:22,026
For those
who don't have good eyesight.

186
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:25,733
I think I have good eyesight.

187
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:27,886
Can you thread one?

188
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,511
-You let me try?
-Yes.

189
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:49,282
They say you should never thread
the needle with your hand.

190
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:51,446
-Bad luck?
-Yes.

191
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,038
If you do, you'll split
with your best friend.

192
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:02,997
Because needle and thread
are good friends.

193
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,529
-Can you?
-No.

194
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:19,971
-You don't have good eyesight.
-More or less...

195
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:25,184
-My hand is shaking.
-Why?

196
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:28,895
Because you smoke too much,
that's why.

197
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,504
You're nervous.

198
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,597
-Nervous.
-Yes.

199
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:35,919
This one shakes more
than this one.

200
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,584
Can you do this?

201
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,489
I'm making this outfit
for my daughter.

202
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,991
She is devoted
to the Virgin of Copacabana.

203
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:59,727
She dances.
Let's see.

204
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,775
My hands are a bit clumsy.

205
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,738
Forward.

206
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,293
They are rude.

207
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:19,099
Hands are never rude or clumsy.

208
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:38,003
There...

209
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:42,063
No... stop.

210
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,464
You got lost.

211
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:00,465
-Do you know Bolivia?
-No.

212
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:02,588
It is very nice.

213
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:06,006
Are you homesick?

214
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,452
Yes, I miss my country.

215
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:14,299
But...

216
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,917
I hope that some day
I will go back there.

217
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,478
I live with my memories.

218
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,486
Do you have memories?

219
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,433
Yes.

220
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,000
I have seven brothers.

221
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:35,192
-That's a lot.
-Yes.

222
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:37,217
You could lend me one.

223
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:40,534
A brother?
They are grown up now.

224
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:43,932
-I'm the youngest.
-Yes?

225
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:45,332
Yes.

226
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:12,693
The Virgin of Copacabana
is in La Paz.

227
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:21,922
If you want, some day
we'll go with your family

228
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:24,226
and I'll show you Bolivia.

229
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:30,710
What?

230
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:34,787
Are you thinking of Bolivia?

231
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:38,329
No, I'm calm.

232
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,628
My mind went blank.

233
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:41,529
I never understood
what happened between us.

234
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,404
Why it didn't work.

235
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:49,463
I don't know, sometimes I wonder.
Not very often.

236
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:54,156
But when I'm alone...

237
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,148
I think of you.

238
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:20,548
You can see the sky from here,

239
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:24,755
I like that.

240
00:36:25,946 --> 00:36:28,120
In my house you don't see it
like this.

241
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:20,043
I don't want you to sleep here.

242
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:22,077
Why?

243
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:24,677
Because tomorrow arrives Julian
and I don't want to.

244
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:27,924
There's a couch in the living room.

245
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:30,241
You can stay there until daybreak.

246
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,717
It's not right to come
without letting me know.

247
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:26,476
Wake up!

248
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,743
It's raining fire!
Fire and blood!

249
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,726
-What are you saying?
-Everything is red.

250
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:35,251
We have to get out of here.

251
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:37,193
-This is the end.
-No! Enough!

252
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:39,176
-Enough!
-We have to get out of here.

253
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,355
You are not well,
you must leave.

254
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,335
Come on.

255
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,929
THE CHILDREN

256
00:43:08,783 --> 00:43:10,695
What do you want, Ivonne?

257
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:14,569
-Tutuca?
-Tutuca

258
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,218
The colored one.

259
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:05,444
That's you.

260
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:08,858
You must have been
three or four years old.

261
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,937
If you look carefully,
you'll see that you're smiling.

262
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:35,861
That's it!

263
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:37,098
Very good.

264
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:41,316
Liso!

265
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:44,988
Sonia!

266
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:35,949
I woke up a while ago
and you weren't here.

267
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:40,400
Neither you or Liso.

268
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:48,595
But madam, today is my day off.

269
00:48:55,628 --> 00:48:59,545
-Why are you sad, madam?
-I'm worried about my son.

270
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:05,452
He will change.

271
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:06,977
I hope so.

272
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,878
We'll give him time.

273
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,547
Madam.

274
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:27,664
What?

275
00:49:27,957 --> 00:49:31,166
I want to tell you
that I'm going back to Bolivia.

276
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,455
What? Back to Bolivia?

277
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,627
Why?

278
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:42,357
Because I am homesick.

279
00:49:43,045 --> 00:49:45,836
What do you miss?

280
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:49,413
Everything, madam.

281
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:53,957
Everything, madam.

282
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:16,243
CEREMONIES

283
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:45,514
It's time you start to work,
don't you think?

284
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,578
You could come a couple
of days a week to help me.

285
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,215
Sure, if you want...

286
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:54,289
I could come.

287
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:57,114
And what do you want?

288
00:50:57,581 --> 00:50:59,365
Do you prefer to be in the hospital?

289
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,765
No.

290
00:51:01,212 --> 00:51:02,470
What do you want?

291
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:04,386
You must want something.

292
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,373
Nothing, I don't want anything.

293
00:51:10,094 --> 00:51:11,469
Nothing.

294
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:14,168
Does nothing interest you?

295
00:51:14,412 --> 00:51:16,828
You can't live
if nothing interests you.

296
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:23,806
I would like to have a child.

297
00:51:24,307 --> 00:51:25,865
What are you saying?

298
00:51:28,173 --> 00:51:30,215
I would like to have a child.

299
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:33,936
You can't have a child
in your condition.

300
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,221
Besides, you don't have somebody.

301
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:38,487
Sure.

302
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,705
You screwed everything.

303
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,642
You play the madman,
you have no willpower.

304
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,817
Sometimes I get tired too,
you know?

305
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,180
I do...

306
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:54,755
but I have no way out.

307
00:51:55,617 --> 00:51:59,409
Go up every morning and move on,
if I want it or not.

308
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,509
I have to go on.

309
00:52:05,402 --> 00:52:06,580
Sure.

310
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:29,241
THE RIVER

311
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,141
Do you want to say goodbye to granny
one more time?

312
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:48,019
No, it's OK.

313
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,983
Did you see that Marina is here?

314
00:56:57,587 --> 00:57:00,587
You liked her so much
when you were little.

315
00:57:04,433 --> 00:57:06,642
She has two children, you know?

316
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:14,293
She'd like to say hello.

317
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,813
I heard about the hospital.

318
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,005
It was hard, wasn't it?

319
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:12,304
It's over now.

320
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:19,955
You look good.

321
00:59:05,027 --> 00:59:06,626
What are you doing?

322
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,938
I came to say goodbye.

323
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:35,160
I'm going to Bolivia.

324
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:40,999
I'm going with you.

325
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:44,322
What are you saying?

326
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:46,688
What are you going to do
in Bolivia?

327
01:02:12,552 --> 01:02:14,635
These are clothes
I don't wear any more.

328
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,206
I don't know what weather
you have there...

329
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:19,147
but I'm sure you can use them.

330
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:21,339
Thank you so much, madam,
God bless you.

331
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,408
Are you out of your mind?

332
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:46,199
Shoot!
Go ahead, shoot me!

333
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:47,866
Shoot!

334
01:03:38,558 --> 01:03:43,994
LA PAZ

335
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:33,375
-Four multiplied by eight?
-¡32!

336
01:05:33,748 --> 01:05:38,216
-36... 40, 44...!
-What?

337
01:05:40,193 --> 01:05:41,443
An eagle!

338
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:43,183
Four by eight?

339
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:46,479
-32!
-36!

340
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,360
36 is wrong.

341
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:53,109
-Four multiplied by nine?
-40!

342
01:05:53,134 --> 01:05:54,842
36!

343
01:05:56,803 --> 01:05:59,220
-Four multiplied by nine?
-36!

344
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,439
-Is eight plus one = seven?
-Nine!

345
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,217
-You.
-Nine!

346
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,565
Very good.

347
01:06:08,383 --> 01:06:10,091
Four multiplied by three?

348
01:06:11,507 --> 01:06:13,132
12.

349
01:06:13,157 --> 01:06:14,823
Four by three = 12.

350
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:25,562
Your father says hello.

351
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:29,897
He is sad because of what happened.

352
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:33,118
OK. Forget it.

353
01:06:41,176 --> 01:06:43,051
I thought you quit smoking.

354
01:06:44,998 --> 01:06:47,082
You can't quit everything.

355
01:06:52,237 --> 01:06:54,320
Do you feel good here?

356
01:06:55,568 --> 01:06:58,221
Yes, very good.

357
01:07:00,465 --> 01:07:01,548
I'm fine.

358
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,684
You could have done the same thing
without going so far.

359
01:07:05,136 --> 01:07:08,011
You think there are
no poor people in Argentina?

360
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:09,642
Stop it, Mom.
