1
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,577
But Carol, this bank is your guardian.

2
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,582
We're living in 1932.

3
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:01,943
But you persist in spending money as
if it were still '29. Before the crash.

4
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:04,615
You forced me to
eliminate your charities.

5
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,450
Even your father's most beloved project.
The Morgan Home for girls.

6
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:09,435
Fine.

7
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,199
I don't believe in delinquent
girls. Silly weaklings.

8
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:19,423
We know 29% of them went on the streets
as they didn't have a bed to sleep in.

9
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:22,108
Nonsense. They've got no character.

10
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,897
Neglect your character and
you lose your self-respect.

11
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,812
If you go out on to the streets,
you end up in the gutter.

12
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,500
Where, I might add, you jolly
well deserve to end up.

13
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:37,227
Hello .. hello? Carol?

14
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:40,330
Hung up on me.

15
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,001
In these days it's .. indecent.

16
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:44,913
Look at those.

17
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,659
Lovely girls .. got spoiled.

18
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:50,506
Superficial.

19
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:52,639
Well.

20
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:57,111
I hope her first lesson isn't the brutal
relations between money and friends.

21
00:02:58,146 --> 00:02:59,443
Mr William Wade, please.

22
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:01,873
Miss Morgan speaking.

23
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:04,902
But Dixon old boy, times are tough.

24
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:06,910
People aren't spending.

25
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:10,600
You've got to compose copy that
drags money out of their pockets.

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,291
Alright. See me about it
at nine in the morning.

27
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:16,528
Hello.

28
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:20,291
Hello, darling. I've time for
twenty words. No more, no less.

29
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,831
Mr Bill Wade invites Miss
Carol Morgan to dine tonight.

30
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:25,116
Providing Mr Wade can
get to bed by midnight.

31
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,548
Mr Wade having averaged four
hours sleep a night for the past week.

32
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,420
Hang up on me, would you?

33
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:37,087
Bill Wade, I'll get you for this.

34
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:56,910
Bill.

35
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:59,716
Out of all the house, this part is me.

36
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:01,327
Look.

37
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,858
Like it?

38
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,148
Yes, yes .. colossal.

39
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:20,294
Sit down and stay a while.
- Here?

40
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,393
Send a man to get me
in about five minutes.

41
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,160
Sleepy, Bill?

42
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,004
Practically Rip Van Winkle.

43
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,802
I have nice feet, haven't I? Huh?

44
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,896
You can't expect a man
to write poetry about feet.

45
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:47,199
At five o'clock in the morning.

46
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:53,069
Bill.

47
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,496
Uhuh?

48
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,834
I've never seen you before
with your eyes closed.

49
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:09,696
Bill.

50
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:13,267
I'm 24 years old and I've taken
pretty good care of myself.

51
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,306
I .. don't drink.

52
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,924
Except half a cocktail, once in a while.

53
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:19,486
I don't smoke.

54
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,554
I go to church on Sundays.

55
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:22,856
And.

56
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,806
I'm awfully kind to dumb animals.

57
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:26,700
And I love you so much.

58
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:28,024
Bill.

59
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:29,505
Darling.

60
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,549
I know you are awfully busy but ..

61
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,542
Couldn't we just take five minutes
off tomorrow and .. marry?

62
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,453
Bill, marry me tomorrow.

63
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:40,758
Take me to Monte Carlo.

64
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,798
Where we can doze in the sun.

65
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,005
Swim together in the moonlight.

66
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:48,029
And be all alone just by ourselves.

67
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:50,694
Bill.

68
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,135
The Mediterranean is awfully blue.

69
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:55,924
Bill.

70
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:58,368
Bill!

71
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,784
Do you think it's very nice to sleep
when a girl is asking you to marry her?

72
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:10,380
Would you really marry me, Carol?

73
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:21,355
Am I the luckiest fool in the world?

74
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:23,465
No .. lucky me.

75
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:24,739
When?

76
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,881
Any living minute you say.
- Tomorrow.

77
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:29,017
You mean today, don't you?

78
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,568
Morning Pictorial.
- Evening News.

79
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,178
Say, how about seeing Miss Morgan?
- The Times wants her picture.

80
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:40,986
No.

81
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:42,269
Have a heart.

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,832
When Miss Morgan says she
won't see any newspapermen ..

83
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,117
She means she won't
see any newspapermen.

84
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,919
After all, this is The Times ..

85
00:06:58,523 --> 00:06:59,605
Step aside, there.

86
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:01,125
Good evening, Mr Wade.

87
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,476
It's Wade.
- Come on, give us a story.

88
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,470
Morning Pictorial.
- Evening News.

89
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,833
How about a story?

90
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:09,709
What do you want? Little Red Riding
Hood or the story of the Three Bears?

91
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,540
No: 'Multimillionaire's granddaughter
marries struggling Ad writer'.

92
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,095
Come on, everyone knows.
Winchell spilled it on the radio.

93
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:16,190
He did?

94
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,939
You may say for me that this
is the happiest day of my life.

95
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,290
Come on, have a heart.
- Give us a break.

96
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,277
Could I get a picture of you
climbing out of the Rolls Royce?

97
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,367
Nothing doing.
- Climbing out of your own car?

98
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,535
Just a little picture.
- Alright.

99
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,368
Now right this way Mr Wade
please .. and smile.

100
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:39,388
Where will the honeymoon wax and wane?

101
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,780
There will be no honeymoon.
The bridegroom is too busy.

102
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,627
Please, Mr Wade .. and smile.

103
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,437
Are you going to continue working?

104
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,268
No offense, Mr Wade. Just asking.

105
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,653
Mr Wade .. and smile.

106
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,399
The bride and groom to live
in the Morgan mansion?

107
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,280
They will look for a suitable apartment.

108
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:56,713
Please, Mr Wade, could I have a smile?

109
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,007
The readers of the Evening News want to
know who will handle the family finance.

110
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,068
That's an impertinent
question and I refuse.

111
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,078
The Philadelphia heiress who wed a young
artist had a joint checking account.

112
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,984
Listen, my inquisitive friend.
I'm not a struggling young artist.

113
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:10,413
I am the advertising manager
of a thriving corporation.

114
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,735
Please Mr Wade.

115
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:13,983
Could I have just .. a .. smile?

116
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,640
What corporation is thriving these days?
- Lincoln Farburn Sausages Incorporated.

117
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:20,298
Sausages?
- Oh boy, sausages?

118
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,351
What's the matter with sausages?
- Nothing.

119
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,863
Sausages are lovely, beautiful, tasty.

120
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:28,303
That's right. Think of sausages,
Mr Wade .. and smile.

121
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:29,809
Now get this.

122
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:33,530
Mr William Wade will not accept a
penny of, or derive any benefit from ..

123
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:37,144
Mrs William Wade's personal
fortune. Directly, or indirectly.

124
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:40,389
You can print that. There's your smile.
You know what you can do with that.

125
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:43,625
Okay, Mr Wade, we'll print it.

126
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:45,822
It's a swell story even
if you don't read it.

127
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:54,454
I wonder if by any chance I
could get a picture of you?

128
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,651
Sure. I photograph very well too.

129
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:03,237
Thank you very much, mister .. Morgan.

130
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,247
Good evening, Mr Wade.
A happy day for us all.

131
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:16,027
May I offer congratulations?
- Thank you, Joseph.

132
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,983
We'll have to be having a front
door key made for you now, sir.

133
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,724
Bill .. Bill.

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,789
Darling.

135
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,625
Hello angel. Sorry to be late.
- That's alright. You're here.

136
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:34,043
Come along dear.
Everyone is dying to meet you.

137
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,725
This is Bill Wade.

138
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:41,312
Cary Roskerville and Helen Hewitt.

139
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,860
I think you have met before?
- Not when I was sober.

140
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:46,055
Obviously, you don't drink
enough. I'm charmed.

141
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,889
What's all this about a wedding?
- People don't get married anymore.

142
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,776
These people do. Don't they, Bill?

143
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,603
I held out as long as I could but
she got me in a weak moment.

144
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:56,091
And was he hard to get?
It took me a year to land him.

145
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,812
Where did she find you, Wade?

146
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:04,322
I was born here in New York in the wilds
of 179th Street. Been here ever since.

147
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,178
You haven't begun to live yet.

148
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,673
You're not going to waste
your youth on these nitwits.

149
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:09,810
Come on.

150
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,103
Ladies and gentlemen.

151
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:17,892
Hey.
- It's alright.

152
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:19,067
Yes, but ..

153
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,162
So the gossip is true.
I <i>am </i>going to be married.

154
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:24,696
And this is it. Bill Wade.

155
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,657
It, them, these and those.

156
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:39,637
Well, that's the whole story.

157
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:43,934
I'm so happy I can't talk coherently.
The wedding will be in about a month.

158
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,378
Of course, we're going to
ask everybody we know.

159
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,121
How many will that be?

160
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:50,080
Well, Audrey Cotton had 1,200.

161
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:52,647
Madison Square Garden holds 17,000.

162
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:57,236
Better get him on your
yacht quickly, Carol.

163
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,056
And hide him in darkest Africa.

164
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,416
I don't trust myself.

165
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,155
I don't trust any of you.

166
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,204
We are sailing for Monte Carlo on
The Princess 2 hours after the ceremony.

167
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,821
Darling, I'm very sorry to
tell you I get very ill at sea.

168
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:13,631
When seasickness comes in at the
porthole, love flies out of the ..

169
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,034
Other porthole.

170
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,300
He sounds unromantic,
but that's just his natural modesty.

171
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,319
You ought to see him in a taxicab.

172
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:25,630
Come on Bill, let's get out of here,
before you confess your rheumatism.

173
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,693
Bill, what's the matter?

174
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,115
You've been saying the oddest things.

175
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:46,299
Carol, I can't go to
Monte Carlo on your yacht.

176
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,908
I've got a job to hold down.

177
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,770
Oh .. the sausage business.

178
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,518
It isn't the sausage business.

179
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,202
It's the advertizing business.

180
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,274
But you'll give up the
advertizing business.

181
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:56,890
I'll do nothing of the kind.

182
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,425
Why, darling? I have enough
money for both of us.

183
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,272
Carol, can I have a quarter? I want to
go out and get a package of cigarettes.

184
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:05,267
Don't be silly.
It won't be like that.

185
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:08,568
Besides, if you .. really love me ..
- Wait a minute.

186
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,114
I love you more than I thought
it was possible to love anybody.

187
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,493
I am drowned in a sea
of blissful anticipation.

188
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,752
Over the fact you're
about to become my wife.

189
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:18,213
I'm sorry, Bill.

190
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,459
I'm not going to even try and tell you.

191
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,549
Men never understand how
much women love them.

192
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,560
Then that's all settled, isn't it?

193
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,055
Bill.

194
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,551
You can take 3 months off to take me to
Monte Carlo for a honeymoon, can't you?

195
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,728
Carol, I can't afford to take 3 months
off and pay for a honeymoon in Europe.

196
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,182
Why can't I pay for it?

197
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:42,766
I'm marrying you. <i>Not</i> your bank account.
- Bill, you're being a quixotic fool.

198
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:45,299
Perhaps I am, but that's
the guy you have to marry.

199
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,028
Say, is this a private
fight or can anybody join?

200
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,411
No, no fight.

201
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:50,964
Come on, Carol. Let's dance.

202
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:53,291
I want to get as much
use out of you as possible.

203
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,395
While you're still freelancing.

204
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:57,335
Are we keeping you up?

205
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,276
No. I don't know why I'm so sleepy.

206
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:01,985
I didn't roll out of bed
till way past noon today.

207
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,588
You lead a hard life.

208
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:06,154
Bill, we'll have many dances
before the evening's over.

209
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,020
The orchestra is playing until 4am.

210
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,183
That's just the shank
of the evening, blessed.

211
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:11,152
Darling.

212
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,979
Goodnight, Phyllis.
- Goodnight.

213
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,250
Goodnight.

214
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,425
Happy dreams.

215
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:27,757
Never mind, Joseph.

216
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:29,845
Anything more, Miss Carol?
- Goodnight, Joseph.

217
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:31,170
Goodnight, Mr Wade.

218
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,322
Goodnight, Miss Carol.
- Goodnight, Joseph.

219
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,785
I ought to be in bed this minute.

220
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:42,740
But we're going to settle this now.

221
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,179
You've been absurd tonight, Bill.

222
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,197
Carol, you might just as well
make up your mind to one thing.

223
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,799
You are going to live on my income.
- Your income?

224
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,360
How much is that?
- Twenty thousand a year.

225
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:04,291
Wait a minute, I'm not apologizing.
I'm not asking you to share my poverty.

226
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:06,995
I'm mighty lucky to be making
that money in these times.

227
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,434
But that's less than 400 dollars a week.
- You're lucky too.

228
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:13,999
You're one girl in ten thousand who can
get a man who's making 400 a week.

229
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:16,496
Bill, why shouldn't we have
everything out of life we can?

230
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:18,694
I refuse to go through
life having people say:

231
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:22,010
There goes Bill Wade who married
Carol Morgan's millions. Millions.

232
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:25,534
But you have your own job. I'm very
willing to have you stay with sausages.

233
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:28,610
Don't say sausages.
- Sausages, sausages, sausages!

234
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,357
Your sentiments are noble, Bill.
But it's your pride speaking.

235
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:36,639
Who says it isn't?
- You think I have any pride?

236
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,306
Pride? What in?
- In the things I can do in my position.

237
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,849
Why should I close up this lovely house
and discharge a lot of good servants?

238
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,034
When it's unnecessary.
- I'll tell you: To be Mrs Bill Wade.

239
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:48,676
Is that final?
- Bill Wade on 20-thousand a year.

240
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:52,201
If you're going to make money so
important I'll make it important too.

241
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:56,507
If you make an issue of living on
your salary I shall make an issue ..

242
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:58,539
Of having the things
I can with <i>my</i> money.

243
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,930
Alright. Consider it settled then.
- That suits me.

244
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:03,054
Great. Maybe I'll get
some sleep for a change.

245
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:04,320
Maybe you will.

246
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:06,784
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

247
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,496
I couldn't leave you like this.

248
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,830
I was going to phone your apartment.

249
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:22,975
I'm sorry.
- Don't talk.

250
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,151
Hold me tight.

251
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:50,589
What time shall I pick you up
tomorrow to go to the license bureau?

252
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:51,628
Tomorrow?

253
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:52,989
Bill.

254
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,333
But I can get the wedding
ready in a month.

255
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,039
Carol, darling.

256
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,651
You are in no position
to dictate terms now.

257
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,166
Neither are you.

258
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:03,807
That's a funny way for you to talk.

259
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,448
You didn't by any chance
plan this deliberately?

260
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,393
How could it have been an accident?

261
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:13,851
Now darling, we'll get married without
any terms or conditions whatsoever.

262
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:17,613
We'll get married tomorrow.

263
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,959
And settle down to work out
normal life .. on my income.

264
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,118
Supposing I refuse?
- You can't refuse.

265
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,939
I can't refuse but you can?

266
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:28,789
If you weren't raised like a character
out of Arabian Nights you'd understand.

267
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,567
The viewpoint of a caveman
who moves his wife with a club.

268
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,771
I ought to act like a caveman and beat
some common-sense into your head.

269
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,831
Yes. That would be
your idea of matrimony.

270
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:39,804
To come home late and beat your
wife up because the soup was cold.

271
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,077
I would be so unimportant in this house
as Miss Carol Morgan's husband ..

272
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:46,226
That if I came home late,
the soup <i>would</i> be cold.

273
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,305
We don't have soup in
the house .. I hate soup.

274
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,973
Ye Gods. We can even
get into a row about soup.

275
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:55,010
Yes, the row is about soup, and beans
and brooms and laundry and cooks.

276
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,415
With my income I don't intend to mess
about in a small apartment and one maid.

277
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:01,711
With your money you make me feel like an
immigrant whose wife takes in washing.

278
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:03,653
Now you listen to me: my ultimatum.

279
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,980
<i>You're</i> giving ultimatums? That's good.
- Shut up.

280
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:08,839
This is one time we're not going
to stand here and argue all night.

281
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,288
Will you do as I wish?

282
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,528
First, I'll burn all the clothes and
jewelry I bought with my own money.

283
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:15,351
Shut up .. what's your answer?

284
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:17,216
Oh .. sausages.

285
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,177
Miss Morgan, in the circumstances.

286
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:24,693
You should feel very glad that
this is 1932 and not the prim '80s.

287
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,493
I don't see any shotguns around.

288
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:29,135
So I'll say goodnight.

289
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,700
When you come to
your senses, call me up.

290
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:33,767
I'll be waiting.

291
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:09,942
Yes.

292
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:15,070
Mr Carter is on the phone.
He wants to make an appointment.

293
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,232
Tell him I'll drop into the
bank on my way downtown.

294
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:20,817
And get Mr Wade on the phone at once.
- Yes, Miss Morgan.

295
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:29,616
These extraordinary times
require extraordinary measures.

296
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,223
You try to frighten me.

297
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,458
Carol, you're broke.
No mincing words about it.

298
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,771
But everything <i>can't</i> be gone.
- Borrowed on.

299
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:37,650
Up to the hilt. Beyond the hilt.

300
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,607
Sell everything. Pay off the loans.

301
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:42,950
You borrowed two millions on what
was twelve million dollars of security.

302
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,754
At present market prices.

303
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,643
When we clear this up you'll only
owe them half a million more.

304
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,295
That's only one instance.

305
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,744
What am I to do?
- First, the house must go.

306
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:53,907
Sell my house?

307
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,529
You're out of your mind.

308
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,638
You can't do this to me.
Money can't vanish.

309
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,268
Oh, you fools.

310
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,943
Why didn't you save me?
Why didn't you do something?

311
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,462
That's rich.
- Indecent.

312
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:09,720
But .. but what am I to do?

313
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:12,412
The world is not itself.
Great changes have taken place.

314
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:14,327
You must endure a great change yourself.

315
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:15,943
Go to work.
- I can't work.

316
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,965
I don't know how.

317
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:27,625
Thank you.

318
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:30,996
I beg your pardon but ..

319
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:32,946
Mr Wade's secretary sent me in.

320
00:20:33,157 --> 00:20:35,202
I'm Bill's brother. Anthony Wade.
- Oh?

321
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,017
Most people call me Tony.

322
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:38,953
I didn't mean that you would.

323
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:40,812
You are Carol Morgan, aren't you?

324
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,599
But I <i>would</i> call you Tony.

325
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,471
You don't look as if you
belong in an office.

326
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:47,410
You've got that wide-open-spaces look.

327
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,166
I've just hailed from Colorado.

328
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:51,703
Good heavens. What does one do there?
Take mud baths?

329
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,307
Don't laugh but I'm going
to be a metallurgist.

330
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,242
Laugh? Why, I was never
so impressed in my life.

331
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:00,240
What particular metal do you 'urge'?
- Radium.

332
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,929
Does it take a lot of urging
or does it succumb easily?

333
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:04,681
It fights you to the bitter end.

334
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,500
Tell me about it.
- I'd rather not.

335
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,169
You tell me about your urges.

336
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:13,095
Up to now, I've just managed to urge
the body from one place to another.

337
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,721
From what I hear, Bill's done
some pretty tall urging.

338
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:18,588
I hope it's been effective.

339
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:24,345
Because, Bill's a pretty regular guy.

340
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:30,013
So it's not only what he's done for me.

341
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,297
It's .. what he is.

342
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:34,102
I know what you mean.

343
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:36,283
I .. I'd commit murder for him.

344
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,788
Well, I'm going to
commit marriage for him.

345
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,853
Some people think that's just as bad.
- I'm glad.

346
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,508
Carol .. I'm sorry.

347
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:48,734
Things are certainly
getting tough these days.

348
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:51,041
You go to sleep when I propose to you.

349
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:53,634
And keep me waiting an hour
when I come to accept you.

350
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:55,038
Carol.

351
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:58,984
Carol, there's something we've to face.
- Bill, let me talk. Please.

352
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:03,375
This is probably the most
humiliating moment in my life.

353
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:05,506
Bill.

354
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:07,470
I'm broke.

355
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:09,466
I haven't got a penny.

356
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,897
But darling, I want you to
believe that's not why I'm here.

357
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:16,367
You see, that's pretty tough for you.

358
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,099
I know what it means to you.

359
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,535
Don't you care, Miss Morgan?
Bill would prefer it that way.

360
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:23,225
Wouldn't you, Bill?
- I'm not quite that selfish.

361
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:27,006
It's a funny world, Carol. But it seems
to give you a laugh at the right moment.

362
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:29,245
I can laugh too, Bill.

363
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,662
If you'll take me in your arms and
tell me that nothing else matters.

364
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:36,846
You are in my arms and
nothing else matters.

365
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:39,060
It was an awful sock on the jaw.

366
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,477
But I'm beginning to feel better.

367
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,413
Brace yourself for another sock.

368
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:47,397
The firm has failed.

369
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,043
It's going under today.

370
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:51,183
So, I'm out of a job.

371
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:54,273
Oh, Bill.

372
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,851
I guess the joke is on me alright.

373
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,315
Bill Wade and twenty thousand a year.

374
00:23:03,685 --> 00:23:05,639
You'll get another job
with all your brains.

375
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:06,768
Sure.

376
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,979
Sure, how about it, Mr Metallurgist?
Me good Filipino boy.

377
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,694
Shake 'em up cocktails,
press 'em up pants, shine 'em up shoes.

378
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:15,388
Keep 'em mouth shut.

379
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,997
I'm not going to pretend
that I'm happy, Carol.

380
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:24,389
I've been building myself up for ten
years and all I've got is in the firm.

381
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,655
They're certainly trying to keep us
from getting married, aren't they?

382
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:29,654
Maybe it will turn out alright.

383
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:32,331
Anyway, we can start out even.
- Yes, even.

384
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:34,650
You take pencils and
I'll take shoestrings.

385
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:37,895
You take one side of the
street and I'll take the other.

386
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:39,953
It will be pencils or shoestrings.

387
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:42,464
Things are pretty tough in
my line right now, but ..

388
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:45,156
I can get something, if it's
only 60 or 70 dollars a week.

389
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:48,042
60 or 70 dollars a week?

390
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,652
Plus marriage.

391
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:51,674
Plus living our lives together.

392
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,714
That's worth millions, Carol, Isn't it?

393
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:57,866
Or .. isn't it?

394
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:01,098
Bill, I love you.

395
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,219
I don't want to live without you.

396
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,366
But don't you see we ..

397
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:08,069
We couldn't just marry on nothing.
- Why not?

398
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,445
You'd look awfully cute
in a gingham apron.

399
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,991
Trying to decide or not
whether a potato was boiled.

400
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,644
You don't seem to realize I've
never had to think about money.

401
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,195
Then don't think about it.

402
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,193
<i>I'll</i> think about it.

403
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,099
Two dollars for a taxi.

404
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,801
Two dollars for a license.
Two dollars for a magistrate.

405
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:25,220
As if that were all.

406
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:28,625
Two dollars for a dress, two dollars for
a furnished room, two dollars for a ..?

407
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,358
Bill, please don't misunderstand.

408
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:33,095
I'll wait for you.

409
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:35,787
I don't see generosity in a woman ..

410
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:38,170
Who wants a man to make
a soft spot for her to lie in.

411
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:41,458
I don't see anything generous in a man
expecting a woman to share his poverty.

412
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,778
The kind of woman I want thinks more of
me than she does of dollars and cents.

413
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:48,016
Don't call me a<i> kind</i> of a woman.
- Can you come to City Hall this minute?

414
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:49,685
This minute? Why this minute?

415
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:52,581
Because I leave for Chicago tonight.
I think I have an opening there.

416
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,321
Do you want to go with me or not?
- Chicago tonight? Bill, I can't.

417
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:57,510
Give me just a week.
- Not a week, not an hour.

418
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:59,637
Yes or no, now.
- Bill, you're insane.

419
00:25:00,938 --> 00:25:01,613
I.

420
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:06,372
That's all the answer I need.

421
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:09,699
Wait for me, will you Tony.

422
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,032
I've got a couple of things to clean up.

423
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:16,290
You might sell the
Rolls Royce first, Carol.

424
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,411
I never did like that upholstery.

425
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:31,104
Why didn't you talk him out of that?
He was waiting for you to come through.

426
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:33,816
Goodbye, Mr Anthony Wade.
Who people call Tony.

427
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:37,135
But now is the time he needs you.
- Ever been to Palm Beach, Tony?

428
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,615
People who marry when
they're broke stay married.

429
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:42,657
It's late for Florida, but some
amusing people will still be there.

430
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:44,255
I'm glad Bill lost his job.

431
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,233
Smart people, Tony. Rich people
with great, lovely houses.

432
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:51,144
You're a useless good-for-nothing.
- A nice, soft bed to lie in, Tony.

433
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,435
Don't be so glum, kid.

434
00:25:58,091 --> 00:25:59,625
I'm the one that's lost his job.

435
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,522
Not you.

436
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,205
You're headed for ..?

437
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:06,158
What's the name of that place?
- Lake Joflore.

438
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:07,819
New river country. Yukon.

439
00:26:08,162 --> 00:26:08,888
Ah yes.

440
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,578
The spell of the Yukon.

441
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,321
Where men are men and
women are few and far between.

442
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,327
I've taken my fun where I've found it.
I'm sick of the taste of champagne.

443
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:19,658
Thank God, when I'm skinned to a finish.

444
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,527
I'll hike to the Yukon again.

445
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:24,462
Whenever you wisecrack so
much, I know you're unhappy.

446
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:26,562
What, Bill Wade unhappy?

447
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:29,833
Say, I'm glad I got my sock on
the jaw when I was still young.

448
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,180
It doesn't hurt so much.
- I mean that girl.

449
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:34,436
Girl?

450
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,009
What girl?
- Carol.

451
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:42,663
Shall we be a couple of strong, silent
he-men and not talk about that anymore?

452
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:44,197
She's no good, Bill.

453
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:46,335
She's just a cold, mercenary type.

454
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:48,474
Born to be a .. courtesan.

455
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:50,787
She'll end up on the streets.
- Stop it.

456
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:55,736
Stop it or your big brother will have
to wash out your mouth with soap.

457
00:26:56,302 --> 00:26:57,897
Can't you see she's all glitter?

458
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:00,167
And inside, no real character.

459
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,235
She's alright, Tony.

460
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,572
She just doesn't know it yet.

461
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:06,733
Maybe this will be a lesson to her.

462
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,979
"<i>Midland Express now ready on track 4</i>."

463
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,413
That's me.

464
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,674
You pay for the coffee, will you.

465
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,784
Your train doesn't leave until nine.

466
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:20,830
Don't bother to come along. We've had
enough 'hail and farewell' stuff today.

467
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,589
You'll take care of yourself, Bill?

468
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,329
Sure .. bye-bye and good luck.

469
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,899
If you want to get in touch drop me
a line at the club. They'll find me.

470
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,062
Goodbye, Bill.

471
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:30,990
Cut out that sob stuff.

472
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,395
Your big brother will have
to sock you on the jaw.

473
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,264
Bye.
- So long.

474
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,769
Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.

475
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,329
All down.

476
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,024
Number 8. Black and even.

477
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:40,202
What's the matter, Miss Morgan?
Aren't you betting?

478
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,905
I can't make up my mind.

479
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,269
13 hasn't won once tonight.

480
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:47,103
Shoot the one on 13.
It's bound to drop this time.

481
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:52,038
How do you know?

482
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,116
It's my house and it's my wheel.

483
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:55,746
Listen, buddy.

484
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:58,460
Drop that pill into pocket 13 or
you don't work here no more.

485
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,364
Go on then.

486
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:05,829
Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.

487
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:10,537
All down.

488
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,588
One red. Five.

489
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:27,280
Tough luck.

490
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:29,941
What's a couple of
centuries to Carol Morgan?

491
00:30:37,598 --> 00:30:39,115
You keep on playing 13.

492
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,102
Everything in the world comes to you.

493
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:44,062
If you wait long enough.

494
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,971
Not always, Mr Blainey.

495
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,459
Bill, where are you?

496
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,873
I never knew how lucky I was when
you wanted me to marry you.

497
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:53,517
Lucky? Yes.

498
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:03,031
Yes, Mrs Blainey?
- Miss Morgan, I am surprised.

499
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,309
I'm shocked.

500
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:06,825
You have borrowed money
from my friends. I resent ..

501
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:08,702
I'll pay them all back.
- Indeed.

502
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:10,316
And how, may I ask?

503
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:12,277
Well, I'm ..

504
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,429
Expecting a check from a friend of
mine in New York at any moment now.

505
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,860
That's funny.

506
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:21,749
I gave you $1,500 for the privilege to
say that Carol Morgan is my house guest.

507
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:23,358
You cheated me.

508
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,511
Your name isn't worth anything anymore.

509
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,881
You are just a social panhandler.

510
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:29,971
Do you think I'd come here for $1,500?

511
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:32,920
For $15,000 if I had
any other place to go?

512
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:36,802
I've lived on, sponged on, and borrowed
from friends until they hate me.

513
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:40,862
That, Mrs Blainey, is why you've the
privilege of having me as your guest.

514
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:45,448
I've talked this over with my husband.
Now, you get out of here tomorrow.

515
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:48,402
I'll get out of here tonight.
- That's even better.

516
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,360
Hey, hey. What's the idea?

517
00:33:10,043 --> 00:33:10,672
Huh?

518
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,131
There's nothing like a
walk to make you sleepy.

519
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:15,377
A glass of fizz has the
same effect on me.

520
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:17,155
Will you have some?

521
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,333
No thank you.

522
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:20,319
Bad for the figure.

523
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,486
Hey, you must be going for a long walk.
You've got your nightgown with you.

524
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:26,678
Oh, my jewel case. It never leaves me.

525
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:29,343
You can't trust the service
at those cheap shops.

526
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:30,862
Shush.

527
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,864
Suppose someone is listening.

528
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:35,336
Sit down. I want to talk with you.

529
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,610
Mr Blainey, the hour is late.

530
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,870
And the situation compromising.
- Did my wife ask you to leave?

531
00:33:42,391 --> 00:33:44,256
No. She begged me to stay.

532
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:47,983
So you're running away tonight.
- Walking away, Mr Blainey.

533
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:49,982
You haven't a dime in the world?

534
00:33:52,995 --> 00:33:54,353
Not even railway fare.

535
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,356
Girl, I admire you. You've got guts.

536
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:02,046
Mr Blainey.
A gentleman would say 'intestines'.

537
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:05,484
Go on .. sit down and stop acting.

538
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:06,903
Sit down.

539
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,187
Here you are.

540
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,222
Well?

541
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:14,386
You know .. I'm no gentleman.

542
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:17,003
I'll keep your secret.

543
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,609
But I want to be one.

544
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,297
You can show me the way.

545
00:34:21,371 --> 00:34:23,874
I believe there is a book published:
'How to be a gentleman'.

546
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,124
Paper, fifty cents.
Leather, two dollars.

547
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:30,188
Stop it. I'm crazy about you
and want to give you the job.

548
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:35,301
The hours are too long, Mr Blainey.

549
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:39,428
I don't pretend to be in love with
my wife. But she<i> is</i> my wife.

550
00:34:40,218 --> 00:34:42,075
I've given her the
best years of my life.

551
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,666
As long as she behaves
herself I'll take care of her.

552
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:51,001
The first thing a gentleman learns is to
avoid mentioning his domestic affairs.

553
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:52,760
Sit down, sit down.

554
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:56,187
I know you're up against it.

555
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,373
But you're a swell. A real lady.

556
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,095
If not for this depression I'd have no
chance with a high-class dame like you.

557
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:05,393
It's an ill wind.

558
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,472
But the depression is over, Mr Blainey.
- Huh?

559
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,153
The panic's now on.

560
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,742
So I don't believe I
care to buy your violets.

561
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,399
I'm a born gambler, Miss Morgan.

562
00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:19,287
You keep playing the 13, Mr Blainey.
- I want to help you.

563
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:21,842
Here's 1,000 dollars.
- Mr Blainey, I can't take it.

564
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,298
It's alright now. There is
no strings attached to it.

565
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:26,248
You'll pay me back when you can.

566
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,521
Goodbye.

567
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:34,175
Don't buy that book, Mr Blainey.

568
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:37,113
You are a gent .. if ever I've seen one.

569
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:41,739
You know .. my wife wasn't sore at you.

570
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:44,523
She was only jealous of
the high class competition.

571
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:46,665
Reassure her, Mr Blainey.

572
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,196
Reassure her.

573
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,805
Now that's what I call class.

574
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,855
How is my baby?

575
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,785
I've got a wretched headache.

576
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,929
Must I pretend?
- Or else.

577
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,721
What do you want to
do after dinner, baby?

578
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:45,698
Let's get drunk.
- Okay by me.

579
00:36:59,048 --> 00:36:59,843
Bubbles.

580
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,894
That's the girl. That's the girl.

581
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:16,243
Send her away. Send her away.

582
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,769
I won't need you anymore
tonight, Amanda.

583
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:27,512
And smile, baby .. smile baby.

584
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,016
Yes, smile baby.

585
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:39,449
Play something for me.

586
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,943
What will you have?
Beethoven, Grieg, Chopin?

587
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,230
Hey.

588
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:58,520
I've got good news for you.

589
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:00,354
You are going away?

590
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:02,101
And you too.

591
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,630
We're alone for six weeks.

592
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,592
Oh.

593
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:11,449
You sold your family on
Honolulu at last, did you?

594
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,558
Yes, sir.

595
00:38:16,553 --> 00:38:19,756
My wife is a fine woman.
But she cramps my style.

596
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:22,292
Wake up.

597
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:24,612
You know what this means?

598
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:26,770
We're going to Monte Carlo.

599
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:29,316
Monte Carlo.

600
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:33,250
Monte Carlo.

601
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,299
It will be like a honeymoon, baby.

602
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,278
Monte Carlo.

603
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:41,918
Honeymoon.

604
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,757
Hurray! Champagne, Blainey.

605
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,415
I always promised myself Monte Carlo.

606
00:38:51,711 --> 00:38:54,036
What is it like, baby?
- Monte Carlo?

607
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:57,135
You doze in the sun, you
swim in the moonlight.

608
00:38:58,191 --> 00:38:59,467
The Mediterranean.

609
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,784
You didn't know much about the
Mediterranean did you, Blainey?

610
00:39:02,995 --> 00:39:03,818
It's blue.

611
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,471
It's so blue you want to dive
into it and never come up.

612
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:11,095
That's what I want to do, Blainey.

613
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,888
Come here. Come here.
Now, don't run away.

614
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,474
You never saw me dive, did you Blainey.

615
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:26,958
You old devil, I like you this way.

616
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:30,538
You'll like me when you
see me dive, Blainey.

617
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,974
Look. Look .. I'll wear a
new bathing costume. White.

618
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:38,516
I'll stand high upon a rock
like this and I'll dive ..

619
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:46,975
It's true, Blainey.

620
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,937
I'm going to dive in and never come up.

621
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:11,896
There is a gentleman here, Miss Morgan.

622
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:14,898
I told him you weren't in,
but he insisted on seeing you.

623
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:17,346
His name is Mr Wade.

624
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,186
Bill.
- Carol.

625
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,398
They told me you weren't
in but I knew better.

626
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,213
After all .. Bill Wade is Bill Wade.

627
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,017
Bill Wade.

628
00:40:39,983 --> 00:40:41,549
You're looking as lovely as ever.

629
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:43,919
And you the same, Bill.

630
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:45,704
Older my girl, and sadder.

631
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:47,542
And wiser.

632
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,996
How did you find me?

633
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,619
I saw you on the boulevard and
took the number of your car.

634
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:56,812
You're you .. yourself.

635
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,026
Me myself.

636
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,297
Bill.

637
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:01,117
Where have you been?

638
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:03,163
Looking for you.

639
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:08,370
Remember the house?
- And old Joseph?

640
00:41:09,105 --> 00:41:10,380
How he always waited up.

641
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:12,750
How we always used to send him to bed.

642
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,744
Suppose you let me in on the joke.

643
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:23,129
Mr Wade - Mr Blainey.
- How do you do?

644
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,437
Champagne, Bill?
- Thanks.

645
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,850
You know, when you came in
we were drinking to the future.

646
00:41:30,508 --> 00:41:31,972
Her future and mine.

647
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:35,091
Here you are, Bill.
See how it bubbles?

648
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:37,550
Millions and millions of bubbles.

649
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:41,366
I've had too much to drink, Bill.

650
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:43,451
Drinking it was easy.

651
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:46,486
Get some more champagne
will you, Blainey?

652
00:41:46,785 --> 00:41:48,187
No. Later.

653
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:51,641
Mr Blainey, I don't know who you are.

654
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:54,017
But this lady happens to be a lady.

655
00:41:54,391 --> 00:41:56,619
If you know what I mean, which I doubt.
- Bill, I ..

656
00:41:56,837 --> 00:41:58,370
Alright, Mr smart-guy.

657
00:41:58,843 --> 00:42:01,159
And this apartment happens
to be <i>my</i> apartment.

658
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:02,769
If you know what I mean.

659
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:05,065
And I think you do.

660
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:09,817
I see.

661
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:13,995
I'm sorry .. I didn't understand.

662
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:17,736
Bill .. Bill!

663
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:19,435
Bill.

664
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:21,976
Let me go. Let me go!

665
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:28,704
You hurt me.
- Nobody could hurt you.

666
00:42:35,665 --> 00:42:36,466
Get up.

667
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,742
What's the matter with you?

668
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:08,666
You ain't walking out on me.

669
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:14,997
Don't I treat you right?

670
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:20,286
What with all the swell
clothes and jewelry.

671
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:32,235
I'm going to take you to Europe.
To Monte Carlo.

672
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,351
I don't even get sore
when you act snooty.

673
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:50,404
Where are you going to find
anybody as generous as me?

674
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:56,688
Now, wait a minute.

675
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:01,260
Don't kid yourself.
You can't square this with that boy.

676
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:03,550
You're right, Blainey.

677
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,625
I know I can't.

678
00:44:07,992 --> 00:44:09,300
But if I try hard enough.

679
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:12,338
Maybe I can square it with myself.

680
00:44:14,324 --> 00:44:16,213
You had better come
back and get your key.

681
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,212
But my dear Miss Morgan.

682
00:44:22,652 --> 00:44:25,091
We haven't enough business to
keep these young women going.

683
00:44:25,591 --> 00:44:28,220
We don't need employees.
We need customers.

684
00:44:32,093 --> 00:44:33,555
Can't you read English?

685
00:44:34,766 --> 00:44:36,171
The sign says 'experienced'.

686
00:44:36,386 --> 00:44:37,268
Sure.

687
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:40,690
Write your name on a piece of
paper and take it home with you.

688
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,653
What would I do with you? Look at you?

689
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:46,605
Scram.

690
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,019
Sorry, folks.

691
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:22,949
That's all there is today.

692
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,890
Try again tomorrow.

693
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:33,628
Oh God.

694
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:37,918
Give us this day our daily bread.

695
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,047
So, it's pay or get out. See?

696
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,598
My husband is sick and
we've got to rent this room.

697
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,057
I'll pay you when I ..
- How?

698
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:51,965
Somehow.

699
00:45:53,171 --> 00:45:55,914
I've listened to you jabber
about jobs for the last time.

700
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,373
I won't tell you again.

701
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:00,073
Oh? Fresh, ain't you?

702
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,473
Well, 'Fresh'. You can get out tonight.

703
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,382
Alright.

704
00:46:06,023 --> 00:46:08,235
Nothing matters when you
haven't eaten for two days.

705
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,295
Ain't you got any folks?

706
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:12,277
No.

707
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:14,767
I know a lady ..

708
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:18,211
Fifty-fifty?

709
00:46:19,311 --> 00:46:20,521
Thank you. No.

710
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:23,004
You wouldn't have to ask me twice.

711
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:26,681
Say .. you've got pretty feet.

712
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,184
It's mostly the shoes that
make pretty feet, I always say.

713
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:46,507
Say.

714
00:46:47,466 --> 00:46:50,495
I'll give you the room for another
week if you'll give me the shoes.

715
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:56,517
Throw in a dollar, cash?
- Cash? You're crazy.

716
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:59,661
Well .. they cost 55 dollars.

717
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:00,971
No?

718
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:16,016
Here.

719
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:19,544
If you tell my husband
I'll skin you alive.

720
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:03,510
Bill.

721
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:10,634
Go ahead.

722
00:48:11,545 --> 00:48:12,594
Go ahead and cry.

723
00:48:13,997 --> 00:48:15,046
Nobody will care.

724
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:19,907
I'm here .. it's Bill.

725
00:48:23,352 --> 00:48:24,460
Funny, isn't it.

726
00:48:26,893 --> 00:48:27,688
Bill.

727
00:48:28,397 --> 00:48:29,511
Don't let go of me.

728
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:32,208
Don't ever let go of me.

729
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:34,895
Ever.

730
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:37,385
My soup is getting cold.

731
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,633
I ..

732
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:58,850
Haven't had anything
to eat for two days.

733
00:48:59,782 --> 00:49:01,898
The smell of food made
me feel a little bit sick.

734
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,760
Here you are.

735
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:09,009
Blow on it now, it's kinda hot.

736
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:21,676
Well, Bill Wade.

737
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:23,515
How have you been?

738
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:26,198
I'm still the luckiest guy in the world.

739
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:27,519
I got a job.

740
00:49:28,324 --> 00:49:28,936
Oh?

741
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:31,509
Oh. What do you do?

742
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:34,505
It doesn't matter. Does it?

743
00:49:36,486 --> 00:49:38,537
How would you like to
be a truck driver's wife?

744
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:44,759
Don't you remember?

745
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:46,456
That apartment?

746
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:48,124
What apartment?

747
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:50,990
It's funny. I don't seem to remember.

748
00:49:51,846 --> 00:49:53,025
You must be dreaming.

749
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:56,732
Will you marry me, Carol?

750
00:49:59,452 --> 00:50:00,178
Bill.

751
00:50:01,814 --> 00:50:02,936
Are you sure?

752
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:05,870
Have you really forgotten that ..?

753
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:07,825
That man?

754
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:10,078
From this moment on, we start fresh.

755
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:13,121
What's behind us is behind us forever.

756
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:16,560
From now on, let me catch you ..

757
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:19,321
No.

758
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:21,360
Don't let me.

759
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:25,230
I think I'd kill you.

760
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:28,854
I think I'd want you to.

761
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:31,697
You see Bill, I ..

762
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:33,403
I have changed.

763
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:36,619
I haven't got much money.

764
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:41,429
Tomorrow is payday at the
National Trucking Corporation.

765
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:44,431
Wait a minute, Mr Truck Driver.

766
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:48,061
Let me see.

767
00:50:49,194 --> 00:50:50,488
Five .. ten.

768
00:50:51,183 --> 00:50:52,063
Twenty.

769
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:54,042
Twenty-five.

770
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:55,844
Thirty.

771
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,448
Forty, fifty.

772
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:00,647
Sixty.

773
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:11,031
You've got a man in there.
- Aha, the house detective.

774
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:14,951
I don't care what my tenants do outside.
But this is a respectable house.

775
00:51:15,162 --> 00:51:17,578
An eminently respectable house, my lady.
- We're married.

776
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,312
Don't give me any of that guff.

777
00:51:20,027 --> 00:51:22,724
Look. At midnight, across the line.
- The papers, lady. The papers.

778
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:25,474
We hitch-hiked our way in a Ford.
- Came back in a milk truck.

779
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:27,507
It wasn't milk, but whiskey
in white bottles.

780
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,191
The most charming milkman,
I beg your pardon, whiskey-man.

781
00:51:30,439 --> 00:51:32,333
Presented the bride
and groom with a pint.

782
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:35,707
Lady, do you suffer from falling
hairs or disappointed affections?

783
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:36,606
Bill.

784
00:51:36,983 --> 00:51:38,548
I wonder if this cures anything.

785
00:51:38,759 --> 00:51:41,047
I hope he takes better care of
you than you can of yourself.

786
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:42,630
Darling, she congratulates us.

787
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:45,638
Dear lady, your good wishes bring a
tear to my eye and a lump to my throat.

788
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:49,497
Let me see, two glasses. The ladies get
the glasses. I get the tooth-mug. Great.

789
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:51,301
A tooth-mug gives added flavor.

790
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:54,500
I'd rather you paid your next week's
rent instead of a wedding ring of gold.

791
00:51:56,236 --> 00:51:57,617
It cost a quarter.

792
00:51:57,952 --> 00:52:00,529
Modern drugstores give service.
When I say service, I mean service.

793
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,468
They even wanted to sell us a go-kart.

794
00:52:02,712 --> 00:52:04,271
What's he doing living here with you?

795
00:52:04,482 --> 00:52:06,533
They wouldn't let me in
where he'd been living.

796
00:52:06,954 --> 00:52:08,199
Aha. And why?

797
00:52:08,512 --> 00:52:11,120
You see, I have been sharing an
apartment with three other millionaires.

798
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:13,708
Down at the YMCA.
Drink your soup. It's getting cold.

799
00:52:14,086 --> 00:52:14,715
Yep.

800
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,137
Down the rat-hole.
- Shakespeare.

801
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,101
Maybe I'll be getting
my rent regular now.

802
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:27,677
Lady, I lost my job two hours ago.
- That's why we got married.

803
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:29,853
You're a pair of lunatics.
- Certainly we are.

804
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,736
Only I'm crazier than he.
- Yep.

805
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,034
The room will be two
dollars a week more. Double.

806
00:52:35,482 --> 00:52:37,496
We owe you five dollars
then instead of three.

807
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:40,755
That's okay with me. A good husband
is worth two dollars a week anytime.

808
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:53,693
Madam, if you will invest ten or fifteen
million dollars in these oil wells.

809
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:56,994
In 28 or 42 years.
You will have a fortune.

810
00:53:58,418 --> 00:54:02,275
I don't want oil wells, special lotions,
steel bridges or corn cures. Go away.

811
00:54:03,045 --> 00:54:06,140
Madam, I don't come here to take
your money. I come here to do you good.

812
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,099
I am a bearer of glad tidings.

813
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:11,779
Bill.

814
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:13,338
You've got a job?

815
00:54:13,636 --> 00:54:14,542
No.
- No?

816
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:16,211
No. But I got a bottle of cream.

817
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:18,770
Bill.

818
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:20,811
You pawned the diamond necklace.

819
00:54:21,419 --> 00:54:22,465
No. No, ma'am.

820
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:24,638
No ma'am. I stole it.

821
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:25,861
Ah.

822
00:54:28,514 --> 00:54:30,222
Why didn't you steal some sugar too?

823
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,364
Give me a chance to get
my hand in, will you?

824
00:54:32,575 --> 00:54:35,525
Is it very difficult to steal cream?
- No, no. It's a cinch.

825
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:38,487
The family leave town and
forget to notify the milkman.

826
00:54:38,698 --> 00:54:40,551
Leave cream forlorn and abandoned.

827
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:43,668
Sneak up behind cream
when cream isn't looking.

828
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:47,191
Put cream in pocket and carry
cream to nice, warm home.

829
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:50,610
But no job, Bill?

830
00:54:51,076 --> 00:54:52,171
No. No job.

831
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:55,692
Plenty of promises, but no job.
- Who cares, says we.

832
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,124
Says 'we'?
What a very vulgar expression.

833
00:54:58,576 --> 00:55:00,758
'Says us'.
- Who cares, says 'us'.

834
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:03,615
Hmm .. we've had jobs before.

835
00:55:04,202 --> 00:55:06,294
Two in Chicago and three in New York.

836
00:55:06,505 --> 00:55:08,113
It's no novelty to us, getting jobs.

837
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:09,890
No novelty getting fired, either.

838
00:55:10,136 --> 00:55:12,404
And who cares, says was .. 'we'.

839
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,034
Other than the landlady.

840
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,577
Say, has Mrs Santa Claus been up here
bothering you about that rent again?

841
00:55:18,788 --> 00:55:21,143
No, 'not half', as we Britishers say.
Not half.

842
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:23,063
[ Door knocks ]

843
00:55:36,396 --> 00:55:39,706
Mrs Mandel, don't tell me the old income
tax man has been bothering you again.

844
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,088
No, but I brought this up.
It looked important.

845
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:56,220
Bill. A job .. a job.

846
00:55:56,901 --> 00:56:00,624
Bill's got a job, Bill's got a job.
Bill's got a job, Bill's got a job.

847
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:02,972
Bill's got a job, Bill's got a job.

848
00:56:09,645 --> 00:56:10,395
So.

849
00:56:12,671 --> 00:56:13,688
Listen, you two.

850
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:15,717
If you want to cook in this room.

851
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:18,178
You ought to have sense
enough to open up a window.

852
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:23,166
Mrs Mandel.
- Yes?

853
00:56:23,578 --> 00:56:26,715
If you're not careful, somebody is going
to creep up and slip you some rent.

854
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:27,720
Yes?

855
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:31,710
Maybe the work at the warehouse will
for once slow the slick tongue of yours.

856
00:56:32,328 --> 00:56:34,830
I would have preferred something
in literary or banking circles.

857
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,557
After all, there is a certain dignity
in the warehousing profession.

858
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:39,560
Banking ain't so good these days either.

859
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:49,849
Hey, where are you going?

860
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:52,211
I have to go and sneak
up on some more cream.

861
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:54,106
Bill, you've got a job.

862
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:06,674
Hey, buddy.

863
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:10,593
You mustn't go there. You were going
in the wrong place. Weren't you?

864
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,234
No, I was just going in to
see a dog about a man.

865
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:15,455
Before you buy a dog,
will you talk to us?

866
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,002
You want to take on driving a truck?
- Yep.

867
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,530
Look brother, we used
to drive for Maritime.

868
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:28,267
On account of so many men looking for
work they cut our pay fifty percent.

869
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:30,133
We're having a little trouble.

870
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,941
Far be it for Bill Wade to take
any man's job away from him.

871
00:57:33,505 --> 00:57:35,903
But I'm desperate.
- Yeah, and we're desperate too.

872
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:41,017
Now here's our position, you work all
hours, night and day. Rain and snow.

873
00:57:41,394 --> 00:57:43,596
And at the end of the week,
you haven't got a living wage.

874
00:57:43,816 --> 00:57:46,243
I haven't got any wage.
Anything is better than nothing.

875
00:57:46,454 --> 00:57:47,536
Now look, brother.

876
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,626
If we can keep them from driving
the trucks for a few more days.

877
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:54,178
We can get a break.
- I don't want to pull this sob stuff.

878
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:56,984
But it's down to a question of
keeping a roof over your head.

879
00:57:57,201 --> 00:57:58,767
And getting milk for your babies.

880
00:57:59,014 --> 00:58:01,311
Yeah, it's tough.
But look at my position.

881
00:58:01,693 --> 00:58:04,427
I've been married 4 months and gave
my wife my last 50 cents this morning.

882
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:07,848
Fellah, you'd better listen to reason,
or else something will happen.

883
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,386
Under the circumstances.

884
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:12,360
Some of us family men might
get a little bad-tempered.

885
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:15,228
Yeah, I get what you mean
and I don't blame you.

886
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:17,490
If anything happens,
I'm not the one to squeal.

887
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,534
But I'm going to go home tonight
with money in my pocket.

888
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:21,691
Okay, fellah.

889
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:23,794
I hope nothing happens to you.

890
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:25,100
Hop to it.

891
00:58:25,928 --> 00:58:27,279
Sorry it had to be you.

892
00:58:29,188 --> 00:58:31,079
I suppose I'll be seeing you soon.

893
00:58:43,494 --> 00:58:45,767
So you're going through with it, buddy?
- Yep.

894
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:47,957
Still want to lead with your chin?

895
00:58:48,715 --> 00:58:49,427
Yep.

896
00:59:22,723 --> 00:59:23,352
Hey.

897
00:59:25,848 --> 00:59:28,337
Hey, are you alright?
- I guess he's hurt.

898
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:31,869
Are you alright, buddy?

899
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:36,739
I guess they meant it.

900
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,347
You better come over here and sit down.
- I'm alright.

901
01:00:08,899 --> 01:00:10,179
Bill. What's the matter?

902
01:00:11,314 --> 01:00:12,349
What's happened?

903
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:13,977
The most amazing thing.

904
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:16,099
Surprise of the century.

905
01:00:17,015 --> 01:00:19,751
Bill Wade brings home
five dollars .. cash money.

906
01:00:20,176 --> 01:00:22,587
Bill darling, you're hurt.
What is it? What happened?

907
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:25,149
A fellah gave Bill a truck.
Truck didn't like Bill.

908
01:00:25,795 --> 01:00:27,343
So truck ran away with Bill.

909
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:31,480
Finished up today's work and
bring home five dollars cash.

910
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:34,321
Darling, don't talk.
Come and lie down. I'll get a doctor.

911
01:00:34,532 --> 01:00:36,486
No, no. You ought to
be ashamed of yourself.

912
01:00:36,772 --> 01:00:38,107
Doctors cost money.

913
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:40,383
I'm alright .. look.

914
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:43,732
I'm all ready to go out dancing.
- Oh, Bill.

915
01:00:44,216 --> 01:00:44,985
Bill.

916
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:46,807
Bill, you are hurt.

917
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,884
Tell me about it, darling.
What happened?

918
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,554
Bill, please talk to me.

919
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:52,212
Bill, open your eyes.

920
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:54,376
Darling, look at me.

921
01:00:59,071 --> 01:00:59,987
Mrs Mandel.

922
01:01:01,254 --> 01:01:02,378
Mrs Mandel.

923
01:01:03,629 --> 01:01:04,782
Mrs Mandel!

924
01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:29,702
Look here.

925
01:01:30,661 --> 01:01:32,260
Could you give me something to do?

926
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:33,902
I need work badly.

927
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,117
Listen. My husband is ill.

928
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,859
My life is in crisis.

929
01:01:41,703 --> 01:01:43,401
I've got a girl over there tonight.

930
01:01:43,779 --> 01:01:45,528
She's got four kids, all under six.

931
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:51,143
Listen.

932
01:01:52,155 --> 01:01:53,239
I'll do anything.

933
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:55,400
I must have money.

934
01:01:56,738 --> 01:01:58,104
I can't let him die.

935
01:02:00,108 --> 01:02:02,593
I'll scrub floors .. wash dishes.

936
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,557
Anything.

937
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:07,425
Yeah? It's tough, girly. I know.

938
01:02:09,594 --> 01:02:11,386
Want a bowl of soup, or a cup of coffee?

939
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:13,083
Do you think I could eat?

940
01:02:21,641 --> 01:02:24,726
The doctor didn't say whether I was to
use the money to get the things, did he?

941
01:02:25,353 --> 01:02:28,848
Well, with half of the rooms empty
and nobody paying their board.

942
01:02:29,398 --> 01:02:31,228
I can't do a thing no more.

943
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:33,388
You've been splendid.

944
01:02:46,682 --> 01:02:48,151
You aren't going to die, Bill.

945
01:02:49,368 --> 01:02:50,615
I won't let you die.

946
01:02:53,198 --> 01:02:54,855
There isn't anything I won't do.

947
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:56,430
Anything.

948
01:03:15,506 --> 01:03:16,652
Where are you going?

949
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:19,080
To the drugstore.

950
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,437
You look a little .. pale.

951
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:43,322
You've been an angel, Mrs Mandel.

952
01:03:44,368 --> 01:03:45,676
And you'll get your rent.

953
01:03:46,452 --> 01:03:48,018
And every penny you've loaned me.

954
01:03:48,348 --> 01:03:50,075
You forgot your lipstick.

955
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:51,476
Didn't you?

956
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:17,623
I'll take care of him while you're gone.

957
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:20,449
Good luck.

958
01:05:18,605 --> 01:05:19,784
It's funny, ain't it.

959
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:23,743
All the real things us
women do for our men.

960
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:27,590
We can't ever tell them about it.

961
01:05:48,865 --> 01:05:49,559
Carol.

962
01:05:52,587 --> 01:05:53,440
Carol.

963
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,983
Yes Bill, what is it?

964
01:05:57,546 --> 01:05:59,255
Carol, come here.

965
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,393
Come down here.

966
01:06:24,985 --> 01:06:25,937
Don't go away.

967
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:28,517
I .. I won't.

968
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:36,556
Why don't you kiss me?

969
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:49,960
Do you love me?

970
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:52,689
Of course.

971
01:06:57,571 --> 01:06:58,595
Let me see.

972
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:04,513
Bill.

973
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:06,574
Have I changed?

974
01:07:08,061 --> 01:07:09,565
Do I look .. different?

975
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:13,586
You're beautiful.

976
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,655
Oh, my darling.

977
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,451
My heart.

978
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:20,939
I had a heart once.

979
01:07:23,069 --> 01:07:24,506
I guess you must have it now.

980
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,338
Somehow or other.

981
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:30,123
It seems to have stopped beating.

982
01:07:30,365 --> 01:07:31,576
Mine is beating, Bill.

983
01:07:32,121 --> 01:07:33,947
Feel it beating .. feel.

984
01:07:35,814 --> 01:07:36,834
Beating so fast.

985
01:07:37,626 --> 01:07:39,548
I'm trying to give you
some of my strength.

986
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:41,243
So that you can get well.

987
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,426
Bill.

988
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:01,932
Hello, mister.

989
01:08:08,347 --> 01:08:11,320
I always send you'd
end in the gutter .. you.

990
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,966
Listen Tony, wait a minute.
You don't understand.

991
01:08:14,313 --> 01:08:16,447
It's because of ..
- Get away from me you tramp.

992
01:08:17,113 --> 01:08:20,245
Tony, please. Please. You don't know.
- I don't want to know.

993
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:24,064
Oh.

994
01:08:41,058 --> 01:08:43,205
Come on with me, sister.
- No.

995
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,288
Where are you taking me?
- To jail.

996
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:49,788
What will they do to me?
- Six months.

997
01:08:51,015 --> 01:08:51,773
Oh well.

998
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,718
They used to send girls of your
age to the Morgan Home for Girls.

999
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,663
But that's closed now. Ha.

1000
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,937
On account of the depression.

1001
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:03,081
Intoxication makes it three months more.
- Listen, officer.

1002
01:09:03,622 --> 01:09:06,339
I used to give money to that home.
- You? Come on.

1003
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,595
No, wait. Really, I can
tell you all about it.

1004
01:09:09,098 --> 01:09:11,963
29 percent of those girls went on the
streets because they had a good reason.

1005
01:09:12,174 --> 01:09:13,223
What good reason?

1006
01:09:13,618 --> 01:09:16,944
So, that's why they had the home.
Instead of sending them to prison.

1007
01:09:17,606 --> 01:09:20,414
I've got to do this .. I've got
the best reason in the world.

1008
01:09:21,426 --> 01:09:23,199
If you lock me up my husband will die.

1009
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,324
You've got a husband?
- He's sick. I can't get work.

1010
01:09:26,764 --> 01:09:28,266
I've got to have money for him.

1011
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,264
Now, supposing I let you go.

1012
01:09:32,975 --> 01:09:34,767
Will you promise never to do this again?

1013
01:09:35,776 --> 01:09:38,600
Yes, of course I'll promise.
- And when my back is turned, you ..

1014
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:41,619
What can we do when we're up against ..?
- You have to come along with me.

1015
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,194
Can't you see I'd give my heart
and soul to keep that promise?

1016
01:09:44,405 --> 01:09:45,422
You may as well.

1017
01:09:45,677 --> 01:09:48,439
You ain't going to be any good to
your husband for six months anyway.

1018
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:50,830
Alright then, I promise.
And I'll keep my word.

1019
01:09:51,237 --> 01:09:52,138
Wait a minute.

1020
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,142
Kiss the cross.

1021
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,711
Before God, I promise I'll never ..

1022
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,139
Never.
- Positive?

1023
01:10:12,895 --> 01:10:15,199
I promise I'll never .. do it again.

1024
01:10:19,558 --> 01:10:22,070
Say, are you a Catholic?
- No, a Presbyterian.

1025
01:10:24,337 --> 01:10:27,127
I guess if even a heathen
kisses the cross it's alright.

1026
01:10:28,026 --> 01:10:30,208
You're coming with me.
- But you said you'd let me go.

1027
01:10:30,419 --> 01:10:32,330
Come on.
- I promised you, didn't I?

1028
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,562
Come on.
- Won't you let me go? Please.

1029
01:10:37,549 --> 01:10:41,665
Are you familiar with City
Ordinance number 68,437?

1030
01:10:42,293 --> 01:10:43,337
I haven't, I think.

1031
01:10:43,548 --> 01:10:46,720
Your awning extends eleven
inches further out the law allows.

1032
01:10:47,162 --> 01:10:49,310
That costs about fifty
dollars to have it changed.

1033
01:10:49,603 --> 01:10:50,272
Fine.

1034
01:10:53,452 --> 01:10:56,550
Now you see this little girl.
If she was working here as a waitress.

1035
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:59,980
Every time I'd be coming by,
I'd be smiling in at her.

1036
01:11:01,379 --> 01:11:03,022
Instead of seeing your awning.

1037
01:11:08,104 --> 01:11:09,477
It's six o'clock, Carol.

1038
01:11:10,647 --> 01:11:12,248
Tired?
- I sure am.

1039
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:17,667
Here you are, Mrs Wade.
- Thank you.

1040
01:11:18,087 --> 01:11:19,218
Sorry it ain't more.

1041
01:11:19,429 --> 01:11:21,002
You haven't heard me complaining?

1042
01:11:21,213 --> 01:11:22,535
No, ma'am.
- Goodnight.

1043
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:25,511
Well. How's the little lady tonight?

1044
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:28,655
I'm fine thank you, Mr Clancy.
- Your husband, is he better today?

1045
01:11:28,957 --> 01:11:30,459
He's actually begun to walk around.

1046
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:33,666
That's fine. Then it's entirely
happy you must be now.

1047
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:38,170
Yes .. I'm happy but ..
- But what?

1048
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:44,329
I'm grateful that I could take
care of Bill when he needed me.

1049
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,090
But now he's better, there's ..

1050
01:11:48,252 --> 01:11:50,400
There is something I've ..
- I know what you mean.

1051
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,515
More peace to your mind.

1052
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,636
Well goodnight, Mr Clancy.
- Goodnight.

1053
01:12:01,343 --> 01:12:02,619
[ Door knocks ]

1054
01:12:04,099 --> 01:12:04,977
Go away.

1055
01:12:05,535 --> 01:12:08,214
I don't want any rags, any
bones or any bottles today.

1056
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,573
I ..

1057
01:12:13,869 --> 01:12:15,180
Tony.
- Bill.

1058
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:17,556
I've searched all over town for you.

1059
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,845
It's taken me six weeks to find you.
- It's cheaper to move than pay rent.

1060
01:12:21,172 --> 01:12:23,158
But you found me.
That makes the day perfect.

1061
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:26,063
Well, how is the kid metallurgist?
- Great, Bill.

1062
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:29,852
Why .. what's the matter?
You haven't been sick, have you?

1063
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:32,826
No, no. I've just got
a pain in my stomach.

1064
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,867
When a truck I was driving
wrapped itself around me.

1065
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:37,714
Were <i>you </i>driving a truck?

1066
01:12:38,163 --> 01:12:40,246
Gosh Bill, things must have
been pretty tough for you.

1067
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:42,605
The last six months haven't
been any bed of roses.

1068
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:45,450
No post-mortems. Let's talk about
something else. How are you?

1069
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,323
Fine.

1070
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:48,854
Who do you think I ran into
the first night I got to town?

1071
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,351
I don't know. Who?
- That girl you nearly married once.

1072
01:12:51,562 --> 01:12:52,483
Carol Morgan.

1073
01:12:53,383 --> 01:12:54,263
Carol? Where?

1074
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:57,270
I always said she'd end up on
the streets and she sure did.

1075
01:12:57,605 --> 01:13:00,023
Tried to pick me up: 'Hello, mister'.

1076
01:13:00,383 --> 01:13:02,613
When she saw who it was .. oh boy.

1077
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:04,182
And did I tell her?

1078
01:13:04,525 --> 01:13:06,341
'Get away from me you tramp'.

1079
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:13,856
Bill .. I know it's a shock.

1080
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:16,297
Just supposed you'd married her then?

1081
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,826
How do you feel now?

1082
01:13:18,624 --> 01:13:19,513
Don't talk.

1083
01:13:21,848 --> 01:13:23,419
Don't take it so hard, Bill.

1084
01:13:23,856 --> 01:13:25,196
Think of what you escaped.

1085
01:13:27,298 --> 01:13:29,726
Carol and I were married six months ago.

1086
01:13:37,616 --> 01:13:40,183
Any rags, any bones,
any bottles today, mister?

1087
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:49,780
Hello, Tony.

1088
01:13:55,957 --> 01:13:56,704
Oh.

1089
01:13:58,316 --> 01:13:59,967
I see. You've told him.

1090
01:14:16,655 --> 01:14:18,415
I'm sorry it worked out this way, Bill.

1091
01:14:19,796 --> 01:14:21,169
I was going to tell you.

1092
01:14:22,575 --> 01:14:24,658
I was only waiting until
you were working again.

1093
01:14:26,414 --> 01:14:28,109
So I could tell you and then go away.

1094
01:14:30,974 --> 01:14:31,922
It's alright.

1095
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:34,375
I know just how you feel.

1096
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:38,409
I wouldn't expect you
to feel any other way.

1097
01:14:40,336 --> 01:14:41,606
I knew that when I ..

1098
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,175
When I .. did it.

1099
01:14:46,244 --> 01:14:47,939
And if I had to do it all over again.

1100
01:14:49,671 --> 01:14:51,011
It would be just the same.

1101
01:14:54,094 --> 01:14:55,075
So I'll go.

1102
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:00,058
Bill, this is .. terrible.

1103
01:15:03,243 --> 01:15:04,109
Terrible?

1104
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,209
Yes .. yes it is terrible.

1105
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,152
But it's wonderful, Tony.

1106
01:15:18,123 --> 01:15:19,208
I owe my life.

1107
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:21,622
I owe everything that
life may mean to me.

1108
01:15:22,337 --> 01:15:23,325
To Carol.

1109
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:25,674
We've been hungry together.

1110
01:15:26,098 --> 01:15:28,184
She's cooked my food, washed my clothes.

1111
01:15:28,843 --> 01:15:30,049
Taken care of me.

1112
01:15:31,737 --> 01:15:32,495
And now.

1113
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:34,162
Now this.

1114
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,792
I wondered where the
money was coming from.

1115
01:15:40,672 --> 01:15:42,561
It must have taken a
lot to keep me alive.

1116
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:56,036
Carol, you can't go.
I couldn't live without you.

1117
01:15:56,768 --> 01:15:59,601
I have to go, Bill.
Don't you see? I have to go.

1118
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:01,354
This never happened.

1119
01:16:01,565 --> 01:16:03,487
It doesn't exist.
It's done, it's finished.

1120
01:16:03,738 --> 01:16:04,708
No it isn't.

1121
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,545
I wish it were.

1122
01:16:07,873 --> 01:16:11,157
You are just being noble, Bill. You're
saying these things out of gratitude.

1123
01:16:11,368 --> 01:16:13,451
Gratitude? What has
gratitude got to do with it?

1124
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,432
We have gratitude for little things.
- I can't stay, Bill. I can't stay.

1125
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:19,674
You can't go.

1126
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:24,140
Look, you can't go. My arms are
holding you and my arms are too strong.

1127
01:16:25,338 --> 01:16:27,329
Even though my legs are a little weak.

1128
01:16:28,019 --> 01:16:29,176
And if you cry ..

1129
01:16:29,629 --> 01:16:31,421
I'm not going to tell you the good news.

1130
01:16:32,577 --> 01:16:34,539
I've got a job .. a <i>real</i> job.

1131
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,079
It may be only 60 or 70 a week.

1132
01:16:37,633 --> 01:16:39,334
60 or 70 a week?

1133
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,279
Yes, it's in the advertising business.

1134
01:16:41,748 --> 01:16:43,244
And don't you say 'sausages'.

1135
01:16:43,472 --> 01:16:46,411
Sausages .. sausages .. sausages ..

1136
01:17:04,073 --> 01:17:04,799
..t-g..
