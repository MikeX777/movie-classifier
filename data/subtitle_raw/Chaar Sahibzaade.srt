1
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,616
The first Guru of Sikhs,

2
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,349
Shri Guru Nanak Devji taught
the world about humanity,

3
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,351
equality and love,

4
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,720
He taught everyone
how to find happiness in

5
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,114
their lives as they practiced
the religion of their choice.

6
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,191
But the Turkish and Mughal Invaders

7
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,749
always thought themselves to be superior
than any other kingdom in the world

8
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,920
They were looting the country ruthlessly
and were forcing their religion on all.

9
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,191
Fearing the bloodshed,
looting and conversion,

10
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,118
the Kashmiri Pundits came rushing
towards Guru Teg Bahadur for help.

11
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,550
<i>To everyone's amazement, the 8 year old</i>

12
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,996
Guru Gobind Singh stood
up for the Kashmiri Pundits,

13
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
and pleaded to his father Guru Teg
Bahadur to fight against this injustice.

14
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,631
Guru Teg Bahadur fought for
the rights of the Kashmiri Pundits.

15
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,373
He travelled to Delhi for their cause,

16
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,719
for their "human rights”, even
when this word was not coined,

17
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,038
but Instead was beheaded by the Mughals.

18
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,631
“The loot,
torture and injustice never stopped...

19
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,719
As the young Guru Gobind
Singh grew up he took a decision.

20
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,589
To stand up against injustice,
fight for one's rights.

21
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,312
He took to spreading knowledge
to the world with his writings,

22
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,678
and fight Injustice with his sword.

23
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,611
In Shri Anandpur Sahib
he created the Khalsa,

24
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,199
the pure, the fearless, which shook
the Mughal Empire from their slumber!

25
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,351
He stood up for the truth,
for people's rights

26
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,353
and their freedom to practice
a religion of their choice....

27
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,116
...in the process sacrificed
everything he had even his four sons!

28
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,790
Shri Anandpur Sahib

29
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,597
On one end the bursting river Satluj

30
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,320
and on the other was the calm flowing
River Sirsa reflecting the sky's

31
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,913
deep blue shade.

32
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,516
It was here in these beautiful meadows,

33
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,031
that the four sons of Guru Sahib, grew
up. amidst sounds of fun and laughter.

34
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,231
They would rise with the
beat of the naggada drums exciting

35
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,635
everyone around who
would look upon them in awe!

36
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,079
Guru Father has asked you

37
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,198
to make me sit on the white elephant and
let us witness our brothers horse-racing

38
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,033
He told you about me too

39
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,795
Oh yes..he said to make
Fateh Singh sit on it too!

40
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,314
But no one told me..

41
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,879
Hurry up !

42
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,195
I can't see my brothers from here please
move the elephant a little further

43
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,674
Jujhar Singh!

44
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,549
Look there! Both of them
are coming towards the bridge

45
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,000
This bridge. Oh no! it almost
collapsed yesterday

46
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,119
Jujhar Singh!

47
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,994
Ride easy Shero easy we have
to let the younger brother win

48
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,311
Jujhar brother has won!
Jujhar brother has won the race!

49
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,312
Gulab Singhi you
can help us get us down now

50
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,599
But Guru Father hasn't
instructed me to do that..

51
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,272
You can ride the horse very well now

52
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,513
A Brahmin has come seeking for
help, Guru Father has called for you

53
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,553
Oh Grateful Guru,

54
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,551
I have knocked many doors,

55
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,711
asking for help,

56
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,838
but no one has stood up for me....

57
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,516
we did not even consummate our marriage

58
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,717
and that pathan abducted
my newly-wed wife.

59
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,234
Only you can help me now...

60
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,158
No one who came seeking help from
Guru Sahib ever went disappointed...

61
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,239
As you wish Guru Father

62
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,312
One Universal Creator God. By Guru's grace.

63
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,997
Those heads adorned with braided hair,
'with their parts painted with vermillion

64
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,717
those heads were shaved with scissors,
and their throats were choked with dust.

65
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,910
When our country was attacked by Babar,

66
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,959
Shri Guru Nanak Devji, explains
the plight of people in his writings..

67
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,594
...how newly married women
were tortured, others were widowed,

68
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,758
how they were left with no where to go,

69
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,873
Seeing the plight of people,
and realizing their grief,

70
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,390
Guru Sahib asked Babar,

71
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,110
“does it not even pain you a
bit seeing the massacre you have done?"

72
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,272
Grandma, was Babar such a cruel man?

73
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,153
Were people In his ruls so unhappy?

74
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,596
Even the people under
the rule of the King

75
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,358
sitting In Delhi aren't happy either.

76
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,433
Brother,
are you talking about Aurangzeb ?

77
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,431
Yes, lashing cruelty on his
people has become a habit for him

78
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,556
'You seem to know a lot about
the cruelty of the treacherous,

79
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,549
but do you even remember the Gurbaani
that your grandma has taught you or not?

80
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,434
Gurbaani is so simple Guru Mother.
It comes to you so effortlessly.

81
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,989
Guru Mother,
we will recite some for you

82
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,711
I bow to the Primal Guru,
I bow to the Guru of the ages.

83
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,999
<i>I bow to the True Guru.
I bow to the Great, Divine Guru.</i>

84
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,391
Fateh and Zorawar are dolng well,

85
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,239
How is your learning of
Sanskrit and Parsi going?

86
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,315
Guru mother, I can not only speak, but
read and write in Sanskrit and Parsi too

87
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,958
Guru Mother,
he can now rice the horse very well too.

88
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,439
Really?

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,551
Very soon, a sword will
be swaying in your son's hand.

90
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,317
What are you thinking Guru Mother?

91
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,633
My son, when you will be in full
armour with a sword in hand

92
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,872
would you look as gracious..

93
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,031
..as your eider brother?

94
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,590
Guru Mother I would obviously
take your blessings before I go to war.

95
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,354
So you can see
for yourself how I look

96
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,796
May God bless you with best art
of warfare. How is your Gatka training?

97
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,119
Oh Guru Mother, they always
indulge me in their conversations

98
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,874
Grandma can we...

99
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,434
Okay go

100
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,876
Devki Das

101
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,234
Guru Father has told me ta Inform you

102
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,789
that if someone tries
to trouble your wife again,

103
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,758
you should ready
yourself to protect her.

104
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,194
I promise Ajit Singh Ji

105
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,276
I am very grateful to Guru Sahib
that he sent you to help me and my wife

106
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,593
May the Khalsa keep
protecting everyone in need!

107
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,555
<i>Where had you vanished?</i>

108
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,318
Brother Jujhar
is doing great today

109
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,676
I had gone to tell
Guru Father all about it

110
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,752
Ajit Singh Ji,
Jujhar Singh is on a rampage today.

111
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,434
He is not even letting
anyone close to him.

112
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,198
My little brother is now
ready to train as a warrior

113
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,397
Brother, please let
me learn sword fighting now,

114
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,513
Master too thinks that
I am ready for it...

115
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,590
Yes Jujhar Singh's body movements are very swift, and controlled now

116
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,198
In fact I have already learnt some
of the moves with the sword on my own

117
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,159
If you want I can display them

118
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,510
Master.

119
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,310
Okay.

120
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,913
come Mehar Singh

121
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,316
Hold on

122
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,033
<i>Give me the sword</i>

123
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,030
I would like to see what my
little brother has learnt on his own

124
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,840
Amazing!

125
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,840
Wow! you have learnt well,
you could block my strike

126
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,554
One's focus in the battle should
not be just to strike down your enemy

127
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,671
but to protect yourself
from being struck.

128
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,640
So you should always
keep your defence strong.

129
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,959
Brother I think,

130
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,078
now I am strong enough to make
the enemy loose his sword in battle

131
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,674
Is it?

132
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,514
Mehar Singh Ji.

133
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,557
He is ready now

134
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,672
Start his training with no delay.

135
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,154
But remember Brother

136
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,711
the sword of Singh only
rises to defend, never to attack.

137
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,558
Now you should learn the Gatka
quickly, only then will my turn come soon

138
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,475
Brother! Oh Brother! please
save me from brother Jujhar

139
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,071
What's wrong?

140
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,551
Oh Brother, he bit my hand.
Look at this.

141
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,551
Then why did you pull my ear?

142
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,234
Because you put your hand
smeared with spices in my eye

143
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,558
Yes Brother.
Look at his eyes, they're so watery

144
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,394
Fateh Singh?

145
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,914
Forgive me brother

146
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,120
But you will have to get punished for this

147
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,918
Now we will make his eyes watery
too, by making him laugh continuously

148
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,597
Hold on. Whare are you running now?

149
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,514
Oh Brother...I'm not
going to talk to you.

150
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,195
You sided with brother
Jujhar and did not take my side

151
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,389
And how is that?

152
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,040
You just believed what
he said and then started tickling me

153
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,316
You didn't even try putting my smeared hands
with spice into your eyes,

154
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,629
to check If it hurts or not?

155
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,916
Brother, Fateh Singh
is a clever little fellow,

156
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,356
we must send him to Kashi to leam
Sanskrit like the other learned ones

157
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,751
No brother, I will never
leave you all and go anywhere

158
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,200
Okay,
That's fine

159
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,914
'You would have to do voluntary
service for fellowmen,

160
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,196
Just like Bhai Kanhaiya had done

161
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,600
Brother, once you were about to tell
me something about Bhal Kanhaiya, what was it?

162
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,398
May I, Brother?

163
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,157
Once a Singh complained
to Guru Father that

164
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,269
Bhai Kanhaiya serves water to the
Turkish soldiers after the battle,

165
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,431
Bhal Kanhaiya came forward and said

166
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,231
"Guruji . your Singh's
fight to kill the enemy

167
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,353
and I give them water
to kill the animosity in them”

168
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,229
Guru Father smiled and said "Kanhaiya,

169
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,717
from now on, please take soms medical aid too!

170
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,033
I too will become, a saint soldier
like my Guru Father. when I grow up!

171
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,434
<i>What happened Gangu?</i>

172
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,638
I sent wheat crumbs with sugar
and buter for the kids through you

173
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,599
and you brought it back untouched ?

174
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,753
What could I possibly do Mataji? All your
Son's have locked themselves in the room

175
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,230
and have ordered
not to disturb them till dusk.

176
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,396
Whenever the four
of them get together,

177
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,431
they always come with some surprise

178
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,113
Mother dear. do you have any
idea what they are up to this time?

179
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,239
Tomorrow my grandchildren
will sing hymns in praise of the

180
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,473
Guru who brought enlightenment
to this dark world.

181
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,896
Waheguru

182
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,630
Waheguru

183
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,638
Waheguru

184
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,511
Waheguru

185
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,512
With the emergence
of the true Guru Nanak.

186
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,512
The mist cleared and the
light scattered all around.

187
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,075
Waheguru

188
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,470
Waheguru

189
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,311
With the emergence
of the true Guru Nanak.

190
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,076
The mist cleared and the
light scattered all around.

191
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:47,440
As if at the sunrise, the stars
disappeared and the darkness dispelled.

192
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,194
The stars disappeared
and the darkness dispelled.

193
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:00,149
With the emergence
of the true Guru Nanak.

194
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,950
With the roar of the lion in the forest,
the flocks of escaping deer

195
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,477
now cannot have endurance.

196
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,312
Whenever Baba put his feet,

197
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,078
a religious place was
erected and established.

198
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,757
The mist cleared and the
light scattered all around.

199
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,594
With the emergence
of the true Guru Nanak.

200
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,080
All the siddh-places now have
been renamed on the name of Nanak.

201
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Everyhome has become a
place of dharma where singing.

202
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,870
the mist cleared and the
light scattered all around.

203
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,197
With the emergence
of the true Guru Nanak.

204
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Baba liberated all four directions
and nine divisions of earth.

205
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,071
Gurmukh (Guru Nanak) has emerged
in this kaliyug, the dark age.

206
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,798
Gurmukh (Guru Nanak) has emerged
in this kaliyug, the dark age.

207
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,637
The mist cleared and the
light scattered all around.

208
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,915
With the emergence of the
true Guru Nanak.

209
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,198
The mist cleared and the
light scattered all around.

210
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:06,600
As if at the sun rise the stars
disappeared and the darkness dispelled.

211
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,080
The stars disappeared
and the darkness dispelled.

212
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,196
With the emergence of the
true Guru Nanak.

213
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,078
Waheguru

214
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,718
Waheguru

215
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,677
Waheguru

216
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,318
Waheguru

217
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,354
I'm sure my grandchildren
have made my son proud today.

218
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,034
1 wish such happiness stays
with us for all times to come..

219
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,072
But these good times
did not last long,

220
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,554
<i>the Mughals were forcing conversions</i>

221
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,998
and Guru Sahib's Khalsapanth would oppose it!

222
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,114
People from all casts and relgion

223
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,670
started to work closely with Guru
Sahib and felt elated in following His path

224
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,952
His increasing popularity
and power was becoming a huge

225
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,439
cancern amongst the Mughals

226
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,558
and the Hindu Kings from
the surrounding hill's provinces.

227
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,519
Wazir Khan was sweating
in the winters of North India.

228
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,554
He just didn't know what to do.

229
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,153
We have lost endless battles
from the Guru and his Singhs

230
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,909
Call for hundreds or thousands of
men from Delhi and finish them off!

231
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,193
Isn't there a way, where we can
win this without going to war?

232
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,437
By the death of Just one person

233
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,797
the Khalsa would loose all it's
motivation and crash into peices

234
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,273
I understand my Lord but who would
Dare to be able to slay the Guru ?

235
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,556
The most ruthless and powerful
General of the Mughal Empire - Painde Khan.

236
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,039
Govind, why should we
shed the blood of our soldiers?

237
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,071
Let the two of us have a
duel and settle this war right here!

238
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,190
Guru Sahib asked for permission
from The Five Chosen Ones

239
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,432
Hmmm...get ready to fight Gobind!

240
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,875
Bole so nihaal...

241
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,398
sat sri akaal....

242
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,471
Make the first move Gobind!

243
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,038
Guru sahib explained 'the
Khalsa never attacks first.

244
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,319
you have challenged Painde
Khan, how can I make the first move?'

245
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,910
No you have to make the first move

246
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,033
Guru Sahib then told
him 'Think it over Painde Khan

247
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,079
it may so happen that your desire
to attack me, may remain unfulfilled

248
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,673
You may regret that.'

249
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,950
<i>Then defend yourself!</i>

250
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,358
Dina Begh Sahib Painde
Khan's arrow has never

251
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,671
missed its target. It's
ready now to crush the Khalsa

252
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,917
Before aiming his arrow Guru
Sahib praved, "You are omnipresent God,

253
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,400
You are there in every human being, but
at this moment what stands before me,

254
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,711
is someone's armogance'

255
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,238
You can pray to god now Painde khan!

256
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,713
I am covered from
head to toe in my armor,

257
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,871
does he really think his arrow
can pierce me anywhere?

258
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,310
What dose he think of himself,
this Hind ka Pir

259
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,560
Wazir khan had a nervous breakdown when
he heard about the death of Painde khan

260
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,072
He then focused on the
Hindu Kings of the Hill States

261
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,036
Wazir khan has sent a proposal,

262
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,077
that we should join hands with him

263
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,878
to finishing the rising
power of Guru Gobind Singh

264
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,918
We should definitely not align with
that cunning Wazir Khan.

265
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,673
Not against Guru Gobind

266
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,591
We have lost all the battles we fought
with Guru Gobind. and retreated every time

267
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,197
And in spite of that he never took over a
single piece of land from your Kingdom

268
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,675
I am sure, that by doing that, there
must be a trap he is setting.

269
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,516
You are right if Wazir was not in panic,
he wouldn't have sent this proposal

270
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,150
We would agree to whatever
you decide King Ajmer Chand

271
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,392
“The Hindu Kings of the Hill States
and the Mughals formed an alliance and

272
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,199
surrounded the fort of Anandpur.
The battle begun, six months passed by.

273
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,992
Hard winters set in, the cold
weather had the Mughals falling ill.

274
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,556
Prolonged war had
it their treasuries.

275
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,758
<i>Their armies had started to rebel.</i>

276
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,554
The situation in the fort was not

277
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,630
any better, six months had gone by.
rations had exhausted.

278
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,598
Thers was very little food left.

279
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Not able to bear hunger anymore about
100 Sikhs decided to leave the Fort

280
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,639
Guru Sahib sent his mother
to attend to these Sikhs

281
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,509
Your Guru has accepted your plea

282
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,557
You just have to write on this
paper that you are no more his Singh's

283
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,319
and he is not your Guru anymore.

284
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,198
We are ready to wiits

285
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,554
There is nothing but famine
and death left in this fort now

286
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,357
It's better to leave the fort now

287
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,158
If there is any other Singh
who does not want to be Singh anymore,

288
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,239
He can leave with them

289
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,312
Out of the 100 who wanted
to leave only 40 left.

290
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,234
The conscience of the rest
did not allow them to leave

291
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,751
Sipah-e-Silhar i
can see some Sikhs there.

292
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,238
Hold on seems like they are fleeing
away from the fort let them go

293
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,552
I think you are right, Sir

294
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,192
Before our army rebels
and the siege breaks

295
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,159
wish all the Sikhs
flee and we win the Fort.

296
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,070
Even after betraying once,

297
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,313
Wazir khan had the audacity
to send another proposal through

298
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,516
Emissary for ceasefire,

299
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,110
Mughals swore by their religion and
the Hindu Kings swore by the Holy Cow.

300
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,072
That if Guru Gobind Singh leaves
the fort they would never trespass

301
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,389
his way ever again and that he's free
1090 anywhere.

302
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,520
Guru Sahib, upen request from his core
team accepted this offer and decided to

303
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,593
empty the Anandpur Fort.

304
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,079
Zorawar Singh, Fateh Singh.
Hurry up, mother is waiting for you.

305
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,358
Brother Ajit we want to stay with you

306
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,030
You should stay with your Guru Mother
and Grandma...take care of them

307
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,239
Then you should come with us
too. All of us will take care of them.

308
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,717
No little brother, we will
be in the last flank of the convoy to

309
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,110
ensure everyone is protected,

310
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,749
Now we would meet wherever
we set our camp next

311
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,439
And if you don't turn up?

312
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,559
Wherever you both
will go, we will fellow you...

313
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,190
Okay fine. Lat's go now

314
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,473
Brother, I feel like
hugging you tight.

315
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,359
Me too...

316
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:18,873
The brothers stood hugging,
what a moment it was to be!

317
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,318
The stars were wondering
and the skies locked down quietly

318
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:33,758
They were going their separate ways.
From Anandpur.

319
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,953
Leaving their home forever,
in pairs of two...

320
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:49,640
How unfortunate,
they were parting never to meet again

321
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,710
The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's

322
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,635
The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's

323
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,156
The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's

324
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,592
My Lord Khan,
as agreed, the Guru and his Sikhs

325
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,353
have emptied the Fort peacefully for us

326
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,393
What am I going to do with the
damned fort?

327
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,790
All I wanted was for Gobind to
be out of his Fort in the open.

328
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,073
Your wish has been fulilled,
what are you waiting for?

329
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,637
We cannot do this Sirl We swore by our
religion and they swore by the Holy Cow

330
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,358
Swore?

331
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,239
As soon as they cross the border
of Kiratpur, strike them from the back!

332
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,799
I want the Guru Killed and
don't leave a single Singh alive!

333
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,678
Wazir Khan and the Hindu
Kings have betrayed us!

334
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,475
Again, thousands of
soldiers are following us

335
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,355
No problem. We will stop them

336
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,191
But how? Ajit Singh Ji we are
in hundreds and they are In thousands...

337
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,233
Look at that gorgs in the mountains

338
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,432
There is no way that thousands
of men can pass through it, in one go

339
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,756
My dear fellow men, it's just before
day-break, Guru Sahib has said that

340
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,753
<i>we should recite the
hymns from “Asaa & vaar”</i>

341
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,435
Brother Mokham Singh!
-yes?

342
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,433
Another group of Mughal and
Rajput soldiers are corming our way!

343
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,319
These two brothers should not be here

344
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,352
Ajit Singh, I think that
the enemy can take another route

345
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,478
and attack our fellowmen
by the river. We should go and check

346
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,435
You go ahead. I will follow you

347
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,158
Drop that rock onto the passage
to narrow it

348
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,276
Where are we heading?

349
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,749
We are going towards the banks
of Sirsa, to check if all is safe

350
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,274
Get lost you...

351
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,714
<i>Waheguru Ji ka khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki faten.</i>

352
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,918
Bhai Daya Singh we have
lost more than half our Singhs

353
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,676
'You have the women and children with you,
the waters of the Sirsa are rising!

354
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,798
You should start crossing the
river and take Ajit Singh with you.

355
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,594
Ajit Singh didn't turn up,

356
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,434
I have to get him out of that war

357
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,670
Create a wall right here! None
shall pass towards the river banks

358
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,754
Brother Ajit Singh,
the waters of Sirsa are rising

359
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,672
Guru Father has called for you.

360
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,110
Okay.

361
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,472
Be careful the current
is strong down under. One mistake

362
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,200
and you will bs washed away

363
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,671
We are not able to break
into the Singhs defense.

364
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,236
Go on the hill top
and attack from behind!

365
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,840
Bhai Sahib Singh Ji we
have been attacked from behind!

366
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,314
Come!

367
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,833
Bole so nihaal...

368
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,874
Careful!

369
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,270
It dangerous to
cross Sirsa as of now.

370
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,237
<i>'We should take the
'bridge and follow them</i>

371
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,840
Mata Ji,

372
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,536
Sirsa held on to the fateful four

373
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,796
Sirsa held on to the fateful four

374
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,156
We looked all around
but did not see anyone

375
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,113
Bhai Mani Singh, I think
we should head towards Delhi now

376
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,990
Though Her strong currents ware cruel

377
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,918
1 will go and check once again.

378
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,833
Maybe I'll find someone.
Brother Ajit or someone

379
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,710
We shouldn't stay here for long. We
should leave this place immediately

380
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,749
Come on kids! Gangu is
right. As God wishes so it be

381
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,155
The ones that she wanted to cross aver

382
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,959
Sirsa did not let them drown...

383
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,039
They must have waited
but sensing the danger.

384
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,233
Must have left for Delhi
as we had decided earlier

385
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,036
Yes.

386
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,320
'We've been asked to head towards
'Bur Majra' via 'Kotla Nihang'

387
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,096
Had the waters of the
Sirsa River remained calm

388
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,431
Had the waters of the
Sirsa River remained calm

389
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,955
that day history would
have been different.

390
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,476
Guru Sahib's Family got separated

391
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,714
His mother walked with
Gangu to his village Kheri,

392
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,311
Guru Sahib camped in the
mud Fort of Chaudhary Budu Chand,

393
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,280
from where He had earlier
fought a battle too.

394
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,517
This fort is at a good
height and it has 4 gates

395
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,759
it will be impossible for the enemy to
attack from these three steep gates

396
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,759
So its only this main gate which
we need to watch there are bushes

397
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,390
<i>'and small mounds outside this gate,.</i>

398
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,553
Though we should patrol
and take guard on all the gates.

399
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,632
We need to guard this gate carefully

400
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,270
If the enemy strikes this
is where it is going to be.

401
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,755
Himmat Singh Ji,

402
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,514
we have placed cur soldiers to guard
all the four entrances to the mud fort.

403
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,239
But our resources are limited.

404
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,958
But our courage is unlimited!

405
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,996
Pleased to hear that!

406
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,270
Good we picked up more
weapons on our way here

407
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,634
You're right!

408
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,797
Come let's go and meet Guru Father

409
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,719
See this.

410
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,434
Guru Father

411
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,917
Just as you said, we have placed
soldiers all around the Mud Fort.

412
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,674
Guru Sahib as you had asked
the injured Singhs are being given

413
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,671
first aid as we speak

414
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,996
We will keep a close
watch from this Fort

415
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,555
“The Mughal Army can
be here any time now

416
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,118
Ajit Singh, we had almost
forgotten about our "sharpest lookout".

417
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,592
Listen very carefully - People
of Chamkour! Listen carefully

418
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,918
This is a message from the King of
our land and his Governor Wazir khan

419
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,760
Listen carefully!!

420
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,874
Guru Of Anandpur and his

421
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,510
Singhs have taken refuge
in the Mud Fort of Chamkour

422
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,477
The Governor has warned that any person

423
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:43,560
who tries to help the Guru
or his Singhs shall be beheaded,

424
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,629
My child! I made these butter
wheat crumbs especially for you,

425
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,239
where are u taking them?

426
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,472
Mother, the Guru of
Anandpur and his Singhs

427
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,554
have come to the Mud Fort.
Everyone is taking something for them

428
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,677
So I decided to take this.

429
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,958
Oh no my child! Please don't do that. Who
knows what trouble you will get us into?

430
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,195
Why not?

431
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,591
Why are you trying to scare
the child? He is doing such a noble deed.

432
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,710
You go ahead dear

433
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,313
I'm leaving Grandma

434
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,711
You are trying to make your
child like those 40 coward Sikhs

435
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,434
'who left the Guru in his Fort,

436
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,279
Do you know when they wet back home

437
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,193
what humiliation they
faced from their families?

438
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,033
Here take these
bangles and wear them!!

439
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,835
Sit and cook! Here give
me your sword this Guru's

440
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,673
"Singhni' will go and fight
for him in the battlefield

441
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,997
- But listen
- Don't touch me.

442
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,519
Agaln, the one who cant be a 'Singh'

443
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,238
of the Guru cannot be
a 'Singh' of this 'Singhnl*

444
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,518
I am going to fight
his foes on my own

445
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,477
You Idiot!
'You offered your head to the Guru

446
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,837
and was baptized by the him
to be a Singh, to fight Injustice!

447
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,275
And you left him and ran back home

448
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,194
You 40 ran back to
the comforts of your home?

449
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,398
Mata Gujri son was
also as hungry as you.

450
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,195
It seems you cowards were
not worthy to live in the lions den

451
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,391
Went to become better beings

452
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,433
Forgive me mother,

453
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,678
the love for my own
child had made me weak

454
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,918
and I forgot what the principles we
Singhs stand for.

455
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:30,116
Before this warning call of
the guard scares another mother like me...

456
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,671
Listen carefully pacple of Chamkour

457
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,596
This is a message from the King of
our land and his Governor...

458
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,235
Oh God! Please have mercy

459
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,676
<i>'Bhag Singh Ji lock there!</i>

460
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,237
Two kids in the cover of bushes
are coming towards this Mud Fort

461
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,232
Come! Let's have a look

462
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,435
Hmm...

463
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,394
Who are you?

464
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,269
We heard that the Guru of Anandpur
has come again to this Mud Fort

465
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,634
so I got some sweet
wheat crumbs for him

466
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,829
and I some butter-sugar

467
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,356
But the Mughals have warned the
villagers not to help us

468
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,953
Weren't you scared?

469
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,238
If Guru Sahib does not fear
the Mughals, then we too don't fear them

470
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,752
Singh Ji please take their contribution
and give it Guru Father immediately

471
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,229
Sure

472
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,635
Who is this?

473
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,115
He is the Guru's younger son

474
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,315
Really?

475
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,397
Consider us like your younger brothers.
allow us to join your army too.

476
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,159
Brother

477
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,999
You did not reply?

478
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,114
'You cared for our need for
food, took the risk of coming here,

479
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,510
this deed is no less
than that of a true soldier.

480
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,159
Bhag Slngh Ji

481
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,279
Please make sure these two young
soldiers reach their houses safely

482
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,597
Almost there Mata Ji,
it must be less than half a mile now.

483
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,159
Look! There it is!

484
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,269
Kumma! Hey Kumma!

485
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,998
What's troubling you Jujhar Singh

486
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,115
I was just missing
our younger brothers

487
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,671
Why had waters of the Sirsa river
to rise today only, it separated us all

488
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,232
Don't you worry little brother,

489
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,113
Guru Mother and some Singh's are with

490
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,119
them. They probably have reached
Delhi by now!

491
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,750
Gangu be careful, Take the
narrow pathway next to the river

492
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,116
It will lead you
straight to your village

493
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,312
But isn't the wider road a better way?
It's short as well

494
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,634
But the risk is greater. The Mughal
army patrols frequently on that road

495
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,240
O'Gangu, Kumma ls tight

496
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,314
So what if it's a difficult path
but we should be careful and safe.

497
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,553
When would we be with our Guru Father,
Guru Mother and our brothers Grandma

498
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,798
We all have gone different ways

499
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,474
to confuse the enemy

500
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,312
The moment the area ls secure

501
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,109
our brothers will come
to fetch us, isn't it grandma?

502
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,840
1 just hope thay all are safe and secure.

503
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,198
Sube Sirhind zindabad ,

504
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,996
Maan Singh Ji, what do you think is the
strength of the Mughal soldiers?

505
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,390
Approximately one milion

506
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,519
One million to fight us
42. Mughals surely are terrorized

507
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,477
by the power of the Singh's!

508
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,318
Well said Juhar!

509
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,196
I knew you were intelligent
and smart but now it seems

510
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,994
that you have a lot of wisdom too

511
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,989
Sva laakh se aik ladao, tabhe
Gobind Singh naam kahaun!

512
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,398
Let's show them now

513
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,673
how one Sikh fights more than 2 hundred
thousand alone

514
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:15,190
Bole so nlhal, sat sri akaal

515
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,753
Naban mian,

516
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,520
You told me that they are
just a handful of Singh's in there

517
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,432
I heard there were only 100 my lord

518
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,434
But their 'Jakara' almost deafened my
ears. I think they are more than that...

519
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,033
Maybe more joined them

520
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,751
How many more 100...500...a thousand?
We are a million

521
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,833
I am going over to discuss
this with Wazir Khan in his marquee

522
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,949
You can leave. All I know is

523
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,913
that not a single one of them
will live to see another day

524
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,557
Guru Sahib is all knowing

525
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,754
<i>How could he sleep that night?</i>

526
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,759
In deep thoughts the Guru walked
to where his Singhs were resting...

527
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,200
Just like a father would come
to care of his children while they're asleep

528
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,790
He walked slowly,
taking steps as soft as he could

529
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,433
He was touched by the
unconditional love shown by them.

530
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,995
He looked upon all of them,
showering his blessings

531
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,679
These Singhs were going to
brace death as the Sun rose

532
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,795
These Khalsa's were going
to be martyred in the battle soon.

533
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,989
Engrossed watching his
Singh's as he moved further,

534
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,670
He saw his two sons in
deep sleep just like others

535
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,671
As he moved further
from where they slept

536
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,800
He paused, looked back,
stood and watched them thinking

537
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,118
"Sons, you will be at rest
before the Sun sets tomorrow

538
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,511
Your souls will find eternal
peace in God's own arms”

539
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,831
O Waheguru! We do not hesitate
to die fighting injustice

540
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,833
As Our body, soul, all
belong to you, nothing is ours

541
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,233
He sat watching,
observing, caressing his sons

542
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,914
Just as one would,
appreciating a bunch of flowers

543
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,713
He walked on further caring and
treating their wounds

544
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,152
Comforting his Singhs,

545
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,477
<i>'Buckling them in their blankets</i>

546
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,918
One has never seen such
heart rendering moments

547
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,756
Neither has one heard of
such soul stirring occurrences

548
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,158
O! One can swear by the Lord and
Nanak himself,

549
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,914
How much ever you may sing in praise
of Guru Gobind, Its never enough!

550
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,640
Soldiers Attack!

551
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,077
Cover your heads with shields!

552
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,595
Shoot the arrows!

553
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,996
Do not stop firing arrows at them,

554
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,593
Such that Singhs cannot
come out from the Fort

555
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,756
and shoot arrows, and
our men can reach it

556
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,318
Shoot the arrows!

557
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,193
Brother...

558
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,430
Let's go to the corners of the
Fort and shoot arrows at their legs.

559
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,952
Hold your arrows! Do not
Shoot! You might injure our men

560
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,519
Move ahead!

561
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,799
Nihar!

562
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,669
Hold on

563
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,639
We will have to change our strategy.

564
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,996
1 gave you mnilion
soldiers Khwaza Mohammad

565
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,158
and you couldn't capture
handful of Singhs ?

566
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,118
Now go with your full
strength and kill them all

567
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,876
My Lord they are sitting at a
height, hence we have a disadvantage.

568
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,758
If we attack them head
on with all our soldiers

569
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,912
'we would lose at
least 20 thousand men

570
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,875
No.. no.

571
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,635
That's too big a number! Wait

572
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,953
Let me think about It

573
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,115
Hmm..

574
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,159
Do as I say!

575
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,190
Station your men at least 10 meters
away from the range of their arrows

576
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,872
Singhs will have
only two options then

577
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,477
Either they would come
out of the Fort to fight

578
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,672
and will be ripped apart by
our archers before they can reach us,

579
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,040
or they would come out with their
Guru to plead for mercy before me

580
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,316
It's time for us to die for our honor. The
Mughals have surrounded the entire Fort

581
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,799
They know that we do not
have enough food and arms with us

582
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,473
Guru Sahib has ordered that we will
go out of the Fort and fight them!

583
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,473
Fine with us!
We all go together attack

584
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,915
them head on. We will easily
kill at least hundreds of them

585
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,189
Not hundreds!

586
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,950
<i>We would stay thousands but
the way our Guru Father has commended</i>

587
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:52,230
We will go out in groups
of 5 to fight the Mughals

588
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:59,359
They would have never even imagined
how deathly we will be for them

589
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,997
1 would lead the first group. Any four
of you can get ready to come with me

590
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,151
We are ready!!

591
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,034
Easy, we need to take advantage
of the fog and reach the enemy

592
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,790
I think Singh's ars coming, go check,

593
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,349
I don't think so, you go.

594
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,000
You Idiots,
why are you fighting amongst yourselves.

595
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,671
Shut the roar of this Singh!

596
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,671
This was the hut ws ware told about

597
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,914
Anybody there?

598
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,556
Seems someone has been here

599
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,470
Yes. My Lord

600
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,636
Have you seen any family member of the
Guru of Anandpur or his Singhs ?

601
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,430
A while ago one of your
army units had come here

602
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,154
and they wers asking the same quastion

603
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,552
and I told them that I
have not seen any Singh's here

604
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,632
It might have been Bashir Khan's unit

605
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,957
Come! Then lets take
the shorter way along the river

606
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,917
We will get to them faster

607
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,513
The shorter way...

608
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,152
Hey Almighty, protect them.

609
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,075
Mata Ji you should
rest here for a while.

610
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,710
Fateh Singh?

611
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,594
What is troubling you Fateh Singh 7

612
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,670
Grandma, I am missing my Mother

613
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,993
Even I am missing her

614
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,436
Not Guru Mother will be with both our

615
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,354
brothers and Guru Father
too right Grandma?

616
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,957
Yes my child hopefully

617
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,159
Grandma, she too would be missing us.

618
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,153
What happened my Lady?

619
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,517
Don't you warry my Lady,

620
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,235
I am sure they are safe and sound.

621
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,159
They four cannot
live without each other

622
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,398
Hey Almighty, please protect them

623
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,518
Bhai Daya Singh,

624
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,631
Three units have gone
out of the Fort to fight

625
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,950
I will take the next unit with me,

626
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,596
after my prayers I will go and take
Guru Father's blessing and be back here!

627
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,993
Please wait Ajit Singh Ji

628
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,191
You cannot step into this war

629
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,033
And why can't I do that?

630
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,949
It will be a great loss for
all of us if you go to this battle

631
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,198
Do not see me apart from
the other Singhs Bahi Daya Singh

632
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,550
Our clan does not acknowledge
any such relations

633
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,035
I know my Guru Father too well

634
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,677
He would open the gates of this
Fort himself to send me to the battle

635
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,598
He will not listen to any one of
Us, only Guru Sahib can stop him now

636
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,238
Hold your hearts from pain

637
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,991
And hide your tears,

638
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:13,358
Hear the story of Gujri's grand children

639
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,918
Fought the tyrants

640
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,677
They came to protect us

641
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,909
Came to enlighten our souls

642
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,915
The sons of the Lord

643
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,632
The sword Is heavy

644
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:38,120
Yes , that's why I am going to carry
Guru Father's smaller sword to battle.

645
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,631
The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's

646
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,635
<i>“The Four Princes, the Four Prince's</i>

647
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,991
<i>“The Four Princes, the Four Prince's</i>

648
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,799
Guru Sahib,
we had put forth plea before you,

649
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,674
but you haven't replied to us as yet.

650
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,036
Guru Father,
1 am ready to go to battle

651
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,429
Ajit Singh you cannot.

652
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,956
My name is Ajit,
will let no one win over me,

653
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,995
but if someone does,
it'll be only when I am no more!

654
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,432
Bless me Guru Father.

655
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,675
By sending Ajit Singh to battle.
Guru Gobind Singh let

656
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,120
everyone know that he kept no difference
between his Singh's and his sons.

657
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,109
They were all the sons of
the Khalsa and when the need arose,

658
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,794
they could fight unto death!

659
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,876
O Lord grant me this boon, this gift

660
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,680
that nothing can deter
me from doing good deeds

661
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,639
I should have no fear of the
enemy when I fight in the battlefield

662
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,798
I should have this faith
that the victory is mine

663
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,354
Attack!

664
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,154
Move ahead!

665
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,789
Surround him.

666
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,075
Soldiers shoot the arrows!

667
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:09,354
The wartior Ajit Singh fought
with exemplary valour

668
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,795
He then stood looking

669
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,316
At his brother in the Mud Fort

670
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,632
Who, He knew was in a hurry too

671
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,516
So Showed the right path

672
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,995
Waheguru !

673
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,313
To his own young brother
To attain martyrdom...

Dear

679
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,471
Listen...

680
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,751
Buy whatever you need
for the house with this.

681
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,878
If you need any more
money you can ask me for it

682
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,553
Hold onto that

683
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,957
Mata Ji all we have
here is yours only

684
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,636
Don't take this trouble, please.
Be comfortable, I'll prepare some food

685
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:43,473
Guru Sahib, the events at the Sirsa
river were very unfortunate.

686
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,317
Mata Ji and the little ones are no
where to be found Ajit Singh has been martyred.

687
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,036
And yet you are so calm and composed.

688
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,916
People in this world struggle
to find ways to survive

689
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,269
and your inspiration

690
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,397
encourages Singhs to brace
martyrdom while fighting injustice,

691
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:04,909
All hopes are now on Jujhar Singh, to
lead the Khalsa with utmost brilliance.

692
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,436
Guru Father, I too want
to go to battle like my brother

693
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,273
No! Jughar No!

694
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:17,476
Do not say that. You are too young to go
to battle. Guru Sahib, you must not allow

695
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,031
this. I will ask Seva
Singh to lead the next unit

696
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,234
Bhai Daya Singh, I might not know
all the traits of sword fighting vet

697
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,957
but I can easily slay a handful
of 8-10 men before I fall!

698
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:32,936
Guru Father I need your blessings.

699
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,554
Guru Father I need your blessings.

700
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,114
Then his own father

701
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,472
Armoured his son

702
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,310
Pracious treasure of his own

703
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,033
He let go

704
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,594
He who says so is blessed..

705
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,515
"Truth Is God”

706
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,637
'What are you thinking Guru Mother?'

707
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:16,513
'My Son, when in full
armour with a sword in hand'

708
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,718
<i>'would you lock as gracious..'</i>

709
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,996
'..as your sider brother?'

710
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,920
'I would obviously take your
blessings before I go to war,'

711
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,992
'so you can then see
for yourself how I look'

712
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,796
Guru Mother.. you've come here?

713
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,360
Yes, I wanted to see you before
you step into the battlefield

714
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,918
While I was taking the blessing
from Guru Father, I was hoping

715
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,113
that my Guru Mother
would also be with me,

716
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,596
so that I could take her
blessings too before I go to battle

717
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,673
I hope you aren't scared

718
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,879
Scared? I think I am going
to scare the Mughals today

719
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:09,038
I am proud of you today. My son is going
to step into the battiefield as a soldier

720
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,319
Guru Mother, I sees tears In your eyes

721
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,030
They are not tears,
they are my blessings

722
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,876
As He commands, so they exist.

723
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,517
O Nanak, True is the
Creation of the True Lord.

724
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,039
Attack!

725
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,949
Move forward!

726
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,360
This is the Guru's second son

727
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,833
Come let's play 'Gatka'.

728
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,274
You are still just a kid you fool and
you have come to fight us knights ?

729
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,911
I have Killed many already,
will take down at least 20 more

730
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,029
10

731
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,269
15

732
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,717
19

733
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,711
O you son of the Guru

734
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,236
So that's it?
you said you would kill 20?!

735
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,710
Bole so Nihaal

736
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,789
Sat Sri Akaal

737
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,876
Guru Gobind then saw his own sons

738
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,918
martyred In the battiefleld

739
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:29,552
He then recalled
the words Of Gurbani

740
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,751
Nothing Is mine within myself

741
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,477
Whatever there is, is Yours, O Lord

742
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,276
<i>If I surrender to You what is
already Yours,</i>

743
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,513
What does It cost me?

744
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,838
His Sons have sacrificad for a cause,

745
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,757
He is thankful to the Lord for this.

746
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,792
It was the Lord who blessed him with them

747
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,910
He has let them be so for Lords own call.

748
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,637
The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's

749
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,317
The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's

750
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,833
Gangu

751
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,469
Gangu

752
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,150
Gangu

753
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,478
Mata Ji, I think someone
has stolen your bag of mohurs

754
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:41,030
Not a problem Gangu, maybe
his need is more than mine

755
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,559
But that bag had all your valuables

756
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,274
Oh no my child,
My valuables are right here with me

757
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,552
But I think , I will go and
lodge a complaint with the kotwal

758
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,478
No need, my dear

759
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,354
In fact, nowadays the people in kotwall's
are bigger thieves than burglars

760
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,958
As you wish mata ji

761
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,878
If the authority turns up.
they will take away my valuables.

762
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,952
What the Singhs said is true,

763
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,431
a clenched fist is more
powerful than an open palm

764
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,273
The Guru definitely
has some divine power in him

765
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,556
There is no such
thing as divine power.

766
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,918
Wars are won with courage.

767
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,234
Ask Wazir Khan to send
his sons to a battlefield!

768
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,474
There is no movement
in the Mughal Amy. My Lord

769
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,399
Guru Sahib has decided that he too
will step onto the battlefield tomorrow.

770
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,875
No Sangat Singh, we
cannot let this happen

771
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,715
We have to stop him
from doing so at any cost

772
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,954
Bhai Daya Singh,

773
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,317
Guru Sahib first baptized the Five
Singhs and established the Khalsa?

774
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,151
Right!

775
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,311
So that means The Five
chosen ones represent the Khalsa?

776
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,913
And the Khalsa represents them?

777
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,990
Of course

778
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,636
That's great! So we should
go to Guru Sahib and tell him

779
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,555
that if you are there
the Khalsa clan will be,

780
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,712
and for us Singhs the
Khalsa clan is everything

781
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,758
Khalsa is Guru and
the Guru is Khalsa for us

782
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:37,719
Guru Sahib when you baptized
The Chosen Five, you gave

783
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,711
them the authority,

784
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,155
that if and when the need arises for
a decision in matter of the panth,

785
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,830
the decision of The
Chosen Five will be supreme.

786
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,915
So we, The Chose Five, keeping
in mind your democratic principles.

787
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:59,798
in the supreme interest of
the panth ask you leave the Mud Fort

788
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,870
<i>Waheguru Ji ka Khalsa
Waheguru Ji ki Fateh.</i>

789
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,876
That night Guru Gokind
made one of his Singhs

790
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,716
wear his clothes and he himself dressed
in a common man's attire left the Fort.

791
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,473
With him were Bhai Daya Singh, bhai
Dharam Singh and Bhal Maan Singh

792
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,153
But before leaving,

793
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:40,030
he announced his departure,
clapped aloud thrice and said,

794
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,554
"Pir of Hind is leaving,
stop him if you have the courage to”

795
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,909
After Hearing these words,
the Mughals were flustered

796
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,274
Who is It? Who Is there?

797
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,397
Did you hear it?

798
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,036
Oh, I can't see anything.
I cant even hear properly

799
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,157
<i>It was a dark night that day</i>

800
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,278
No one got to know what happened

801
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:10,434
I think I heard it clearly, I
will go tell the Commander about this!

802
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,953
The next day a fierce
battle took place in Chiamkour.

803
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,638
When the Singh who wore
the Guru's clothes was killed,

804
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,236
the Commander thought
he had killed the Guru himself.

805
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,592
Wazir Khan was dancing with joy.

806
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,519
You Fools!

807
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,399
This is not the Guru!
Its somebody else

808
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,514
Go and search for
him in the entire Fort

809
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,511
My lord! There is
no one else in the fort

810
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,116
except for the Guru's
blue horse and four Arab horses

811
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,719
This means that

812
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,509
he has again escaped quietly in
the night before we could catch him

813
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,629
Forgive me, My Lord.
But the Guru said aloud,

814
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,952
when he left I clearly
heard him saying

815
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,992
<i>"Pir of Hind is leaving,</i>

816
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,316
stop him if you have the courage to"

817
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,599
<i>I told the Commander
the moment. I heard it.</i>

818
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:07,556
Why didn't you come to me? Now
go and search him in the entire area!

819
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,634
I want him dead or alive!

820
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,595
I'll make him my slave and force
him to wear the Turkish turban.

821
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,836
Huh!!

822
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:22,478
Soldiers what are you waiting
For?? Kill the Guru's eagle

823
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,998
He has disrespected you.
we won't leave him

824
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,389
Him Huh!

825
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,269
Here you go children, your milk

826
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:52,193
Grandmother, has Gangu come back after
giving our message to brother Ajit singh?

827
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,156
You are just like your grandfather.
You never forget a thing.

828
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,271
Grandma, today I met Grandpa
in my dream

829
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,830
Your grandpa?

830
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,673
Yes, he lives in
Chandni Chowk in Delhi

831
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,639
He has made a huge
palace of his own there

832
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,434
Yes and the colour
of the palace is white.

833
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,551
Yes, yes. It's pure white colour

834
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,953
<i>Tell me something?</i>

835
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,112
How did you both see
exactly the same dream

836
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,634
Fateh Singh ls very naughty grandma,

837
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,314
he must have peeked
into my dream secretly...

838
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,914
But first, I told you about the dream.

839
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,674
He must have secretly
watched my dream

840
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,116
Then tell me, who else were there?

841
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,033
<i>Brother Ajit and Brother
Jujhar were there too</i>

842
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,952
He is correct grandma,

843
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,590
Brother Ajit and Brother
Jujhar stay in that palace

844
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,509
Brother Jujhar has
left the Gatka fight,

845
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,114
He now learns how
to fight with the sword

846
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,358
Yes Grandma, and Brother
Ajit told me

847
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,115
that some of the walls
of Sirhind are very old

848
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,154
even before Babur's time, so
we should play carefully over there

849
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,278
Maks sure that no wall falls on you

850
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,838
Don't say all this my child,
you should not speak such words

851
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,112
Hey Almighty! Protect us all

852
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:19,111
Hey Waheguru! Bless us

853
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,199
Sir , Guru Gobind Singh's mother

854
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,552
and his two youngest
sons are living at my place

855
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,678
Grandma and her children
are going to Sirhind

856
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:38,754
They will martyred there,
but are smiling all along

857
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,391
Even with a million men,
Wazir Khan could not catch the Guru.

858
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,278
And he thinks he has done a great job

859
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,273
by catching his mother and his two
kids and is showcasing them in public

860
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,113
Hey, Waheguru

861
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,430
The one who tortures the women and
children is a monster and not a warrior.

862
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,837
And he is making
us do this dirty job,

863
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,630
it would have been so much better had he
called us to find the Guru in Chamkour

864
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,433
Hey, where do you think you're going?

865
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,036
To the next village
to meet someone there

866
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,555
What is your name?

867
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,550
Bhaago,

868
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,154
it Bhaago

869
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,835
Have any of you seen
the Guru of Anandpur?

870
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,391
Yes, I see him day and
Night. I saw him just now

871
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:46,795
Where?

872
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,113
Close your eves and
you would also see him

873
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:55,229
Aye Sikhni!
Do you see this sword in my hand?

874
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:59,474
If you know something tell
Us! We have an order to arrest him

875
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:03,633
Start with smaller steps solder.
you can start leaping later!

876
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,279
What do u mean by that?

877
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,954
I challenge you to
try and catch me first?

878
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,111
Maybe then you can
think of catching my Guru!

879
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,469
Some of you left my
Guru behind when he needed

880
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,793
you the most. Go and
get inside your holes!

881
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,157
You filthy rats! We women
have given birth to a lot of lions

882
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,119
and we can ourselves take
up the job of fighting the enemy!

883
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:33,509
Bole So Nihaal Sat Shrl Akaal!

884
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,152
If you have any shame left, go and die

885
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,794
As you seem fit or else go back to
your loving Guru and ask for forgiveness

886
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,356
The forty of us have
made unforgivable mistake.

887
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,793
My Lord and Master Is forever new;

888
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,549
He's the Giver forever and aver.

889
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:58,999
My lady. please take us to the
ever so forgiving Guru we left behind

890
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:06,959
I will take you. I will make
you meet him when I close my eyes

891
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,035
and concentrate, I can
see my Guru In front of my eyes

892
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,517
We will meet him very soon

893
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,956
Grandma,
does no body know where our father is?

894
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,353
No, my child.

895
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,676
I don't have any answers
to my grandsons queries,

896
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,670
my son your mothers thought are
wandering where are you my Gobind.

897
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:50,960
Tell the beloved friend (the
Lord) the plight of his disciples.

898
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:13,116
Without You, rich blankets are a disease
and the comfort of the house is

899
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,831
like living with snakes.

900
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:22,399
<i>Like living with snakes.</i>

901
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:31,480
Tell the beloved friend
(the Lord) the plight of his disciples.

902
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,831
Our water pitchers are like stakes of torture
and our cups have edges like daggers.

903
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,751
Your neglect is like the suffering
of animals at the hands of butchers.

904
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,671
Your neglect is like the suffering
of animals at the hands of butchers.

905
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:09,400
Tell the beloved friend
(the Lord) the plight of his disciples.

906
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,674
Our Beloved Lord's straw
bed is more pleasing to us

907
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:48,271
Our Beloved Lord's straw
bed is more pleasing to us

908
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,390
than living in costly
furnace-like mansions.

909
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:58,033
Than living in costly
furnace-like mansions.

910
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:06,960
Tell the beloved friend
(the Lord) the plight of his disciples.

911
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:18,195
When all the three Singhs reached
Guru Sahib, they thanked the Lord.

912
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:24,616
When they saw his wounded feet and
his torn robe their smiles disappeared

913
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,277
When they saw his wounded feet and
his torn robe their smiles disappeared

914
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,960
Speak Mirza

915
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,798
My Lord! Where should we keep
the kids and mother of the Guru?

916
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,397
Do you think these are some royal guests
from Delhi, whom we would cater to?

917
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:41,394
Go and throw them into
the cold Burz we have!

918
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:45,474
Forgive me, My Lord. But
the cold Burzis a place

919
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,877
where the bravest and toughest of
men turn blue due to the freezing air!

920
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,680
I don't think you've heard,

921
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:55,829
the Singhs say that
they are hot blooded,

922
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,959
if that is the case then
they should not feel the cold there!

923
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:04,718
O' yes and they are the heirs of
'Hind da Peer'! They have everything

924
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,389
You show no mercy on them, give them

925
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,476
nothing at all. No bed to sleep,
no water, not even a piece of bread!

926
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:19,353
The wall is waiting,
the cold tower is calling

927
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:26,358
Grandma is hiding tears, bit seems helpless.

928
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:32,477
Grandmother, you being the mother
of our Guru Father. yet you look worried?

929
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,400
Look at us!

930
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,471
We are his children
and we do not fear anything

931
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,591
You have only taught us,

932
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,116
that whatever Waheguru does,
we should accept it with a smile.

933
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,795
Fatah Singh, come Ms
remind Grandma her own words!

934
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,832
Everything that the Almighty
does is good for us,

935
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,192
Nothing happens without his command.

936
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,392
If something unfortunate happens,
there is always some good behind it,

937
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,995
but we don't understand It,

938
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,870
and we tend to overlook it ,
hence, feel saddened.

939
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,998
If you remember each and every word
that I have taught you my little ones,

940
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:22,078
Then I shall never forget that you are
my son's children and I his mother

941
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,275
Sir Ji

942
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:27,876
Mirza,

943
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:33,593
I wanted a small favour from you and I
shall give you anything you wish for this

944
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,077
<i>If you're ready to
give anything Moti .</i>

945
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,589
then I am ready to listen
to anything that you say

946
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:45,598
Sir Mirza, I want to give some
milk to Guru's mother and his kids

947
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:50,391
Okay give me the 'real'
cream and you can take the milk

948
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,035
Okay

949
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,798
Hey Moti! Stop there, this cream will
not churn out any butter! Go back now!

950
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,356
My Lord, this is all that
I can offer today, tomorrow

951
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,080
I'll get all the jewelry of my wife

952
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:10,273
Better get your wife's jewelry,

953
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,150
but that would be counted in
today's account. What about tomorrow?

954
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,994
I will arrange for something

955
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,072
Get that jewelry
tomorrow for sure! Now go!

956
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:25,756
Oh Almighty! Thank you for letting
me serve Guru's mother and his kids

957
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:35,075
Mata Ji, I have got some milk for
you and the kids please accept Moti's

958
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,357
Small humble service

959
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:51,436
<i>Moti, I hope that by doing so you are not
Putfing yourself in some kind of danger</i>

960
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,672
O c'mon Maata Ji,

961
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:58,192
I am honored that I have
got the chance to serve you

962
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:41,310
You have to promise me that till you
are here you will let me serve you.

963
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,796
I take your leave.

964
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,200
Okay Motl!

965
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,715
Dear Son,

966
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,398
do you have any information
about my son Gobind?

967
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:58,031
What wouldn't He know,
he keeps information about everything,

968
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:02,473
How would a layman like me know his

969
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,712
Whereabouts. All I heard was a
fierce battle was fought in Chamkour

970
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:12,915
Who won, who lost, I've no news,

971
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,749
<i>Mata Ji, there is one.
thing I did not understand</i>

972
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,754
What is It?

973
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:29,920
On one hand,
'Wazir Khan's soldiers are hunting.

974
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:34,273
all over for Guru Sahib
to slay him to his death,

975
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:38,394
and on the other hand , two
Muslim brother's from the same area

976
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,632
felt honored by taking him
into their house and caring for him,

977
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,793
<i>Good souls for sure!</i>

978
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,119
There are many more such people

979
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,950
and many such believe
in Guru Sahib's teachings

980
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,475
Hundreds of them are in his army

981
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,749
and a lot of them
are even commanders too.

982
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,679
Guru Sahib is not against
any Muslim or Islam.

983
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:06,072
He only opposes the King and his men,

984
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:10,000
who are forcing people
to convert into their religion

985
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,038
and are looting the wealth
of those who stand up against them.

986
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:18,030
Guru Sahib's fight with Aurangzeb
and his Governor Wazir Khan,

987
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,834
is not a fight between
Sikhs and a Muslim

988
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:25,393
but instead is the fight between good
and evil, which will always be there.

989
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,314
By preaching about
good and evil you have

990
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,119
enlightened the souls
of 50 many Singh's.

991
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,750
The Khalsa will always
be grateful to you for this.

992
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:43,992
I am just an insignificant soldier of
my Guru, my focus is on his command,

993
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:49,315
He just has to instruct me and I will
pounce on the enemy like a lioness!

994
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:57,396
Khan Sahib, arresting old women and
children is against our principles.

995
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,549
Did they come to Sirhind
and rebel against you?

996
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,960
What sin have they comitted?

997
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:08,991
Their sin is that they are the mother
and children of Gobind, the rebel.

998
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:13,399
He has created chaos in
this province that I command

999
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:19,636
I have captured his family
so that I can barter his arrest.

1000
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,870
Be careful, let no harm
come to his family in any way!

1001
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,153
If any harm does come to them,

1002
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:31,114
then unfortunately we will be
forced to complain about you to Delhi

1003
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,436
Hmm...

1004
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,351
Kazi Sahib do something...

1005
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,591
But I haad some valid reason to do so...

1006
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:46,958
Their father is a rebel not
the children, so I can't issue their death

1007
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,429
warrant and hand it over to you

1008
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,399
But I cannot let this chance go.

1009
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:54,119
There is one way out,

1010
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:58,554
Where you won't need to get their warrant
and I wouldn' need to issue one.

1011
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,676
What did you say?

1012
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,073
And you will be able
take your revenge from Gobind!

1013
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,475
How is that?

1014
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:10,271
If we can make the children
agree to convert to our religion

1015
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:16,556
Yes, if his own children
accept our religion

1016
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:22,313
then this would be a
shameful defeat for the Guru

1017
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,719
But why can't I go along with the kids...

1018
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,593
Don't be stubborn old lady!

1019
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:31,838
1 am only doing what I am ordered to do.

1020
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:36,393
<i>Come on now! What are you waiting
For? Teke the kids with you! Move!</i>

1021
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,839
My Lord, it has been planned
Just the way you wanted.

1022
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:55,080
It will all happen, as you wished.

1023
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:59,474
I have closed the big
gate and opened the smaller one.

1024
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,157
The soldiers are getting
the children here, our

1025
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,636
soldiers will bow their
heads in order to enter,

1026
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,193
the children would see
them and follow suit. The children

1027
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:25,112
of the Guru of Sikh's shall bow down
to the great and mighty Nawab Wazlr Khan

1028
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,070
Waheguru Ji ka Khalsa.
Waheguru Ji ki Fatah.

1029
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,553
What did the children say?

1030
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,916
Everyone salutes the
Lord with a 'salaam' here

1031
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,435
These kids have made
a terrible mistake!

1032
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,117
This is the court of The
Governor of Sirhind, Wazir khan,

1033
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:31,838
no one can come here and
speak in praise of any Guru.

1034
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:39,191
Come on, little ones
apologise to the Nawab,

1035
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,439
bow your heads and salute him.

1036
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,590
We believe In the Almighty God,

1037
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:52,595
we only bow down to His Greatness He who
lives inside all of us, apart from Him,

1038
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:56,390
we do not bow down to anybody!

1039
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,711
You Kaflr, non-believer!

1040
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,679
Kafir is the one who forces
others to change their religion

1041
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:07,156
Kafir is the one who
misuses his power to do wrong

1042
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,239
The one who is honest
is a real muslim

1043
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,951
One who is cunning,
a cheater Is a Kafir!

1044
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,556
You have smartly and indirectly
termed us as cheaters!

1045
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,277
You will now teach
us about our own religion?

1046
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:24,279
We only know of our
Sikh refigion Kazi Sahib

1047
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,995
and It does not believe In any slavery.

1048
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:30,039
This is what our Guru
Father has taught us!

1049
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,597
Children, I have sent
hundreds of soldiers

1050
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:37,316
in all directions
to capture your father

1051
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:40,473
Just as the rays of
the Sun cannot be captured.

1052
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,754
There is not one born
yet, who can capture our father!

1053
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,714
He has such a radiance
around him that everyone

1054
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,395
who looks upon him bows n salutes him,

1055
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,636
the day you will
be face to face with Him

1056
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:02,552
You would also do the same.

1057
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,192
What happened Khan Sahib?

1058
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,276
Seems like you just
experienced our Guru Father

1059
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,800
Quiet!!

1060
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,275
That's not fair!
He

1061
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,232
not worthy of being the Governer

1062
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,358
Children, you should stay with us now

1063
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,758
I promise that you wil get
everything you want,

1064
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,589
and where would you go now?
Maybe you don' know,

1065
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,353
but Anandpur is in ruins

1066
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,590
and we would soon
be arresting your Father,

1067
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:54,358
your elder brother's Ajit and Jujhar have
been killed in the Battle of Chamkour

1068
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:59,873
How can we believe you, your intentions
seem very foul to us Khan Sahib

1069
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,357
We have committed no crime.
yet you have us in your custody

1070
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:07,718
Khan Sahib has advised correctly
you should accept his religion,

1071
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,198
or else you too will
die like your brothers.

1072
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,159
The first thing we
are taught In our religion

1073
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,470
is to overcome the fear of
death, so you cannot scare us with it!

1074
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:21,390
O, Dear children! Talk
about life and not death.

1075
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,400
We would give you everything you

1076
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,951
ever wanted. We would give
you a gorgeous palace to live in,

1077
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:31,874
you would have all the
luxuries that a Prince would have,

1078
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,232
if I am forgetting
something you can remind me?

1079
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,438
<i>Sure I will</i>

1080
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,359
I will ramind you

1081
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,479
<i>what my late Grandfather
Guru Teg Bahadur had said once</i>

1082
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,318
to the Kashmiri Pundit's

1083
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,555
who were also being forced
to convert their religion.

1084
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:54,994
My grandfather said tell

1085
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:58,311
those ruthless rulers,
make the Guru convert his religion

1086
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,073
first and if he agrees

1087
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,198
then you all would also convert
into their religion willingly.

1088
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:05,118
Yes, I remember!

1089
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,230
Yes, so what?

1090
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,758
So whose Grandfather, gave his own
life to save someone else's religion,

1091
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:14,799
you are asking his grandchildren
to convert to your religion?

1092
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,638
Think again!

1093
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,879
Maybe you are making
a mistake somewhere!

1094
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,754
Your Grandfather's widow, I
mean your Grandmother is still alive.

1095
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,595
I think it's best that you
go and discuss this with her,

1096
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,070
You have time until tomorrow!

1097
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:38,480
<i>Waheguru Ji ka Khalsa <br />Waheguru Ji ki Fateh</i>

1098
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,999
The kids dumbfounded evearyones here

1099
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,557
These are no nomal kids

1100
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,954
The one who helped capture
the enemy's family - Gangu,

1101
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:08,159
come over to collect
your Royal Reward.

1102
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:12,350
Her eyes are tired waiting

1103
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:15,910
A Mother's heart yearns...

1104
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:19,795
Grandma has It the tower

1105
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:23,191
with two wonderful souls

1106
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:27,110
The wicked tried their best

1107
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:30,752
But her children held ground

1108
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:35,029
The lights of this tower

1109
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:40,399
enlightened all around

1110
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:45,112
The Four Prince's...

1111
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,696
These are no nomal kids

1112
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,312
These are no nomal kids

1113
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,312
1 don't think they
are going to accept

1114
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,960
<i>I will make them accept it!</i>

1115
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:56,034
Khan Sahib,
do not forget you have to seek

1116
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:58,953
the approval of The Council before
you take any action against them.

1117
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,754
Khan Sahib, do
appreciate my brain wave

1118
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,233
Call for the Nawab of
Malerkotla to The Court tomorrow,

1119
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:24,277
he had lost his brother Khajar Khan
in the battle with the Singhs in Ropar

1120
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:31,910
and his second brother Nihar Khan was
killed by the Guru himself in Charmkour.

1121
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:40,751
Why didn't I think of this earlier? He
will be more than happy to do this task!

1122
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,436
Dear, have you put the milk in the
container for Mata Ji and the children?

1123
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:52,430
Slightly thickening the milk today,
I have put some dates and cardamom in it too.

1124
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,479
Have you picked the jewelry
from the ledge? What happened?

1125
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,154
Why are you quite?

1126
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:05,076
Mirza will account this
Jewelry for yesterday's bribe.

1127
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:06,640
What do I give him today?

1128
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,958
You can give him this houss,

1129
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,758
we can go to a Temple and stay there!

1130
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:19,278
But for God's sake make sure there
isn't any hitch in this service of milk,

1131
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:27,792
My child, Moti, seeing your affection
towards the children, I would pray to God

1132
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:31,829
that he truly rewards
you for this service of yours

1133
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,919
O Mata Ji,

1134
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,277
It's your blessing and wishes that I
need, they will go with me a long way,

1135
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,434
There is nothing else one
takes to heaven, I take your leave

1136
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,671
- God bless you
- Thank you

1137
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,718
So children,

1138
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:53,234
you never told me what exactly
happened at the court today?

1139
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,994
Nothing much Grandma

1140
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:59,074
We ofourse remember the sacrifice our
Grandfather made but they had forgotten it,

1141
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,151
so we reminded them of It.

1142
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:04,835
Grandma they were scaring us,
thinking we are little kids!

1143
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,470
They asked us to choose:
death or their religion

1144
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:12,116
To scare us even further, they
even said that both our brothers

1145
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,352
have been killed in
the battle at Chamkour

1146
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,470
'A fierce battle
was fought in Chamkour'

1147
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,872
'who won, who lost, I've no news.'

1148
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,954
Grandma?

1149
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:35,077
My children. You are right,

1150
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:42,397
they were just blabbering, pay no heed
to it. We will be meeting them soon.

1151
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:53,634
Today, we have Nawab Malerkotla Janab -
'Sher Mohammad Khan present in The Court!

1152
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,792
Not just ons, but two of his brothers

1153
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,232
were brutally killed by
Guru Gobkind Singh, their father.

1154
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,954
Do you know why your father
brutally Killed Nawab's brothers?

1155
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,510
They must have made a mistake,

1156
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,598
his brothers!

1157
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,477
You little brats, you have no manners!

1158
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:32,952
You, are a powerful Governer,
yet you are shamelessly cunning and mean

1159
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:35,674
Rudeness can be punished with death

1160
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,633
Death is acceptable!
But we wouldn't cow down!

1161
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,791
Don't you fear death?

1162
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,031
Don't you fear God?

1163
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,316
Watch what you say, fearlessly

1164
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:48,392
Yes, fearless we live, fearless

1165
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,710
we die because we are the Guru's Singhs

1166
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,677
Hmmmm Singh?

1167
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,992
Yes, the one who does
what is right is a Singh!

1168
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:59,954
The one who takes away sadness and
brings happiness to others is a Singh!

1169
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,913
The one who becomes the
strength of the weak is 2 Singh

1170
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,552
The one who is ready to sacrifice
his life fighting for justice is a Singh!

1171
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:10,714
O'you Singhs! His brother's
were also fighting for justice,

1172
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,997
when your father killed
them in the battlefeild

1173
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,115
In the battle right?

1174
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,113
That isn't getting killed,
It's known as sacrifice!

1175
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:24,150
And by not calling it so, you are insulting
the sculs of the martyrs you speak of

1176
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:29,235
Manipulation of words and phrases is not
going to cover up your fathers crimes.

1177
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,273
You will be punished for his deeds,

1178
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:38,390
which shall be decided by Nawab
Malerkotla on whose mercy you are now

1179
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,038
Let the court know Naswal Sahib, what
punishment would you want to give

1180
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,273
to your culprits?!

1181
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,519
I want to take revenge from
Gobind for killing my brothers,

1182
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,518
and that I shall definitely do,

1183
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:09,993
but in the battlefield!
They are not my culprits

1184
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,478
Revenge is never taken
on women and children.

1185
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:21,558
In fact, I have a request, we should
free the mother and kids of Gobind

1186
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:39,110
Nawab Sahib today you have proved that
an honest man is a Muslim In Its true sense

1187
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,674
1100 believe in justice
my friends. As requested by the Nawab

1188
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:53,950
and sensing the will of
the pubic, I would free them both.

1189
01:48:55,840 --> 01:49:00,630
But I want to ask them one thing.
what will they do once they are freed?

1190
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,753
We would do the same thing
what our Guru Father Is doing.

1191
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,958
2nd what the next generations
of Singhs would do

1192
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,150
What is that?

1193
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:11,676
We would fight cruelty
and injustice to our last breath

1194
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:12,671
How?

1195
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:17,357
We would re-group all the Singhs of
our Guru Father and build an army again

1196
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:21,316
Did you hear? Did you all hear this?

1197
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:23,119
Their rebellious plan?

1198
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:28,593
They want to do the same thing what
their rebel father is doing against us.

1199
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:35,036
So now tell me, wise members
of The Council! Sitting here,

1200
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:40,314
what do you have to say for these children
who are eager to rebel against our Empire?

1201
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,400
Khan Sahib, I think everyone
has to say just one thing now!

1202
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,071
Son's of a snake will always be a snake!

1203
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,959
Suchanand, hold your tongue there!

1204
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:55,239
He is a friend of the
weak known for his noble deeds.

1205
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:59,951
Bow down In respect to
Him! Guru Gobind Singh is his name!

1206
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,276
You are lucky that we are your prisoners,

1207
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:09,469
otherwise I swear by Almighty your
body would have lost its head by now

1208
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,473
That's it! I do not
want to listen anymore!

1209
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:17,277
Children of the rebellious
Gobind, accept our religion now!!

1210
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,478
Or be ready for a brutal execution!

1211
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,678
First, accept death,
and give up any hope of life.

1212
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,310
Become the dust of the feet of all
and then, you may come to me.

1213
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:31,392
Kazi Sahib. the sentence

1214
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:34,200
The sentence- fatwa is ready, My Lord

1215
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:52,669
Crush It fast! Where are you going old lady

1216
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,470
Bury them alive in a wall

1217
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,073
Oh God! Save the Empire,
from the events that would follow

1218
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,709
Mata Ji! This is it!
You can't go further! Come with us

1219
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:31,358
The Kazi has issued a warrant, tomorrow both
the kids will be buried in the wall alive...

1220
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,275
But the kids are totally
calm and composed

1221
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:37,432
Maybe they did not
understand the sentence

1222
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:40,359
This is yet another
new way to Kill a prisoner

1223
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,119
Did you hear?

1224
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,073
Yes, yes, the kids have
been tricked into this

1225
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:48,358
<i>My friend this is a sin,
it's a mistake</i>

1226
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,237
God will never forgive them for this!

1227
01:51:55,120 --> 01:52:00,399
<i>Nawab Sahib, no worker is ready
to bury the kids into the wall tomorrow...</i>

1228
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:07,154
But there are two fellows in
our prison, Shashan Beg and Bashan Beg.

1229
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:14,199
Who are willing to do so
only if we free them from the prison, afterwards

1230
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:20,433
Go tell them, They shall be free!

1231
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,633
Surely My Lord! I would surely do that

1232
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,559
Grandma,

1233
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:39,512
<i>we did all our prayers, Moti also
came and gave us our milk for the day.</i>

1234
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,037
but you never asked what
happened at The Court today?

1235
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:47,394
Children, unjust allegations and
unfair questions

1236
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,674
Whatever happened today
we are very happy about it

1237
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:55,237
You are happy?
What is it that makes you happy?

1238
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:58,916
We are happy that we
have not let you down Grandma

1239
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:04,633
We are happy that we have kept the dignity
that our Father and Grandfather have

1240
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:09,438
We are happy that we did not
change our religion under the pressure

1241
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,839
of those monsters, we remembered
'what you have taught us

1242
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,077
I am vary proud of you

1243
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:23,036
The sentence issued by Kazi says
we would be buried alive in the wall tomorrow

1244
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:29,480
So what, you will only be buried
alive in the wall, not Kill you

1245
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,919
<i>Yes grandma, that wont Kill us</i>

1246
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:47,071
We too have children, I don't
want that after the execution tomorrow

1247
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:51,957
the father of my children should
be called as the murderer of the innocent

1248
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:56,039
'You want me to show
mercy for his children?

1249
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,477
The one who has mads our lives miserable

1250
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,038
1 cannot do anything,
Kazi has issued the sentence

1251
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,194
The sentence can be changed.
I am aware of that

1252
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,678
and how it can be changed,
you are very well aware of that

1253
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,478
Behave yourself Begum!!

1254
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:16,839
I'm not going to show
any mercy on his children

1255
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,918
I would not want that
the whole of the Mughal Empire

1256
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,436
calls me a coward, who is
scared of the Sikh Guru

1257
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:28,391
The sentence is done and
over with, nothing can be done now!

1258
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:32,358
For God's sake! Stop this madness My Lord,

1259
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,912
this is being cruel, It's a mistake

1260
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,476
Oh God! Forgive us

1261
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:51,990
O Mata! Get the children ready
soon, we will back to take them!

1262
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,753
The sentance has to be executed

1263
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:12,713
It's time to leave you Grandma,

1264
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,993
We will not be coming back this time

1265

How do we tell you what's going to happen

1266
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:35,551
<i>We can't see you crying...</i>

1267
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:40,798
I've separated from my son,
you are leaving too

1268
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,638
The tyrants are taking you away

1269

<i>We can't see you crying...</i>

01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:26,756
I will never see these beautiful souls again,

1276
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:31,511
I will never carass these pretty faces again

1277
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:36,436
Come let m dress you with plumas on your heads

1278

O Grandmal Why are worrying for us...

We are doing exactly what you taught us

By sacrificing ourselves and thinking of
our Lord

1287

lives children? You still have a choice

Yes, you still have a chance
Kazi Sahib cancel the sentence

Huh! What surprises talking about?

You think there will be
palaces built here after you die?

Images Of The Undying,

Chant And Meditate:

True In The Primal Beginning
True Throughout The Ages.

1311

Union with Him, and separation
from Him, come by His Will

1312
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:57,956
We come to receive what
is written in our destiny.

1313
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,389
<i>I bow to Him, I humbly bow.</i>

1314
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:03,553
“The Primal One, the Pure Light,
without beginning, without end.

1315
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:06,393
Throughout all the ages,
He is One and the Same,

1316
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:09,270
“The One Divine Mother conceived and
gave birth to the three deities.

1317
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:12,990
Brother, even though you came
into this world before me

1318
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:16,391
'l'll be meeting our Grandfather before you

1319
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:21,111
He makes things happen according to the Pleasure
of His Will. Such is His Celestial Order.

1320
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:30,036
Air is the Guru, Water is the Father,
and Earth is the Great Mother of all

1321
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:34,518
Day and night are the two nurses,
in whose lap all the world is at play.

1322
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,996
Think, there is a lot
that can happen even now.

1323
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:42,069
Good deeds and bad deeds-the record
is read out in the Presence of the Lord of Dharma,

1324
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:46,916
According to their own actions, some are drawn
closer, and some are driven farther away.

1325
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,395
Those who have meditated on the Naam,

1326
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:51,949
the Name of the Lord, and departed after
having worked by the sweat of their brows

1327
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:54,555
O Nanak, their faces are radiant
in the Court of the Lord,

1328
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:56,790
<i>'and many are saved along with them!</i>

1329
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:12,559
<i>Bole so nihaal... Sat Sri Akaal...</i>

1330
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,236
Pull these two out of the rubble.

1331
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:00,474
These two are still alive Khan Sahib.

1332
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,631
<i>This ls wrong. Mercy.</i>

1333
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:44,239
We have laid our lives
to save those of others

1334
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:49,840
We have laid the foundation for
the Khalsa to carry on the fight for justice.
