<i>Long time, no see.</i>

9
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,499
<i>Um, I've called you a few times.</i>

10
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:08,834
<i>You're a hard man to get
in contact with, these days.</i>

11
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,371
<i>Uh, do me a favor.
Call me when you get this.</i>

12
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:14,540
<i>Thanks.</i>

13
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,893
What are you doin' here?

14
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,894
Your dad's
started calling me now.

15
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:37,629
Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,231
Make him stop.
I'm goin' to work.

17
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,365
What?

18
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,278
What year was that?

19
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,814
- '97. Yeah.
- Very good.

20
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:56,715
We've been comin' here
a long time.

21
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:58,316
- Hey.
- Oh, Robert.

22
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:00,485
- Hey, Sampson. How you doin'?
- Good seeing you.

23
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,421
- Hey. Good seeing you.
- You look good.

24
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:04,689
Oh, thank you. Hey.

25
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,558
Hey. Everything good?

26
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:07,659
Yeah. It's great.

27
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:08,927
Good.

28
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,630
You, uh,

29
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,533
thought about my offer?

30
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,637
Dad, I'm not gonna go
work for my parents.

31
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,304
I'm pickin' up jobs.

32
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:20,506
It's goin' all right.

33
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:21,640
You know,
it's just the beginning.

34
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,510
Okay.
Wouldn't have thought

35
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:28,181
photography
could pay the rent, but.

36
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:34,653
So, what's up?

37
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,522
Why all the messages?

38
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,957
Why don't we order, first?

39
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,426
Dad, what's going on?

40
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:47,766
Your mother is in Cabo.

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,602
You had an affair?

42
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,236
Again?

43
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,538
Jesus!

44
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,705
You know, midlife is

45
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,341
a very difficult time, Robert.

46
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:56,542
- Is it?
- Yeah. It is.

47
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:57,976
- Mm.
- And why can't you have

48
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,377
a civil conversation
about life, here?

49
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:02,515
So this is about me?

50
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:06,519
Robert, come on.
Hey, Robert, what are you doing?

51
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,687
Come on! Robert!

52
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,456
Robert, your father's habit

53
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,860
of having sex with girls half
of his age is getting old,

54
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,362
so, I'm gonna take off
for a while.

55
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:19,364
I'll be back in time
for your opening.

56
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:21,533
If you need money, take the job.

57
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:26,271
¶ Unh ¶

58
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,473
¶ unh ¶

59
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:38,817
You ready?

60
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,287
All right.

61
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,388
Hair's looking fine.
Thank you.

62
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,395
That's it.

63
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:54,900
What's up, dude?

64
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,568
- This is my friend, Robert.
- Hey.

65
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:00,905
Hey.

66
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,641
Oh, cool.

67
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:06,012
I know.

68
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,817
Time for the picture.
Oh, okay.

69
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,318
Nice one.

70
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,533
Ah!

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,737
Hey, Marc.

72
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,105
Morning, Roberto.

73
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,043
Pretty early for you, bud.

74
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,878
- A little bit.
- Uh-huh.

75
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,013
So?

76
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,447
So?

77
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,951
What do you say, $500?

78
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,151
In your dreams.

79
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,855
I could probably swing $75.

80
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,457
7...? The frame
is worth more than $75.

81
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,964
$150. Ahem.

82
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:07,766
Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,771
Cups of coffee.

84
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:12,971
And I'm counting, this time.

85
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:16,975
All right.
Thank you.

86
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,076
- Deal?
- Deal.

87
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,879
All right.

88
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,046
Can I get two cups to go?

89
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,916
One with extra cream.

90
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,853
Put cream in the coffee,
you ruin the notes.

91
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,581
Agh. That's too much cream.

92
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:01,754
You gotta stay positive,
man, you know?

93
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,555
You're just about to blossom.

94
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,891
I feel it.

95
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:07,793
I might need one of my photos
back from you

96
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,862
to make rent this month.

97
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,464
Yeah, man.
Whatever you need. Hmm?

98
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,504
Well, I'm gonna go to work.

99
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:23,776
Call me if you have the urge
to, you know, end it.

100
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,990
Look at this hair.

101
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,127
Beautiful.

102
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,730
- It's fantastic. - Fantastic.
- Thank you

103
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:45,897
Who is here?

104
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,968
- Aaah!
- Oh, man. Yeah.

105
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,136
Oh, that stinks.

106
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,906
That's very...
I think you win.

107
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,841
- Robert. Attendance.
- I think you're...

108
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:57,009
- All right.
- All right, everybody,

109
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,077
please be neat.
Push in your seat

110
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,612
- and head over to the mat, okay?
- You can take that over there.

111
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,146
- It's time for attendance.
- Can I take this?

112
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,816
You can take those with you,
if you want.

113
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,183
Just bring 'em over there.
Let's do this.

114
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:07,019
After we do attendance
and reading, okay?

115
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,289
All right.
Let's start with Raymond.

116
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,591
Where are...?
Oh, there you are, Raymond.

117
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,826
- And then we we have Amanda.
- Alison.

118
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,262
Amanda. All right,

119
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,198
you gonna keep that
cash register with you?

120
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,065
Okay. So do...

121
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:23,601
Come over here for attendance.
Time for attendance.

122
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,771
You know what? I'll take over.
You go. Yeah. Thank you.

123
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:28,072
What is this?

124
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:31,043
This is for you.
All right?

125
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,177
She didn't paint it.
It was with her stamp.

126
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,980
I like it. I like the...

127
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,250
All right, you guys.

128
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,224
Why'd you put her in my class?

129
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,259
It's Alison's class,
not yours.

130
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,562
Why did you put her
in my class?

131
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,231
My dojo, my rules.

132
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:54,766
I thought
this wasn't gonna happen.

133
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,100
I thought th-this woman...

134
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,702
Sara Walsh.
You know her name.

135
00:08:57,735 --> 00:08:59,871
Yeah. Sara Whatever.
She disappears years ago.

136
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,673
She's back now.
You're gonna float her?

137
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,875
It's a little more complicated
than that, Robert.

138
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:07,846
You don't even know
that she's your kid.

139
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,581
I'm 90% sure.

140
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,250
We're gonna go to a paternity
test to be 100% sure.

141
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:14,253
Great. So, when you're
100% sure, then what?

142
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:15,653
We try to work it out, Robert.

143
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,858
<i>- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?</i>

144
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,594
I am tryin' to work here.

145
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,096
What the hell are you doin'?

146
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:25,331
Hey, Mom.

147
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,798
What are you doing
in my office?

148
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,266
Seriously?

149
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,702
You need to get back here
before Dad ruins my life.

150
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:33,672
- Harry, stop hiding.
- I'm not hiding, dear.

151
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,908
Right.
So how's Mason adjusting?

152
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,711
You knew about this?

153
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,846
Robert, I have to support
your father.

154
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,715
This is a very difficult
time for all of us.

155
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,283
- Thank you, Miriam.
- If we're being supportive,

156
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:46,619
all of a sudden,
then why aren't you here?

157
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,388
Because your father's a prick.

158
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,990
Thanks, Miriam.

159
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,658
So, have you met
the mother yet?

160
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,894
No! No.
I'm not going to.

161
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,396
Why don't you just say
hello to her after school?

162
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,197
She could be the mother
of your sister, Robert.

163
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,134
- Half-sister.
- All right. Half-sister. Okay.

164
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,104
So, you gotta meet her.

165
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,270
I quit.

166
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:08,173
I'm serious.

167
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:09,841
You hear that?
It's good, right?

168
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,244
Yeah. What do you plan to do
to make money there,

169
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,314
Mapplethorpe? Hmm?

170
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,919
All right, honey.
I think that's it.

171
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:23,121
Come home soon.

172
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,290
I hate this.
Buh-bye.

173
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,698
Robert.

174
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,516
- We're gonna be 20 minutes late.
- Is this a setup?

175
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:39,871
No. It's not all about you,
Mr. Narcissist, okay?

176
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,374
This is about me inviting you
to a work friend's dinner party

177
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:45,009
because, I don't know,
you had a bad day.

178
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,711
<i>So, then, it is about me.</i>

179
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,182
Touché.

180
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:55,220
You didn't hear it?
It was tremendously loud.

181
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:59,090
Some nice notes.

182
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:01,360
Lenny, how long do you
cook that bird for?

183
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,897
You know like 45 minutes, 350°,
but then, the last 5 minutes,

184
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,298
you just blast it
in the broiler.

185
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:09,367
Golden-brown on top.

186
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,335
- It looks amazing.
- Thank you. Thank you.

187
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,305
- My mother's recipe.
- Wow.

188
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:16,875
Take the fork.
Just take the fork.

189
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,388
- Right, do you want me to cut it?
- No.

190
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,217
Why don't you just...?

191
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,786
I say just rip it.

192
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,421
Take it, oh.

193
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,725
- Yeah.
- Hey.

194
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:41,133
So, Robert, uh, Lenny tells us

195
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,836
that you just finished
an exhibition.

196
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,205
- I think it was photography.
- Photography. Yeah.

197
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,239
- Cool.
- Yeah.

198
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:48,708
That was a few years ago.

199
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:55,147
I'm currently working
on other things,

200
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,348
personal things.

201
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:58,416
- Anna
- Hmm?

202
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,754
- is an actress.
- Hmm.

203
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,156
Well, I work at a restaurant.

204
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:07,759
<i>That's crazy 'cause I
also work at a restaurant.</i>

205
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,129
- Yeah?
- Funny enough, I'm...

206
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,064
I'm actually a barista.

207
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:15,100
It's kind of, uh, you know,
it's a... it's a passion.

208
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,902
- Cool.
- Yeah. It's nice.

209
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,470
I work at a preschool.

210
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,907
Oh, cool.

211
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,309
Robert shot Jesse Singleton's
album cover.

212
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,912
Oh! I love that album!

213
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:29,448
We used to listen to that album
all the time, right?

214
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,049
We sure did.
A great record.

215
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,952
And, uh, which...

216
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:38,122
which part
did you actually shoot?

217
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,291
It was on the cover
of the album.

218
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,794
- Yeah.
- It was great stuff.

219
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:45,230
- It was in the alley.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:49,368
Well, so, what do you do
at the preschool?

221
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,002
I do like attendance.

222
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:54,839
I walk the kids from class
to class, you know?

223
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,307
That's great.

224
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:59,110
Creative environment for you
to make your art in.

225
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,547
No. Actually,
it's pretty miserable.

226
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,417
My parents run the school
and they're crazy.

227
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,954
And, to top it off, my dad just
enrolled a new student today,

228
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:11,122
who happens to be
his estranged daughter

229
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:13,925
from a woman
who is not my mother.

230
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,061
So it's a pretty dark time
in my life right now.

231
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,465
Thank you so much
for having us over.

232
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,967
- Our pleasure.
- Yeah. Dig in!

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,134
Fantastic.

234
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,110
New York City's a great place
to raise a child.

235
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:34,278
Dad, I thought about it
and I'm not gonna meet them.

236
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,913
If that means I'm gonna
lose my job, then...

237
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,317
Robert, speak of the devil.

238
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,952
- This is...
- I know you.

239
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:44,322
- You do?
- Sara-Beth!

240
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:47,860
Wh... where did you say
that we met before?

241
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,897
I shot Jesse's album
cover in the alley?

242
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:55,000
We hung out at the bar after.

243
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,071
- Oh!
- Yeah.

244
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,038
- Oh, wow. Okay.
- Yeah.

245
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:04,976
Oh, my goodness.
So you're Harry's... s... son.

246
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,312
- Son, exactly. Yeah.
- Okay. Hi.

247
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,581
Wow. How nice.

248
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,149
I found your number.

249
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:13,552
I tried to call you
like a thousand times.

250
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:16,054
How's Jesse doin'?
He's doing...? He's good?

251
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:19,924
He's good. He's good.
He's workin' on a new album.

252
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,993
What are you doin' here?

253
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,095
I...

254
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,599
- Mommy!
- Hey, pretty girl.

255
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,667
Can you say hello to Robert?

256
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:32,170
Hi.

257
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:37,475
Robert, this is
Mason's mother, Sara.

258
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,044
Harry, Lynn Aldridge
would like to speak with you.

259
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,014
- About what?
- Naptime.

260
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,950
She thinks 30 minutes
is excessive.

261
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:46,951
I'll be there.
Give me a second.

262
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,692
- Okay. So did we...?
- What?

263
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,093
You don't think
he knows about...?

264
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,261
No.

265
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,466
I'm so sorry.
This is weird for me,

266
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:04,569
<i>but it must be very
weird for you.</i>

267
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,471
Yeah.

268
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:08,507
So we probably shouldn't
tell him that we...

269
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:11,309
No. I think...
I think we... we can omit...

270
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,947
So, small world, huh?

271
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,382
Question:
How did you two meet?

272
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:20,451
I went back to that bar where
you and your friends hang out.

273
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:25,223
- Ha.
- Wait. What bar? My bar?

274
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,225
I guess.

275
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,493
Why would you
go back there alone?

276
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,194
You're too old for that bar.

277
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:33,664
Uh, apparently not, Robert.

278
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,167
My fuckin' bar.

279
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,372
Jesus Christ.

280
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,179
Be careful, Easy Rider.

281
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:14,205
Hey. You ready to party?

282
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,639
Remember her?

283
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,476
Let's see here.

284
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:21,545
Yeah.
The eyes, the ass, the rack.

285
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,414
Yeah, of course.

286
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,216
I also remember you fuckin' her.
I was in the room next door.

287
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,086
My dad fucked her, too.

288
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,455
Uh, sorry, I thought you said

289
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:33,558
that your father actually
had sex with her.

290
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,461
Yeah.

291
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:38,562
Wow.

292
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:42,134
Oh, my god.

293
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:46,071
Uh, yeah. Oh, man.

294
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:47,372
All right.
Well, we gotta go.

295
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:48,644
Let's talk about it on the way.

296
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,783
Think my dad
is getting off on all this?

297
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:03,455
Yeah. It's possible.

298
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:06,225
I mean, it's negative thinking,
but it's possible.

299
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:13,464
<i>You know, you could be
Mason's father.</i>

300
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:15,534
No. That's impossible.
I've thought about it.

301
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,335
I'm not.

302
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:21,839
- When was she born?
- Uh, January 20-somethin'.

303
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,276
And when did you
shoot the album cover?

304
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:27,711
- May.
- No. It got released in May.

305
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,313
You shot it in April.

306
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,751
It's possible.

307
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,754
Think about it.
It's possible.

308
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,310
- What's up?
- Uh, nothin'. Uh...

309
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,412
Nothin'.
Do you remember Sara-Beth?

310
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:03,615
She was that blonde stylist
at your shoot.

311
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,550
We hung out with her
at our bar after.

312
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:10,822
- What bar?
- Uh...

313
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,656
Oh.
I can't believe it's you.

314
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,125
I haven't seen you
in months, man.

315
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,594
What have you been up to?
Anything new?

316
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,662
No. Just cruisin'.

317
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:21,866
Mm. Cruisin'. Nice.

318
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:29,273
- Are you done with that album?
- It's done.

319
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,876
- It's slated for spring, man.
- Cool.

320
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,246
We should do like another
album cover together.

321
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:35,713
- Really?
- Let's do something big. Yeah.

322
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,782
- You sure?
- Totally. I bet we can pay you,

323
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,918
- this time, too.
- All right.

324
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:43,721
- Aubrey. Hey.
- Hey.

325
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,423
Let's go, Jesse.

326
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:47,759
Robert, this is Aubrey.
Aubrey, this is Robert.

327
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,627
- Hi.
- We met.

328
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,897
- Oh.
- A couple of times, we met.

329
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,168
- Yeah.
- Hey. I'll call you, yeah?

330
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,269
Yeah. Cool.

331
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:03,841
Cruisin'.
Who says cruisin'?

332
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,779
Oh, hey. Excuse me.
Sorry.

333
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:13,884
- Was that Jesse Singleton?
- No.

334
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,319
Hmm.

335
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,163
- Hey, Robert.
- Hey, Anna.

336
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:30,501
Nice shirt.

337
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,375
'Cause we're...
we are wearing the same shirt.

338
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,478
Yep.

339
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,613
Small world.

340
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:49,887
I never knew you were
such a good conversationalist.

341
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:56,461
- Oh, my god.
- You okay?

342
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,263
April.

343
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:00,399
Kidding.

344
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,605
April. Yeah.

345
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,394
Okay.

346
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay. So the evidence
is pretty overwhelming.

347
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,767
Mm-hmm.

348
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,271
But, you know, maybe neither
of you is the father.

349
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,441
I mean, she's in fashion.

350
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:49,281
I mean, I gotta tell him,
though, right?

351
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,615
Yeah.
I'm gonna come with you.

352
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:52,916
- I'm an uncle.
- Put your hand...

353
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,586
You're not my brother.

354
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:57,321
- You're not an uncle.
- Whoa whoa whoa. We've lived

355
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:59,035
together for 5 years.
We've grown together.

356
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,759
We've regressed together.
That makes me an uncle.

357
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,026
I can't.
I can't handle these

358
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,428
bizarre life calculations
right now.

359
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:06,698
All right. Furthermore,
I don't wanna be like

360
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,633
one of those pedophile,
bizarre like

361
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:10,402
take-the-kid-to-the-ballpark
uncles.

362
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,369
I wanna be, you know,

363
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:15,307
great uncle Lenny,
imparting wisdom.

364
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,875
- If you're comin', let's go.
- Are we going?

365
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,746
I'm ready. I'm ready.

366
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:36,560
I don't think he's here.

367
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,962
- What are you...?
- Oops!

368
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:42,467
Home, sweet home,

369
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,669
where father and son
once romped.

370
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:46,337
Shut up.

371
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,007
Come on, man. I'm trying
to create a loving context

372
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,909
for this announcement.
Stay positive.

373
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:58,849
Hey, do you still
have porn on this TV?

374
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:01,385
- Lenny.
- What?

375
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,620
Oh, come on.

376
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,389
Look, it's a scientific method.

377
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:05,990
Look.

378
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:08,559
Don't make me feel bad for
trying to better myself, man.

379
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,968
Ahem.

380
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:26,076
- Dad.
- I'm in here.

381
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:29,046
Agh!

382
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,814
So much for Mom's yoga studio.

383
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,517
Ah-ha.

384
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,653
Agggh!

385
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:41,125
From every difficulty
comes opportunity.

386
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,560
Who said that?

387
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:44,962
- Liberace.
- Close.

388
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,666
- Albert Einstein.
- Mm.

389
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:52,537
Dad, we need to talk.

390
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:54,438
Okay.

391
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,540
One more set.

392
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:57,808
You may have to spot me.

393
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:00,078
Uh!

394
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,579
A little red?

395
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:02,848
No, thank you.

396
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,752
Ah.

397
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:12,490
- So, tell me.
- Right. Ahem.

398
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:15,959
- Oh, hi, Harold.
- Oh. Hello, Lenny.

399
00:23:15,992 --> 00:23:17,694
- Mind if I join you guys?
- Well...

400
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:21,865
FYI, your porn channels
are down.

401
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:25,102
I don't have
porn channels, Lenny, FYI.

402
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,696
- That's my point.
- What're you wastin'

403
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:28,071
my time for?
Why do you come into my house?

404
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,707
- You're attacking me.
- I'm attacking you 'cause

405
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,974
- I just came in here.
- You come and you wanna

406
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,610
- watch porn at my house?
- Well, yeah.

407
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:34,045
Don't do it.
Don't touch my stuff.

408
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:35,646
I don't understand
this hostility towards me.

409
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,816
Mason might be my daughter.

410
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:40,585
- What?
- We had unprotected sex.

411
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:43,120
We had... Me and Sara-Beth.
We. Me and Sara-Beth.

412
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:46,191
Congratulations, Grandpa.
Must be quite a relief.

413
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:49,461
Why are you here?

414
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:53,597
Dad, I had sex with her
at least a week before you did.

415
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,133
Wh... what is this?

416
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:57,134
Documentation.
Lenny took it.

417
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,703
He can vouch for the events
that followed.

418
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,105
Our walls are paper-thin.

419
00:24:01,137 --> 00:24:03,006
And I watched.
Only for a minute.

420
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,109
- Please leave.
- Yeah. Right away.

421
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,783
- Dad, it might be...
- What... what... what is this?

422
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,218
Come on. What, is this
some kind of payback

423
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,252
for me cheatin' on your mom,
goin' to your bar.

424
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:18,155
- Just look at the date.
- April '09.

425
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:21,993
Yes. Okay. So that is 9 months
before Mason is born.

426
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:25,596
Think about it, Harry.
It checks out.

427
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,866
Get the fuck outta my house!

428
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,600
You can ask her!

429
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,801
I hate him.

430
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:39,877
- Are you sure?
- I'm pretty sure, yes.

431
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,112
Yes, I'm sure.

432
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:47,585
Wow.

433
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:50,120
Ha ha. Okay.

434
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,827
All right.
Did you tell Sara yet?

435
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:59,597
- No. Not yet.
- All right.

436
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,734
- Oh, my god. What are you doin'?
- What's it look like

437
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,235
- I'm doin', Robert?
- You're not gonna call her.

438
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:06,136
This is not a business call.
We have to tell her this

439
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,539
- in person.
- The DNA test is tomorrow.

440
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:13,144
You're coming and she needs
time to process this.

441
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:14,645
Why don't you guys
just have a three-way?

442
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,315
Oh, my...

443
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:20,085
Conference call,
like a hard line.

444
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,655
What?

445
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,293
No, Daddy,
we are fine on our own.

446
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,661
It doesn't matter where we are.

447
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:32,763
I am not telling...

448
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,699
Daddy, I gotta go.
I have another call. Okay?

449
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:40,572
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi! Hi, Sara.

450
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,105
- Uh, Robert's here too.
- I'm here. I'm here.

451
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:45,342
- Oh. Hi, Robert.
- Hi.

452
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,077
So, there's been
this whole...

453
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:52,584
development
in the fatherhood situation.

454
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,952
Uh, yeah, so there's, uh,

455
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,021
documentation that exists

456
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:00,758
that indicates that you and I
may have had...

457
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,225
Just get to it.

458
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,929
That we might both be
the father.

459
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:08,900
Okay. Um...

460
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:11,736
Well, will the test be able
to sort that kind of thing out

461
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,939
- or...?
- A- Absolutely.

462
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:18,875
- Are you okay?
- All right.

463
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,980
- Are you o...?
- Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm fine.

464
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:24,182
I'll see you...

465
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:27,818
both of you... tomorrow
at the doctor's, I guess.

466
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,953
- Okay.
- All right.

467
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:30,288
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

468
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,756
Ohhh.

469
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,024
"Both be the father,"
seriously?

470
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:35,626
- Yeah.
- That's what you came up with?

471
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,695
- Okay. All right.
- Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys.

472
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:38,830
It's confusing.

473
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:56,114
- How's Miriam, Harry?
- Oh, she's great.

474
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:58,048
She's still on vacation.

475
00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:59,751
Interesting time
to take a vacation.

476
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,788
Yeah.

477
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,961
May I ask how Daddy and Junior

478
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:11,862
ended up dipping
in the same well?

479
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,968
- Hey, guys!
- Hey.

480
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:18,436
How you doin'?
Sorry I'm a little late.

481
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:20,203
Mwah. Good to see you.

482
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:22,740
Hi. Sara-Beth Walsh.

483
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:24,375
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.</i>

484
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,176
And this is
my daughter, Mason.

485
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,079
- Hi.
- Hi!

486
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,416
So, the process is simple.

487
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,284
We take a hair,
we draw some blood,

488
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:35,219
send it to the geneticist.

489
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,788
Should take about a week
to get a result.

490
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,954
- Great.
- Okay.

491
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:41,092
Thank you.

492
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,960
- How are you?
- Good! We're good.

493
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:46,129
- Is the blood draw necessary?
- Robert, man up, will ya?

494
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:47,298
- For God's sake.
- You know, you're the one

495
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,733
- having a midlife crisis.
- Oh.

496
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:53,071
Hi. I mean, who's
the 4-Year-old around here?

497
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,971
- Can we stop? Can we stop?
- Is it you, or is it her?

498
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,441
Enough. Enough.

499
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:58,775
Robert's afraid of blood,
so, he's scared.

500
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:01,311
- Oh, really?
- Take it easy. It's all right.

501
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:02,747
You'll live through this.

502
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:08,485
Ahem!

503
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,854
Who's first?

504
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:31,508
Sometimes I wish I hadn't
converted the building

505
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,478
into a preschool,
but, parents will always

506
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:36,213
- take care of their kids first.
- Right.

507
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,182
- That's the rule.
- That's true.

508
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:41,485
And kids?
Kids are very good business.

509
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:51,895
Sara-Beth, check this out.

510
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:56,968
Oh, I remember these.

511
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,103
They supposed
to be that grainy?

512
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:00,937
Yeah. You should look at 'em
with your glasses on

513
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:02,140
next time, Dad.

514
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,208
Aha ha ha.

515
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,412
Ahem. Let's go, kids.

516
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,885
Sara-Beth,
are you still in fashion?

517
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,254
- Guilty.
- Yeah. Now she's starting

518
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,456
her own clothing line, Robert,
branding herself

519
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:20,191
and everything like that.
It's kind of great.

520
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:22,527
A girl can dream, right?

521
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,796
- Ha ha.
- Yeah, I salvage

522
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:28,899
vintage dresses, jewelry,
that kind of stuff.

523
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:31,469
And why'd you leave New York?

524
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:35,306
You know, being in Knoxville
with my family

525
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:38,542
seemed like a much more
viable option.

526
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:42,380
They really helped out a lot.
They essentially raised her.

527
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,115
Well, it is good
to have you back.

528
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:47,150
- Thank...
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

529
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:50,821
Aw, thank you. Yeah.
It's... it's good to be back.

530
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,824
I... I love New York.

531
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:56,027
And, plus, I wanted Mason
to meet her father.

532
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,028
I think she thought
my dad was her dad,

533
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:00,230
<i>so it was getting
a little confusing.</i>

534
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:03,900
Yeah. I can't believe you
didn't know all that, Robert.

535
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,101
H... how would I know that?

536
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:06,903
She was living in Texas.

537
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:09,372
Actually, Tennessee.
Knoxville, Tennessee.

538
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:11,942
Heh. Had to leave him back
a year. He's a little slow.

539
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,179
Oh.

540
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,948
So, in the meantime,

541
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,284
I'm actually doing styling
for Tosh Wolfe?

542
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:22,185
Wow. That's...
I... I love him.

543
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:23,988
I... I have one of his books.

544
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,288
Cool. Good.

545
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:28,191
He's amazing.

546
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,926
He's a photographer, Dad.

547
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,462
I realize that, Robert.

548
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:33,898
I bought you that book.

549
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:41,238
Well, guys,

550
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:44,942
thank you so much
for dealing with me and...

551
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:46,376
- Hey.
- Staying with me

552
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,446
- throughout all of this.
- Don't worry about it.

553
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:52,149
- It's not a problem.
- All right, well, I guess

554
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:53,651
I'll see you both
at the end of the week.

555
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:55,219
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, listen,

556
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:59,656
if Mason needs anything...
clothes, shoes,

557
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,393
I don't know, uh, toys...
take care of it.

558
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:07,197
And Joyce will be dropping
her off here after work.

559
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,166
- Thank you so much, Harry.
- I get paid next week,

560
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,604
so I can chip in.

561
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:17,674
Thank you.
Thank you both, so much.

562
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,177
<i>Call me if you need
anything, okay?</i>

563
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,413
- Yeah, I will.
- All right.

564
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:25,615
Hopefully, next week,
it won't be so weird, ha.

565
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:26,683
- Word.
- Okay.

566
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,553
- Yeah, word.
- Bye, guys.

567
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,390
- Ahem.
- Ahem.

568
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,067
By the way, I saw the way
that you were looking at her.

569
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:45,201
Right. Right.
And you weren't.

570
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,137
Let me make something
clear, all right?

571
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,640
<i>I am not interested in that kind
of relationship with Sara.</i>

572
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:52,911
<i>Wh... what kind of relationship
are you interested in?</i>

573
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,482
Look, do us both a favor
and keep it in your pants

574
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:02,452
until we know what's what
and who's whose.

575
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:03,621
Got it.

576
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,528
By the way, her name is Mason

577
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,496
and I'm perfectly capable
of being a father.

578
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:14,565
Yeah, that's
some father figure,

579
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:16,733
living in a shithole with Lenny.

580
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:20,237
Have fun on your little
scooter, dear.

581
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:23,507
Dear.

582
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:26,009
Son of a fuck!

583
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,579
Heh.

584
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,150
Ahem.

585
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,288
Hi, honey. It's me.

586
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,557
Right.
Yeah, that's good.

587
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,092
I got good news.

588
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:46,096
You're being way
too grim about this.

589
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,633
Elaborate on how
I'm being too grim.

590
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,168
You're lucky
you can be a father.

591
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:53,738
You're lucky you have a father
who would support you,

592
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,673
if you are a father and,
chances are,

593
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:59,676
your father is the actual
father of said child.

594
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,245
That's pretty good advice,
coming from a guy

595
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:03,279
who never knew his father,
right?

596
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:05,549
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

597
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:09,353
Look, I'm just saying
that, you know,

598
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:11,588
I don't know.
It's complicated.

599
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,291
I don't know. Either way,
I think I gotta at least

600
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:16,494
kind of figure this out
with Sara-Beth.

601
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,661
- No. No.
- Right? At least.

602
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,195
No. No. No.

603
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:21,332
Stay away from her.

604
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:22,799
She might be fucking
your father.

605
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,535
- Lenny...
- You know, if you want to get

606
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,569
that image out of your head,
you can watch some porn.

607
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:29,039
Hey, Anna!

608
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,442
Hello.

609
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:35,045
Hey. How you been?

610
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,513
You know? I am good.

611
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,714
Good.

612
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:39,717
You guys just chillin'?

613
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,117
Good.

614
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,788
What?

615
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,122
We're good.

616
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,228
Um...

617
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,465
how is your... situation?

618
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:56,634
What?

619
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,234
Oh, I told her.

620
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:01,204
- Thanks, Lenny.
- Sure.

621
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:03,507
Um,

622
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:08,344
I'll probably figure it
out in a few days.

623
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:09,646
More like Connect Three, huh?

624
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,083
- Ha.
- Hmm? What?

625
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,119
Don't worry about it.

626
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:25,362
Do you... want a sandwich?

627
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:27,565
Hmm... no. No.

628
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:30,101
I was just walking by.

629
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,568
Cool.

630
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:32,737
Yeah.

631
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:36,572
You guys should meet up
next week.

632
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:41,578
- That works. That works for me.
- Sure. Works for me.

633
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,713
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

634
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,215
- He can call you.
- That's great.

635
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:47,217
- That's a great idea.
- Right?

636
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,121
Great. I'll call you.

637
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:53,791
Goo-oo-d. Okay.
I'm gonna...

638
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,793
Ha!

639
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,532
- She great?
- You don't find it weird

640
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:03,701
that she just invites herself
to the table?

641
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,768
- Perfectly normal.
- Normal?

642
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:08,172
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my god. Look at this.

643
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:09,706
Connect four.
I didn't even realize.

644
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,708
Look at that.
You want to play again?

645
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,114
I love this place.

646
00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:40,837
You excited?

647
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,644
Here we go.
Go on inside.

648
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,313
Why aren't you inside?

649
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:50,748
- Day off.
- Oh.

650
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,682
- Yeah.
- Cool.

651
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:59,489
You wanna grab some coffee
or something downtown?

652
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:00,824
Yeah.

653
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:02,259
Yeah, that would be great.

654
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:05,563
Do we just hop
on the Metro and go?

655
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:09,733
We could hop on the Metro,
but we call it the subway.

656
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:13,237
Well, then, why do they
call it a MetroCard?

657
00:36:23,646 --> 00:36:26,217
We have three dogs at home.

658
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,621
One of them used to be mine,
until I had Mason.

659
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:33,224
How's she doing?

660
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,960
She's doing okay.

661
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:37,728
This is confusing for her.

662
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,530
Oh, yeah. I mean.

663
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:41,931
Um.

664
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,802
She seems happy.

665
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:48,239
Out-outwardly.

666
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:52,242
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

667
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:53,476
She's my baby girl.

668
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:06,456
Let me get a little bit more.

669
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:08,425
All right.

670
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,898
Do you smoke a lot of pot,
Robert?

671
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:19,636
Um, not really.
My... My roommate Lenny does.

672
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:23,574
Lenny the pothead.

673
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:30,481
So I have a question for you.

674
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,383
Mm-hmm.

675
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,885
If today was your day off,

676
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:40,356
then what were you doing
at the school?

677
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:41,824
I, uh,

678
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:46,764
I left my wallet there,
so I had to pick it up.

679
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:47,898
Oh.

680
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:54,737
Oh. This is gorgeous!
Isn't it?

681
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:56,473
- It's nice.
- Speaking of that,

682
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:58,708
why don't you
have your camera on you?

683
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:01,577
Actually, I haven't been
taking a lot of photos recently.

684
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,547
It's been less and less, anyway.

685
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:05,949
- Really?
- Yeah.

686
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:07,583
Everyone's a photographer now

687
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:10,354
and it takes a really long time
to get good at it

688
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:12,623
and really know
what you're doing.

689
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,659
It's complicated.

690
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:19,063
Well, maybe you just need
to rethink your approach,

691
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,931
you know.
For the longest time, I thought

692
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:24,567
I wanted to be a singer
or a dancer and dress up

693
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:27,438
and then I realized that
I just like to dress up.

694
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:32,442
Oh!

695
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,079
Hey, guys! Excuse me.

696
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,747
My friend can get a picture
of all of you guys together.

697
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,482
- Oh.
- He's a very talented

698
00:38:38,514 --> 00:38:39,916
- photographer.
- Sara. Sara, no.

699
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:42,051
<i>And he would love
to take a photo of you.</i>

700
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:43,353
- Oh, god.
- Come on.

701
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,855
Thank you.

702
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:48,092
Works for us.

703
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,893
Mm.

704
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,934
Say, uh, "Diane Arbus."

705
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:01,003
Diane Arbus.

706
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:03,740
- There.
- Perfect.

707
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:06,076
You're welcome.

708
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:07,811
You're right. He is good.

709
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:10,146
Oh, good. Take care.

710
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:12,582
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

711
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:17,420
- Now, why was that so hard?
- I don't know.

712
00:39:17,454 --> 00:39:18,722
You did good!

713
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:26,697
Hey, do you want
to walk me home?

714
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,965
Don't you have to
pick up Mason?

715
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:31,567
Whoops! Whoa.

716
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:33,704
Guess I totally forgot. Um.

717
00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:37,041
Kind of new at this whole
single-mom thing.

718
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,431
Uh, listen, listen.

719
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:02,465
Just because they say
it's ecofriendly

720
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:05,601
doesn't mean it's ecofriendly.

721
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:06,670
Do I personally care?

722
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:09,739
Yes, I care a great deal.

723
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,541
But the information
that they're giving you

724
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:13,876
is only as reliable as the
person who's giving it to you

725
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:16,512
and what are you paying me for?

726
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:19,182
Look, it is
a free-standing structure.

727
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:20,616
It's not a building.

728
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,985
I can't tell you
how many times...

729
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,769
Hey, Daisy.
Oh, sorry.

730
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:41,038
You'll say hello one day.

731
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:49,580
- Robert!
- How you doing? You having fun?

732
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:50,847
- Yeah.
- You want a snack?

733
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,982
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's get a snack.

734
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:00,657
Wait up, wait up.

735
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,791
You're gonna color
on the table, okay?

736
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:03,226
- I need help.
- Yeah?

737
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,262
Come over here and then
I'll help you, all right?

738
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,563
Oh, Isabella and Maya,
this is gorgeous.

739
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:09,099
So, ladies, if you can take it,

740
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:10,967
we're going to put it over
there, by the easel, okay?

741
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,003
- Okay.
- Hey, Mason.

742
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,241
You have one?
You can use that one, then.

743
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:21,811
That is a very nice painting.

744
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:25,214
It's Gram-gram
and Hooty's house.

745
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,251
- I miss Hooty.
- Yeah?

746
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:32,154
What kinds of things did you
and Hooty used to do together?

747
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:35,826
All kind of things.

748
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:38,694
Did Hooty teach you how
to paint like this?

749
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:40,597
No. Mommy did.

750
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:48,639
Who's Harry?

751
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,041
<i>Harry is my dad.</i>

752
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:53,844
<i>And he might be my daddy?</i>

753
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:55,179
He might be.

754
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:01,117
You want to see something?

755
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,585
You know how to use this?

756
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,588
No?

757
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:07,557
Ready?

758
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:12,762
You want to give it a try?

759
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:15,197
Put it up to your eye.

760
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,001
There you go.
And you point over at me.

761
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:19,903
You see this button up top?

762
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:24,141
Just press it as hard as you can
until you see the thing flash.

763
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:25,976
Ready?
There you go.

764
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,744
That was perfect.
That was really perfect.

765
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,928
Mommy, Robert said
Harry might be my dad.

766
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,630
I thought Hooty was my daddy.

767
00:42:47,664 --> 00:42:49,066
It's complicated, baby.

768
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,635
Robert could be my daddy.

769
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:55,172
- He's cool.
- Maybe. We'll find out soon.

770
00:44:08,478 --> 00:44:10,180
Mm-hmm.

771
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:12,382
I know you said a week,
Dr. Schnieder, but...

772
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,851
Ugh! All right.

773
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:18,255
Do we have a winner?

774
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,291
- Shouldn't you be at work?
- I'm hungover.

775
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,335
So, I think my dad
stole my moped.

776
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,769
He didn't.

777
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:36,906
But even if he did,
good riddance.

778
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,809
That thing literally
menstruates.

779
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,286
Hey, hey, hey.

780
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:50,786
Yeah. What's up?

781
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:56,425
About that Tosh Wolfe job.

782
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,828
Yeah. It's, um,

783
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,030
it's killing me.

784
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:03,233
Um, I was gonna ask you:

785
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:07,903
do you think that you could
pick up Mason after school?

786
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:09,839
Sure. Yeah. That's great.

787
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,907
Okay. All right.
All right. Bye.

788
00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:21,784
Get dressed.
I'm babysitting.

789
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:24,454
Really? Yes!

790
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:25,927
Maybe we can take her
to the airport.

791
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:29,860
That's a good idea.
Kids like planes.

792
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:33,195
No. No. Not for the planes,
for the drama.

793
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:35,097
I mean, the arriving,
the leaving.

794
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,167
People hugging, people crying.

795
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:40,036
It's a tableau
of human emotion.

796
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:42,773
I don't think kids
are really into that stuff.

797
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,976
- Sure they are. I was.
- Yeah, like I said,

798
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,850
I don't think kids are
into that kind of stuff.

799
00:45:49,978 --> 00:45:52,214
You're undermining
my uncle confidence, Robert.

800
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:55,152
- Can we go? Please. Let's go.
- I'm ready to go.

801
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:57,788
- Okay. Let's get up. Up!
- I'm ready to go.

802
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,121
All right.
Let's get some pants on

803
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,458
- and some shoes, all right?
- I have pants on.

804
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:04,027
<i>- No. No. Like real pants.
- They are real pants.</i>

805
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:06,028
- What you see is what you get.
- Shoes. All right?

806
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:11,367
Hey, Joyce.

807
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,837
We're here.

808
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:16,440
Okay. Okay.

809
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,210
She's gonna bring her out.

810
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:23,046
I look okay?

811
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,483
Relax. She's 4.

812
00:46:26,516 --> 00:46:27,951
I don't know what that means.

813
00:46:35,557 --> 00:46:36,960
Hey, Mason.

814
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:40,063
- Hi.
- Hi, Joyce.

815
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:42,565
I like that shirt, Mason.

816
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,603
Harry took us
to the planetarian.

817
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:47,938
To the what?

818
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,840
- The planetarian.
- The planetarium.

819
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,342
Oh, cool. Cool beans.

820
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,878
This is Lenny.

821
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:58,347
- Hi. I'm Mason.
- Hi, Mason.

822
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,551
Do you know Robert
might be my dad?

823
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:04,387
I did know that.

824
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,056
I was actually
in the adjacent room

825
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:07,857
when you were being conceived.

826
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,293
Oh, my god!

827
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:14,130
- Goodbye, Robert.
- Bye, Joyce.

828
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:16,565
Hey Mason, you have somewhere
safe you can put this?

829
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,235
You have a pocket in here?

830
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,568
Yeah? All right. Okay.

831
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,170
So put it in here

832
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:24,140
and don't let Joyce
take it from you, okay?

833
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,642
- Okay.
- So you want to go somewhere

834
00:47:26,675 --> 00:47:30,145
way more fun than
that boring old planetarium?

835
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,249
- Yeah!
- How about the airport?

836
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:36,887
- Lenny.
- What?

837
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,588
All right. Let's go.

838
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:41,991
Go ahead.

839
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:50,199
Ah. C'mere.

840
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,001
Oh!

841
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:53,269
Dude.

842
00:47:57,106 --> 00:48:01,344
Hey, Mason, no matter
what that light says,

843
00:48:01,376 --> 00:48:03,980
don't go until you see
another person go first,

844
00:48:04,012 --> 00:48:05,614
- all right?
- Yeah.

845
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:09,385
All right.
Let's do it. Let's go.

846
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:10,653
Uh, take my hand?

847
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,380
Get in there, kiddo.

848
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,083
Oh, good.
You asked out Anna.

849
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:43,119
What? No.
No, I didn't.

850
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:44,954
- Who is that? Who are you...?
- That was Brie.

851
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:47,423
- She heard it from Jack.
- No, I said we'd hang out.

852
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:49,058
- That's it.
- Stop being defensive.

853
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,372
- How am I being defensive?
- Hi!

854
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,061
Relax! Can't be
so negative around Mason.

855
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:53,730
- Hey, Sampson.
- So, when are you gonna

856
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:56,398
- bring back my favorite photo?
- Look, I'm sorry.

857
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:58,701
Next time, I'll bring it back.
Okay.

858
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:04,039
I don't like that actresses
can cry on command.

859
00:49:04,072 --> 00:49:05,574
That freaks me out.

860
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:08,311
- Do you think she can do that?
- Probably.

861
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:10,079
- Can you find that out for me?
- Yeah.

862
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:11,480
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

863
00:49:11,514 --> 00:49:13,234
I gotta admit,
she is kind of interesting.

864
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:20,255
You're our director,
so you get us started.

865
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:21,591
- Ready?
- Ready.

866
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:24,393
Ready.
Say "action."

867
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:26,496
Action!

868
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:29,532
¶ Ah do-do do-do do-do ¶

869
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:31,233
Here we are.

870
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:33,369
Thank you, Diane.

871
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:34,703
That is your lion friend?

872
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:36,172
What are you doin' here, Lion?

873
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,442
Is this supposed to be a joke?

874
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,412
No, I thought
it would be nice.

875
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:44,180
No, I don't think it's nice
that she's spending

876
00:49:44,213 --> 00:49:45,415
this kind of time
in your apartment,

877
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:46,449
in your crappy neighborhood.

878
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:47,684
It's not good for her.

879
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:52,221
Jesus Christ.

880
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,324
Well, at least I know she's
not riding around with you

881
00:49:54,356 --> 00:49:57,159
on that death trap of yours.

882
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:58,695
So you stole my moped?

883
00:49:58,728 --> 00:50:02,197
- Really?
- Really.

884
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:03,733
You're potentially
about to be a father.

885
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:05,434
You're worried
about your little moped?

886
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,360
Hey.

887
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:32,461
Hey, Robert.
How you doin'?

888
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:34,797
Good. You busy at work?

889
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:37,467
Yeah.
I'm actually superbusy.

890
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,336
Would you... would you take
Mason home again for me?

891
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,105
Um, yeah, sure.
No problem.

892
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:45,642
Okay. Thank you again.
Okay, bye.

893
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:09,432
Listen,
if you're going to smoke,

894
00:51:09,465 --> 00:51:11,134
can you point it
towards the window?

895
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,405
Just can we be done with this?

896
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:16,539
Yes. Please.

897
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:18,340
It's a process, guys.

898
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:25,380
- Can you relax?
- I remember you.

899
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:27,550
- Yeah.
- Relax.

900
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,452
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

901
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,221
- Where's Mason?
- It's okay.

902
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:36,391
- She's asleep in Robert's room.
- Oh.

903
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:37,561
You okay?

904
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,197
How was she?

905
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:43,871
She was great.
We had a really good day.

906
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,536
- We went all around the city.
- No. No. No.

907
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:48,204
We went to the airport.

908
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:51,208
Incredible.
She had a great time.

909
00:51:54,443 --> 00:51:58,715
So, by overloading your brain
with erotic material,

910
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:02,385
<i>you're stripping away
every physical idea</i>

911
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:05,221
that initially attracts you
to women,

912
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:10,926
thus creating a true,
meaningful relationship.

913
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,528
Exactly.

914
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,829
Isn't that comforting?

915
00:52:20,902 --> 00:52:24,239
Don't let Mason
get into Tom Petty.

916
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:25,942
- Okay.
- She'll sell herself short

917
00:52:25,974 --> 00:52:28,577
for like the rest of her life.

918
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,480
- Mommy!
- Ah!

919
00:52:30,512 --> 00:52:31,614
What?

920
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:38,588
Okay. Okay. All right.
We're fine.

921
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:44,326
I think she saw my D.

922
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:48,597
Might be the first D
she's ever seen.

923
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:52,701
This might mean
something, right?

924
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:55,305
Yeah.
I'm gonna see you guys later.

925
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,573
Yeah. Take care.

926
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,843
Right?

927
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:02,812
It's getting late.
I'm gonna put Mason

928
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:05,347
- to bed here, okay?
- Sorry.

929
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,449
- What are you doing?
- Sleep on the couch.

930
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,586
So, there is exactly one egg
in this apartment.

931
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:45,788
Who wants it?

932
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,456
- Me!
- You want it? All right.

933
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:52,628
- I do. I do.
- Oh, what the...?

934
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:02,304
- There you go.
- There we go.

935
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:04,740
- How's that look?
- Thank you.

936
00:54:04,773 --> 00:54:08,877
- You're welcome.
- Good job.

937
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:12,648
- So how's your business going?
- Oh, um, it's just starting up.

938
00:54:12,681 --> 00:54:15,884
Harry's sending me to his lawyer
to get incorporated.

939
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:17,019
Great.

940
00:54:17,052 --> 00:54:19,855
I could help you with that.

941
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,724
Yeah.
Believe it or not, Lenny

942
00:54:22,757 --> 00:54:25,560
probably knows that world
much better than my father,

943
00:54:25,594 --> 00:54:28,298
in terms of legal jargon
and all that.

944
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,699
Really?

945
00:54:29,731 --> 00:54:31,601
Well, that would be
really great, actually,

946
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:33,969
<i>'cause Harry's already
doing so much.</i>

947
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:39,809
- How is that?
- So, yeah.

948
00:54:39,842 --> 00:54:40,943
How's Tosh?

949
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:43,746
Pretty terrible, but, you know.

950
00:54:43,778 --> 00:54:46,014
You gotta work
to get work, right?

951
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:47,049
You know what I mean?

952
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,918
Are you gonna go get a job?

953
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:50,420
I think it's time
for you to get a job.

954
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:51,521
No-o-o.

955
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,356
No-o-o?

956
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,392
Mason, I can put you to work.
You can clean my room.

957
00:54:56,425 --> 00:55:00,463
I'm serious.

958
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:01,931
You can come over.
It's up to you.

959
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,065
Robert.

960
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:07,936
- Yeah.
- Hi, Harry.

961
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:12,607
Hi, honey.
So, Sara-Beth spent the night

962
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:15,043
<i>at your apartment again
last night?</i>

963
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,747
Yeah, so?

964
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,016
- Did you sleep with her?
- What?

965
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:21,384
What kind of question is that?

966
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:22,918
A direct one. Answer it.

967
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,387
No! Of course not!

968
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,489
I helped her out with Mason.

969
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:27,956
Let me guess:
Mason's exposed

970
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:30,559
to pot smoking, pornography,
and shitty Chinese food?

971
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:32,060
Actually, we had
a really great day together.

972
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:34,496
Did I not ask you to wait
till we get the results?

973
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,631
- I understand.
- Did I ask you?

974
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:38,468
Really?
You two, just stop it.

975
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,969
Enough!

976
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:41,971
Hi, Miriam.

977
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:44,740
Hi, Mom. Ahem.

978
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:46,041
Welcome home.

979
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:48,877
Where is she?

980
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:50,913
Mason?

981
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:52,114
Right there.

982
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,052
Oh.

983
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:02,692
She's beautiful.

984
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:07,529
Hey, Mason.
Come over here.

985
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:10,066
- This is Miriam. Miriam's my mom.
- Hi.

986
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:12,000
Hi.

987
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:20,442
Well, I think I'm gonna be
a grandmother.

988
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:22,512
- Not necessarily.
- Hi.

989
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,514
Shut up, Harry.

990
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:26,782
Can I give you a hug?

991
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:30,620
Big hug?

992
00:56:40,128 --> 00:56:41,563
- All right, um...
- The bickering is getting

993
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:44,000
very old, Harry.

994
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:45,902
That's just
the way it is, Miriam.

995
00:56:45,934 --> 00:56:48,438
Maybe we should just not let him
work here anymore, okay?

996
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:49,639
- Because we're not helping him.
- Now, come on.

997
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:53,476
Robert might be a father
next week.

998
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:54,911
Yeah.

999
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:56,778
I think I'm depressed.

1000
00:56:56,811 --> 00:56:58,580
You're not depressed, Harry.

1001
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:01,050
You're alone.
There's a difference.

1002
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,152
Yeah. Okay.

1003
00:57:03,184 --> 00:57:05,153
Look, I know
I brought this on myself,

1004
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:07,706
- but it is nothing to it that...
- Not my problem anymore, Harry.

1005
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,596
Harry, Ms. Walsh
is here to see you.

1006
00:57:13,628 --> 00:57:15,931
Is that...?

1007
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,733
Yeah, maybe we should
do this another time.

1008
00:57:18,766 --> 00:57:20,635
Just send her in, please.

1009
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:21,937
You got it.

1010
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,718
Oh, my god.
You motherfucker.

1011
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,653
Hey, let's not have
name-calling.

1012
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:39,655
- Oh, just blow it out your ass.
- Okay.

1013
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:51,666
Hi. I'm Miriam.

1014
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:53,602
- Harry's wife.
- Hi.

1015
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:56,271
Sara-Beth.
Nice to meet you.

1016
00:57:56,304 --> 00:58:00,643
- I am very sorry. I...
- No. No. No. Nope. Nope.

1017
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:03,645
Men are dogs. I did not
come here for an apology.

1018
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,215
I came here to meet you
and your wonderful daughter.

1019
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:07,817
I just wanted to say...

1020
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:12,888
Thank you.
By the way, that one's

1021
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:16,893
pretty wonderful, too.

1022
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:18,226
Would you like
to get some dinner?

1023
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,229
- I would love that.
- Sounds great. Let's go.

1024
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:22,832
No, you're not invited, Harry.

1025
00:58:22,864 --> 00:58:24,299
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1026
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,601
- Girls' night?
- Mm-hmm.

1027
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:26,635
- Just like that?
- Yes.

1028
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:29,271
Okay.

1029
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:32,207
Robert, Mason, and I will

1030
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,110
- do stuff that's fun.
- Good.

1031
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:41,017
Is this man party

1032
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,952
To this evil plot, Chipmunk?

1033
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:52,327
Why are you not watching
the movie?

1034
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,196
I have it on tape, so.

1035
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,867
Aw, poor chipmunk.

1036
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,769
Speechless in my presence.

1037
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:02,804
What say you, sir?
Don't try my patience.

1038
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,574
I... I don't know
what you're talking.

1039
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:07,677
I seek a beautiful girl,
my other half, my one...

1040
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,112
This is my kind of night:
beer and Chinese food.

1041
00:59:10,144 --> 00:59:13,114
Mm-hmm.
You like it?

1042
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:15,617
I love it.
It's excellent.

1043
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,153
We're longtime customers there.

1044
00:59:18,186 --> 00:59:20,288
Harry took me there
on our first date.

1045
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:21,791
Me, too!

1046
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:27,797
Okay! Got me.

1047
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,206
It's been a while since I sat
through one of those.

1048
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:55,291
There you go.

1049
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:58,693
Under the covers.

1050
00:59:58,726 --> 01:00:00,096
Okay?

1051
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:06,836
How about if I read you a book?

1052
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,104
Here we go.

1053
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:16,945
"Come see the amazing
diving horse."

1054
01:00:16,978 --> 01:00:19,648
No. I want both of you.

1055
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,655
All right.

1056
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:26,823
Okay.

1057
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:35,130
"A long, long time ago,
in a city quite close,

1058
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:39,702
the brave young horse
with a long brown nose.

1059
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:43,806
His name was
Dale the Diving Horse

1060
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:48,943
and he was quite famous,
of course.

1061
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:15,971
So what if they took
your photos down?

1062
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:19,375
Two weeks in a serious gallery.

1063
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:20,809
Yeah, 3 years ago.

1064
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:32,422
How are things with Sara-Beth?

1065
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:37,992
It's okay to be worried.

1066
01:01:38,025 --> 01:01:40,328
I don't even...
I don't even know yet.

1067
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:45,967
Oh.

1068
01:01:58,914 --> 01:02:00,516
- What?
- This is your new work?

1069
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:03,018
Oh, you jerk. No.

1070
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,753
No, those are Mason's.

1071
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:05,788
Oh.

1072
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:09,025
Sweet. I was wondering.

1073
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,064
I was thinking
of teaching the kids

1074
01:02:15,097 --> 01:02:18,267
a class on photography.

1075
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,869
That's a good idea.

1076
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:24,038
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1077
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:25,074
You're not just saying that?
You're sure?

1078
01:02:25,106 --> 01:02:27,476
No. I wouldn't just say that.

1079
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:31,112
- All right.
- I mean it.

1080
01:02:31,146 --> 01:02:32,848
- I do.
- Let's go.

1081
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,050
Let's get outta here.
I've seen enough.

1082
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,923
- Where are we eatin'?
- I don't know.

1083
01:02:40,956 --> 01:02:42,557
You know the neighborhood,
right?

1084
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:45,493
Okay, so this is your LLC,

1085
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:48,230
okay? It allows for
pass-through taxation,

1086
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:50,199
which is great,
'cause it's an easy thing.

1087
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:52,333
- Okay.
- It protects you and Harry

1088
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:54,903
from being personally liable,
you know,

1089
01:02:54,936 --> 01:02:58,007
- should the worst thing happen.
- Right.

1090
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:01,476
This is your number
and that is his number.

1091
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,379
- So we're separate?
- Yeah, totally.

1092
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:07,048
- Okay.
- It's really just pretty basic.

1093
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:08,483
Yeah, it's scaring me
'cause I actually think

1094
01:03:08,516 --> 01:03:10,152
- I understand it.
- Yeah, of course.

1095
01:03:10,184 --> 01:03:12,020
So maybe I don't,
entirely, but.

1096
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,889
No, no, no.
I think you got it.

1097
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:18,427
Okay. What do you do?
You're not an accountant.

1098
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:23,231
Um, I raise capital to purchase
intellectual properties.

1099
01:03:23,264 --> 01:03:24,465
- Very fancy.
- Yeah, no no no,

1100
01:03:24,498 --> 01:03:26,301
it's very fancy.

1101
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,871
Well, you will get
a free pair of cowboy boots

1102
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:31,340
When it's all said and done.

1103
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,441
- Right.
- Hey!

1104
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:34,410
- Hey.
- Hey.

1105
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,211
What's goin' on?

1106
01:03:36,244 --> 01:03:39,547
Oh, I was just talking with
Lenny about my new business.

1107
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:41,916
Yeah.

1108
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:44,319
Where's Mason?

1109
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:50,125
Um, she stayed late at school
and then Harry took her.

1110
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:51,827
Just hangin' out.

1111
01:04:00,434 --> 01:04:01,938
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

1112
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:16,085
Hi.

1113
01:04:16,117 --> 01:04:17,219
Hey.

1114
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:26,028
Are you mad at me?

1115
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:30,231
No, you're working
all the angles, right?

1116
01:04:30,264 --> 01:04:31,933
Robert.

1117
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,936
You know,
you get me to babysit,

1118
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:35,503
have my dad give you money
and pay your rent.

1119
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:36,936
You're gonna fuck one
of my friends.

1120
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:38,940
Robert.

1121
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:40,442
Come on, I was calling him
because I wanted

1122
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:43,045
to ask him advice
on setting up my business.

1123
01:04:43,077 --> 01:04:44,480
I don't want to do everything
with your father.

1124
01:04:44,512 --> 01:04:47,115
Right, 'cause Lenny's
brilliant sexual theory

1125
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:48,483
has nothing to do with this.

1126
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:52,388
Are you serious?

1127
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:01,496
Look...

1128
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,365
I... I'm sorry.

1129
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:07,568
I'm sorry. It's just there's
a lot going on at once.

1130
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:08,904
I'm sorry.

1131
01:05:15,543 --> 01:05:17,545
Do you want to help me
tomorrow with Tosh?

1132
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:23,686
Sure.

1133
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,155
You can bring stuff over
to the shoot tomorrow

1134
01:05:27,188 --> 01:05:29,391
and I can introduce you to him.

1135
01:05:29,423 --> 01:05:31,460
I'm more interested
in just helping you.

1136
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:25,447
Hey.

1137
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,215
About last night.

1138
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:28,349
What?

1139
01:06:28,382 --> 01:06:29,684
Fine.
Don't worry about it.

1140
01:06:29,717 --> 01:06:33,321
Okay. Good.
Just 'cause I feel like we,

1141
01:06:33,355 --> 01:06:35,123
you know,
have a real connection.

1142
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:41,230
Furthermore, I think
she might be feeling smothered

1143
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:42,797
- by you and Harry.
- Will you stop talking, Lenny?

1144
01:06:42,831 --> 01:06:44,599
What? I'm just saying
that there could be

1145
01:06:44,632 --> 01:06:46,567
some objectification at play,
some sort of nascent...

1146
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:50,304
Robert.

1147
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:21,769
Great.

1148
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:23,237
Come down.

1149
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:24,640
Stylist!

1150
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:30,679
What is this, exactly?

1151
01:07:30,711 --> 01:07:32,748
Hey. You all right?

1152
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:35,250
Hey. Yeah,
I cannot keep up with this.

1153
01:07:35,282 --> 01:07:39,253
Thank you so much
for bringing this.

1154
01:07:39,286 --> 01:07:41,823
Oh, shit! Oh, god.

1155
01:07:41,856 --> 01:07:44,326
These are all the wrong size.
They got me the wrong size.

1156
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:46,862
- Oh, god.
- Stylist.

1157
01:07:46,894 --> 01:07:48,563
- Yes.
- Do you want me to...?

1158
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,865
- I can take them 'em back.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

1159
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,567
- It's fine.
- No, it's fine. I can just

1160
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,800
- It's not a problem.
- Clamp it in the back

1161
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,203
- or something.
- Hey, what's the holdup?

1162
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,439
Oh, yes, I just
have to pin the underwear.

1163
01:07:57,472 --> 01:08:01,710
Mr. Wolfe, I just want to say
I really admire your work.

1164
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:03,344
Let's go.

1165
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:05,219
He's actually a really
talented photographer.

1166
01:08:05,246 --> 01:08:06,815
I only have it for 30 minutes.
Let's go.

1167
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:10,585
- Now, now.
- Okay, that's my cue. Bye.

1168
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:14,690
Talk to you later.

1169
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:17,292
Okay, hurry.

1170
01:08:17,324 --> 01:08:19,260
- And you didn't tell me.
- Hmm?

1171
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:20,828
- Dinner.
- Yes.

1172
01:08:20,862 --> 01:08:23,765
Sara. Did it
freak her out or...?

1173
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:25,166
- Did...?
- What'd you do to her?

1174
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,667
I didn't...
Did I freak her out?

1175
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:29,304
- Yeah.
- No, she's in her 20s.

1176
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:32,574
She's appropriately
freaked out, Harry.

1177
01:08:32,606 --> 01:08:36,411
Yeah. Yeah, well.

1178
01:08:36,444 --> 01:08:38,647
- Say, "cheese."
- Ohhh.

1179
01:08:41,248 --> 01:08:42,818
Cheese.

1180
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:00,635
- And cereal is milk, right?
- Yeah.

1181
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:02,470
Yes!
How many of you love milk?

1182
01:09:02,503 --> 01:09:06,240
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- Dr. Schnieder, please.

1183
01:09:06,274 --> 01:09:08,177
- Yes. Yes, yes.
- It's Robert.

1184
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,547
So, give away these bowls,
first, and then...

1185
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:14,750
Okay, okay.
So, so nothing. Yes.

1186
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,385
- Thanks.
- Right?

1187
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:18,452
Because too much milk,
what happens?

1188
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:20,189
- Soggy.
- Yes!

1189
01:09:20,221 --> 01:09:21,889
<i>And then, too little milk,
what happens?</i>

1190
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:23,492
- Dry.
- There you go.

1191
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:24,792
Just enough cereal.

1192
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,162
Very good.

1193
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,899
You got a bowl?

1194
01:09:30,931 --> 01:09:32,300
Did you get cereal?

1195
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:40,909
Hey.

1196
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:47,349
Fancy a drink?

1197
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:48,483
Sure.

1198
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:53,956
You're not my boss.

1199
01:09:53,988 --> 01:09:55,923
- Um...
- My boss fired me today.

1200
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:58,460
- Oh.
- So, that's what happened there.

1201
01:09:58,493 --> 01:10:00,596
It was a rough day?

1202
01:10:00,628 --> 01:10:03,564
Yeah, man. Tosh is...

1203
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:05,801
I don't think I've met
a bigger jerk than that guy.

1204
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:08,403
He's an idiot.

1205
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:10,338
You haven't.

1206
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,609
Unfortunately, that's
how it goes in my industry.

1207
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:15,409
What better reason
to start your own line?

1208
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:17,246
Yeah.

1209
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,549
That is exactly
what your dad said.

1210
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:23,452
Can we please not talk
about him today?

1211
01:10:23,484 --> 01:10:26,954
Robert. Be nice.

1212
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:28,657
He's savin' my ass.

1213
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:33,596
That's good.

1214
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:43,765
My parents are really upset
that Mason and I left.

1215
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:47,476
- They invested a lot in her.
- Uh-huh.

1216
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,877
- And they helped me raise her.
- Yeah.

1217
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:52,913
They really don't want either
of us to live in New York.

1218
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:57,351
You... You're... you're an adult.
They can't...

1219
01:10:57,385 --> 01:11:01,722
Do they know
about Harry and me?

1220
01:11:01,756 --> 01:11:05,027
Um, no.

1221
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,495
I mean,

1222
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,498
- I just told them Harry Lang.
- Mm-hmm.

1223
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:15,304
To parents.

1224
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,617
I have a weird question
for you.

1225
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:18,006
What?

1226
01:11:18,038 --> 01:11:20,675
Would you say that you
like my hair better now?

1227
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:21,909
I don't. I...

1228
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,578
Or did you like it
better before?

1229
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:26,347
I don't know. I like it.
I liked it both ways.

1230
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:27,615
It's nice. You know?

1231
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,623
- No. No, no, no, no. No.
- Huh?

1232
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,692
No.

1233
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:53,975
Sara?

1234
01:11:56,077 --> 01:11:57,378
Sara!

1235
01:12:04,985 --> 01:12:07,588
No.

1236
01:12:07,622 --> 01:12:11,026
- What?
- Did we...?

1237
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:14,730
No, no!

1238
01:12:14,762 --> 01:12:17,466
Well, I mean,
there was the cab, but.

1239
01:12:17,498 --> 01:12:20,469
- No memory.
- No.

1240
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,570
Where's Mason?

1241
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:25,474
Uhhh, at Harry's.
Relax!

1242
01:12:25,506 --> 01:12:26,741
Shit!

1243
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:41,390
Nothing happened, okay?

1244
01:12:46,027 --> 01:12:47,429
- Hey. Hey, Miriam.
- Hi.

1245
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:49,164
- Where's Mason?
- Joyce picked her up

1246
01:12:49,197 --> 01:12:51,400
and brought her to school.

1247
01:12:51,432 --> 01:12:52,900
Where have you two been?

1248
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:01,542
Did you two
spend the night together?

1249
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:02,711
Yeah. We...

1250
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,916
Wow.

1251
01:13:11,985 --> 01:13:13,854
You know, every time I put
a little faith in you, Robert,

1252
01:13:13,887 --> 01:13:18,059
you do something
that makes me lose it.

1253
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:19,493
All right, you know
what'd be good?

1254
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:20,888
A life for Mason
without you in it.

1255
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,999
Okay, that...
Just stop it, all right?

1256
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:27,135
You know what? I have to...
I have to lie down.

1257
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:28,670
I just can't.

1258
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:29,971
Yeah, well,
the doctor appointment

1259
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:31,873
is at 12:00 noon,
if anyone's interested.

1260
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:39,414
Unbelievable.

1261
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:19,054
Dad.

1262
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:21,857
What? He's not here.

1263
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,793
Oh, looks like a full house.

1264
01:14:24,826 --> 01:14:27,596
Oh, how was the, uh,
vacation, Miriam?

1265
01:14:27,628 --> 01:14:29,130
Fine.

1266
01:14:29,162 --> 01:14:32,199
- Good week, Robert?
- No.

1267
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:36,037
Okay, so, we can get on
with this, right? Yeah.

1268
01:14:36,069 --> 01:14:37,072
Ahem!

1269
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:38,604
So,

1270
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:44,512
Mason's father is

1271
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:45,681
Harry Lang.

1272
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:10,005
Hey, listen.
I need to take a walk, so,

1273
01:15:10,037 --> 01:15:11,839
I will pick up dinner.

1274
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:14,842
I will see you guys back
at the apartment.

1275
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:18,246
What about Mason?

1276
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:21,583
Well, Joyce is gonna
pick her up. It's covered.

1277
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,003
Are you hungry?
We're starving.

1278
01:15:42,036 --> 01:15:44,806
Um, no.

1279
01:15:44,838 --> 01:15:47,275
You have to go,
talk to her, now.

1280
01:15:50,677 --> 01:15:52,613
Okay.

1281
01:15:52,646 --> 01:15:54,916
Hey, Mason.

1282
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:58,586
Uh, Aunt Miriam's gonna look
after you for a second, okay?

1283
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:00,956
- Aunt?
- You got something better?

1284
01:16:06,894 --> 01:16:08,630
You got something
better than aunt?

1285
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,104
- Hey.
- Hey.

1286
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:19,807
- Where you goin'?
- I'm goin' home to Tennessee.

1287
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:23,178
I... I can't do this, okay?

1288
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,646
This isn't gonna work out.
Can't do this.

1289
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,818
You could just tell Mason
that we're all family.

1290
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,819
But Harry doesn't even
wanna do this,

1291
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:33,887
I can't keep letting Mason down,

1292
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:35,657
I can't keep running away
from my parents,

1293
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:37,091
and I don't belong here.

1294
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:41,061
All right. I get it.

1295
01:16:41,095 --> 01:16:43,331
But you're wrong about Harry.
He's just scared.

1296
01:16:43,363 --> 01:16:46,032
I can talk to him.

1297
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:47,702
We'll figure this out, okay?

1298
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:51,773
Don't go anywhere yet.
All right?

1299
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:26,006
Hey, Dad. Um,
hope you're all right.

1300
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:28,676
So, Sara-Beth was saying
that she might be

1301
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,413
heading back to Tennessee.

1302
01:17:31,445 --> 01:17:33,081
So, you know,
it might be a good time

1303
01:17:33,113 --> 01:17:38,252
to give her a call,
stop by the house, whatever.

1304
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:08,048
Look, I'm sorry about Sara.

1305
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:09,884
It's just we get along.

1306
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:14,489
- She understands the process.
- It's okay.

1307
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:16,757
Do you wanna get a coffee
and talk about it, or...?

1308
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:19,027
Later, man.
I gotta talk to my dad.

1309
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,496
I just feel like we have
something worth exploring.

1310
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:23,031
- Dude.
- It's fine, Lenny.

1311
01:18:23,064 --> 01:18:24,266
We'll talk later.

1312
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:54,028
There he is.

1313
01:18:56,463 --> 01:18:58,399
- Busted!
- A little bit.

1314
01:18:58,431 --> 01:19:00,934
Wow.

1315
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:04,805
So, I guess the word is
I'm a big coward now, huh?

1316
01:19:04,838 --> 01:19:06,073
Never said that.

1317
01:19:06,106 --> 01:19:08,243
Robert, I judge people.

1318
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:10,110
I judged you.

1319
01:19:10,144 --> 01:19:13,515
I still judge you and I don't
wanna do that to Mason.

1320
01:19:13,547 --> 01:19:16,784
Then don't. Don't.

1321
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,052
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

1322
01:19:19,086 --> 01:19:22,157
<i>Truth is, you would be
a better father to her.</i>

1323
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:23,957
- No, you don't know that.
- Sure I do.

1324
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,060
- You don't.
- Yeah, I do.

1325
01:19:26,092 --> 01:19:28,829
I mean, you're a natural
with kids.

1326
01:19:28,863 --> 01:19:31,466
I grew up in a preschool.

1327
01:19:31,498 --> 01:19:32,833
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1328
01:19:36,904 --> 01:19:39,808
Dad, Dad, you're all right.

1329
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:42,210
As a father, you are.

1330
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:45,346
And all right's pretty good.

1331
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:55,956
Just help me out
with this fathering thing.

1332
01:19:55,989 --> 01:19:57,958
- You got it.
- Sorry, we're closed.

1333
01:19:57,992 --> 01:19:59,327
- You got it.
- No, but thank you.

1334
01:20:03,296 --> 01:20:04,998
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yes.

1335
01:20:05,032 --> 01:20:07,836
Lenny.

1336
01:20:07,868 --> 01:20:11,371
- Yes! Yes.
- What?

1337
01:20:11,404 --> 01:20:13,307
We need a bigger table.

1338
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,877
- Why?
- Miriam!

1339
01:20:15,909 --> 01:20:17,612
- How are you?
- Good.

1340
01:20:17,645 --> 01:20:19,981
- Hi.
- Hello.

1341
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:21,449
Sara-Beth.

1342
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:24,219
Mason, throw some of those
noodles on top of there.

1343
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,487
That is disgusting.

1344
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,524
You're gonna start sweating and
the whole place is gonna stink.

1345
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:36,998
- Are you done?
- I got a spicy thing before.

1346
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,131
- Yeah, what was that?
- Yeah, what was that like?

1347
01:20:38,164 --> 01:20:40,033
- What?!
- Come on.

1348
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:42,302
Hey, Robert.

1349
01:20:42,336 --> 01:20:45,373
- Did you show your dad?
- The, uh, the pictures?

1350
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:48,475
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. Um.

1351
01:20:48,509 --> 01:20:50,612
I was telling Mom.
Look at these.

1352
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:52,547
I was hoping to maybe

1353
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:56,317
start a photography class
for the kids.

1354
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,186
Wow, yeah.

1355
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:01,055
It's, um, it's avant-garde.

1356
01:21:01,087 --> 01:21:02,289
- Yep.
- That's right.

1357
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:05,026
They're Mason's,
you realize, right?

1358
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:07,128
Yeah. It's not a bad idea,
actually. This is good work.

1359
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:12,300
Good idea. I've never had
a bad idea, right?

1360
01:21:12,332 --> 01:21:14,368
Lenny.

1361
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:17,038
Are... are you guys serious?

1362
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:20,173
I don't mind. It's just
I... I don't see it.

1363
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:23,612
- Harry, let it go.
- We're grownups.

1364
01:21:26,713 --> 01:21:29,484
Listen, I have to say
something. Uh...

1365
01:21:29,516 --> 01:21:31,117
You should make
an announcement, Harry.

1366
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:38,927
This time around,
I'm going to be...

1367
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,462
I'm going to be there.
I'm going to be present

1368
01:21:41,494 --> 01:21:45,532
for everyone in this family.

1369
01:21:45,565 --> 01:21:50,137
Mason and everybody.

1370
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,244
All right,
take a step back, okay?

1371
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:57,645
Don't cover the flash.

1372
01:21:57,677 --> 01:22:00,414
I'm not gonna cover the fl...
cover the flash.

1373
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:01,983
All right, everybody,
get together.

1374
01:22:02,015 --> 01:22:04,719
- You ready?
- Okay, crew, smile.

1375
01:22:04,752 --> 01:22:07,021
C'mon, everybody. Ready.

1376
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:08,056
- Is that a smile, Harry?
- Yeah.

1377
01:22:08,088 --> 01:22:12,393
All right. 1, 2, 3.

1378
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:14,729
Got it.

1379
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:17,631
- So I gotta go.
- Where you going?

1380
01:22:17,664 --> 01:22:19,399
I got things to do.

1381
01:22:19,432 --> 01:22:20,600
Why don't you
come back with us?

1382
01:22:20,634 --> 01:22:23,404
Nah, no.
Um, hey, Mason,

1383
01:22:23,436 --> 01:22:25,672
you gonna go home
with your old man?

1384
01:22:25,706 --> 01:22:29,210
<i>- But I want you to be my dad.
- You've got a dad.</i>

1385
01:22:29,243 --> 01:22:30,645
He's your dad.

1386
01:22:30,677 --> 01:22:32,046
- How about a brother?
- Yeah.

1387
01:22:32,078 --> 01:22:38,078
You want a brother?
Okay, deal.

1388
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:40,021
¶ I traveled the world ¶
