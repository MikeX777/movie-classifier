00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,800
- I NEEDED SOMETHING NEW.
- HMM.

179
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,067
- MARC HATES SHOPPING
WITH ME.

180
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,067
- I DO NOT.

181
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,467
- DAVID DOESN'T MIND,

182
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,233
AS LONG AS THERE ARE
OTHER WOMEN TO WATCH.

183
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,767
- EXACTLY.

184
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,500
YOU LOVE IT WHEN I LOOK
AT OTHER WOMEN.

185
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,400
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
- WHAT?

186
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:28,133
- DEPENDS ON THE STORE,
DOESN'T IT?

187
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,200
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

188
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:33,133
- YOU ARE SUCH A BAD BOY.

189
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,800
- OH YEAH?
- YEAH.

190
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,267
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

191
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,500
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT?

192
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:40,400
- PUNISH YOU.
- OH, GOOD. CAN'T WAIT.

193
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:43,300
- BET YOU CAN'T.
- UH-HUH.

194
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,300
(KISSING)

195
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,067
I THINK WE'RE BEING RUDE.

196
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,600
DO YOU GUYS WANT ME TO HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING OVER THERE?

197
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,800
- NO, NO, IT'S FINE.
I'M JUST, UH--

198
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,233
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

199
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,033
- GOOD? THIS IS FINE
WITH YOU GUYS?

200
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,633
- OH, MY GOD.

201
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:59,100
- YOU'RE SO BAD.

202
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,600
I GUESS WE'RE STILL IN OUR
HONEYMOON PHASE.

203
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,800
GOT TO ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

204
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,433
- TRUE.

205
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:08,567
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO KNOWN
EACH OTHER?

206
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,267
- UM, WE MET ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
- YEAR AGO.

207
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,533
- BUT WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER,
SO IT KIND OF JUST, DIDN'T--

208
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:21,167
THEN WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER A
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, SO...

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,767
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A HONEYMOON.

210
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,233
- REMEMBER THAT?
- WHAT?

211
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:27,567
- THE HONEYMOON.

212
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,333
- UH. SO TIGHT.

213
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,567
- HONEYMOON.
VAGUELY.

214
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,800
- CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN.

215
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,133
GOD, EVERYTHING HAPPENED
SO FAST FOR US.

216
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,400
ONE MINUTE WE MET, THE NEXT,
WE WERE MARRIED.

217
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,600
- YEAH. WELL, THAT'S DAVID.

218
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:46,800
HE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS. DOESN'T
NEED TO MESS AROUND, RIGHT?

219
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:51,167
STILL THE SAME WAY, THOUGH?
STILL STUBBORN?

220
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,633
- STUBBORN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

221
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,533
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

222
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,433
- I MEAN, HE'S DEFINITELY
CHANGED A LITTLE BIT.

223
00:10:57,467 --> 00:11:01,267
HE'S NOT AS, UH, I DON'T KNOW,
AGGRESSIVE AS HE USED TO BE.

224
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,700
- REALLY?
- WHAT?

225
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,367
- NO, I MEAN, IT'S NOT A BAD
THING. YOU'RE NOT.

226
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,033
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

227
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,300
- IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES
WITH AGE. MATURITY.

228
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,433
- OKAY, SO NOW I'M AN OLD MAN.
- SHUT UP.

229
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:15,367
- NO, WAIT, NOW I'M AN OLD,
UNAGGRESSIVE MAN.

230
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,067
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
STAY TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME?

231
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,200
MY ADVICE: DUMP HIM AFTER SIX
MONTHS. FIND A YOUNGER MODEL.

232
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,333
- DON'T GIVE HER ANY IDEAS.
- I PLAN ON IT.

233
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,800
- I'M SERIOUS. TRADE HIM IN.
- WHAT?

234
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,500
- HMM?
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

235
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,733
- I WAS KIDDING.

236
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,133
- THAT WASN'T FUNNY.

237
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,633
- DON'T.
- NO.

238
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,267
- NO?
- NO.

239
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,700
COME HERE, LITTLE GIRL.
DADDY WANTS TO TICKLE YOU.

240
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,333
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

241
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,667
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- NO! DON'T. DON'T.

242
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,200
OH!

243
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,033
OH, MY GOD.

244
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,133
- OH, DADDY WANTS TO...

245
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,467
I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

246
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,033
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SAY?

247
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,800
YOU WANT TO GET RID OF ME?

248
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,200
- STOP. STOP, MARC.
- DADDY NEEDS TO PUNISH YOU.

249
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,400
- NO, NO, NO. OH!

250
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,467
STOP. PLEASE.

251
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,233
- SORRY.

252
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,133
APOLOGIZE.

253
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:03,733
- SORRY.

254
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,600
- OKAY.

255
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,633
I FORGIVE YOU.

256
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,067
WHEN YOU SAY YOU WANT TO TRADE
ME FOR SOMEBODY ELSE,

257
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,633
IT MAKES ME FEEL INSECURE.

258
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,033
(BOTH LAUGHING)

259
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,133
DON'T GIVE HER ANY GODDAMN
IDEAS.

260
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,000
- OKAY.

261
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:23,200
- I LOVE YOU.
- REALLY? YOU DO?

262
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,800
- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO SAY.

263
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:30,133
- OH! SHIT. I ALWAYS
FORGET MY LINES.

264
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,733
OKAY. I REMEMBER.

265
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,367
UM, I LOVE YOU, TOO.

266
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,033
- THAT'S PERFECT.

267
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,733
YOU WANT TO GO FOR
A WALK ON THE BEACH?

268
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,067
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

269
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,667
- YEAH.

270
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,500
- WAIT.
I HAVE AN IDEA.

271
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,633
WHY DON'T YOU LADIES

272
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,533
GO FOR A NICE LEISURELY STROLL
ON THE BEACH

273
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:53,467
WHILE US GENTLEMEN PREPARE
THE FISH FOR GRILLING?

274
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,533
AND WE'LL MAKE A NICE BIG SALAD
AND, UM, UM...

275
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,633
WHATEVER THE HELL ELSE YOU GOT.
WHAT'D YOU GET?

276
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,633
- ASPARAGUS.
- YES.

277
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:06,200
WELL, WE'LL MAKE THAT, TOO.
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

278
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,533
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
DAVID?

279
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,667
- UH, YEAH, SURE.
FINE WITH ME.

280
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,367
- LET ME JUST GRAB MY HAT.

281
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,100
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME, TOO.

282
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:19,100
YOU GENTS WORK WHILE US LADIES
TAKE A LEISURELY STROLL.

283
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,500
- YEAH, AND JUST
TAKE YOUR TIME.

284
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,533
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO
THIS GUY, CATHERINE,

285
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,367
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO
ACCOMMODATING.

286
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,467
- OH, REALLY, JULIE?
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

287
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,300
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY
I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN
SUCH A NICE GENTLEMAN?

288
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,233
- NO, I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.
TRUCE.

289
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,033
- WHERE ARE YOUR GLASSES?

290
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:36,700
- IN MY BAG.
- SHOULD COVER YOUR FACE.

291
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,500
THERE YOU ARE, DARLING.

292
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,367
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

293
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
NOW GO DO THE GIRL-TALK
THING.

294
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:52,067
- YOU'RE SO CHAUVINISTIC.
- YEAH.

295
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,200
- HE IS A--
- OW.

296
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:02,167
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH. I'M FINE.

297
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,333
- OKAY. BYE.

298
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,667
- BYE.

299
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,767
- WE WILL RETURN.
- YES.

300
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,033
- DON'T BREAK ANYTHING.
- I WON'T.

301
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:23,367
SHE REALLY IS A HANDFUL.

302
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,400
- YOU SEEM TO BE MANAGING
PRETTY WELL.

303
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:31,067
- YEAH, WELL, WHAT THE HELL ELSE
AM I GONNA DO?

304
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,500
(GROANS)
HOW...HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

305
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:38,233
- UH, GOOD. YEAH, YOU KNOW.
I CAN'T COMPLAIN.

306
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:41,200
LOOKING AFTER THINGS, TAKING
CARE OF THE BUSINESS.

307
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:44,033
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THE RESTAURANT. FUCK.

308
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:47,367
I'M SO SORRY THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN THERE TO TASTE IT,

309
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,800
BUT I HEAR IT'S GOING GOOD.

310
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,267
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GOOD. IT'S DOING WELL.

311
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,133
WE GOT A COUPLE WRITE-UPS WHICH
DOESN'T HURT THINGS, SO--

312
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,200
- OKAY, YEAH. SO YOU GOT, UM,

313
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,800
YOU GOT SOMEONE DOING
PR FOR YOU.

314
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,567
- OH, YEAH, YOU HAVE TO.

315
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,333
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO GET
WRITTEN UP...

316
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,700
- YEAH.
- BUT IT'S GOOD.

317
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,500
I MEAN, HOPEFULLY IT KEEPS
GETTING BETTER.

318
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,400
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE PACKED
EVERY NIGHT.

319
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:07,233
- SURE. YEAH.

320
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:09,067
- HOPEFULLY. SOON.

321
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,533
WE GOT A REALLY GREAT CHEF.

322
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:12,700
I MEAN, HE'S REALLY GOOD.

323
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:13,800
EXCELLENT DISHES.

324
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,800

325
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,333

326
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,667
- YEAH. YEAH.

00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,200

328
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,100
IT'S A LITTLE LIGHT,
BUT IT'S GOOD.

329
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,400
- OKAY.

330
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,500
- WE HAVE SOME BEER, TOO.

331
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,767
- NO, MAN.
WINE IS FINE.

332
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,200
- OKAY.

333
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
I'M SORRY. WERE YOU, UH,
GONNA ASK ME SOMETHING?

334
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:41,300
- UH, BEFORE OR--
- YEAH. I THOUGHT YOU, UH...

335
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,733
- OH, NO, IF I WAS,
I FORGET.

336
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,500
- OKAY.

337
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:53,767
- TO FRIENDS.

338
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,367
- TO FRIENDS.

339
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,067
- YEAH.

340
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,267
- SHE SEEMS REALLY NICE.

341
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,167
- SHE IS. YEAH.
UM...

342
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,333
I MEAN IT.
I MEAN, SHE'S GREAT.

343
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:15,633
I MEAN,
LOOK AT HER.

344
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,167
- THAT'S GREAT.

345
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,467
AND YOU AND JULIE SEEM

346
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,433
- YEAH, WE ARE.
YEAH, YOU KNOW--

347
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:24,233
WE GO THROUGH SOME THINGS
SOMETIMES, BUT...

348
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:27,600
I GUESS IF YOU CAN, UH,
STICK IT OUT OR,

349
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,700
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE TOLERATE--

350
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:32,367
THAT'S-- THAT'S NOT--

351
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,267
I THINK YOU JUST COME TO REALIZE
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT,

352
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,067
AND IF YOU DO, THEN THINGS ARE
PRETTY GOOD.

353
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,133
- YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.

354
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,667
THIS IS PRETTY LIGHT.

355
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,133
- YEAH.

356
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,300
- BUT IT'S GOOD, THOUGH.
I LIKE IT.

357
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,300
UM...

358
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,733
OKAY. SO...

359
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,167
DID YOU WANT TO DO THE FISH
OR--

360
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,300
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

361
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,800
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.

362
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,533
WHY DON'T WE JUST GET
THE SALAD READY

363
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,033
AND THEN WE CAN DO THAT LATER?

364
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,500
- ALL RIGHT.
- UM, SO, LET'S SEE.

365
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,100
I GOT A...

366
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,700
UH...

367
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:10,400
HOW ABOUT IF WE GET YOU SET UP
OVER HERE? YEAH.

368
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,567
- OKAY.

369
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,767
- I'LL GET A BOARD.

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,667
SET UP.

371
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,200
MAYBE SOME CARROTS TO GET
STARTED?

372
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,267
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.

373
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,333
UM. OH.
SOMETHING TO CUT IT WITH.

374
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,167
- YOU OKAY?

375
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,167
- YEAH. YEAH, I'M FINE.
I JUST, UH...

376
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,633
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

377
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,533
- ME, TOO.

378
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,267
- YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE, UH...

379
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,700
DIFFERENT NOW WITH...

380
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,733
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

381
00:17:55,767 --> 00:18:00,433
- YEAH.
NO, I KNOW.

382
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:02,700
(CHOPPING)

383
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,200
- DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

384
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,500
- LOOK AT YOU LIKE WHAT?

385
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,533
- MARC, COME ON.
IT'S JUST--

386
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:16,033
- HEY, I SAID OKAY, YOU KNOW?
I UNDERSTAND.

387
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,500
- WELL, IT'S NOT THAT
I HAVEN'T, UH...

388
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,700
I JUST...

389
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

390
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,600
- NOT DOING ANYTHING.

391
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:35,033
- MARC, STOP.
- STOP WHAT?

392
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,733
- COME ON, REALLY.

393
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,167
- YOU NEED TO RELAX.

394
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,367
THIS IS WHAT MARRIAGE
DOES TO YOU?

395
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,500
- DON'T SAY THAT.
- I'M KIDDING.

396
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,233
(CHOPPING)

397
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:50,700
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

398
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,233
- WHAT DON'T I UNDERSTAND?

399
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,500
HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

400
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,200
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.

401
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,300
- RIGHT. YEAH. YOU NEVER DO
ANYTHING, DO YOU?

402
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,000
- WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

403
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:06,800
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU DID SOMETHING?

404
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,067
I MEAN REALLY DID SOMETHING
YOU FELT GOOD ABOUT.

405
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,400
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

406
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,433
I DO THINGS ALL THE TIME
THAT I FEEL REALLY--

407
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,700
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THIS
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE.

408
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,367
I THOUGHT WE COULD JUST--

409
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,433
- THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.
IT'S NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE.

410
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,433
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT--

411
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,100
- THEN DON'T DO THAT.

412
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,700
DON'T START ACTING LIKE YOU'RE
ALL BETTER THAN ME

413
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:27,133
JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT YOUR NICE
LITTLE FANCY BEACH HOUSE,

414
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,333
YOUR NICE LITTLE--
YOU KNOW, FORGET IT.

415
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

416
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,667
- I'M GOING TO GO
FIND CATHERINE.

417
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,367
- MARC, WAIT.
COME ON, COME ON.

418
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,167
COME ON.

419
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,233
COME ON, YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN THAT.

420
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,333
- YEAH, I THOUGHT I DID.

421
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,467
- COME ON, DON'T DO THAT.
YOU KNOW YOU DO.

422
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,367
I DON'T THINK I'M BETTER.

423
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
AND I'M HAPPIER HERE,
I AM.

424
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:51,200
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

425
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,667
COME ON.

426
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,100
TRUCE?

427
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,767
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

428
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,033
- WHAT AM I DOING?

429
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,300
- WHAT DID YOU COME HERE FOR?

430
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,433
- DAVID--
- WHY?

431
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:23,600
- THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ALL DRAMATIC, OKAY?

432
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,600
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE
SOME FUN, YOU KNOW?

433
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:26,633
REMEMBER FUN?

434
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,133
- YEAH, I DO.

435
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,800
- LOOK, LET'S JUST
MAKE DINNER,

436
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,333
WE'LL ENJOY OURSELVES,

437
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:35,367
AND CATHERINE AND I
WILL TAKE OFF, OKAY?

438
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,533
(SIGHS)

439
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,667
(CRUNCHING)

440
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,533
YOU KNOW ME.

441
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,600
YEAH, I TAKE WHAT I CAN.

442
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,500
BUT I DON'T BULLY PEOPLE.

443
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,533
IF YOU DON'T,

444
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,433
IT'S OKAY.

445
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,500
(CHOPPING)

446
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,067
- OH!
- HA HA! NICE SHOT.

447
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,067
- HA HA.
THANK YOU.

448
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,733
FEELS GOOD, MAN.

449
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:31,467
HAVEN'T PLAYED IN...
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

450
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,733
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

451
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,467
YOU AND JULIE PLAY MUCH?

452
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,167
- NO, NOT REALLY.
SHE GETS TIRED.

453
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,100
- GOOD MORNING!

454
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,667
- MORNING.
- HOW YOU FEELING?

455
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,733
- UGH.

456
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:56,533
- CATHERINE STILL SLEEPING?

457
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,700
- NO, SHE, UM...

458
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:01,067
SHE WENT INTO TOWN.
SHE'S SEEING...

459
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,167
SHE'S SEEING AN OLD FRIEND.

460
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:23,400
- OH!
NICE HUSTLE.

461
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,800
- YOU READY TO START
KEEPING SCORE?

462
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,133
- (PANTING)
YEAH, SURE.

463
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,200
- YOU DON'T WANT TO?

464
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,733
- NO, IT'S FINE.
I SAID SURE.

465
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,433
- I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.
- SO COME ON.

466
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:41,133
- NO, IT'S FINE.
THIS IS FINE.

467
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,567
- IF YOU WANT TO KEEP SCORE,
WE KEEP SCORE.

468
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,133
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO
ARGUING ABOUT?

469
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,600
- WE'RE NOT ARGUING.
MARC HAS THIS THING.

470
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,800
WHAT IS IT,
A PHILOSOPHY--

471
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,500
- YOU LIKE DOING THIS,
DON'T YOU.

472
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,467
- I'M ASKING.
- DOES HE DO THIS TO YOU, TOO?

473
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,733
- I AM ASKING.
IS IT A PHILOSOPHY?

474
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,400
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING.

475
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:57,033
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
- TRYING TO EMBARRASS--

476
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,467
- DON'T--
- TRY TO--

477
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,333
- FORGET IT.
LET'S JUST KEEP PLAYING.

478
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,067
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

479
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,367
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
KEEPING SCORE.

480
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,633
- FUNNY.

481
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,200
- NICE TO SEE SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

482
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,800
- DON'T PUT ME IN WITH HIM.

483
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,733
HE'S THE ONE.
I'VE CHANGED.

484
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,600
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WILL TAKE THAT AS A
COMPLIMENT.

485
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:17,133
I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE.

486
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,433
- I'M GOING TO TAKE A SHOWER.
PLAY NICE.

487
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,700
- STILL THE SAME.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

488
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,000
- (LAUGHING)

489
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,267
**

490
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:35,333
- * ANY TIME YOU LIKE

491
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:38,200
* WE CAN MEET AGAIN, BABY

492
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,633
* AND AS TIME GOES BY

493
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:43,633
* WELL, YOU MUST REMEMBER

494
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:47,067
* HOW IT FEELS TO LOVE

495
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,800
* WITHOUT CONDITION *

496
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,233
- DAVID WENT TO CHECK
ON THE BOAT.

497
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,200
- IS HE GONNA
TAKE IT OUT?

498
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:01,400
- NO, HE JUST LIKES
TO CHECK ON IT.

499
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:08,767
- I APPRECIATE YOU INVITING US
TO STAY LAST NIGHT.

500
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,067
- YOU BOTH HAD A LITTLE
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

501
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,433
- (CHUCKLES)

502
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:19,133
- WELL, IT'S NICE HAVING YOU.

503
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:23,400
YOU CAN TELL DAVID'S
HAPPIER HERE.

504
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:26,333
YOU, UH-- YOU HEARD FROM
CATHERINE?

505
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,067
- UM, SHE LEFT A MESSAGE.

506
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,467
- DOESN'T BOTHER YOU THAT SHE'S
SEEING AN OLD BOYFRIEND?

507
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,433
- NO.

508
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:41,800
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WE HAVE AN
UNDERSTANDING, YOU KNOW.

509
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:44,067
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

510
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,133
- WELL, I MEAN...

511
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,367
SHE DOES WHAT SHE
WANTS TO DO,

512
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,500
AND THEN I DO WHAT
I WANT TO DO.

513
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,100
- (SIGHS)
SOUNDS SIMPLE ENOUGH.

514
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,367
- YEAH.
IT WORKS.

515
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,500
- (EXHALES)

516
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,533
IT'S GETTING TOO HOT.

517
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,400
- HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

518
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,467
- WHAT WAS THAT?

519
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,367
- I SAID HOW HAVE YOU BEEN.

520
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,667
- GOOD.

521
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,067
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THINGS ARE GOOD.

522
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:45,600
HOW ABOUT YOU?

523
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:47,767
YOU DISAPPEARED FOR A WHILE.

524
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
- YEAH.

525
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:52,367
- WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

526
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,633
CORRUPTING YOUNG GIRLS?

527
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:01,033
- UH, DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING
YOU READ.

528
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,633
OR IS THAT WHAT DAVID'S BEEN
TELLING YOU?

529
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,633
- NO, HE WAS WONDERING
THE SAME.

530
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,133
- COULD HAVE CALLED.

531
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,200
- TRUE.
YES, WE COULD HAVE.

532
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:17,467
- NO, I SAID YOU
COULD HAVE CALLED.

533
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:22,400
- I ALMOST DID.

534
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,100
- YEAH?

535
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:30,667
- WHEN I WAS OUT IN L.A.,

536
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,167
I RAN INTO SOMEONE
WHO HAD SEEN YOU.

537
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,567
- SOMEONE WHO?

538
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,467
- I THINK IT WAS FRANK?

539
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,667
- OH, REALLY?
AND HOW IS FRANK?

540
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,267
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I DON'T
REALLY CARE.

541
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,500
YOU KNOW, FRANK'S THE KIND OF
PRODUCER

542
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:49,067
WHO COULDN'T PUT HIS MONEY WHERE
HIS MOUTH WAS, SO...

543
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME FOR
PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

544
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,133
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

545
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,500
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?

546
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,433
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS JUST...

547
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,767
- WELL, ISN'T THIS FUNNY?

548
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,267
- DON'T BE A JERK.

549
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,033
- I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS.

550
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,367
YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.

551
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,400
SORRY. MEANT TO SAY YOU LOOK
LIKE SHIT.

552
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:32,633
- (LAUGHING)

553
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,067
- MY BAD.

554
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,033
I WAS GONNA GO FOR
A LITTLE WALK ON THE BEACH

555
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:43,033
IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN ME.

556
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:47,067
- NO, THANKS.
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

557
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,300
- SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME?

558
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,733
- YEAH, I'M SURE.

559
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,733
**

560
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,600
* DO YOU REMEMBER

561
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:25,300
* WHAT IT FELT LIKE

562
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:30,000
* WHEN WE FELL IN LOVE?

563
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:36,467
* MY HANDS WENT WEAK
I LOST MY GRIP...*

564
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:49,800
* I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING...

565
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,333
* I'M SORRY

566
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:54,733
* YOU ARE MY REASON

567
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,367
- HEY!

568
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,267
- WANT A RIDE?
- SURE.

569
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,033
* YOU ARE MY ANGEL...*

570
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,033
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

571
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,800
- I WAS JUST CHECKING
ON MY BOAT.

572
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,300
- ARE YOU GOING TO
TAKE IT OUT?

573
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:31,100
- UM, NO. I MEAN, MAYBE.
I GUESS I COULD.

574
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:34,500
- I HAVEN'T BEEN SAILING
IN A LONG TIME.

575
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,467
I MISS IT.

576
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,633
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

577
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:43,033
AN OLD BOYFRIEND HAD
A LITTLE SCHOONER.

578
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:47,500
HAD THIS CUTE LITTLE PLACE ON
SHELTER ISLAND.

579
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:50,633
WE'D TAKE THE BOAT OUT JUST
ABOUT EVERY NIGHT,

580
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,533
JUST BEFORE THE SUNSET,

581
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:56,800
WATCH THE SUNSET
AND MAKE LOVE.

582
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,400
ALMOST EVERY NIGHT.

583
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:03,600
IT WAS FUN.

584
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,800
- SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

585
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,667
- WITH JOSH?

586
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,333
I DON'T KNOW.

587
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:12,167
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

588
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,233
WHAT HAPPENED?

589
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:18,633
I THINK...SUMMER ENDED,
AND I WAS MODELING AT THE TIME.

590
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,133
WENT AWAY FOR A FEW JOBS
AND...

591
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:24,333
I GUESS IT KIND OF JUST
FADED AWAY.

592
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:27,467
I DON'T REALLY
REMEMBER, THOUGH.

593
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,300
YOU KNOW, LIFE'S FUNNY
LIKE THAT.

594
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,600
IT'S SO HARD TO STAY IN TOUCH
WITH ALL THE PEOPLE YOU'VE MET

595
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,500
AND SPENT TIME WITH.

596
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:40,600
MAYBE-- MAYBE EVEN PEOPLE YOU'VE
SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME WITH.

597
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:43,033
PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT
OF YOUR LIFE,

598
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:45,700
YOU GO IN AND OUT OF
THEIR LIVES AND...

599
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:49,567
IT ALL JUST SEEMS SO RANDOM AT
TIMES, YOU KNOW?

600
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,733
I HAD THIS ONE BOYFRIEND ONCE.

601
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,567
HE WORKED SO HARD TO FIND
THE MEANING IN THINGS.

602
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,567
IT WAS LIKE, EVERYTHING WAS
FOR A REASON.

603
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,300
HE USED TO ALWAYS SAY,

604
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,300
"WE'RE ALL HERE TO LEARN
SOMETHING."

605
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,133
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID TO HIM?

606
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:10,733
"I DON'T WANT TO LEARN.
I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN."

607
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:14,400
I NEVER EVEN LIKED SCHOOL.
I ONLY LIKED RECESS.

608
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:16,733
OF COURSE,
HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

609
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:22,367
AND OF COURSE, THAT DIDN'T STOP
HIM FROM FUCKING ME, EITHER.

610
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,267
I THINK MOST MEN
ARE THE SAME.

611
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:32,200
JUST LITTLE BOYS PLAYING
GROWN-UP.

612
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:38,233
- * I CAN STILL REMEMBER
SWEET MEMORIES *

613
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:45,500
* THE WAY WE BELIEVED *

614
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,567
- I THINK I'M GONNA GO
FOR A SWIM.

615
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,667
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

616
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,167
- MAYBE.

617
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,733
I'M GONNA CHECK ON JULIE.

618
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,700
- OKAY.

619
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
- JULIE?

620
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,067
(SHOWER RUNNING)

621
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,067
HEY.

622
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,300
- OH. HEY.

623
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,333
- WHERE'S MARC?

624
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,700
- HE WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH
TO TAKE A WALK.

625
00:32:57,733 --> 00:33:00,633
- OH.

626
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,333
- WHAT?

627
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,267
- NOTHING.

628
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,733
YOU WANT TO TAKE
THE BOAT OUT TOMORROW?

629
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,700
- SURE.

630
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,767
- HEY, DID, UH, DID MARC GIVE
YOU ANY IDEA

631
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,267
WHEN HE WAS PLANNING
ON LEAVING?

632
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,633
- NO.

633
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,467
NOT HAPPY HE'S HERE?
THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.

634
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,167
- I AM.
IT'S NICE TO SEE HIM.

635
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,600
I JUST, UH...
I LIKE MY ALONE TIME.

636
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,767
- I THINK HE WAS UPSET
ABOUT CATHERINE.

637
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,167
- MARC? PLEASE.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

638
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,567
- I THINK HE WAS.

639
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,267
SHE WENT INTO TOWN
TO SEE AN OLD BOYFRIEND.

640
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,300
YOU DON'T THINK THAT
WOULD UPSET HIM?

641
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,133
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
FOR HOW LONG

642
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,100
AND YOU CAN'T TELL
HE'S COVERING UP YET?

643
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:54,133
- COVERING UP?

644
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,733
I PICKED HER UP
ON THE WAY BACK.

645
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,300
SHE WAS JUST WALKING ALONG.

646
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,533
- HUH? WHAT?

647
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:01,767
- NOTHING.

648
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:07,567
I SAID I PICKED HER UP
ON THE WAY BACK.

649
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,167
- OH.

650
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,767
- I'M GONNA GO OUT
TO THE POOL.

651
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,267
- OKAY.

652
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,700
- HAVE YOU SEEN MARC?

653
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:37,300
- UH, JULIE SAID HE WENT FOR
A WALK ON THE BEACH.

654
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,767
- OH. THANKS.

655
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,067
- SURE.

656
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,267
HMM.

657
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,267
UH, HOW'S THE WATER?

658
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,267
- REFRESHING.

659
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,100
ARE YOU GOING IN?

660
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,500
- UH, MAYBE.

661
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,600
SO, UH, WHAT BRINGS YOU TWO
OUT THIS WAY?

662
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:17,500
- UM, NOTHING, REALLY.

663
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,467
RELAXATION.

664
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,200
LITTLE GETAWAY.

665
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:25,033
MARC SAID HE'S HAD SOME PRETTY
MEMORABLE SUMMERS OUT HERE.

666
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:28,467
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

667
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,067
WHAT ABOUT YOU? IS THIS
THE NORMAL SUMMER THING?

668
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,133
- UM, YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.

669
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,333
I MEAN, I POP BACK INTO
THE CITY SOMETIMES,

670
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,133
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
WE STAY OUT HERE.

671
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,133
- MUST BE NICE.

672
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,800
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN MARRIED?

673
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,800
- UH, FIVE...
ALMOST SIX YEARS.

674
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,500
- OH, WOW.

675
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:58,333
THAT'S A PRETTY LONG TIME.

676
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,133
- YEAH, I GUESS.

677
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,400
IT'S ALL RELATIVE.

678
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:03,433
- (LAUGHING)
YEP.

679
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,467
AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

680
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,633
SO, ARE YOU STILL WRITING?

681
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,433
MARC SAID YOU WERE
A GREAT WRITER.

682
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:15,067
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

683
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,567
HE DOESN'T SAY THAT
TOO OFTEN.

684
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,633
UH, THAT SOMEONE'S GREAT...

685
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,267
AT ANYTHING.

686
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,733
- WELL, THAT WAS
NICE OF HIM.

687
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,200
- HE'S A NICE GUY.

688
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:28,000
- YEAH, HE IS.

689
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:34,667
- UH, I WAS JUST GONNA
POP INTO TOWN

690
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,133
AND GRAB SOME GROCERIES
FOR DINNER.

691
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,800
- DID YOU WANT SOME COMPANY?

692
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,567
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.
ENJOY THE POOL.

693
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,767
- I'LL COME WITH YOU.

694
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,567
- NO, IT'S FINE.
I'M OKAY.

695
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,700
- I DON'T MIND.
- NO, I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

696
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:48,033
KEYS IN THE CAR?

697
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:50,533
- YEAH.

698
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:53,633
- YOU NEED ANYTHING IN
PARTICULAR FROM THE STORE?

699
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,367
I WAS THINKING STEAKS
FOR DINNER.

700
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,800
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

701
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,800
- SOUNDS GREAT.

702
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,733
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT SOME COMPANY?

703
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:03,100
- I'M SURE.

704
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,733
MARC SHOULD BE GETTING
BACK PRETTY SOON.

705
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:07,133
I'LL BET HE'LL WANT TO
SEE YOU WHEN HE GETS BACK.

706
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,633
WOULDN'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT YOU EARLIER.

707
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,500
I THINK YOU'VE PUT
A SPELL ON HIM.

708
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:15,367
- YEAH, RIGHT. I DON'T HAVE
A SPELL STRONG ENOUGH.

709
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,300
- I'LL BE BACK.
- OKAY.

710
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,233
UH...

711
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:43,333
(WATER SPLASHING)

712
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,067
- UH-OH.

713
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,033
SOMEONE FEELING ADVENTUROUS?

714
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,500
(LAUGHING)

715
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:53,333
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WENT IN?

716
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,433
- UH...

717
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,067
LAST SUMMER, I GUESS.

718
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:02,267
- LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

719
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,400
- (CHUCKLES)

720
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,700
OKAY.

721
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,533
- (LAUGHING)
- WHOO.

722
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:33,367
- VERY NICE.

723
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,100
YOU'RE SMOOTH,

724
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,167
LIKE A PROFESSIONAL.

725
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,633
- THANK YOU.

726
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,800
- SEEMS A SHAME NOT
TO BE USED MORE.

727
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,633
- YEAH, I GUESS.

728
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:11,167
SO, HOW LONG HAVE THE TWO
OF YOU KNOWN EACH OTHER?

729
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,667
- WE MET ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

730
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,767
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SAID.

731
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:23,033
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

732
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:25,700
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SELL ME ON HIM.

733
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:29,200
I HAVEN'T MET TOO MANY PEOPLE
WHO GET ME AS WELL AS HE DOES.

734
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,600
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING.

735
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,133
- NO?

736
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,667
- MAYBE IT IS.

737
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,567
MAYBE IT ISN'T.

738
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,100
HAVEN'T MET TOO MANY PEOPLE
WHO DO.

739
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:42,567
EVERYONE'S SO HUNG UP ON ALL
THEIR LITTLE LABELS AND...

740
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,233
CATEGORIES.

741
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,300
I GUESS IT'S SAFER.

742
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,367
FEELS SAFER.

743
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,167
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DIDN'T LIKE SCHOOL.

744
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,433
- YOU WERE LISTENING.

745
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:00,633
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

746
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,800
I TAKE IT YOU LIKE THE LABELS
THING.

747
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,133
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

748
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:07,567
- I DON'T KNOW.

749
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,400
HUSBAND, WIFE.
THAT'S PRETTY BIG LABELS.

750
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,100
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THAT WITH ME AND JULIE.

751
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:14,133
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

752
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,667
- I JUST-- I DON'T KNOW.

753
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,233
I GUESS WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,

754
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:22,267
IT WASN'T ABOUT THOSE LABELS,
YOU KNOW?

755
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,200
- AND NOW?

756
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,167
- I SEE WHY MARC LIKES YOU.

757
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
IT HELPS SOMETIMES,
THE LABELS.

758
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:41,300
- YEAH?
- YEAH, SOMETIMES.

759
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,333
HELPS PEOPLE TO
KNOW WHAT'S WHAT.

760
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,033
- AND WHO'S WHO.

761
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,267
AND WHERE'S WHERE.

762
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,400
AND WHY'S WHY.

763
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:52,767
- (CHUCKLES)

764
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,633
- MARC SAID YOU WERE
A THINKER.

765
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,533
- YEAH?

766
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,767
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

767
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,667
- HE ALSO SAID YOU HAD
PRETTY EYES.

768
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:16,667
HE WASN'T LYING.

769
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,333
HE ALSO SAID YOU WERE
A PRETTY GOOD ACTOR, TOO.

770
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,033
I BELIEVE HIM.

771
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,700
SO, ARE YOU STILL WRITING?

772
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:48,300
- UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

773
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,600
I GUESS I GOT SOME STORIES
ROLLING AROUND IN MY HEAD,

774
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,800
BUT, UH, I THINK
MOST WRITERS

775
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,700
ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON
UP THERE.

776
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:57,033
- WHY AREN'T YOU
WRITING THEM?

777
00:41:57,067 --> 00:42:00,133
- UH, PEOPLE WEREN'T TOO
INTERESTED

778
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,533
IN WHAT I WAS WRITING.

779
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,733
IT GETS PRETTY TIRING BARING
YOUR SOUL

780
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:08,167
AND PEOPLE JUST AREN'T
GETTING IT.

781
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,133
BESIDES, I DON'T THINK
I NEEDED TO SO MUCH.

782
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:14,767
I WAS YOUNG, HAD A LOT OF
CONFUSION,

783
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,333
THINGS TO WORK OUT.

784
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:21,267
IT'S, UH, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WRITING IS GOOD FOR.

785
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,233
- SO NOW YOU GOT IT
ALL FIGURED OUT?

786
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:25,533
- MAYBE.

787
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,167
- WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
FILL ME IN

788
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,300
ON SOME OF THE MYSTERIES
OF LIFE, THEN.

789
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,700
- SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU
ALREADY GOT SOME THINGS
FIGURED OUT AS WELL.

790
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:34,567
- MAYBE, BUT NOT EVERYTHING.

791
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,033
- IT GETS BORING
ONCE YOU DO.

792
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,033
- OH.
(LAUGHING)

793
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:40,233
IS THAT THE BIG SECRET?

794
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,633
- (LAUGHING)

795
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,733
- I HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER.

796
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:47,300
TELL MARC IF YOU SEE HIM.

797
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,633
- SURE.

- YOU'RE VERY FOCUSED.

809
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,233
- I GUESS THAT WAS
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS
I GOT FROM MY FATHER.

810
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,367
- COME ON.

811
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:46,700
- OH, NO, THANKS.
- YOU SURE?

812
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:49,333
- YEAH, I'M SURE.
- OKAY.

813
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,200
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY
NICE PLACE.

814
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:56,433
- THANKS.

815
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:59,467
IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY
FOR A WHILE.

816
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,133
MY FATHER BUILT IT.

817
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:03,067
- REALLY?

818
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,767
- WELL, HE DIDN'T DO
THE ACTUAL BUILDING,

819
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,367
BUT HE WAS INVOLVED IN
THE DESIGN AND ALL.

820
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,567
- OH, WOW.

821
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,633
IT'S NICE.

822
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,733
IT'S KIND OF...

823
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:17,133
CLASSIC.

824
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,333
- YEAH.

825
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,333
- UM, I'M SORRY.

826
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:29,333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I JUST...

827
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,767
I JUST KEEP WANTING
TO LOOK AT YOU.

828
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,200
- OKAY.

829
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:36,467
- I KNOW IT'S NOT POLITE,
RIGHT?

830
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,767
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

831
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,500
I GUESS I'VE HEARD
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

832
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:41,567
- YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.

833
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,200
- THANK YOU.

834
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,467
COULD I ACTUALLY--
I CHANGED MY MIND.

835
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,733
- YEAH.

836
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:11,067
- THANK YOU.

837
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:22,233

00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:25,033
- HUH?

839
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:26,800
- THE WINE.

840
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:29,100
DID YOU PICK IT OUT?

841
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:32,367
- OH, NO. DAVID, HE'S A...

842
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,467
I TEASE HIM ABOUT BEING
A WINE SNOB.

843
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,167
IT'S GOOD,
HE KNOWS WHAT I LIKE.

844
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,400
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

845
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:44,033
- YEAH, IT IS.

846
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,033
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON, DON'T YOU?

847
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

848
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:52,633
- I MEAN WITH ME AND MARC,
YOU AND DAVID.

849
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,567
WE'RE FORMING MEMORIES.

850
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:03,667
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY AMAZING,
RIGHT?

851
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,133
ONE DAY, WE'LL LOOK BACK
ON THIS AND...

852
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:12,067
REMEMBER IT EXACTLY HOW WE
WANT TO REMEMBER IT.

853
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,267
YEAH.

854
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,667
IT'S WHAT I SAID.

855
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,667
EXACTLY HOW YOU WANT
TO REMEMBER IT.

856
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:26,400
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

857
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,233
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THIS
WEEKEND,

858
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:30,767
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO REMEMBER?

859
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,800
- GOOD WINE.

860
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,233
GOOD COMPANY.

861
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:39,467
SOME LAUGHS.

862
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,600
- (LAUGHING)

863
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:43,600
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD LIFE.

864
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:45,467
- I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

865
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,567
- YEAH, YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE
THE TYPE.

866
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,800
- NAH. I USED TO.

867
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,267
DECIDED IT DIDN'T HELP ME
WITH ANYTHING.

868
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,300
- YEAH.

00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:25,200
* DOWN TO THIS LIFE ON
A DEAD-END STREET *

875
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:26,800
- (MUMBLING)

876
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,367
- * YOU CAN BUY HER
SOME DRINKS *

877
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,367
* BUT DON'T LOOK NOW,
YOUR BABY'S CHANGING SEATS *

878
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,667
- (TALKING, INDISTINCT)

879
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:43,767
- * YOU DO YOUR BEST AND GO
BOOM BOOM BOOM *

880
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,067
* BUT THIS WORLD KEEPS
TURNING... **

881
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,333
- BEAUTIFUL DAY.

882
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:50,333
- YEAH.

883
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:52,600
- THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING ALONG
QUITE WELL, DON'T THEY?

884
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,567
- YEP.

885
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,800
- SO WHO HAS THE
RIGHT-OF-WAY?

886
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:03,600
- OH, WE DO
WITH MOTORBOATS.

887
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:07,133
WITH OTHER SAILBOATS, IT'S
WHOEVER HAS THE STARBOARD TACK.

888
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,333
- AH.

889
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:13,667
CATHERINE TELLS ME YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN WRITING MUCH.

890
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,400
- YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD
VERY MUCH TO WRITE ABOUT.

891
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,100
LIFE HAS GOTTEN
PRETTY SIMPLE.

892
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,567
I MEAN, GOOD SIMPLE.

893
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,667
- OH, SURE.

894
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,500
- I'M HAPPY.
JULIE'S HAPPY.

895
00:49:24,533 --> 00:49:27,267
I DON'T KNOW. WE JUST DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,

896
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,733
WHICH IS GOOD.

897
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:31,100
IT'S NICE TO FEEL
THE SECURITY.

898
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:33,133
- SECURITY.

899
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:35,033
- YEAH. SECURITY.

900
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,467
- WELL, JULIE DOES
SEEM HAPPY.

901
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
- YEAH, SHE IS.

902
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:43,767
- OH. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

903
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,167
- OH, REALLY?
(LAUGHING)

904
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,433
- CAREFUL.

905
00:49:53,467 --> 00:49:55,167
- HOW ABOUT FRED'S FOR LUNCH?

906
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,233
- SURE.

907
00:49:58,433 --> 00:49:59,800
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU SMOKED.

908
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:03,033
- I DON'T...
I MEAN, NOT REALLY.

909
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:06,300
I USED TO, LIKE A FIEND,
BACK IN COLLEGE.

910
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,500
AND A FEW YEARS AFTER.

911
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:10,267
IT'S VERY ADDICTIVE.

912
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,400
- ORAL FIXATION.

913
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:13,600
- IT'S NOT.

914
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:17,533
THIS IS MY SECOND,
THIRD IN YEARS.

915
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:18,800
I NEVER TOLD YOU?

916
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,800
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

917
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,400
- WELL, WE GOT TO HAVE SOME
SECRETS, DON'T WE?

918
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,433
- I WAS--

919
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:27,167
I DON'T THINK IT EVER CAME UP.

920
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,667
FUNNY. IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

921
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,733
- I GUESS CATHERINE'S A BAD
INFLUENCE ON YOU, EH?

922
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,633
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO YOU
SMOKING CIGARS?

923
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:35,633
THAT WAS A REGULAR THING
WITH YOU, WASN'T IT?

924
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,400
- YEAH, IT WAS.

925
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:39,400
BUT I WAS ENCOURAGED TO QUIT.

926
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:41,567
BUT I CAN SEE THE RULES ARE
CHANGING NOW.

927
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,800
- I NEVER TOLD YOU TO QUIT.
- SUBTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS.

928
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,367
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

929
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,767
- YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT, RIGHT?

930
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,267
- YEAH, BUT--
- SO I QUIT.

931
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,767
I DON'T HAVE AN ADDICTIVE
PERSONALITY.

932
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,100
- THAT IS TRUE. YOU NEVER DID
GET HUNG UP ON MUCH.

933
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,567
SELF-DISCIPLINE?

934
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,600
- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK IT'S
MORE ABOUT HARD-WIRING.

935
00:50:57,633 --> 00:51:00,133
- I FIGURED IT WAS ALL THAT
BUDDHIST STUFF YOU READ.

936
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,733
- YOU'RE A BUDDHIST?
- NO, I JUST READ SOME STUFF.

937
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:05,167
- AH. SEEKING ANSWERS.

938
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,633
- I GUESS.

939
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,167
- FIND ANY?

940
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,567
- JUST MORE QUESTIONS.

941
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,033
- YOU ARE A DEEP MAN.

942
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,200
- FUNNY.
- AM I?

943
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,133
- I NEVER TOLD YOU
TO QUIT.

944
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,367
- I GUESS IT WAS
MISCOMMUNICATION.

945
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,600
- I GUESS SO.
WHAT ELSE?

946
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:25,500
- WHAT ELSE WHAT?

947
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,567
- ARE THERE OTHER THINGS YOU
FEEL I'VE ASKED YOU TO CHANGE?

948
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,267
- I WAS JUST PLAYING.

949
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,167
IF I DIDN'T WANT TO QUIT,
I WOULDN'T HAVE QUIT.

950
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,133
- I NEVER WANTED YOU
TO CHANGE.

951
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:37,200
I HOPE I HAVEN'T SAID THINGS

952
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:38,800
THAT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE HAD TO.

953
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,367
- YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED?

954
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,300
I MEAN BESIDES BECOMING
OLD AND UNAGGRESSIVE.

955
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,433
- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
THE WAY IT SOUNDED.

956
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:48,367
- YEAH, IT SOUNDED
PRETTY SINCERE.

957
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,800
- DAVID.

958
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,733
THIS IS FUN.

959
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:55,300
AREN'T YOU HAVING
A GOOD TIME?

960
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,667
- YEAH, I AM.

961
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,400
- WHAT'S WRONG?

962
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:01,200
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE THINKING.

963
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:03,200
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THINKING
WASN'T GOOD FOR YOU.

964
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:05,167
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
SOMETIMES IT IS.

965
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,033
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT?

966
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:10,567
COME ON, WHAT IS IT?

967
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,167
- HAS HE SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU?

968
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,033
- MARC?
ABOUT WHAT?

969
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:18,167
- I DON'T KNOW, ANYTHING.

970
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,667
- (SIGHS)

971
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,200
WOULD YOU JUST RELAX
AND HAVE FUN?

972
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:28,400
SHE'S SWEET.

973
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:31,467
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE IN LOVE.

974
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,733
MAYBE HE JUST WANTED TO
SHOW OFF HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND,

975
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:38,300
MAKE YOU JEALOUS.

976
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:41,033
- MAKE ME JEALOUS? PLEASE.

977
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:43,133
- WHAT?

978
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:46,133
- I THINK HE STILL HAS
A CRUSH ON YOU.

979
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:48,267
- ME?

980
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,567
- YEAH. WHY DO YOU THINK
HE TOOK OFF FOR L.A.?

981
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,800
I KNOW IT BOTHERED HIM WHEN
WE STARTED DATING.

982
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:58,033
- UM, YOU REALLY THINK IT WAS
ME HE HAD A CRUSH ON?

983
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:00,467
- YEAH. WHY?

984
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,567
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

985
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,300
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

986
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,033
- I...

987
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:10,267
I JUST DON'T THINK HE HAD
A CRUSH ON ME, THAT'S ALL.

988
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,400
YOU TWO WERE BEST FRIENDS,

989
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,600
AND I COME ALONG
AND STEAL YOU AWAY.

990
00:53:14,633 --> 00:53:17,267
- YOU DIDN'T STEAL ME AWAY.

991
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,700
- YEAH. YEAH, I DID.

992
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:26,367
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

993
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,433
- LET'S STOP SOMEWHERE
ON THE WAY BACK

994
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:31,400
AND GETS SOME NICE CIGARS.

995
00:53:31,433 --> 00:53:34,367
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

996
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,600
- I AM.

997
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:39,567
- GOOD.

998
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:45,000
(PLANE FLYING OVERHEAD)

999
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:54,100
- IT'S SO PEACEFUL
OUT HERE.

1000
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:56,300
I CAN SEE WHY YOU GUYS
LIKE IT SO MUCH.

1001
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,733
IF I LIVED OUT HERE,
I WOULD NEVER LEAVE.

1002
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:03,033
- (LAUGHING)

1003
00:54:03,067 --> 00:54:05,167
- DID YOU COME OUT HERE
WHEN YOU WERE A KID, TOO?

1004
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,800
- YEAH.

1005
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:10,267
IT WASN'T SO PEACEFUL THEN.

1006
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,600
MY FATHER WAS A...

1007
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:18,167
WELL, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD,
A RAGE-A-HOLIC.

1008
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,500
WE WERE ALWAYS WALKING ON
EGGSHELLS.

1009
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:23,600
I DON'T KNOW HOW MY MOTHER PUT
UP WITH HIM AS LONG AS SHE DID.

1010
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:25,667
- WHAT WAS HE RAGING ABOUT?

1011
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,567
- I DON'T KNOW.

1012
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,767
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HIM.

1013
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,633
NEVER REALLY GOT TO KNOW HIM.

1014
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:34,733
I'LL HAVE TO TRY
WHAT YOU SAID.

1015
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:36,700
REMEMBER THINGS THE WAY
I WANT TO REMEMBER THEM.

1016
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:39,733
- (LAUGHING)
MIGHT AS WELL, RIGHT?

1017
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:41,700
- YEAH, SELF-DECEPTION.
THAT WORKS.

1018
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:44,200
- THINK SO?
- DON'T YOU?

1019
00:54:44,233 --> 00:54:45,333
- HE DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

1020
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:47,067
- BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

1021
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,100
WE REMEMBER THINGS THE WAY
WE WANT TO REMEMBER THEM.

1022
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:51,633
MIGHT AS WELL FOCUS ON THE
POSITIVE THINGS, RIGHT?

1023
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:54,367
WHY GET ALL BOGGED DOWN WITH
THE NEGATIVE STUFF?

1024
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,700
- WELL, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
OTHER STUFF DIDN'T HAPPEN.

1025
00:54:57,733 --> 00:55:01,133
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

1026
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:03,533
- BUT MAYBE OUR PERCEPTION
ISN'T ALWAYS ACCURATE.

1027
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,067
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

1028
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,300
- LIKE, THE OTHER DAY,
WHEN I WAS IN--

1029
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:11,233
WHEN I WAS IN TOWN
SEEING MICHAEL,

1030
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:15,167
HE WAS SAYING THINGS THAT I
THOUGHT WERE OUT OF FOCUS.

1031
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,633
- HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
REMEMBER WAS IN FOCUS?

1032
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:20,067
- I DON'T.
(LAUGHING)

1033
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:24,700
I MEAN, I GUESS I QUESTION IT
EVERY SO OFTEN, YOU KNOW?

1034
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:28,067
JUST SLOW DOWN AND FEEL IT.

1035
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,133
OR QUESTION IT.

1036
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,100
BUT I DON'T THINK MICHAEL
EVER DID.

1037
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:35,700
HE WAS ALWAYS SO SET ON WHAT
WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS WRONG,

1038
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:39,233
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
THE PROBLEM WAS.

1039
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:40,600
I DON'T CARE WHAT'S
RIGHT OR WRONG.

1040
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:42,467
I CAN GIVE A FUCK.

1041
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,300
BUT HE JUST COULDN'T
LET IT GO.

1042
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:50,567
HE JUST ALWAYS WANTED TO DEBATE
SOMETHING THAT I WAS DOING.

1043
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,300
(CHUCKLING)
WHO CAN LIVE LIKE THAT?

1044
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,167
- WELL, I GUESS HE CAN.

1045
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,333
- YEAH.

1046
00:55:57,367 --> 00:55:58,800
- YOU WANT TO GO
FOR A WALK ON THE BEACH?

1047
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,433
- SURE.

1048
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,500
- YOU GUYS WANT TO GO FOR
A WALK ON THE BEACH?

1049
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:03,700
- I'LL PASS.

1050
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:06,167
- JULES?
- TOO TIRED.

1051
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,767
- COME ON.

1052
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,367
BOO.

1053
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,400
HERE.

1054
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,767
- NO, NO, NO, LEAVE IT.

1055
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,800
- YOU SURE?
- SEE YOU GUYS IN THE MORNING.

1056
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:17,033
- OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DELICIOUS.

1057
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:29,433
- HE SEEMS REALLY HAPPY.

1058
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:31,733
- YEAH.

1059
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:47,533
- SO WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO TAKE
THE BOAT OUT TODAY?

1060
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:50,233
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

1061
00:56:50,267 --> 00:56:51,767
- YEAH.

1062
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,200
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I JUST FELT LIKE IT.

1063
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,600
- YOU FELT LIKE IT?

1064
00:56:58,633 --> 00:57:02,533
- YEAH. I FELT LIKE IT.

1065
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:05,433
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1066
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:06,667
- WHAT, THE WINE?

1067
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,600
I'M WRITING.

1068
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:13,567
- YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED THAT
THING IN...

1069
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,400
I DON'T KNOW.

1070
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:18,667
- YEAH. WELL, I GUESS I'VE BEEN
BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS.

1071
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,233
- OTHER THINGS?
- YEAH.

1072
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:23,533
THE RESTAURANT FOR ONE.

1073
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,400
- DID, UM...

1074
00:57:25,433 --> 00:57:27,800
DID MARC ASK YOU
TO WRITE SOMETHING?

1075
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,500
- NO.

1076
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,733
HE ASKED IF I HAD BEEN WRITING,
WHICH MADE ME THINK.

1077
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:36,767
THEN I REALIZED I HAVEN'T
WRITTEN ANYTHING IN
QUITE A WHILE.

1078
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,233
- I GUESS MARC BEING HERE HAS
SOME GOOD POINTS TOO, HUH?

1079
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:53,133
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
WRITING ABOUT?

1080
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,333
IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

1081
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:03,567
YOU GONNA WORK OUT SOME ANGST?

1082
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,700
- MAYBE.
- MAYBE?

1083
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:09,367
- YEAH. MAYBE THAT'S WHY
I'M WRITING.

1084
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:14,567
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1085
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,567
- NOTHING.

1086
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,333
- REALLY?

1087
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,800
WELL, IT SURE DOES SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING.

1088
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,367
- BUT I'M NOT.
REMEMBER?

1089
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,533
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS AS THEY
APPEAR TO BE.

1090
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,633
- OH. WHO SAID THAT?

1091
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,600
- ME. JUST NOW.

1092
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,033
SO WHY ARE YOU WRITING?

1093
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:40,467
- OOH. HA HA.

1094
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,033
TO LEARN.

1095
00:58:42,067 --> 00:58:44,167
- TO LEARN?

1096
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,600
- YEAH.

1097
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:48,800
I GUESS THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON-- OH--

1098
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,400
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

1099
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:52,033
- SOMETHING'S GOING ON?

1100
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:54,533
- OH, YEAH. YES, DEFINITELY.

1101
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:57,167
- YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT?

1102
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,567
- UH-HUH.

1103
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,300
(EXHALES)

1104
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,433
- THAT'S GOOD.
- YEAH, IT IS.

1105
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:07,600
- WHAT IS, UM,
MARC'S PHILOSOPHY?

1106
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:09,133
- WHAT?

1107
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:10,733
- THE OTHER DAY WHEN
YOU WERE PLAYING TENNIS,

1108
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:12,300
ABOUT KEEPING SCORE.

1109
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,300
- (MOANING)

1110
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,633
UH, UH...

1111
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,500
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
TELL ME.

1112
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:20,067
- I CAN'T.
I CAN'T THINK RIGHT NOW.

1113
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,567
- WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU WANT ME TO STOP?

1114
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,100
- NO, NO, PLEASE DON'T.
PLEASE DON'T.

1115
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:25,333
OHH.

1116
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,233
- COME ON, WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO SAY?

1117
00:59:27,267 --> 00:59:29,467
- OH. OH, GOD, I CAN'T.

1118
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,467
OHH. I DON'T WANT TO
THINK ABOUT MARC RIGHT NOW.

1119
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,733
- WHY NOT?

1120
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:35,600
- (MOANING)

1121
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:37,633
OH, YEAH, YEAH. OH.

1122
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:39,367
OH, GOD.

1123
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,100
OHH!

1124
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:42,667
OH, GOD.

1125
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,500
OH. OH.

1126
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:49,267
(MOANING)

1127
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:54,100
WHEW.

1128
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,533
(LAUGHING)

1129
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:13,733
OH. OH. OH.

1130
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:15,633
HE, UH...

1131
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:19,233
HE THINKS THAT, UH...

1132
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:22,700
THE NEED TO KEEP SCORE IS
FOR PEOPLE WHO, UM,

1133
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:26,067
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
WE'RE ALL ONE.

1134
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,033
COMPLETELY CONNECTED.

1135
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:32,200
THERE IS NO YOU OR ME.

1136
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:38,067
THAT THE NEED TO DOMINATE AND
WIN IS, UH, AN EGO THING.

1137
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,700
AND IF YOU TRANSCEND THE EGO,

1138
01:00:40,733 --> 01:00:46,333
YOU WILL SEE THERE IS
NO WINNING OR LOSING.

1139
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:50,533
THERE IS JUST WHAT THERE IS.

1140
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:53,733
- I DIDN'T KNOW MARC
WAS SO DEEP.

1141
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:56,267
- HMM.

1142
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,533
- AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1143
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:08,733
- I DON'T KNOW.

1144
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:12,433
I KIND OF LIKE THE GAME OF
DOMINANCE AND SUBMISSION.

1145
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,500
(SPLASHING)

1146
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:26,133
- OH!
HA HA!

1147
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:28,333
(LAUGHING)

1148
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:30,433
(SPLASHING)

1149
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:35,667
OH!

1150
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:41,400
(COUGHING)

1151
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:43,467
(LAUGHING)

1152
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,200
OH!

1153
01:01:50,733 --> 01:01:52,467
- GOOD MORROW!

1154
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,467
- GOOD MORROW.

1155
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,267
- (LAUGHING)

1156
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,200
YOU UP FOR A LITTLE RUN
WITH ME TODAY?

1157
01:01:57,233 --> 01:01:58,700
- MM-MMM.

1158
01:01:58,733 --> 01:02:00,367
- YOU DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
GETTING RID OF THAT,

1159
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,633
DID YOU NOT?

1160
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:02,700
- OH, FUNNY.

1161
01:02:02,733 --> 01:02:03,767
- SMELLS GOOD.

1162
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,200
GOOD MORNING.

1163
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,400
- ARE WE BEING RUDE?
I'M SORRY.

1164
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:14,167
- NO. GO.

1165
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,467
I WAS JUST TRYING TO CONVINCE
DAVID TO GO FOR A LITTLE RUN.

1166
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,233
- OH. I'VE TRIED, TOO, BUT--

1167
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,667
- WHAT?
WAIT, GET OUT OF HERE.

1168
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,433
- CATHERINE STILL SLEEPING?

1169
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:25,167
- NO, NO, SHE'S AN
EARLY RISER.

1170
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,400
SHE IS DOING YOGA
ON YOUR BACK LAWN.

1171
01:02:27,433 --> 01:02:28,600
- REALLY?

1172
01:02:28,633 --> 01:02:31,400
- YEAH. PRETTY MUCH EVERY
MORNING.

1173
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:33,100
- WOW.

1174
01:02:33,133 --> 01:02:34,633
- OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

1175
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,067
- YEAH?
- WOW.

1176
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,233
- WHAT?

1177
01:02:38,267 --> 01:02:40,100
I'LL GO THROW SOME
SNEAKERS ON.

1178
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:41,367
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT EASY
ON ME, THOUGH, RIGHT?

1179
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,567
- YEAH.

1180
01:02:45,267 --> 01:02:47,567
- GOOD JOB.

1181
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,767
- LOOKS LIKE I GOT
A RUNNING PARTNER.

1182
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,700
- VERY GOOD.

1183
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:14,600
MORNING.

1184
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:16,800
- AM I INTERRUPTING?

1185
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:20,533
- OH, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

1186
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:23,133
- PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

1187
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:26,600
- SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME
WHEN I FIRST STARTED.

1188
01:03:26,633 --> 01:03:29,367
IT'S JUST PRACTICE,
YOU KNOW?

1189
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:35,233
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.

1190
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:37,333
MY MOTHER USED TO
ALWAYS SAY THAT.

1191
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:39,300
JUST LIKE THAT, TOO.

1192
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:42,400
(LAUGHING)
I GUESS IT WORKED.

1193
01:03:42,433 --> 01:03:44,533
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

1194
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,433
- YOU EVER TRY? YOGA?

1195
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:51,733
- OH, NO.

1196
01:03:51,767 --> 01:03:54,267
WELL, ACTUALLY, ONCE.

1197
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,067
WE WERE IN THE BAHAMAS AT THIS
RESORT-TYPE PLACE,

1198
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,500
AND IT WAS MAINLY COUPLES.

1199
01:04:00,533 --> 01:04:03,067
THEY HAD THIS
BEGINNERS' CLASS.

1200
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,233
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
ON THE BEACH.

1201
01:04:05,267 --> 01:04:09,200
SOUNDED SO NICE, I THOUGHT,
WHY NOT, YOU KNOW?

1202
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:12,100
WAS GONNA CHANGE MY LIFE.

1203
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:16,400
I THOUGHT, I'M GONNA BE
A YOGA PERSON.

1204
01:04:16,433 --> 01:04:19,300
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,
I WILL DO YOGA.

1205
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,200
(CHUCKLES)

1206
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:24,700
I WAS GONNA BE HEALTHY.

1207
01:04:24,733 --> 01:04:27,033
I WAS EVEN PICTURING ALL
THE BLENDED JUICE DRINKS

1208
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:29,667
I WOULD HAVE EVERY DAY,
YOU KNOW,

1209
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,500
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.

1210
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:34,167
BUT I TRIED. I MEAN,
I KIND OF TRIED.

1211
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,667
SOMETHING DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

1212
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:40,467
I PRETENDED SOMETHING WAS
WRONG WITH MY STOMACH,

1213
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,567
AND I EXCUSED MYSELF.

1214
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:47,167
THINK I LASTED, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES.

1215
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,067
THE INSTRUCTOR IN THOSE PLACES,
THEY DON'T REALLY CARE.

1216
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,633
I'M SURE SHE THOUGHT,
"OH, GOOD,

1217
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:54,667
ANOTHER BEGINNER I DON'T HAVE
TO HELP," YOU KNOW?

1218
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,467
- COME HERE.

1219
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,433
YOU WANNA TRY?
I'LL HELP YOU.

1220
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,167
- UH, THAT'S OKAY.

1221
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,500
- BETTER DO IT NOW.
IT NOT GONNA GET ANY EASIER.

1222
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:03,067
- THAT'S WHAT I'M
AFRAID OF.

1223
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,767
- COME ON.

1224
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:10,233
- OKAY.

1225
01:05:10,267 --> 01:05:12,500
- FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

1226
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,733
- IF I COULD CATCH MY BREATH,
YEAH.

1227
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:17,167
- OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

1228
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,767
- OH.

1229
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,633
NO, REALLY.
I GOT TO

1230
01:05:22,667 --> 01:05:24,600
OH, I GOT TO
CATCH MY BREATH.

1231
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:27,067
OH. OH.

1232
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,533
OH, JESUS.

1233
01:05:28,567 --> 01:05:31,500
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN.
CATCH YOUR BREATH.

1234
01:05:31,533 --> 01:05:34,733
- OH, MAN.
UGH.

1235
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:36,300
THIS IS FUCKING PATHETIC.

1236
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:39,300
I JUST RAN A MARATHON
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

1237
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:41,167
- THAT WAS, LIKE, SIX OR SEVEN
YEARS AGO, WASN'T IT?

1238
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,400
- WHAT?
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

1239
01:05:46,267 --> 01:05:48,367
- YOU FEEL THAT?

1240
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,067
NOW TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

1241
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,067
- (INHALES)

1242
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,567
- AND EXHALE.

1243
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,267
- (EXHALES)

1244
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,533
WOW.

1245
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:06,067
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW GOOD THIS FEELS.

1246
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,233
- HOW YOU FEELING?

1247
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:15,300
- LIKE SHIT.

1248
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:17,100
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

1249
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:36,500
- WHY DO YOU RESIST THINGS?

1250
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:44,267
I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE HAS TO BE
ALL THIS TENSION BETWEEN US.

1251
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,767
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN THINGS
WERE RELAXED?

1252
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,633
I DON'T BLAME YOU, YOU KNOW.

1253
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:54,267
JULIE'S A GREAT CATCH.

1254
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,033
IF SHE'D HAVE PICKED ME,
I WOULD HAVE DONE--

1255
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:57,567
- PICKED YOU?

1256
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,567
- YEAH.

1257
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,133
WHY NOT?

1258
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:05,467
EVERYTHING COULD BE DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW.

1259
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,600
EVERYTHING COULD STILL BE
DIFFERENT.

1260
01:07:07,633 --> 01:07:11,033
THERE'S NOTHING ETCHED
IN STONE.

1261
01:07:11,067 --> 01:07:14,367
THE SIMPLEST OF THINGS CAN
CHANGE EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

1262
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,733
THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS.

1263
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:21,633
DID YOU FORGET THAT EVERYTHING
IS SO FRAGILE?

1264
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:24,100
I GUESS YOU DID FORGET.

1265
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:29,067
- THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

1266
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,533
- SO WHAT'S CHANGED?

1267
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:32,667
- WHAT'S CHANGED?
- YEAH, WHAT'S CHANGED?

1268
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,033
- I'M MARRIED.

1269
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:38,267
- JEEZ, LIKE THAT FUCKING
MEANS ANYTHING.

1270
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,367
- YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE.

1271
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,600
- THAT'S THE BEST YOU GOT,
HUH?

1272
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,767
I'M AN ASSHOLE?

1273
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,533
OKAY, YEAH, I'M AN ASSHOLE.

1274
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:57,433
SO WHAT?
WHO FUCKING CARES?

1275
01:07:57,467 --> 01:07:59,600
DID YOU HEAR THAT, OCEAN?

1276
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:03,400
I'M AN ASSHOLE!

1277
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:11,433
DAVID THINKS I'M AN ASSHOLE.

1278
01:08:21,367 --> 01:08:24,700
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
I HAD A SHOT WITH JULIE?

1279
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,367
- WOULD HAVE NEVER WORKED.

1280
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,600
SHE'S DIFFERENT.

1281
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:31,533
- FRAGILE?

1282
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:36,233
WHY DON'T YOU ASK JULIE
IF I EVER HAD A SHOT?

1283
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:25,333
(MOANING)

1284
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
(MOANING)

1285
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:36,000
(MOANING)

1286
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,300
(MOANING)

1287
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:57,767
(MOANING)

1288
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,033
- HEY.

1289
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:15,667
- HEY.

1290
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,700
- HAVE YOU SEEN, UH--
- SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

1291
01:10:18,733 --> 01:10:20,633
- WHERE'S MARC?

1292
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,800
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

1293
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:24,567
I'M FINE.

1294
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,133
HOW WAS YOUR RUN?

1295
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:28,267
- IT WAS GOOD.

1296
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,500
I MEAN, IT WAS OKAY.
I'M A BIT OUT OF SHAPE.

1297
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:32,600
MARC KEPT GOING.

1298
01:10:32,633 --> 01:10:34,667
- JULIE WANTS TO SHOW ME
SOMETHING.

1299
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,167
SHE JUST HOPPED IN THE SHOWER.

1300
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,600
- OH. OKAY.

1301
01:10:39,633 --> 01:10:41,733
DID YOU TWO EAT ANYTHING?

1302
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:45,200
- UH...NO.

1303
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:47,167
- OKAY.

1304
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,633
I'M GOING TO CHECK ON JULIE,

1305
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:50,800
AND THEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT
POPPING INTO TOWN

1306
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,800
AND GETTING SOME STUFF TO MAKE
US BRUNCH.

1307
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,700
- SOUNDS GREAT.

1308
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:58,267
IF I SEE MARC,
I'LL TELL HIM.

1309
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,367
MAYBE HE'LL WANT TO TAKE
A RIDE WITH YOU.

1310
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,467
- OKAY.

1311
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,467
- AAH!

1312
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,500
YOU SCARED ME.

1313
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:26,000
- SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

1314
01:11:28,633 --> 01:11:31,400
- MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

1315
01:11:31,433 --> 01:11:33,533
- NO. SURE.

1316
01:12:03,567 --> 01:12:08,267
- CATHERINE SAID YOU WANTED
TO SHOW HER SOMETHING?

1317
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,467
- UH, NO.
IT WAS NOTHING.

1318
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:23,800
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1319
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,233
- NOTHING.

1320
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:50,800
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE MAD.

1321
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,567
- WHAT FOR?

1322
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,333
- SOMETHING HAPPENED.

1323
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,733
- THAT WAS SO GOOD, JULIE.

1324
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:08,733
WHAT DID YOU PUT ON THAT?

1325
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:12,333
- NOTHING SPECIAL.

1326
01:13:12,367 --> 01:13:14,100
COULD I?

1327
01:13:14,133 --> 01:13:16,700
- OH. YEAH. SORRY.

1328
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:18,200
SO RUDE.

1329
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:20,767
- SALT, PEPPER.

1330
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,767
OH, SOME SPICY MUSTARD.

1331
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,600
- THAT'S-THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

1332
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:28,533
MUSTARD, SPICY,
DELICIOUS.

1333
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:30,033
- THANK YOU.

1334
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,067
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1335
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,800
- UH, I'M GONNA GRAB
A COUPLE CIGARS.

1336
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:40,367
- I'LL, UH...
I'LL HELP YOU.

1337
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,467
- SHOULD I OPEN
ANOTHER BOTTLE?

1338
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,200
- SURE.
- ANY PREFERENCE?

1339
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:46,433
- YOU ARE THE SOMMELIER.

1340
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,333
- WHAT'S THAT?

1341
01:13:49,367 --> 01:13:50,567
- WINE SNOB.

1342
01:14:09,267 --> 01:14:10,533
ARE YOU OKAY?

1343
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:13,033
- I'M FINE. WHY?

1344
01:14:13,067 --> 01:14:16,500
- YOU JUST SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING.

1345
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:19,633
- YEAH, WELL, I'M ALWAYS
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING.

1346
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:21,667
- NOTHING IN PARTICULAR?

1347
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,667
- I'M JUST TRYING TO DECIDE
WHICH WINE.

1348
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,633
- OH.

1349
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,667
- THIS SHOULD BE NICE.

1350
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,100
COULD YOU?

1351
01:14:35,633 --> 01:14:37,467
- OOH.

1352
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:43,467
- SO ARE YOU
ENJOYING YOURSELF?

1353
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,033
- (SIGHS)
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S NICE.

1354
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,733
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

1355
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:52,467
- YEAH.

1356
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:56,733
I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S THINKING TOO MUCH.

1357
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:59,300
- YEAH, MAYBE.

1358
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,167
(SIGHS)

1359
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,367
- (CATHERINE)
I'M SO GLAD.

1360
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,133
- YEAH?

1361
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:08,533
- YEAH, SURE.

1362
01:15:15,767 --> 01:15:18,667
- YOU KNOW JULIE MEANS
A LOT TO ME.

1363
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,233
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED IF I HADN'T MET HER.

1364
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,567
- YEAH, I-I CAN SEE THAT.

1365
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,733
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

1366
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:29,733
- YEAH, I GUESS.

1367
01:15:29,767 --> 01:15:32,567
DO YOU REALLY WONDER WHAT IT
WOULD BE LIKE

1368
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,300
IF SHE HAD PICKED YOU?

1369
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:38,267
- YEAH, SOMETIMES.

1370
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,333
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IF...

1371
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:43,400
YOU PICKED ME.

1372
01:15:46,133 --> 01:15:48,667
- JULIE COULDN'T HAVE
HANDLED IT.

1373
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,233
- SO YOU DID ALL THIS FOR
JULIE, THEN, HUH?

1374
01:15:53,267 --> 01:15:55,267
YEAH.

1375
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,167
TOWNHOUSE IN THE CITY,

1376
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,633
BEACHFRONT ESTATE.

1377
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:02,500
YEAH.

1378
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:06,267
THE SACRIFICES WE MAKE
FOR LOVE, HUH?

1379
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,767
THE BOAT IS THE CLINCHER,
THOUGH.

1380
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,400
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

1381
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:12,100
LOOK...

1382
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:15,533
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

1383
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:18,633
ANY ONE OF US WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING.

1384
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:23,033
IT'S NICE NOT TO BE SO
AMBITIOUS.

1385
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:25,167
IT LETS YOU RECOGNIZE
A REALLY GOOD THING

1386
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,733
WHEN IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR FACE.

1387
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:30,433
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS TRY
TO MAKE THINGS BAD?

1388
01:16:30,467 --> 01:16:33,133
CATHERINE'S A GOOD GIRL.

1389
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:34,600
BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT MORE.

1390
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:36,467
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE HAPPY?

1391
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,767
- IT'S NOT TRUE, I AM HAPPY.
- YOU'RE HAPPY?

1392
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:43,467
- I'M HAPPY.

1393
