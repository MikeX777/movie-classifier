1
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:53,605
[music playing]

2
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,849
[bombs exploding]

3
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:07,343
[gunfire]

4
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:29,951
[sirens]

5
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:30,849
Here you are mum.

6
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,022
Keep your chin up, mate.

7
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,023
Time bombing there, chums.

8
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,750
Get cracking.

9
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:37,580
Blimey.

10
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:54,114
And I came here for
piece and quiet.

11
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,080
What's up?

12
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:56,081
Delayed action.

13
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:57,427
All a dud.

14
00:01:57,531 --> 00:01:59,084
Corner of the hospital--
a 2,000 pounder.

15
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:00,292
All right, clear this area.

16
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:01,811
Every house within two blocks.
-Right.

17
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:02,812
You've reported it?

18
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,020
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:09,232
Bomb disposal--
crew's on its way now.

20
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:11,027
Many more patients
to get out, doctor?

21
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,028
Yeah, quite a few.

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,029
Around the back, Sir.

23
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,444
Like to have a look at it?

24
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,757
Mind looking at it most
stopping going off.

25
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,861
Get them all cleared out.

26
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:18,862
Good luck!

27
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:27,837
Yeah, we shall need it.

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,803
Everything ready, Sergeant?

29
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,046
Yes, Sir.

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,703
This way, Sir.

31
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:33,774
Went through a stone wall as if
it were a ruddy paper bag, Sir.

32
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:34,775
How long has it been down?

33
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,744
About 10 minutes, Sir.

34
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:39,745
SERGEANT: There it is, Sir.

35
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,195
For Lord's sake, be careful.

36
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,715
You're from the-- why,
Captain Stevenson, isn't it?

37
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:45,751
There you are.
All ready and waiting for you.

38
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,028
Drifted?

39
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:47,926
It didn't get a chance
to straighten out.

40
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:49,376
It must have been low.

41
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,273
CAPTAIN STEVENSON: We can't
take a chance moving it.

42
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,101
I'll deal with it here.

43
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,690
SOLDIER: Yes, Sir.

44
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:55,105
I want to go home.

45
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,762
Oh, Danny, you must be quiet.

46
00:02:56,866 --> 00:03:01,698
You must lie quite still.

47
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:02,906
Hello.

48
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,080
Hello.

49
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,909
Can't you get that child away?

50
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:07,048
I can't shift him.

51
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:08,464
He mustn't be moved.

52
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:26,999
He's got to be kept quite still.

53
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:29,933
Who's that down there?

54
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,866
Is it going to go off?

55
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,661
I want to go home!

56
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,663
That thing's not
going to hurt you.

57
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,218
You'll hurt yourself if
you don't keep still.

58
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,046
Remember what the doctor said.

59
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:40,012
I want to go home!

60
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,842
-Now, again--
-Danny?

61
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,050
Yes, Mister?

62
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:44,534
Did you ever have
your tonsil's out?

63
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,916
No, but I got a
sister what did.

64
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,642
Well, that's what I'm
doing to this fellow--

65
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,058
taking out his tonsils and
giving him a sore throat,

66
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,232
so he can't talk.

67
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,440
Why didn't you
take him away first?

68
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:55,476
Well, he came to
the hospital the same

69
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,029
as you and your sister.
So we've got to do it here.

70
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:57,858
That's only fair.

71
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,273
DANNY: But, Mister--

72
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:02,069
Now, Danny-- Danny, you
can help by keeping quiet.

73
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:03,657
I've got to listen
to his insides.

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,248
The quieter you keep,
the more I can listen.

75
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,870
Is there going to
be any more noise?

76
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:12,010
Shh-sh.

77
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:17,912
[church bells ringing]

78
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:18,913
Sergeant, all set.

79
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:19,880
All set, Sir.

80
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,847
2,000 pound, a new type.

81
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:29,786
Now removing fuse cap.

82
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,788
Fuse cap removed.

83
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:33,134
New type detonator head.

84
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,205
Time combination, delayed
action. tumbler not tripped.

85
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,793
Repeat.

86
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,761
Time combination, delayed
action, tumbler not tripped.

87
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:39,934
Right.

88
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:40,901
New type mounting.

89
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:45,492
Security pin.

90
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:47,079
Now removing security pin.

91
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,080
Mister?

92
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:49,910
Who are you talking to?

93
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,739
Friends of mine, Danny,
telling them what I'm doing.

94
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,776
Then if I do anything silly,
they can tell the next man

95
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,742
where I went wrong.

96
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:56,019
Why can't you
tell him yourself?

97
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:56,848
Quiet again, Danny.

98
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:57,780
Still as a mouse.

99
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:04,234
Removing pin.

100
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,581
Pin removed.

101
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:09,895
Detonator hasn't come away.

102
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,277
This is the ticklish bit.

103
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:27,119
Removing detonator.

104
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:34,920
Detonator removed.

105
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:39,960
OK, Sergeant.

106
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:40,995
All over?

107
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:41,893
All over.

108
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:42,963
Operation successful.

109
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:49,038
The patient died.

110
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,039
Well, Sergeant.

111
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,179
Good work, Sir.

112
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:53,594
Careful, new type.

113
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,183
Here's the Captain, now.

114
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:57,011
From the War Office, Sir.

115
00:05:57,115 --> 00:06:09,748
Very urgent.

116
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:10,266
You know my coat?

117
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,543
Yes, Sir.

118
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:13,787
Sorry, Sergeant,
you'll have to carry on.

119
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,928
The brass heads want me
for some reason or other.

120
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:17,929
Good luck.

121
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:36,188
Thank you, Sir.

122
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,052
[knocking]

123
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:42,747
Captain Stevenson, Sir.

124
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,301
Now, I'm Perry.

125
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,233
This is General Weymouth.

126
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:47,959
How do you do?

127
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:50,133
How do you do, Sir?

128
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:50,962
Have a cigarette.

129
00:06:51,065 --> 00:07:01,248
Thank you.

130
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:03,526
Well, Stevenson
before we begin,

131
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,666
just let's know if
we've got this right.

132
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,635
Your father was Colonel
Lawrence Stevenson.

133
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:11,223
That's right, killed
in 1916, in the war.

134
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,949
Yes, before that,
as a civilian,

135
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,193
he was consulting chemist
to the oil refineries

136
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:17,229
in [inaudible], in Romania.

137
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,852
You grew up there.

138
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,060
You were born there.

139
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,131
Yes, and I came to England
in school when I was 15.

140
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,788
After you left
school, you spent

141
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:27,619
two years in Germany--
The Berlin University--

142
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:28,689
chemical engineering?

143
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,140
Yes.

144
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,487
Well, now, don't you think
it's about time that we,

145
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,524
ah, you told Captain
Stevenson why we

146
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:37,180
asked him to come and see us?

147
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,734
Yes.

148
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:42,945
Well, Stevenson, the
fact is, the Nazis

149
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,707
are making poison gas on a
huge scale in a new factory.

150
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,848
In Czechoslovakia,
somewhere near Pilsen.

151
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:54,128
We've reason to believe they're
using a new formula-- fog gas.

152
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,268
Now we want to know exactly
what they're making,

153
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:57,856
and stop them making it.

154
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,928
In other words, we want someone
to get hold of the formula,

155
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,896
then blow the whole place
to blazes before they get

156
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,208
a chance to
distribute the stuff--

157
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:06,658
which might be at any moment.

158
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,626
PERRY: You speak
German fluently,

159
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,110
and Romanian like a native.

160
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,698
Yes.

161
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,872
You're a chemical expect, and
as things are at the moment,

162
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,564
you could get in
through Romania.

163
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,186
I'm afraid all I
know about spying

164
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,051
has been picked up from one or
two rather second class novels.

165
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,880
This is a sabotage job.

166
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,608
And a pretty long shot,
whatever way you look at it.

167
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:28,818
No one would blame you, if
you don't think got up to it.

168
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,302
When would you want
me to start, Sir?

169
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,235
Tonight.

170
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,754
Hello, Mother.

171
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,584
Where would you be off
to at such short notice?

172
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,620
Now, you know better than that.

173
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:39,208
Surely, you don't want me
to be a complete outsider

174
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,830
and give the lady away,

175
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:42,314
I'm not interested
in the lady, even

176
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,246
supposing she is from here.

177
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,247
Really?

178
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,973
I'm surprised at you.

179
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:47,768
There's been a special
messenger from the War Office

180
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,563
after you.

181
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,116
Hadn't you better find
out all about that first?

182
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,359
I have.

183
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:53,325
They want to make
it into a brigadier.

184
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:54,464
That's why I'm clearing out.

185
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,398
I can't stand the
responsibility.

186
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:01,161
You're not packing to go away
to someone-- or for very long.

187
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:02,542
A few days?

188
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:04,302
Oh, a bit longer then that.

189
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:05,993
A few weeks, perhaps.

190
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,788
Terry?

191
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:11,205
Don't you think I
deserve a holiday?

192
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:16,038
Is it far?

193
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:19,559
Fold that for me,
Darling, will you?

194
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:23,666
Will you be able to write?

195
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,910
You don't want me to
ask any questions?

196
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,049
That's about it.

197
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:31,053
Thank you.

198
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,710
Well, Duchess.

199
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,228
Your father used
to call me that.

200
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,610
Yes, I remember.

201
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:38,336
He did it the last time--

202
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:39,164
Shh.

203
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:41,270
Now, now.

204
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,584
[dog growling]

205
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,171
Hello, hello.

206
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:50,797
Percy thinks we're having a row.

207
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,558
I'm coming down to
store to see you go.

208
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:54,732
You always [inaudible].

209
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:55,318
No.

210
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:58,252
I'll check in.

211
00:09:58,356 --> 00:09:59,564
Stay here.

212
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:03,568
Stay here and sit down.

213
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,812
Will you tidy up for me?

214
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,711
Look at the mess I have made.

215
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,299
You always leave your
mother to tidy up, don't you?

216
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:14,924
Yes and she always does-- a
very bad thing for both of us.

217
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:22,173
Well, take care of yourself.

218
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:24,175
Now I'll turn up again before
you know where you are.

219
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:38,154
Be a good girl.

220
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:39,708
[door closes]

221
00:10:39,811 --> 00:11:00,107
[air plane engine revving]

222
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:50,710
I'd better get ready!

223
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:54,058
Please, Mister, if you please.

224
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:54,714
Oh, I'm sorry.

225
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:56,129
It's no good.

226
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,856
I've told you before,
we've no vacancies.

227
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,271
But please, Mister, we
think it is necessary

228
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,617
that I speak with you.

229
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,687
Now look here, old man,
if there was anything

230
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:03,619
I could do for you, I would.

231
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,724
But there's nothing doing.

232
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:05,725
We're full up.

233
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:06,760
Now leave me alone.

234
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:07,692
But please,Mister, work please.

235
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:08,693
Oh, confound it, man!

236
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,246
Clear out!

237
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:17,322
Oh-- I wondered lonely as a
cloud, that floats on high,

238
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:19,704
o'er vales and hills.

239
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:25,572
When all at once,
I saw a crowd.

240
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:29,610
A host of golden daffodils.

241
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,268
Number 38-- [inaudible].

242
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:52,772
8:00 tonight.

243
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,325
[WITH FOREIGN ACCENT]
Believe me, madam, with me,

244
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,947
you have nothing to fear.

245
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:57,224
I am discretion itself.

246
00:12:57,328 --> 00:13:00,020
Our love will be like
a secret symphony.

247
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:03,334
I am not as others, begging
for garters, locks of hair--

248
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,749
no, no.

249
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:07,200
Just give me some simple
little thing with nothing

250
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,270
personal about it all.

251
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,962
you know, gold cigarette

252
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,344
belt studs, Rolls
Royce, you know--

253
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:14,310
just some simple little thing.

254
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:15,173
[NO ACCENT]How's that?

255
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,209
How am I doing?

256
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,108
Grand, Romanian
iron guard as a life.

257
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,938
An officer, but not a gentlemen.

258
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,525
How well I knew them.

259
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,665
If you stay here in Romania,
you'd make a very good living.

260
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:25,805
Thank you very much.

261
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,255
Here's some more
about yourself.

262
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,567
Hmm?

263
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,602
Jan Tartu.

264
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:31,914
Hmm.

265
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:37,402
Enterprising chap, aren't I?

266
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:39,991
By the way, what happened
to the real Tartu?

267
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,751
He met with a fatal accident.

268
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,719
Oh, you fellows have been busy.

269
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,033
Here are young Tartu's papers.

270
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:50,760
His membership card of
the Romanian Iron Guard.

271
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,107
Until you cross the
border into Hungary,

272
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,867
this passport describes
you as a Greek merchant,

273
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:55,835
Petalis, a mythical character.

274
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:57,837
Am I all right as
a Greek merchant?

275
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,873
Well, you will be when
you get your overcoat on.

276
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,461
But don't worry,
you're all right.

277
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:04,429
Until you cross into Hungary,
everything's fixed for you.

278
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,983
But once you cross the
border into Hungary,

279
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:08,226
you must destroy
that Greek passport

280
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,160
and present yourself to
the German consul at Teget.

281
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,161
Teget.

282
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,680
Under the name,
Muller, Dr. Muller.

283
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,199
Dr. Muller.

284
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:17,166
Now you must get your visa
for Czechoslovakia from him.

285
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,720
We'll be standing by
tomorrow night, as arranged.

286
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:20,825
And then from Teget
onwards, well,

287
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,654
we can't be much use to you.

288
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,277
I must struggle
along on my own, eh?

289
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,071
Yes.

290
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,970
It's not going to be easy.

291
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:29,938
One last memory test--
I don't want to take

292
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,836
any unnecessary chances.

293
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,493
The whole thing
is one big chance.

294
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:36,806
Now when you finally get to
Pilsen, the man you contact is?

295
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,291
Peter Valek, the shoemaker.

296
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,154
His address?

297
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:40,362
38 Reichstrata.

298
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,019
Good.

299
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:45,056
Now remember, he's
our only remaining

Czech underground,

301
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,231
so you realize his importance?

302
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:47,956
Quite.

00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:50,639
What is it?

What is it?

00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:52,917
Friend of the
Reich, Dr. Muller?

312
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,091
Yes, yes, yes.

313
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,713
Please, please,
please let me in.

314
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:56,714
They're on my heels.
Please!

315
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:57,853
Why do you wait?

316
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:16,872
All right, all
right, all right.

317
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,391
-Friend of the Reich, eh?
-Yes.

318
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:19,357
I need proof of that.

319
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:20,289
Proof.

320
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:26,916
Please.

321
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,848
Romanian, huh?

322
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,022
I ran the border.

323
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,644
The Hungarian
patrol and sweep are

324
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,646
no better than my own
people if they've caught me.

325
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,785
No.

326
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:34,821
They tried.

327
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:36,719
I left one with a broken jaw.

328
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:43,174
Come with me.

329
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:44,831
What if they should
see me come here?

330
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,074
They were on my heels.

331
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,352
This house is German territory.

332
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:56,843
Please?

333
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:57,844
Heil, Hitler.

334
00:16:57,947 --> 00:16:58,707
Heil, Hitler.

340
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:15,551
Who sent you here to me?

341
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,243
Colonel Von Ritter, at
your legation in Bucharest.

342
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:28,599
You have his letter there.

343
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:30,152
Hmm.

344
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:34,156
He some nice things about you--
but damaging to the Reich,

345
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,196
if this had fallen
into the wrong hands.

346
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,783
Strange he would give
you such a letter

347
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,095
to carry across two
borders when you

348
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,097
could have used the telephone.

349
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,203
Maybe he thought
the telephone unwise.

350
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:49,827
Maybe.

351
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,140
Sit down.

352
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,728
Colonel Von Ritter,
German Legation Bucharest.

353
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:57,731
Dr. Muller, consul, speaking.

354
00:17:57,835 --> 00:17:59,181
You know Colonel
Von Ritter well?

355
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,218
Oh, but of course, of
course-- like a brother.

356
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,979
All these months we worked
together-- hand in glove,

357
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,118
shoulder to shoulder.

358
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:05,774
You really think
that is necessary?

359
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,878
I do.

360
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:07,707
Most necessary.

361
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,639
Do I bore you?

362
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:09,467
No, no.

363
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:10,917
Not in the least.

364
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,884
I only worry that you should go
to so much unnecessary trouble

365
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:13,989
on my behalf.

366
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,473
Don't you worry about that.

367
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:17,717
Where do you intend
to go from here?

368
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,305
Well, Von Ritter
thought I could be

369
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:22,722
of use in one of the munition
or chemical plants in Pilsen.

370
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,033
He thought I could
be of great use.

371
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,001
They need skilled men,
I am a skilled man,

372
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,416
I'm a skilled chemist.

373
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,763
My only wish is to serve
the Furher-- heil, Hitler.

374
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,663
Von Ritter thought you could
give me Czechoslovakian visa

375
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:36,011
and recommend me to the
authorities in Pilsen.

376
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,702
Yes, he says that here.

377
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:38,841
Hello?

378
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:41,465
Is that Colonel Von Ritter?

379
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:44,882
This is Heinrich Muller,
consul at Teget, Hungary.

380
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:48,299
Yes, Teget.

381
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:49,231
What?

382
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,716
I can't hear you clearly.

383
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,029
Well, I'm sorry Colonel,
to get you out of bed,

384
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,927
but this seems important.

385
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:57,481
Yes.

386
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:01,968
I have a man here, an escaped
Iron Guard, Jan Tartu.

387
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:05,972
Did you give him a
letter to deliver to me?

388
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:08,768
Yes.

389
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:14,463
He's here now.

390
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:18,743
Oh, then you did
give him a letter.

391
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,159
I'm sorry, Colonel.

392
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:21,160
Yes, perhaps I should have
rung you in the morning,

393
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:23,990
but it seemed so important.

394
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:28,063
I assure, Colonel,
I'm very sorry.

395
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,238
I'm sorry, Colonel.

396
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:31,756
I'm very sorry, Colonel.

397
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,379
Do everything you can for him!

398
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,863
Good!

399
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:35,864
He's convinced.

400
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,348
Great.

401
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:38,625
You sounded like Dr. Goebbels
with a bilious attack.

402
00:19:38,729 --> 00:20:04,996
Well, let's wind up
and get out of here.

403
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,724
[train engine whistling]

404
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:10,347
Passports!

405
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:17,112
Passports!

406
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,147

408
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,012
Can I stop at a shoemaker?

409
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,290
Why?

410
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:23,739
Well, look, look,
look-- it's terrible.

411
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:24,706
I can't walk about like this.

412
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,328
I might me a girl, you know.

413
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:27,985
Well man, you can stop anywhere
you please-- at your own risk.

414
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:28,986
Aha!

415
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:30,125
She's worth the risk.

416
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,471
Please, sorry, my
papers, please!

417
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:32,886
If don't register in an
hour, you'll have very

418
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,198
little space to walk in at all.

419
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:52,009
I'll be registered
in half an hour.

421
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:01,846
Heil, Hitler!

422
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,158
Heil, Hitler.

423
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,780
Can you repair this
please, while I wait?

424
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:07,956
I hope so, if you will bear
with the hearts of an old man.

425
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,544
Old man?
Ho, ho.

426
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:10,924
No women folk about
in your old age?

427
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:12,236
No family, hmm?

428
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,241
Well, I, too, "Wander
lonely as a cloud."

429
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:20,209
"That floats on high
o'er vales and hills."

I saw a crowd."

00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,700
"A host of golden daffodils."

432
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:30,081
We are alone here.

433
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:31,151
Where are you from?

434
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:32,912
[inaudible] Bucharest.

435
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:33,809
And your mission?

436
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:35,190
The new gas plant.

437
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,054
I shall need help
from the underground.

438
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,124
Tonight, at--

439
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:39,919
Eh, this shoe is
splitting here!

440
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:41,023
You, repair it, please.

441
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:41,921
[bell chimes]

442
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:45,131
Quick work, you people.

443
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:45,959
Heil, Hitler.

444
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:48,514
Heil, Hitler.

Czech pig!

446
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:55,037
In the name of the
Reich, I arrest you.

447
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:56,142
Eh, what for?

448
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:59,076
Treason.

449
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,698
What are you doing?

450
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:01,699
Your papers?

451
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,183
Captain Jan Tartu.

452
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,253
I am Guard of Romania.

453
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,946
So, what are you doing here?

454
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,120
I've only just arrived in
Pilsen, I needed a shoemaker.

455
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:10,536
You, Guinea.

456
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:11,847
Well at least I shall
never have to touch

457
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:16,024
the feet of any more like you!

458
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,199
Take him out.

459
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,788
What's wrong with you?

460
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:25,516
One likes to admit they have
a certain rat-like courage.

461
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,069
It will be drained from
him till the last drop.

462
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:28,243
Good.

463
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,279
I see you have
not yet registered.

464
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,729
Go to Police
Headquarters immediately.

465
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,075
Certainly, Sir.

466
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:33,904
Heil, Hitler.

467
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:44,777
Heil, Hitler.

468
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,123
Permit for work.

469
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:47,883
Permit for food.

Permit for clothing.

Police identity card.

472
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:52,543
It is an offence to lose them.

473
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:56,098
Orderly, a room at
the Palacek House.

474
00:22:56,202 --> 00:23:01,241
You will report to Inspector
Vogel, who also lives there.

475
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,691
Inspector-- a foreman
at the Skoda works?

476
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,106
INSPECTOR: Correct.
-But that is ridiculous!

477
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,142
Ridiculous?

478
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:06,315
What do you mean?

479
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,800
I am not an ordinary
munition worker.

480
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,078
Dr. Muller's letter tells
you that-- and I tell you!

481
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,528
All my life, I
worked at chemistry.

482
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,806
It is not much, I ask not
much to serve the Fuhrer

483
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:14,945
in the best way I can.

484
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:15,911
That is only common sense.

485
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:17,361
That is only reasonable.

486
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:18,811
I am an expert, but an
expect only at chemistry!

487
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:19,984
It

488
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:21,745
You will work
where you're told.

489
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:22,884
That is Party orders.

490
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:26,715
I have only one wish--
to serve the Fuhrer.

491
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:27,267
Heil, Hitler.

492
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,821
Heil, Hitler.

493
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,858
Don't worry, Tartu,
you'll have an easy time

494
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:33,722
working with the Czechs.

495
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:36,000
Every now and then,
some of them try

496
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:38,278
and interfere with production.

497
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:42,317
Keep your eyes open and
you will be well rewarded.

498
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,319
I can promise you that.

499
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,285
That's all.

500
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:47,149
Thank you, Sir.

501
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,117
Yes, I will keep my eyes open.

502
00:23:49,220 --> 00:24:03,821
Yes, I can promise you that.

503
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:04,408
Sound your horn.

General Von Reizen,
Commandant of this area.

Ho, ho.

Heil, Hitler!

509
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:17,179
Good morning.

510
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:18,974
This is Captain Tartu.

511
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:20,079
He is billeted here.

512
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:23,289
We have no more rooms.

513
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:25,325
He will occupy your room.

514
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:29,157
You will move into the kitchen.

515
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,301
And be quick about it!

516
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:53,595
I can inspect the work
while you're here, Sir.

517
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,942
Do not bother to
remove your things.

518
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,634
I will take the kitchen.

519
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,049
Oh, but the soldier ordered--

520
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:01,948
The soldier-- tch-- I will
take the responsibility.

521
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,225
That is very kind of you.

522
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:04,641
Not at all.

523
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:05,711
If your room suited
me, I should take it.

524
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:07,160
Oh yes.

525
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:09,853
But it has no private entrance,
and likewise, no private exit.

526
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:12,752
At the kitchen, there
is a back door, mm?

527
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:15,237
Well, I am, though I
need hardly tell you,

528
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:16,860
you've only to look at me.

529
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:20,001
I am a man for the ladies, or
rather, the ladies are for me.

530
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:23,832
And with a lady at that
door she comes, she goes.

531
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:26,766
And the whole wide
world, nobody knows.

532
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,387
Very helpful.

533
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:29,010
Very encouraging.

534
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:31,702
You understand.

544
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,755
Is she beautiful?

545
00:25:49,858 --> 00:25:52,516
The German officers think so.

A Czech.

548
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,246
She has found it
convenient to forget it.

549
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:04,321
I'll take it to the kitchen.

550
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:05,805
Ah, Captain Tartu.

551
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:06,357
Heil, Hitler.

552
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,636
Heil, Hitler.

553
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:10,085
They called me
from Headquarters.

554
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:12,605
I'm to take you to Skoda works.

555
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:14,296
I'm at your service.

556
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,540
And I-- at yours.

557
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:19,163
MARUSCHKA: Anna, Anna!

558
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,650
Anna Palacek!

559
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,203
What have you got
to say for yourself?

560
00:26:24,306 --> 00:26:25,756
Why, I don't know what you mean.

561
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,310
Don't stand there flapping
your tongue about, answer me!

562
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:30,934
Why haven't these boots
been saddle soaped?

563
00:26:31,037 --> 00:26:33,005
And don't tell me
you can't get any,

564
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:36,284
because I might very easily have
some wrung out of your hide!

565
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:37,803
Maruschka, wonderful!

566
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:39,080
You're just as
beautiful when you're

567
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:40,909
angry as when you're pleased.

568
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:42,014
Thank you, Arthur.

569
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:44,568
How charming.

570
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:47,329
Pardon, Captain Jan Tartu
of the Romanian Iron Guard.

571
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,262
The inspector omitted
to introduce me,

572
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,574
I can well understand.

573
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:51,782
His attention was elsewhere.

574
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:53,577
But I would go further than he.

575
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:56,753
For me, your angry is
not only beautiful,

576
00:26:56,856 --> 00:27:00,308
it is a burning flame, in
itself a fitting symbol

577
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,999
of the New Order.

578
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:06,003
Really Captain, your words are
as fantastic as your clothes.

579
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:08,937
Maruschka-- you're having
coffee with me this afternoon?

580
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:09,835
I'm sorry, Arthur.

581
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:11,250
What about dinner
then, tonight?

582
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:12,700
There's a new orchestra
at the casino.

583
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:14,287
My time is not entirely my own.

584
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:15,357
Will you ask me again?

585
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:16,911
Of course.

586
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:17,877
Will you, Arthur?

587
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:33,168
Of course.

588
00:27:33,272 --> 00:27:34,653
Elusive.

589
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:40,279
As elusive as she is desirable.

590
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:44,593
Who would not be a commandant?

591
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,837
My orders are to
take you to the Works.

592
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:47,942
Are you ready?

593
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:49,219
Perfectly.

594
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:50,082
Fantastic.

595
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,428
What?

596
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:52,878
What she said about
my clothes-- fantastic.

597
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:54,086
Though perhaps in
this country, they

598
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:55,604
would seem a little strange.

599
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,813
What do you think?

600
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,918
For me, I must always
be well dressed.

601
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:01,749
You know-- just a
simple little suit.

602
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:02,957
You think I should
wear something else?

603
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,890
At the works you
will get a uniform.

604
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:05,822
Good.

605
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,133
I'm always at my
best in a uniform.

606
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:07,962
Good.

607
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:48,968
I'm ready.

608
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:51,868
Now, the workers in this
room operate on 12 hour shift.

609
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:53,179
I needn't tell you
that you might think

610
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:54,594
that's the maximum efficiency.

611
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:55,354
They're the born laggers.

612
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:56,113
They look it.

613
00:28:56,217 --> 00:29:03,293
[alarm sounding]

614
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:04,501
What is happening?

615
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:07,676
Somebody's been
detected at sabotage.

616
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:34,945
[footsteps creaking]

617
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:36,084
One of them is a
counterfeit, Sir!

618
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:36,809
I see.

619
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:39,122
Where did you get it?

620
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:40,606
Who made it?

621
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:48,131
You realize what
this means for you?

622
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:52,066
Of course, if you have
any accomplices here,

623
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:55,690
whose names you
might care to tell,

624
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:05,389
things might go easier for you.

625
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:09,738
Take her away.

626
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,292
Hopelessly stupid.

627
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,673
None of them ever tell.

628
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:14,674
How many shells went through?

629
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:16,055
About 600, Sir.

630
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:16,711
Put them away.

631
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,988
They're useless.

632
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,162
SOLDIER: I'm afraid
Sir, it's too late.

633
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:20,784
They are gone.

634
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:23,304
Check every shell on this line
before resuming production.

635
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,893
Yes, Sir.

636
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,377
How will you deal with her?

637
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:37,283
She'll be shot immediately.

638
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:38,284
It's

639
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:40,183
All right.

640
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:41,770
A favorite?

641
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,739
She lives at the house, a
daughter of the Palecek woman.

642
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,567
Attractive, oh yes.

643
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:46,775
Very.

644
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,053
But not to be compared
with the other.

645
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,158
There is something
about a beautiful woman

646
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:51,021
in a riding habit.

647
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:51,884
Captain--

648
00:30:51,988 --> 00:30:53,092
Hmm?

649
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:54,404
I think it will be a good
thing for all concerned

650
00:30:54,507 --> 00:30:55,681
if I gave you some advise.

651
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,303
But, please.

652
00:30:57,407 --> 00:31:00,928
There is a rule, a strict rule,
that Party members should not

653
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:04,932
fraternize with Czech women.

654
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:08,314
Then this morning, the
commandant, he break the rule.

655
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,075
You force me to be blunt.

656
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:14,631
My dear Vogel, I don't
force you-- you are blunt.

657
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,978
Keep off Maruschka.

658
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:19,878
You mean the commandant
might be annoyed?

659
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:23,053
Or perhaps the inspector?

660
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:24,089
[shot]

661
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:29,128
[screaming]

662
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:30,612
Truly, inspector,
at least there's

663
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:34,271
one less left to argue about.

664
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:48,044
[alarm sounding]

665
00:31:48,147 --> 00:32:06,096
[whistling]

666
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,752
Mm.

667
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:07,960
Smells good.

668
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,651
What is it?
-Veal Paprika.

669
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:10,618
Ah, delicious!

670
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:30,431
I shall look forward.

671
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,122
Sorry I'm late, Mother.

672
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:42,650
Be down to help you in a minute.

673
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:54,903
[banging on door]

674
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,388
How many women
live in this house?

675
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:57,182
Three.

676
00:32:57,285 --> 00:32:58,424
Who are they?

677
00:32:58,528 --> 00:33:00,909
Myself, my daughter, and
Maruschka Lanova, a border.

678
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,394
Are the other two in now?

679
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,120
Why, only my daughter.

680
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,191
Maruschka Lanova has
not yet returned.

681
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:08,641
How long has your
daughter been in?

682
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,195
I don't know.

683
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:10,919
I, I--

684
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,231
May be of assistance?

685
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:13,922
Captain Jan Tartu,
Romanian Iron Guard,

686
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,855
now foreman at the Skoda Works.

687
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,098
What has happened?

688
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:18,755
A German officer has
been killed nearby

689
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,101
in the [inaudible]
a few minutes ago.

690
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:20,757
Murdered?

691
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,758
By some woman.

692
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:22,724
She was seen running away.

693
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:23,691
Escaped?

694
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,037
So far.

695
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:28,868
I ask you-- how long has
your daughter been in?

696
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:29,697
I don't know.

697
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,663
I, I--

698
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,320
Ah, but I know.

699
00:33:32,424 --> 00:34:00,038
I will bring her down.

700
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:01,832
Listen.

701
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:05,353
Do as I tell you.

702
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:06,113
A German officer--

703
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:07,217
Yes, I've heard about it.

704
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:08,667
What have you?

705
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,048
JAN TARTU: You Czech's seem to
think you can do what you like,

706
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:11,187
but we'll show you.
Yes, yes.

707
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,084
[crash]

708
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:13,396
You can stay with the woman.

709
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:15,639
JAN TARTU: [inaudible]
Don't think you can

710
00:34:15,743 --> 00:34:16,675
hide anything from me, my girl.

711
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:17,710
No!

712
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:21,680
I tell you that is impossible.

713
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:23,164
Can't search your
room-- I'll show you

714
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:25,028
if I can't search your room.

715
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:27,686
You Czechs have got to
be taught to cooperate.

716
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:29,446
An officer of the Reich
has been murdered.

717
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,930
And if you have a gun here--

718
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,449
Nevermind, Romanian.

719
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:37,937
I'll handle this.

720
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,768
How long have you
been in the house?

721
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:41,872
About half an hour.

722
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:42,701
That's right.

723
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:44,668
I saw her.

724
00:34:44,772 --> 00:34:46,981
But she came in
through the back door.

725
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:53,160
I often come in by the kitchen.

726
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:56,370
Are you sure she came
in half an hour ago?

727
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:57,716
I'm certain of it.

728
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,787
And now that I
remember, Major, she

729
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,754
had a funny look on her face.

730
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:03,273
I congratulate you, Captain.

731
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:06,449
your powers of discernment
are remarkable,

732
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:08,278
but your memory is faulty.

733
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:10,211
Did you hear us say
that this murder took

734
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:13,697
place less than 15 minutes ago?

735
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:14,319
Yes.

736
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:15,734
What?

737
00:35:15,837 --> 00:35:19,945
Are you sure?

738
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:21,774
Captain Tartu will
never be a candidate

739
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:28,988
for our military intelligence.

740
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:30,335
All and the same.

741
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:32,130
Don't you ever dare tell
a member of the Party

742
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:43,037
that he can't search your room.

743
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,109
I suggest you spend your
first evening studying

744
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:49,699
what's contained in
those-- Party program,

745
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:51,494
behavior, future aims.

746
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:53,944
All that's interpreted
by the Fuhrer himself.

747
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:56,119
It will be an inspiration.

748
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,776
If anyone calls, I've gone
to the council meeting

749
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:58,811
at the bar house.

750
00:35:58,915 --> 00:35:59,743
Yes, Inspector.

751
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:00,503
Heil, Hitler.

752
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:07,682
Heil, Hitler.

753
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:16,001
I think our Fuhrer must use as
many pigeons as he does men.

754
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:20,108
You saved my life.

755
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,628
We cannot understand why.

756
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:29,497
For whatever reason, I
shall always owe you mine.

757
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,499
In times like
these, you will never

758
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:35,848
know who your friends are.

759
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:37,195
Who are you?

760
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:39,507
I'm here on a mission.

761
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:42,165
I've come a long way,
that all I can tell you.

762
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:44,823
But it is so important.

763
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:46,652
After what you have done.

764
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,309
Pavla, you can help me.

765
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:52,002
You must know other Czechs as
brave and loyal as you are.

766
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:54,764
I must contact the
underground, understand?

767
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:55,730
The underground?

768
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:56,904
Yes.

769
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,665
I can't tell you
how urgent it is.

770
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:01,184
Every hour counts.

771
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:01,978
Tonight.

772
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:04,774
If you can.

773
00:37:04,877 --> 00:37:08,847
I don't know.

774
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,470
I'll see what I can do.

775
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:15,716
You see--

776
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,891
Oh, so you're home for once.

777
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:35,287
Come upstairs and
take my boots off.

778
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:40,948
This Maruschka, tell
me something about her.

779
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,294
She boards here.

780
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:46,056
She seems a girl of
means, of education.

781
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,266
Her father owned a
big textile factory.

782
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,957
My husband works for him.

783
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,062
Is her father alive?

784
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,513
He and my husband
are both dead.

785
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:55,376
Oh, I'm sorry.

786
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,655
I'm very sorry.

787
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:00,761
But this intimacy with
high-ranking German officers,

788
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:05,593
rather a strange transfer
of affections, isn't it?

789
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:08,009
Some women are lonely only
to their own breed, Captain.

790
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:09,942
Yes, yes, I will.

791
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:11,703
Pavla, listen--

792
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:12,842
I can't talk now.

793
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:13,912
She wants to see you.

794
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:14,740
Maruschka?

795
00:38:14,844 --> 00:38:15,879
Yes, up in her room.

796
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:16,777
Now?

797
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,123
Yes.

798
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:19,124
Command performance, eh?

799
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:31,999
Well, well, what can I lose?

800
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,863
[knocking]

801
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:35,934
Come in?

802
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:37,142
Fraulein.

803
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:38,730
Oh, Captain, Tartu.

804
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:41,180
Never have I climbed stairs
with greater anticipation.

805
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:42,561
I see you're incorrigible.

806
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:44,356
Have a cigarette and
give me one, will you?

807
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:54,987
Please.

808
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:56,851
Thank you.

809
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:59,267
Sit down, Captain.

810
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,200
I detest being forced
into apologies,

811
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:02,961
but it seems I owe you one.

812
00:39:03,064 --> 00:39:04,480
I can hardly believe my ears.

813
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,240
Not only beautiful,
but unexpected.

814
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,206
A woman of surprises.

815
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,623
It is too much, too much.

816
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,418
Well, General Von
Reisend, the commandant.

817
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:12,867
I know.

818
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:16,526
He was telling me of the work
of your Iron Guard in Romania.

819
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,769
Very clever.

820
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:21,566
And very courageous.

821
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:22,843
I don't think you
warranted my rudeness,

822
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,983
so hereby, I apologize.

823
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:27,123
And hereby, I
accept your apology.

824
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:28,745
And what is more, I
too, can be generous.

825
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:31,161
There was, I admit it,
something in what you said.

826
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:32,922
You are a woman of taste.

827
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:34,268
No, just bad
tempered before lunch.

828
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,270
No, no-- a woman of taste.

829
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,135
You like me better
as I am now, eh?

830
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:40,861
Infinitely.

831
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:44,520
Ah, but I see a doubt, a
misgiving shadow in those eyes.

832
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:45,141
I know.

833
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:48,316
The pomade, yes?

834
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,042
Never again do I swallow
myself with the pomade.

835
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:51,906
From now on, it is an offence.

836
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,149
Never should it be
said that Captain

837
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:55,358
Tartu relied on the hair.

838
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:56,255
No!

839
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,915
You shall see me
as I am-- almost.

840
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:03,193
Almost?

841
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:04,747
Why not quite?

842
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,920
Who know?
It is possible.

843
00:40:06,024 --> 00:40:09,199
We shall see.

844
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,960
What on earth is that?

845
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:11,961
Your dinner.

846
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:13,307
Dinner!

847
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,309
Water, milk, and
dried up cheese?

848
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,829
Where's that veal paprika?

849
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:18,726
The butcher had no veal--

850
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,072
More whining.

851
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:22,247
You just get it out of
here before I'm sick.

852
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,043
What a way to live.

853
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:30,704
Well, it seems I shall have
to go elsewhere for my dinner.

854
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:34,052
Will you give me the
pleasure of taking you?

855
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:35,640
Why, yes.

856
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:37,745
In fact, I rather
hoped you'd ask me.

857
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,298
Can I have half an
hour to get dressed?

858
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:41,231
Nothing could be better,
for in that half hour,

859
00:40:41,335 --> 00:40:43,855
I, too, have most
important business.

860
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:44,890
May one ask, what?

861
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:45,822
I have to remove the pomade.

862
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:47,721
Heil, Hitler!

863
00:40:47,824 --> 00:41:03,046
[music playing]

864
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,048
Maruschka!

865
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:06,049
Hello, Little One!

866
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:07,050
Maruschka!

867
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:10,295
Paul.

868
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:12,055
Every officer in the room.

869
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,850
You're not enjoying
your evening.

870
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,025
Oh, yes, but we're
watched by too many eyes.

871
00:41:16,128 --> 00:41:17,578
What's wrong with that?

872
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,235
Well, I looked forward
to this first time.

873
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:22,238
I thought it might be, like
you, rather unexpected.

874
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:23,446
Unexpected?

875
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,344
Mm-mm.

876
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:27,070
Away from my own country,
I'm a rather lonely man.

877
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:28,969
You're a very beautiful woman.

878
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:32,420
I grabbed at this evening like
a drowning man who needs help.

879
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:33,974
Help?

880
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,354
Mm-mm.

881
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:38,979
Every lonely man
needs a woman's help.

882
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,912
I hoped I might be
myself with you.

883
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,983
Instead, I dance around
like a performing animal,

884
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:45,364
watched by a grinning audience.

885
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,228
This evening is not yet over.

886
00:41:47,332 --> 00:41:52,164
Outside it is
moonlight and quiet.

887
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:53,338
Let me take you.

888
00:41:53,441 --> 00:42:06,869
Take me back to our table.

889
00:42:06,972 --> 00:42:07,904
No?

890
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:09,009
-No, no.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

891
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,389
Why?

892
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:11,770
I feel in the mood for
talk, for real talk--

893
00:42:11,874 --> 00:42:12,702
an exchange of confidences,
of hopes and fears.

894
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:13,703
This helps.

895
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,256
Well, you've done
a lot of talking.

896
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,227
You've told me the life
story of Jan Tartu.

897
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:24,024
What do you think of it?

898
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,957
Shall I tell you the truth?

899
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,614
Please!

900
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:29,374
I don't know what to think.

901
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:30,513
It was very highly colored.

902
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:33,136
But men will do
desperate things,

903
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,725
out of love for their country.

904
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:38,314
Or for their faith
in the New Order.

905
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:41,006
Why yes, of course.

906
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:47,599
Or for there love of freedom.

907
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:51,810
You know, Captain Tartu,
without the pomade,

908
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:53,191
there is something very
different about you.

909
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:58,058
Away from Vogel
and the commandant,

910
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,819
I would say the same about you.

911
00:43:00,923 --> 00:43:03,063
My family have lost
everything and owe much.

912
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,099
I want to get it back.

913
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:09,138
That's why I risk my reputation
with our German visitors.

914
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:11,312
You risk something
of your reputation

915
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:14,971
as a good Nazi in your
little plot with Pavla.

916
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:15,938
Huh?

917
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,422
Mm.

918
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:20,598
There was a whole pot of
veal paprika in the kitchen

919
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:25,188
and you knew it, and
Pavla knew you knew it.

920
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:31,747
I'm not such a fool as Captain
Tartu must sometimes appear.

921
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:51,594
You may take me
into the moonlight.

922
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:53,803
Pavla told you everything?

923
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:56,254
Everything she knew.

924
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:57,980
Who are you?

925
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,534
Not yet.

926
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:05,332
You know Peter
Valek, the shoemaker.

927
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,887
He was my only contact.

928
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:10,889
You know, you're taking
a big chance on me.

929
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:14,306
I'm taking a big chance
on what's behind your eyes.

930
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:20,140
Look at me.

931
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:28,631
Will you do the same with me?

932
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:32,048
My country is being
tortured to death--

933
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:35,051
if I were to do anything
to increase that suffering.

934
00:44:35,155 --> 00:44:36,846
I'm here to help.

935
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:42,024
You must believe that.

936
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:44,820
Do you want me to put you in
touch with the underground?

937
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:46,304
As soon as possible.

938
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:49,065
Tomorrow.

939
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:55,278
When you return from the Works.

940
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:57,004
Well.

941
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:07,566
You were right about this
evening-- unexpected.

942
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,845
I believe in you.

943
00:45:09,948 --> 00:45:12,606
You give me new
hope and courage.

944
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,297
It's the courage
of people like you

945
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:17,059
who make it all worth
while-- something

946
00:45:17,162 --> 00:45:20,821
to hang onto in this mad world.

947
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:27,276
Life and laughter and love--
they'll come back, if we do

948
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:29,209
hang on.

949
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:32,799
They'll come back.

950
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:36,009
The moon and moonlight--
that doesn't change.

951
00:45:36,112 --> 00:45:40,220
It's about the only
thing that hasn't.

952
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:43,775
I sat under that
same moon at home.

953
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:45,156
Home?

954
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:46,778
My mother's garden.

955
00:45:46,882 --> 00:45:52,750
Wild roses in the hedge, the
river at her feet, and life

956
00:45:52,853 --> 00:46:00,896
ahead to do what we'd like with.

957
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:02,276
Queer to be talking
to you like this

958
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,178
in this little circle of peace.

959
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:10,664
Couldn't we pretend in this
little circle for a little

960
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:18,120
while, there's no war we're
free again, our lives our

961
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:19,362
own to do what we liked with.

962
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:20,881
Yes.

963
00:46:20,985 --> 00:46:23,056
Let's pretend.

964
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:27,301
You know that fellow
Tartu, remember him?

965
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:28,268
Do I?

966
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:29,821
Mm.

967
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:31,616
Oh, yes, yes.

968
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:34,412
Well, he and I had
one thing in common--

969
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:39,382
we both think [WITH ACCENT]
you're a very beautiful woman.

970
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:40,970
I'm glad.

971
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:45,941
Though I don't very much
care what Tartu thinks.

972
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:49,185
I wonder what he'd
do if he were here.

973
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:50,014
Tartu?

974
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:50,669
Mm.

975
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,016
What do you think?

976
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:53,224
What do you think?

977
00:46:53,327 --> 00:47:14,624
Oh, I'd expect he'd do
some simple little thing.

978
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:18,145
Now, Captain Tartu, things
aren't quite as easy as that.

979
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,181
Maruschka, are you?

980
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:20,699
Oh, Otto, I'm glad you've come.

981
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:21,597
Good evening, inspector.

982
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,632
What were you saying?

983
00:47:22,736 --> 00:47:23,461
Has this fellow been trying--

984
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:24,220
Oh, no, no, Otto.

985
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,566
Nothing, really.

986
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,982
Those fools at the house
sent me up a dinner

987
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:30,157
which was utterly uneatable,
so I had to come out.

988
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:33,022
I pressed our Romanian
gallant here into service,

989
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:36,992
and the result was partly my
fault and partly the champagne.

990
00:47:37,095 --> 00:47:37,751
Oh, Lady, I'm desolate.

991
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,994
I'd hoped it was my fault.

992
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,581
Really, Captain,
you flatter yourself.

993
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:44,137
Otto, let's find
a table inside?

994
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,070
I gave you some pamphlets.

995
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:58,979
Go and read them.

996
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:05,330
[sobbing]

997
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:07,367
[WHISPERING] Pavla!

998
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:11,060
Pavla, Darling, Darling, don't.

999
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:13,304
Don't cry, sweetheart.

1000
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:14,719
No.

1001
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:16,859
Couldn't you sleep?

1002
00:48:16,963 --> 00:48:19,172
I couldn't get back sooner.

1003
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:21,450
That fool, Otto, turned up.

1004
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:24,315
I shouldn't have
done what I did today.

1005
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,938
I put all of you in danger.

1006
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:29,044
No, Darling.

1007
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:30,631
It's been over three
months since that beast

1008
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:32,012
started telling the
others to be executed.

1009
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:35,291
I shouldn't have let
him live that long.

1010
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:36,879
I know, Daring.

1011
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:39,778
But Karl got his
revenge today, because I

1012
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:41,159
had Karl's own revolver.

1013
00:48:41,263 --> 00:48:44,645
And he fell right in
the gutter-- right

1014
00:48:44,749 --> 00:48:46,854
on his face in the filth!

1015
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:56,416
Shh!

1016
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:06,081
I'm all right.

1017
00:49:06,184 --> 00:49:09,084
What happened
about the Romanian?

1018
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:10,982
You were right
about that, Darling.

1019
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:13,191
I'm going to speak to the
council members in the morning.

1020
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:14,572
I'm glad.

1021
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:20,026
I knew I could trust him
the moment I saw him.

1022
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:21,959
Strange, isn't it?

1023
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:27,102
There's something about him.

1024
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:31,830
Yes, there's
something about him.

1025
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:38,113
He's so strong and honest
and gentle, at the same time.

1026
00:49:38,216 --> 00:49:43,152
Maruschka, I've never heard
you talk about a man like that

1027
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:45,120
before.

1028
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:47,432
What's happened?

1029
00:49:47,536 --> 00:49:50,953
You're falling in love.

1030
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:52,437
Am I?

1031
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,300
Yes.

1032
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:57,132
I think I am.

1033
00:49:57,235 --> 00:49:58,616
I'm so glad.

1034
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,343
You know when you are.

1035
00:50:01,446 --> 00:50:05,071
I remember Karl.

1036
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:06,693
I killed the man
who killed my Karl.

1037
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,902
It hasn't brought
Karl back to me.

1038
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,903
Killing, killing, killing!

1039
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:10,938
There's nothing left!

1040
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:11,939
Nothing!

1041
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:12,733
[sobbing]

1042
00:50:12,837 --> 00:50:15,322
No, no, no.

1043
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:18,636
Pavla, Pavla, Darling.

1044
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:30,441
There.

1045
00:50:30,544 --> 00:50:57,226
Do your sleeping at home!

1046
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:02,749
[alarm sounding]

1047
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,682
Well, what is it?

1048
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:10,722
One moment, Lieutenant!

1049
00:51:10,826 --> 00:51:12,448
They know you've seen me.

1050
00:51:12,552 --> 00:51:14,726
Turn me in.

1051
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,762
You must.

1052
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:36,921
You're our only chance.

1053
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:40,787
So, you young swine!

1054
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:47,138
I've failed, but
others will carry on.

1055
00:51:47,242 --> 00:51:53,731
Keep her here.

1056
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,733
Captain, the guard is
certain that this Tartu

1057
00:51:55,836 --> 00:51:57,286
here saw the girl pick up--

1058
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:57,976
Please!

1059
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,289
The door, it is open.

1060
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:01,187
May we have it closed?

1061
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,327
Shut it.

1062
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,295
Thank you.

1063
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:07,710
Yes, it was Pavla Palecek.

1064
00:52:07,814 --> 00:52:09,229
She had that bag in her hand.

1065
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,437
More steel filings.

1066
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,921
To burn out more motors.

1067
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:12,819
Yes.

1068
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:15,097
Why didn't you
say so out there?

1069
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:18,065
But Lieutenant,
isn't it obvious?

1070
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:20,827
Captain, surely you understand.

1071
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,242
But it is so plain.

1072
00:52:22,346 --> 00:52:24,348
Already, I make friends
among the Czechs.

1073
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:25,866
They begin to trust me.

1074
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,041
The work that I was sent
here to do, it will go on.

1075
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,630
But if these Czechs were
ever to suspect that it was

1076
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:34,737
their new friend Captain Tartu
who gave this girl away--

1077
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:39,742
well, surely now, Captain, a man
of your intelligence must see.

1078
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:40,812
Yes, of course.

1079
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:41,986
Quite right.

1080
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:44,437
Good work, Captain.

1081
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,164
It won't be made
public, I hope?

1082
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:48,026
Of course not.

1083
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,339
What do you take me for?

1084
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:52,307
Start your machines again.

1085
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,205
Have the girl shot.

1086
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:57,691
Yes, sir.

1087
00:52:57,795 --> 00:52:59,728
Oh, Tartu.

1088
00:52:59,831 --> 00:53:01,039
Please.

1089
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:02,765
You seem very quick
witted for a Romanian.

1090
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:06,769
Oh, well, as I told him when I
first came here-- but not all,

1091
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:08,840
are as quick as you,
even in the Party.

1092
00:53:08,944 --> 00:53:10,256
I am not an ordinary
munitions worker.

1093
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:11,705
No, no.

1094
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:13,224
I am a graduate chemist.

1095
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:13,845
Is that so?

1096
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:16,123
Chemist, eh?

1097
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,090
Chemist.

1098
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,368
Well, I will see
what can be done.

1099
00:53:19,472 --> 00:53:20,887
That is all.

1100
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:57,303
Thank you, Sir.

1101
00:53:57,406 --> 00:53:58,304
[gun shot]

1102
00:53:58,407 --> 00:54:18,358
[alarm sounding]

1103
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:23,294
Good afternoon.

1104
00:54:23,398 --> 00:54:24,364
Good afternoon.

1105
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:25,227
How's the headache?

1106
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:26,055
Frightful.

1107
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:27,781
I didn't sleep a wink all night.

1108
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:29,956
So don't tell me I have to wait,
because I made an appointment

1109
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,095
early this morning.

1110
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:37,377
Dr. Novotny will see you now.

1111
00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:46,904
[doorbell buzzing]

1112
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:47,801
Good afternoon.

1113
00:54:47,905 --> 00:54:49,147
Good afternoon, Doctor.

1114
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:52,323
Come in.

1115
00:54:52,427 --> 00:54:56,293
Please, sit down.

1116
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:58,778
Well, Maruschka.

1117
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:02,471
I understand you spent yesterday
with the Commandant again.

1118
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:03,852
Anything to tell us?

1119
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:06,095
Nothing yet.

1120
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:08,063
Every time I brought up the
subject of the new air drum,

1121
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,064
he avoided it, very obviously.

1122
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:10,203
Then why call a meeting?

1123
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,687
I wanted to speak
to the council

1124
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:16,071
because I feel I have
something much more important.

1125
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:18,867
It concerns a man
named Tartu, Jan Tartu.

1126
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,490
Tartu?

1127
00:55:21,594 --> 00:55:23,872
Well then you know him?

1128
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:26,219
We know he's living
in the Palecek house.

1129
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,324
Yes.

1130
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:29,843
And he's a friend, Dr. Novotny.

1131
00:55:29,947 --> 00:55:31,914
Yesterday, when they
came to see Pavla,

1132
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:34,745
he hid the gun, saved her life.

1133
00:55:34,848 --> 00:55:36,747
He's on a very
important mission.

1134
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,093
He wants to contact
the underground.

1135
00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:39,715
You didn't tell him about us?

1136
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:40,613
No, naturally not.

1137
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:42,580
I only obey orders.

1138
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:47,344
But I want permission
to bring him here.

1139
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:52,832
What makes you so
sure of him, Maruschka?

1140
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:55,869
I told you-- he
saved Pavla's life.

1141
00:55:55,973 --> 00:56:00,736
Oh yes, he mentioned
Peter Valek.

1142
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,121
And then, well, I've seen
so much of the other kind,

1143
00:56:06,224 --> 00:56:08,882
I'm not entirely insensible
to honesty and sincerity

1144
00:56:08,986 --> 00:56:10,988
when I do meet it.

1145
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:15,717
Did you know Peter Valek
was executed yesterday?

1146
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,960
No!

1147
00:56:18,064 --> 00:56:20,963
When did you last
see Pavla Palecek?

1148
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:23,034
This morning.

1149
00:56:23,138 --> 00:56:25,865
This afternoon she was shot.

1150
00:56:25,968 --> 00:56:29,524
[WHISPERING] Not Pavla.

1151
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:31,457
Oh, no!

1152
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,219
Oh, no.

1153
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:46,195
[crying]

1154
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:50,303
Tell Maruschka how
Pavla was discovered.

1155
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,098
The foreman came into
the head officer.

1156
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:55,688
He said he wanted to
report her in private.

1157
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,206
Why?

1158
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,761
He said he was going the
confidence of certain Czechs,

1159
00:56:59,864 --> 00:57:02,004
that the work that he was
sent to do was going forward,

1160
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:04,869
and that it would
spoil his plans,

1161
00:57:04,973 --> 00:57:07,562
if it was known that
he had reported her.

1162
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:12,463
What was the foreman's
name Jan Tartu.

1163
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:13,291
That's all, Yenna.

1164
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:16,053
Thank you.

1165
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:22,128
I might just as well
have killed her myself.

1166
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:25,303
You were caught by the
oldest trick my dear,

1167
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:30,861
he pretend to save Pavla in
order to get to the rest of us.

1168
00:57:30,964 --> 00:57:32,034
I'll do anything
to see him dead.

1169
00:57:32,138 --> 00:57:35,348
Anything!

1170
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,006
It would be excellent to
have him out of the way.

1171
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:38,972
We must be careful.

1172
00:57:39,076 --> 00:57:41,354
They are taking hostages.

1173
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,840
From now on, any more killings
and 100 of our people--

1174
00:57:44,944 --> 00:57:48,223
200 even, would die in return.

1175
00:57:48,326 --> 00:57:52,089
If that is so, forgive
my putting it bluntly.

1176
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:53,642
Are we wise to trust
this case to someone

1177
00:57:53,746 --> 00:57:56,749
who has already allowed her
sex to influence her judgement?

1178
00:57:56,852 --> 00:58:00,304
I have known Maruschka
Lanova since she was born.

1179
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:03,031
The mistake she has
made over this man

1180
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:06,379
will make her more
careful from now on.

1181
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:13,179
Besides, you are on pretty
intimate terms with him.

1182
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,870
I can do anything
I like with him.

1183
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:15,802
Very useful, that.

1184
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:20,289
A virtue of necessity.

1185
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:51,873
You can trust me absolutely
to eliminate Captain Tartu.

1186
00:58:51,976 --> 00:58:53,219
I will kill him myself.

1187
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,842
It will be easy.

1188
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:57,844
He sleeps in the kitchen.

1189
00:58:57,948 --> 00:58:59,052
Tonight, I will take a knife!

1190
00:58:59,156 --> 00:59:00,433
No.

1191
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,229
Novotny's just told us--
for every Nazi killed,

1192
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:06,232
200 Czechs will die.

1193
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:08,027
I would give myself up.

1194
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,235
But it wouldn't do
any good, Darling.

1195
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:10,995
It's always [inaudible].

1196
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:16,000
Doesn't feel safe
unless it's 200 to 1.

1197
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:21,074
No, it must be done
some other way.

1198
00:59:21,178 --> 00:59:23,352
Novotny asked me how
I was going to do it.

1199
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:26,493
I said I didn't know.

1200
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,461
I didn't, then.

1201
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,981
I do now.

1202
00:59:31,084 --> 00:59:36,365
If he were to be done away
with by one of his own kind.

1203
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:38,851
One sneaking coward
destroys another,

1204
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:40,231
Anna-- and nobody the wiser.

1205
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:46,272
[door opens]

1206
00:59:46,375 --> 01:00:10,952
I'll be back.

1207
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:11,953
[knocking]

1208
01:00:12,056 --> 01:00:13,057
Yes?

1209
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:14,507
MARUSCHKA: Otto,
are you dressed?

1210
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,234
Maruschka!

1211
01:00:17,337 --> 01:00:20,202
Can we talk somewhere?

1212
01:00:20,306 --> 01:00:22,204
Oh yes, come in.

1213
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:24,690
Is this respectable, Otto?

1214
01:00:24,793 --> 01:00:26,036
I think I refused
to come in here

1215
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:29,591
last night-- for
some such reasons.

1216
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:33,595
A girl can change
her mind, huh?

1217
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:36,218
Your hat is pretty,
but you might

1218
01:00:36,322 --> 01:00:38,911
like-- to take it off, huh?

1219
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:44,917
Well, let me get my breath
and have a look around.

1220
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,884
This is very restful room, Otto.

1221
01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:54,133
Schnaps-- sent from home.

1222
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:57,515
I'll bet this doesn't
come from home.

1223
01:00:57,619 --> 01:00:59,069
That?

1224
01:00:59,172 --> 01:01:03,245
Oh, that came from the finest
art collection at Pilsen.

1225
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:05,351
Borrowed, for the duration.

1226
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:13,117
Yes-- of my life.

1227
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:18,605
Maruschka, to your
being here in my room.

1228
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:24,232
To the success
of my being here.

1229
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:25,854
Maruschka!

1230
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:31,170
I said to the success
of my being here, Otto.

1231
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:33,931
Otto, I need your help.

1232
01:01:34,035 --> 01:01:36,969
I need it badly.

1233
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:38,591
And I know you're
one I can trust.

1234
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,145
Always, Maruschka-- in any way.

1235
01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:43,872
You know I want to
get back with my family

1236
01:01:43,976 --> 01:01:45,253
own-- after the war.

1237
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:46,599
I know, Darling, but
that's something I can't--

1238
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,429
And I know you have a
Party career in mind.

1239
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:51,846
Obviously a man of your
ability doesn't expect

1240
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:53,951
to remain a mere inspector.

1241
01:01:54,055 --> 01:01:56,229
Oh, I've, I've plans
ahead that will put you--

1242
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,163
We might realize both
our ambitions, Otto,

1243
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:01,096
if you'll help me with
a certain individual

1244
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,133
by the name of Jan Tartu.

1245
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:04,272
Tartu?

1246
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,135
What's he?

1247
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:06,792
I think he's a spy.

1248
01:02:06,895 --> 01:02:07,827
OTTO: What?

1249
01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:11,348
I'm sure of it.

1250
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:14,972
As you know, I detest the
insolent fool, Maruschka,

1251
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:17,009
but you must be careful.

1252
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:19,287
He's of the Romanian Iron Guard.

1253
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:22,152
The party still
needs their help.

1254
01:02:22,255 --> 01:02:23,498
He came with credentials.

1255
01:02:23,601 --> 01:02:26,535
Iron Guard-- I doubt he
even comes from Romania.

1256
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:27,985
No?

1257
01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:30,263
What makes you think that?

1258
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:32,058
Well, I don't know.

1259
01:02:32,162 --> 01:02:34,578
There's an underground group
here of some sort working

1260
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:35,855
against the Reich, isn't there?

1261
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:36,511
Yes, yes.

1262
01:02:36,614 --> 01:02:38,099
Go on.

1263
01:02:38,202 --> 01:02:39,583
Well, last night
at the casino, he

1264
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:41,999
hinted he was trying to
contact them to get their help.

1265
01:02:42,103 --> 01:02:42,862
Help?

1266
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:44,208
For what?

1267
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:47,177
Otto, when a man wants the
help of an underground movement,

1268
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,524
it can't be for to
good of the Reich.

1269
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:50,663
Oh, yes.

1270
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,217
Now I didn't say anything
last night to you.

1271
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:56,738
That was why I was
so easy with him.

1272
01:02:56,842 --> 01:02:58,809
I wanted to see if he'd
mentioned it to me again

1273
01:02:58,913 --> 01:02:59,879
this morning.

1274
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:02,088
Well, did he?

1275
01:03:02,192 --> 01:03:03,434
Just as I was coming
out of my room.

1276
01:03:03,538 --> 01:03:07,024
He suggested that this
girl in the house, this

1277
01:03:07,128 --> 01:03:10,407
Pavla-- oh, yes.

1278
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,341
I understand she was shot today.

1279
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:14,721
Sabotage where she
works, or something.

1280
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,896
Yes, yes, but never
mind about her.

1281
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,036
All right.

1282
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,177
He practically said he
knew I was her friend,

1283
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,766
and that we could do something
for him with the underground,

1284
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,147
or whatever it is
they call themselves.

1285
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,356
Huh.

1286
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:30,772
Oh, this is serious.

1287
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:35,950
Well-- well, we can
easily prove about him.

1288
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,365
How?

1289
01:03:37,468 --> 01:03:38,331
Call the Gestapo and tell
them to check up on him.

1290
01:03:38,435 --> 01:03:39,229
No, no, Otto!

1291
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:40,609
Huh?

1292
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:44,130
Not when we can get all
the credit ourselves.

1293
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:47,927
Yes, but how?

1294
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:49,411
I don't mind, Darling,
it's so simple.

1295
01:03:49,515 --> 01:03:51,379
You can use this can't you?

1296
01:03:51,482 --> 01:03:53,864
Yes, but I've got to be sure.

1297
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:55,762
All it needs is
some little meeting.

1298
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:57,419
such as in the
garden last night,

1299
01:03:57,523 --> 01:04:00,837
only you're behind the
hedge, to hear for yourself.

1300
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,183
Hear what?

1301
01:04:02,286 --> 01:04:04,806
I scream, you shoot.

1302
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:09,984
You and I are both there to
testify, an enemy of the Reich

1303
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:12,883
lies there, disposed of.

1304
01:04:12,987 --> 01:04:14,022
I see.

1305
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:17,025
I get what I want
and maybe they'll make

1306
01:04:17,129 --> 01:04:20,063
you a general or something.

1307
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:23,273
Very clever, Maruschka.

1308
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:24,170
When can you meet him again?

1309
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:25,240
Tonight.

1310
01:04:25,344 --> 01:04:26,517
Where?

1311
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:27,415
At the cafe, where
we were last night.

1312
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:28,347
I'll be there.

1313
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,038
There may people around.

1314
01:04:30,142 --> 01:04:32,213
For the good-- more convincing.

1315
01:04:32,316 --> 01:04:33,317
You know the alcove
on the terrace?

1316
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:35,043
Yes.
Take him there.

1317
01:04:35,147 --> 01:04:36,320
I'll make arrangements.

1318
01:04:36,424 --> 01:04:39,289
I'll be able to hear
everything he says.

1319
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:43,327
Darling, you're a genius!

1320
01:04:43,431 --> 01:04:44,881
And Otto--

1321
01:04:44,984 --> 01:04:46,227
Eh?

1322
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,125
Do you know what
else might happen

1323
01:04:48,229 --> 01:04:50,852
for us, if we are successful?

1324
01:04:50,956 --> 01:04:52,267
What?

1325
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:56,823
Next time I come in this room,
I might even take off my hat.

1326
01:04:56,927 --> 01:05:13,254
[music playing]

1327
01:05:13,357 --> 01:05:16,947
The Romanian again, eh?

1328
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:20,813
I'm sorry to be late,
but it's been a hard day.

1329
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,092
Pavla-- I suppose you know.

1330
01:05:24,196 --> 01:05:25,852
Yes.

1331
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:26,819
Were you there?

1332
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,959
Yes.

1333
01:05:29,063 --> 01:05:32,342
She looked at me when
they led her away.

1334
01:05:32,445 --> 01:05:36,208
I'll never forget
that look-- never.

1335
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:38,210
I know.

1336
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:41,109
I know how close she was to you.

1337
01:05:41,213 --> 01:05:42,593
What is your real name?

1338
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:43,422
I can't tell you now.

1339
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:45,734
Later, I will.

1340
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:48,185
I have other things to
tell you, things that can't

1341
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,187
be told until my job's done.

1342
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:51,982
Have you any news for me?

1343
01:05:52,086 --> 01:05:55,744
You see, well, I didn't
tell you last night,

1344
01:05:55,848 --> 01:05:58,747
but I'm not a member of this
underground group myself.

1345
01:05:58,851 --> 01:06:00,335
To be frank, I don't think
they're ready to trust me yet.

1346
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:01,992
What?

1347
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:05,340
But I was sure Pavla was, and I
thought through Pavla I could--

1348
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:08,343
but now.

1349
01:06:08,447 --> 01:06:10,863
Do you know anyone else?

1350
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,416
Well, I have to
be very careful.

1351
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,420
Oh, I realize that.

1352
01:06:16,524 --> 01:06:19,078
But it's more important
than ever now.

1353
01:06:19,182 --> 01:06:20,666
Things are coming to a head.

1354
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,806
I'm being transferred to the
new gas laboratories tomorrow.

1355
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:27,155
I'm sorry, Darling, but
I'll work as fast as I can.

1356
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:28,156
You know that, don't you.

1357
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,399
Of course, of course.

1358
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:32,126
So just let's enjoy
being together.

1359
01:06:32,229 --> 01:06:33,161
Yes.

1360
01:06:33,265 --> 01:06:36,371
Where would you like to sit?

1361
01:06:36,475 --> 01:06:37,890
Over there.

1362
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:57,944
Shall we?

1363
01:06:58,048 --> 01:07:01,258
Just to prove I've found time
to think of you as something

1364
01:07:01,362 --> 01:07:06,022
more than an accomplice.

1365
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,747
It just looked as
if it was waiting--

1366
01:07:07,851 --> 01:07:13,891
waiting to be bought for you.

1367
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:15,134
It's lovely.

1368
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:18,137
[humming]

1369
01:07:18,241 --> 01:07:19,138
Ah, that's better.

1370
01:07:19,242 --> 01:07:20,657
That's much better.

1371
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,107
I've always liked that tune.

1372
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:25,110
[singing in german]

1373
01:07:25,213 --> 01:07:26,111
You know the words?

1374
01:07:26,214 --> 01:07:27,112
Mm-mm.

1375
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:28,251
They're German.

1376
01:07:28,354 --> 01:07:29,286
Yes, written years ago.

1377
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:32,220
That sort of music is universal.

1378
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:33,808
Strange.

1379
01:07:33,911 --> 01:07:35,396
They tell me that's one of
the Fuhrer's favorite waltzes.

1380
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:37,018
Oh. tsk-tsk.

1381
01:07:37,122 --> 01:07:44,957
Well, if that music could
speak, I'm sure it would object.

1382
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,236
In your country, do they hate
Hitler as much as we do here?

1383
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,100
Well, I don't know that we
spend a lot of time hating.

1384
01:07:50,204 --> 01:07:51,343
After all, most of
us are working 24

1385
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:58,177
hours a day to get rid of him.

1386
01:07:58,281 --> 01:08:00,214
I like to hear you say that.

1387
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:03,044
Tell me more of what you're
doing to get rid of him.

1388
01:08:03,148 --> 01:08:04,701
I want to hear.

1389
01:08:04,804 --> 01:08:05,702
I want to hear from you.

1390
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:12,295
[soldiers marching]

1391
01:08:12,398 --> 01:08:15,125
All officers-- report to me!

1392
01:08:15,229 --> 01:08:19,129
Trouble, I'm afraid.

1393
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:23,892
Don't worry.

1394
01:08:23,996 --> 01:08:28,069
Attention,
attention, all Czechs!

1395
01:08:28,173 --> 01:08:29,829
By order of the
Commandant of this area,

1396
01:08:29,933 --> 01:08:32,729
owing to the illegal
and treacherous behavior

1397
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:34,489
among certain and
corrupt Czech elements

1398
01:08:34,593 --> 01:08:37,285
of the local population.

1399
01:08:37,389 --> 01:08:39,080
All Czechs will be
examined for their passes,

1400
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:44,223
travel papers, and concealed
weapons, under royal command.

1401
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:47,295
All Czechs will collect in
the center of the floor.

1402
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:48,331
Attention!

1403
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:52,300
Czechs, march!

1404
01:08:52,404 --> 01:08:54,302
Stop!

1405
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:55,303
[gunshot]

1406
01:08:55,407 --> 01:09:01,067
[woman screams]

1407
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:11,768
Take him away.

1408
01:09:11,871 --> 01:09:18,706
[singing in german]

1409
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:19,707
Heil, Hitler!

1410
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:41,418
ALL: Heil, Hitler!

1411
01:09:41,522 --> 01:09:54,983
[knocking]

1412
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:56,916
Hello?

1413
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,677
I got mixed up with
a lot of Nazis.

1414
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,092
Had to do my stuff.

1415
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:04,855
I understand.

1416
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,305
See you tomorrow?

1417
01:10:06,409 --> 01:10:08,859
Of course.

1418
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:13,070
I'll be at the works all day.

1419
01:10:13,174 --> 01:10:14,071
MARUSCHKA: Jan?

1420
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:15,901
Mm?

1421
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:20,319
Let's have dinner at the
same place, same time.

1422
01:10:20,423 --> 01:10:21,838
Wonderful.

1423
01:10:21,941 --> 01:10:25,290
I'm looking forward.

1424
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:28,293
So am I.

1425
01:10:28,396 --> 01:10:37,163
Good night, Darling.

1426
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:49,245
Good night.

1427
01:10:49,348 --> 01:10:50,763
Here you are, Captain.

1428
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:52,800
Where is the gas plant?

1429
01:10:52,903 --> 01:10:54,836
It's buried inside the hill.

1430
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:07,297
Walk through the farm
halls and you'll find it.

1431
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:08,505
Here.

1432
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:13,303
Jan Tartu, reporting for work.

1433
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,030
Very well, Tartu.

1434
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:18,860
You put your personal effects
and valuables in here.

1435
01:11:18,964 --> 01:11:20,103
You can't take
anything in there.

1436
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:20,862
Of course.

1437
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:22,174
Your number is 82.

1438
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:28,456
Thank you.

1439
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,182
Is that everything?

1440
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,494
Everything.

1441
01:11:31,597 --> 01:11:32,909
Tie pin.

1442
01:11:33,012 --> 01:11:34,842
Oh, yes. of course.

1443
01:11:34,945 --> 01:11:36,188
Take him to Dr. Willendorf.

1444
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,466
First level.

1445
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,365
Dr. Willendorf is expecting you.

1446
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:41,366
It is an honor.

1447
01:11:41,469 --> 01:11:44,334
This way, please.

1448
01:11:44,438 --> 01:11:47,855
[alarm]

1449
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:49,235
What is wrong?

1450
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:50,754
-You have forgotten something?
-Hmm?

1451
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:51,548
Forgotten?

1452
01:11:51,652 --> 01:11:52,756
Electric ray.

1453
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,102
It says you have
some steel on you.

1454
01:11:54,206 --> 01:11:54,965
Missing?

1455
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:57,485
Me?

1456
01:11:57,589 --> 01:12:02,041
Ah, the key.

1457
01:12:02,145 --> 01:12:03,526
I hate to part with it.

1458
01:12:03,629 --> 01:12:05,010
I only met her yesterday.

1459
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:06,701
Oh, so it is one
of those things?

1460
01:12:06,805 --> 01:12:07,495
Lovely thing.

1461
01:12:07,599 --> 01:12:10,740
Lovely thing.

1462
01:12:10,843 --> 01:12:11,913
Most hospitable.

1463
01:12:12,017 --> 01:12:13,329
She lives with her
younger sister.

1464
01:12:13,432 --> 01:12:14,744
Sister-- pretty?

1465
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,332
Oh-- from top to toe.

1466
01:12:16,435 --> 01:12:18,161
Is she attached?

1467
01:12:18,264 --> 01:12:23,304
Yes, but he's going to
Prague in a couple of days.

1468
01:12:23,408 --> 01:12:26,997
All right, I'll
see you later, huh?

1469
01:12:27,101 --> 01:12:28,896
Guard it with your life.

1470
01:12:28,999 --> 01:12:35,040
This way, please.

1471
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:38,215
If there is an air raid
alarm, follow the signs.

1472
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:48,329
Wait here, I'll
find Dr. Willendorf.

1473
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:56,510
Dr. Willendorf?

1474
01:12:56,613 --> 01:12:58,753
Captain Tartu, Dr. Willendorf.

1475
01:12:58,857 --> 01:12:59,961
Heil, Hitler!

1476
01:13:00,065 --> 01:13:06,382
Come with me.

1477
01:13:06,485 --> 01:13:08,798
Who is this?

1478
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:09,868
My new chemist, Tartu.

1479
01:13:09,971 --> 01:13:16,288
Captain Von Felisch.

1480
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,047
Well?

1481
01:13:17,151 --> 01:13:18,014
What are you waiting for?

1482
01:13:18,117 --> 01:13:19,429
Only to serve the Fuhrer.

1483
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:24,848
Heil, Hitler!

1484
01:13:24,952 --> 01:13:26,298
DR WILLENDORF: Tartu.

1485
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,989
Gas retorts?

1486
01:13:28,093 --> 01:13:36,273
All of them, to my
own specifications.

1487
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:39,035
I trust you know your
business, my friend.

1488
01:13:39,138 --> 01:13:41,520
We are running an
emergency schedule here.

1489
01:13:41,624 --> 01:13:43,004
I'm quite confident, Sir.

1490
01:13:43,108 --> 01:13:45,559
You have worked with the
metal in concert, right?

1491
01:13:45,662 --> 01:13:47,077
Oh, yes.

1492
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:49,390
For two or for three years,
under Professor Bern,

1493
01:13:49,494 --> 01:13:50,529
at Munich.

1494
01:13:50,633 --> 01:13:55,223
Good.

1495
01:13:55,327 --> 01:14:00,781
This way.

1496
01:14:00,884 --> 01:14:04,819
You will find we are making
an amazing gas here, Tartu.

1497
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:09,168
Start by learning the
formula thoroughly.

1498
01:14:09,272 --> 01:14:12,344
I didn't see any bomb casings
out there, Dr. Willendorf.

1499
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,518
Are they filled
on another level?

1500
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:14,829
No.

1501
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:16,279
We ship the gas to
the various fronts

1502
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:20,248
in two separate liquid forms.

1503
01:14:20,352 --> 01:14:22,803
There, the liquids
are compounded,

1504
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:25,219
and the [inaudible]
cases charged,

1505
01:14:25,322 --> 01:14:28,187
just prior to operations.

1506
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:38,301
But get that stuck in your
head as quickly as possible.

1507
01:14:38,404 --> 01:15:01,842
[music playing]

1508
01:15:01,945 --> 01:15:12,197
[alarm ringing]

1509
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,752
I am very pleased
with you, Tartu.

1510
01:15:15,856 --> 01:15:17,927
Thank you, Sir.

1511
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,273
Your new gas is
more than amazing.

1512
01:15:19,376 --> 01:15:23,173
It is almost inconceivable
in its deadliness.

1513
01:15:23,277 --> 01:15:26,660
And it will be put to good use.

1514
01:15:26,763 --> 01:15:29,179
I would like you to come one
hour earlier in the morning,

1515
01:15:29,283 --> 01:15:29,904
please.

1516
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:31,354
Certainly.

1517
01:15:31,457 --> 01:15:32,873
All day tomorrow we shall
be running final tests

1518
01:15:32,976 --> 01:15:35,013
and I shall need
your assistance.

1519
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:36,462
Final tests?

1520
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:39,811
You're not ready with your
first shipment, are you?

1521
01:15:39,914 --> 01:15:41,364
Two weeks ahead of time.

1522
01:15:41,467 --> 01:15:45,955
Tomorrow night, they will be
loading it onto the trucks.

1523
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:47,888
And soon, on some
beautifully clouded evening,

1524
01:15:47,991 --> 01:15:50,097
it will be unloaded--
on England.

1525
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:50,925
Heil, Hitler.

1526
01:15:51,029 --> 01:16:21,473
Heil, Hitler.

1527
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,026
Maruschka?

1528
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:24,338
Where is Maruschka?

1529
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:25,304
Out.

1530
01:16:25,408 --> 01:16:27,030
The Commandant
called unexpectedly

1531
01:16:27,134 --> 01:16:28,480
to take her to dinner.

1532
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,171
She told me to tell you
that only that could keep

1533
01:16:30,275 --> 01:16:31,552
her from seeing you tonight.
-Where did they go?

1534
01:16:31,656 --> 01:16:33,002
Do you know?
-No.

1535
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:33,761
Is there no way at all
that I can contact her?

1536
01:16:33,865 --> 01:16:35,004
No.

1537
01:16:35,107 --> 01:16:35,591
Can't you get a
message through to her?

1538
01:16:35,694 --> 01:16:36,730
No.

1539
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:38,904
Look here, I've got to
do something tonight.

1540
01:16:39,008 --> 01:16:40,492
Take any chance.

1541
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,011
Can't you help?

1542
01:16:42,114 --> 01:17:02,825
I can get you some supper.

1543
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:06,967
Waiter, waiter!

1544
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:08,037
Eh?
-Another brandy, Sir?

1545
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,107
Brandy, rum?

1546
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:11,109
How much have I been swindled?

1547
01:17:11,212 --> 01:17:13,594
I'm trying to get out
of this slop cave.

1548
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:14,595
Here, Sir.

1549
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:15,492
Who asked for that?

1550
01:17:15,596 --> 01:17:16,839
Give it to me.

1551
01:17:16,942 --> 01:17:18,392
Get out of the way.

1552
01:17:18,495 --> 01:17:21,222
Give me another brandy, quick!

1553
01:17:21,326 --> 01:17:26,020
Oh, you seem a pleasant
enough sort of fellow, hmm?

1554
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:28,091
How about letting
me buy you a drink?

1555
01:17:28,195 --> 01:17:30,438
No, thank you.

1556
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:31,370
Why not?

1557
01:17:31,474 --> 01:17:34,028
This is my limit
for this evening.

1558
01:17:34,132 --> 01:17:37,791
Thank you all the same.

1559
01:17:37,894 --> 01:17:39,068
Brandy, Sir.

1560
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:41,208
Eh, you Czechs.

1561
01:17:41,311 --> 01:17:43,969
Think yourselves pretty
smart, don't you?

1562
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:45,350
Won't fraternize.

1563
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:46,938
Waiting for the hour
when you're going to rise

1564
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:49,975
up and throw us out, eh?

1565
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:51,045
Well, who's going to lead you?

1566
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:52,840
Tell me that.

1567
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:54,324
Blah.

1568
01:17:54,428 --> 01:17:56,602
Some of those amateur heroes
of yours that you've got

1569
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:59,398
hidden away in that
underground army?

1570
01:17:59,502 --> 01:18:01,228
Hmm?

1571
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:03,368
All right, don't talk.

1572
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,922
But they are not going to
lead you, I can tell you that.

1573
01:18:06,026 --> 01:18:07,441
Why?

1574
01:18:07,544 --> 01:18:09,995
Because they won't be able
to rise out to the graves!

1575
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:11,514
That's why!

1576
01:18:11,617 --> 01:18:14,137
I know six of the rats who
are going to be smoked out

1577
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:16,174
by the end of the week-- six!

1578
01:18:16,277 --> 01:18:19,384
The Gestapo's have got
their names and everything?

1579
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:21,386
Do you know why I know?

1580
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:32,017
Because I happen to be-- Well,
maybe I'm talking too much.

1581
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:34,192
Hey, you-- another
brandy, quick.

1582
01:18:34,295 --> 01:18:49,621
Coming, Sir.

1583
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,106
There's plenty of
things I can tell you.

1584
01:18:52,210 --> 01:20:01,313
Plenty of things.

1585
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:04,627
One of you must be
pretty good at ice hockey,

1586
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:18,365
But if you're the people I
think you are, it was worth it.

1587
01:20:18,468 --> 01:20:20,988
Tonight you said you know
so of the names of Czechs

1588
01:20:21,092 --> 01:20:22,127
on the Gestapo's list.

1589
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:23,197
Yes.

1590
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:25,165
We want to know who they are.

1591
01:20:25,268 --> 01:20:26,649
Believe me, I don't know them.

1592
01:20:26,752 --> 01:20:28,340
I only talked like that
in the last hope of making

1593
01:20:28,444 --> 01:20:30,964
contact with the underground.

1594
01:20:31,067 --> 01:20:33,345
And I think I have, haven't I?

1595
01:20:33,449 --> 01:20:43,217
Supposing you have?

1596
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:46,082
I'm a British secret
agent gentleman,

1597
01:20:46,186 --> 01:20:48,878
I need your help desperately.

1598
01:20:48,982 --> 01:20:51,916
We need more proof than
merely your word for it.

1599
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,503
But that's all I can give.

1600
01:20:53,607 --> 01:20:55,920
No-- Peter Valek-- he was about
to put me in touch with you

1601
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:57,231
when they caught him.

1602
01:20:57,335 --> 01:20:59,302
My job is a very big one.

1603
01:20:59,406 --> 01:21:01,408
I'm here to wreck
their new gas plant.

1604
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:02,719
I'm working there now.

1605
01:21:02,823 --> 01:21:04,894
But I must have
help-- chemicals,

1606
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:07,345
a place to make pocket bombs,
men to help make them--

1607
01:21:07,448 --> 01:21:09,278
tonight-- now.

1608
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:15,284
They're shipping the first
batch of gas tomorrow.

1609
01:21:15,387 --> 01:21:16,526
You must believe me.

1610
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:17,942
Do you think I'd be
mad enough to take

1611
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:19,219
this chance if the situation
wasn't of the greatest--

1612
01:21:19,322 --> 01:21:21,221
One moment.

1613
01:21:21,324 --> 01:21:23,568
You informed on
the Palecek girl.

1614
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,190
Why?

1615
01:21:25,294 --> 01:21:26,812
I had to.

1616
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:31,438
They knew I'd seen her do it,
and she knew they'd seen me.

1617
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:34,993
If you have a erect a
monument to Czech patriotism,

1618
01:21:35,097 --> 01:21:37,409
that girl's name should be
carved in letters as high as--

1619
01:21:37,513 --> 01:21:39,895
Grant you that.

1620
01:21:39,998 --> 01:21:41,275
What is your real name?

1621
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:43,795
Kept Terrance Stevenson,
Royal Engineers,

1622
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:48,006
now detached to a special work
with military intelligence.

1623
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:57,774
Break this, swine!

1624
01:21:57,878 --> 01:22:03,642
Now that's there--
the Gestapo, I take it.

1625
01:22:03,746 --> 01:22:07,439
Correct.

1626
01:22:07,543 --> 01:22:10,132
It's not a nice sensation
for a man to realize he's

1627
01:22:10,235 --> 01:22:12,928
bungled his job, I assure you.

1628
01:22:13,031 --> 01:22:17,656
Your little display at the
bar was slightly obvious.

1629
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,971
Evidently.

1630
01:22:22,075 --> 01:22:27,252
Well, what now?

1631
01:22:27,356 --> 01:22:29,116
We do these things quickly.

1632
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,704
No formalities.

1633
01:22:30,807 --> 01:22:35,053
Just one shot at the
base of the neck.

1634
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:36,089
Well?

1635
01:22:36,192 --> 01:22:37,676
Shall we carry on?

1636
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,748
They want to get things ready.

1637
01:22:40,852 --> 01:22:45,167
If you care to write a message
to your family or anything

1638
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,445
over there.

1639
01:22:47,548 --> 01:22:56,764
That's very kind of you.

1640
01:22:56,868 --> 01:22:59,319
We are also the
decoding office.

1641
01:22:59,422 --> 01:23:04,117
So don't try any tricks.

1642
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:08,017
Having a difficult time, eh?

1643
01:23:08,121 --> 01:23:09,915
It isn't easy.

1644
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:12,297
The first time I've written
this kind of letter.

1645
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:22,928
Once is enough.

1646
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:23,377
Just a moment.

1647
01:23:23,481 --> 01:23:26,518
Read it.

1648
01:23:26,622 --> 01:23:31,316
"Dear Perry, I'm sorry
I have messed things up.

1649
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:34,009
Please let my mother know.

1650
01:23:34,112 --> 01:23:37,115
I'm sure you will be tactful.

1651
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:40,187
Give her my dear love.

1652
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:44,295
To you and all
friends, all the best.

1653
01:23:44,398 --> 01:23:51,992
Story to miss the victory binge.

1654
01:23:52,096 --> 01:23:54,960
Yours, Terrance Stevenson."

1655
01:23:55,064 --> 01:24:00,932
Let's see it.

1656
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:06,041
I suppose you realize
this is all quite futile.

1657
01:24:06,144 --> 01:24:08,664
You can do your work with
me, but you'd have to do

1658
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:10,907
it with the next and the next.

1659
01:24:11,011 --> 01:24:14,739
And no matter how long it
takes, the whole civilized world

1660
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:16,327
will keep on coming at you.

1661
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:19,226
Coming at you and coming again.

1662
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:21,194
You know that?

1663
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:22,057
Why--

1664
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,886
Wait, Nestor.

1665
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:26,440
You made a valiant effort
to contact the underground.

1666
01:24:26,544 --> 01:24:28,063
Congratulations.

1667
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:29,685
You have.

1668
01:24:29,788 --> 01:24:33,861
Captain Stevenson,
at your service, Sir.

1669
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:34,862
By Jove.

1670
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:37,313
I'm Dr. Novotny,
I have the honor

1671
01:24:37,417 --> 01:24:39,902
to be Chairman of our council

1672
01:24:40,005 --> 01:24:41,731
By Jove.

1673
01:24:41,835 --> 01:24:42,974
That's the second
time I've said that.

1674
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,389
[laughter]

1675
01:24:44,493 --> 01:24:46,391
I am sorry we had
to be so strenuous,

1676
01:24:46,495 --> 01:24:48,669
but you can
understand, I'm sure.

1677
01:24:48,773 --> 01:24:49,981
Yeah.

1678
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,812
It certainly was a
convincing performance.

1679
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:56,470
Look here, have you got
anything besides beer here?

1680
01:24:56,574 --> 01:24:58,852
Peter, some wine for all of us.

1681
01:24:58,955 --> 01:25:00,267
Oh, Doctor, we
mustn't waist a second.

1682
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:02,097
A gigantic undertaking.

1683
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,512
Yes, that.

1684
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:04,996
I shall need all the help
we can get in at once--

1685
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,411
a place to work, watch
mechanism for timing devices--

1686
01:25:06,515 --> 01:25:07,792
Yes, I know.

1687
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:11,761
Get Yoban, either at
my office or his house.

1688
01:25:11,865 --> 01:25:15,903
All of the help we can
give you, you shall have.

1689
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:20,080
We have our own laboratory here
on the cellar, crude as it is.

1690
01:25:20,184 --> 01:25:21,012
Splendid.

1691
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:31,436
We'll manage.

1692
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,851
Beautiful work.

1693
01:25:32,955 --> 01:25:34,405
I don't know what I'd have
done without your help.

1694
01:25:34,508 --> 01:25:37,718
The most compact container of
lethal power I've ever seen.

1695
01:25:37,822 --> 01:25:39,099
Well, we learned something, eh?

1696
01:25:39,203 --> 01:25:39,996
Yeah.

1697
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,481
Is there enough
explosive in there

1698
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:43,068
to blow up the entire plant?
-Yeah.

1699
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:44,829
Properly placed, there's
enough nitrogen in these

1700
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:47,245
to wipe out two entire blocks.

1701
01:25:47,349 --> 01:25:49,385
The only thing I can
understand is why they sent him.

1702
01:25:49,489 --> 01:25:51,974
[laughter]

1703
01:25:52,077 --> 01:25:54,045
Didn't you say you had to
report an hour earlier today?

1704
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:54,839
Yes.

1705
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:56,116
It is nearly seven o'clock.

1706
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:57,324
Thank you.

1707
01:25:57,428 --> 01:25:58,705
Our time table
worked out perfectly.

1708
01:25:58,808 --> 01:26:00,776
These are set to go
off at exactly 12:15.

1709
01:26:00,879 --> 01:26:02,398
That gives me just 15
minutes after noon lay off

1710
01:26:02,502 --> 01:26:04,020
to drop them in and clear out.

1711
01:26:04,124 --> 01:26:07,369
And Nestor here will be in
the car by the south field.

1712
01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:08,784
From 12:00 on.

1713
01:26:08,887 --> 01:26:10,165
And I'll have the door open.
-Good.

1714
01:26:10,268 --> 01:26:12,028
If you don't, you'll have
to expect the passenger

1715
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:13,133
through the window.

1716
01:26:13,237 --> 01:26:17,310
[laughter]

1717
01:26:17,413 --> 01:26:18,759
Good morning, Lieutenant.

1718
01:26:18,863 --> 01:26:20,105
I shall have to hurry.

1719
01:26:20,209 --> 01:26:22,384
I'm late.

1720
01:26:22,487 --> 01:26:29,770
Well, Tartu, I've been waiting.

1721
01:26:29,874 --> 01:26:32,152
Have you any news for me?

1722
01:26:32,256 --> 01:26:33,291
Oh, plenty.

1723
01:26:33,395 --> 01:26:37,295
See you in the lunch hour.

1724
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:57,522
[alarm]

1725
01:26:57,626 --> 01:26:59,904
Same old sabotage.

1726
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:03,079
Tonight, we use this together.

1727
01:27:03,183 --> 01:27:13,193
Aha!

1728
01:27:13,297 --> 01:27:15,333
Ah, Maruschka.

1729
01:27:15,437 --> 01:27:17,266
Maruschka, good, come.

1730
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:20,338
Come in here.

1731
01:27:20,442 --> 01:27:21,443
So serious, Otto?

1732
01:27:21,546 --> 01:27:22,927
Serious?

1733
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:27,034
Wait till I put through
a call and we'll see.

1734
01:27:27,138 --> 01:27:28,519
Hello?

1735
01:27:28,622 --> 01:27:31,073
Inspector Vogel
speaking, Division A2.

1736
01:27:31,176 --> 01:27:34,145
Get me Colonel Von Werder,
German Ligation, Bucharest.

1737
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,560
Yes, that's it.

1738
01:27:35,664 --> 01:27:37,907
What is this little
drama all about?

1739
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:40,116
When I got report
of this morning,

1740
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:42,326
I heard that Tartu is now
working at the new gas factory.

1741
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:43,603
Yes, he did mention it.

1742
01:27:43,706 --> 01:27:44,535
You knew he didn't
come home last night?

1743
01:27:44,638 --> 01:27:45,536
No, I didn't.

1744
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:47,296
Oh, this is all too dangerous.

1745
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,884
We can't wait now.

1746
01:27:48,987 --> 01:27:50,748
If anything happened
and it was found

1747
01:27:50,851 --> 01:27:51,887
out that you and
I were suspicious

1748
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:53,785
and hadn't reported him, why--

1749
01:27:53,889 --> 01:27:55,200
Well, why the
call to Bucharest?

1750
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:57,927
I inquired about his
credentials at Headquarters.

1751
01:27:58,031 --> 01:28:00,275
He came with a letter
from the Consul at Teget,

1752
01:28:00,378 --> 01:28:01,759
and was supposed to
have been sent to him

1753
01:28:01,862 --> 01:28:03,968
by Von Werder in Bucharest.

1754
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:05,935
I'm going to tat source now.

1755
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:07,143
Do you really think you need?

1756
01:28:07,247 --> 01:28:08,110
[telephone ringing]

1757
01:28:08,213 --> 01:28:11,216
Yes, Maruschka Hello?

1758
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,287
Yes?

1759
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:14,772
I'm waiting.

1760
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:21,779
[QUIETLY] You mean,
he isn't Gestapo?

1761
01:28:21,882 --> 01:28:25,127
So there's a chance
I've made a mistake.

1762
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:26,991
Still waiting.

1763
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:30,374
An Inspector Vogel, in Pilsen.

1764
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:33,204
Von Werder speaking.

1765
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,205
Tartu?

1766
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,827
That's impossible.

1767
01:28:35,931 --> 01:28:38,278
Tartu has been dead
over six months.

1768
01:28:38,382 --> 01:28:40,832
Ah, then he is a spy.

1769
01:28:40,936 --> 01:28:42,869
I thought his
papers were forged.

1770
01:28:42,972 --> 01:28:45,216
That's why I checked
with you, Colonel.

1771
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,493
Yes.

1772
01:28:46,597 --> 01:28:48,875
He'll be dealt with at once.

1773
01:28:48,978 --> 01:28:50,911
Thank you, Colonel.

1774
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:51,498
Yes.

1775
01:28:51,602 --> 01:28:53,224
Heil, Hitler.

1776
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,052
Ha ha.

1777
01:28:54,156 --> 01:28:57,159
You made no mistake, my Darling.

1778
01:28:57,262 --> 01:28:59,230
You don't seem very
pleased about it.

1779
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,369
Of course I'm pleased.

1780
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:02,647
I don't know what all
the excitement about.

1781
01:29:02,751 --> 01:29:06,030
I told you he was a spy, and now
you find it out for yourself.

1782
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:07,169
Yes.

1783
01:29:07,272 --> 01:29:10,034
But now he's working
at the gas factory.

1784
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:12,277
I must have him
arrested, at once.

1785
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:14,487
Hello.

1786
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:15,833
While, if the Gestapo--

1787
01:29:15,936 --> 01:29:17,455
You talked about this
doing us a bit of good?

1788
01:29:17,559 --> 01:29:18,905
It will.

1789
01:29:19,008 --> 01:29:22,529
I don't believe in
waiting, not for a moment.

1790
01:29:22,633 --> 01:29:23,427
Hello?

1791
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:25,567
Otto?

1792
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:32,436
Don't you remember what I
said when I was in here last?

1793
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:39,166
Maruschka!

1794
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,513
You men.

1795
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:41,893
You're all alike.

1796
01:29:41,997 --> 01:29:44,862
First it's me, and
then it's your future.

1797
01:29:44,965 --> 01:29:46,967
Same thing, Maruschka.

1798
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:49,763
You are in my future.

1799
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:50,799
This won't take long.

1800
01:29:50,902 --> 01:29:52,559
Don't be too sure.

1801
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:54,492
I'm not used to be
treating like this.

1802
01:29:54,596 --> 01:29:57,771
Your telephone call can wait.

1803
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,980
You might lose both
me and your future,

1804
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:02,397
if you're not very careful.

1805
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,157
Oh, I won't lost either.

1806
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:09,127
I've never felt so strong or
full of confidence before.

1807
01:30:09,231 --> 01:30:10,232
Hello?

1808
01:30:10,335 --> 01:30:13,787
OTTO: Don't you worry
about me, Darling.

1809
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:16,411
Inspector Vogel speaking,
I want the gas factory.

1810
01:30:16,514 --> 01:30:18,378
Emergency.

1811
01:30:18,482 --> 01:30:32,392
First time in my--

1812
01:30:32,496 --> 01:30:35,844
Anna!

1813
01:30:35,947 --> 01:30:44,024
Anna, quickly!

1814
01:30:44,128 --> 01:30:45,819
Anna, we were wrong about Jan.

1815
01:30:45,923 --> 01:30:48,581
How did it happen?

1816
01:30:48,684 --> 01:30:49,789
I can't tell you now.

1817
01:30:49,892 --> 01:30:51,549
We've got to save him.

1818
01:30:51,653 --> 01:30:53,413
There's no need
to tie his hands.

1819
01:30:53,517 --> 01:30:54,241
He is dead.

1820
01:30:54,345 --> 01:30:55,415
[telephone ringing]

1821
01:30:55,519 --> 01:30:57,866
Oh, I didn't mean to.

1822
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,247
I wish I had been
able to kill him.

1823
01:31:00,351 --> 01:31:03,803
Think Maruschka-- Pavla,
Karl, your father.

1824
01:31:03,906 --> 01:31:05,874
He can only die once.

1825
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:07,945
That is a pity.

1826
01:31:08,048 --> 01:31:10,050
We shan't be safe here now.

1827
01:31:10,154 --> 01:31:11,811
Go to Dr. Novotny and
tell him I'll report

1828
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:12,674
to him as soon as possible.

1829
01:31:12,777 --> 01:31:16,160
[telephone ringing]

1830
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:19,025
That's funny.

1831
01:31:19,128 --> 01:31:20,923
An inspector was
calling the gas plant,

1832
01:31:21,027 --> 01:31:21,924
and just when he
said, "emergency,"

1833
01:31:22,028 --> 01:31:24,271
he stopped and hung up.

1834
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,997
Did you get the
number he called from?

1835
01:31:26,101 --> 01:31:28,552
Yes, but when I called
back, there was no answer.

1836
01:31:28,655 --> 01:31:31,106
You'd better report it.

1837
01:31:31,209 --> 01:31:32,901
Yes.

1838
01:31:33,004 --> 01:31:34,454
Have you got a permit?

1839
01:31:34,558 --> 01:31:35,800
No, but it's very urgent.

1840
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:36,905
Have you got a permit?

1841
01:31:37,008 --> 01:31:38,562
No, but I simply must get in.

1842
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:41,496
All right, let her in.

1843
01:31:41,599 --> 01:31:42,876
Well, Fraulein.

1844
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,188
Hello, Lieutenant.

1845
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:45,430
Could I possibly speak
to a friend of mine?

1846
01:31:45,534 --> 01:31:48,364
He says he works here,
if he isn't lying.

1847
01:31:48,468 --> 01:31:50,435
Well, if you give me his name,
I'll see whether he is or not.

1848
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:51,782
Jan Tartu.

1849
01:31:51,885 --> 01:31:53,231
Tartu?

1850
01:31:53,335 --> 01:31:54,819
Just think of the best
looking man in the place--

1851
01:31:54,923 --> 01:31:56,441
not counting yourself--

1852
01:31:56,545 --> 01:31:57,995
Huh, Tartu.

1853
01:31:58,098 --> 01:32:00,135
He certainly wasn't lying
about you, Fraulein.

1854
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:03,828
Was he telling the
truth about your sister?

1855
01:32:03,932 --> 01:32:05,520
Didn't he mention me?

1856
01:32:05,623 --> 01:32:07,314
Lieutenant Krantz.

1857
01:32:07,418 --> 01:32:08,592
Oh, yes.

1858
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:10,421
So you're Lieutenant Krantz.

1859
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,043
Of course.

1860
01:32:12,147 --> 01:32:15,115
Lieutenant, couldn't
I speak to Jan?

1861
01:32:15,219 --> 01:32:16,531
Please?

1862
01:32:16,634 --> 01:32:18,256
Well, is an infraction of the
rules during working hours,

1863
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,119
but--

1864
01:32:19,223 --> 01:32:20,327
Oh, but you can manage it, yes?

1865
01:32:20,431 --> 01:32:21,846
For me?

1866
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:24,124
All right.

1867
01:32:24,228 --> 01:32:36,723
But shall we say,
for your sister, huh?

1868
01:32:36,827 --> 01:32:37,759
Where?

1869
01:32:37,862 --> 01:32:38,967
Through the fence there.

1870
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:40,244
And don't be too long.

1871
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:41,072
Oh, yes.

1872
01:32:41,176 --> 01:32:45,456
Thanks.

1873
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,319
Well, well, little one.

1874
01:32:46,422 --> 01:32:48,114
Hello.

1875
01:32:48,217 --> 01:32:50,219
Jan, you've been discovered.

1876
01:32:50,323 --> 01:32:52,394
Vogel called Von
Werder in Bucharest.

1877
01:32:52,497 --> 01:32:53,809
When?
Just now.

1878
01:32:53,913 --> 01:32:54,914
You've got to get out of here.
They'll be coming in a minute.

1879
01:32:55,017 --> 01:32:55,811
[inaudible]

1880
01:32:55,915 --> 01:32:56,674
Not a phone call.

1881
01:32:56,778 --> 01:32:57,986
Anything can happen.

1882
01:32:58,089 --> 01:32:59,953
Von Werder calling the
Gestapo-- anything.

1883
01:33:00,057 --> 01:33:02,300
Jan, Darling, you've got
to leave this second.

1884
01:33:02,404 --> 01:33:03,267
I can't.

1885
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:04,233
Yeah.

1886
01:33:04,337 --> 01:33:05,096
I can't.

1887
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,511
Maruschka, now listen carefully.

1888
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:09,963
Get to Dr. Novotny and
tell him what's happened.

1889
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:11,309
All plans are off.

1890
01:33:11,413 --> 01:33:12,794
I've got to plant those
bombs as soon as I can,

1891
01:33:12,897 --> 01:33:14,381
do you understand?

1892
01:33:14,485 --> 01:33:16,452
And if possible, get Nestor
and the car on the main road,

1893
01:33:16,556 --> 01:33:17,453
right away.

1894
01:33:17,557 --> 01:33:18,523
Oh, Darling, no.

1895
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:20,871
Is that quite clear?

1896
01:33:20,974 --> 01:33:23,874
Oh, yes, but-- Jan,
there isn't time.

1897
01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:26,083
Go ahead then, Maruschka.

1898
01:33:26,186 --> 01:33:28,464
Oh, Jan, I can't leave you.

1899
01:33:28,568 --> 01:33:29,431
[LOUDLY] Do as I tell you.

1900
01:33:29,534 --> 01:33:30,777
Don't come here
bothering me again.

1901
01:33:30,881 --> 01:33:31,571
Be off now.

1902
01:33:31,675 --> 01:33:32,848
Go on.

1903
01:33:32,952 --> 01:33:36,818
Off you get.

1904
01:33:36,921 --> 01:33:38,233
Lover's quarrel, huh?

1905
01:33:38,336 --> 01:34:07,952
You have to put them in
their place now and then.

I thought you did, Colonel.

1917
01:34:38,396 --> 01:34:39,121
One moment.

1918
01:34:39,225 --> 01:34:43,850
Colonel Hausmann, speaking.

1919
01:34:43,954 --> 01:34:45,093
Where are you going?

1920
01:34:45,196 --> 01:34:49,822
I have to see that
all valves are shut.

Less than 20 minutes.

01:39:08,839 --> 01:39:10,116
Now, if we are to go

up there and watch our chance.

1959

Jan, Darling, I
can't come with you.

1962
01:39:16,985 --> 01:39:18,883
What?

1963
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:21,300
You'll always be in my heart.

1964
01:39:21,403 --> 01:39:22,266
There's work to be
done here, still.

Nonsense.

1966
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,203
Maruschka, there is nothing
more you can do for us.

1967
01:39:28,307 --> 01:39:31,310
You are a liability, in fact.

1968
01:39:31,413 --> 01:39:36,177
So, I order you to leave
the country-- in good hands.

1969
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:40,146
Oh, Doctor.

1970
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:42,700
Please, we must get started.

1971
01:39:42,804 --> 01:39:45,117
Well, Doctor, as you said
yourself, words, sometimes,

1972
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,118
are poor things.

1973

01:39:53,194 --> 01:39:54,298
PILOT: Water.

1978
01:39:54,402 --> 01:39:55,196
CAPTAIN STEVENSON:
In a German plane?

1979
01:39:55,299 --> 01:39:56,818
PILOT: It's all right.

1980
01:39:56,921 --> 01:40:09,072
We have prearranged signals-- 20
miles offshore, by secret code.

1981
01:40:09,175 --> 01:40:26,986
[airplane engines]

1982
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:28,229
Perfect.

1983
01:40:28,332 --> 01:40:30,196
Now is our chance.

1984
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:34,545
If we don't get away with this,
you'll always know, won't you?

1985
01:40:34,649 --> 01:40:38,929
Always.

1986
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:39,930
Come on.

1987
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:48,214
[whistling]

1988
01:40:48,318 --> 01:40:49,802
Coffee!

1989
01:40:49,905 --> 01:40:52,874
I'll bet you all the
marks in your pocket.

1990
01:40:52,977 --> 01:40:54,117
Hands up!

1991
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,221
Right up and keep them up.

1992
01:40:55,325 --> 01:41:04,334
All clear, Bumpy.

1993
01:41:04,437 --> 01:41:06,957
[gunshot] Get over there
and face that wall.

1994
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:08,062
Quickly!

1995
01:41:08,165 --> 01:41:08,993
Get in there.

1996
01:41:09,097 --> 01:41:15,103
Keep your hands up.

1997
01:41:15,207 --> 01:41:17,174
[gunfire]

1998
01:41:17,278 --> 01:41:25,044
Keep them up!

1999
01:41:25,148 --> 01:41:26,183
After him!

2000
01:41:26,287 --> 01:41:47,342
[airplane engine roaring]

2001
01:41:47,446 --> 01:41:48,309
PILOT: Are you all right?

2002
01:41:48,412 --> 01:41:54,177
Fine.

2003
01:41:54,280 --> 01:42:07,328
Headquarters!

2004
01:42:07,431 --> 01:42:15,784
They're taking off.

2005
01:42:15,888 --> 01:42:24,931
PILOT: If we get to that
cloud, we will lose them.

2006
01:42:25,035 --> 01:42:26,174
What then?

2007
01:42:26,278 --> 01:42:27,313
Snow!

2008
01:42:27,417 --> 01:42:32,007
What?

2009
01:42:32,111 --> 01:42:37,461
Just a simple little wedding.

2010
01:42:37,565 --> 01:42:39,083
[church bells]
