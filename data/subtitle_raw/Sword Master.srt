1
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,667
Gratitude on one end,

2
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,376
resentment on the other.

3
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,709
Like life and death, how can one expect more?

4
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,000
Live your life to the fullest,

5
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:20,001
no matter what you're destined for.

6
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,209
You're the backstabbing assassin,

7
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,542
Yen Shih-san?

8
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:25,751
Indeed.

9
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:28,792
Tell me who ordered you to kill my brother,

10
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,043
and I'll spare your life!

11
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,709
When will these grudges end?

12
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:33,793
Kao,

13
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,209
your brother was evil and deserved to die.

14
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,375
Tell me

15
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:38,793
or you die tonight.

16
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,542
My life is useless.

17
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:41,917
You can have it.

18
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:52,417
Only the Third Master sways a sword so fast!

19
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,542
What amazing technique!

20
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:55,709
Impressive!

21
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:18,917
Third Master is incredible!

22
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,917
His reputation is well deserved!

23
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,292
Astounding!

24
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,417
Did you hear that?

25
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:25,793
Quickly kill the Third Master,

26
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:26,376
and only then

27
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,375
can you make a name for yourself

28
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,500
in the martial world.

29
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,084
And

30
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,126
if he kills you,

31
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:33,043
I can sell

32
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,167
your Lethal 13-Sword

33
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,751
at a good price.

34
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,000
Drink less!

35
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,042
Alcohol will weaken you...

36
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:50,751
and you won't be able to kill the Third Master!

37
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:58,917
"With his frosty sword, the Third Master reigns
the martial world with great ease."

38
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:20,043
How come they're here?

39
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,917
Fine, if you want to die,

40
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:30,334
I'm leaving!

41
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,626
Swordsman Yen,

42
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,834
my mistress awaits you.

43
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:39,917
Have you prepared liquor?

44
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:41,292
Only the best.

45
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,917
You're Chu?

46
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,876
Yes, I am.

47
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:47,001
Your name means bamboo snake.

48
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,834
It's venomous.

49
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,834
Swordsman Yen.

50
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:02,709
I prepared 100,000 taels of silver

51
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,751
for Kao to kill a man.

52
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,042
But now Kao is dead.

53
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,250
So, to whom

54
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,667
should I give this silver?

55
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,001
Your eyes

56
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,168
are like misty rain.

57
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,209
Hazy with grief.

58
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,542
Do we share the same fate?

59
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,792
I grew up

60
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,751
with this man.

61
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,959
We were childhood sweethearts.

62
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:33,209
But on our wedding day...

63
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:35,334
he walked out on me.

64
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,626
I refused many eligible bachelors

65
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:39,667
just to wait for him.

66
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,667
But the waiting became too painful.

67
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,542
I was happy to marry anyone

68
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,168
to end my pining.

69
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:48,709
On the wedding day,

70
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,959
he came back.

71
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:54,418
He took me away

72
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,501
only to abandon me again.

73
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,376
This man

74
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,917
is the Third Master...

75
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:04,293
of the Supreme Sword Manor...

76
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:06,584
at Green Lake, under Jade Peak.

77
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,250
As a woman,

78
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,584
I can accept being abandoned.

79
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,876
But as a daughter,

80
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:18,543
I can't stand

81
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:22,084
my family being dishonored.

82
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,084
Kill him for me.

83
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,417
The most attractive thing about women

84
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,500
is how they can be mired in their hatred

85
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,459
for those they once loved.

86
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,542
However...

87
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,042
do you really want him dead?

88
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,250
At all costs.

89
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:41,542
Then...

90
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:44,001
Would you pay with your body?

91
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:47,875
I believe

92
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,750
you don't know who I am.

93
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,417
You're from the Four Great Clans.

94
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:55,001
The Young Mistress of Seven-Star Pool,

95
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:56,792
Mu-yung Chiu-ti.

96
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,917
I have only one reason

97
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,209
to kill him.

98
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,000
It's for myself.

99
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:11,001
The Third Master's swordplay
isn't so scary after all.

100
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,584
If even you can't kill him...

101
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,459
no one can.

102
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,209
Hey, Yen,

103
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:51,418
I can't swim.

104
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,209
So my journey ends here.

105
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,959
Take care of yourself.

106
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,626
See that?

107
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,209
It looks like...

108
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,876
a feast for challengers...

109
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,542
but it actually serves to distract you.

110
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,459
I think...

111
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,709
you should nap on the boat.

112
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:05,584
<i>I...</i>

113
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,917
I sharpen my blade on talkative men's throats.

114
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,001
My lord.

115
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,501
This way please.

116
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,042
The cuckoos sing so sadly...

117
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,500
saying it's better to go.

118
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,501
How affectionate they are.

119
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,043
This vast world

120
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,459
is full of heartbroken people.

121
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:03,292
The Hsieh Clan appears strong.

122
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,375
But who would know

123
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,042
that the old lord of the Supreme Sword Manor

124
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,876
has nothing to bear

125
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,459
but the misfortunes of his children?

126
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,959
My oldest son was slow-witted

127
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:16,001
and died young.

128
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,375
My oldest daughter married a swordsman.

129
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:20,084
They made a handsome couple.

130
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,375
But they were too haughty

131
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,876
and got murdered for it.

132
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,334
My second son was cowardly.

133
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,167
He pined for a servant girl

134
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,251
but dared not tell.

135
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,043
Eventually...

136
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:33,709
he died of grief.

137
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,625
My third son Hsiao-feng

138
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:41,167
became the sole hope of the Hsieh Clan.

139
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:44,043
Since our first ancestor founded our school

140
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,417
three centuries ago,

141
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:50,543
no descendant could master the Supreme Sword

142
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,542
except him.

143
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:54,626
Only he could be one with the sword.

144
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:57,626
He was just <i>1</i> then.

145
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,709
Why do you tell me your family affairs?

146
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,542
Because I hope you can

147
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,042
have more tolerance for him.

148
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,376
Where is your son?

149
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,918
You will see him soon.

150
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:53,209
Hsiao-feng has been dead for 37 days.

151
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,667
Desecrating his memorial
is like defiling his corpse!

152
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,209
The Hsieh Clan won't bear such an insult.

153
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,418
The insult must be washed with blood.

154
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,417
Formation!

155
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:43,959
Stop.

156
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,251
Don't be rude!

157
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,626
Swordsman Yen...

158
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,793
losing your greatest rival

159
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,376
is like losing your soul mate.

160
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,459
Life becomes very lonely.

161
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:08,876
I understand how you feel.

162
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,043
I have been discourteous.

163
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:21,959
Take care.

164
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:35,501
I never knew a hitman

165
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,250
could have such internal force.

166
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,043
How many more talents

167
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:42,751
has the Divine Might recruited?

168
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,668
Without the Third Master,

169
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,500
we can no longer rule the martial world.

170
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,584
To save the lives of our clansmen,

171
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,001
seal off the mountain now

172
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,584
and announce our withdrawal
from the martial world!

173
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,126
Hey!

174
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,375
You're still alive!

175
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,459
If you're alive, that means he's dead!

176
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,000
Fantastic!

177
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,834
Where is the Third Master's sword?

178
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,043
You didn't forget it, did you?

179
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:25,751
Hey!

180
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,084
Are you crazy or stupid?

181
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,834
We all do a few stupid things in our lives.

182
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,418
You can't swim, for example.

183
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,459
"SEVEN-STAR POOL"

184
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,084
You can't die!

185
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,626
How can you die?

186
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,876
Do you remember what I said?

187
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,584
Mistress said...

188
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,417
if the Third Master dies,

189
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,167
all his servant girls

190
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,959
must go serve him in the afterlife.

191
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,251
If you want to blame someone,

192
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:11,293
blame him.

193
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,001
Mistress...

194
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,917
The Third Master's death

195
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,292
is only a rumor.

196
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,000
It may be false.

197
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,626
Let me put your sword away.

198
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:30,626
Don't let hatred take root in your heart.

199
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,417
A sword sheathed unwillingly

200
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:33,501
is dangerous.

201
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,250
Chu Ye-ching...

202
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,918
you've been my page since childhood.

203
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,459
After all these years...

204
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,750
it's time you get married.

205
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:05,001
You're so concerned about her life.

206
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:07,709
I'll give her to you as a bride.

207
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,209
I love someone else.

208
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,709
She doesn't love you.

209
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,626
Ling!

210
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,084
I'm willing to wait.

211
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,042
You are unworthy of her.

212
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,417
One day, I will be.

213
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,417
The universe is merciless, ghosts and gods blind.

214
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,501
All things are incapable, men ignorant.

215
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,875
Life is impermanent, weal and woe abound.

216
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,667
Divine and demonic, all bow to my might.

217
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,543
Black Goblin and Thunder Tiger will corroborate

218
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:16,334
the death of Hsieh Hsiao-feng.

219
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:17,293
Find out if it's true.

220
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:18,834
Yes.

221
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,584
If it is,

222
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:22,459
we'll attack the Supreme Sword Manor.

223
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,459
After we seize it, every clan will be vanquished

224
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:27,543
and regard us as rulers of the martial world.

225
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,667
We, the scum of the martial world,

226
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,084
didn't turn into ghosts in hell

227
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,834
but dragged out an ignoble
existence on this earth...

228
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,834
just for this day!

229
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:36,418
You scum of the earth.

230
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:39,417
You'll be damned for your evil deeds!

231
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,042
The Supreme Sword Manor...

232
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,876
will enforce justice on behalf of Heaven.

233
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,084
Kill them.

234
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,125
"BITTER SEA TOWN"

235
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:08,584
Get lost.

236
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:13,167
Sir.

237
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,084
Just calm down.

238
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:18,500
Come again.

239
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,167
Goodbye.

240
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,334
You stink!

241
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,917
I love judging people by their appearance.

242
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,584
You look like a free loader.

243
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:38,542
As long as you have money,

244
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:39,792
no matter how stinky you are,

245
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,918
you're welcome in the Dawn Moon House!

246
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,500
We have a big spender!

247
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,125
Sir, you are late!

248
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,250
Sir, choose me!

249
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,667
Sir!

250
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,042
Choose me!

251
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,834
Where's his money?

252
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,209
Sir, wake up.

253
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:15,250
You haven't paid for 5 days of drinking!

254
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,334
I'm broke.

255
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:17,959
You're broke?

256
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,667
Oh, alright.

257
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:22,584
Well...

258
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:25,042
do you have a name?

259
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:25,959
No-.

260
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,000
No?

261
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:28,668
Let me give you one then.

262
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,043
We'll call you...

263
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:30,876
Ah Chi.

264
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:32,126
Ah Chi.

265
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:33,501
I won't waste time lecturing.

266
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:35,709
You should know what happens next.

267
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,667
Get to work!

268
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:47,542
Buy more, I'll give you a discount.

269
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:49,167
This rouge is nice.

270
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:55,625
What are you doing?

271
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,251
Ah Chi.

272
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:58,500
Come here.

273
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,834
Empty my chamber pot.

274
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,626
Come on.

275
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,376
He's really doing it.

276
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,584
How can you do it like this?

277
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,084
What's his problem?

278
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,667
My wish was his command.

279
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:28,542
Let's call him Useless Chi.

280
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:39,834
Stop watching.

281
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:41,543
Just a second.

282
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:44,584
Here comes Mr. Chang.

283
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,417
Hello there, sir.

284
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:53,167
I'm sorry, sir.

285
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,334
Get outta here.

286
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,042
Mr. Chang.

287
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:02,751
Let me pound your shoulders.

288
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:05,251
Stay away from my client. Get lost.

289
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:06,584
Go, go,

290
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,334
How about a drink?

291
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,667
Mr. Tao, how long has it been?

292
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,501
I'll refill your cup, here...

293
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,542
What the...

294
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,042
You puked all over me!

295
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:24,875
Peony.

296
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:26,542
Waiter!

297
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:27,876
Clean this up.

298
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,834
Take care of him for me.

299
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,876
Li, take good care of him.

300
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,250
Sir, sir.

301
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,250
Come here.

302
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:50,001
Sir, take a rest.

303
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:51,584
I'll clean your hands.

304
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,209
Don't tell anyone!

305
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:10,542
This one is for you.

306
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,542
Are you crazy?

307
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:27,459
You don't want gold beads?

308
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:34,751
Catch.

309
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:36,668
Be gentle!

310
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:37,709
Quiet.

311
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,876
That hurts!

312
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,292
Don't pull me. That hurts!

313
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,000
Go, quickly.

314
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,751
Now, my clothes.

315
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:00,875
Go ahead.

316
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,709
Rich men pay 100 taels to touch me.

317
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,501
A boatman, only 10 strings of coins.

318
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,876
Some gentlemen they are.

319
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,209
They still go whoring.

320
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,959
Only they do it like thieves.

321
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:19,918
How long have you been there?

322
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,209
Were you a brothel's errand boy before?

323
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:25,542
What a loser!

324
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:27,376
In today's world,

325
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,250
fighters make the most money.

326
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,959
You should be a swordsman!

327
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,417
Do you want a taste of my body?

328
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,917
I'll let you sleep with me once

329
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,042
for getting me out of that brothel.

330
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,668
I don't sleep with women on condition.

331
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,209
My god.

332
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:58,793
I don't want to stay at that place anymore.

333
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:07,876
An old monk gathered herbs from the mountains...

334
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,209
and studied medical tomes...

335
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,917
so as to alleviate his patients' sufferings.

336
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:17,459
After he discovered this ancient panacea spring,

337
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:19,043
he moved here for good

338
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,334
and spent his life by the spring.

339
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,043
The medicine he made with the spring water

340
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:27,792
saved countless lives.

341
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:29,709
This way please.

342
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:42,043
Master,

343
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,375
this is my medical record.

344
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,834
Please tell me...

345
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:47,334
are there hopes of a cure?

346
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,959
I don't need that.

347
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:50,793
Your sickness

348
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,500
is caused by excessive hard labor

349
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:55,292
and injury since childhood.

350
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,834
They've ruined your internal circulation.

351
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:01,042
Now,

352
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:04,126
your meridians are blocked and misaligned.

353
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:06,876
There is no cure.

354
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:13,792
A Golden Wound Pill.

355
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:17,126
It won't prolong your life, but it cures wounds.

356
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,584
You don't have much time left.

357
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:24,084
Put aside your worries, resentment,

358
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,168
and worldly affairs...

359
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:30,042
perhaps there's still a slim chance of hope.

360
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:31,626
Cart driver.

361
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,209
100 taels for your cart and liquor.

362
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:38,667
100 taels?

363
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:39,876
Not enough?

364
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:41,292
Enough, enough.

365
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:47,292
Thank you!

366
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,417
Wait.

367
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:53,334
Swordsman...

368
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,709
you're not changing your mind, are you?

369
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,584
You're a rich man now.

370
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,709
If you knew you'd die soon,

371
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:00,417
where would you go?

372
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,126
Bitter Sea Town.

373
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,042
Why?

374
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:04,959
I've toiled all my life

375
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,293
without any enjoyment.

376
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,209
The town offers good food, wine, and women.

377
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,918
Of course I want to sink into them.

378
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:12,584
Where would you want to be buried?

379
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,959
The Hundred-Flower Forest on that mountain.

380
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:18,000
The cemetary there is a paradise.

381
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,084
It's beautiful!

382
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:23,251
Well, horse...

383
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:25,459
you've toiled your whole life too.

384
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:28,834
You can retire with me here.

385
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:34,625
Gravedigger,

386
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:40,001
I'll give you 100 taels for your shed and tools.

387
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:43,417
Money is of no use to me.

388
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:47,543
Dig my grave and bury me,

389
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:52,001
and the shed is yours.

390
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:11,376
Thank you.

391
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,376
Your girl is the cheapest.

392
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,750
Everytime I come to Bitter Sea Town I want her.

393
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,667
She just moans and shouts.

394
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:47,542
Excuse me!

395
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:49,875
Sir,

396
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,209
you haven't paid.

397
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:53,084
Your service was poor.

398
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:53,959
I won't pay-

399
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:59,918
No one works harder than a prostitute.

400
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,584
Not paying will bring bad luck.

401
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,959
You're cursing me?

402
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:04,751
Oh, I wouldn't dare!

403
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,376
It's fine if you don't help me save face,

404
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:10,292
but you'd help out the Big Boss, right?

405
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,584
The Big Boss can go to hell!

406
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,626
Today my whoring is free.

407
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:18,501
You can't leave! Give me the money.

408
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,500
No money!

409
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,625
Get them!

410
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:30,834
Get up.

411
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:31,876
Useless!

412
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:33,834
They work hard for their money.

413
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:35,084
You must pay.

414
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:36,501
Do you want to die?

415
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,250
Yes.

416
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:39,917
Grant his wish.

417
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:21,167
Let's go.

418
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:25,834
Ah Chi.

419
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:27,501
Does it hurt?

420
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,709
Will you die?

421
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:09,959
Ah Chi...

422
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,126
you let yourself get stabbed

423
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,084
because you like me, right?

424
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,542
All I know is that

425
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:22,292
<i>2</i> taels of silver are important to you.

426
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,834
Do you like my body?

427
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,250
You've earned it with your life.

428
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:38,459
Ah Chi.

429
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,834
What are you doing here?

430
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,084
Taking care of him.

431
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,292
Ah Chi.

432
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:52,459
I'm so worried about you.

433
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,126
The Big Boss just gave the order

434
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,625
to have those two brought here

435
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,334
so that you can vent your anger!

436
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,001
You're lucky, do you know that?

437
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:04,125
The Big Boss wants you to be his disciple.

438
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,875
If he sees much in you,

439
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:11,125
you'll have a bright future!

440
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:18,501
Take good care of him.

441
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:27,834
What's wrong?

442
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,418
I can't stay here.

443
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,293
Don't beg of him.

444
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,959
He's already forgotten about us.

445
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:33,501
Stop that, young man.

446
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:40,001
Are you hopeless because you've no way out,

447
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,084
or do you want to die and start over?

448
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,418
All I know is...

449
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:46,376
it's meaningless to live on.

450
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:48,834
If even death can't scare you,

451
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,584
come help me collect night soil.

452
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,084
Are you afraid of dirty work?

453
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:54,709
Aside from killing,

454
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:56,750
I'll do any kind of work.

455
00:33:57,376 --> 00:33:58,709
In your state,

456
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,292
you can't even kill a chicken.

457
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,959
Here, fill your stomach.

458
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,126
If you work hard,

459
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,751
buns taste much better.

460
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,167
And if buns taste good,

461
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:08,709
you have something to live for.

462
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,543
Understand?

463
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:12,084
Take it

464
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:23,918
Miao...

465
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,459
did you have a good day?

466
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:28,251
Great. Every day gets better.

467
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,000
Miao, you're back.

468
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,292
Fixing your roof?

469
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,792
Kids, come here!

470
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,084
Come see what treats I've brought.

471
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,292
Candy! I want some!

472
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:44,709
Don't push. There's plenty.

473
00:34:48,126 --> 00:34:49,709
Everyone, listen up.

474
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,209
This is the new help I've found.

475
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,500
Let's take care of one another.

476
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:54,750
We will.

477
00:34:58,251 --> 00:34:59,793
My name is Ah Chi.

478
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:01,875
Hi, Ah Chi.

479
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:07,251
You little rat!

480
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,251
Poor kid.

481
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,667
Mom, I'm home!

482
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,125
<i>Son!</i>

483
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:19,834
Mom. You're finally home!

484
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,792
I missed you.

485
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,459
Mom, I only left this morning.

486
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:25,501
Is that so?

487
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:31,500
Who's this?

488
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,334
Madam, my name is Ah Chi.

489
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,125
That's not what you call a poor lady.

490
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,292
Just call me Mama Miao.

491
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:46,667
Look at him.

492
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,251
He's so handsome

493
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,875
and my son is so ugly!

494
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:51,292
Mom!

495
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:53,751
Oh listen to me.

496
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:57,125
My son is handsome too.

497
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,584
Here, the biggest piece of meat.

498
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:00,750
Mom.

499
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:02,334
Ah Chi is a good man.

500
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,334
With one look and one sniff at him,

501
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,209
I already know.

502
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:07,501
Mom,

503
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,209
he'll sleep in my bed tonight.

504
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,168
You don't think he stinks?

505
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:13,917
I stink more than him.

506
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:18,084
Silly boy!

507
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:20,459
You finally found someone stinkier than you!

508
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,584
Oh, my silly son.

509
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:27,459
Wash your feet before bed,

510
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:29,626
or Princess will get mad.

511
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,459
Princess is my younger sister.

512
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:34,750
But, not for real.

513
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,126
Who says not for real?

514
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:39,042
She should have been a princess.

515
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:39,959
That's right.

516
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:42,668
She should have been born a princess.

517
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:46,043
She works as a servant in a rich man's house,

518
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,584
so that our family can afford meat.

519
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:50,668
She only comes home once a month.

520
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,251
My baby girl...

521
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,250
has a hard life.

522
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,334
We're proud of her.

523
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:58,667
If you meet her, you'll definitely like her!

524
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,292
Won't he, mom?

525
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:02,668
You wash first.

526
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,042
Wow that stinks.

527
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:14,543
Now listen,

528
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,626
even though this is dirty work,

529
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,834
there are rules all the same.

530
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:19,793
The stool itself

531
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:20,876
is called Human Gold.

532
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:22,084
The liquid dung

533
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:23,001
is called Gold Juice.

534
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:24,543
The smell

535
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,042
is called Osmanthus Fragrance.

536
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:27,542
Aren't these names classy?

537
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:29,501
Let's go.

538
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,750
To make us less obnoxious,

539
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,501
we remind people to get out of our way.

540
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,751
Here's how:

541
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:40,084
Human Gold, Osmanthus Fragrance
and Gold Juice coming.

542
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:42,918
Look out!

543
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,792
Human Gold.

544
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,584
Osmanthus Fragrance.

545
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:48,918
Gold Juice coming.

546
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,292
Look out!

547
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:58,875
What's the matter?

548
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:01,376
I can't earn this money!

549
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,209
He treats me like I'm not human!

550
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,792
Madam Han.

551
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:06,959
Get your butt in here.

552
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,251
Coming,

553
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,251
coming.

554
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:24,250
The client said

555
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,625
he'll add 50 taels.

556
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:30,792
So in total 100 taels.

557
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,042
I'll go!

558
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:33,292
Li, don't!

559
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,251
I'm sure it'll be fine.

560
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,250
Li, you're such a good girl.

561
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,250
Come on.

562
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:53,626
Come.

563
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:16,167
Chi, get up, time for breakfast.

564
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:27,376
Princess brought us a feast!

565
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,709
Come sit down.

566
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,084
Come on.

567
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,584
Ah Chi...

568
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:39,626
this is our Princess.

569
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:40,918
Princess.

570
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,126
Eat.

571
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:42,917
Thank you.

572
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,875
The biggest piece is for you.

573
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,084
Here.

574
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:48,418
Princess, would you like it?

575
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:50,792
You eat it, be my guest.

576
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:52,917
From now on, you just call her Sweetie.

577
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:54,376
That's what we call her.

578
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,459
Right.

579
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:56,501
Dig in.

580
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:58,334
You need the energy for work.

581
00:40:59,001 --> 00:40:59,876
Sweetie, for you.

582
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,209
Thanks, mom.

583
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,251
Delicious.

584
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:04,125
Eat.

585
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:09,959
We're going home!

586
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,042
You were beaten?

587
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:16,251
You don't think I'm a disgrace?

588
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:17,543
No-.

589
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:22,709
I'm not going back.

590
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:25,459
But what if they come for you?

591
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,376
There's a man by my side who'd take a stab for me.

592
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:34,834
Nothing in the world can scare me now.

593
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:37,417
I know

594
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:39,751
you'll protect me.

595
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,042
I'll tell you a secret.

596
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:47,376
I've saved over 100 taels

597
00:41:47,459 --> 00:41:49,251
and many gold beads.

598
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,334
I want to buy a piece of land

599
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,543
and start a farm with my family.

600
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:07,043
Whatever I earn from now on is yours.

601
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:18,376
The dirtiest whore

602
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:21,167
is to serve the dirtiest client.

603
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,167
Li is gone,

604
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,501
so who will serve that dirtiest client?

605
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:28,542
You.

606
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:30,417
Me?

607
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:32,876
Big Boss, I am old.

608
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,584
What should we do?

609
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,126
Send someone to get her back.

610
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:38,543
Do it then.

611
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,667
But Li is with that Useless Chi.

612
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,709
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

613
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:44,709
Big Boss...

614
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,043
you should send someone capable.

615
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,001
Nameless...

616
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:53,626
how long have you followed me?

617
00:42:54,334 --> 00:42:55,834
A year and 3 months.

618
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:59,334
I've spent some 1000 taels on you.

619
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:01,251
You're a good boss.

620
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:04,417
I've never asked your background.

621
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,334
And I only know you

622
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,543
are called Big Boss.

623
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,459
Divine and demonic, all bow to my might.

624
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:14,209
I am at the Divine Might's service.

625
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:18,043
It's time to flex your muscles.

626
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:20,251
Find out the background of this man

627
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:21,959
who was stabbed 4 times and didn't flinch.

628
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,625
If he's useful, spare him.

629
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:24,418
If not,

630
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:25,459
kill him.

631
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:36,251
Good craftsmanship.

632
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:40,334
Thank you, boss.

633
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:05,001
This one is nice.

634
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,875
Right, Sweetie, we need more bowls.

635
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:12,084
Look at this one.

636
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:12,834
Not bad.

637
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:14,043
Li.

638
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:16,501
The Big Boss wants you to come back.

639
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:21,751
My debt is already paid off. I'm not going back.

640
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,792
No more bullshit!

641
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:24,043
Let's go.

642
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:25,459
What are you doing?

643
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:26,084
Come with me.

644
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:27,834
Let her go!

645
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:30,667
I'm taking her back to the brothel.

646
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,834
What?

647
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:33,042
What did you just say?

648
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:38,792
Beat him to death.

649
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:41,251
Stop it! Let go!

650
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,584
Outta my way.

651
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:43,709
Mom!

652
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:44,792
Mom!

653
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:48,584
Get up.

654
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:49,792
Go.

655
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:50,917
Come with me.

656
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:52,126
Let me go!

657
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:00,751
No. Stop fighting!

658
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:01,834
Stop fighting, Brother.

659
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:05,292
You bit me.

660
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,418
- Mom!
- Miao.

661
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:19,459
What do you want?

662
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:20,834
The poor can't be bullied so easily!

663
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,084
What's on his back?

664
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:52,792
Make way.

665
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:56,542
"R.l.P. YEN SHIH-SAN"

666
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:00,375
Third...

667
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:03,167
Yen...

668
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:05,418
I said make way!

669
00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:07,084
Yen...

670
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:16,500
Damned busybody!

671
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:37,542
Thank you, Mr. Swordsman!

672
00:46:49,084 --> 00:46:50,209
Big Boss!

673
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:51,751
I saw them!

674
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,709
They're going to fight a duel.

675
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,584
What are you talking about?

676
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:56,917
Third Master...

677
00:46:57,084 --> 00:47:00,376
will fight a duel with Yen Shih-San!

678
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:03,542
Mom...

679
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:04,876
I'm fine.

680
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:15,834
Silly boy, what are you doing?

681
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,792
Get up.

682
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:20,167
This happened because those villains...

683
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:23,542
think they can just trample on the poor.

684
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:26,709
I wonder where that swordsman lives.

685
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:28,793
It'd be great if he could teach Chi kung fu.

686
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,375
I know, I know!

687
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:32,584
He lives at the graveyard.

688
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:37,500
Swordsman!

689
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:39,168
Swordsman!

690
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:41,293
You fought off those villains...

691
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:44,251
we come here to thank you.

692
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:46,209
Thank you, Swordsman.

693
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:49,834
Swordsman, please teach Chi kung fu.

694
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:52,084
Everyone calls him Useless Chi.

695
00:47:52,126 --> 00:47:54,459
It breaks my heart hearing it.

696
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,625
Swordsman.

697
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,834
This is the only sword in our village.

698
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,584
Cut me.

699
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:38,917
He's indeed useless.

700
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,042
Unteachable.

701
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,542
If you won't teach Chi kung fu,

702
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,334
it means you're unwilling to help the poor

703
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:45,543
fight the Big Boss's villains.

704
00:48:46,084 --> 00:48:47,084
Beat it!

705
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:48,667
Aren't wandering swordsmen

706
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:50,084
supposed to protect people from harm?

707
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:52,167
What kind of a swordsman are you?

708
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:53,459
Yeah!

709
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:55,334
You know kung fu, why don't you teach us?

710
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,459
There were so many of you.

711
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:00,168
Why didn't you fight them?

712
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:02,376
Why didn't you help yourselves?

713
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:03,792
Beat it!

714
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:09,084
These wandering swordsmen

715
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:11,376
only use their talents to make money.

716
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:13,084
They don't care about us ordinary people!

717
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:14,792
Miao, let's go.

718
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:16,334
Let's go.

719
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:17,834
We're leaving.

720
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:19,334
Mom...

721
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:21,584
don't expect help from him.

722
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:52,542
"DAWN MOON HOUSE"

723
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:57,125
Sir!

724
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:10,542
Get him!

725
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:19,959
Where is the Big Boss?

726
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:21,000
Inside.

727
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:25,501
Big Boss is inside.

728
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:40,959
Don't kill me!

729
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:49,376
Everything can be bargained.

730
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:50,792
Name your price!

731
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:57,543
I don't want your filthy money.

732
00:50:58,126 --> 00:50:59,584
Don't go too far.

733
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:02,751
It's sad to see a good sword in an evil man's hand.

734
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,001
I lead the Divine Might's branch here.

735
00:51:05,126 --> 00:51:07,959
Killing me makes you an enemy of the Divine Might.

736
00:51:08,126 --> 00:51:10,876
The Divine Might's lackeys deserve to die.

737
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,834
Swordsman, please, save us!

738
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:16,168
Kill him!

739
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:18,417
Save us!

740
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:30,209
People of Bitter Sea Town, listen.

741
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:33,918
Yen is no longer a selfish man!

742
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:35,876
Starting today...

743
00:51:36,251 --> 00:51:39,418
I will use the rest of my life to do good.

744
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:52,501
What's going on?

745
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,417
Miao and Mama Miao...

746
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:55,084
Big Boss is dead.

747
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:56,959
Really?

748
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:58,209
That's great news!

749
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:31,001
Here.

750
00:52:32,376 --> 00:52:34,626
I want one too.

751
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:36,751
Hey, come get some candy!

752
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:37,959
Don't give him candy.

753
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:40,209
He always bullies us.

754
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:44,834
Smash him.

755
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:46,376
You've always bulled us with that knife.

756
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,584
Don't fight.

757
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:50,542
Candy.

758
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,501
Hey.

759
00:52:54,334 --> 00:52:55,334
Come with me.

760
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,625
I've decided to teach you swordplay.

761
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:59,209
Why?

762
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:01,417
Because I want to.

763
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:03,500
I don't want to be a swordsman.

764
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:07,668
Is it because you lost a fight once?

765
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,084
My days are numbered.

766
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:15,876
After I die,

767
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,751
the 13-Sword Style I created will be lost.

768
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:20,668
It will be a pity.

769
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:22,709
The Third Master is dead.

770
00:53:23,042 --> 00:53:24,625
After learning my swordplay...

771
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:26,418
you will be the world's best swordsman.

772
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,126
You will become the Useful Chi.

773
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:31,167
No one will ever kick you around again.

774
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,709
I know you've learned kung fu.

775
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:38,042
Tell me does the sight of blood sicken you

776
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:39,126
or are you afraid of death?

777
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:40,001
Both.

778
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:41,001
Coward!

779
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:42,043
I am.

780
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:47,751
Actually,

781
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:49,917
I am also afraid of death,

782
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:52,750
and the sight of blood sickens me too.

783
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:00,167
I started learning swordplay at 10.

784
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:02,001
I was enlightened at 13.

785
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,292
By 20, I'd read every book on it.

786
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:07,418
Since then, I've defeated every opponent.

787
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:08,959
Listen well.

788
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:10,834
The 13-Sword Style is based upon

789
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,376
the potential of a thousand cuts.

790
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,417
It moves like the flick of a finger,

791
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:35,250
a quiet breeze, and breathes like still water,

792
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:38,043
casting no shadow and leaving no trace.

793
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:43,793
Like all rivers run into the sea,

794
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:45,376
all the moves are eventually one.

795
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:15,500
The Lethal 13-Sword can only be sensed

796
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:17,584
through its spirit, but not its form.

797
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:23,459
The Third Master divided
the Hsieh Clan Style into two.

798
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:25,417
He held a separate sword in both hands,

799
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:27,668
turning 72 moves into 144

800
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:28,959
and making changes unpredictably.

801
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:30,959
To beat Third Master,

802
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:32,001
you cannot use force.

803
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:33,250
You must be agile.

804
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:37,084
Hsiao-feng...

805
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,917
I've been exploring for 8 years

806
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:40,334
and practicing hard.

807
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:43,125
I've always wanted to fight you in my heart.

808
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:45,667
Today, before the gods,

809
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:48,917
I curse your soul in hell!

810
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:33,834
Remember...

811
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:38,084
focus on the sword's soul, not its formula.

812
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:48,542
If after drinking to the utmost

813
00:56:48,626 --> 00:56:50,543
you still aren't even a bit tipsy,

814
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:52,750
then drinking becomes meaningless.

815
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:56,667
When you know the result of everything you do,

816
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:58,501
living becomes meaningless.

817
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:01,209
You have a knot in the mind.

818
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:03,584
Since the beginning of my career,

819
00:57:04,251 --> 00:57:06,126
I have lived in the Third Master's shadow.

820
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:08,168
No matter how hard I worked,

821
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:11,126
everything I did became part of his legend.

822
00:57:14,209 --> 00:57:15,626
In the martial world,

823
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:18,001
we all want our names to be left behind.

824
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:22,209
So I went to the Supreme Sword Manor
to challenge him.

825
00:57:22,584 --> 00:57:23,709
If I won,

826
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:25,250
I would become famous.

827
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:27,293
If I lost to him,

828
00:57:27,584 --> 00:57:29,542
still my life would not be in vain.

829
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:31,501
Unfortunately,

830
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:34,292
that little bastard died.

831
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:36,126
What a pity.

832
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:40,168
After I die,

833
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:42,626
I want you to tell the world...

834
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,667
that Yen Shih-san was Yen Shih-san,

835
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:46,709
and not that bastard the Third Master.

836
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,501
Fine.

837
00:57:50,126 --> 00:57:50,793
<i>I will.</i>

838
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:55,000
To avoid being bullied,

839
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:57,917
I tattooed my face and pretended to be a villain.

840
00:57:58,376 --> 00:58:00,918
Unfortunately, after I turned ugly,

841
00:58:02,084 --> 00:58:04,126
I became a true villain.

842
00:58:07,459 --> 00:58:09,376
I didn't only kill for money,

843
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:11,501
I also killed dishonorably.

844
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:14,126
Now retribution overtakes me.

845
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:18,584
I need to go guard my grave.

846
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:21,792
I won't see you again.

847
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:45,959
Thank you for taking care of Chi for me.

848
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:47,834
Please accept my gratitude.

849
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:51,584
Ah Chi...

850
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:54,876
is the Third Master of the Supreme Sword Manor.

851
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:56,667
I am his fiancee,

852
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:58,168
Mu-yung Chiu-ti.

853
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:03,292
I've been in love with him since I was 14

854
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:06,126
and was sure he'd be my future husband.

855
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:09,417
My parents arranged for our engagement.

856
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,375
He kept leaving

857
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:15,209
to avoid shouldering the burden of two clans.

858
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,834
But we can't live without him.

859
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:19,418
Alright,

860
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:20,459
so you want to take him away?

861
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:21,626
Yes.

862
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:23,084
What if he doesn't want to go?

863
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:24,293
In that case,

864
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:27,292
you'll have to force him.

865
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:28,626
I won't!

866
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:31,918
You were working hard to leave this place.

867
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,792
Why make him stay?

868
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:35,459
<i>I...</i>

869
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:42,834
If I don't leave,

870
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:44,959
what will you do to her?

871
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:53,375
Hsiao-feng...

872
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,667
you should know me by now.

873
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,334
Thank you for all you've done.

874
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:09,042
You've been true friends to me.

875
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:11,167
I won't forget it.

876
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:44,876
Why are you lying here?

877
01:00:45,292 --> 01:00:47,042
I'm waiting to die. Leave me alone.

878
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:48,667
You can't die yet!

879
01:00:49,084 --> 01:00:50,001
Why not?

880
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:52,626
Because Third Master isn't dead.

881
01:00:53,376 --> 01:00:54,043
And I don't know why

882
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,876
he gave himself such a stupid name.

883
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:58,084
What was it...

884
01:00:58,251 --> 01:00:59,334
Useless Chi.

885
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:07,751
What did you say?

886
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:09,209
He's not dead?

887
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:11,834
Say it again!

888
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:13,959
The Third Master isn't dead.

889
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:16,043
He calls himself Useless Chi now.

890
01:01:18,584 --> 01:01:19,792
You've been missing him like mad.

891
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:20,959
Go find him!

892
01:01:21,084 --> 01:01:23,292
I fished up your sword from the lake.

893
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,167
Catch!

894
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:39,376
I won't ever beat him in my life.

895
01:01:39,626 --> 01:01:40,418
Why not?

896
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:42,167
I have absolute confidence in you!

897
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:44,375
I taught him all my techniques.

898
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:54,834
Hsiao-feng...

899
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,167
we were so good together.

900
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:03,084
Why can't good things last?

901
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:11,875
Your name is Chiu-ti?

902
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:13,042
Yes.

903
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:16,501
What an awful name!

904
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:22,042
The Supreme Sword Manor, for 3 centuries...

905
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:23,917
has ruled the martial world

906
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:26,501
and held the title of the Top Sword Master.

907
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:30,709
Today Lord Hsieh passes on power to Hsiao-feng,

908
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:35,043
in hopes that he will prosper
and protect the martial world.

909
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:20,917
Hsiao-feng...

910
01:03:22,251 --> 01:03:23,584
if you like,

911
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:27,042
I'll live in seclusion with you.

912
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:30,876
I only want you to be happy.

913
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:35,792
The Seven-Star Pool has been
befriending swordsmen.

914
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:39,459
The Mu-yung Clan is especially close
with the Hsia Clan.

915
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:41,501
If I don't agree to this marriage,

916
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:42,334
old Mu-yung

917
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:45,250
and the Hsia Clan will certainly unite against me.

918
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:47,584
Does Chiu-ti know it?

919
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:50,751
That girl is more ambitious than her father.

920
01:03:50,876 --> 01:03:52,793
How could she not know?

921
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:57,918
Lord Mu-yung,

922
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,251
my son is a fool.

923
01:04:00,292 --> 01:04:02,500
Today is the wedding day,
and I don't know where he is.

924
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:03,875
Then he's fled!

925
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:05,750
I didn't educate my son well.

926
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:07,001
Lord Hsieh,

927
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,417
you've allowed your conniving son
to ruin my daughter!

928
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:10,667
From now on,

929
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:13,709
the Seven-Star Pool will break off all relations

930
01:04:13,751 --> 01:04:14,876
with the Supreme Sword Manor.

931
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,625
I came here myself to apologize.

932
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:17,792
Yet you still won't forgive me?

933
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:19,167
Must we become enemies?

934
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:20,917
Your son owes me,

935
01:04:21,251 --> 01:04:23,543
and today you must repay the debt.

936
01:04:23,751 --> 01:04:25,043
Lord.

937
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:26,167
Father.

938
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:29,001
Don't be angry!

939
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,542
That wretch in your belly can't be kept!

940
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:37,667
My father died of anger because of us.

941
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,417
Did you know that?

942
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:46,959
Why are we receiving the bride at the back door?

943
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:54,792
Madam mother...

944
01:04:55,084 --> 01:04:57,626
the Mu-yung and Hsia marriage...

945
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:00,293
will obliterate the Supreme Sword Manor.

946
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:07,167
Chiu-ti, come with me.

947
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,000
Why did you come here?

948
01:05:12,459 --> 01:05:13,959
Because you are mine.

949
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:20,917
Daughter!

950
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,293
You can't go!

951
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:24,459
Chiu-ti!

952
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:25,459
Chiu-ti!

953
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:26,584
You swine!

954
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:28,918
You aren't worthy of her!

955
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:36,584
The road at night is dangerous.

956
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:38,251
Let's spend the night here.

957
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:44,501
Chiu-ti.

958
01:05:44,584 --> 01:05:45,959
I want to live a hermetic life.

959
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,209
Will you come with me?

960
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:51,750
I'm tired. Let's sleep first.

961
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:56,792
Mistress!

962
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:58,042
Hsiao-feng wants to quit the martial world.

963
01:05:58,084 --> 01:06:01,584
Bring Lord Hsieh of the
Supreme Sword Manor here now.

964
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,334
Hsiao-feng!

965
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:06,250
Why are you doing this to me?

966
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:10,918
I hate you! I hate you so much!

967
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:13,042
Chiu-ti.

968
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:20,543
This time I'll make it all up to you.

969
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:23,709
We'll be happy together from now on.

970
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,667
Breakfast is ready.

971
01:06:47,584 --> 01:06:50,834
If you don't like it, I'll make something else.

972
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:54,125
Thank you for cooking for me.

973
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:55,959
It's my duty.

974
01:06:56,334 --> 01:06:58,417
I'll go collect some firewood.

975
01:06:58,959 --> 01:07:00,376
No, I'll do it.

976
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:20,292
Greetings, Young Master.

977
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:36,501
Greetings, Young Master.

978
01:07:41,626 --> 01:07:42,876
Good morning, Young Master.

979
01:07:44,876 --> 01:07:47,043
These servants are very loyal to me.

980
01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:48,793
When they heard about our hermetic life,

981
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:50,376
they all came to join us.

982
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:14,500
Wang Chao.

983
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:17,750
You challenged the Supreme Sword Manor,
but you haven't fought yet.

984
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:20,834
I am tired of pointless massacres.

985
01:08:20,959 --> 01:08:22,876
Those are just winner-take-all games.

986
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,750
If everyone acts like you,
the martial world will fall apart.

987
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:27,542
Get your sword!

988
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:31,834
This is all I have.

989
01:08:34,751 --> 01:08:35,584
Dad.

990
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:38,500
It's fine. Go inside the house.

991
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:42,959
He is your only rival.

992
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:45,876
Kill him, then your father will be relieved.

993
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:50,043
He quit the martial world already. We should leave.

994
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,126
Draw your sword.

995
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:54,000
Don't force him to fight if he doesn't want to.

996
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:55,667
I should attend to my fields.

997
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:56,834
Goodbye.

998
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,084
Kill him.

999
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,209
Kill him.

1000
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:07,209
Kill him!

1001
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:14,168
Brother-in-law!

1002
01:09:24,084 --> 01:09:24,834
Stop fighting!

1003
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:28,834
Enough!

1004
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:29,501
Get out of here!

1005
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:45,875
It seems Third Master's sword
is useless against women.

1006
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:52,250
Bitch!

1007
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:53,834
How dare you harm my master?

1008
01:09:55,709 --> 01:09:57,126
You will die for this.

1009
01:09:58,709 --> 01:09:59,834
No!

1010
01:09:59,959 --> 01:10:01,459
Stop!

1011
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:07,584
Kill them all!

1012
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,375
It was right to kill his son.

1013
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:19,792
I didn't want that boy to spend his life in hatred.

1014
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:23,709
We can't lose what our ancestors earned for us.

1015
01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:28,751
The Manor-Pool marriage
was designed by our fathers.

1016
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,626
That young swordsman had left the martial world.

1017
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:33,251
He had a wife and children.

1018
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:35,918
That's exactly the life I yearn for.

1019
01:10:36,084 --> 01:10:38,334
Hsiao-feng, think.

1020
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:40,209
The Iron Blood Gate has been eradicated.

1021
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:43,042
The Purple Moon Valley will be taken soon.

1022
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:47,375
By then, the whole world will belong to us.

1023
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:49,792
How much glory awaits us?

1024
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:53,084
I wiped out everything he loved.

1025
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:56,543
His farm looked a lot like this one.

1026
01:11:00,751 --> 01:11:01,959
Hsiao-feng,

1027
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:03,376
you...

1028
01:11:04,334 --> 01:11:08,501
Do you know that the source of life is soil?

1029
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:11,459
Without soil,

1030
01:11:11,626 --> 01:11:14,959
we can't grow crops or trees.

1031
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:18,459
We can't live without it.

1032
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:20,709
What are you talking about?

1033
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:23,001
I want you to come down here

1034
01:11:23,126 --> 01:11:25,418
to experience real life.

1035
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:32,417
Come.

1036
01:11:45,876 --> 01:11:47,918
You're unhappy following me,

1037
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:50,126
and I'm unhappy following you.

1038
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:53,834
Why do you have to be so selfish,
demanding that I follow you?

1039
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:56,334
We can't change our family background.

1040
01:11:56,376 --> 01:11:57,918
The sun should shine high above in the sky...

1041
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:00,126
why must you drag it down to the mud?

1042
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:01,959
Stop this madness!

1043
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,668
Haven't I done everything to please him?

1044
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:24,209
Why does he still want to leave me?

1045
01:12:25,209 --> 01:12:27,084
There's no gain without loss.

1046
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:30,959
Other people and other affairs are waiting for you.

1047
01:12:31,334 --> 01:12:33,251
We'll eliminate the Supreme Sword Manor
as fast as we can...

1048
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:36,959
then the pain will disappear.

1049
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:44,250
Let's first eliminate the way of life he desires.

1050
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:50,334
As you command.

1051
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:53,501
My fields are here, I'm not leaving.

1052
01:12:53,626 --> 01:12:55,293
If you don't, she'll kill you.

1053
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:58,251
Have I offended her? Why would she?

1054
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:00,709
Because you love Chi!

1055
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:05,084
Pack your things. We'll leave at dawn.

1056
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:29,000
I won't demand that you love me,

1057
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:34,543
but can we at least act like lovers?

1058
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:37,917
Please?

1059
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:07,667
Run!

1060
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:16,959
Don't chase them.

1061
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:20,209
I heard that these bastards celebrated

1062
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:22,501
all night after Big Boss was killed.

1063
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,292
Burn it all.

1064
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:34,417
Fire!

1065
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:44,959
Stop here.

1066
01:14:45,084 --> 01:14:46,001
Quiet.

1067
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:51,084
Let's move.

1068
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,542
The rest of you stay close.

1069
01:14:52,834 --> 01:14:54,292
Follow me.

1070
01:14:55,376 --> 01:14:56,126
Hurry.

1071
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:00,292
After him.

1072
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:02,793
Stop!

1073
01:15:04,251 --> 01:15:05,209
What's wrong?

1074
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:06,668
My gold beads!

1075
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:09,126
Sweetie, where are you going?

1076
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:24,043
Why must you be so cruel to Chiu-ti?

1077
01:15:24,084 --> 01:15:25,751
You haunt her like a ghost,

1078
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:27,500
and me like a nightmare!

1079
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:28,667
Only after you die

1080
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:30,126
can I be at peace!

1081
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:34,084
Come on.

1082
01:15:54,334 --> 01:15:56,042
Is that the filthy lucre you earned
with your body?

1083
01:15:57,126 --> 01:15:58,959
That's how I supported my family.

1084
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:00,667
It's nobler than yours.

1085
01:16:01,209 --> 01:16:02,667
You're so greedy.

1086
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,500
No wonder you tried to seduce Hsiao-feng.

1087
01:16:05,751 --> 01:16:07,209
When I met him,

1088
01:16:07,251 --> 01:16:09,126
he was penniless.

1089
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:10,167
He cared for me.

1090
01:16:10,209 --> 01:16:11,792
He even willingly got stabbed for me.

1091
01:16:16,626 --> 01:16:17,626
Impossible!

1092
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:19,626
You still don't understand

1093
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,792
why he doesn't love you?

1094
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:22,917
It's because he knows

1095
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:24,834
you only love his status.

1096
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:27,626
But I love him as an ordinary man.

1097
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,918
You love him?

1098
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:34,584
Has he slept with you?

1099
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:39,000
Yes.

1100
01:16:40,876 --> 01:16:43,459
Hsiao-feng would never touch
a dirty whore like you!

1101
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:46,043
Such vulgar language from an aristocrat?

1102
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:47,376
No wonder he left you!

1103
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:51,876
Burn her to ashes.

1104
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:55,626
Sweetie!

1105
01:16:55,876 --> 01:16:56,376
Mom!

1106
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:57,750
Don't you dare touch her!

1107
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:03,292
Miao!

1108
01:17:07,626 --> 01:17:08,418
Mom!

1109
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:11,292
Mom!

1110
01:17:14,501 --> 01:17:15,668
Run!

1111
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:58,375
Sit down.

1112
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,334
Lean back your head.

1113
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:09,750
Where's Sweetie?

1114
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:21,293
Mom!

1115
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:24,667
If there's a next life, we'll be a family again.

1116
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:26,709
My dear daughter!

1117
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:30,834
Miao, we'll see each other in the next life!

1118
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:19,126
Save me!

1119
01:19:21,126 --> 01:19:22,293
Save me!

1120
01:19:25,459 --> 01:19:27,959
Save me!

1121
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:44,376
The Divine Might has taken the Purple Moon Valley.

1122
01:19:44,417 --> 01:19:46,875
Soon they'll attack the Supreme Sword Manor.

1123
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:50,584
Your father is in imminent danger. Don't you care?

1124
01:19:50,626 --> 01:19:54,584
He announced my death after I left home.

1125
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:00,001
To him, I'm already dead.

1126
01:20:01,459 --> 01:20:03,042
Divine Might killed Sweetie's whole family

1127
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:04,501
and massacred all the villagers.

1128
01:20:04,542 --> 01:20:07,000
Shouldn't you do something for them?

1129
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:10,001
Since I was 10,

1130
01:20:10,084 --> 01:20:14,001
I've been killing for my family's glory.

1131
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,084
My sword is besmeared with blood.

1132
01:20:16,126 --> 01:20:17,334
I am already full of iniquities.

1133
01:20:17,376 --> 01:20:19,418
How can I kill again?

1134
01:20:33,251 --> 01:20:34,418
There's no need to kill.

1135
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,001
We only need to defeat them.

1136
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:37,251
Understand, you fool?

1137
01:20:37,626 --> 01:20:39,584
Right. That's the truth!

1138
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,418
Swordsman Yen, well said!

1139
01:21:30,376 --> 01:21:31,043
Scout ahead.

1140
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:39,542
Hold your breath.

1141
01:22:33,126 --> 01:22:34,251
My lord!

1142
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:36,292
Their weapons are poisonous!

1143
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:37,543
In formation!

1144
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:03,751
Look out!

1145
01:23:04,001 --> 01:23:05,084
It's the suicide assassins!

1146
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,792
My lord, run!

1147
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:22,168
Elder Hsieh!

1148
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:23,667
Let's go.

1149
01:23:42,459 --> 01:23:43,876
Elder Hsieh...

1150
01:25:40,334 --> 01:25:41,834
Lord Hsieh,

1151
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:44,501
you murder your rivals in the name of justice

1152
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:46,084
in order to dominate the martial world.

1153
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:51,084
The Hsieh's true colours

1154
01:25:51,334 --> 01:25:53,376
are faker than our masks.

1155
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:54,792
Lord Hsieh,

1156
01:25:57,501 --> 01:25:58,668
what a pity.

1157
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:00,834
Chiu-ti.

1158
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:02,250
Let's do it.

1159
01:26:02,292 --> 01:26:09,250
Slay them, root and branch!

1160
01:26:15,209 --> 01:26:15,917
What are you doing?

1161
01:26:16,084 --> 01:26:17,209
I won't let them humiliate us!

1162
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:26,542
You're digging your own graves.

1163
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:27,751
After today,

1164
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:30,250
After today, the Hsieh Clan will be no more,

1165
01:26:30,292 --> 01:26:31,875
and I will rule supreme!

1166
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:38,875
Divine and demonic, all bow to my might!

1167
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:51,750
Lord Hsieh,

1168
01:26:52,542 --> 01:26:53,709
that was quite a lie you told me.

1169
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:56,501
Yen Shih-san, you stay out of this!

1170
01:27:25,376 --> 01:27:26,418
Chiu-ti...

1171
01:27:26,459 --> 01:27:27,917
you can still make things right.

1172
01:27:28,584 --> 01:27:29,876
No way!

1173
01:27:29,959 --> 01:27:31,001
Kill him!

1174
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:32,959
Kill him!

1175
01:28:02,084 --> 01:28:03,042
I'll kill you!

1176
01:28:19,709 --> 01:28:21,542
Hsiao-feng, your sword!

1177
01:28:34,584 --> 01:28:35,417
Ah Chi,

1178
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:37,959
if you can't help it,

1179
01:28:38,876 --> 01:28:41,168
chopping off a few fingers is alright, too.

1180
01:29:26,751 --> 01:29:28,084
Hsiao-feng,

1181
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:29,584
what are you looking at?

1182
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:31,959
Your clan put these brands on our faces!

1183
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,167
Kill me!

1184
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:39,792
Kill me, and I'll hunt you down in my next life!

1185
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,334
Fine.

1186
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:46,376
I'll pay my debt to you.

1187
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:53,792
Chu,

1188
01:29:54,292 --> 01:29:56,792
your men are dregs expelled by the Hsieh Clan.

1189
01:29:57,626 --> 01:29:58,709
Using them...

1190
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:01,167
is a disgrace to the Mu-yung Clan!

1191
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:03,084
I'll use anyone who can

1192
01:30:03,209 --> 01:30:04,501
help me make my name!

1193
01:30:05,709 --> 01:30:06,667
Chu,

1194
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:09,876
hatred will destroy you.

1195
01:30:42,209 --> 01:30:43,417
Don't hate me.

1196
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:35,000
Chiu-ti!

1197
01:31:36,459 --> 01:31:36,959
Calm down!

1198
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:40,542
<i>Mistress,</i>

1199
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:41,542
don't!

1200
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:05,251
I am already the Divine Might.

1201
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:07,834
Will you marry me?

1202
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:11,459
You're unworthy of me.

1203
01:32:12,626 --> 01:32:14,168
Then promise me...

1204
01:32:14,584 --> 01:32:16,084
you'll stop loving him.

1205
01:32:17,042 --> 01:32:20,084
He'll keep hurting you forever.

1206
01:32:29,834 --> 01:32:30,709
Chiu-ti!

1207
01:32:34,751 --> 01:32:35,876
You see?

1208
01:32:36,876 --> 01:32:38,584
You see how much he loves me?

1209
01:32:39,501 --> 01:32:41,168
Why don't you?

1210
01:32:41,209 --> 01:32:42,626
You can't love her.

1211
01:32:43,209 --> 01:32:44,626
She's mine.

1212
01:32:45,001 --> 01:32:46,543
She's mine!

1213
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:00,917
Hsiao-feng...

1214
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:04,376
would you marry me again?

1215
01:33:43,626 --> 01:33:45,709
I must be your wife.

1216
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:47,501
I must!

1217
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:51,667
Chiu-ti...

1218
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:53,250
don't hate me.

1219
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:57,042
Don't hate me!

1220
01:34:23,292 --> 01:34:24,584
It's late.

1221
01:34:24,876 --> 01:34:26,876
I've bought you the best liquor.

1222
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:28,917
You dress like a proper swordsman now.

1223
01:34:29,084 --> 01:34:30,876
It's time to return the favor.

1224
01:34:35,334 --> 01:34:35,792
Yen.

1225
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:36,792
Come on.

1226
01:34:37,251 --> 01:34:38,293
You can't defeat me.

1227
01:34:38,376 --> 01:34:39,959
Men lose to self-conceit.

1228
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:48,209
Let me show you.

1229
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,459
Forward thrust.

1230
01:35:24,084 --> 01:35:25,751
Upward thrust.

1231
01:35:36,042 --> 01:35:37,334
Thrust and twist.

1232
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:48,792
Circular slash.

1233
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:52,209
These are the most basic killing moves.

1234
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:53,751
Your 13-Sword Style

1235
01:35:54,042 --> 01:35:57,000
can only kill me if I err at my 7th move.

1236
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:12,418
A swordsman who knows his mistake but repeats it

1237
01:36:12,834 --> 01:36:14,209
deserves to die.

1238
01:36:15,251 --> 01:36:16,959
Let me see you off.

1239
01:36:49,376 --> 01:36:50,209
For a swordsman,

1240
01:36:50,459 --> 01:36:53,001
the most humiliating thing is
to die in pain on his sickbed.

1241
01:36:53,459 --> 01:36:54,167
Right?

1242
01:36:54,209 --> 01:36:54,751
Right.

1243
01:36:55,251 --> 01:36:56,459
How would you like to die?

1244
01:36:56,834 --> 01:36:58,376
Under a sword I respect.

1245
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:00,959
I would never humiliate a worthy opponent

1246
01:37:01,126 --> 01:37:03,001
by holding back.

1247
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:04,293
Very well.

1248
01:37:06,084 --> 01:37:08,501
We'll be friends in the next life.

1249
01:40:34,292 --> 01:40:36,042
He dug this grave himself.

1250
01:40:36,209 --> 01:40:38,459
You could say he died in the right place.

1251
01:40:40,084 --> 01:40:42,084
Let's exchange swords.

1252
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,251
Someone stole his name

1253
01:40:52,417 --> 01:40:54,000
so I'm returning it to him.

1254
01:41:07,709 --> 01:41:09,251
Where are we going?

1255
01:41:10,126 --> 01:41:12,709
We'll right the wrongs and fight for justice.

1256
01:41:12,751 --> 01:41:14,043
Will you kill people?

1257
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:18,501
I'll save them.
