1
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,414
<i>It's me, Peter Parker.</i>

2
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,434
<i>Your friendly neighborhood... you know.</i>

3
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:14,800
<i>I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider.</i>

4
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,481
<i>Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me.</i>

5
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:19,703
<i>Now...
- Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!</i>

6
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:22,491
<i>people really like me.</i>

7
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:27,347
Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes.
- Yeah... - That's OK.

8
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,665
<i>The city is safe and sound.</i>

9
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,163
<i>Guess I've had something to do with that.</i>

10
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,868
<i>My uncle Ben would be proud.</i>

11
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:42,492
<i>I still go to school,
top of my class.</i>

12
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:44,799
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us

13
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,041
that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field.

14
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:53,068
From the form of this matrix,

15
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,664
we can see...?

16
00:03:55,665 --> 00:04:00,759
Miss Stacey?
- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected.

17
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,847
Correct! Good work, Miss Stacey.

18
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:09,414
Parker.

19
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,431
You got something to add?

20
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:14,464
No, sir.

21
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:17,395
<i>And I'm in love</i>

22
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:20,616
<i>with the girl of my dreams.</i>

23
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:37,875
Hi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me?

24
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:41,097
Peter Parker.

25
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:44,751
Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.

26
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:18,982
It's my girlfriend!

27
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,949
Harry!

28
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:38,546
I need to talk to you.

29
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:42,105
Explain things.

30
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:44,123
Tell it to my father.

31
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:46,815
Raise him from the dead.

32
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:49,316
I'm your friend, Harry.

33
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:52,634
I cared about your father.

34
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:00,662
MJ.

35
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:02,872
Peter.

36
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,605
Was I good?
- Good?

37
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:07,681
You were great. You were...
- You say great?

38
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:09,700
I love my flowers. They're beautiful.

39
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,526
And those are from Harry.

40
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:15,276
Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

41
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:16,815
What's with you guys anyway?

42
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,354
It's complicated.

43
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,470
Tell me again, was I really good?

44
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,065
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

45
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,661
Your knees were fine.
- The applause was not very loud.

46
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,045
Yes, it was.

47
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:30,565
It's the acoustics.
It's all about diffusion.

48
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,490
It keeps the sound waves from grouping.

49
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:37,055
You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an...
- You are such a nerd.

50
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:28,978
Did you see that one?

51
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:39,506
You know what?

52
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:43,350
I'd like to sing on stage for the rest of my life

53
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:46,621
with you in the first row.

54
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:50,420
I'll be there.

55
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:54,267
Tell me you love me.

56
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:57,199
I love you.

57
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,468
I love you so much.

58
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:04,170
I always have.

59
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:43,157
You can't hide here, Flint.

60
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,793
I'm just here to see my daughter.

61
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:47,390
You are an escaped convict.

62
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,791
The cops are looking for you.

63
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,140
You're not getting near her.

64
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:54,216
You're nothing but a common thief.

65
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:56,041
You maybe even killed a man.

66
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:58,830
It wasn't even like that.

67
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,370
Wasn't.

68
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,774
I had good reason for what I was doing.

69
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,023
And that's the truth.

70
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:08,349
You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together.

71
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,331
I live in a prison. It's a great truth.

72
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:13,447
And that is the truth that you left behind.

73
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:17,629
Right there in that bedrooom.

74
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:34,213
I missed you.

75
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:38,111
I missed you too, Daddy.

76
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:48,831
I promise

77
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:50,849
I'll make you healthy again.

78
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,485
Whatever it takes.

79
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,751
I'll get the money.
- You get out of here.

80
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:59,263
Now.

81
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:11,136
I'm not a bad person.

82
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:14,839
Just had bad luck.

83
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:33,733
Peter, what is it?

84
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:36,041
It's MJ...

85
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,964
I'm gonna ask her to marry me!

86
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:41,330
Oh, Peter! Oh!

87
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,020
The day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him,

88
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:47,772
he was so scared and excited.

89
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:50,079
And very young.

90
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,867
And I loved him so fiercely.

91
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,406
Then you said yes, right?

92
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:57,674
No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

93
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:59,213
I wasn't ready,

94
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,366
neither was he.

95
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,963
So we took our time.

96
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,273
Looked forward to it.

97
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:10,174
Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love.

98
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,577
A man has to be understanding

99
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:16,714
and put his wife before himself.

100
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:20,512
Can you do that, Peter?

101
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:24,692
Yeah. I think I can.

102
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:28,348
Then you have my blessing.

103
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:32,001
I hope you've considered a proper proposal.

104
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:35,271
Your uncle had it all planned.

105
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:37,481
He took me to the beach one Sunday.

106
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:40,078
He was a knockout in his bathing suit.

107
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,290
And I, I didn't look too bad myself.

108
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,790
We were very good swimmers.

109
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,290
It was a beautiful day,

110
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,502
and he said: "Let's swim to the island."

111
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:51,714
And at the island,

112
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:54,405
we found a perfect spot by an old tree,

113
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:58,252
and we lay down and looked up at the sky.

114
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:01,904
And then he said, "Close your eyes, May."

115
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:04,309
And I did. And then he said, "Open them."

116
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,135
And I did.

117
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:10,173
And he was holding this ring.

118
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:15,033
Dazzling, in front of me.

119
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,646
I thought it was the sun.

120
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:24,118
We'd be married 50 years

121
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:28,109
come August... if...

122
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:36,135
So.

123
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,596
I hope you make it very special

124
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:42,095
for Mary Jane.

125
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:46,376
Do something she'll never forget.

126
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:51,232
Give her this.

127
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,577
Come on.

128
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:56,186
Take it.

129
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:12,049
Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

130
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:17,576
Listen to me! I didn't kill your father!

131
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,691
He was trying to kill me. He killed himself.

132
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:22,916
Shut up!

133
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:03,585
I'm still here, Peter!

134
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:28,681
Hate those things.

135
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:26,565
Harry.

136
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:30,202
Harry.

137
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:34,257
Harry!

138
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:40,604
Oh my God.

139
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:48,008
Harry!

140
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:51,565
Come on!

141
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:55,795
God!

142
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:01,900
200.
- And clear!

143
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:04,111
No response.
- Recharge. Let's go again.

144
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:06,804
Clear!

145
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:07,861
No response.

146
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:11,661
We charge it one more time. And clear!

147
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,535
Captain Stacey.

148
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:22,284
What's this?
- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide.

149
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,016
What about him?
- He just broke out of Rikers.

150
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,553
And?
- He's on the run.

151
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:29,738
He's in the marshlands. I think we got him.

152
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:35,411
There he is!

153
00:21:49,593 --> 00:21:51,802
"DANGER
PARTICLE PHYSICS TEST FACILITY
KEEP OUT"

154
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:55,891
*Euton*, take the west side. *Tommy*, take the east.

155
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:01,756
Where'd he go?

156
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,861
That's it. It's charged.
- Right.

157
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:25,073
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on 1.

158
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,707
There's a change in the silicon mass.

159
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,917
It's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up.

160
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,139
Initiating demoleculisation.

161
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,531
How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.

162
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:00,937
But there's been some memory impairment.

163
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:03,437
Particularly his short-term memory.

164
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:05,551
Right now, he can't remember the accident

165
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:07,571
or anything that happened to him recently.

166
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,821
Is it permanent?

167
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,360
It could be.

168
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,282
Only time will tell.

169
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,108
He's awake if you want to see him.

170
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,744
Uh-- maybe I should wait.

171
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:20,889
Nah, it's fine. Just keep it brief. Allow him to rest.

172
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:40,887
Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

173
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:42,954
Hit my head.

174
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:44,879
Yeah.

175
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,532
Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit and run.

176
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:52,762
I don't remember much of anything.

177
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:54,975
My father--

178
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:58,485
he died, right?

179
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,089
This is all so weird.

180
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,647
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

181
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:07,186
I know that face.

182
00:25:07,187 --> 00:25:08,470
How are you doing?

183
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:09,590
I don't know.

184
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,475
Last thing I remember, I was falling...

185
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,108
somewhere.

186
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:16,513
You're still fine.

187
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,724
We love you, Harry.

188
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,608
It feels like

189
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:26,465
somehow I've been gone for a really long time.

190
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,916
Now I'm back home.

191
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:32,089
It's good to have you back.

192
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:35,551
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, OK?

193
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:37,475
OK.
- All right, thank you.

194
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:39,107
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

195
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:43,197
Yeah, great.

196
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,532
I think he's gonna be fine.

197
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:49,779
Think so.

198
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,387
And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

199
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,897
You have lovely friends.

200
00:25:56,898 --> 00:26:00,887
My best friends.

201
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:05,697
I'd give my life for them.

202
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,213
Yeah?
- It's me.
- Oh! Hey!

203
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:12,663
You know I can't open the door.

204
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:14,779
It's stuck again?

205
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,988
Come on and help me.

206
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,212
I'm coming.

207
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:27,278
The review.
- Oh!

208
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,817
The hated it. They hated me.

209
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:30,354
Well, they can't hate you.

210
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:32,950
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl.

211
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:35,067
"Easy on the eyes, but not on the ears.

212
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:37,277
"Her small voice didn't carry past the first row."

213
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,392
That's ridiculous. I was right there.

214
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:41,124
You were in the first row.

215
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,238
Yeah, but that's...

216
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,682
Listen. You were great.

217
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,509
That's a critic.

218
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,009
This is something you're gonna have to get used to.

219
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,356
Believe me, I know.

220
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:54,296
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.
- This isn't about you.

221
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:55,450
It's about me.

222
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:57,471
It's about my career.
- I know, and I'm just saying,

223
00:29:57,472 --> 00:30:00,356
you can't let it bring you down.

224
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:02,757
You just gotta believe in yourself.
You pull yourself together,

225
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:06,124
and you get right back on the horse.
- Don't give me the horse thing.

226
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:10,021
Try to understand how I feel.

227
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:17,423
It's just...

228
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:20,450
I look at these words,

229
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:24,635
and it's like my father wrote them.

230
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:32,231
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution.

231
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:37,615
Go get 'em, tiger.

232
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:40,979
Sorry.

233
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:12,371
Oh my God.

234
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,968
Seven *Atom* to central. That crane *****.

235
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:21,363
It's bigger than we thought. We're gonna need a major mobilization right away.

236
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,440
Just gotta *douse the accelerator! Now!

237
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:38,190
OK, Gwen.
I've got a secret. It's my call for ya.

238
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,902
What is that thing doing in my background?

239
00:32:05,738 --> 00:32:07,468
Captain Stacey, the guys look *out of shot of it*.
They can't shut down the crane.

240
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,679
Get Edison on the phone.

241
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,767
Have them kill the power of the whole block.

242
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:17,133
Are you all right?

243
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:18,096
It's coming back!

244
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:45,159
Oh my God. It's Gwen!

245
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,863
What?

246
00:32:51,412 --> 00:32:52,660
What's she doing up there?

247
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:55,256
I don't know. I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig.

248
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:57,178
Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir.

249
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:58,622
Eddie Brock, jr.

250
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:01,025
I work at the Daily Bugle.

251
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,824
And I'm dating your daughter.

252
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:58,620
You OK?
- Yeah.

253
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,735
I'm fine.

254
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:01,987
Thank you.

255
00:34:01,987 --> 00:34:04,197
Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo.

256
00:34:04,198 --> 00:34:06,217
Thank God you're OK.
- Daddy!

257
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:11,987
Hey. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?

258
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:15,062
From now on, I'm gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle.

259
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,755
So-- smile! Are you smiling?

260
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,160
Where's the other guy?
- Peter Parker?

261
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,139
Yeah, um, look, between you and me--

262
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,062
The guy's kind of an amateur.

263
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,044
Have you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated.

264
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:31,651
Just a little chunky.
- OK...

265
00:34:32,276 --> 00:34:36,265
Don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy.

266
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:46,650
Dazzeling.

267
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,813
Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up.

268
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:56,699
As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good.

269
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,909
Though not as good as the New York Times

270
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,347
or the Daily News

271
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:03,620
or the Post or several other smaller...
- Get on with it, moron!

272
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,217
What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson.

273
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:10,878
Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

274
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,303
Thank you.

275
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,139
So, I propose this campaign:

276
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,831
"DAILY BUGLE" -- that's obvious.

277
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:25,061
"IT'S HIP, IT'S NOW" -- I came up with that one.

278
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:30,157
"IT'S WOW" -- that's actually Eric's.

279
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:33,427
"AND HOW!" -- that's me again.

280
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:36,311
Time to take your pill.

281
00:35:36,312 --> 00:35:37,753
Not that one.

282
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:41,841
Not that one.

283
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,457
Drink plenty of water.

284
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:57,130
Thank you.

285
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,975
Continue.

286
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,485
He's busy.

287
00:36:04,486 --> 00:36:05,925
Oh, no, I'm just here to talk to you, babe.
(- What's that smell?)

288
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:07,466
That's a little something called

289
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,388
"Nice 'n' Easy".

290
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:11,024
What's on you?
- It's called "Go Away".

291
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:15,350
That is the dumbest idea you've ever had. You have had some daunting...
- Blood pressure.

292
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:18,618
Hey, where are you going?

293
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,349
Who are you?
- You hired him last week.

294
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,274
Freelance.
- I did? What's that smell?

295
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:23,908
Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.

296
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,216
Wow, I really like that shirt.

297
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,234
Here. It's a crane accident. Check out the light source.

298
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:29,677
He likes my shirt.

299
00:36:29,678 --> 00:36:31,694
Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete. You better get in there.

300
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:36,553
A new guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.

301
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:38,908
Uh. Thanks.

302
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:41,503
Parker! You're late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it.

303
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:44,098
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
- I got you this.

304
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,734
But he got me this.

305
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,850
Wait. How'd you get that? I didn't see you.
- How'd you get that high?

306
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:50,157
Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.

307
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:51,984
A flagpole?

308
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,907
Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

309
00:36:53,908 --> 00:36:55,349
It's better.
- Cheaper, too.

310
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,041
Congratulations, son. We'll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks.

311
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,772
Uh-- all right, JJ. I'm your man.

312
00:36:59,773 --> 00:37:01,214
I know more about what makes a good picture

313
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:04,677
than any photographer in this town.
See, photography, it's not just about

314
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:06,023
-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever.

315
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:09,097
It's about lighting. Composition. Drama.

316
00:37:09,098 --> 00:37:11,790
I want a staff job, sir.

317
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,907
I have a girl that I intend to marry, and--

318
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:20,637
I have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time.

319
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:23,860
J. Jonah Jameson.

320
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:26,791
Well, we do have an opening.

321
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,906
Johnson quit, remember?
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

322
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:31,214
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture,

323
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,136
and I've been here for a long time. If there's a staff job,

324
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:35,541
Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it.

325
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,174
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years.

326
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,520
He's done a great job.

327
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,350
You want a staff job, and you want a staff job.

328
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:42,273
Anybody care about what I want?

329
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:43,810
I do.
- Shut up. Get out.

330
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:47,462
I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is.

331
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,387
He's a fake. He's full of stickum.

332
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:51,599
Catch him in the act.

333
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,810
"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar".

334
00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:55,829
Whoever brings me that photo gets the job.

335
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,137
What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go!

336
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:00,828
I'm on it, boss.

337
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:02,367
You'll never get that shot.

338
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:05,396
We'll see.

339
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:18,426
You know,

340
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:23,667
I guess one person can make a difference.

341
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:27,225
'Nuff said.

342
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:34,002
Welcome home, Harry.

343
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,925
Thank God you're all right.

344
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:37,271
Thanks, Bernard.

345
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:40,686
Aperitif?
- Sure.

346
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,866
Got you a little homecoming present.

347
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,694
Wha-- It's your old ball!
- Yeah.

348
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:48,424
Thanks, buddy.

349
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,540
We were pretty good in the backyard, weren't we?

350
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:54,000
We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team.

351
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,925
Yeah, for the cheerleaders.
- Right.

352
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:57,944
Hey, do I have any girlfriends?

353
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:01,310
I don't know.
- You don't?

354
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:07,030
Hey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends?
- Not that I know of, sir.

355
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,271
That's a pretty cool pass, huh?

356
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:14,481
It's OK.

357
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:15,828
Looks like I'm not worrying for money.

358
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:17,365
No.

359
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:22,128
Well, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around.

360
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:29,289
You know,

361
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:33,327
he always appreciated how you helped me through high school.

362
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:37,800
I just wish I could remember more about him.

363
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,053
He loved you.

364
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:42,461
That's the main thing.

365
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:45,347
Hey, let's watch the game in the kitchen.

366
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:48,376
Get something to eat.
- OK.

367
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:51,645
Whoa, catch that!

368
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,768
Did you see that?

369
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,308
Still got the moves.

370
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:59,337
Yeah!

371
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:32,799
Why are you stopping?

372
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:37,896
What is she doing here?
Gary, you were supposed to call her agent.

373
00:40:40,058 --> 00:40:41,309
Hi, honey.

374
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,654
We tried to reach you.

375
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:43,808
I'm sorry.

376
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:47,461
One critic?
- No, all the papers, dear.

377
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:54,145
Mary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let's explain it to you.
- If you like, we could say you became ill.

378
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:07,318
That was so poorly handled.
- Yeah. Let's just rehearse.

379
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:16,260
All right, Spidey!

380
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:59,769
Excuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile.

381
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,884
Hi, Eddie.

382
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:03,132
You're so beautiful.

383
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:04,769
This is front page stuff.

384
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,499
I've got to practice. I'll see you later, OK?

385
00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:08,229
How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

386
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,961
Why not?

387
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:14,286
Think of that amazing-- night that we had.

388
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:17,554
We had a coffee, Eddie.

389
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:19,864
Hey, beautiful.

390
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:22,990
One more.

391
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,595
Everything OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

392
00:42:26,595 --> 00:42:28,228
You're not still mad at me, are you?

393
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:30,632
No, Peter. I'm proud of you.

394
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,845
Hey. I'm gonna be swingin' it from over there.

395
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:37,171
So you know where to look.

396
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:39,094
Give 'em a good show.

397
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:40,632
Don't worry about that review.

398
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:42,364
We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night.

399
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:45,779
Promise.
- Yeah.

400
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:03,807
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?

401
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:04,962
He fits.

402
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:09,529
Hey you! Halt!

403
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,847
Cover the back!

404
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:21,162
Fire!

405
00:44:42,651 --> 00:44:45,247
People of the city of New York, I am here today

406
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:47,458
because I fell 62 storeys

407
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,190
and someone caught me.

408
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:54,525
Someone who never asks for anything in return.

409
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:55,488
Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.

410
00:44:56,114 --> 00:45:00,056
Hey, MJ.
- Harry.

411
00:45:00,057 --> 00:45:02,170
Where is Pete?

412
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:04,189
Um-- taking somebody's picture, I guess.

413
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,496
I'm so happy to see you. You look so good.

414
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,133
I've never felt better.

415
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:10,632
It's a weird feeling, not knowing New York.

416
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:14,284
Bump on the head, I'm just free as a bird.

417
00:45:14,285 --> 00:45:17,699
Will you bump me on the head?
- Bop.

418
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,535
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

419
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:23,130
You came. You sent me flowers.

420
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,478
I did?

421
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:25,919
I'll come again tonight.

422
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,459
You can't.

423
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,803
I--I was let go.

424
00:45:28,805 --> 00:45:31,978
What happened.

425
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,630
I wasn't very good.

426
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,554
You know, this is embarrassing, but...

427
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:39,284
I once wrote you a play in high school.

428
00:45:39,285 --> 00:45:40,823
You wrote me a play?

429
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:44,670
Yeah.
- Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

430
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,594
I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute

431
00:45:46,594 --> 00:45:48,227
or your store's being robbed

432
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:50,053
or your house is on fire,

433
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:55,630
who is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children?

434
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:57,650
Spider-Man!

435
00:45:57,651 --> 00:45:58,996
They love me!

436
00:45:58,996 --> 00:46:04,187
Then let's hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood...

437
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:07,891
Spider-Man!

438
00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:38,228
Kiss him!
Kiss him!

439
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,765
Go ahead, lay it right on me.

440
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:42,648
Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

441
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:45,149
Kiss him! Kiss him!
- No, Spider-Man, no!

442
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,274
Right...

443
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:58,852
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

444
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:07,793
Hey, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

445
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,820
Jig's up, pal.

446
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:17,168
I don't want to hurt you.

447
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:19,765
Leave now.
- I guess you haven't heard?

448
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:21,784
I'm the sheriff 'round these parts.

449
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:24,907
OK.

450
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:38,369
Where do all these guys come from?

451
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,318
Bonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un "reservation"?

452
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,754
I'm sorry, I don't speak...
- But this is a French restaurant, non?

453
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:34,715
Oui.

454
00:50:35,723 --> 00:50:40,387
Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

455
00:50:42,551 --> 00:50:43,896
Ah. Here we are.

456
00:50:43,897 --> 00:50:46,973
Table for two. Pekar.

457
00:50:46,974 --> 00:50:49,377
Parker.
- That is what I said.

458
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:52,984
Pekar.

459
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:55,049
Um, I have a request.

460
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,741
My girlfriend will be coming,

461
00:50:57,742 --> 00:51:01,733
and I have this ring.

462
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,012
Ah. Allô.

463
00:51:06,013 --> 00:51:08,991
Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein?

464
00:51:08,992 --> 00:51:11,972
Yes, and I want to do something very special.

465
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:13,221
I love it.

466
00:51:13,222 --> 00:51:14,472
Romance.

467
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:18,080
I am French.

468
00:51:18,128 --> 00:51:21,395
When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring...

469
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:22,741
In ze bottom of her glass?

470
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:24,857
Perfect.
- Magnifique.

471
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:27,261
Also I thought, at the same time

472
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:28,608
could the musicians

473
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:31,589
play this song?

474
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,799
Their favorite.

475
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,177
And take good care of the ring.

476
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,951
Ah oui, with my life, monsieur.

477
00:51:39,814 --> 00:51:41,381
- S'il vous plaît.
- Oui.

478
00:51:41,672 --> 00:51:45,658
I like you.

479
00:51:46,091 --> 00:51:47,161
Thank you.

480
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:49,552
"Bon" chance.

481
00:51:52,749 --> 00:51:53,816
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

482
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:05,926
OK, so... How would you like some champagne?

483
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,200
How'd that get in there?

484
00:52:10,201 --> 00:52:15,052
Aw, don't cry.

485
00:52:19,423 --> 00:52:24,754
Look at you, wow! Beautiful.
- Thanks.

486
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:29,507
Is this place in your budget?

487
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:31,333
Oh, it's a special occasion.

488
00:52:31,334 --> 00:52:34,215
You're on Broadway.

489
00:52:34,215 --> 00:52:36,328
I don't feel like much of a star tonight.

490
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:37,769
Well, you are a star.

491
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:42,332
And you've earned it.

492
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:44,682
Peter, you have no idea how I feel right now.

493
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:48,142
Oh no, I know exactly how you feel.

494
00:52:48,143 --> 00:52:48,910
Listen.

495
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:50,447
I have been through this.

496
00:52:50,448 --> 00:52:51,985
Happens to me all the time.

497
00:52:51,986 --> 00:52:54,865
I see Spider-Man posters in the window.

498
00:52:54,866 --> 00:52:56,883
Kids running around with me on their sweaters.

499
00:52:56,884 --> 00:52:58,516
Big Hallowe'en item.

500
00:52:58,517 --> 00:53:01,110
I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon.

501
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,840
Like yesterday.

502
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:06,776
They keep screaming: "Spider-Man! Spider-Man!"

503
00:53:06,777 --> 00:53:08,506
I don't know, I mean,

504
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:10,332
I'm thinking to myself,

505
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:16,286
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?"

506
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:21,523
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

507
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:29,254
Hi. My parents and I are just having dinner here.

508
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:30,215
Hello.

509
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:31,943
I'm Gwen Stacey.

510
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:35,594
This is Mary Jane Watson.

511
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:41,357
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time.

512
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,200
Gwen is my lab partner in Dr Connor's class.

513
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:48,177
Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him.

514
00:53:48,178 --> 00:53:50,388
Which actually reminds me--

515
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:53,942
Pete, if you got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man,

516
00:53:53,943 --> 00:53:55,767
could you bring it to class?

517
00:53:55,768 --> 00:53:57,592
I'd really love it.

518
00:53:57,593 --> 00:54:00,186
For my portfolio.

519
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:03,644
After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?

520
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:06,525
I can't imagine.

521
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:10,174
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

522
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,932
Good night.
- Good night.

523
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:28,810
Uh, she's in my science class. It's not her best subject.

524
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:29,963
What?

525
00:54:29,964 --> 00:54:33,325
How come you never mentioned her?

526
00:54:33,326 --> 00:54:35,727
She's your lab partner,

527
00:54:35,728 --> 00:54:37,935
you saved her life,

528
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:42,739
she thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you?

529
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,814
Or didn't you notice?

530
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:49,943
And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city.

531
00:54:49,944 --> 00:54:54,316
I'll never forget that.

532
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,877
She's just a girl in my class.
- Let me ask you something.

533
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,893
When you kissed her,

534
00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:03,295
who was kissing her?

535
00:55:03,296 --> 00:55:06,082
Spider-Man or Peter?

536
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,057
What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

537
00:55:09,058 --> 00:55:11,459
That was our kiss.

538
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,861
Why would you do that?

539
00:55:13,862 --> 00:55:16,936
You must have known how it made me feel.

540
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,953
Do you want to push me away?

541
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:20,874
Push you away?

542
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,659
Why would I want to push you away? I love you.

543
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:28,749
You're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, MJ.

544
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:33,552
I don't feel very well. I'm sorry. I have to go.

545
00:55:33,553 --> 00:55:38,405
Where are you going?
- Please don't follow me.

546
00:55:39,413 --> 00:55:43,977
Here we are.

547
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:20,236
<i>Hi, it's MJ. Sing a song at the beep. Beep!</i>

548
00:56:20,237 --> 00:56:24,175
Hello. Uh...

549
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:26,001
I wish you'd pick up the phone.

550
00:56:26,002 --> 00:56:28,401
I don't know what's going on.

551
00:56:28,402 --> 00:56:31,475
<i>I don't know if you got the messages, or what.</i>

552
00:56:31,476 --> 00:56:33,589
<i>But...</i>

553
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,431
<i>I just want to talk to you.</i>

554
00:56:37,432 --> 00:56:42,476
OK. Call me, all right?

555
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:52,127
Hallo?
- Mr Parker?

556
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:54,626
Yeah?
- This is Detective Neil Garettfrom the 2nd precinct.

557
00:56:54,627 --> 00:56:57,892
I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacey.

558
00:56:57,893 --> 00:56:59,908
He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him.

559
00:56:59,909 --> 00:57:02,597
Originally we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine,

560
00:57:02,598 --> 00:57:05,769
was your husband's killer.

561
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,072
We were wrong.

562
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:11,918
What?
- Turns out Mr Carradine was only an accomplice.

563
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:14,414
The actual killer is still at large.

564
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:16,046
What are you talking about?

565
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:21,476
This is the man who killed your husband.

566
00:57:23,154 --> 00:57:27,476
His name is Flint Marko.
He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison.

567
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:28,822
You got this wrong.

568
00:57:28,823 --> 00:57:31,223
Two days ago, he escaped.

569
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:33,625
Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate.

570
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:39,534
And we have a couple of witnesses who corroborate the story.

571
00:57:49,379 --> 00:57:54,134
No, wait, sir. You don't want to do this.

572
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:10,079
Get in! What are you doing?

573
00:58:25,304 --> 00:58:26,937
Would you put these photos away, please?

574
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:29,915
I'm sorry, Mrs Parker. I know this isn't easy,

575
00:58:29,915 --> 00:58:31,932
but please be patient with us.

576
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:34,141
We're doing our job. We will catch him.

577
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:35,485
No, you're not doing your job.

578
00:58:35,486 --> 00:58:36,926
I watched my uncle die.

579
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,368
We chased down the wrong man.

580
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:41,154
Now you're telling me there's suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

581
00:58:41,155 --> 00:58:44,323
Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down, sir.

582
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:46,723
No, I have no intention of settling down!
This man killed my uncle,

583
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:51,000
and he's still out there!

584
00:58:57,003 --> 00:59:01,421
L-20 Parkway, all officers in the vicinity please report.

585
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:07,427
We have an abandoned vehicle and an abandoned man in the middle of the street.

586
00:59:07,428 --> 00:59:08,386
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

587
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:13,141
Peter, it's MJ.

588
00:59:13,142 --> 00:59:18,953
I'm not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up.

589
00:59:23,419 --> 00:59:25,821
Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened.

590
00:59:25,822 --> 00:59:27,933
She's worried about you.

591
00:59:27,934 --> 00:59:29,373
I'm worried about you.

592
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:31,774
Don't be. I'm fine.

593
00:59:31,775 --> 00:59:33,600
I don't want you to do something stupid.

594
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:36,290
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

595
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:38,691
And do something you'll regret.

596
00:59:38,692 --> 00:59:40,419
Like...

597
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,765
with that other guy.

598
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:43,302
He had a gun on me.

599
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:46,855
I made a move, and he fell. I told you that.
- I'm not accusing you of anything.

600
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:52,764
<i>C-22, auto at 566, 9th Avenue...
- Will you turn that thing off?</i>

601
00:59:57,425 --> 01:00:00,785
Peter, I'm here because I care about you.

602
01:00:00,786 --> 01:00:06,163
And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but--

603
01:00:06,164 --> 01:00:09,239
I want to be here for you.
- OK.

604
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,160
I get it. Thank you.

605
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,658
But, uh, I'm fine.

606
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:17,740
I don't need your help.

607
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,470
Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.

608
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:29,843
Even Spider-Man.

609
01:00:35,656 --> 01:00:37,444
<i>90 - X-ray - 98.</i>

610
01:00:40,118 --> 01:00:43,681

<i>1-3-Tom has responded 10-20 at 540, East 107...</i>

614
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:00,264
Don't hurt me! Just give me a chance!
- What about my uncle?

615
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:01,716
Did you give him a chance?

616
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:04,717
Did you?

617
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:18,361
Where am I?

618
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,875
What is this?

619
01:02:36,456 --> 01:02:39,456
I feel...

620
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:42,358
Wow.

621
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:45,359
This feels good.

622
01:03:13,808 --> 01:03:16,808
This is something else.

623
01:03:17,388 --> 01:03:18,355
What do you think?

624
01:03:18,355 --> 01:03:20,774
I've never seen anything like it.

625
01:03:20,775 --> 01:03:23,483
I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but...

626
01:03:23,484 --> 01:03:26,484
I'll look at it in the morning, run some tests.
- Can we do that now?

627
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,516
<i>It seems to like you.</i>

628
01:03:36,064 --> 01:03:38,580
Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

629
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,999
It has the characteristics of a symbiote,

630
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:43,999
which needs to bond to a host to survive.

631
01:03:44,484 --> 01:03:47,484
And sometimes, these things in nature, when they bind,

632
01:03:48,354 --> 01:03:51,354
they can be hard to unbind.

633
01:03:51,935 --> 01:03:54,935
<i>Bank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank *** Bismarck.</i>

634
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:58,417
<i>Another sand storm is reported in the vicinity. All cars, proceed with caution.</i>

635
01:03:58,873 --> 01:04:01,873
Marko.

636
01:04:53,752 --> 01:04:56,075
Buddy, love the new outfit.

637
01:04:56,076 --> 01:04:59,076
This is exactly what I need to scoop, partner. Give me some of that web action.

638
01:05:01,206 --> 01:05:04,206
See you, chum.

639
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:07,399
What the hell?

640
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:50,180
Flint Marko?

641
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:52,309
What do you want from me?

642
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:54,632
Remember Ben Parker?

643
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:57,633
The old man you shot down in cold blood?

644
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,989
What does it matter to you anyway?

645
01:06:02,473 --> 01:06:05,473
Everything!

646
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,318
It's time to pay, Marko.

647
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,970
Good riddance.

648
01:08:10,482 --> 01:08:11,524
Re-ent!

649
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:12,498
Not now.

650
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:15,499
This is a free country. It's not a rent-free country.

651
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:17,333
Leave me alone.

652
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:18,259
Give me rent.

653
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,260
You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!

654
01:08:32,666 --> 01:08:34,237
That wasn't cool.

655
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,238
He is good boy.

656
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:43,541
He must be in some kind of trouble.

657
01:09:28,656 --> 01:09:31,536
Flint Marko, the man who killed uncle Ben--

658
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:34,418
he was killed last night.

659
01:09:34,419 --> 01:09:37,107
O my--

660
01:09:37,108 --> 01:09:38,067
What happened?

661
01:09:38,068 --> 01:09:41,068
Spider-Man killed him.

662
01:09:41,622 --> 01:09:42,710
Spider-Man?

663
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,655
I don't understand.

664
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:48,656
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

665
01:09:50,456 --> 01:09:53,456
What happened?

666
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:02,099
I... He was...

667
01:10:04,863 --> 01:10:07,863
I thought that you'd feel...

668
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:12,255
He deserved it, didn't he?

669
01:10:12,256 --> 01:10:15,256
I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die.

670
01:10:18,307 --> 01:10:21,307
Aunt May, he killed uncle Ben.

671
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:24,549
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

672
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:27,550
But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts.

673
01:10:31,944 --> 01:10:34,944
It's like a poison.

674
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:38,114
It can take you over.

675
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:41,355
Before you know it,

676
01:10:41,356 --> 01:10:44,356
turn us into something ugly.

677
01:11:42,628 --> 01:11:44,067
Hello.

678
01:11:44,068 --> 01:11:46,083
Hey, Harry, it's MJ.

679
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:48,388
Hi.
- I need some company.

680
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,983
Are you doing anything? Can I stop by?

681
01:11:50,984 --> 01:11:52,902
Yeah, sure. Come on over.

682
01:11:52,903 --> 01:11:55,111
OK. Are you sure it's OK?

683
01:11:55,112 --> 01:11:57,032
I'm not doing anything.

684
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:58,185
Please, come over.

685
01:11:58,187 --> 01:11:59,337
OK, I'll see you soon.

686
01:11:59,338 --> 01:12:02,338
Great.
- Bye.

687
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,291
Bernard?
- Yes, Mr Osborn?

688
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,692
We're having a guest. Can you get some food?

689
01:12:07,692 --> 01:12:10,573
A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

690
01:12:10,574 --> 01:12:11,820
A guest guest?

691
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:13,358
Will you just get some food?

692
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:16,359
Rightaway, sir.

693
01:12:32,278 --> 01:12:34,486
Hey, Mr Ditkovitch.

694
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:36,119
An orange?

695
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:37,176
No, thanks.

696
01:12:37,176 --> 01:12:38,808
Listen--

697
01:12:38,808 --> 01:12:41,112
I'm really sorry for what happened earlier.

698
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:44,113
I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about.

699
01:12:44,188 --> 01:12:46,780
Ah, it's not big deal.

700
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,603
But if you feel that bad about it,

701
01:12:48,604 --> 01:12:50,908
you can buy me pizza some time.

702
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:52,733
Today's good.

703
01:12:52,734 --> 01:12:53,694
OK.

704
01:12:53,695 --> 01:12:54,942
Have problem with the phone?

705
01:12:54,943 --> 01:12:57,943
No, no, I was just-- was trying to figure out what to say.

706
01:12:58,592 --> 01:13:00,992
If it's a woman you're calling,

707
01:13:00,993 --> 01:13:03,776
then you say: "You're a good woman,

708
01:13:03,777 --> 01:13:06,777
"I'm good man."

709
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:12,613
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

710
01:13:12,614 --> 01:13:15,111
He's calling a woman.
- Are you calling Mary Jane?

711
01:13:15,111 --> 01:13:17,702
I think that would be so good...
- It's none of your business.

712
01:13:17,703 --> 01:13:20,703
Go! Go.

713
01:13:21,354 --> 01:13:24,354
Give her a call.
- Thanks.

714
01:13:26,346 --> 01:13:29,346
Bye.
- Bye.

715
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:47,474
You hungry?

716
01:13:47,474 --> 01:13:49,010
Yeah.

717
01:13:49,011 --> 01:13:52,011
Come in.

718
01:13:54,678 --> 01:13:57,678
Hope you like peppers.

719
01:14:19,839 --> 01:14:22,839
I love 'em.

720
01:14:32,613 --> 01:14:35,613
Oh, the butter!

721
01:14:58,639 --> 01:15:01,639
Well, we can use that part.

722
01:15:02,191 --> 01:15:04,494
"You've been dreaming."

723
01:15:04,495 --> 01:15:07,495
"Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night."

724
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:10,545
All right.
- When did you write that?

725
01:15:10,546 --> 01:15:13,234
12th grade.
- It's intense.

726
01:15:13,235 --> 01:15:15,347
So, do you want the part?

727
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:18,349
I'd love to be in your play.
- Cheers.

728
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:23,437
You know, there's not even a scar.

729
01:15:25,048 --> 01:15:28,048
Barely.

730
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,312
Sorry.
- Me too.

731
01:15:45,313 --> 01:15:48,095
I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's OK. Please.

732
01:15:48,096 --> 01:15:50,208
Forgive me.

733
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:53,186
Mary Jane.

734
01:15:53,187 --> 01:15:55,491
Mary Jane.

735
01:15:55,492 --> 01:15:58,492
Mary Jane, please!
- I'm sorry.

736
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:14,434
You've taken your eye off the ball.

737
01:16:34,578 --> 01:16:37,578
What have you done?

738
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,334
Avenge me!

739
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:46,030
My father-- he died, right?

740
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:47,158
Yeah.

741
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:49,079
Just wish that I could remember more about him.

742
01:16:49,081 --> 01:16:50,424
Well, he loved you.

743
01:16:50,425 --> 01:16:52,058
That's the main thing.

744
01:16:52,058 --> 01:16:55,058
<i>I swear on my father's grave: Spider-Man will pay.</i>

745
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:59,090
Harry.

746
01:16:59,357 --> 01:17:02,357
Remember me?

747
01:17:03,102 --> 01:17:05,021
Yes, father.

748
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:05,981
I remember.

749
01:17:05,982 --> 01:17:07,616
I was right about her,

750
01:17:07,617 --> 01:17:09,056
about Peter,

751
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:12,057
about everything.

752
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:15,202
<i>You know what you must do.</i>

753
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:18,203
<i>Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead.</i>

754
01:17:18,563 --> 01:17:21,563
<i>First we attack his heart.</i>

755
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:35,561
<i>Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

756
01:17:35,562 --> 01:17:36,618
Hey, MJ.

757
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:39,619
It's Peter.

758
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:43,171
I want to talk to you about last night.

759
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,742
I don't know what I was thinking.

760
01:17:45,743 --> 01:17:48,238
I know you were just there to help, and--

761
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:51,239
I, uh-- I don't know, I want to see you.

762
01:17:57,746 --> 01:17:59,571
If you want Peter to live,

763
01:17:59,572 --> 01:18:02,572
you're gonna do something for me.

764
01:18:05,525 --> 01:18:06,966
Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

765
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:09,967
Come in.

766
01:18:17,051 --> 01:18:19,162
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

767
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:22,162
There's a phone call for you.

768
01:18:22,524 --> 01:18:24,155
It's Mary Jane, she called back!

769
01:18:24,156 --> 01:18:27,156
Really?
- Yeah!

770
01:18:27,806 --> 01:18:29,918
I put the phone on top of the thing.

771
01:18:29,919 --> 01:18:32,919
Thanks. OK.

772
01:18:35,242 --> 01:18:36,453
Hey.
- Hi.

773
01:18:36,486 --> 01:18:38,177
I was so glad you called.

774
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:41,155
I've been-- trying to--
- Can you meet me?

775
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:43,364
You bet.
- Now?

776
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:44,709
OK. Where?

777
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:46,629
At the bridge, in the park.

778
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:48,164
On my way.

779
01:18:48,165 --> 01:18:51,165
Hey. I love you.

780
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:12,581
You look beautiful.

781
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:14,625
Peonies.

782
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:17,936
You OK?

783
01:19:17,937 --> 01:19:19,953
No.

784
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:22,954
There's something I have to tell you, Pete.
- OK.

785
01:19:24,948 --> 01:19:27,731
It's not working.

786
01:19:27,732 --> 01:19:30,327
You and me.

787
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:32,055
What?

788
01:19:32,056 --> 01:19:34,934
I don't want to see you anymore.

789
01:19:34,935 --> 01:19:36,759
What are you talking about?

790
01:19:36,759 --> 01:19:39,759
I don't know.

791
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:44,274
I'm lonely.
You aren't there for me.

792
01:19:47,229 --> 01:19:50,108
I can't do this.

793
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:51,933
It's over.
- No. Please.

794
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:54,934
Please don't say that.

795
01:19:55,775 --> 01:19:57,504
I know, I've been selfish.

796
01:19:57,505 --> 01:20:00,000
But I can do better. I can change.
- It's not that simple.

797
01:20:00,002 --> 01:20:02,402
We love each other! I love you!

798
01:20:02,403 --> 01:20:04,322
And we have problems. When people have problems, they work it out.

799
01:20:04,323 --> 01:20:07,323
They talk to each other.

800
01:20:12,294 --> 01:20:14,887
Look, you see?

801
01:20:14,888 --> 01:20:17,888
You know what this is?

802
01:20:18,057 --> 01:20:21,057
You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.

803
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:24,225
I've fallen in love with someone else.

804
01:20:55,895 --> 01:20:57,527
She says that she's lonely,

805
01:20:57,527 --> 01:21:00,527
and that I'm not there for her.

806
01:21:01,369 --> 01:21:04,369
There's another guy.

807
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,954
How are you holding up?

808
01:21:08,955 --> 01:21:11,955
Not good.

809
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:15,510
Harry, I was going to propose to her.

810
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:18,967
Really?

811
01:21:19,615 --> 01:21:22,207
She's been going through a tough time lately.

812
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,360
Career.

813
01:21:23,361 --> 01:21:26,242
I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club--

814
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:29,243
that's not exactly what she had in mind for herself.

815
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:32,410
A singing waitress? What are you talking about?

816
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:35,364
She was fired from the show.

817
01:21:35,365 --> 01:21:37,285
Didn't she tell you?

818
01:21:37,286 --> 01:21:40,167
She was fired?

819
01:21:40,168 --> 01:21:43,144
She was fired and she told you?

820
01:21:43,145 --> 01:21:46,145
She didn't tell me?

821
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,698
That's why I asked you here, Pete.

822
01:21:50,348 --> 01:21:53,348
I'm the other guy.

823
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:55,821
What?

824
01:21:55,822 --> 01:21:58,822
Look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled.

825
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:01,894
She needed someone, and I was there for her.

826
01:22:02,353 --> 01:22:04,368
I've always loved her, Pete.

827
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:05,520
You know that.

828
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:06,959
It just...

829
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,960
started.

830
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:18,486
I don't believe this.

831
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:20,022
I don't believe you.

832
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:23,023
I'm really sorry.

833
01:22:23,865 --> 01:22:26,865
I just thought you should know.

834
01:22:33,851 --> 01:22:35,099
Can I warm you up?

835
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,100
Yes, please.

836
01:22:38,558 --> 01:22:41,054
How's the pie?

837
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:44,055
So good.

838
01:23:43,383 --> 01:23:46,383
Would you like a drink?

839
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:49,048
I'm sorry.

840
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:52,050
What was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr Key-to-the-city?

841
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:55,699
What did you do to her?

842
01:23:56,252 --> 01:23:57,692
I did what you failed to do.

843
01:23:57,692 --> 01:23:59,612
I was there for her.

844
01:23:59,613 --> 01:24:01,725
Mary Jane and I, we understand each other.

845
01:24:01,726 --> 01:24:03,263
She doesn't know what you are.

846
01:24:03,263 --> 01:24:06,263
Peter. She knows me very well.

847
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,159
And when she kissed me,

848
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,160
it was just like she used to kiss me.

849
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:14,330
That taste.

850
01:24:14,498 --> 01:24:17,498
Strawberries.

851
01:24:49,936 --> 01:24:52,936
How d'ya like that, Spidey?

852
01:24:54,834 --> 01:24:57,834
That all you got?

853
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:04,340
Stinks, doesn't it?

854
01:25:04,341 --> 01:25:07,341
I protected you in high school. Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

855
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:55,816
You gonna kill me like you killed my father?

856
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,121
I'm done trying to convince you.

857
01:25:58,122 --> 01:26:00,330
You took him from me.

858
01:26:00,332 --> 01:26:01,867
He loved me.

859
01:26:01,868 --> 01:26:03,115
No:

860
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:05,709
he despised you.

861
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:08,710
You were an embarrassment for him.

862
01:26:11,087 --> 01:26:14,087
Look at that little Goblin junior.

863
01:26:14,354 --> 01:26:17,354
Gonna cry?

864
01:26:50,077 --> 01:26:52,287
<i>"THIEF! Spider-Man shows his true colors"
- Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.</i>

865
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:54,400
<i>Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.</i>

866
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:56,320
My son thought the world of this guy.

867
01:26:56,321 --> 01:26:58,433
I have a 9 year old daughter, loves Spider-Man.

868
01:26:58,434 --> 01:27:00,064
Who's she supposed to look up to now?

869
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:02,851
This is the guy they gave the key to the city to?

870
01:27:02,852 --> 01:27:05,852
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

871
01:27:07,459 --> 01:27:10,459
Cheers! New staff photographer!
- I just got lucky.

872
01:27:10,919 --> 01:27:12,261
This is so wonderful for you.

873
01:27:12,263 --> 01:27:15,263
Well, you might wanna tell JJ to make a little more wall space.

874
01:27:20,907 --> 01:27:23,907
Good morning.
- It's a beautiful day, huh?

875
01:27:24,363 --> 01:27:27,363
What was it you said, I'll never get that picture?

876
01:27:27,435 --> 01:27:30,435
There's your hero.

877
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:32,334
I never thought he'd really do that.

878
01:27:32,335 --> 01:27:33,965
See? Right there,

879
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:35,311
you made a judgment call.

880
01:27:35,311 --> 01:27:36,847
You gotta see it as it is.

881
01:27:36,848 --> 01:27:38,383
It's funny you should say that,

882
01:27:38,384 --> 01:27:40,210
'cause I was looking through some old photos, and

883
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:43,210
looks very, uh-- similar.

884
01:27:46,644 --> 01:27:49,332
OK-- Well, I gotta get back to work.

885
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:50,772
You're trash, Brock.

886
01:27:50,772 --> 01:27:52,308
Excuse me?

887
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:55,309
Your picture is a fake.

888
01:27:56,824 --> 01:27:58,935
Parker, you are such a boy scout.

889
01:27:58,936 --> 01:28:01,936
When are you gonna give a guy a break?

890
01:28:03,066 --> 01:28:05,081
You want forgiveness?

891
01:28:05,082 --> 01:28:06,713
Get religion.

892
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:09,714
What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

893
01:28:11,518 --> 01:28:14,518
Yeah, no, we're just horsin' around.

894
01:28:15,742 --> 01:28:17,759
Look, I'm begging you. If you do this,

895
01:28:17,761 --> 01:28:19,296
I will lose everything.

896
01:28:19,297 --> 01:28:22,176
There's not a paper in town that will hire me.

897
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:25,154
You should've thought of that earlier.

898
01:28:25,155 --> 01:28:27,267
What are you doing, Peter?

899
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:30,268
Show this to the editor. Tell him to check his source next time.

900
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:38,694
It's a fake!

901
01:28:38,695 --> 01:28:41,695
Empire State Photographic Department confirms it.

902
01:28:46,282 --> 01:28:48,491
Pack your things. Get out of my building.

903
01:28:48,492 --> 01:28:51,492
I was just...
- You're fired!

904
01:28:52,236 --> 01:28:54,540
You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now.

905
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:56,173
Haven't printed a retraction in 20 years!

906
01:28:56,175 --> 01:28:59,175
"SORRY SPIDEY
Bugle drops charges"

907
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:03,857
Shalom?
- Mr Parker?

908
01:29:03,858 --> 01:29:06,858
Dr Connors here.
- Oh, Dr Connors!

909
01:29:07,507 --> 01:29:09,329
How are you?

910
01:29:09,331 --> 01:29:12,331
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.

911
01:29:12,885 --> 01:29:15,885
Its chemistry is not unlike the *** meteorites of the 70s.

912
01:29:19,945 --> 01:29:20,904
Thanks. It's good.

913
01:29:20,183 --> 01:29:22,776
You know what, Parker?

914
01:29:22,777 --> 01:29:23,928
Parker?

915
01:29:23,929 --> 01:29:26,425
Give me some milk.

916
01:29:26,426 --> 01:29:29,426
It amplifies characteristics of its host.

917
01:29:29,882 --> 01:29:31,034
Hey, give me another cookie.

918
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:34,034
Specially aggression.

919
01:29:34,589 --> 01:29:36,316
This can be dangerous.

920
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:39,317
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

921
01:29:39,487 --> 01:29:41,022
You got any with nuts?

922
01:29:41,023 --> 01:29:43,424
Um-- I have some nuts, I could make some.

923
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:44,672
Go make me some.

924
01:29:44,673 --> 01:29:47,673
Peter?
- No, no. Of course not.

925
01:30:01,384 --> 01:30:03,591
Your shots are so good.

926
01:30:03,592 --> 01:30:06,592
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

927
01:30:06,664 --> 01:30:09,664
Peter Parker! Peter...

928
01:30:10,026 --> 01:30:11,083
Parker!

929
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,867
Miss Brent, that's not the position I hired you for!

930
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:16,868
Black suit Spider-Man!

931
01:30:17,132 --> 01:30:19,533
Peter, these are incredible!

932
01:30:19,534 --> 01:30:21,069
We gotta have these, Jonah.

933
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:23,758
I'll pay you the usual rate.

934
01:30:23,759 --> 01:30:26,759
If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job. Double the money.

935
01:31:57,492 --> 01:32:00,492
You are really gonna dig this joint.

936
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,061
Do you think I'm dressed all right?

937
01:32:03,061 --> 01:32:05,750
Too fancy or...

938
01:32:05,751 --> 01:32:08,751
You're looking fine, babe.

939
01:32:08,919 --> 01:32:10,358
Thank you.

940
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:13,359
Love that little giggle.

941
01:32:19,963 --> 01:32:22,963
Oh, this is so cool!

942
01:32:23,709 --> 01:32:26,709
I have never been to a jazz club before.

943
01:32:28,992 --> 01:32:31,992
I hope we can get a table.

944
01:32:36,771 --> 01:32:39,771
Find us some shade.

945
01:32:40,228 --> 01:32:42,532
Thanks, ***.

946
01:32:42,534 --> 01:32:45,534
Right this way, sir.

947
01:32:48,006 --> 01:32:51,006
"RESERVED"

948
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:55,040
Thank you.

949
01:32:58,956 --> 01:33:01,956
I'm so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

950
01:33:07,981 --> 01:33:10,190
Isn't that your old girlfriend?

951
01:33:10,191 --> 01:33:11,150
Yeah.

952
01:33:11,151 --> 01:33:12,880
Do you want to go someplace else?

953
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:15,567
No, no. I'll be OK.

954
01:33:15,568 --> 01:33:18,568
Mary Jane, show us what you got.

955
01:33:24,115 --> 01:33:27,115
I'll be right back.
- Right.

956
01:33:35,737 --> 01:33:38,737
Peter?

957
01:33:39,866 --> 01:33:42,866
This is for you.

958
01:33:47,069 --> 01:33:50,069
Double time!

959
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:56,791
Thanks.

960
01:34:20,778 --> 01:34:23,778
Now dig all this.

961
01:35:04,091 --> 01:35:07,091
That was all for her?

962
01:35:13,984 --> 01:35:16,984
I'm so sorry.

963
01:35:27,812 --> 01:35:28,867
You all right, Mary Jane?

964
01:35:28,868 --> 01:35:31,868
I'm fine.
- OK.

965
01:35:33,142 --> 01:35:34,103
Hey.

966
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:40,680
What's wrong with you?

967
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,410
You.

968
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:44,138
Can I help you, sir?

969
01:35:44,139 --> 01:35:47,139
No.
- Is everything OK here, Paul?

970
01:35:47,596 --> 01:35:50,189
Yeah, is everything OK here, Paul?

971
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:52,301
Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

972
01:35:52,302 --> 01:35:55,302
Take your hand offa me. Now.

973
01:36:01,137 --> 01:36:04,137
Peter, stop!

974
01:36:13,717 --> 01:36:16,717
Who are you?

975
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:20,270
I don't know.

976
01:37:47,545 --> 01:37:49,656
It's Brock, Sir.

977
01:37:49,657 --> 01:37:52,657
Edward Brock junior.

978
01:37:53,693 --> 01:37:56,693
I come before you today

979
01:37:57,533 --> 01:38:00,533
humbled

980
01:38:00,798 --> 01:38:03,798
and humiliated

981
01:38:05,793 --> 01:38:08,793
to ask you for one thing.

982
01:38:13,284 --> 01:38:16,284
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

983
01:39:03,606 --> 01:39:06,606
Parker?

984
01:40:44,925 --> 01:40:47,925
Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

985
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:52,631
You don't seem to have changed the room around very much.

986
01:40:54,241 --> 01:40:57,241
Of course, there's not much you can do,

987
01:40:57,731 --> 01:41:00,731
is there?

988
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:06,533
When we spoke on the phone,

989
01:41:06,534 --> 01:41:09,534
I sensed something was bothering you,

990
01:41:09,703 --> 01:41:12,703
so I thought I'd just come by.

991
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:17,673
How's Mary Jane?

992
01:41:17,674 --> 01:41:20,674
I don't know.

993
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:23,434
I never heard from you.

994
01:41:23,435 --> 01:41:26,435
Did you ever propose?

995
01:41:30,544 --> 01:41:32,174
You said

996
01:41:32,176 --> 01:41:35,176
a husband's gotta put a wife before himself.

997
01:41:41,682 --> 01:41:44,682
I'm not ready.

998
01:41:44,756 --> 01:41:47,756
But what happened?

999
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:51,310
You seemed so sure.

1000
01:41:52,968 --> 01:41:53,928
Yeah. I...

1001
01:42:05,403 --> 01:42:08,403
I heard her, aunt May.

1002
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:12,820
I don't know what to do.

1003
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:16,758
You start by doing the hardest thing.

1004
01:42:17,889 --> 01:42:20,889
You forgive yourself.

1005
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:26,340
I believe in you, Peter.

1006
01:42:26,341 --> 01:42:29,341
You're a good person.

1007
01:42:30,182 --> 01:42:33,182
And I know you will find a way to put it right.

1008
01:42:42,186 --> 01:42:45,186
In time.

1009
01:43:00,337 --> 01:43:03,337
I don't like Spider-Man.

1010
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:10,228
I want him dead too, Flint.

1011
01:43:10,229 --> 01:43:12,533
That's why I've been looking for you.

1012
01:43:12,533 --> 01:43:15,533
Oh yeah. I know all about you.

1013
01:43:15,895 --> 01:43:17,848
Like the fact that Spider-Man

1014
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:20,119
won't let you help your poor daughter.

1015
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:22,233
It's just-- It doesn't seem right to me.

1016
01:43:22,234 --> 01:43:23,482
Look.

1017
01:43:23,484 --> 01:43:25,787
I wanna kill the Spider.

1018
01:43:25,788 --> 01:43:27,994
You wanna kill the Spider.

1019
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:30,995
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

1020
01:43:32,414 --> 01:43:35,414
Interested?

1021
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:38,583
Yeah.

1022
01:44:36,085 --> 01:44:38,869
So--

1023
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:40,310
where to?

1024
01:44:40,311 --> 01:44:43,311
"BREAKING NEWS: City in crisis"
- All New York is holding its breath

1025
01:44:43,322 --> 01:44:46,322
as a hostage crisis continues to unfold.

1026
01:44:46,362 --> 01:44:49,362
Just thirty minutes ago, police came across this startling sight:

1027
01:44:50,683 --> 01:44:53,021
A young woman held hostage in a taxi

1028
01:44:53,022 --> 01:44:55,581
suspended 80 storeys above the ground

1029
01:44:55,582 --> 01:44:58,365
in what appears to be a giant web.

1030
01:44:58,366 --> 01:45:01,366
Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage

1031
01:45:01,569 --> 01:45:04,569
has been flaunted by the Sandman.

1032
01:45:05,953 --> 01:45:08,953
Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure.

1033
01:45:10,274 --> 01:45:12,769
Early reports had believed him

1034
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:15,686
to be the black-suited Spider-Man. But he is now been identified

1035
01:45:15,687 --> 01:45:18,687
as something entirely different.

1036
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:20,837
The hostage has been identified

1037
01:45:20,838 --> 01:45:22,758
as Mary Jane Watson,

1038
01:45:22,759 --> 01:45:25,759
an actrice recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway.

1039
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:54,090
We're now going to take you live to the scene with Jennifer Dugan.

1040
01:45:54,644 --> 01:45:57,644
Jennifer?
- We're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and--

1041
01:45:57,908 --> 01:46:00,908
Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web.

1042
01:46:01,847 --> 01:46:04,822
It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering.

1043
01:46:04,824 --> 01:46:07,641
"SPIDER-MAN, STOP US IF YOU CAN"

1044
01:46:07,642 --> 01:46:10,642
Apparently, Spider-Man is being challenged to some sort of confrontation.

1045
01:46:10,778 --> 01:46:13,274
And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand

1046
01:46:13,275 --> 01:46:16,275
against such overwhelming...

1047
01:46:24,704 --> 01:46:27,704
Harry.

1048
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:32,098
I need your help.

1049
01:46:32,098 --> 01:46:35,098
Can't take them both. Not by myself.

1050
01:46:42,373 --> 01:46:45,373
You don't deserve my help.

1051
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:49,767
Harry,

1052
01:46:49,768 --> 01:46:52,768
she needs us.

1053
01:46:55,435 --> 01:46:58,435
Get out.

1054
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:16,010
If I may, Sir.

1055
01:47:16,659 --> 01:47:19,540
I've seen things in this house

1056
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:21,460
I've never spoken of.

1057
01:47:21,461 --> 01:47:24,461
What are you trying to tell me?

1058
01:47:24,534 --> 01:47:27,414
The night your father died

1059
01:47:27,414 --> 01:47:30,414
I cleaned his wound.

1060
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:34,160
The blade that pierced his body

1061
01:47:34,809 --> 01:47:37,809
came from his glider.

1062
01:47:38,171 --> 01:47:40,187
I know

1063
01:47:40,188 --> 01:47:42,299
you're trying to defend your father's honor,

1064
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:45,301
but there's no question

1065
01:47:45,374 --> 01:47:48,374
that he died by his own hand.

1066
01:47:51,232 --> 01:47:54,232
I loved your father.

1067
01:47:54,786 --> 01:47:57,786
As I have loved you, Harry.

1068
01:47:58,243 --> 01:48:01,243
As your friends love you.

1069
01:48:45,877 --> 01:48:48,877
Look!

1070
01:49:15,936 --> 01:49:18,936
He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city,

1071
01:49:19,681 --> 01:49:22,681
just when all hope seemed to be lost.

1072
01:49:27,557 --> 01:49:30,557
Peter?
They're gonna kill us both.

1073
01:49:30,727 --> 01:49:32,550
I'm gonna get you out of this.

1074
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:35,551
Watch out!

1075
01:49:43,211 --> 01:49:44,553
Hey, Parker.

1076
01:49:44,554 --> 01:49:45,994
My God. Eddie?

1077
01:49:45,995 --> 01:49:48,995
Oh, my spider-sense is tickling.

1078
01:49:49,838 --> 01:49:52,838
If you know what I'm talking about.

1079
01:50:10,677 --> 01:50:12,502
We can find a way to settle this.

1080
01:50:12,503 --> 01:50:14,038
You're so right.

1081
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:17,039
I'm thinking-- humiliation.

1082
01:50:18,169 --> 01:50:21,169
Kinda like you humiliated me.

1083
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,240
Do you remember?

1084
01:50:24,698 --> 01:50:27,698
Do you remember what you did to me?

1085
01:50:42,081 --> 01:50:43,905
You made me lose my girl.

1086
01:50:43,906 --> 01:50:46,906
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1087
01:50:47,365 --> 01:50:50,365
How's that sound, tiger?

1088
01:51:46,713 --> 01:51:49,713
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1089
01:52:17,446 --> 01:52:20,446
Mary Jane.

1090
01:53:17,373 --> 01:53:20,373
It's hard to believe what's happening.

1091
01:53:21,023 --> 01:53:23,421
The brutality of it.

1092
01:53:23,422 --> 01:53:26,016
I don't know how he can take any more.

1093
01:53:26,017 --> 01:53:27,936
This can be a tragic day

1094
01:53:27,936 --> 01:53:29,280
for the people of New York.

1095
01:53:29,281 --> 01:53:32,281
It could be the end of Spider-Man.

1096
01:53:57,037 --> 01:54:00,037
Awesome!
- Wicked cool!

1097
01:54:23,061 --> 01:54:26,061
You came.

1098
01:54:31,129 --> 01:54:34,129
Looks like just in the nick of time.

1099
01:54:34,396 --> 01:54:36,986
A couple of minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.

1100
01:54:36,987 --> 01:54:39,987
What're you gonna do.

1101
01:54:40,926 --> 01:54:43,517
I'm needing some help over here.

1102
01:54:43,518 --> 01:54:46,518
I'm a little busy right now.

1103
01:54:46,879 --> 01:54:49,879
Give me your hand!

1104
01:55:02,724 --> 01:55:03,973
Parker!

1105
01:55:03,973 --> 01:55:05,221
Parker, where...

1106
01:55:05,222 --> 01:55:07,333
I need a photographer!

1107
01:55:07,334 --> 01:55:08,871
Hey, kid. You want a job?

1108
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:10,695
Why would I want a job?

1109
01:55:10,696 --> 01:55:12,424
I'm just a kid.

1110
01:55:12,425 --> 01:55:13,671
All right, how much for the camera?

1111
01:55:13,672 --> 01:55:16,672
One hundred bucks.
- A hundred bucks?

1112
01:55:18,188 --> 01:55:21,188
All right, you little prick. Here.

1113
01:55:26,542 --> 01:55:29,542
Film's extra.

1114
01:55:33,361 --> 01:55:36,361
Gotcha.

1115
01:55:42,581 --> 01:55:45,581
Pete, watch out!

1116
01:56:06,590 --> 01:56:09,118
You still got any more?
- Hang on!

1117
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:12,119
To what?

1118
01:56:14,465 --> 01:56:17,465
Go, buddy!
- Got her!

1119
01:56:26,757 --> 01:56:29,757
You OK?

1120
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:32,830
Yeah.

1121
01:56:33,575 --> 01:56:35,976
Good.

1122
01:56:35,978 --> 01:56:38,978
Hey, Pete.

1123
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:42,050
Am I interrupting?

1124
01:57:53,094 --> 01:57:55,588
Never wound

1125
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:58,590
what you can't kill.

1126
01:58:02,217 --> 01:58:05,217
Eddie-- this suit-- you gotta take it off!

1127
01:58:05,675 --> 01:58:08,675
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1128
01:58:09,996 --> 01:58:12,493
I know what it feels like.

1129
01:58:12,494 --> 01:58:13,933
It feels good.

1130
01:58:13,933 --> 01:58:16,814
The power. Everything.

1131
01:58:16,815 --> 01:58:19,022
But you'll lose yourself.

1132
01:58:19,023 --> 01:58:20,656
Let it go.

1133
01:58:20,657 --> 01:58:23,657
I like being bad.

1134
01:58:24,690 --> 01:58:27,690
It makes me happy.

1135
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:16,670
Harry!

1136
02:00:25,024 --> 02:00:28,024
Peter, what are you doing?

1137
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:30,008
No!

1138
02:00:31,459 --> 02:00:34,459
Eddie!

1139
02:00:51,723 --> 02:00:53,355
Harry?
- Mary Jane.

1140
02:00:53,356 --> 02:00:54,793
I'm going to get help.

1141
02:00:54,795 --> 02:00:57,795
Stay.

1142
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,840
I didn't want this.

1143
02:01:12,273 --> 02:01:15,273
But I had no choice.

1144
02:01:17,748 --> 02:01:19,955
We always have a choice.

1145
02:01:19,956 --> 02:01:22,956
You had a choice when you killed my uncle.

1146
02:01:23,319 --> 02:01:26,319
My daughter was dying.

1147
02:01:27,447 --> 02:01:30,447
I needed money.

1148
02:01:33,882 --> 02:01:36,882
I was scared.

1149
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:46,081
I told your uncle all I wanted was the car.

1150
02:01:46,484 --> 02:01:48,540
What is it?
- I need your car.

1151
02:01:49,247 --> 02:01:51,936
He said to me:

1152
02:01:51,937 --> 02:01:54,937
"Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?"

1153
02:01:58,757 --> 02:02:01,757
I realize now he was just trying to help me.

1154
02:02:07,591 --> 02:02:10,591
Then I saw my partner running over with the cash,

1155
02:02:10,953 --> 02:02:13,953
and the gun was in my hand.

1156
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:29,510
Did a terrible thing to you.

1157
02:02:30,063 --> 02:02:33,063
I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back.

1158
02:02:38,419 --> 02:02:41,419
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1159
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:44,780
I just want you to understand.

1160
02:02:52,729 --> 02:02:55,729
I've done terrible things too.

1161
02:03:10,783 --> 02:03:13,783
You didn't choose to be this.

1162
02:03:22,021 --> 02:03:25,021
The only thing left to me now

1163
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:29,149
is my daughter.

1164
02:03:40,651 --> 02:03:43,651
I forgive you.

1165
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:26,291
Hey, pal. How are you doing?

1166
02:04:27,228 --> 02:04:29,149
Been better.

1167
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:32,150
We'll get you through this.

1168
02:04:35,681 --> 02:04:38,681
No.

1169
02:04:43,651 --> 02:04:46,651
You should never forgive...

1170
02:04:47,685 --> 02:04:50,685
...said those things.

1171
02:04:51,333 --> 02:04:54,333
None of that matters, Peter.

1172
02:04:56,423 --> 02:04:59,423
You're my friend.

1173
02:05:02,378 --> 02:05:05,378
Best friend.

1174
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:10,780
Whatever comes our way.

1175
02:06:11,525 --> 02:06:14,525
Whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice.

1176
02:06:17,671 --> 02:06:19,975
My friend Harry taught me that.

1177
02:06:19,976 --> 02:06:22,976
He chose to be the best of himself.

1178
02:06:23,721 --> 02:06:26,697
It's the choices that make us who we are,

1179
02:06:26,698 --> 02:06:29,698
and we can always choose to do what's right.

1180
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:40,620
<i>  I'm through with love</i>

1181
02:06:41,204 --> 02:06:44,108
<i>  I'll never fall again</i>

1182
02:06:44,109 --> 02:06:47,109
<i>  Said adieu to love</i>

1183
02:06:47,501 --> 02:06:50,501
<i>  Don't ever call again</i>

1184
02:06:50,793 --> 02:06:53,793
<i>  For I must have you</i>

1185
02:06:53,796 --> 02:06:56,796
<i>  Or no one</i>

1186
02:06:57,671 --> 02:07:00,671
<i>  And so I'm through with love</i>

1187
02:07:03,386 --> 02:07:06,195
<i>  I've locked my heart</i>

1188
02:07:06,195 --> 02:07:09,195
<i>  I'll keep my feelings there</i>

1189
02:07:09,295 --> 02:07:12,295
<i>  I have stocked my heart</i>

1190
02:07:12,394 --> 02:07:15,301
<i>  With icy frigid air</i>

1191
02:07:15,302 --> 02:07:18,302
<i>  And I mean to care</i>

1192
02:07:18,304 --> 02:07:21,304
<i>  For no one...</i>
