1
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,718
This is the wrong house.

2
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,422
This is not the one
I told you about.

3
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,594
I know, but I've had my eye on
this place for a long time.

4
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,098
Yeah, but there's a family here.

5
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,247
I know.

6
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,649
Come on, the one down the
road is loaded with stuff.

7
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,175
Don't worry. We'll get there.

8
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,754
But first we're gonna
take care of this place.

9
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,656
We can't.

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,558
Why not?

11
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,629
There's a family here.

12
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,432
Right, well...

13
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,690
We all kind of voted...

14
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,439
We want it.

15
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,298
We're gonna go in.

16
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,769
No occupied homes.

17
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,249
Listen...

18
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,641
We take care of our own.

19
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,788
No occupied homes.

20
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,280
That's the deal.

21
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,250
Not anymore.

22
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,960
And now to show you

23
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,895
the vast and urgent
fight underway

24
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,730
by doctors and states
across this country...

25
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,665
States across this
country tonight.

26
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,733
Center for disease
control prevention

27
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,602
has issued a dire warning

28
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,537
about one of the most
dangerous strains of bacteria

29
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,572
which resists all
known antibiotics.

30
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,641
Let us begin this half hour...

31
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,510
With a call for urgent
action this morning.

32
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,445
To stop the spread...

33
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,480
Of a so-called
"nightmare super bug."

34
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,449
Trying to contain a
new kind of bacteria

35
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,651
normal antibiotics don't reach.

36
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,487
The fear and the challenge
is to keep these bacteria

37
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,623
from reaching the
general population.

38
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,292
The normal issue of giving
someone an antibiotic

39
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,561
and curing them becomes
very difficult.

40
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,796
National guard units
were activated...

41
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,031
The president now declaring

42
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,333
the outbreak a
national emergency.

43
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,403
We are facing a potentially
dangerous problem,

44
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,705
but we do have a
window of opportunity

45
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,964
to contain it.

46
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,581
All the institutions
have failed.

47
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,286
Everyone has gone into hiding.

48
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,894
The sickness spread quickly.

49
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,576
The cities were
hollowed out in weeks.

50
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,448
We tried to set up safe zones.

51
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,907
And quarantines.

52
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,552
But sooner or later,

53
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,811
someone infected would get in.

54
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,558
And wipe everyone out.

55
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,698
All you could do is
isolate yourself

56
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,357
and your family.

57
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,361
We followed the rules.

58
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,331
Stay hidden.

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,534
Stay quiet.

60
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,780
Stay alive.

61
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,490
Three times four...

62
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,727
Why don't you teach her
something she can actually use?

63
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,019
Like how to skin a rodent?

64
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,365
All right, try it again.

65
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,033
From the top.

66
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,004
- An improper...
- Improper...

67
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,629
Can I borrow your hands?

68
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,595
I'll set it up.

69
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,203
A real feast.

70
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,729
Mm-hmm.

71
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,609
Think it's okay?

72
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,469
The smoke?

73
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,816
Yeah.

74
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,880
Probably would have been
wise to wait an hour or so.

75
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,191
Hey. No peeking. You'll
ruin the surprise.

76
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,045
Ah, that looks great.

77
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,947
Here, hold on.

78
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,148
The candle...

79
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,807
Okay.

80
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,059
It's a birthday, right?

81
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,994
We gotta make sure it's special.

82
00:06:59,018 --> 00:06:59,995
- Okay.
- Oh yeah.

83
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,187
Make a wish.

84
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,172
Can I eat it now?

85
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,741
Well, yeah. Get in there.
Happy birthday.

86
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,567
Eight years old.

87
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,113
- Mm.
- Mm.

88
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,939
Is it good?

89
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,959
Could this be your
birthday presents?

90
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,961
What is it?

91
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,590
It's an old... An old series
that used to be on the radio.

92
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,026
A long time ago.

93
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,262
Let's get it set up.

94
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,981
Terror.

95
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,176
You will know terror soon.

96
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:04,193
Our weekly series,
designed to frighten you

97
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,795
and bring you to the
edge of your seat.

98
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,690
And then withhold
the resolution.

99
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,770
This weekly study in terror

100
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,063
is brought to you by
candy toothpaste.

101
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,952
Okay, brush your teeth.

102
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,544
Get... no, get the
back ones too.

103
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,816
There you go.

104
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,719
Go swig and spit.

105
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,191
Now go to the bathroom.

106
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,652
Birdie.

107
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,111
Birdie, come on.

108
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,048
Come on.

109
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,638
I'm hungry.

110
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,097
Well, you had a lot
of food tonight.

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,669
Here you go.

112
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,020
But I already brushed my teeth.

113
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,879
Yeah, I'll let you
have a pass this time.

114
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,338
Let's have a little thanks
for what we've got.

115
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,984
Thank you for this day.

116
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,010
And thank you for
keeping us safe.

117
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,355
And for our little girl.

118
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,057
Big girl.

119
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:19,328
Our big girl. On her
eighth birthday.

120
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,762
Keep her healthy and strong.

121
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,442
Here...

122
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,401
Take it slow.

123
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,930
No, I didn't do it.

124
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,798
That's... this is
fucking bullshit, man.

125
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,767
I didn't do anything. I
didn't take anything.

126
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,969
I didn't steal anything.

127
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,337
I didn't do...

128
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,739
What's going on?

129
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,973
This little fucker
stole crackers

130
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,408
from the pantry.

131
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,976
I didn't. That's bullshit.
I didn't take anything.

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,444
Shut the fuck up.

133
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,347
Hey, rez.

134
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,915
What's up, guys?

135
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,083
- I didn't do it, rez.
- We found cracker crumbs

136
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,418
in this little shit's bed.

137
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,754
That's fucking bullshit.

138
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,956
- I didn't do it, rez.
- Okay. Okay.

139
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,281
Okay, we heard you.

140
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,387
What should I do?

141
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,474
They say you took food.

142
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,443
I didn't, rez. I swear...

143
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,545
Do you know what the penalty is

144
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,347
for taking food from our house?

145
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,282
I didn't steal, I
swear to god, rez.

146
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,418
- Come on...
- Shh.

147
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,253
Be quiet.

148
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,289
- I didn't...
- Hey, hey hey.

149
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,058
Hey, I believe you.

150
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,260
I do.

151
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,828
Thank you, rez. Thank you.

152
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,564
Do you know why?

153
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,167
Why?

154
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,936
Because I took the crackers.

155
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,849
Call everyone in.

156
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,018
We're gonna have a show.

157
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,387
Wait! What? No, rez!

158
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,588
No!

159
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,823
What's wrong, man?

160
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,295
Nothing.

161
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,443
You're not gonna try
to leave, are you?

162
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,070
Because you know I'll find you.

163
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,949
I won't be gone that long.

164
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,908
Maybe an hour, hour and a half.

165
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,921
I'd love some scotch.

166
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,814
Single malt. If they have it.

167
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,986
Uh, check the medicine cabinets.

168
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,972
Is anyone here?

169
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,965
Expired.

170
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,469
Mama don't mind.

171
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,615
Hello?

172
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,516
What are you doing, Jack?
We can't take him in.

173
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,185
I couldn't leave him there.

174
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,044
He would die.

175
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,723
We cannot take him in.

176
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,291
I couldn't leave
him there to die.

177
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,425
Do we know where he's from?

178
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,426
Who he's been running with?

179
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,396
That was a stupid move.

180
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,156
And where would you be if
we hadn't taken you in?

181
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:26,845
Russell?

182
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,260
As soon as my leg recovers,

183
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,519
I'm gonna make a move.

184
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,233
That's fine.

185
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,837
You're under no
obligation to stay.

186
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,496
Where're you going?

187
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm gonna meet my brother.

188
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,807
Let me guess, it's a safe house?

189
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,686
Refuge stocked with food?

190
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,290
Well protected?

191
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,749
Doesn't exist.

192
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,597
Pick up something for birdie.

193
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,356
Okay. I will.

194
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,559
Oh, hey...

195
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,801
Take care of my girls.

196
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,736
How did you break it?

197
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,616
I was in an accident.

198
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,389
What kind of accident?

199
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,727
Haven't you ever
asked your father?

200
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,895
Dad never tells me anything.

201
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,446
He's just trying
to keep you safe.

202
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,771
Pass me the scissors.

203
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,079
You used to have
a family, right?

204
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,318
A little girl?

205
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,595
Yeah.

206
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,764
Hey.

207
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,802
You can have a water.

208
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,816
Don't mean to intrude just
looking for some food.

209
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,725
You're not gonna try
to leave are you?

210
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,099
Because you know I'll find you.

211
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,503
Who gave you permission?

212
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,539
Get off the step now!

213
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,875
You know what, asshole?

214
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,967
Did you insult my
kids and family?

215
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,782
I'm tired of being
beat on by people.

216
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,517
You come here all the time.

217
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,788
You have been all
warned not to come.

218
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,090
Off the property now!

219
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,458
Get off now!

220
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,762
- You don't shut up.
- Get off...

221
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,658
Shit.

222
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,877
Motherfucker.

223
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,946
I knew it was bullshit.

224
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,073
God, I remember when all
this shit fell apart.

225
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,590
Ain't nothing left in us.

226
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,917
Nothing at all.
We're just animals.

227
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,630
There's nothing left
here, there's nothing.

228
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,490
We're just fucking animals.

229
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,993
Do it, pussy.

230
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,475
Go ahead, try and
make yourself a man.

231
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,778
Do it.

232
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,546
Do what you came for.

233
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,107
Okay.

234
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,920
Do it!

235
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,122
Do it!

236
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,624
Okay.

237
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,265
Can me and Kyle go outside
in the back and run around?

238
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,200
I don't know, sweetie.
Your dad's not here.

239
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,635
I'll be quiet.

240
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,060
Mom, please, mom.

241
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,832
Please.

242
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,642
Shh.

243
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,919
Keep an eye on birdie,
I'm gonna get my coat.

244
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,777
Jack says she's
been doing better.

245
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,636
Well, Jack's in denial.

246
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,786
Get inside. Inside now.

247
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,973
What was she doing outside?

248
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,641
It was for a few minutes.

249
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,134
I don't care. She
doesn't go outside.

250
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,649
What's wrong with you?

251
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:45,152
I can't trust you?

252
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,112
Birdie, get upstairs.

253
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,848
Now!

254
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,370
Don't look at me
like I'm an asshole.

255
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,272
I heard her from a
thousand yards away.

256
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,140
Anyone else in the area did too.

257
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,410
Calm down.

258
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:12,079
I'm calm.

259
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,782
When I'm not here,

260
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,107
you're their safety.

261
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,389
When I am gone, you
stick to the rules.

262
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,348
You don't go outside.

263
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,008
Terror.

264
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,869
You will know terror.

265
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,017
He's in the house right now.
I know he's gonna kill me.

266
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,019
Just a moment, please.

267
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,455
Call the police. Call them now.

268
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,981
Now.

269
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,462
Help.

270
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,765
Did you hear that?

271
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,925
He's in the house. He's
in the house right now...

272
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,712
Stay here.

273
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,228
We're sorry.

274
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,120
We can't help you.

275
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,171
We don't have anything for you, pal.
Okay?

276
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,406
So how 'bout you fuck off,

277
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,931
unless you wanna get shot?

278
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,137
Just a guy looking
for some food.

279
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,059
Birdie, did I ever tell you

280
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,994
about the safari I went on?

281
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,030
- Mm-hmm.
- I did?

282
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,999
Did I tell you about
the serengeti one?

283
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,168
I did. Mm.

284
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,170
Do you know where
the serengeti is?

285
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,238
- Tanz...
- Tanzania.

286
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,396
That's right. Very good.

287
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,924
We just tuned in.
Birdie found it.

288
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,289
What do you think it is?

289
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,215
I don't know.

290
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,465
All right, turn it off.

291
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,466
Why?

292
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,492
Batteries.

293
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,887
Are you going to leave?

294
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,935
Yeah.

295
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,269
Where are you gonna go?

296
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,538
I'm gonna go meet my brother.

297
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,141
Where?

298
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,543
He lives in a house
with a bunch of people.

299
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,178
Look, we're almost
out of inhalers.

300
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,414
We have maybe three months left.

301
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,082
There's a bunch of
new subdivisions

302
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,384
on the other side
of the interstate.

303
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,620
I can scout out some new areas.

304
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,355
Jack.

305
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,457
We should go to decatur.

306
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,725
Decatur's bad news.

307
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,026
You don't know that.

308
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,051
I do know that.

309
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,033
There's nothing out there.

310
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,326
Back when everybody was
trying to get away...

311
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,405
Your dad ever explain to you

312
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,108
what was going on?

313
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,600
The plague.

314
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,071
Yeah.

315
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,211
Who are those people?

316
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,158
Birdie's not doing well,

317
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,527
her coughing's getting worse.

318
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,029
I just feel like we're
running out of time here.

319
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,498
Daddy.

320
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,557
There's a man standing outside.

321
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,301
- What are they doing?
- They're watching us.

322
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,564
We need to leave.

323
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,566
We need to get out of here.

324
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,469
- It's time to go.
- Go where?

325
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,733
To his brother's house.

326
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,542
Why are you filling her
head with this shit?

327
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,210
It's not shit.

328
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,211
It's a pipe dream.

329
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,780
It's not a pipe dream.

330
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,115
I told you, I don't want
you filling anyone's head

331
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,251
- with this bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

332
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,776
You don't know what is outside.

333
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,228
Jack?

334
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,346
Got less than a
quarter of a tank.

335
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,581
You could make it 140.

336
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,150
Maybe 150 miles, if we're lucky.

337
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,476
If we can get it running.

338
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,495
Where are we going?

339
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,397
We're going to canton.

340
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,566
We're gonna have to go around
the perimeter of the city.

341
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,800
Should have enough gas.

342
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,593
Just hope the battery works.

343
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,700
Mom?

344
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,843
Come on, sweetie.

345
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,155
Jack?

346
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,283
Nell, let's get things packed.

347
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,785
Get the canned goods,
birdie's inhalers,

348
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,187
hats, blankets.

349
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,379
All right, let's move.

350
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,455
Let's get our stuff
in the truck.

351
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,414
All right, watch out, sweetie.

352
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,373
Get the garage door.

353
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,158
When this thing starts we're gonna
have to get out of here in a hurry.

354
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,684
Come on.

355
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,791
Please, come on.

356
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:03,955
Get the other battery.

357
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,044
Where's my radio?

358
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,947
Sweetie, I don't know. It's not
that important right now, we...

359
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,682
No, birdie. Birdie.

360
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:22,916
Birdie, come back there.

361
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,008
Jack.

362
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,458
What are you...
What are you doing?

363
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,793
Come on, let's go. We
gotta go, we gotta go.

364
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,362
Come on. Come on.

365
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
Get down.

366
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,698
Go.

367
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,623
What's the matter?

368
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,736
You're not happy to see me?

369
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,003
Okay, let's go.

370
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,415
Come on.

371
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,818
Come on. God damn it.

372
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,599
Come on. Okay.

373
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,600
Okay!

374
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,958
Door.

375
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,872
- Go Jack. Go.
- He's in. He's in.

376
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,998
Let's go. Let's go.

377
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,215
Fuck.

378
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,249
Son of a bitch.

379
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,984
How bad is it?

380
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,886
Son of a bitch, it's bad.

381
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,054
Fuck.

382
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,781
What's wrong with Kyle?

383
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,793
No, no, no, no, no...

384
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,061
You gotta keep going.

385
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,663
You gotta keep going. Just go.

386
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,532
Fuck.

387
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,867
How bad is it, Kyle?

388
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,002
It doesn't feel bad.
It doesn't feel bad.

389
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,237
Do you feel like...

390
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,872
I don't know what
we can do, guys.

391
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,207
I mean, really.

392
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,777
We have no clean rags.
We have just...

393
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,078
We need alcohol.

394
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,646
I know. We gotta find something.

395
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,081
God damn it all.

396
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,616
Look, let's just get
some place safe.

397
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
We'll figure it out.

398
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,586
How you guys doing?

399
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,732
Just passing through.

400
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,024
About to leave.

401
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,595
Hold on.

402
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,942
Give me all your food

403
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,001
or I'll blow your
fucking face off.

404
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,673
Okay.

405
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,103
You better put that gun down.

406
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,963
Go on, you little shit.

407
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,292
He's lost a lot of blood.

408
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,884
We need to get him some help.

409
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,672
How are we doing on fuel?

410
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,387
The back roads cost us but
we didn't have a choice.

411
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,146
Couldn't go on the main roads.

412
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,260
So not good.

413
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,453
Our best bet, is to go and
meet up with my brother.

414
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,133
We're not going anywhere

415
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,797
until we figure out
what to do about that.

416
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,906
We have to do something
about that light.

417
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,766
I don't want to attract
unwanted visitors.

418
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,400
We can't carry him.

419
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,550
You go.

420
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,452
Take the truck.

421
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:13,853
Find your brother.

422
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,245
And then you come back for us.

423
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,161
No.

424
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,252
Everyone goes.

425
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:29,035
I'll wait here.

426
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,327
We stick together.

427
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,966
If we leave at dawn, I'll
send someone back for Kyle.

428
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,971
No one's getting left behind.

429
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,487
You can't wait here.

430
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,079
You can come back for me.

431
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,282
We already know that's
the only option.

432
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,006
Just... keep yourself covered.

433
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,865
We'll be back as soon
as we can, okay?

434
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,893
Hello, birdie.

435
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,951
Let's move.

436
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:16,603
- Here, two bags.
- Okay.

437
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,738
We'll cut through some of
these neighborhoods up ahead.

438
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,106
Okay?

439
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,330
Got a little hike ahead of us.

440
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,623
Still in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

441
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,163
Mom, can you tell me a story?

442
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,498
Oh, sweetie. I don't have

443
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,433
any good stories in me now.

444
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:01,834
Please.

445
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,261
The Princess and the
dark knight one.

446
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:08,207
Once upon a time,

447
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,510
there was a Princess

448
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:15,181
who was being pursued
by a dark knight.

449
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:19,819
And he wore big black armor

450
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:23,656
because he had been in so
many battles and wars,

451
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,892
on his planet.

452
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,628
Was the dark knight a man?

453
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,697
Half man, half machine.

454
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,124
Yeah. Yeah, he's half
man, half machine.

455
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,704
So he had this big,
thick black armor.

456
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,740
And a deep voice.

457
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,910
And he breathed like a...

458
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,369
Eh, kinda like Russell's
breathing right now.

459
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,678
I remember this.

460
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,637
We just turn into the woods.

461
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,686
It's a short hike

462
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,311
for you guys.

463
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:29,806
It's somewhere here.

464
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,053
The marker.

465
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,446
Come on. Just a little further.

466
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,426
Daddy, I'm tired.

467
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,918
Come on, birdie.

468
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,416
We gotta keep going.

469
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,584
No.

470
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,775
Come on, birdie.

471
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:37,040
Hey. Does any of this
look familiar to you?

472
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,343
I've never been this far.

473
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,480
Whoa.

474
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,426
Let's make camp for the night.

475
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,761
We should rest.

476
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,453
Come on, right here.

477
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,667
I think we should stop.

478
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,370
We'll make camp here tonight.

479
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,971
Come on. We're close.

480
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,331
It's just over the next pass.

481
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,498
We are lost.

482
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,400
It's the last...

483
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,835
We are lost.

484
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:30,960
It's the last hill.

485
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,932
Come on.

486
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,845
Here, come on.

487
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,180
There you go.

488
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,917
There you go. Okay.

489
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,543
Where are we going?

490
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,122
Where are we going?

491
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,957
- Calm down. Calm down.
- God damn it.

492
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,017
We left Kyle in
the goddamn barn.

493
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,546
All right.

494
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,119
Oh, come on.

495
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,188
Stop here.

496
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,823
Okay.

497
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,014
Come here.

498
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,506
This isn't it.

499
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,998
This isn't it.

500
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,870
- We're done.
- Here sweetie.

501
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,084
All right.

502
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,686
All right, come on.

503
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,121
All right.

504
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,746
All right. Come on, sweetie.

505
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,196
Sorry.

506
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,142
Don't say that.

507
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,768
We're gonna take it
day by day, okay?

508
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,219
Check that out.

509
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,822
Get down.

510
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,745
Pass me the water bottle.

511
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,083
We need water, right?

512
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:51,063
Give me the bottles.

513
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,690
I'll backtrack and I'll
catch up with you guys.

514
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,894
I'll get it.

515
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,835
I don't want you
tripping over yourself.

516
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,457
Nell. Nell!

517
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,762
Oh, fuck.

518
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,947
Which way did they go?

519
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,273
Where did they go?

520
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,987
Which way did they go?

521
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,006
Nell!

522
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,946
There's a cold front
coming through today.

523
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,214
We'll make sure we're parked

524
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,515
as close to the road by sundown.

525
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,184
No, we should make it.

526
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,276
I don't know about
with this baggage.

527
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,491
Don't be scared.

528
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,693
No reason to be scared.

529
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,085
I'm not gonna hurt you.

530
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,601
Not like that cripple, see.

531
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,536
He came at me,

532
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,371
okay?

533
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,064
What I did was self-defense.

534
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,069
I believe in looking
after myself.

535
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,940
I wanna look after you, too.

536
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:45,057
And I wanna keep you safe.

537
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,626
I wanna give you love.

538
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,194
I wanna keep you warm.

539
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,197
Get your fucking hand off her.

540
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:58,670
I've got something clean

541
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,463
to put in that dirty
mouth of yours.

542
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,141
Step back. Step back!

543
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,355
- Brother...
- Drop it!

544
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,190
- Put it down.
- Brother, brother...

545
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,659
- Put it down.
- It's all right, brother.

546
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,394
Brother, it's okay.

547
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,120
Okay? Calm down.

548
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,566
There's no reason we
can't share here.

549
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,724
There's two of them.

550
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,740
This one, she's... She's
big and she's strong.

551
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,365
You can do what you
want with her.

552
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,436
But this one, she's weak.

553
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,650
She's weak.

554
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,043
You don't want her.

555
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,691
Put the gun down.

556
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,260
Put it down, brother.

557
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,162
You can be saved,

558
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,354
if you put the gun down.

559
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,636
Nell, you okay?

560
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,412
Brother, you want
to save yourself,

561
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,781
you can share the feeling.

562
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,115
Daddy!

563
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,836
Now it looks like
you've walked yourself

564
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,463
into a world of
trouble, brother.

565
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,078
But don't you worry.

566
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:47,742
I wouldn't let you leave
this world alone.

567
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,609
Which one of these females
you wanna take with you?

568
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,489
Huh?

569
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:58,614
The little one?

570
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:04,096
- You want the strong one?
- Don't...

571
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,733
- Please. -Or do you
want the weak one?

572
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,669
You want me to make
your mind up for you?

573
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,438
- No.
- Which one?

574
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:16,708
Cat got your tongue, mister?

575
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,611
Huh?

576
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:21,813
Maybe I'll make your
mind up for you?

577
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,782
No.

578
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,550
Told you to repent, brother.

579
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:42,260
Were you with my brother?

580
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,220
