00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:42,312
THE PACT OF SILENCE

2
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:25,944
Screel deen!

3
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,383
Screel deen!

4
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:02,282
Help!

5
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,114
Open the door!

6
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,622
Open up!

7
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,044
Shut up in there!

8
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,276
Shut up!

9
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,521
Scan?

10
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:15,991
Normal.

11
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:17,728
Symptoms?

12
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,465
Fever and acute abdominal pain.

13
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,667
Appendix?

14
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,632
Already removed.

15
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,096
I can't find a thing.

16
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,500
- How reassuring!
- Not for me.

17
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,537
Her pulse is elevated.

18
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,971
She has violent abdominal pain.

19
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,567
I'm keeping her in for observation.

20
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,236
But you said she's fine.

21
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,780
So it seems.

22
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,379
I'm taking her out.

23
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,973
I can't allow it.

24
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:12,642
I'll bring her back tomorrow.

25
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,654
Do you have her file?

26
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,656
When can she travel?

27
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,854
She has to leave?

28
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:23,758
We're closing the mission temporarily.

29
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,959
Didn't you know? Aren't you leaving, too?

30
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:28,993
Yes, home to Paris.

31
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,834
- What about her file?
- I've forgotten it.

32
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:34,670
No, let me handle this.

33
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:41,246
Quiet now.

34
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,713
See you tomorrow.

35
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:05,599
I almost forgot.

36
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:07,434
No drugs.

37
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,940
Only herbs.

38
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:11,006
It's against our rules.

39
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,841
Mother Emmanuelle.

40
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:15,745
What does "screel deen" mean?

41
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,144
Sister Sarah often cries out...

42
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:21,279
something like "screel deen"
or "creel deen."

43
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,246
Do you understand that?

44
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:25,121
No. I have no idea.

45
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:26,813
Something wrong?

46
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,188
No, I'm okay.

47
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,120
I'm okay.

48
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:38,858
Here.

49
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,925
A cheeseburger.

50
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:44,162
Bet you haven't eaten junk like that in ages.

51
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,028
Why the transfer?

52
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,198
What'd she do?

53
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,673
Don't ask.

54
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:52,037
It'd spoil your appetite.

55
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:04,554
Lowlife!

56
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,019
Scum!

57
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:29,614
How are your hands?

58
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,619
Lucky you're never the aggressor.
It'd endanger your parole.

59
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:37,084
So you're studying math.

60
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,853
How far are you?

61
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,424
I'm due to take my master's.

62
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:45,392
Fractals. Aren't they a bit boring?

63
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,065
It passes the time.

64
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,041
You wouldn't rather be
separated from the others?

65
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,201
I've had enough of solitary.

66
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:59,176
That's not too smart.

67
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:03,572
We'll try to keep your secret,
but they'll find out.

68
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,977
The guards won't always be around.

69
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,634
Snore and you're out.

70
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,743
You're not eating?

71
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,843
Are you French?

72
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,880
How's the pain?

73
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:18,990
I can't feel a thing.

74
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,856
Must be your drugs.

75
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:24,363
That decoction of herbs. Who prescribed it?

76
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,227
Mother Emmanuelle.

77
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,725
She prescribes potions?

78
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,867
Not her.

79
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,770
A so-called saint from Bechoa.

80
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:37,100
Santa Omeira, the healer.

81
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:40,171
An adherent of shamanism.

82
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:44,773
Mother Emmanuelle says
she's a better Catholic than any of us.

83
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:52,957
It belongs to a girl next door.

84
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,428
When can I get out?

85
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,262
That's up to you.

86
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,633
I haven't decided a thing in 10 years.

87
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:09,302
The nurse says you're a Cecilian.

88
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,440
Priest and doctor?

89
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,608
That nurse sure says a lot.

90
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,520
It protects me.

91
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:24,716
From what?

92
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:28,818
- You don't believe in it?
- I believe in miracles of faith...

93
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,956
the power of the soul over the body.

94
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,936
And I believe it's not your body
that's suffering right now.

95
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,969
You can talk to me.

96
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,437
To the priest or the doctor?

97
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,907
How old are you?

98
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:48,975
Nearly 25.

99
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,449
Have you been a Carmelite long?

100
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,650
Ten years.

101
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,115
Ten years.

102
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:58,022
Isn't that a bit young to follow a calling?

103
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,617
I haven't lost my faith, you know.

104
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:03,159
I'm not pretending to be sick.

105
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,194
Were you near Yorin during the rioting?

106
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,499
I wasn't one of the nuns who got raped.
You're on the wrong track.

107
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:13,836
If I'm on the wrong track...

108
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,934
then there's a right one.

109
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,984
No! It's been 10 years.

110
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,559
The mirror.

111
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:35,823
We're not allowed.

112
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,188
Will you be okay?

113
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:44,564
- Please leave me alone.
- Are you going back to France?

114
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,769
Do you have family there?

115
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,934
I don't see them anymore.

116
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,307
Listen.

117
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,315
That's how he got me.

118
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,514
- Come on.
- No.

119
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,311
- Come on.
- No.

120
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:46,527
He knocked me up.

121
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,798
Christ, that bastard knew
what he was doing.

122
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,030
You got a guy?

123
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:13,416
You prefer muff-diving?

124
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:16,091
Not that I know of.

125
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,954
I hate lesbos.

126
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:20,296
All I like is cock.

127
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,827
Nothing like a nice, big cock...

128
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,564
don't you think?

129
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:29,632
What's wrong?

130
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:32,874
Nothing.

131
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,377
I don't know.

132
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:37,950
I get this pain here.

133
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,884
The infirmary's there to be used, you know.

134
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:43,286
How long have you been inside?

135
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:46,657
Two years?

136
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,387
Five?

137
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,122
More?

138
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:51,857
Ten?

139
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,532
I get it.

140
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,931
You can't have had much time
to sit on a lot of cocks.

141
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,108
Ten years!

142
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,869
That's rough.

143
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,504
What'd you do?

144
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,376
It's been too long. I've forgotten.

145
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,144
Hey, no sweat.

146
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,852
You'll tell me in your own good time.

147
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:53,554
Where's Sister Sarah?

148
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,652
- She was taken away.
- She's not here.

149
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,356
She's left.

150
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,825
They've all left.

151
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,444
Your Grace...

152
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:26,255
You know I did not search
for God in the scriptures...

153
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,089
like St. Augustine.

154
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:33,227
Nor did I find him on the road
to Damascus, like St. Paul.

155
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,097
One day I shouted his name...

156
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,764
like any sinner
overwhelmed by pain and wrongdoing.

157
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:43,140
He asked me to fight for him...

158
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:46,572
and to love others as I do myself.

159
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:51,451
Ever since, on every continent...

160
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,316
in all latitudes, I have fought.

161
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:59,290
I have fought and fought.

162
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,960
But now...

163
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:05,661
I no longer know for whom I am fighting.

164
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,832
I no longer know how to love.

165
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:15,071
You must help me, your Grace.

166
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:17,340
Help me.

167
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:00,944
Don't thank me.

168
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,951
I'm not the only one in high places
to have noticed you.

169
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,218
You deserve to go to Rome.

170
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,487
It seems too...

171
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,894
What? Too comfortable?

172
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,791
Would you prefer Pakistan?

173
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:17,999
It won't do you any harm to slow down.

174
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,502
You're too hard on yourself.

175
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,333
You and I know why.

176
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,744
I need to stay for a few days.

177
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,208
In Paris?

178
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:31,773
No, there's nothing for you here.

179
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:34,878
One of my patients is worrying me.

180
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,354
One of your patients?

181
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,257
A Carmelite.

182
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,561
She was brought back in serious condition.

183
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:44,330
Where is she now?

184
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,126
St. Pierre Clavet.

185
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:50,669
I'd like to treat her.

186
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:54,035
Forget it.
They won't let you anywhere near her.

187
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,266
They refuse all medicine.

188
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:58,640
With your authorization, I...

189
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,640
Out of the question.

190
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:04,843
I can't force fundamentalist Carmelites
to accept your presence.

191
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:08,144
I received your letter.

192
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:12,022
I'm losing my sense of purpose.

193
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,824
But you spend your time
supporting other people...

194
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,363
helping them, healing them.

195
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,665
There comes a time...

196
00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:25,596
when you have to forgive yourself, Joachim.

197
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,844
God has turned you into a new man.

198
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:34,436
Someone you can love.

199
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,908
Are you sure you spoke
to Mother Emmanuelle?

200
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:50,015
She's sick enough as it is.

201
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:11,202
How long has she been like this?

202
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:13,109
Since she came back.

203
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:20,347
Get me some water.

204
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:57,386
An IV every three hours.

205
00:21:57,924 --> 00:22:00,085
We don't use chemical substances.

206
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,685
It's not chemical, it's an opiate.

207
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:05,861
Please try and find her file.

208
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:17,773
What are you doing?

209
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,603
Who let you in?

210
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:25,376
That file is strictly confidential.

211
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,780
Sister Sarah is very sick.

212
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,554
She needs to be hospitalized.

213
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,355
She's totally dehydrated.

214
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:36,895
What more can you do in your hospital?

215
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,555
Force-feed her?

216
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:41,357
I already do that three times a day.

217
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:44,767
You don't know her.
It's not her first depression.

218
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:47,231
I raised her, I know her.

219
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:49,700
The Bishop's permitted it.

220
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:54,908
You'll find nothing here to help her.

221
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,888
Father!

222
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:10,054
Yes?

223
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:11,862
Come here.

224
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,929
Go see Mother Joseph.
She knows Sarah best.

225
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,174
She took her in to the convent
the same year as me.

226
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:26,034
Tell me more.

227
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:30,479
Sister Sarah's very secretive.

228
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,575
Here. Take this.

229
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:34,847
What is it?

230
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,422
My cell phone.

231
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,979
It's a phone?

232
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:40,553
- Take it.
- My God, I can't.

233
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,093
My number's on the back.

234
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:45,562
Call me from anywhere,
whenever you want. Take it.

235
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,868
You press the little buttons.

236
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:41,681
Excuse me, but it's my only pleasure.

237
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:43,550
Having hair again.

238
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,986
This is from Sister Amélie.

239
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:49,321
The archivist.

240
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:50,794
How sweet.

241
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,325
Why was it you're here?

242
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,333
To talk about Sister Sarah.

243
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:57,729
- Sister Sarah?
- Remember her?

244
00:24:58,271 --> 00:25:00,034
Poor little Sarah.

245
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:02,803
How she used to scream at night.

246
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:06,902
Only Mother Emmanuelle and I
could calm her down.

247
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:09,479
- And her nightmares!
- What nightmares?

248
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,040
Now that she never let us in on.

249
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,920
We weren't supposed to show favoritism.

250
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:19,387
But she touched
my stubborn old Norman heart...

251
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:21,790
as my father used to call it.

252
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:24,191
Did you know Papa?

253
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:26,863
Sister Sarah, Mother.

254
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:29,763
I remember.

255
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,598
The Archbishop always said:

256
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:34,468
"She's done enough wrong. Pray for her."

257
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:36,332
Sarah did wrong?

258
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:39,173
No, not Sarah! Her sister!

259
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:42,712
I didn't know she had a sister.

260
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,415
It's not in her file.

261
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,318
Mother Emmanuelle removed it.

262
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:51,047
To protect her.

263
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,588
She was crazy about the girl.

264
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:56,294
Protect her from what?

265
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:01,092
Look, I think it's time for my nap.

266
00:26:01,234 --> 00:26:03,099
I swore not to tell anyone.

267
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,535
On the Bible, too.

268
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:10,506
Okay, all I know is...

269
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,737
that it was about a murder.

270
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:14,643
A murder so terrible...

271
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:18,148
that Sarah's sister
went to prison at 14. For life!

272
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:20,185
What murder?

273
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:22,818
Look in that drawer.

274
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:26,391
The drawer over there.

275
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,967
Screel deen.

276
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:49,946
You bitch!

277
00:26:50,383 --> 00:26:51,543
Cunt!

278
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,581
I'll show you! Come here!

279
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,656
I'll kill you!

280
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,283
So you killed a kid.

281
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:02,622
Get up!

282
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:19,768
You never cry.

283
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:21,039
What?

284
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:24,381
Ten years inside, and not a tear.

285
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:28,250
Even when they broke
your collarbone or burned your hands.

286
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:31,079
You read up on me. I'm flattered.

287
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,350
Still having nightmares?

288
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,220
Describe them.

289
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:39,927
It's in the file.

290
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,694
Tell me, anyway.

291
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,100
Aren't you sick of hearing the same shit?
I'm sick of saying it.

292
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,569
Do you at least regret it?

293
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,840
What?

294
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,379
All of it.

295
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:02,217
I should note that answer.

296
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:04,449
- I didn't answer.
- Precisely.

297
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,286
See this red pen?

298
00:28:06,826 --> 00:28:09,920
One mark and you stay
for another five years.

299
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,964
Is that what you want?

300
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:17,125
Sometimes I think you don't want to get out.

301
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,406
Search for LENNECK

302
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:24,942
Searching...

303
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:26,978
[File not found]

304
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,580
[Try a different spelling]

305
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,361
Twins?

306
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:51,733
Yes, now that you mention it.

307
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,704
Isn't nature strange?

308
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,137
I forgot to tell you...

309
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:58,267
the other day.

310
00:28:58,378 --> 00:28:59,402
What?

311
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:00,738
She gave it to me.

312
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:02,440
What did she give you?

313
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,806
Her secret book.

314
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,210
Can you read it to me?

315
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:07,047
No, it's in their language.

316
00:29:07,153 --> 00:29:09,212
A foreign language?

317
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:11,581
Their own "twin language."

318
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,487
But isn't there a drawing...

319
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:16,323
an address, a name?

320
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:17,827
Nothing.

321
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,956
Oh, yes, I see her name.

322
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,396
Sarah Le Belleck.

323
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:25,198
Sarah Le Belleck?

324
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:28,398
She was signed in
to the convent as Lenneck.

325
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:40,747
Are you a preacher? I mean, a priest?

326
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:42,184
Yes, why?

327
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:45,816
Four years in this hole,
you're the first I've seen.

328
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:50,024
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

329
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:06,338
JUDICIAL

330
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,716
LE BELLECK CASE.

331
00:30:51,457 --> 00:30:52,981
A demon?

332
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,651
SUFFOCATED

333
00:30:55,862 --> 00:30:58,126
Babysitter killer gets life

334
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:08,603
What's this to you?

335
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:11,634
You the kid's confessor?

336
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:15,678
I say "kid," but she must be, what,
24, 25 by now.

337
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:18,043
Do you know her?

338
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:20,443
No.

339
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:24,420
Any new developments?

340
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,952
You're not very talkative.

341
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,820
I understand.

342
00:32:00,827 --> 00:32:02,158
Father...

343
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:04,989
call if I can help with the Le Belleck case.

344
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:07,760
The newsroom's up there. My little paradise.

345
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:10,267
A good scoop and I go to heaven.

346
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,863
Show some charity, Father.

347
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:31,319
Give that to the man outside.

348
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:35,589
- But Mother...
- This is all your fault. Give it to him.

349
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:54,302
Gaëlle Le Belleck gets out at noon.

350
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,079
So who are you again?
Are you the family's confessor?

351
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,380
No, her sister Sarah's.

352
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:05,580
- Shall I let Gaëlle know?
- I'd rather you didn't.

353
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,850
Fine. Be here at noon.

354
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:15,259
Twins

355
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:22,265
Dialogue in utero

356
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:31,180
Identical twins share
99.9 percent of their DNA.

357
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:34,745
So it's difficult for people to understand...

358
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:37,550
that they're two individuals.

359
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:39,022
Two souls.

360
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,591
If you like, but I'm an atheist.

361
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:44,828
It's a classic case of symmetry.

362
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:48,891
One of those things
that embarrass the academy and myself.

363
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:52,437
I'm a rationalist, so I like clear explanations.

364
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:54,802
There isn't any for symmetry.

365
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,840
One twin can be sick, but the other
displays the symptoms...

366
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:00,674
often miles away.

367
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,643
You mean it may not be the nun who's sick?

368
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:07,214
Yes, but both may be in danger.

369
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:10,551
The one with the symptoms might die.
It happens.

370
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,017
Those New Agers love it.

371
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,390
Those who believe
in the brain's occult powers, telepathy...

372
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:22,263
talking plants, that trendy stuff.

373
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:53,794
You understand Latin?
We got a divine message for you.

374
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,300
Forget Le Belleck.

375
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,394
"Ad seculum seculorum."

376
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:05,376
Screw up and you'll be back here.

377
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:06,873
Forever.

378
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,778
Never forget that.

379
00:36:11,744 --> 00:36:13,609
When did she get out?

380
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:14,803
An hour ago.

381
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,748
The State is more punctual
than the Church, apparently.

382
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:21,046
Where did she go?

383
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,954
I can't divulge that kind of information,
even to a priest.

384
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:27,054
I have to find her.

385
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,694
Aren't you going too far, Father?

386
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:31,621
No.

387
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:34,693
I don't think so.

388
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,730
She has a job interview tomorrow.

389
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:08,022
I expected you tonight.

390
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:11,828
Come in. They're harmless.

391
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:16,964
I breed dogs.

392
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:19,337
It helps make ends meet.

393
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:20,901
Where's Mama?

394
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:23,678
Come in.

395
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:10,455
Mama.

396
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:21,364
My little girl.

397
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:24,704
They let you out.

398
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:33,215
Sit down.

399
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:35,652
You must be starving.

400
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:38,348
It's such a long journey.

401
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:42,494
I know Brazil as if I'd been there.
I read up on it.

402
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:45,457
But the flight...

403
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,294
was too expensive.

404
00:38:51,837 --> 00:38:54,135
You don't wear a veil in town?

405
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:57,335
Mama.

406
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,044
It's GaëIle.

407
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:02,508
Not Sarah. GaëIle.

408
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:10,218
Get out!

409
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:13,422
- I've nowhere to go.
- Get out!

410
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:18,360
I never want to see you again!

411
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,661
GaëIle!

412
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:31,106
I didn't know how to tell you.

413
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:34,575
It got worse after the trial.

414
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,580
You can't stay here.

415
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:42,053
It'd only make her worse.

416
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:43,679
You understand?

417
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,520
- Where are you going?
- I've got some addresses for a job.

418
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:51,596
Do you need money for a room?

419
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,702
I am not dying

420
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,943
I am entering into life

421
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:10,639
I am not dying

422
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:15,277
I am ascending into love

423
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,393
Screel deen.

424
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,109
Happy birthday

425
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:47,675
May you have a lovely day

426
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:51,917
May this cake bring you joy in every way

427
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,651
- You maniac!
- I didn't see you.

428
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:23,119
- In the middle of the road?
- Sorry. Are you hurt?

429
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:25,048
No.

430
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:26,922
I'm sorry.

431
00:41:30,996 --> 00:41:33,863
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, forget it.

432
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:35,328
Hop on.

433
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:39,196
It's my fault. I feel guilty.
Let me make it up to you.

434
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:42,906
I'm Xavier.

435
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,138
And you?

436
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:48,173
Sarah.

437
00:41:54,953 --> 00:41:56,113
Sarah.

438
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:57,449
Hop on.

439
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:19,776
Thank you.

440
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,971
I'll pay you back soon.

441
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:26,177
I insist.

442
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:27,946
It's my pleasure.

443
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,153
What were you doing
in the middle of nowhere?

444
00:42:31,256 --> 00:42:33,121
What were you doing?

445
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:34,318
Me?

446
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,825
I was lost.

447
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:38,857
Funny, so was I.

448
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,362
Yeah, that is funny.

449
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:50,673
Want a lift? Where do you live?

450
00:42:55,047 --> 00:42:56,605
Come on, jump on.

451
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:58,238
Don't be shy.

452
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:01,977
So you got nowhere to go?

453
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:06,652
- Want to stay at my place?
- I don't know you.

454
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:08,818
I don't know you, either.

455
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:13,290
Do what you like. I won't force you.

456
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,894
Anyway, I'm not sleeping at home tonight.

457
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,731
I work in a hotel.

458
00:43:20,873 --> 00:43:23,000
Make your mind up, GaëIle.

459
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:28,377
What did you call me?

460
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,941
Who, me? What do you mean?

461
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:34,176
How do you know my name, bastard?

462
00:43:34,286 --> 00:43:36,447
What are you talking about?

463
00:43:37,556 --> 00:43:39,751
- You scumbag!
- Yeah, I am.

464
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:42,725
A scumbag hack after a story.

465
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:46,728
Get lost!

466
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,026
Get lost!

467
00:45:41,513 --> 00:45:42,844
Joachim, stop it!

468
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:58,292
Why come here first?

469
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:01,891
There are other places on the list.

470
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,225
The chaplain in jail...

471
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,766
told me you often train ex-offenders.

472
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:12,736
I could put all your data onto CD-ROM.
I studied Excel.

473
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,211
Yes, but...

474
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,646
Life imprisonment after all...

475
00:46:20,919 --> 00:46:22,580
You're so young.

476
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:25,551
Listen.

477
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:29,860
I'm asking you to refuse this job yourself.

478
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,460
Just say it doesn't suit you.

479
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,100
I'm appealing to your Christian spirit.

480
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,187
You're appealing to my Christian spirit!

481
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:23,576
GaëIle Le Belleck!

482
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:28,615
I have to talk to you about your sister.

483
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:31,053
Yes, Sarah.

484
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,292
GaëIle, please listen!

485
00:47:38,196 --> 00:47:39,595
No, listen!

486
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,533
GaëIle, listen to me!

487
00:47:43,468 --> 00:47:45,732
Who told you about my sister?

488
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:51,268
I've nothing to say to you.

489
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,200
Listen to me.

490
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,822
Acute peritonitis. We need to operate.

491
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:26,567
Maybe we should call the hospital.

492
00:49:08,854 --> 00:49:10,754
Oh, my God. Sarah!

493
00:49:20,098 --> 00:49:21,622
She's walking!

494
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,612
Lord, we offer you our toil.

495
00:49:39,718 --> 00:49:42,312
For your glory and the world's suffering.

496
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,583
We give grace for our souls' salvation...

497
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:47,782
and our bodies' healing.

498
00:50:01,606 --> 00:50:03,870
Gaëlle, Gaëlle!

499
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:06,242
Wait for me.

500
00:50:17,856 --> 00:50:19,687
Gaëlle, wait for me.

501
00:50:47,986 --> 00:50:50,750
You force your way into a convent.

502
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,187
What's more, you forge my signature!

503
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,850
And all for what?

504
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,656
For a Carmelite who's in perfect health.

505
00:50:57,762 --> 00:50:59,957
St. Pierre Clavet's archivist contacted us.

506
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:02,932
Sister Sarah is healed. Healed!

507
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:06,564
Because I operated on her twin.

508
00:51:06,671 --> 00:51:09,663
You're suspended from the priesthood.

509
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:12,073
- My decision is final.
- Until when?

510
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:14,475
Until you come to your senses.

511
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,884
You got many friends like this?

512
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:02,324
They're not friends.
He's a medical professor.

513
00:52:02,594 --> 00:52:06,428
A specialist on twins.
I consulted him about you and Sarah.

514
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:08,995
He only knows your symptoms.

515
00:52:09,401 --> 00:52:11,392
There are the children.

516
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:18,175
Joachim, at last!

517
00:52:18,276 --> 00:52:20,642
- Suzanne's three weeks early.
- We need to talk.

518
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:23,339
Sure, but could it wait a few hours?

519
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,309
Can you mind the children?

520
00:52:25,383 --> 00:52:27,715
I haven't had time to call anyone.

521
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,720
Can I count on you, Father?

522
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:38,053
Father Joachim's going to mind you.

523
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:42,093
We won't be long.

524
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:54,836
Feel like a few hours of normal life?

525
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,217
They're sleeping.

526
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:08,789
What does "screel deen" mean?

527
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:18,726
It's a warning.

528
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:23,236
To alert the other of danger.

529
00:53:24,442 --> 00:53:26,933
What's stopping you from seeing Sarah?

530
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,485
Not everyone
likes to stare the past in the face.

531
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:46,589
I want to live, do the things I've never done.

532
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:53,600
Why are you helping me?

533
00:53:53,705 --> 00:53:54,933
Why me?

534
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:57,640
Why not you?

535
00:53:59,144 --> 00:54:01,135
True, priests help everyone...

536
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:03,214
especially black sheep.

537
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:07,247
Why won't you see Sarah again?

538
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,381
Did she tell you I existed?

539
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:16,086
You found me all by yourself?
Not very Christian of her, was it?

540
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:20,123
It's none of your business.

541
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:24,892
Why is she shut away in a convent?

542
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,270
I guess she's a believer...

543
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:28,930
a bit like you.

544
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:32,303
Why does your mother reject you?

545
00:54:32,377 --> 00:54:34,538
Is this a cross-examination?

546
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,547
You sure you're not a cop, too? I'm tired.

547
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,860
Your room.

548
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:55,898
Have a good night's...

549
00:56:15,013 --> 00:56:16,139
Don't tell.

550
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:02,682
Mommy, Mommy!

551
00:57:04,729 --> 00:57:06,390
I want my mommy!

552
00:57:14,205 --> 00:57:15,399
He can't sleep.

553
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:17,667
Maybe you should get Mommy.

554
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,440
She'll be back soon with a new baby.

555
00:57:25,149 --> 00:57:27,117
It's too early to get up.

556
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:28,652
Go to sleep.

557
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,037
It couldn't be you.

558
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,300
You can't have done it.

559
00:57:54,479 --> 00:57:55,776
Why not?

560
00:57:57,181 --> 00:57:58,773
It's not possible.

561
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,613
Tell me the truth.

562
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:02,477
What do you want?

563
00:58:02,553 --> 00:58:04,043
A confession?

564
00:58:05,123 --> 00:58:06,852
You never killed.

565
00:58:08,092 --> 00:58:09,821
Do you want me to deny it?

566
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:12,623
I can't because I did it.

567
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:14,891
I killed him, you hear me?

568
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:34,947
Tell me the truth.

569
00:58:44,295 --> 00:58:46,126
For the love of God.

570
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:52,692
I don't believe in God.

571
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:57,933
I don't know
if I'm allowed a second chance...

572
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,807
but I'm taking it.

573
00:59:06,984 --> 00:59:08,849
I want to start over.

574
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,887
But it's not possible here.

575
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,595
You have to help me.

576
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,795
Help you do what?

577
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:27,033
Do what?

578
00:59:27,538 --> 00:59:29,267
Leave the country.

579
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:35,609
Save me.

580
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:39,312
Save me.

581
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:46,485
Save me.

582
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:02,633
Daddy!

583
01:00:09,413 --> 01:00:13,213
You've got a baby sister called Aurélie.

584
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:19,214
I'm asking for help, not a sermon.

585
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:21,588
Helping her break parole!

586
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,450
You've gone crazy.

587
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:27,259
- I'll take the risk.
- For a murderer?

588
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:30,265
To think you brought her into our house.

589
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:33,495
- With our children!
- I didn't mean to.

590
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:34,935
Open your eyes!

591
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:38,032
She's making you leave France illegally...

592
01:00:38,142 --> 01:00:39,507
and renounce your faith.

593
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:41,841
I'm not renouncing anything.

594
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:44,374
I know why you entered the priesthood.

595
01:00:44,448 --> 01:00:46,712
This girl has nothing to do with you.

596
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:49,048
No 12-year-old commits a crime like that...

597
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,111
unless she's a monster.

598
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,648
A monster?

599
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,056
All I see is a woman.

600
01:01:45,977 --> 01:01:47,342
You killed him!

601
01:02:07,565 --> 01:02:08,862
Joachim?

602
01:02:55,846 --> 01:02:57,040
Right.

603
01:02:57,214 --> 01:02:58,579
Of course.

604
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:01,084
You in love?

605
01:03:02,486 --> 01:03:04,147
Congratulations!

606
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,983
When do I get the passport?

607
01:03:07,124 --> 01:03:08,148
Tomorrow.

608
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:09,692
11:00, here.

609
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:14,159
I know I don't look it, but I'm fast.

610
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,565
All right.

611
01:03:17,935 --> 01:03:19,766
11:00 here tomorrow.

612
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,760
Welcome to Brazil.

613
01:05:22,026 --> 01:05:26,258
I have the impression I saw you
come through here two or three days ago.

614
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,458
I don't speak...

615
01:05:28,532 --> 01:05:31,330
Didn't you come through
two or three days ago?

616
01:05:34,605 --> 01:05:35,970
Pardon me.

617
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,704
I'll translate for her.

618
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,770
Have you already been through here?

619
01:05:42,646 --> 01:05:44,113
She says no.

620
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:09,098
Welcome to Brazil, Sister.

621
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:42,793
- Hello?
- Father Joachim, it's me.

622
01:07:44,735 --> 01:07:46,999
We had to come back from France.

623
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,369
I've been trying to call you for days.

624
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,567
- Where are you?
- In Ceara.

625
01:07:51,642 --> 01:07:53,701
We've just arrived, too.

626
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:56,302
Sister Sarah's doing worse.

627
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:59,177
- I thought she'd recovered.
- She's letting herself die.

628
01:07:59,483 --> 01:08:01,542
She's lost the use of her legs.

629
01:08:01,652 --> 01:08:02,846
She keeps calling...

630
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,547
for a certain Gaëlle.

631
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,681
We're off to see Santa Omeira.

632
01:08:06,757 --> 01:08:08,987
Mother Emmanuelle
says it's her last chance.

633
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:13,358
11... 00 tonight, Praia de Oro.

634
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:17,227
Sister Amélie, we need you.

635
01:08:19,903 --> 01:08:21,461
Coming, Mother.

636
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,809
Get out of here!

637
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,893
Hello? Mother Emmanuelle, please.

638
01:08:53,404 --> 01:08:54,962
Yes, I'll hold.

639
01:09:11,588 --> 01:09:13,078
It was a journalist.

640
01:09:13,157 --> 01:09:14,624
Don't worry.

641
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,821
I'll protect you from him.

642
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,464
You don't want any?

643
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:32,031
No one will ever love you as I do.

644
01:09:33,477 --> 01:09:35,172
Go on, have some.

645
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:51,059
Buon giorno.

646
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,529
Not a room.

647
01:09:54,598 --> 01:09:56,998
I'm looking for friends. French.

648
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:00,663
A big guy, strong...

649
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:04,138
with a brunette. Dark hair.

650
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:07,205
Friends. French.

651
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:39,638
Where are we going?

652
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:44,903
Where are we?

653
01:10:45,983 --> 01:10:47,780
Your sister's here.

654
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:49,011
What?

655
01:10:49,086 --> 01:10:53,079
She keeps asking for you. She needs you.
You can't refuse her that.

656
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:54,919
You lured me here?

657
01:10:56,093 --> 01:10:58,084
You had it all planned!

658
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:15,832
- Help me, Mother!
- My child.

659
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:17,668
God sent him to me. Not to her!

660
01:12:17,774 --> 01:12:19,639
To me, to me...

661
01:12:21,411 --> 01:12:22,639
To me!

662
01:12:31,255 --> 01:12:32,586
Oh, fuck!

663
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,007
Beat me up, I don't care!

664
01:12:58,115 --> 01:13:00,515
I've waited too long for a story like this.

665
01:13:00,617 --> 01:13:03,108
I've e-mailed it all to my paper.

666
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:06,019
I know all about her past and yours.

667
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:07,952
Stop it!

668
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:10,749
I didn't say where you're hiding.

669
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:13,762
But you know the saying:
"God is in the details."

670
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:15,695
Well, I need details.

671
01:13:15,999 --> 01:13:18,399
Give me the details and I'll keep quiet.

672
01:13:18,502 --> 01:13:20,129
It'll give you a head start.

673
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:24,105
Then you'll read my article
in the tropics, instead of jail.

674
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:27,470
What do you say?

675
01:13:28,178 --> 01:13:30,305
- No?
- Where's your hotel?

676
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,946
The little place on the square.

677
01:13:34,217 --> 01:13:35,684
In one hour.

678
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:40,586
Come on.

679
01:14:16,226 --> 01:14:19,195
Wait for me at the hotel. Don't go anywhere.

680
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:14,741
Hello, Joachim?

681
01:15:18,321 --> 01:15:19,754
It's Sarah.

682
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:21,084
Sarah?

683
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:32,294
St. Joseph's Church?

684
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,269
It's here.

685
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:45,378
Come in.

686
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,263
You're photogenic.

687
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:11,805
Sit down.

688
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:06,027
What are you doing in my office?

689
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,927
How did you get in?

690
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:20,376
I saw it all. She started to talk, to walk!

691
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:23,201
With my own eyes! It's a miracle!

692
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:30,214
Mother Emmanuelle?

693
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:10,359
Where is she?

694
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:12,617
Where is she?

695
01:19:23,266 --> 01:19:24,631
Lia ba mi.

696
01:19:26,336 --> 01:19:28,065
Sio tan soliander.

697
01:19:28,672 --> 01:19:30,230
I missed you...

698
01:19:31,007 --> 01:19:32,770
my sister, my love.

699
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:36,803
- I am you.
- Sio tu.

700
01:19:36,913 --> 01:19:38,972
- You are me.
- Et tu sio.

701
01:19:39,749 --> 01:19:41,876
I am sleeping and you...

702
01:19:42,052 --> 01:19:43,713
You're dreaming.

703
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,311
- Tu lalia ima ninora.
- You sing.

704
01:19:46,389 --> 01:19:48,550
And Mama no longer knows...

705
01:19:48,725 --> 01:19:51,489
who is Sarah and who is GaëIle.

706
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:54,224
Listen!

707
01:19:54,698 --> 01:19:55,926
Sarah.

708
01:19:56,599 --> 01:19:57,998
What is it?

709
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,826
It's nothing.

710
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:03,536
It's like last time.

711
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,271
Remember.

712
01:20:06,109 --> 01:20:07,872
Screel deen.

713
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:21,450
Papa.

714
01:20:25,962 --> 01:20:27,224
GaëIle?

715
01:20:27,564 --> 01:20:29,054
Is Mama home?

716
01:20:29,265 --> 01:20:32,132
I'll go over to the Vellers' and get her.

717
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,402
I was too late.

718
01:21:23,153 --> 01:21:24,643
My God, Mama!

719
01:21:25,188 --> 01:21:26,951
What have you done?

720
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,283
He wouldn't stop crying.

721
01:21:31,828 --> 01:21:33,659
I couldn't stand it.

722
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:35,461
I had to stop it.

723
01:21:35,532 --> 01:21:37,124
My God, GaëIle!

724
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,998
- What'll we do?
- Calm down.

725
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,937
Mama, go home with Sarah.

726
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:46,906
- No, GaëIle.
- Quiet!

727
01:21:47,243 --> 01:21:48,403
Mama?

728
01:21:49,145 --> 01:21:50,703
Do you hear me?

729
01:21:50,847 --> 01:21:52,576
Do you hear me, Mama?

730
01:21:52,682 --> 01:21:55,082
Go home with Sarah. Right away.

731
01:21:55,185 --> 01:21:57,119
- No, GaëIle.
- Go home.

732
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:59,881
- They'll be home soon.
- I can't leave you.

733
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:02,789
Take Mama home
or they'll put her in an asylum.

734
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:04,793
Is that what you want?

735
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:07,392
They'll put me away.

736
01:22:10,033 --> 01:22:11,330
Why you?

737
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,868
Because I'm the strongest.

738
01:22:18,942 --> 01:22:20,170
GaëIle?

739
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,417
