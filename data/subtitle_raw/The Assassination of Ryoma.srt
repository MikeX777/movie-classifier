1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,300
The Assassination of Ryoma

2
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:42,039
Directed by Kazuo Kuroki

3
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:48,462
November 13, 1867

4
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:29,545
Come up and see me sometime.

5
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,612
Ryoma on the move.

6
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:01,196
Yesterday some guard came from the
Magistrate's office and left this.

7
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,288
Are you dissatisfied?

8
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,251
Whaddya think?

9
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:16,545
Well, it does kind of look like you.

10
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:18,255
Ryoma, wanted for the murder of two

11
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,215
Shogunate Officials
in Teradaya last year

12
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:23,052
They really make me look evil in this thing.

13
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,226
Wanted for murder: Ryoma Sakamoto

14
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,562
We'll I'll be on my way...

15
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:36,398
If there's anything else you
need, please ask Tokichi anytime.

16
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,402
Hey Shinsuke,

17
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:45,407
Why did you take on this kind of work?

18
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,910
I'm just a simple businessman,

19
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,037
although I may not look like it.

20
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,040
The Shogunate is going to collapse.

21
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:56,335
Well, there are many people
that would say the opposite.

22
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:02,508
That's just like you,
Mr. Shinsuke Kendo.

23
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:06,887
There are other ways to make a
profit regardless of the Shogunate.

24
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:11,850
Whatever...

25
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:16,188
We can talk about it again sometime.

26
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,608
I appreciate it.

27
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:02,437
Ryoma, The Peeping Tom

28
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:55,282
Nakaichi Shinsuke,

29
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:57,618
in accordance to the
laws of the Auxilary Guard

30
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:59,578
you are hereby ordered
to commit seppuku.

31
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,923
Control yourself, Shinsuke!

32
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,208
Ryoma Sakamoto...

33
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,292
just arrived.

34
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,585
Really?

35
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:52,339
That is good news.

36
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:07,312
Are you going to kill him?

37
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:10,649
Don't be foolish.

38
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:15,779
He's practically my best friend.

39
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,461
Why do you pretend nothing happened?

40
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:38,552
You know that he
and I were together once

41
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,096
Tai,

42
00:11:58,405 --> 00:11:59,948
Ryoma is a beast!

43
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:04,077
That's actually one of his better qualities

44
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:11,334
Why, Shintaro?

45
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:13,962
Why aren't you more like a beast?

46
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:15,297
Cut it out!

47
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:21,011
Tai,

48
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:22,262
Knock it off!

49
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,191
Later later.

50
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:24,611
I'll pay you afterwards

51
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,742
What's up with you?

52
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,745
Sorry, but this is all I have.

53
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,790
It's only 100 yen. Forgive me.

54
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:44,422
You know times are tough right now.
Even rice costs twice as much,

55
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:48,593
but my salary stays the same.

56
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:52,180
Even farmers have it better than I do.

57
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:54,349
I'm sorry, cut me some slack.

58
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,440
You're worse than the
prostitutes in Shinagawa.

59
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:05,694
Here.

60
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:35,932
C'mon,

61
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,726
Hold it firmly.

62
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:42,856
It's got a kick to it. Hold it right.

63
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,482
Arms straight and stiff.

64
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,192
What the hell is wrong with you?!

65
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,240
Aim it straight in
front of your target.

66
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,660
Arms straight.

67
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:01,708
Now, pull this thing back.

68
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:06,379
Push down hard.

69
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,590
What the hell are you doing?

70
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,050
Like this.

71
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:16,473
Give it here.

72
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:28,526
Seems like a katana
(sword) is still better.

73
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:30,361
Whatever...

74
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:34,824
Strange...

75
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:39,162
Hold this.

76
00:17:58,556 --> 00:17:59,349
Move your feet!

77
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,976
Why don't you help me look?

78
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,062
Don't just sit there!

79
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:13,696
Get your feet outta my face!

80
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,742
Shortsighted Ryoma

81
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:11,087
From Edo to Kyoto, then Kyoto to
Nagasaki, always on the move.

82
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:14,591
A lightweight gun is the best
weapon for someone in my situation.

83
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:17,260
Imagine being on the run for
three days with a heavy sword,

84
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:19,387
your back, arms,
and joints start to ache.

85
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:23,349
I said the same thing to Shinta,
but he's so stubborn.

86
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:26,186
He can't let go of his katana.

87
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:29,480
It's too late for him
to change his ways.

88
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:30,523
Right?

89
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:36,237
For example, if Shinta
and I went to Edo,

90
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:38,865
I would cost him two days of
traveling because of his sword.

91
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,661
While the cherry blossums scatter,
people might change alliances,

92
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:46,581
or your girl could fall
for some other guy.

93
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:47,999
Forget about it!

94
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,258
What the fucks up
with this stupid thing?

95
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,240
It's just like the color of blood.

96
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:22,951
It really is, isn't it?

97
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:38,508
I've heard that Ryoma Sakamoto
has gone into hiding.

98
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:42,553
Wow, you get your information fast.

99
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:47,183
The Bakufun spies are closing in.
So he's got to be somewhere.

100
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:51,104
That may be true,

101
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:54,691
but that is comforting enough.

102
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:58,361
Sakamoto may be a great man, but
he makes stupid mistakes.

103
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:01,698
We can't let him fall into the
hands of the Bakufun.

104
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:02,991
Agreed.

105
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,549
Hanjiro Nakamura.

106
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:25,096
Lately, he has become even more quiet.
Maybe it's because of all the killing.

107
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,453
What's the situation?

108
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:08,389
Nakamura,
the new kid is quite petulant.

109
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:11,934
That petulance is
good enough for the job.

110
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:17,607
Hey!

111
00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:59,524
What a ridiculously long katana.

112
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,328
This stuff isn't used
in Japan nowadays.

113
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,122
Mr. Oyaji, reconsider.

114
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:17,458
If I bought this from you,
I would never be able to resell it.

115
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,252
I can't take it.

116
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,963
Oyaji, please take it.

117
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:25,341
Sorry. Why don't you try
a different pawnshop

118
00:23:25,925 --> 00:23:28,094
Oyaji, just take it.

119
00:24:15,057 --> 00:24:17,185
Stop laughing at me!

120
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:26,147
I told you not to follow me!

121
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:31,611
Captain, you are lost. Would you be
able to kill Ryoma like that?

122
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,031
What?

123
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,702
Failure will cost lives.

124
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:42,496
Ryoma Sakamoto is just that scary.

125
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:45,499
Wasn't that why we moved his
hideout to the warehouse?

126
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:50,755
Avoiding the watchful eyes of the
Shogunate was just a front,

127
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:56,636
we need to keep Sakamoto far away from
the provisional palace, in essence...

128
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:59,722
so that one of us could
kill him at any time.

129
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:02,725
That's why I told you
I was going alone!

130
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:08,147
Ryoma is a very cautious man.
He will only invite me to go inside.

131
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:12,109
It will only be when
I feel like the son of a barber

132
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:17,782
and he feels like the son
of a pawnshop owner again.

133
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:19,075
But..

134
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:22,453
You've said enough!

135
00:27:36,634 --> 00:27:38,302
Mr. Nakaoka

136
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:43,891
I just felt like having
a meal with Ryoma.

137
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,694
Toukichi, make it as you always do.

138
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,636
Stop squirming around!

139
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:57,358
Where are you from?

140
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:01,195
You just won't stop moving.

141
00:30:02,488 --> 00:30:04,156
Where are you from?

142
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:07,827
If you keep moving around
I can't get anything done.

143
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:09,328
So what do you do?

144
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:13,999
A boat. I work on a
boat, just like you.

145
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,087
You're silly. Why would someone
working on a boat be targeted?

146
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:20,297
I wonder why.

147
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:21,507
Anyway, who cares?

148
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:29,723
What now?

149
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:32,184
Well, if you did
actually work on a boat...

150
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:34,520
then it's the same as my family.

151
00:30:34,562 --> 00:30:36,814
My Dad's a fisherman too.

152
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:37,857
Oh yea? Whereabouts?

153
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:39,775
Shimotsui in Seto Bay.

154
00:30:40,192 --> 00:30:41,902
Sure, sure. I know that place.

155
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:44,947
I've been there many times by boat.

156
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:49,034
It had a big port that could fit
two or three steamboats

157
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:55,291
They also had women as gentle
as the sea of Seto.

158
00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:02,256
Pervert, you're really a weirdo.

159
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:07,136
You too. What kind of man would
want a shrew like you?

160
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,600
If I said the word, "Shinsengumi,"

161
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:15,686
would you run away?

162
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:23,861
Well, the captain is usually best at
rowing, so let's start rowing!

163
00:31:28,574 --> 00:31:30,951
To Maiden, my sister,

164
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:37,541
Today I am taking a
chance to write to you,

165
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:41,587
I have spent my days and nights...

166
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:45,424
remembering what you said to me...

167
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:51,096
forgetting one's national
polity over lust

168
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,142
is an insult that
should never happen...

169
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:05,486
But these days I have been overcome...

170
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:09,573
overcome by a strange passion...

171
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:17,247
and it's growing strength
fills me with fear...

172
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:24,838
I know nobody will understand...

173
00:32:27,883 --> 00:32:30,177
Ryoma is confused...

174
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,598
Ryoma is tired...

175
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:37,393
Ryoma...

176
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,438
shits five times a day.

177
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:53,761
So, there was this stupid cat...

178
00:33:55,637 --> 00:34:00,642
that climbed up a tree
and couldn't get down.

179
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:05,898
I called to it and all it would do
is cling to the branch and cry.

180
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,567
I had no choice but to climb up

181
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:12,154
but the cat kept climbing further up.

182
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,907
I shouted at it to stop...

183
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,162
I put some mochi on a
stick to lure it down,

184
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:23,707
I tried everything but nothing worked.

185
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:27,628
If we didn't do something
the cat would starve

186
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:30,255
So I thought and said,

187
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:36,178
Fine! Just cut the damn tree down!

188
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,058
but everyone just started laughing.

189
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:43,102
I said, "What's so funny!"

190
00:34:43,977 --> 00:34:47,356
They said it was stupid to try to

191
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:50,609
cut down a tree that was
ten feet wide for a skinny cat

192
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:54,905
and the moment I heard that,
I started laughing too

193
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,032
It was stupid, wasn't it?

194
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:01,745
The priorities of value
are competely wrong,

195
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,539
don't you agree?

196
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:09,878
I've been told that
I'm a little off in the head

197
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:14,675
At that time, they did have a point,

198
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:19,179
but after awhile I thought to myself,

199
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,974
That's not the point,

200
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:27,604
that it's not about the cat's life,

201
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,941
but more so that it should be
acceptable to at least come up with

202
00:35:31,024 --> 00:35:33,861
the idea of cutting down
the tree to save the cat.

203
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:37,739
Every possibility
should be considered!

204
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:42,286
In other words,
it's how you see things.

205
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:44,037
Viewpoint!

206
00:35:46,123 --> 00:35:50,043
What I'm trying to say is that when
you look at something differently,

207
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:56,425
you have the chance to see
a completely different image,

208
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,847
Sometimes a riddle becomes
all too obvious.

209
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:06,894
Other times you begin to question
something you've always believed

210
00:36:07,352 --> 00:36:10,105
and visa versa!

211
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:15,444
It's a scary thought. Scary!

212
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:22,492
so scary it makes you want to run away

213
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,747
and before you know it...

214
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,374
before you know it...

215
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,737
Who is it?

216
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:12,542
Uta?

217
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,461
Sister.

218
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:22,052
It's been two years! Come in!

219
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:37,359
Who's that?

220
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:40,737
Nobody.

221
00:37:57,713 --> 00:38:03,010
Violence from Left-Wing samurai
is a daily occurrence

222
00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:48,638
Why aren't you eating?

223
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:49,723
It's good.

224
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:57,689
I can't eat the fowl from a man
who tried to kill you.

225
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:58,774
What are you on about?

226
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,526
Shinta is Shinta. Food is food.

227
00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:03,278
Sensei, this is no laughing matter.

228
00:39:04,654 --> 00:39:05,781
I get it!

229
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:10,327
This wasn't the first
time I've been targeted.

230
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,496
It's more like the third or fouth by now.

231
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:17,584
There were two times when I
seriously tried to kill Shinta myself,

232
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:24,383
but as usual, he is a tardy man,

233
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:27,761
and he arrived when I wasn't around.

234
00:39:27,928 --> 00:39:32,057
I bet you, at least carry your
revolver when you go out.

235
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:37,479
Well, I wouldn't really call it going out...

236
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:50,242
Have you lost your mind?

237
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,245
I don't need you testing me!

238
00:39:53,745 --> 00:39:56,790
I apologize. It's just that I'm worried.

239
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:57,582
Well, don't be!

240
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:03,422
People who worry too much will split their balls just stepping out of the bath.

241
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:07,092
Their life will never be fully satifying.

242
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:10,554
Eat!

243
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,528
Ryoma's favorite shoes were purchased

244
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:11,448
from the British Mr.Grover two years ago

245
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:38,725
Ryoma, the long-distance runner,
always accompanied by assassins

246
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:55,325
November 14, 1867

247
00:42:15,512 --> 00:42:20,183
Imperial Court increases breeding
of pigs due to financial hardships

248
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:51,756
Is this chrysanthemum too big?

249
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:55,010
No, that looks just right.

250
00:42:56,094 --> 00:42:58,805
It's very impressive of you, Mr.Iwakura,

251
00:42:59,973 --> 00:43:06,146
to bring out the flag used 500 years
ago during the North-South dynasty.

252
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:09,441
The chrysanthemum symbol is the
best way to get the simple minded,

253
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:12,152
the weirdos, and those
who make excuses,

254
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:14,863
to obey and follow orders.

255
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:21,077
Instead of just one,

256
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:23,997
why don't we go all out,

257
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:29,586
and send one or two hundred of them
to the entire anti-government army.

258
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:32,172
The Satsuma and
Choshu region prepare to

259
00:43:32,297 --> 00:43:37,636
reform a month after the restoration
of the government to the emperor.

260
00:43:51,024 --> 00:43:55,195
Bills are falling from
the sky in Omiya!

261
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:04,204
Money is falling from the sky!

262
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:17,258
Where is the Captain?
I need to see the Captain!

263
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:19,761
Be quiet! I said he's not here!

264
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:20,929
Then Noda will be fine,
let us meet him!

265
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:21,930
Noda isn't here either!
Then Noda will be fine,
let us meet him!

266
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,306
Noda isn't here either!

267
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,476
Nishino, what are
you and Noda planning?

268
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:28,645
Where are you hiding the Captain?

269
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:33,024
If you are going to continue this
insubordination, you will be punished!

270
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,751
What are you waiting for?

271
00:44:53,545 --> 00:44:57,006
If you're going to force me to commit
seppuku, then let me do it now.

272
00:44:57,507 --> 00:45:04,055
Your humor is not appreciated. If you
die now, it will only cause problems.

273
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:05,890
What?

274
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:08,852
You are still considered
to be our Captain.

275
00:45:09,602 --> 00:45:16,693
And will still need you to command
the Tosa Army to fight in the Satsuma-Choshu (Sa-Cho) reformation.

276
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:25,243
Your only weakness is that you
can't kill Mr. Sakamoto.

277
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:30,707
He was not there! How many times
do I have to say it!

278
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:36,045
I know it's uncomfortable,
but please be patient for a while.

279
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:41,926
We don't want Satsuma to look into your
relationship with Sakamoto any further.

280
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:43,803
And then what?

281
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:46,890
you guys will kill Ryoma?

282
00:45:48,433 --> 00:45:54,647
It is our only option as the Tosa
anti-government movement.

283
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:56,357
You're over exaggerating.

284
00:45:58,026 --> 00:46:01,780
Captain, when it comes to Sakamoto you
fully lose your sense of judgement.

285
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:07,994
Look, regardless of how it appears,
the Satsuma are not dependant on Tosa.

286
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:13,958
Even worse, following Sakamoto's
push for non-violent reform,

287
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:17,128
there is a movement to eliminate Tosa.

288
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:21,508
Nonsense. Why would they
need to do such a thing?

289
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:30,225
Simple. Tosa doesn't exist in
the future that Sa-Cho envisions.

290
00:46:33,645 --> 00:46:37,774
That is why no matter how
much shame we endure,

291
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:41,528
we must maintain
obedience towards them.

292
00:46:42,487 --> 00:46:47,200
By any means possible, we must
continue to hold on to that future.

293
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:50,203
You stupid fool!

294
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:55,959
What you see
is just the shifting of power.

295
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:05,093
That is all that matters to me.

296
00:47:06,678 --> 00:47:11,641
If the Bakufu collapses,
what will the next era be like?

297
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:16,312
A bright and shiney new Japan?

298
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:22,193
I don't believe in such things.

299
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:55,101
Captain, if you continue to be
so depressed, it will be bad for you.

300
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:58,730
Here, why don't you have some
of that wine that you like?

301
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:02,609
Tae, if you would.

302
00:49:02,293 --> 00:49:03,127
Uta?

303
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:13,800
I also have an overbearing sister
back home, named Maiden.

304
00:51:15,384 --> 00:51:19,472
She still sends me
these childish letters.

305
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:24,727
Sisters have a strange presence,

306
00:51:27,146 --> 00:51:29,107
they are oddly comforting,

307
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:32,944
and yet that makes them irrisistable.

308
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:39,158
I'm sure if I went back home I would
end up sucking on her breast every day.

309
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:45,748
Why do you carry this thing around?

310
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:51,879
Stop being so impersonal.

311
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,424
Did anything good come from
leaving your home town?

312
00:51:55,925 --> 00:52:00,930
I'm sure with a sword like that nothing
good could have happened to you.

313
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,478
You are the quiet type.

314
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:09,939
You remind me of someone.

315
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,943
Who was it?

316
00:52:19,323 --> 00:52:21,784
Right, it was Izou.

317
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:25,079
You remind me of a friend named Izou.

318
00:52:26,038 --> 00:52:29,250
The way you carry yourself,

319
00:52:29,876 --> 00:52:31,502
your gaze,

320
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:34,797
just like him.

321
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:39,927
He was called, Izou the Murderer

322
00:52:40,178 --> 00:52:45,183
He was really good at killing people,
or more likely, he really enjoyed it.

323
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,605
Anyway, instead of dying in a fight
he was poisoned while he was in jail.

324
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:57,862
You're young but you look like
you're good at killing people too.

325
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:16,339
I don't know who asked him to come,
but that was pitiful.

326
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,042
What are you doing?

327
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:54,460
Is it good?

328
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,606
What's wrong?

329
00:55:08,492 --> 00:55:09,910
Uta, don't do it!

330
00:56:42,795 --> 00:56:44,296
Toukuchi!

331
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:03,357
Shinsuke, give my
apologies to your wife.

332
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:08,195
Sensei, where are you going
dressed like that?

333
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:10,156
Isn't it obvious?

334
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,241
I'm going to see Shinta.

335
00:57:12,908 --> 00:57:14,160
To see Nakaoka?

336
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:21,041
It's great, hiding from my assassins by
blending in with the crowd. Ingenious.

337
00:57:22,126 --> 00:57:25,588
But Nakaoka is one of the assassins.

338
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:27,173
Toukuchi, my shoes.

339
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:31,093
You're wearing leather shoes with that?

340
00:57:31,343 --> 00:57:34,722
You imbecile, stop
talking and get them.

341
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:26,709
The Government of Kyoto
has banned disguises

342
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:34,461
Uta finds an opportunity to kill Ryoma

343
01:01:35,212 --> 01:01:39,550
Throw up some more, you'll feel better.

344
01:02:06,452 --> 01:02:08,787
Calm down, it's just me.

345
01:02:16,128 --> 01:02:17,254
Be quiet.

346
01:02:19,757 --> 01:02:23,343
Where is Shinta?
Here or Myouzen Temple?

347
01:02:25,888 --> 01:02:31,727
What's up with you?
I'm not here to kill Shinta.

348
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:34,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

349
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,192
C'mon, where's Shinta?

350
01:02:40,652 --> 01:02:42,696
Shintaro is going to get killed.

351
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:44,823
What?

352
01:02:45,949 --> 01:02:49,203
He's being held by soldiers in the back

353
01:02:49,578 --> 01:02:55,709
and they will make him commit seppuku
at any moment. Please help him!

354
01:03:04,176 --> 01:03:07,137
You're in love with him?

355
01:03:13,977 --> 01:03:16,855
Hurry, take off your kimono.

356
01:03:18,482 --> 01:03:20,692
I'm saying take off your kimono!

357
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:23,737
You savage!

358
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:45,300
You idiot, it's not like that!

359
01:04:09,575 --> 01:04:11,076
Shinta, it's me!

360
01:04:12,411 --> 01:04:13,912
Look at me!

361
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:19,126
See? It's me!

362
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:27,175
Moron, I'm not here to kill you.

363
01:04:30,888 --> 01:04:32,890
What the hell are you doing?

364
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:34,182
Relax!

365
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:49,341
I don't understand how this happened.

366
01:05:50,759 --> 01:05:53,303
first you are after me,

367
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:56,473
and now your guys are after you,

368
01:05:58,308 --> 01:06:00,435
This is a very strange situation.

369
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:15,575
I've met that kid before.

370
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:17,953
Who is he?

371
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,246
Dunno.

372
01:06:19,705 --> 01:06:20,956
You don't know?

373
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:25,961
The only thing I know is that he tries
to kill me whenever he has the chance.

374
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:30,507
It's him.

375
01:06:32,175 --> 01:06:35,303
I met him at Satsuma's palace.

376
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:40,600
The Satsuma's are
trying to kill me too?

377
01:06:43,562 --> 01:06:44,855
Let's kill him.

378
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:47,024
Wait, wait. We're unarmed.

379
01:06:47,399 --> 01:06:48,942
Where's your revolver?

380
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:54,781
I have it with me
but I forgot to load it

381
01:06:55,407 --> 01:06:58,035
You're pathetic. You
haven't changed a bit.

382
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,748
You're the one who's pathetic, you're
trying to kill me too. Don't worry.

383
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:06,752
But, I can't let it slide.

384
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:09,880
Leave him be, he's not so bad.

385
01:07:10,047 --> 01:07:13,091
I know, but I think I can kill him now.

386
01:07:19,973 --> 01:07:21,224
What's up with him?

387
01:07:42,412 --> 01:07:44,790
Stop it, you two! I'm going to shoot!

388
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:50,212
We need to be careful!

389
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,876
Hit 'im again!

390
01:08:34,756 --> 01:08:36,550
C'mon, samurai, fight back!

391
01:08:43,807 --> 01:08:45,851
What a pretty girl you are.

392
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:22,345
We need to be careful. Let's wait
until dark to return to the warehouse.

393
01:09:24,639 --> 01:09:27,893
Yeah, it will be better
to wait until night.

394
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:33,148
I'm getting sleepy.

395
01:09:36,526 --> 01:09:38,695
Yeah, I'm really sleepy.

396
01:09:58,298 --> 01:09:59,799
What are you doing?

397
01:10:04,888 --> 01:10:06,723
Stop it, old hag.

398
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,448
You fucking moron.

399
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:48,825
Coward!

400
01:11:49,326 --> 01:11:52,579
A completely hopeless case!

401
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:58,877
Why avoid an armed reformation?

402
01:12:00,128 --> 01:12:02,047
So not to shed blood?

403
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:03,840
For the value of human life?

404
01:12:04,424 --> 01:12:06,509
Since when have you become a pacifist?

405
01:12:09,637 --> 01:12:12,432
Besides, I've been meaning to kill you

406
01:12:12,557 --> 01:12:17,228
ever since you started preaching
about that deceitful restoration.

407
01:12:19,522 --> 01:12:23,026
Getting Tokugawa to resign his
position as Shogun,

408
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:28,531
sounds like one of your typical tricks

409
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,495
but it's been a month,
and how has the country changed?

410
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:37,082
We want to get rid of the old system,
we must pull them out from the roots.

411
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:40,335
Start having the Shogun and his family
commit seppuku, or else kill them.

412
01:12:41,336 --> 01:12:46,633
That's reformation. And that is the
only way to create a true reformation.

413
01:12:48,802 --> 01:12:51,596
Don't you understand that?

414
01:12:51,805 --> 01:12:53,765
Of course I do.
- What?

415
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:58,353
I understand it, that's why I'm here, listening to your story.

416
01:12:58,436 --> 01:13:01,439
I don't disagree with anything
you've just said.

417
01:13:01,523 --> 01:13:03,608
So, what are you going to do?

418
01:13:05,443 --> 01:13:06,486
Specifically.

419
01:13:06,986 --> 01:13:08,405
That's not a problem.

420
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:11,241
I'm commanding the Tosa anti-government faction

421
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:14,702
and committing to reformationary
military of the Sa-Cho.

422
01:13:15,036 --> 01:13:18,289
I see, and say you'll destroy the Bakufu?

423
01:13:18,832 --> 01:13:22,085
Don't make it sound like
it's as easy as squashing a bug!

424
01:13:22,752 --> 01:13:26,381
No, I am confident you can destroy
them. No matter what, you'll win.

425
01:13:30,593 --> 01:13:33,263
But the problem is what happens next.

426
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:36,099
Who comes into power then?

427
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:44,732
You sound just like Noda.

428
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:46,151
Really? Just like Noda?

429
01:13:47,777 --> 01:13:50,280
He has no vision for change.

430
01:13:51,156 --> 01:13:54,409
All he's interested in
is who takes control.

431
01:13:55,034 --> 01:13:59,581
Shinta, this is a concern of mine as well,

432
01:13:59,956 --> 01:14:05,003
you destroy the Bakufu and create a
new system. Then who comes next?

433
01:14:06,379 --> 01:14:10,550
what kind of government will he create?
That is what I think about!

434
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,094
I'm more of a realist than you!

435
01:14:15,138 --> 01:14:18,349
and I have painted some
ideas of the future

436
01:14:19,184 --> 01:14:22,562
I have addressed these ideas
to Saigo and Katsura, too.

437
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,983
But then, one day...

438
01:14:27,942 --> 01:14:31,154
I did a handstand...

439
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:35,283
and while doing a handstand,
I looked at the world's movement.

440
01:14:36,326 --> 01:14:39,746
It was a very odd scene
from that viewpoint,

441
01:14:41,581 --> 01:14:44,834
there were all these
power-hungry phantoms!

442
01:14:45,376 --> 01:14:48,630
Wait, Shinta.

443
01:14:49,255 --> 01:14:52,926
I'm not just insulting
my allies for fun,

444
01:14:55,303 --> 01:14:57,597
I'm saying that by doing a handstand,

445
01:14:58,598 --> 01:15:03,645
we can figure out a way to
escape the strong pull of power.

446
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:07,482
Without hiding or running away,

447
01:15:08,107 --> 01:15:10,944
we need to figure out how
to become independent.

448
01:15:13,112 --> 01:15:15,323
Or maybe...

449
01:15:17,492 --> 01:15:22,455
Maybe we need to completely
change our own lives.

450
01:15:29,295 --> 01:15:30,505
Enough!

451
01:15:31,548 --> 01:15:34,509
Enough of this psychotic rant!

452
01:15:35,802 --> 01:15:39,597
You're near-sighted, but you always
speak with such a long stare.

453
01:15:40,473 --> 01:15:42,850
First we need to completely
destroy the old order.

454
01:15:42,934 --> 01:15:46,187
After that the new world will
finally start to reveal itself.

455
01:15:46,312 --> 01:15:49,983
So first, I will become the
destroyer. A thorough destroyer.

456
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,526
That is my only mission!

457
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:52,902
Listen, Shinta!

458
01:15:52,902 --> 01:15:55,738
Shut up! I don't have to
listen to this anymore!

459
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:01,703
Die!

460
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,710
All pigs need to die!

461
01:17:47,642 --> 01:17:51,479
Han! Please run away with me!

462
01:17:55,358 --> 01:17:56,442
Let me go!

463
01:18:07,787 --> 01:18:09,747
Don't be stupid!

464
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:13,209
I'm still young!

465
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:16,129
Running away with an
embezzler like you

466
01:18:17,213 --> 01:18:19,298
wouldn't bring me any joy in life!

467
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:21,426
Leave by yourself!

468
01:18:22,885 --> 01:18:25,888
You are the only thing
I have going for me!

469
01:18:26,723 --> 01:18:29,642
I'd do anything to support you,

470
01:18:29,726 --> 01:18:33,146
I'd become a monk, or even
an apprentice at a pawnshop!

471
01:18:35,398 --> 01:18:38,693
You've fallen pretty far from
your position in the Shinsengumi

472
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:46,743
I said it before, I have no intention
of rotting away with some old bore!

473
01:18:49,287 --> 01:18:51,581
Now, you lazy monk. Get out!

474
01:18:51,789 --> 01:18:52,832
Damn you!

475
01:18:56,627 --> 01:18:57,754
That hurts!

476
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,682
Stop it.

477
01:21:19,312 --> 01:21:20,938
Run away with me

478
01:21:21,647 --> 01:21:22,440
Run away?

479
01:21:24,025 --> 01:21:28,446
I love sleeping with you

480
01:21:30,281 --> 01:21:33,701
I want to rent a house and do this everyday

481
01:21:36,579 --> 01:21:40,458
I want to do this
from morning to night.

482
01:21:43,586 --> 01:21:48,591
You're being inconsiderate!
Stop fidgeting and get out!

483
01:21:49,508 --> 01:21:53,262
I'm fine being inconsiderate.
Feel free to do as you like.

484
01:22:52,905 --> 01:22:57,910
You! Skinny! Cowardly! Potato!
Come down here!

485
01:22:59,495 --> 01:23:01,288
Cut it out!

486
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:19,682
November 15, 1867

487
01:23:26,355 --> 01:23:30,026
See, he's there alright.
And today it's a newcomer.

488
01:23:30,484 --> 01:23:34,030
Just to be safe, I sent my wife
and kid back to the countryside.

489
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:36,449
Thorough as always.

490
01:23:37,074 --> 01:23:42,163
But it appears I may have
made a miscalculation

491
01:23:42,705 --> 01:23:45,958
That doesn't sound like you,

492
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:51,172
as a merchant you must always
be adjusting your calculations.

493
01:23:52,423 --> 01:23:53,549
You have a point.

494
01:24:13,402 --> 01:24:14,278
Wait.

495
01:24:15,446 --> 01:24:17,907
Hold on with the Ryoma Sakamoto case.

496
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:19,075
What do you mean?

497
01:24:19,742 --> 01:24:22,870
No idea. I don't know anything.
These are orders from above.

498
01:24:22,995 --> 01:24:25,081
It was the same thing with
yesterday's Choshu case.

499
01:24:25,206 --> 01:24:29,627
Why are the orders changing like the
eyes of a cat. Screw the orders!

500
01:24:38,344 --> 01:24:39,261
Orders.

501
01:25:06,831 --> 01:25:10,126
I'm sick of being
cooped up in this place!

502
01:25:12,586 --> 01:25:16,841
It feels like my body is
starting to smell like mold.

503
01:25:32,273 --> 01:25:33,607
Damn it!

504
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:38,195
If somebody wants to kill me, do it!

505
01:25:41,157 --> 01:25:41,949
Shinta!

506
01:25:42,533 --> 01:25:46,996
How about you?
Are you going to kill me or not?

507
01:25:48,122 --> 01:25:49,999
Stop eating and get serious!

508
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:55,212
Stop wailing.
You're getting dust in my food.

509
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:00,676
What's with your
high 'n mighty attitude?

510
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:03,345
The best way to eat is sitting comfortably.

511
01:26:03,929 --> 01:26:08,350
No matter how much you act like a
samurai, you're the son of a barbar.

512
01:26:10,644 --> 01:26:13,355
And you are the
son of a pawnshop owner.

513
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,482
That's right, I am.

514
01:26:15,608 --> 01:26:17,902
And why is it that the son of a pawnshop owner,

515
01:26:18,027 --> 01:26:21,197
having been told by a lady to elope,
has to be kept up here?

516
01:26:21,322 --> 01:26:27,036
She's saying she wants to make
love to me the whole day,

517
01:26:27,494 --> 01:26:29,330
Isn't that a wonderful thing?

518
01:26:29,622 --> 01:26:31,040
So why the hell can't I do that!

519
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:33,792
If you want to elope, be my guest.

520
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,212
Alright, I will.

521
01:26:36,837 --> 01:26:38,881
I'll leave this
stinking warehouse today!

522
01:26:42,676 --> 01:26:45,888
Is that what you meant
by changing your life?

523
01:26:47,973 --> 01:26:49,266
I don't know!

524
01:26:49,642 --> 01:26:53,145
I no longer know what is Ryoma and
what is the reformation

525
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:56,440
if my old identity as the son
of a pawnshop owner disappears!

526
01:26:58,484 --> 01:27:01,779
think about why we started this,

527
01:27:01,987 --> 01:27:06,575
it was because of our hate for
the real arrogant samurai.

528
01:27:07,534 --> 01:27:12,539
and now we're trying our best to act
like samurai just to have a meal!

529
01:27:12,581 --> 01:27:13,540
You bastard!

530
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:15,292
Who's the reformation for?!

531
01:27:15,584 --> 01:27:18,045
What we're doing is reformation
for the samurai!

532
01:27:19,797 --> 01:27:22,049
It's truly a joke that the sons of barbars

533
01:27:22,132 --> 01:27:25,052
and pawnshop owners are
fighting for a samurai's reformation!

534
01:27:25,177 --> 01:27:26,512
Stop wailing!

535
01:27:27,096 --> 01:27:28,973
Stop being so arrogant, Shintaro!

536
01:27:34,061 --> 01:27:36,772
Why don't you escape with the girl?

537
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:40,609
Is it because of the assassins outside?

538
01:27:42,778 --> 01:27:44,947
No, it's because of yourself.

539
01:27:45,531 --> 01:27:47,491
It's because of you...

540
01:27:48,075 --> 01:27:54,039
You are the one that is completely
immersed in the reformation movement.

541
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:55,541
Shut up!

542
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:59,336
You don't even understand
anything about women!

543
01:28:02,172 --> 01:28:04,258
Are you talking about Tae?

544
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:09,305
Tae is in love with you.

545
01:28:09,847 --> 01:28:12,016
Wrong! The one that Tae
is really into is you!

546
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:13,684
Don't make a fool of me!

547
01:28:13,809 --> 01:28:15,185
Shut up, you womanizer!

548
01:29:33,389 --> 01:29:35,182
A package arrived from Nagasaki!

549
01:29:35,432 --> 01:29:36,433
Alright! It came!

550
01:29:38,852 --> 01:29:40,312
From Nagasaki?

551
01:29:44,358 --> 01:29:49,363
I ordered 5,000 rifles from Hartmann.

552
01:29:50,072 --> 01:29:53,200
it'll be too late to stock up on
guns after the battle begins.

553
01:29:54,952 --> 01:29:57,704
I was actually thinking of
giving you a few, too

554
01:29:59,498 --> 01:30:02,501
You really are a hopeless case.

555
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:08,006
Maybe.... Maybe I am.

556
01:30:19,143 --> 01:30:22,563
Was there a small
parcel that came with it?

557
01:30:24,773 --> 01:30:25,774
What's wrong?

558
01:30:49,089 --> 01:30:50,424
Fuck.

559
01:30:52,885 --> 01:30:55,762
My 5,000 rifles turned into this.

560
01:30:55,846 --> 01:30:56,889
What do you mean?

561
01:30:57,681 --> 01:31:01,685
He couldn't find the rifles.
So instead, he's giving me this.

562
01:31:11,904 --> 01:31:16,450
Well, there's no point in being glum.
Let's take a photo to change the mood.

563
01:31:18,994 --> 01:31:20,579
Ryoma.

564
01:33:16,486 --> 01:33:18,655
You have to wait ten minutes.

565
01:33:49,311 --> 01:33:53,440
Unfortunately, that picture
no longer survives today

566
01:34:12,834 --> 01:34:15,629
Tonight, I'm going to Nagasaki.

567
01:34:16,254 --> 01:34:17,255
To Nagasaki?

568
01:34:18,674 --> 01:34:20,801
I can get away in the middle of night

569
01:34:21,385 --> 01:34:22,844
And then what will you do?

570
01:34:24,805 --> 01:34:29,810
Even if I can only find 100 or 200,
I'm going to supply the rifles.

571
01:34:31,353 --> 01:34:32,479
And then,

572
01:34:33,772 --> 01:34:37,651
I'm going to reconstruct the navy.

573
01:34:38,735 --> 01:34:39,736
Reconstruct?

574
01:34:41,196 --> 01:34:43,573
I'm going to recruit a ton
of monks and fishermen.

575
01:34:43,907 --> 01:34:45,242
They'll be useless.

576
01:34:45,325 --> 01:34:46,576
You don't know that!

577
01:34:47,327 --> 01:34:50,914
With good training you can learn using
a gun even when you're no samurai.

578
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:52,958
But even if you do that,

579
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:56,503
you're not going to make it for the
battle Sa-Cho are planning next month.

580
01:34:59,131 --> 01:35:00,841
I know.

581
01:35:01,883 --> 01:35:07,597
That's why I'm going to leave it up
to the Bakufu to destroy the Sa-Cho

582
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:09,599
Leave it up?

583
01:35:09,683 --> 01:35:10,892
That's right,

584
01:35:12,144 --> 01:35:19,192
and after that, my newly formed and
well-trained navy will come into play.

585
01:35:19,901 --> 01:35:21,445
What do you mean?

586
01:35:22,696 --> 01:35:24,656
We'll attack Sa-Cho.

587
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:37,002
Of course, it will be one
ambush after another.

588
01:35:37,252 --> 01:35:39,838
I know we can't go against them head on.

589
01:35:41,423 --> 01:35:45,260
Their forces add
up to be 3 or 4 thousand.

590
01:35:46,261 --> 01:35:50,474
In that case, I can make my move
with 800 to 1,000 men.

591
01:35:51,725 --> 01:35:55,187
Satsuma will definately target you.

592
01:35:57,355 --> 01:35:59,149
By the way, Shinta,

593
01:36:01,485 --> 01:36:02,861
What are you going to do?

594
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:08,742
I can't keep company
with your pipe dream

595
01:36:10,076 --> 01:36:12,829
You will act along with Sa-Cho?

596
01:36:19,628 --> 01:36:22,172
I understand,
both as enemy and as friend.

597
01:36:24,257 --> 01:36:26,635
It's OK. Do as you want to.

598
01:36:29,638 --> 01:36:32,599
But no matter how long you stay here,

599
01:36:33,308 --> 01:36:37,813
you're only going
to start growing mold.

600
01:36:41,525 --> 01:36:44,486
Escape with me tonight,

601
01:36:45,195 --> 01:36:47,030
kill Noda,

602
01:36:47,447 --> 01:36:50,742
and ensure the
Auxiliary troops to our side.

603
01:36:51,243 --> 01:36:52,994
I don't need concern
from a man like you,

604
01:36:53,787 --> 01:36:56,540
someone who has
lost all sense of reality.

605
01:36:59,042 --> 01:37:04,881
I'll eventually just take the
Auxiliary troops with you in it.

606
01:37:05,382 --> 01:37:06,383
You bastard!

607
01:37:07,592 --> 01:37:09,594
Don't be mad!

608
01:37:22,357 --> 01:37:23,525
Let's have a drink.

609
01:37:26,152 --> 01:37:29,698
After tonight, we'll
be apart for awhile.

610
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:41,459
Damn it, I think I caught a cold.

611
01:38:46,191 --> 01:38:47,442
Hey, you drunk.

612
01:38:49,736 --> 01:38:52,739
Stop waving that murder knife around.

613
01:38:52,948 --> 01:38:54,532
What the hell
are you doing, woman!

614
01:39:28,525 --> 01:39:30,860
It looks like there
are swarms out there.

615
01:39:40,286 --> 01:39:42,831
This place is no good for my cold.

616
01:39:46,543 --> 01:39:48,712
Let's go to the
2nd floor of the main wing.

617
01:39:48,837 --> 01:39:50,005
Don't be stupid.

618
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,759
the spies and assassins are all
focused on this place

619
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:56,928
We can't escape.

620
01:39:58,138 --> 01:40:02,559
If we go to the main wing
it will be easier to escape later.

621
01:40:08,398 --> 01:40:10,692
What'll you do with the woman?

622
01:40:20,452 --> 01:40:23,538
She looks like she's fast asleep.

623
01:40:24,581 --> 01:40:26,791
A strangely warm woman.

624
01:41:32,732 --> 01:41:34,609
It looks like we can escape.

625
01:41:34,734 --> 01:41:35,527
Wait.

626
01:41:35,527 --> 01:41:35,652
Later in the night will be safer.
Wait.

627
01:41:35,652 --> 01:41:38,655
Later in the night will be safer.

628
01:42:13,731 --> 01:42:15,400
Where is he?

629
01:42:18,403 --> 01:42:19,654
Gone.

630
01:42:20,822 --> 01:42:24,242
He disappeared right from under me.

631
01:42:26,494 --> 01:42:27,954
Let's run away.

632
01:42:28,746 --> 01:42:31,624
Why should run away with you?

633
01:42:34,711 --> 01:42:36,838
If we don't kill him,

634
01:42:38,047 --> 01:42:40,842
you and I are both going to be killed.

635
01:42:41,634 --> 01:42:42,677
Me too?

636
01:42:42,677 --> 01:42:42,760
Yes
Me too?

637
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,929
Yes

638
01:42:45,889 --> 01:42:47,098
You too.

639
01:42:51,603 --> 01:42:55,190
Well then, Uta...

640
01:42:56,357 --> 01:42:58,443
Kill that man.

641
01:43:00,445 --> 01:43:04,490
No way. I can't do it.

642
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:09,412
What's wrong? Are you scared?

643
01:43:10,496 --> 01:43:16,502
You never told me, but...
Killing is your job, right?

644
01:43:17,962 --> 01:43:23,843
Why can't you kill that man?
Is he an exception?

645
01:43:23,843 --> 01:43:24,761
Stop!

646
01:43:40,902 --> 01:43:42,904
I can't do it.

647
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:56,459
What?

648
01:43:57,502 --> 01:43:59,003
Okamoto, from the Palace?

649
01:44:00,004 --> 01:44:04,926
Yes, with Minekichi from
a bookstore he goes to,

650
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:07,679
visiting the soldiers on the front lines.

651
01:44:08,596 --> 01:44:09,472
Fishy.

652
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:12,225
Just the two of 'em?

653
01:44:14,394 --> 01:44:15,311
Let them in.

654
01:44:19,107 --> 01:44:21,985
Don't drop your guard.

655
01:44:58,354 --> 01:45:00,857
In those final moments,
what did you talk about?

656
01:46:12,095 --> 01:46:13,304
Leaving already?

657
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:17,600
See Mr. Ryoma healthy and
safe is more than enough.

658
01:46:18,101 --> 01:46:21,312
I'm OK, but I caught a cold.

659
01:46:23,481 --> 01:46:28,528
I got the shivers. Why don't we
eat some foul stew?

660
01:46:30,738 --> 01:46:31,906
Foul stew?

661
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:35,034
Don't be picky.

662
01:46:40,248 --> 01:46:41,541
Toukuchi!

663
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:46,045
Sensei, I can get you some foul,
if that's what you want.

664
01:46:46,629 --> 01:46:48,047
Alright, you go get it.

665
01:46:49,507 --> 01:46:51,342
Please be careful.

666
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:10,403
You'll get stiff shoulders
doubting others all the time.

667
01:47:10,528 --> 01:47:11,279
But...

668
01:47:12,196 --> 01:47:16,409
You were completely
defenseless toward me.

669
01:47:17,285 --> 01:47:20,788
I can't even count how
many times I could have killed you.

670
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:25,543
What's with you?

671
01:47:26,794 --> 01:47:29,672
Are you still thinking about killing me?

672
01:47:31,883 --> 01:47:34,051
I am an enemy and an ally.

673
01:47:34,677 --> 01:47:36,179
No, that's no good.

674
01:47:37,305 --> 01:47:43,144
When you start saying those things,
I get the urge to kill you too.

675
01:47:44,353 --> 01:47:47,690
You are too scary
to have as an enemy.

676
01:47:51,194 --> 01:47:54,238
Let's not let go of our swords.

677
01:49:37,883 --> 01:49:40,928
What's with the damn chanting?!

678
01:51:14,188 --> 01:51:17,024
The man you're looking for
is in the main wing.

679
01:51:43,259 --> 01:51:44,635
Where are you going?

680
01:51:48,931 --> 01:51:51,892
I'm going to take
that girl to Nagasaki.

681
01:51:52,226 --> 01:51:53,394
Are you kidding?

682
01:51:55,563 --> 01:51:59,024
You're giving up
your pipe dream for a girl?

683
01:52:03,529 --> 01:52:05,614
That girl is also the daughter
of a fisherman.

684
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:06,741
So what?

685
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:09,702
I'll make her cook for my new navy.

686
01:52:09,702 --> 01:52:11,495
What?

687
01:52:13,831 --> 01:52:15,124
Don't get agitated.

688
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:17,835
I don't know!

689
01:52:19,754 --> 01:52:22,256
but I think my pipe dream

690
01:52:22,590 --> 01:52:24,633
would expand

691
01:52:26,343 --> 01:52:29,305
if I incorporated women like her.

692
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:30,347
I dunno.

693
01:52:34,477 --> 01:52:35,478
You bastard!

694
01:52:39,857 --> 01:52:41,734
You are a complete moron!

695
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:47,740
in that case, take me...

696
01:52:56,499 --> 01:53:00,085
What did you just say?

697
01:53:04,507 --> 01:53:05,758
Idiot!

698
01:53:10,596 --> 01:53:14,433
I'm saying that you should take me.

699
01:53:29,073 --> 01:53:30,241
Are you...

700
01:53:33,244 --> 01:53:37,373
Are you saying you'll be
a part of my pipe dream?

701
01:53:59,603 --> 01:54:00,729
Who is it?

702
01:54:02,356 --> 01:54:03,399
