1
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:39,108
There was a time
when some gutter folk

2
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,471
would give you shit.

3
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:44,046
Think he's a big man,.

4
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,711
Then he gets this funny little half smile

5
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,376
when you shove a gun in his mouth

6
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,793
and tell him, "That's funny,
let's hear another one."

7
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,331
It got his attention and everything else

8
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,623
he's got around your finger.

9
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:02,252
And you don't hear shit no
more when you come collecting.

10
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,084
I don't hold a gun no more.

11
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:06,917
Not like that.

12
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:07,750
Yo!

13
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:11,437
I pack and I wax my Tommy,

14
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:13,549
but it don't get no use.

15
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:22,422
It's not the same.

16
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,095
A used gun and something there to remind

17
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,678
you of what's gone.

18
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:30,834
I felt this city's winter
on my knuckles for 65 years.

19
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,460
Makes you wonder what else is out there.

20
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:55,021
- Just a minute!

21
00:03:58,785 --> 00:03:59,786
Hang on!

22
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:13,679
- You're here for your tribute I presume?

23
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,807
- Did you talk to the guy?

24
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:16,235
- He thought I was a
different Lou or something,

25
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,023
I don't know.

26
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,856
It's been 15 years,

27
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:21,052
I didn't know he retired.

28
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,026
Bad heart.

29
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:22,924
He gave me his sons card.

30
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,223
He said he'll take care of it.

31
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,999
They're not gonna suspend your license,

32
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,962
but they're not gonna give it back to you

33
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:30,223
until you see a judge.

34
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:32,412
- What am I supposed to do until then?

35
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:34,506
- Why don't you try slowing down?

36
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,565
- What, like I'm out enjoying myself?

37
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:39,301
I can't depend on the boss and cabs.

38
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,780
It's just not the best month.

39
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,520
Joey's not paying for shit.

40
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,426
I'm working nights, I
don't know what to do.

41
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,686
- How much I owe ya for the food?

42
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:50,318
I need a grand.

43
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:51,792
- You and me both sweetheart.

44
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,851
So how's Michael?

45
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:54,851
- A handful.

46
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:57,624
Can't find anyone to
watch him after school

47
00:04:57,624 --> 00:04:59,896
since I started this second shift.

48
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,962
Ma's in Florida.

49
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,585
Latchkey kids are good for nothing.

50
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,752
- So why don't you ask me?

51
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:10,676
- You want me to ask you?

52
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:14,456
- I don't know, why don't you ask me?

53
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:15,706
- I don't know.

54
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:19,093
Wednesday, a couple of
hours in the afternoon?

55
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:20,057
You all right with that?

56
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:22,724
- Yeah, I'm all right with that.

57
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,166
Aren't you gonna stay for the turkey?

58
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,150
I wish, I can't.

59
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,983
- Okay.

60
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:29,949
- Thanks for calling the guy.

61
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,645
- Okay honey.

62
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:32,478
Bye.

63
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:33,311
- See you Wednesday.

64
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,144
- Okay.

65
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:41,305
My little girl.

66
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:42,688
She spends all my money then breaks my

67
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:45,152
freaking balls for not having any.

68
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:46,569
She's divorced to some jack-off

69
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,898
two-bit half a wiseguy out of Cicero.

70
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:54,007
I wonder about those clowns
from the Cicero crew.

71
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,674
Yeah, but she talks to me again.

72
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:00,683
You get two families in this line of work.

73
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:04,066
Before too long, your family
become your other family.

74
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,663
And then your other
family becomes your life.

75
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:10,026
And then, it's not even yours anymore.

76
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:17,701
- Hey.

77
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:20,715
How's war counselor?

78
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:26,891
How's everything on the outside today?

79
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:29,725
Mild with
a cold front on the way.

80
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:30,896
- Good.

81
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,864
This is for the Chinese

82
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:35,402
- Yes and no Mr. D'Agnostino.

83
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:37,596
The city's rather vocal
clean sweep initiative

84
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:38,821
is in full swing now

85
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:41,467
and plus the indictments
handed out tomorrow.

86
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,398
These are federal regarding tax fraud and

87
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:47,483
one's going to your
friend in construction.

88
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,502
The labor leader.

89
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:51,262
Concerned about the thing from '91.

90
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,718
- We took care of that in '91.

91
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:55,039
- If the feds can procure testimony,

92
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,948
it'll make their racketeering case and

93
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:01,053
there's way of knowing
what our friend might say.

94
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,743
With him as a turncoat witness,

95
00:07:03,743 --> 00:07:06,060
you could be looking at 25.

96
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,893
- 20...

97
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:08,784
25?

98
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,448
Do I look like I got 25 in me?

99
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,341
- You can still sign on the dotted line.

100
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,684
Keep it in the single
digits and end this now.

101
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,318
A plea bargain is still an option...

102
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:20,485
- You know how many fucking
times I gotta tell you?

103
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,460
I don't cut no fucking deals.

104
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,043
I stand trial, like my old man.

105
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:29,857
Have you had a good meal recently?

106
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:32,201
Have you had a good meal recently?

107
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,480
'Cause here's what I recommend.

108
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,724
You go to our club and you
talk to our friend there,

109
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:37,013
let him know we spoke.

110
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,680
You make sure he realizes
every little thing

111
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:44,224
is gonna be taken care of.

112
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:48,117
What, do you think I'm gonna sit here now?

113
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,700
I'm gonna agree to stand trial?

114
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,802
I see before me here the table's clear.

115
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:57,135
I'll never sign.

116
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,489
- I understand.

117
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:02,835
- And Angelo,

118
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,102
every fucking one of 'em.

119
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:18,970
Stefano's gone inside.

120
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,064
Used to be it was blood or
number two got the bump up.

121
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:24,995
Now it's the big talk and bigger ideas.

122
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:28,074
No respect or history, no nothing.

123
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,417
There was a time it
was me, Sammy, Stefano,

124
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,882
and Frankie knocking over
the collection plate.

125
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:35,799
Now, Sammy's number two

126
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,807
and I'm eating his shit every fucking day.

127
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,998
Look who decided to show up.

128
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,278
- Nothing I could do.

129
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:45,797
Construction.

130
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:48,800
Bumper to bumper for two freaking hours.

131
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,922
- Only two seasons in this fucking city,

132
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,922
winter and construction.

133
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,995
- If there are any issues,

134
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,743
now would be the time Mr. Galante.

135
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,076
- One guy, sure.

136
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,216
But three all-stars for 80 large,

137
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:07,867
I mean, come on, you're giving
me gangbanger prices here.

138
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:10,416
And believe me when I tell you my friend,

139
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,939
this ain't a job for no
fucking Mullen Johns.

140
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:18,803
- I trust 80,000 and
Stefano's graces will suffice?

141
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,722
- Understood.

142
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:23,820
I just don't have anyone working

143
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,472
these prices right now.

144
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:29,271
- We hear anything from Cicero yet?

145
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:32,024
- I tell you anything from Cicero yet?

146
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:34,107
When I know, you'll know.

147
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:38,485
- Somebody's gotta straighten him out.

148
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:40,748
This is family shit
we're talking about here.

149
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,248
Fuck the politics.

150
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,863
Who's Lorenzo looking out for anyway?

151
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:49,707
- I'm only gonna tell you this once,

152
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:52,253
watch your fucking mouth

153
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:55,033
You wanna talk shit, be smart about it.

154
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,714
Now don't make me bring this up again.

155
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:59,846
Bunch of nagging fucks.

156
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:03,596
No wonder all you
Marazano's are divorced?

157
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,465
- Guys, let's go.

158
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,133
All right.

159
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:35,803
Listen up here, all of ya.

160
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,651
Big month guys.

161
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:43,796
We got ourselves a contract
bigger than Asian cock.

162
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:46,317
We're all gonna have to
suck it just a little bit.

163
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:49,478
Old man goes on trial soon,

164
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:52,481
you can bet he's gonna want a clean house,

165
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,564
let's keep him very very happy, okay?

166
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:58,641
All right, now get the fuck out of here.

167
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,014
Let me count my money.

168
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:02,097
You got it boss.

169
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,129
- Enz, you got a minute?

170
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:24,678
- Sure, why not?

171
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:30,363
- That work you were talking
about with our friend?

172
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:34,740
- You think you wanna give it to me?

173
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,221
I got some shit I gotta take care of,

174
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:38,471
I could use the extra cash.

175
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,549
- Lou,

176
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:42,915
this here's a younger man's job

177
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,528
and it don't pay shit.

178
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,772
Besides, you ain't done a hit since 1986.

179
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,439
It's just not smart.

180
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:52,664
Don't worry, I'll find ya something.

181
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,481
I think we're done here.

182
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,374
Most of these punks
don't know their history.

183
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:12,877
Not Enzo.

184
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,554
Can't forget the shit we
used to put him through.

185
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:18,715
Big man, still bitter after 10s of years.

186
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:19,857
Wanna get in?

187
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,367
You wanna get your cut?

188
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,269
You get put through the
wringer every fucking day

189
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,679
until you accept that's the system

190
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,012
it used to be and it worked.

191
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:34,473
- Frankies getting out again.

192
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,100
I guess it's gonna be a party

193
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,780
- Frank Salerno's had
more welcome back parties

194
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,697
than fucking birthdays.

195
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,993
Don't let it bother you Lou.

196
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:52,847
You don't want it.

197
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,465
- Why not somebody a little more seasoned?

198
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,310
I don't even mean me.

199
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,367
If Stefano were giving out the interest...

200
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,380
- But he ain't.

201
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,188
Everything changes Lou.

202
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:07,188
And fuck you for thinking otherwise.

203
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:11,037
When the old man starts
giving out the good stuff,

204
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:14,114
Lorenzo knows where to send it

205
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:15,864
- Lorenzo eats alone.

206
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:40,547
- We're closed pal.

207
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:41,921
Yeah?

208
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,587
Well if you wanna be open tomorrow,

209
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:45,461
I think we should talk.

210
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:48,287
It's a very dangerous
neighborhood you know?

211
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,169
We all gotta look out for each other.

212
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,002
Insurance.

213
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,452
In case anything should
ever happen, you know?

214
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,158
- You're not gonna squeeze me.

215
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:59,491
And your gramps, he ain't scary anymore.

216
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:13,892
- You don't pay your street
tax, you get fucked up.

217
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:15,225
You hear me guy?

218
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,153
- Yeah.

219
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:43,025
Tiger cage, three o'clock sharp.

220
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,775
- Is there a problem?

221
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,663
- Look at that one there.

222
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,369
- What's the deal Sammy?

223
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:15,565
I got this shit on my TV.

224
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:18,148
- Lorenzo's giving you the bit.

225
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,323
- Yeah?

226
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,132
- It's yours.

227
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:27,812
But I gotta ask, why you
wanna do this all the sudden?

228
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:28,812
- I don't know, I just,

229
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:30,817
I figured I'd get away.

230
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,734
Start up somewhere new.

231
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,497
Maybe Vegas.

232
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:36,330
- Vegas?

233
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,502
It's fucking like 120
degrees in the summer there.

234
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:41,662
- But it's dry heat.

235
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:42,849
- Yeah, so is a fucking oven

236
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:45,212
but I don't see you climbing inside one.

237
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,642
- Thought you old-timers
retire to Florida?

238
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:49,892
- Fuck Florida.

239
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:52,970
- Here.

240
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,451
The old man wants 'em done one at a time.

241
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:00,534
First one's by Wednesday.

242
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:04,532
Enzo wants you to send 'em on vacation.

243
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:05,865
Some place warm.

244
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:12,134
You ready to get your hands dirty?

245
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:14,884
- Never clean in the first place.

246
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:37,044
I don't have any delusions of status.

247
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,877
Things go wrong, hey, you cheated.

248
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,357
I take the fall, I go away.

249
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:44,774
I stay forgotten.

250
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:12,370
I need a fucking drink.

251
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,353
I need the money.

252
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,386
- Hello, you guys ready?

253
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:27,886
- Yeah, she'll take the filet.

254
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,702
Miss?

255
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:42,600
- Yeah.

256
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,433
Yeah I'm sorry.

257
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,213
Could you repeat that please?

258
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,429
- Seen here, a local 397 representative

259
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:50,507
and suspected Chicago
Outfit member Joe Barbone

260
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:52,113
was brought in for questioning on

261
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,531
federal charges of income tax evasion

262
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,515
and misuse of union pension funds

263
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:59,503
back through the early 90s.

264
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,334
- I just wanna get this
confusion cleaned up

265
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,789
so that I can get back to work

266
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,701
as Labor Leader for
Chicago's union workers.

267
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,583
As follows,
the District Attorney's...

268
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,416
- Hey.

269
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:14,707
- Still need?

270
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,275
- I've been called worse.

271
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,015
- Got a light?

272
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:24,265
- Not since 98.

273
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,077
- That's pretty committed.

274
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:31,244
- I still get shaky from time to time.

275
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,749
- Need a new wick or
you just out of fluid?

276
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:41,506
- You're still a ball buster Lorraine.

277
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:42,673
Gotta ease up.

278
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:49,107
- What brings you around Lou?

279
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:52,980
Down on your luck a little?

280
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,679
Thought maybe you'd come by at close,

281
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,876
take me home with you?

282
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:00,630
- What are you doing Wednesday
night at eight o'clock?

283
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,547
- You're looking at it.

284
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:06,128
What do you have planned?

285
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,408
- Still working on it.

286
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,761
You still over there near
the side of the river?

287
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:11,594
- Yup.

288
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:14,377
- How's parking over there?

289
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,981
Am I gonna have a problem finding a spot?

290
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:25,760
- Things really don't change, do they?

291
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,593
You know,

292
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,729
I read the person you are at 30,

293
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:33,297
is the person you are for
the rest of your life.

294
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:38,077
- You didn't know me at 30.

295
00:19:39,453 --> 00:19:40,953
- I could imagine.

296
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:37,575
- Hey, what are you doing?

297
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,408
What are you doing?

298
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:39,241
Get down.

299
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:41,980
Come on.

300
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,397
That's dangerous.

301
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,891
- I just wanna hold it.

302
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:47,724
Does that look like something

303
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:50,509
your mother would let you hold?

304
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:53,038
She's gonna be here soon.

305
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:54,288
15 minutes ago.

306
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:57,516
- She's always late.

307
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:58,927
I hate her.

308
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,851
- Michael, don't ever let me hear you

309
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:03,745
disrespect your mother again.

310
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:04,887
You understand me?

311
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:06,379
Otherwise, you're gonna get a slap

312
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:08,362
like you never had before.

313
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:11,362
Now just sit down and be a good boy.

314
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:24,567
You know what this is?

315
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,984
This is a Chicago Typewriter.

316
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:31,938
The whole city was written down
with this thing right here.

317
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,271
This is respect.

318
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,296
- Can I hold it?

319
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:42,325
- You think you can lift it?

320
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:51,329
Okay, you can lift it.

321
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,209
- Does it work?

322
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,042
- No, it's an antique.

323
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:06,487
- What, do you think you're dangerous now?

324
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,513
Not a fucking word about this.

325
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:13,346
Go ahead.

326
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:20,376
You forgot where I lived.

327
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:22,497
- Red line's a disaster.

328
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:23,414
- Okay pal.

329
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:26,379
Let's see ya.

330
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:28,956
Be good.

331
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:29,811
- Thanks again Lou.

332
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:30,725
- Bye Annie.

333
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,558
Be careful.

334
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,391
- Okay.

335
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,804
They can't stop
the flood of memories

336
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:49,509
when it starts to rain.

337
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,077
You either fight to get dry

338
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:53,744
or you let it pour all over you.

339
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,392
You let your hands idle enough

340
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:02,764
and you start to notice how much

341
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:05,431
blood's built up over the years.

342
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:11,019
And nothing's gonna wash
them off but a fresh start.

343
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:35,510
- Next thing I knew,

344
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,191
I put you all over the south side,

345
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:40,835
pulling that crackers
tooth out of my glove.

346
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:44,933
That's a good one Eddie.

347
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:47,074
What happened to him, I forget?

348
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:50,335
- Who gives a fuck what happened to him?

349
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,441
I'm staring at a ghost here.

350
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:53,608
- You miss me?

351
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,809
- New plates, new paint.

352
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,392
You'll be driving good
in this for a while.

353
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,166
- I need a piece too.

354
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,846
Nothing that's gonna jam.

355
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:12,127
What?

356
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:14,833
- I'm not worrying
about the piece jamming.

357
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,558
Man, what are you thinking?

358
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,811
Crazy and stupid's a
young punks line of work.

359
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:24,461
You trying to get back a
piece of the glory days Lou?

360
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:26,453
Well, you may as well forget about it

361
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:30,036
'cause believe me, the
glory days are over.

362
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:35,266
- I got two grand here,
you want it or you don't?

363
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:21,610
It's all right?

364
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,233
- Yeah, it's all right.

365
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,180
Give me a hand here.

366
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,430
This fat fuck weighs a ton.

367
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:31,864
Flush his ashes down the toilet.

368
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:34,614
- I give him first taste of hell.

369
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,444
The beauty of Chinatown,

370
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,631
body never found.

371
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:56,792
Secrets never heard.

372
00:26:56,792 --> 00:27:00,871
And that's how I know the
evening went off without a hitch.

373
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,849
So it's back to the
day I wasn't there for,

374
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:06,071
and the piece of pavement
outside Lorraine's apartment

375
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,821
that I call an alibi.

376
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:14,906
I should start appreciating her more.

377
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:16,489
Maybe some flowers.

378
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:49,141
- Can't see shit.

379
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:53,278
Rough morning hey?

380
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:54,508
- You start with me this early,

381
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,820
you're gonna see a rough
morning you wouldn't believe.

382
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,432
What are we looking at?

383
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,276
- We got another one of these guys.

384
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:04,770
Crime lab's here, body has been removed.

385
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,023
As far as I know, this alley is clean.

386
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:08,838
- We got a nine millimeter
slug in the wall over here.

387
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:09,867
No splatter.

388
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,472
Based on the trajectory,
I'd place the shooter

389
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,000
at 5'8, 5'9.

390
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,475
Looks like the victim was urinating.

391
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,051
We're getting the dirt below checked out.

392
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,968
Don't step in it Ralph.

393
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:20,213
Shooter fires again.

394
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:21,586
Judging from the splatter, I'd say that it

395
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:23,221
was a jugular shot and I place the victim

396
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:25,719
height at 5'10, six foot.

397
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:28,938
Shooter drags the victim out
of the alley, into the street.

398
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:31,346
We got a male boot print
size 10 over there.

399
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:33,349
Then puts him in the trunk and backs out.

400
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:34,472
We have tire tracks and the blood.

401
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,853
The lab's already on it.

402
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:37,158
- How long on the blood?

403
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:38,383
- Without a body to match DNA,

404
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,386
it's only gonna tell us who it's not.

405
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,666
Either way it's gonna take a better part

406
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:42,880
of a week for analysis.

407
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,548
- So the shooter hits
him on the second ya?

408
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,405
Maybe we got a witness out there.

409
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:57,813
- Have Streets and Sand come through

410
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,038
and clean all this up when you're

411
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,121
done playing crime scene.

412
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:16,235
So how'd our date go?

413
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:18,134
- It was all right.

414
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:19,301
You were late.

415
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,539
The roast wasn't done yet

416
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,539
but I still gave you shit all night.

417
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,879
Dinner was delicious, you
didn't shut up about it.

418
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:33,244
We drank wine and we
talked until the morning.

419
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:34,411
- Sounds nice.

420
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:37,728
- I thought so.

421
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,500
- Come on, I'm all shaved.

422
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,994
- And what if I'm not?

423
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:51,744
- I'll grab a beer and I'll wait.

424
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,008
- You are all charm, you know that?

425
00:29:57,475 --> 00:30:00,601
I'd like to see that
quality on a real date.

426
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:02,380
I don't think I have.

427
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,130
So it would be quite the evening.

428
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:08,903
- You remember that time...

429
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,290
- Yeah.

430
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,885
- Give me a minute, I'll remember.

431
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:17,202
- Yeah, but I won't.

432
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:19,770
And besides, I'm not in the habit

433
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,687
of putting out two nights in a row.

434
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:24,931
- Really?

435
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,910
You left that part out.

436
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,032
- Well it's not something that works

437
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,365
its way into a conversation.

438
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,813
Especially the way we did it.

439
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,254
Now go to your boys.

440
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:56,582
- Good morning ma'am.

441
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:59,112
Is there a Dolores M.
Russo that lives here?

442
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:00,901
- Who the fuck wants to know?

443
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,247
- We recovered a black Lexus

444
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:03,855
at a crime scene this morning ma'am.

445
00:31:03,855 --> 00:31:05,766
The vehicle was registered
to Dolores Russo...

446
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:08,129
- What makes you think it's hers?

447
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:09,307
Come back when you got a warrant

448
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:11,216
you sons of bitches.

449
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:15,443
- It's registered to Dolores
Russo at this address.

450
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:17,693
Now you mind if we come in?

451
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:24,704
- Joe's got all that
shit in my mothers name.

452
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:26,084
She's upstairs if you want,

453
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,607
but she doesn't remember much these days.

454
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,257
- When's the last time you saw Joe?

455
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:32,323
- A few nights ago, why?

456
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,735
- So your husband's been
in the papers lately,

457
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:38,135
you think of any enemies
Joe might have had.

458
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:41,816
Anything involving his
recent legal issues?

459
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,399
- Joe doesn't tell me anything.

460
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,212
I knew he must be in some kind of shit.

461
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:49,879
He sent me flowers, the asshole.

462
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:53,403
He never sends me flowers.

463
00:31:58,113 --> 00:32:01,284
- I guess the card would
be asking too much.

464
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,657
Never sends you flowers?

465
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:03,490
- No.

466
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,974
He never sends me flowers.

467
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,180
Are we done?

468
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,053
- It's been a pleasure ma'am.

469
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:19,860
Joey Barbone.

470
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,716
10 will get you 20 we never find him.

471
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:25,599
Take me up, I could use the money.

472
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,913
Think about it.

473
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,314
He's under federal investigation,

474
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:30,002
he got it up the ass so hard
- You got a stop sign.

475
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:31,123
he got a concussion.

476
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:34,239
- D'Agnostino's facing trial next month.

477
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,323
It's time to clean house.

478
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,732
It's Flower Man shit.

479
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:37,732
- It's what?

480
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:39,755
- What year were you born?

481
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:40,784
60?

482
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:41,701
- No, 1972.

483
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,416
- I'm not even gonna tell you what

484
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:47,043
I got in my house older than you.

485
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:48,294
You never heard of the Flower Man?

486
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:49,127
- No.

487
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:51,898
- The late 80s saw lawyers putting

488
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:54,421
the heat on trash like D'Agnostino.

489
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:55,254
Weird shit.

490
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:58,288
Bodies turning up everywhere.

491
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,315
Then there's the Flower Man.

492
00:33:00,315 --> 00:33:03,549
The shit written about this guy.

493
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,425
We knew he was from a 31st street crew.

494
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:08,416
- So what did you do?

495
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,679
- For about a year, year and a half

496
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,514
we had this string of squeaky
clean gangland murders

497
00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:14,778
tighter than a Korean snatch.

498
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:16,725
And corresponding
statements from the widows

499
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:19,821
that day that their husbands
had sent 'em flowers.

500
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:21,488
Flowers, all of 'em.

501
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:25,502
One's a coincidence, two's a crisis,

502
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:28,228
16 is a fucking pandemic.

503
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:30,266
- So you think he's back now?

504
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:31,099
Today?

505
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:31,932
With all due respect Ralph,

506
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:33,735
it just seems like a
little bit of a stretch.

507
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:35,652
- I didn't say I thought he was back.

508
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:39,112
We're looking at a copycat,
intentional or not.

509
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,123
I wanna know who sent those flowers.

510
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:42,392
Trace that delivery.

511
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,690
- Is that what you did back then?

512
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,817
That work out for you pretty good?

513
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,650
- No.

514
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:02,120
Hey, look at this guy over here!

515
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,953
- Hey, Frank Frontera.

516
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,492
Salud.

517
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:15,204
Hey,.

518
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:20,086
Welcome back my friend.

519
00:34:20,086 --> 00:34:22,071
- I can't believe my eyes.

520
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:23,497
Look at you.

521
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,565
I was hoping you'd look a little bit more

522
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,503
fucking old or something.

523
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:28,957
How's life on the outside?

524
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:31,221
- As long as my young friends
keep buying me drinks,

525
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,388
no complaints.

526
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:38,908
I'm looking at young
copies of old friends.

527
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:42,799
When did everybody up
and die and get replaced?

528
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:43,975
- I don't know.

529
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:45,808
It's strange.

530
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:49,351
- Excuse me.

531
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:06,585
- Lou, to what do I owe the pleasure?

532
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:07,569
Have a seat.

533
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:09,486
- I can stand.

534
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,045
We got words.

535
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:11,878
- We do?

536
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:15,235
- I'll be quick.

537
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:21,761
- What's up Lou?

538
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,991
Usually, you need something

539
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,139
disposable for that.

540
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:32,436
Like a tissue.

541
00:35:32,436 --> 00:35:33,269
Me?

542
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,852
I get Lou Marazano.

543
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:39,421
- That's pretty fucking funny.

544
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,475
You need to take care of your family.

545
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:44,627
Always late on your payments.

546
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:47,352
I'm fucking disgusted with you.

547
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,503
You gotta get out and throw your stick

548
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,905
around for a couple of dogs, fine.

549
00:35:50,905 --> 00:35:53,213
Just remember where your blood is.

550
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:56,115
He's a good kid, he needs his father.

551
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:57,624
- You're right.

552
00:35:57,624 --> 00:35:58,874
- That's right.

553
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:02,510
- Who was your father Lou?

554
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,013
Paint me a picture.

555
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:04,846
- Hey.

556
00:36:06,403 --> 00:36:08,805
Is this really the night for that?

557
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:10,103
- Fucking hands off me.

558
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:11,736
- Lou!

559
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:12,986
Come over here.

560
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:16,441
- Now I'm gonna let that go.

561
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:21,485
- Lou Marazano.

562
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:26,845
Lou here, he kills this fat union fuck,

563
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,076
now he thinks he can instigate

564
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:31,576
whenever he wants, with whomever he wants.

565
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:34,546
So you tell me Lou,

566
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:38,135
you taking over Cicero now?

567
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:40,045
- It's not the way it is Enz.

568
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:42,055
This is strictly family shit.

569
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:44,069
- Except it's not.

570
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,153
And you need to know that by now.

571
00:36:46,153 --> 00:36:48,066
If things go with Cicero,

572
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:50,385
it's never strictly
anything with you two again.

573
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:52,754
And don't you forget it.

574
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,812
Here's to Frank Salerno.

575
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,166
Welcome back my friend.

576
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:17,459
What the fuck is pension rift?

577
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:21,459
"His primary known contact
is a man named" what?

578
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:25,868
Ray Berkowski.

579
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:28,035
Ray.

580
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:42,010
Still into late
nights and early mornings?

581
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,331
- What do you say tiger?

582
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:44,581
Is this for me?

583
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:47,048
- Half of it.

584
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,349
- I'll take what I can get.

585
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:57,094
- So I hear you can place Joe Barbone

586
00:37:57,094 --> 00:37:58,768
at the Franklin crime scene.

587
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:00,942
- We got his Lexus 10 yards away,

588
00:38:00,942 --> 00:38:04,082
a witness in the bar around
the corner puts him there.

589
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,123
His wife hadn't seen him since.

590
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:07,164
- How much you wanna bet the feds aren't

591
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:08,512
gonna be very happy?

592
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:12,391
They're gonna be barking
around here pretty soon.

593
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,308
- We got flowers Harry.

594
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:16,914
- No Ralph.

595
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:17,747
- What?

596
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,919
- How old would he have to be?

597
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:22,555
Don't go jump starting senility.

598
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:24,942
You've always been a few years
from a blubbering old man.

599
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:25,775
- What the fuck did I say?

600
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:27,930
I just said we got flowers.

601
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,568
Hey, this ain't your home no more.

602
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:32,397
Get out of my ass, you're
worse than my ulcers.

603
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:35,486
- Yeah, that's me doing that.

604
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:36,950
What's your gut say?

605
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,780
- It says after 20 years of nothing,

606
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,030
we got flowers.

607
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,914
34 East Shiller.

608
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:47,038
East Shiller with an S.

609
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:52,236
- Shiller, delivery, address,

610
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,058
I know you know these words.

611
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:54,891
- All right.

612
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:55,724
- Give me that.

613
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:01,285
Shiller.

614
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,118
- Shiller?

615
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:02,951
- Yes, Shiller.

616
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:04,868
What does he look like?

617
00:39:09,454 --> 00:39:10,287
Skinny?

618
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:14,063
Fat?

619
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:16,889
Largo?

620
00:39:20,602 --> 00:39:21,435
- A boy.

621
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:29,476
13,.

622
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,300
- 13, boy, red hood.

623
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,428
I don't know, you know,

624
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:41,316
maybe it's me Ralph, but 13's a little

625
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:42,578
young for you and your car.

626
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:43,411
- You're staying here.

627
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:45,149
I'll catch back up with you later.

628
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,794
- I don't understand this
lead we're working on here.

629
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:49,037
- Start by shaking up
every 13-year-old Latino

630
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:50,606
who goes by that flower shop.

631
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:53,360
A red hood would be nice.

632
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,236
Our lead is the boy.

633
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:56,319
Find the boy.

634
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:07,614
- Hello.

635
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,725
We gotta meet.

636
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:10,142
I'll pick you up.

637
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:20,891
- Michael, come say
goodbye to your grandpa!

638
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,221
- I'll see you pal.

639
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,599
Be a good boy.

640
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:34,907
- Alderman in there's putting wood

641
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:37,026
to his secretary late nights.

642
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:39,080
One of Bobby's Russians got family ties

643
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,236
to the cleaning crew.

644
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:41,986
That's your best bet.

645
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:45,551
Administration says gotta
be done by Thursday.

646
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:46,801
Gotta be clean.

647
00:40:48,026 --> 00:40:49,997
How you feeling?

648
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:51,846
- Having the time of my life.

649
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:53,159
Why?

650
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,303
- You know, you wanna sit this one out?

651
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:56,053
Nobody's gonna judge.

652
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:06,413
- Fixing that up for the kid?

653
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:07,679
- Fixing it up for myself.

654
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,512
I gotta keep busy.

655
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:09,516
How ya doing Ralph.

656
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:10,645
- How are ya brother?

657
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:11,558
- So when are you gonna cash in

658
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:13,359
and get yourself a gold watch?

659
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,976
- When my cellphone dies.

660
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,381
Who needs a gold watch these days?

661
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:20,155
I need something to show for it first.

662
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:22,948
- Yeah, guys like us weren't
meant for this kind of job.

663
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,755
We should have been firefighters.

664
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,577
You wanna beer?

665
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:28,038
- Yeah, sure.

666
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:28,871
Why not?

667
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:38,730
So tell me about Pension Rift.

668
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,481
- It started back when the

669
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,195
state redid the expressways

670
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:43,862
with 60 year cement.

671
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,913
It wasn't until '91 union bean counters

672
00:41:47,913 --> 00:41:49,503
finally noticed that million of dollars

673
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:52,932
got siphoned off the pension funds.

674
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:55,136
I got called in to stretch Barbone

675
00:41:55,136 --> 00:41:56,588
for some felony assaults that were

676
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:58,572
linked to the investigation.

677
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:00,875
I mean, the whole thing was mobbed up.

678
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,491
- You're kidding me?

679
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:05,862
How'd something like that get tucked away?

680
00:42:05,862 --> 00:42:07,796
- Well, I was only working
on it for a few weeks

681
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:10,021
before they called me off
and moved up the ranks.

682
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:12,354
But things were very sloppy.

683
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,092
You know how it is.

684
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:19,133
Alderman Rossi was suspected
of laundering money

685
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:23,296
through charity
organizations from his ward.

686
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:27,750
It's amazing who gets
elected today and who stays.

687
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,063
I strongly suggest you do
what you can while you can.

688
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:33,017
- Amen to that brother.

689
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:17,223
This is what
happens when you use people.

690
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:19,056
They make it too easy.

691
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:22,007
What I never got was,

692
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:24,308
I know she was using me too.

693
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:26,391
But for why and for what?

694
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:28,738
Really, for what?

695
00:43:38,263 --> 00:43:39,977
- What have you seen?

696
00:43:39,977 --> 00:43:41,810
- 20 suspects an hour.

697
00:43:42,701 --> 00:43:43,534
- And?

698
00:43:45,638 --> 00:43:47,554
- I'm going up to every one of 'em

699
00:43:47,554 --> 00:43:49,296
who walks by that flower shop

700
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,790
and not one red hood.

701
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,957
I mean this is ridiculous.

702
00:43:58,992 --> 00:44:02,329
- In '88, me and Harry staked
out 68th and Blackstone

703
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:05,329
after a body washed up in the river.

704
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,808
We lived off of peanuts
and pissed in pop bottles,

705
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:11,096
slept with our eyes open.

706
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:13,763
Neither one of us left the car for a week.

707
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:15,651
'Cause we knew that when it went down,

708
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,154
the both of us had to be there.

709
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:20,185
We knew that doing your fucking job means

710
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:22,102
doing your fucking job.

711
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:29,497
I've known Harry since we
were both wearing blue shirts.

712
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:33,080
He's an honest fucking
cop, among very few.

713
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:37,818
Better or worse, that
shit don't go unnoticed.

714
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:42,986
Shut up would ya?

715
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:45,740
I got a hangover.

716
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,532
- You in the red, police.

717
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:15,365
Stop!

718
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:21,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

719
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,063
Hey, all right.

720
00:45:22,063 --> 00:45:22,896
All right, easy, easy, easy.

721
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:24,083
Speedy turn around.

722
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,488
You understand these words?

723
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:26,759
Stop.

724
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:28,666
Police, it doesn't mean anything to you?

725
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,206
Come on, I'm not gonna find any drugs

726
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:32,293
or weapons in here am I?

727
00:45:32,293 --> 00:45:34,201
What do we got here?

728
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:35,201
What's that?

729
00:45:37,841 --> 00:45:40,910
Where'd you
get the cash, Rodrigo?

730
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,056
- My mother.

731
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:43,935
I was gonna buy shoes.

732
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:47,552
- Your mother gave you $70 to buy shoes?

733
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:48,824
Let's go.

734
00:45:48,824 --> 00:45:50,153
I wanna ask her in person.

735
00:45:50,153 --> 00:45:52,000
- Wait, wait, wait, okay.

736
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,464
I did a favor for this
guy, running errands.

737
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:56,054
- What kind of errands?

738
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,161
- Flowers?

739
00:45:57,161 --> 00:45:58,411
Was it flowers?

740
00:46:01,296 --> 00:46:04,098
Look, somebody died kid.

741
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:07,785
Somebody sent flowers
to a guy who got killed.

742
00:46:07,785 --> 00:46:10,778
That's a very bad thing
to get wrapped up in.

743
00:46:10,778 --> 00:46:13,012
Now you tell me, and you be very careful

744
00:46:13,012 --> 00:46:15,236
how you answer me.

745
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:17,354
What did he look like?

746
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:19,058
- He looked like you.

747
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:20,087
- Like me?

748
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:20,920
- Yeah.

749
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,837
You know, old and shit.

750
00:46:23,736 --> 00:46:25,559
All right, let's go.

751
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:26,520
- Come on.

752
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,687
This way junior.

753
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:56,578
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

754
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:09,920
- Hey!

755
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:12,971
What are you doing?

756
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:17,612
Come on.

757
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:31,839
You're not hungry?

758
00:47:32,821 --> 00:47:34,654
- I don't like onions.

759
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:38,808
- That's a Chicago Dog,
it's like a sandwich.

760
00:47:38,808 --> 00:47:42,004
It's got tomatoes, relish, pickles,

761
00:47:42,004 --> 00:47:43,337
mustard, onions.

762
00:47:46,386 --> 00:47:48,745
And I'm gonna sit right
here until you eat it.

763
00:47:48,745 --> 00:47:52,328
Otherwise, you're gonna
walk yourself home.

764
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:01,222
Is that such a problem?

765
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:03,798
You like it?

766
00:48:04,822 --> 00:48:05,655
- No.

767
00:48:07,235 --> 00:48:08,068
- No.

768
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:12,007
I said that too.

769
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:15,251
My father did the same thing.

770
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:16,908
He caught me tuning up a couple of kids

771
00:48:16,908 --> 00:48:18,073
when I was your age.

772
00:48:18,073 --> 00:48:21,596
He gave me a smack,
like I'll never forget.

773
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:24,346
And then we ate dogs, right here.

774
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:30,606
Not exactly here, but
a place just like this.

775
00:48:30,606 --> 00:48:33,773
He said to me "Lou, you're a Marazano.

776
00:48:35,284 --> 00:48:37,344
"The blood that pumps through your heart,

777
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:40,119
"that keeps you alive day after day

778
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:42,948
"is the same blood that built this city."

779
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:45,229
They tuft it out so I could have it good.

780
00:48:45,229 --> 00:48:47,422
Now you've got it better.

781
00:48:47,422 --> 00:48:48,638
What the hell are you doing

782
00:48:48,638 --> 00:48:51,496
working over a kid like that?

783
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:52,893
Was it for money?

784
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:53,726
- No.

785
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:56,309
He doesn't have any?

786
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:58,929
- Then what's the point?

787
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:00,813
- I don't know.

788
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,106
- You don't know.

789
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,443
That's pretty stupid.

790
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,071
I mean, when I was a kid
we did some stupid things,

791
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,516
but never for nothing.

792
00:49:08,516 --> 00:49:12,599
If you get caught, what
do ya got to show for it?

793
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:16,353
You do this a lot?

794
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,603
- I don't know.

795
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:20,436
- Listen to me, I don't wanna hear

796
00:49:20,436 --> 00:49:23,028
another I don't know out of your mouth.

797
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:24,445
Question, answer.

798
00:49:26,191 --> 00:49:29,292
You be straight with people,
they'll be straight with you.

799
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,620
If you don't know your answer,

800
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,620
then that's the trouble.

801
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,100
Your father teach you this stuff?

802
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:46,192
Finish your dog.

803
00:49:54,466 --> 00:49:56,237
It's gonna be a talk.

804
00:49:56,237 --> 00:49:58,248
It's gonna be a good talk.

805
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,599
It's gonna make a difference.

806
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,682
It's gonna make a family.

807
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:05,788
This right here's a situation gonna go

808
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:07,722
one of two ways.

809
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:09,617
And the first one is the way it's gonna go

810
00:50:09,617 --> 00:50:12,767
because if I think about the
second way it's gonna happen,

811
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:16,415
I'm gonna really start to like the idea.

812
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:21,034
You should be
doing more fucking work

813
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:23,393
instead of fucking with
Johnny the Puerto Rican.

814
00:50:23,393 --> 00:50:25,310
Fucking coconut monkey.

815
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:38,924
- We gotta have a talk.

816
00:50:40,827 --> 00:50:44,327
- We've been having a few of those lately.

817
00:50:45,957 --> 00:50:47,799
You a whiskey man, ain't you Lou?

818
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:49,882
Sharon, two old fashions.

819
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:55,806
She makes a beauty of a drink.

820
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:58,396
Now listen, I'm fine sitting down,

821
00:50:58,396 --> 00:50:59,744
getting shit right between us.

822
00:50:59,744 --> 00:51:01,161
But, I gotta ask,

823
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:04,637
you running juice for Angela now?

824
00:51:04,637 --> 00:51:05,800
What about Lorenzo?

825
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,071
How many points she giving ya?

826
00:51:08,071 --> 00:51:10,459
- I'm not fucking around here Joey.

827
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:14,214
You and Angela are adults,
that's between you two.

828
00:51:14,214 --> 00:51:15,666
I'm here on behalf of Michael.

829
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:16,499
He's a good kid.

830
00:51:16,499 --> 00:51:17,716
- I know he's a good kid.

831
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:19,479
He's my fucking son.

832
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:22,598
- He's been getting in fights,
beating up kids for nothing.

833
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:25,265
- Like you didn't do
the same thing, come on.

834
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:26,813
- I had an old man to straighten me out.

835
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:28,480
He needs his father.

836
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,270
- He has a father.

837
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:38,406
- You're not fucking listening to me Joey.

838
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:40,823
You're all yipped up on snow.

839
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:45,222
- You got a lot of balls saying that.

840
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:47,175
I mean, who the fuck do you think you are?

841
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:48,348
Parent of the year?

842
00:51:48,348 --> 00:51:50,006
- This is not about me.

843
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,839
This is about Michael.

844
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:54,587
- Not anymore it's not.

845
00:51:54,587 --> 00:51:55,974
You fucked that up.

846
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:57,302
Just like the great fucking job

847
00:51:57,302 --> 00:51:59,046
you did on your daughter.

848
00:51:59,046 --> 00:52:00,238
You ought to be apologizing to me

849
00:52:00,238 --> 00:52:02,212
you geriatric mother fucker.

850
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:04,417
You know, she's got a hard
on for pieces of shit.

851
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:06,863
Gee, I wonder where she got that from?

852
00:52:11,898 --> 00:52:13,359
- Sit down.

853
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,191
You interrupted a family conference.

854
00:52:17,191 --> 00:52:18,530
If I have to come back here one more time,

855
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,204
you're fucking dead.

856
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,273
You hear me?

857
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:25,095
Take care of yours and be
grateful for the privilege.

858
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:27,428
Try me you fucking jack off!

859
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:05,481
- Lonely in your office?

860
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:08,040
Corner view don't make for good company?

861
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,268
- Hey, do me a favor,

862
00:53:10,268 --> 00:53:11,101
don't.

863
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,331
No sense in reopening this case.

864
00:53:13,331 --> 00:53:14,276
Nothing to be gained.

865
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:17,000
Some bitch got misty,
sent his wife flowers.

866
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,360
- We got a 13-year-old kid
in Pilsen says otherwise.

867
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,846
Really, well that's something.

868
00:53:21,846 --> 00:53:23,749
Yeah, I'll give you that.

869
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:26,871
Gotta ask though, says otherwise to what?

870
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,929
13-year-old Mexican
punk looky-loo testimony

871
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:30,758
ain't worth a taco shit and you know it.

872
00:53:30,758 --> 00:53:33,348
- Good thing I got friends
in high places right?

873
00:53:33,348 --> 00:53:36,707
Jesus Ralph, why
don't you just retire?

874
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:37,540
Who'd of thought?

875
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,123
Most optimistic stewed
potato on the force.

876
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:47,551
You report to me and that's a courtesy.

877
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:50,220
Until you get something,

878
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,274
not a word of this spills.

879
00:53:51,274 --> 00:53:53,075
We don't need your bullshit
leaking to the press

880
00:53:53,075 --> 00:53:54,075
or the feds.

881
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:00,053
I'll humor you under one condition.

882
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:01,326
- What's that?

883
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:02,884
- A shower.

884
00:54:02,884 --> 00:54:05,235
Just once, I'm dying to see what happens.

885
00:54:05,235 --> 00:54:06,621
If you start washing down the drain

886
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:08,044
I'll light a candle.

887
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:33,259
Freeman.

888
00:54:33,259 --> 00:54:35,758
It's Maloney, how's
your view of the Alderman?

889
00:54:35,758 --> 00:54:37,586
- Occasionally entertaining.

890
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:39,376
He's got a
campaign event at two.

891
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,685
Tail him.

892
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,102
Yeah.

893
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:10,052
Yeah.

894
00:55:10,052 --> 00:55:11,632
Our friends got some added heat.

895
00:55:11,632 --> 00:55:12,665
It ain't right.

896
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:13,597
When's it ever?

897
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:16,004
- I'm just telling you what I'm seeing.

898
00:55:16,004 --> 00:55:18,517
It ain't up to you
to determine what's right.

899
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:21,192
You said it was you, so it's you.

900
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,859
This motherfuckers done
the dawn after next.

901
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:30,556
I'll do the favor of
forgetting this conversation.

902
00:55:30,556 --> 00:55:32,538
Lorraine!

903
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,891
- We have nothing to
say to each other Lou.

904
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:37,102
- Listen, I'm sorry!

905
00:55:37,102 --> 00:55:38,779
Just give me a chance!

906
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:41,491
- Yeah, I've given you
20 years of chances.

907
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:44,408
And now it's become a boring rerun!

908
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:47,604
- Stuff came up with my son-in-law,

909
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:49,224
it needed sorting out.

910
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:50,434
All right?

911
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,925
Just let me come in and explain.

912
00:55:51,925 --> 00:55:53,543
- Yeah, is that what you call it now?

913
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:55,467
Is that what we do, explaining?

914
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:57,470
You come over, you fuck
me after you get done

915
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,041
with God knows what terrible thing

916
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:00,613
you're out there doing?

917
00:56:00,613 --> 00:56:03,518
I get to go over my lines
just in case you get caught!

918
00:56:03,518 --> 00:56:05,944
You are a selfish prick!

919
00:56:05,944 --> 00:56:06,777
- Come on Lorraine,

920
00:56:06,777 --> 00:56:08,101
it wasn't like that last night.

921
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:09,313
- "It wasn't like that last night."

922
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:10,959
Right, you know what Lou?

923
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:12,626
I don't want a commitment.

924
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:13,665
I just wanted dinner that's not a

925
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,696
figment of my imagination.

926
00:56:15,696 --> 00:56:17,370
Now go fuck yourself!

927
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,325
Lorraine, why don't you stop!

928
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:20,230
Lorraine!

929
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:35,786
First time Frankie went away,

930
00:56:35,786 --> 00:56:38,193
was on account of something dumb.

931
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:41,389
Next time was on account
of something personal.

932
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:43,604
Keeping everyone around me at a distance

933
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:46,394
made me a cold son of a bitch.

934
00:56:46,394 --> 00:56:48,532
But it kept me alive.

935
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:51,371
Tonight, that's exactly
what I'm trying to be.

936
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:53,204
A cold son of a bitch.

937
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:04,997
- Here ya go chief.

938
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:08,692
Lock up when you're done fellas.

939
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:17,104
Cute little number.

940
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:28,146
That's our show for the night.

941
00:57:28,146 --> 00:57:29,479
What next chief?

942
00:57:30,426 --> 00:57:31,405
- We wait.

943
00:57:31,405 --> 00:57:33,081
- Police have added union representative

944
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:36,057
Joseph Barbone to the missing persons list

945
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:37,789
after his car was found at the scene

946
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:40,060
of a shooting late last week.

947
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,967
The 600 block of Bert Franklin

948
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:44,980
was ruled a crime scene
after a bloody trail

949
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,195
and several nine millimeter encasements

950
00:57:47,195 --> 00:57:50,945
were found on the sidewalk
in a nearby alley.

951
00:57:54,626 --> 00:57:57,017
Regarding false testimony in conjunction

952
00:57:57,017 --> 00:57:58,527
with previous indictments.

953
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,360
Fuck.

954
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,201
- Police are asking the
community for any information

955
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:03,443
leading to the whereabouts of Joe Barbone.

956
00:58:03,443 --> 00:58:04,292
- Mirelli.

957
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,611
It's me, Phil Rossi.

958
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:07,284
Come on, pick up.

959
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:08,344
Listen, I'm...

960
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:13,325
- You all right?

961
00:58:18,423 --> 00:58:20,173
Here we go!

962
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:25,498
- In progress, 10 block
perimeter on Madison.

963
00:58:25,498 --> 00:58:27,081
Request assistance.

964
00:58:52,723 --> 00:58:53,723
- Excuse me!

965
00:59:13,536 --> 00:59:14,701
You all right?

966
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:16,784
- No, he's not breathing.

967
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:21,204
- We got a white male,
possible asphyxiation,

968
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:22,300
request EMT.

969
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,756
- Tell them to pick up a fucking priest.

970
00:59:24,756 --> 00:59:27,923
Dispatch, homicide suspect.

971
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:14,965
- Good evening officer.

972
01:00:14,965 --> 01:00:16,662
- I noticed you were limping.

973
01:00:16,662 --> 01:00:18,108
Is there a problem, are you hurt?

974
01:00:18,108 --> 01:00:21,187
- Just a little arthritis,
nothing serious.

975
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:23,769
I'm out for a walk, it
keeps the joints loose.

976
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:25,321
- Where ya headed to tonight?

977
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,397
- Headed back to the old lady's place.

978
01:00:27,397 --> 01:00:29,677
Walking keeps my blood flowing.

979
01:00:29,677 --> 01:00:31,363
Helps me keep a hard on.

980
01:00:31,363 --> 01:00:34,318
- Well shit head, you got any ID's on you?

981
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,332
- I got ID back at my old lady's place.

982
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:39,557
I'm parked out front.

983
01:00:39,557 --> 01:00:40,827
- Well it's your lucky night,

984
01:00:40,827 --> 01:00:42,127
'cause you're gonna get a lift.

985
01:00:42,127 --> 01:00:43,294
Grab the hood.

986
01:01:06,151 --> 01:01:07,568
- What's new Lou?

987
01:01:09,424 --> 01:01:10,924
You ever get that?

988
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:13,433
I bet you do Lou.

989
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:18,395
Know any good flower shop in Pilsen?

990
01:01:20,865 --> 01:01:21,948
Is that gold?

991
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,449
A gold watch.

992
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:29,019
We all get one of them sooner or later.

993
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:33,400
It's important to know
when it's your time.

994
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,371
I heard you gotta go for a jog

995
01:01:35,371 --> 01:01:37,372
before you get a hard on.

996
01:01:37,372 --> 01:01:40,502
Well that's a sad state
of affairs there pal.

997
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:44,257
Don't get me wrong, my
prostates like Thunderdome,

998
01:01:44,257 --> 01:01:46,029
think you can't even get a hard on.

999
01:01:46,029 --> 01:01:47,862
That is old my friend.

1000
01:01:49,149 --> 01:01:50,963
I mean, no disrespect, but look at you.

1001
01:01:50,963 --> 01:01:52,713
Something went wrong.

1002
01:01:54,486 --> 01:01:56,469
Let's drop the bullshit.

1003
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:58,096
You're scum.

1004
01:01:58,096 --> 01:02:02,842
You have been for half
a century, maybe longer.

1005
01:02:02,842 --> 01:02:04,175
That's just sad.

1006
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:08,736
Never made captain.

1007
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:12,549
Never even came close.

1008
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,089
- What's your excuse?

1009
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:22,089
- I've been meaning to ask
you something for a long time.

1010
01:02:22,328 --> 01:02:24,338
What kind of a man sends flowers

1011
01:02:24,338 --> 01:02:27,590
to the widow of a man he's killed?

1012
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,840
What kind of a man is that?

1013
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,282
- I give up.

1014
01:02:34,282 --> 01:02:37,104
I'm not very good at knock knock jokes.

1015
01:02:37,104 --> 01:02:38,197
- No, no.

1016
01:02:38,197 --> 01:02:39,197
I'm serious.

1017
01:02:40,328 --> 01:02:41,821
I mean, at first,

1018
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:43,466
I thought it was just some bullshit

1019
01:02:43,466 --> 01:02:44,883
wop respect deal.

1020
01:02:47,084 --> 01:02:50,513
You people got a lot of that bullshit.

1021
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,928
Then I thought, he's a psycho.

1022
01:02:52,928 --> 01:02:54,511
Can't separate himself
from what his mother

1023
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:55,844
told him he was.

1024
01:02:56,923 --> 01:03:00,699
And then I thought,
well he's just a faggot.

1025
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:04,532
But now, I just kinda
think he's chicken shit.

1026
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:07,494
Chicken shit in the eyes of God.

1027
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:10,460
Can't face up to his own evil.

1028
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,543
You little fucking pussy.

1029
01:03:14,397 --> 01:03:15,647
So tell me Lou,

1030
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:18,092
which is it?

1031
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,812
Chicken shit, or is he just a faggot?

1032
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:28,530
- I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about!

1033
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,280
- I think you do Lou.

1034
01:03:31,176 --> 01:03:33,926
Step forward number two.

1035
01:03:35,748 --> 01:03:38,331
- If you see him, shout it out.

1036
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,666
- None of these are the guy.

1037
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,061
- You sure?

1038
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:49,699
Take another look at 'em.

1039
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:50,616
Number one?

1040
01:03:52,183 --> 01:03:53,100
Number two?

1041
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:57,500
Are you sure?

1042
01:04:00,306 --> 01:04:01,655
- Yeah.

1043
01:04:01,655 --> 01:04:02,488
I'm sure.

1044
01:04:10,185 --> 01:04:12,685
Step back number two.

1045
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:17,114
- So was Mr.
Marazano with you earlier?

1046
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:17,947
- Yeah.

1047
01:04:20,014 --> 01:04:21,764
Came over around six.

1048
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:26,027
- Can ya fill me in on your evening?

1049
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,410
- Nothing special.

1050
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,220
Watched Jeopardy, the Wheel.

1051
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,177
My oven wasn't working so
I made some TV dinners.

1052
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,534
He had a fucking fit.

1053
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:42,451
My niece called, that took a while.

1054
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:45,521
He went for a walk and now he's in

1055
01:04:45,521 --> 01:04:47,063
a room with indigestion

1056
01:04:47,063 --> 01:04:49,024
and I'm sitting here enjoying the pleasure

1057
01:04:49,024 --> 01:04:51,325
of your company without my face on.

1058
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:53,524
- I just wanna make sure you realize,

1059
01:04:53,524 --> 01:04:55,032
honey you're lying to
me and I'm gonna charge

1060
01:04:55,032 --> 01:04:55,995
you as an accessory.

1061
01:04:55,995 --> 01:04:58,328
You already know that right?

1062
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,384
- You listen to me,

1063
01:05:01,384 --> 01:05:04,060
I've been with Lou Marazano for 20 years.

1064
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,510
You do not sit there with that smirk

1065
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,843
on your face and tell me
that I can be an accessory.

1066
01:05:13,928 --> 01:05:16,701
- Can you verify that Lou was with you

1067
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:19,534
last Wednesday evening 10:30 p.m.?

1068
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:30,067
It is a fucking no go.

1069
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:31,049
Stories corroborate.

1070
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:32,454
- What do you mean?

1071
01:05:32,454 --> 01:05:34,101
She said he left at 8:25.

1072
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:35,871
Coroners have Rossi dying at what?

1073
01:05:35,871 --> 01:05:37,169
8:30.

1074
01:05:37,169 --> 01:05:38,441
No way he could've gotten there on time.

1075
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,724
- What about last Wednesday?

1076
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:41,677
- Neighbor gave a statement saying

1077
01:05:41,677 --> 01:05:46,452
they saw his Caddy parked
out all night long, Ralph.

1078
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:48,119
We gotta let him go.

1079
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:55,063
What's the news counselor?

1080
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:56,983
The cleaning crew
was taken in last night.

1081
01:05:56,983 --> 01:05:58,320
- What are you telling me for?

1082
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,380
You know what to do.

1083
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,534
I understand
the protocol Stefano.

1084
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:04,317
I thought you'd appreciate
consultation on this one.

1085
01:06:04,317 --> 01:06:06,233
I'll tell
you what, history or no,

1086
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,514
messes are not to be tolerated.

1087
01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:10,264
Not now and not ever.

1088
01:06:11,307 --> 01:06:13,532
Now you clean it the fuck up!

1089
01:06:30,012 --> 01:06:32,129
- You watch your fucking
tone there counselor!

1090
01:06:32,129 --> 01:06:33,661
You know, I should have said fuck it!

1091
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:36,414
Let the old fuck rot in jail!

1092
01:06:36,414 --> 01:06:38,375
I was just doing a favor!

1093
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,375
And don't you forget it!

1094
01:06:42,863 --> 01:06:43,696
Lou.

1095
01:06:45,425 --> 01:06:47,204
He got pinched last night.

1096
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:49,370
Lou's never ratted out nobody.

1097
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,777
I seen him do his time like a man.

1098
01:06:51,777 --> 01:06:54,347
- Guys his age can't do time.

1099
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:57,014
They ain't got enough time left.

1100
01:06:57,966 --> 01:07:01,001
First he leaves his bad blood in Cicero

1101
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:01,834
and then...

1102
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:02,992
- Wait, wait, wait.

1103
01:07:02,992 --> 01:07:05,795
What are you saying Enzo?

1104
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:24,734
It starts with a call,

1105
01:07:24,734 --> 01:07:26,958
then it's a drive,

1106
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:29,365
and then it's a friend.

1107
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:33,168
I been on every angle
this situation before.

1108
01:07:33,168 --> 01:07:36,494
I've made the call, I've seen the drive,

1109
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:38,917
and I've been the friend.

1110
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:42,334
Every angle but the one I'm in right now.

1111
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:47,978
- How's your weekend?

1112
01:07:47,978 --> 01:07:49,825
- A little rough around the edges.

1113
01:07:49,825 --> 01:07:51,244
You?

1114
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:53,578
- Is there any other kind?

1115
01:07:53,578 --> 01:07:56,495
We don't do things like we used to.

1116
01:07:57,663 --> 01:07:59,860
- I don't get invited Sammy.

1117
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,237
- Yeah.

1118
01:08:01,237 --> 01:08:03,868
Things kinda change Lou.

1119
01:08:03,868 --> 01:08:06,854
You started treading water
a little too long there

1120
01:08:06,854 --> 01:08:07,711
It was a lot more fun when you were

1121
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:10,118
totally fucking nuts

1122
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:11,701
Remember that shit?

1123
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,406
You kind of fell off
after your wife left ya.

1124
01:08:17,406 --> 01:08:18,573
You know that?

1125
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:23,007
- Maybe I should talk to someone.

1126
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:24,257
Let it all out.

1127
01:08:29,256 --> 01:08:31,256
I could use a smoke Sam.

1128
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,687
- Sure thing pal.

1129
01:08:48,409 --> 01:08:49,242
Fuck!

1130
01:08:49,242 --> 01:08:50,503
God damn it!

1131
01:08:53,628 --> 01:08:56,504
Boss, go, go, go, go, go!

1132
01:09:54,546 --> 01:09:55,713
- Don't shoot!

1133
01:09:57,481 --> 01:09:59,490
- Fucked up my hand pretty good Lou!

1134
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,524
I'll be honest!

1135
01:10:01,524 --> 01:10:02,871
I'm a little pissed at ya!

1136
01:10:06,976 --> 01:10:10,059
- Why don't you go and fuck yourself!

1137
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,487
- Listen to me Lou,

1138
01:10:12,487 --> 01:10:14,731
you had a nice chance
here and you blew it!

1139
01:10:14,731 --> 01:10:16,421
Simple as that!

1140
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,366
You wanna do something for your family?

1141
01:10:18,366 --> 01:10:20,563
Drop your gun and come out!

1142
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:22,101
The only thing you got to offer them now

1143
01:10:22,101 --> 01:10:23,601
is your dead body!

1144
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:27,073
You make a run for it,

1145
01:10:27,073 --> 01:10:29,479
and they'll be the ones to pay!

1146
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:30,479
Come on out!

1147
01:10:32,551 --> 01:10:34,968
I promise you an open casket!

1148
01:10:41,519 --> 01:10:42,737
Lou!

1149
01:10:42,737 --> 01:10:44,584
- Fuck that, I'm going to Vegas!

1150
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:54,001
This is the angle of the situation

1151
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:55,584
I know pretty well.

1152
01:10:57,032 --> 01:10:59,477
We're like brothers to each other.

1153
01:10:59,477 --> 01:11:04,394
Difference is, I never wanted
a brother in the first place.

1154
01:11:45,826 --> 01:11:46,754
- Maloney, what's up?

1155
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:48,401
- Forget it pal.

1156
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:49,382
Do you think you're leaving?

1157
01:11:49,382 --> 01:11:50,787
It appears so.

1158
01:11:50,787 --> 01:11:52,576
So where do we stand?

1159
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:54,524
- It's been a pleasure Elliot.

1160
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:56,968
- All the feds care about is
sending D'Agnostino down state.

1161
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:57,897
They're not even looking, they don't care,

1162
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,484
they don't give a shit
about all the people

1163
01:11:59,484 --> 01:12:01,750
that Marazano killed!

1164
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,027
What about the Pension Rift file?

1165
01:12:04,027 --> 01:12:05,065
Last time I checked that was yours.

1166
01:12:05,065 --> 01:12:07,698
You started it, so what
are you gonna do about it?

1167
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:08,659
What now?

1168
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:10,575
- Keep it quiet pal.

1169
01:12:10,575 --> 01:12:12,575
There's no beating them.

1170
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,087
- Maloney's a good cop.

1171
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,928
And it can be very frustrating

1172
01:12:23,928 --> 01:12:26,019
only being a good cop.

1173
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:27,446
We gotta a revolving door of good cops

1174
01:12:27,446 --> 01:12:29,314
between the academy and dives.

1175
01:12:29,314 --> 01:12:30,231
You get me?

1176
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:32,443
- Yeah I do, sir,

1177
01:12:32,443 --> 01:12:36,037
and that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1178
01:12:36,037 --> 01:12:36,870
- I apologize.

1179
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,490
I got a pretty full plate right now

1180
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:39,590
and I'm headed to a conference.

1181
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,633
- Let me take over the case.

1182
01:12:41,633 --> 01:12:44,968
Look, Maloney was onto something.

1183
01:12:44,968 --> 01:12:48,283
Yeah, it was big and it
needs follow-through.

1184
01:12:48,283 --> 01:12:50,627
I mean, a victory like this sir,

1185
01:12:50,627 --> 01:12:53,710
is exactly what the department needs.

1186
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:56,898
- Tell me what you got son.

1187
01:12:56,898 --> 01:12:58,148
- Pension Rift.

1188
01:12:59,604 --> 01:13:00,523
- Not familiar.

1189
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:02,968
- It was this scandal in '91.

1190
01:13:02,968 --> 01:13:05,644
Barbone and Rossi were involved.

1191
01:13:05,644 --> 01:13:08,758
Some names were blacked
out on a case file.

1192
01:13:08,758 --> 01:13:09,687
Maloney thought that's what this

1193
01:13:09,687 --> 01:13:12,373
whole thing was about all along.

1194
01:13:12,373 --> 01:13:14,591
But we could use some help.

1195
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:16,786
I want this legal,

1196
01:13:16,786 --> 01:13:19,990
but I also want it done quickly.

1197
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:22,297
- The eternal struggle son.

1198
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:25,547
This department is covered in red tape.

1199
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:29,893
A good cop respects that.

1200
01:13:29,893 --> 01:13:31,951
A great cop respects it too much

1201
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:33,697
not to know what's behind.

1202
01:13:33,697 --> 01:13:34,614
You get me?

1203
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,967
- What time they gonna be there?

1204
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,253
- Is that Sammy?

1205
01:13:58,406 --> 01:14:01,092
- Geez Sammy, turn them off.

1206
01:14:01,092 --> 01:14:01,925
Fuck.

1207
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,603
- Lou!

1208
01:15:02,868 --> 01:15:04,295
- Lou.

1209
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:06,811
- Gloves are off Enz.

1210
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:09,445
- You better think this through Lou.

1211
01:15:09,445 --> 01:15:12,967
You better think about your daughter,

1212
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,467
your grandson

1213
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:18,647
You want them winding
up in Chinatown?

1214
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:21,882
It's a bad life Lou and even worse dead.

1215
01:15:21,882 --> 01:15:23,260
You hear me?

1216
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,155
- Sammy said the same thing,

1217
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:27,203
only he had a nicer tone.

1218
01:15:27,203 --> 01:15:29,203
- I don't do nicer tone.

1219
01:15:30,588 --> 01:15:32,338
Put away the gun Lou.

1220
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,995
You fucked up pretty bad in Cicero.

1221
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:40,310
And I don't know what the
score is yet right now,

1222
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:43,477
but I'm willing to overlook this thing

1223
01:15:44,783 --> 01:15:47,929
if you just put away the fucking gun.

1224
01:16:45,876 --> 01:16:47,293
- We got flowers.

1225
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:51,012
Flowers.

1226
01:16:52,644 --> 01:16:54,061
Think about that.

1227
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:58,567
What kind of a man almost goes to pieces,

1228
01:16:59,553 --> 01:17:01,803
let's everything fall apart

1229
01:17:02,788 --> 01:17:04,371
because of flowers?

1230
01:17:09,138 --> 01:17:11,221
What kind of man is that?

1231
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,088
- Jesus Christ Maloney, you've
been gone, for what, a day?

1232
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:27,086
You look like shit.

1233
01:17:27,086 --> 01:17:29,054
- Hey, I took some me time.

1234
01:17:29,054 --> 01:17:30,131
- All right, follow me.

1235
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:32,358
We got a four-bagger.

1236
01:17:32,358 --> 01:17:33,588
Listen, there was a shootout between the

1237
01:17:33,588 --> 01:17:34,713
warehouse district yesterday.

1238
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:36,940
Sammy Delano, a few of
Lorenzo's guys got turned

1239
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,200
into Swiss cheese.

1240
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,617
- So, this yours?

1241
01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:43,690
You got a lead on this?

1242
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:44,523
- Yeah, it's mine.

1243
01:17:44,523 --> 01:17:46,856
You got a problem with that?

1244
01:17:48,839 --> 01:17:49,922
- No I don't.

1245
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:51,957
- Good.

1246
01:17:52,882 --> 01:17:54,329
'Cause you're a liability my friend,

1247
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:56,467
but you're a resource and
I need ya on this one.

1248
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:58,153
I need you to make me look good.

1249
01:17:58,153 --> 01:18:02,585
That's a solid fucking
witness you got there.

1250
01:18:02,585 --> 01:18:03,713
Sir, excuse me...

1251
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:05,139
- He doesn't speak English.

1252
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,986
He doesn't understand English.
- He doesn't speak English?

1253
01:18:06,986 --> 01:18:09,182
Not at all.

1254
01:18:09,182 --> 01:18:10,015
- Hey.

1255
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:13,896
Grab that thing, submit it as evidence.

1256
01:18:13,896 --> 01:18:16,033
- Sir, I need to know
where you got this watch.

1257
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:24,785
Suspects apartment is on the
second floor, number two.

1258
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,235
Right there!

1259
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:29,330
I want someone around back
now in case of escape.

1260
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,163
You guys better put on some slack,

1261
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:31,894
suspect is considered armed and dangerous.

1262
01:18:31,894 --> 01:18:33,403
- All this for a 60-year-old?

1263
01:18:33,403 --> 01:18:34,583
- We've got him linked to nine homicides

1264
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:36,666
over the past three days.

1265
01:18:37,691 --> 01:18:39,069
- You like those odds?

1266
01:18:53,173 --> 01:18:55,012
Room clear!

1267
01:18:55,012 --> 01:18:55,845
Clear!

1268
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:58,056
- Jesus.

1269
01:18:58,056 --> 01:18:59,733
Search the building, the boiler room,

1270
01:18:59,733 --> 01:19:01,112
the fucking janitor's closet!

1271
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:02,589
Someone go door to door

1272
01:19:02,589 --> 01:19:04,672
and check each apartment.

1273
01:19:12,274 --> 01:19:16,211
I've been
expecting you Mr. Marazano.

1274
01:19:16,211 --> 01:19:17,044
- Easy.

1275
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:17,877
- Yes sir.

1276
01:19:23,069 --> 01:19:25,148
The problem still remains that

1277
01:19:25,148 --> 01:19:28,689
one of three informants
has not been silenced.

1278
01:19:28,689 --> 01:19:32,193
The young detective will lead you to him.

1279
01:19:32,193 --> 01:19:34,110
Make sure it gets done.

1280
01:19:36,818 --> 01:19:40,568
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1281
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:49,815
- Something you'd like to say?

1282
01:19:49,815 --> 01:19:51,323
- Open the door.

1283
01:19:51,323 --> 01:19:52,801
- What, you gonna hit me too?

1284
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:55,538
We don't have anything to say!

1285
01:19:55,538 --> 01:19:57,692
- Angela, open the door.

1286
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,359
I need you to open the door now!

1287
01:20:03,693 --> 01:20:05,098
- You make things worse with Joey

1288
01:20:05,098 --> 01:20:06,857
and that takes some kind of talent!

1289
01:20:06,857 --> 01:20:09,524
He's calling here talking crazy!

1290
01:20:14,084 --> 01:20:15,342
No, get that out of here Lou.

1291
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:16,978
- It's clean.

1292
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,098
I swear, I earned it.

1293
01:20:18,098 --> 01:20:18,931
- Yeah?

1294
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:19,764
How?

1295
01:20:21,163 --> 01:20:22,520
- It's an investment for a better life

1296
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,447
for you and Michael.

1297
01:20:24,447 --> 01:20:27,702
Just please take it and go away, leave.

1298
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,319
- I can't just do that.

1299
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:31,152
- What's here for you?

1300
01:20:32,182 --> 01:20:34,529
Go see your mother, go anywhere.

1301
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:39,529
You're never gonna get a
chance like this again Angela.

1302
01:20:39,622 --> 01:20:41,170
- Am I gonna see you again?

1303
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:44,420
- Yeah, you're gonna see me again baby.

1304
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,041
I'll go talk to Michael.

1305
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:51,062
You mind if I sit down?

1306
01:20:56,383 --> 01:20:59,133
Why don't you come and sit by me.

1307
01:21:01,914 --> 01:21:04,131
How ya doing, okay?

1308
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:07,786
Listen, grandpa's going on vacation.

1309
01:21:07,786 --> 01:21:09,431
- How long are you gonna be?

1310
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,660
Just a while.

1311
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,082
I just thought I'd come and talk to you.

1312
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:16,569
I wanted you to know that
I shouldn't have hit ya

1313
01:21:16,569 --> 01:21:17,736
and I'm sorry.

1314
01:21:20,463 --> 01:21:21,372
But you shouldn't have told your mother

1315
01:21:21,372 --> 01:21:24,078
about me hitting ya or the gun.

1316
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:26,772
- I didn't tell her about the gun.

1317
01:21:26,772 --> 01:21:27,960
- Good.

1318
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,078
Proud of you.

1319
01:21:29,078 --> 01:21:32,161
But I want you to remember something.

1320
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:34,791
To be brave,

1321
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,480
to be smart.

1322
01:21:39,725 --> 01:21:42,540
And I wanna see the person
that you're gonna be.

1323
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,707
And there's no room for I don't knows.

1324
01:21:46,763 --> 01:21:49,697
But most of all, don't ever tell

1325
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:53,114
your mother that I let you hold that gun.

1326
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:55,081
Okay?

1327
01:21:57,515 --> 01:22:01,895
In fact, don't ever pick up
a gun in your whole life.

1328
01:22:01,895 --> 01:22:03,521
You promise me that?

1329
01:22:03,521 --> 01:22:04,354
- Promise.

1330
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:06,148
Good.

1331
01:22:06,148 --> 01:22:07,834
You be a good boy.

1332
01:22:07,834 --> 01:22:10,040
Take care of your mother.

1333
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,957
You make me proud okay.

1334
01:22:15,313 --> 01:22:17,146
Grandpa loves you pal.

1335
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:22,859
You just be careful.

1336
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:26,994
And you get out of here
as soon as possible.

1337
01:22:26,994 --> 01:22:28,661
- Yeah, you too pop.

1338
01:22:33,512 --> 01:22:36,716
- You ask yourself, did you
do enough for you and yours?

1339
01:22:36,716 --> 01:22:37,549
Bye.

1340
01:22:38,782 --> 01:22:39,615
Nah.

1341
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,750
Not even close.

1342
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:51,243
- We checked all the public
areas in the building,

1343
01:22:51,243 --> 01:22:52,750
we'll have a blue shirt stick around

1344
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,207
in case he comes back.

1345
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:55,736
- He wasn't dumb enough to get caught here

1346
01:22:55,736 --> 01:22:57,174
in the first place.

1347
01:22:57,174 --> 01:22:58,272
He's not coming back.

1348
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:01,600
- Walsh.

1349
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,433
It's Harry.

1350
01:23:02,433 --> 01:23:03,771
Pension Rift's deeper than you think.

1351
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,079
Meet me at the La Salle garage

1352
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:06,816
after everybody clears out.

1353
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:08,233
- Good, I got it.

1354
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:15,536
Be on the lookout.

1355
01:23:15,536 --> 01:23:18,953
Suspect drives an '89 Cadillac Fleetwood.

1356
01:24:40,011 --> 01:24:41,325
What's he doing here?

1357
01:24:41,325 --> 01:24:43,101
- Listen, we got Marazano's watch.

1358
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:44,461
I take the latte on the side.

1359
01:24:44,461 --> 01:24:47,049
That is nine murders
that we can link him to.

1360
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:57,265
Why couldn't you just let it go?

1361
01:24:57,265 --> 01:25:00,182
- Civil servant, man of the people.

1362
01:25:01,139 --> 01:25:04,522
- It's a big picture thing Ralphy,

1363
01:25:04,522 --> 01:25:07,239
but we've had some fun.

1364
01:25:07,239 --> 01:25:09,435
Let's keep it at that.

1365
01:25:39,558 --> 01:25:41,602
Get on the ground!

1366
01:25:41,602 --> 01:25:43,762
Stop or I'll shoot!

1367
01:25:50,697 --> 01:25:51,780
Drop the gun!

1368
01:27:40,741 --> 01:27:44,606
- Looks like I'll make
Captain before you Flower Man.

1369
01:27:44,606 --> 01:27:46,422
- What about your partner?

1370
01:27:46,422 --> 01:27:49,078
- Drop your piece and turn around.

1371
01:27:49,078 --> 01:27:51,745
Nice and slow for me Flower Man.

1372
01:28:01,253 --> 01:28:02,920
You shot my partner.

1373
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,351
- You sure about that?

1374
01:28:06,351 --> 01:28:08,757
- I'm sure you killed 16 in '86

1375
01:28:08,757 --> 01:28:12,193
and you're having a pretty
good comeback, killer.

1376
01:28:12,193 --> 01:28:15,877
You've had quite the day
here fucking Flower Man.

1377
01:28:15,877 --> 01:28:17,189
- Yeah.

1378
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:19,247
How'd you do today?

1379
01:28:19,247 --> 01:28:21,599
- I did pretty good.

1380
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:24,688
Brought in a fucking mass murderer.

1381
01:28:24,688 --> 01:28:27,211
- I'll believe it when I see it.

1382
01:28:27,211 --> 01:28:29,448
You gonna arrest me

1383
01:28:29,448 --> 01:28:31,653
or just plead til you drown my boots?

1384
01:28:31,653 --> 01:28:33,909
- Maybe I'll just pull the trigger.

1385
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:35,007
How's that!

1386
01:28:35,007 --> 01:28:36,815
- You can't see a god damn thing!

1387
01:28:36,815 --> 01:28:39,065
- Shut the fuck up jackoff!

1388
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:41,689
Now you answer me.

1389
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,326
Which is it?

1390
01:28:44,326 --> 01:28:46,333
Chicken shit or faggot?

1391
01:28:50,276 --> 01:28:52,183
Chicken shit or faggot!

1392
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:11,750
- You tell me.

1393
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,067
I'll miss the rain.

1394
01:29:29,067 --> 01:29:32,516
The world smells better during and after.

1395
01:29:32,516 --> 01:29:34,349
But especially before,

1396
01:29:35,564 --> 01:29:37,981
because you know it's coming.

1397
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:42,932
Better get the fuck out of my way.
