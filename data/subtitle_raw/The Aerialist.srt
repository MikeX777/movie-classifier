you, tonight, I hope,

- Oh, I'll take it.

154

- Your aerial career.
- Mm.

156
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,246

157
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,260

158
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:06,216
that makes for a great headline, actually.

159
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,246
But there is a gap from
your gymnastics career.

160
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,575
Yeah, well, you did your homework,

161
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,928

162
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,386

164
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,629

184
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:24,459

a day to settle in, at least.

We don't have time to settle in.

187
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,767
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

188
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,373
New lighting units
are going in right here.

189
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,064
- T-Bone.
- Oh, we've got time.

190
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:34,065
Is this a load issue?

191
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,114
Mm-mm, new ones are actually lighter.

192
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:37,151
Jane.

193
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:38,027
Well, don't worry.

194
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,195
No, wait, can they share the same truss?

195
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,197
We're not starting from scratch.

196
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,489
I know it's not from scratch.

197
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:43,448
Downstage motors gonna

198
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:44,999
- have to shift.
- T-Bone, give us a minute.

199
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,909
Yeah, Iris has a wrist thing
anyway, so it's probably...

200
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:48,397
- Iris is indestructible.
- Chief, this will take

201
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,230
- two seconds.
- Yeah, well, they're

202
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:50,064
my two seconds.

203
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,551
Yeah, but safety first, right...

204
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:53,748
We don't have time for safety first!

205
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:56,915
Can you get them in the fucking air?!

206
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,309
We have two weeks.

207
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,751
It's not enough time.

208
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,094
Can you just make it happen?

209
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,053
Yes, we can work low.

210
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:07,469
- Yes.
- Thank you.

211
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:10,868
What are you looking at, Hathaway?

212
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:11,807
Fuck.

213
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,053
I'm gonna go hang some hammocks.

214
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,704
- Yeah.
- Okay.

215
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:17,288
The fuck was all that about?

216
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,981
- You all right?
- Yeah.

217
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:22,929
Okay, let's do it again.

218
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:26,013
And one, two, three, four, and spin,

219
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:29,635
six, seven, eight, up and in,

220
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,741
three, four, bird arms,

221
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:35,733
six, seven, eight, and up,

222
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:39,567
two, three, four, five,
six, seven, splat it!

223
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,953
Yes!

224
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,954
Now that's a good time.

225
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,447
Waking up.

226
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:48,583
- Oh, Lord.
- Hey.

227
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,548
How is it?

228
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:50,806
It was easier last year.

229
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,418
Ha, you were in better shape.

230
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:55,602
Girl, has anybody washed these?

231
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:56,607
You know they haven't.

232
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,982
Hathaway, would you...
I know, have they?

233
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,473
Would you have them
run through this please?

234
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:00,365
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

235
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:01,548
Hey, you guys, do it again.

236
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:05,549
Stay low, please, and
don't do anything stupid.

237
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:09,850
She's ready, but,
look, it's your decision.

238
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,196
I just need to make this happen now.

239
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,664
Yeah, we're gonna have to go to,

240
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,598
like, plan B or plan C
or whatever the fuck.

241
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:17,843
And I was just in there and I almost was,

242
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,927
like, passing out, so...

243
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:21,896
Of course.

244
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:25,188
All right.

245
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:26,855
Thank you, Richard.

246
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,942
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,026
It's fine.

248
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,499
It's not, it's back.

249
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:47,431
I'm out here smoking like
it's the fucking cure.

250
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:51,976
Does Aurora know?

251
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:54,645
You know how
spooked she gets before a tour.

252
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:55,729
Spencer.

253
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,973
I just told Richard, though.

254
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:02,420
Fuck, I thought I could get
you guys through rehearsals.

255
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,958
You don't have to.
We got this.

256
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:07,636
What about you?
Are you up for this?

257
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:09,566
How's the body?

258
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:10,689
I'm fine.

259
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,713
I'm scared, Jane.

260
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:21,624
Come on, come on.

261
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,125
We've survived the road and each other,

262
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:29,774
and we've thrived on the
road with each other.

263
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:33,166
It's been the greatest
experience of my life

264
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,604
to be part of this family.

265
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:39,385
But you guys are all gonna have
to go out there without me.

266
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:40,693
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:42,417
But I know you can handle it.

268
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,501
You're all well-behaved.

269
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:47,410
I'm not looking at you, Hathaway.

270
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:57,616
But if there are, like, any
squabbles going forward,

271
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,617
Jane is now senior officer on deck.

272
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,598
Okay, got my cigs, I'm
gonna go stand on a beach.

273
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:12,659
We're gonna go with you.

274
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:13,744
No arguments.

275
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:15,698
- Yeah.
- Paloma, stay and rehearse.

276
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:18,381
I can't stand in for your
mama anymore, darling.

277
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,654
I can rehearse on a beach.

278
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:20,613
Hey, we all can rehearse

279
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:21,665
- on the beach.
- Yeah.

280
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,036
- Come on.
- I'll bring the music.

281
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,094
We love you so much.

282
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,595
Love you so much.

283
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:32,776
All right, enough, please.

284
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,618
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

285
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:38,981
Get him, get him.

286
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,127
Grab my boots.

287
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:43,501
Bring wine.

288
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:45,625
Please bring the wine.

289
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,924
Oh, something's come
up, I can't do tonight.

290
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:50,091
Can we do tomorrow night?

291
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:53,223
You guys wanted
out of rehearsals, right?

292
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:55,740
Good excuse.

293
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:38,692
Hey.

294
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:39,943
Hi.

295
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,503
I thought the dancers were assigned

296
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:44,145
the same rooms as last time.

297
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:46,067
Oh, well, Jane's letting me stay here

298
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,898
so I don't have to drive back to the 'Bu.

299
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:49,490
Oh.

300
00:14:49,574 --> 00:14:52,074
And so where is Jane crashing?

301
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,308
She didn't tell me.

302
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:07,423
I barely recognize it.

303
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,169
Sure this is the place?

304
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,420
My eyes aren't that bad.

305
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:26,473
Seven, one, three, two.

306
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:31,376
Ow.

307
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:33,996
Hey.

308
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,458
That little cut is not the issue.

309
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,234
You could barely hold
your knife at dinner.

310
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,382
You should go see the gal
that put me back together.

311
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,383
She can put things back together?

312
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,247
I'll give her a call.

313
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,656
I'll hook you up.

314
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:01,578
I'm fine.

315
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,104
If you're the director now,

316
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:08,103
you can take the time to recover.

317
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:11,098
There were no aerials
in the show before you.

318
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:13,228
You made this show.

319
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,506
It's a family effort.

320
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,256
Wouldn't take this
family stuff too seriously,

321
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,868
especially with Richard.

322
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:22,369
He's all right.

323
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:27,954
You coming in?

324
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:30,776
I got a long drive.

325
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:34,856
Oh.

326
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,302
Call her.

327
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:46,879
Walk me to my car?

328
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:04,332
I almost forgot.

329
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:11,060
You're gonna wanna open the gift first,

330
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:12,646
before you read the card.

331
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,191
Okay.

332
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,417
And don't worry, it's not a knife.

333
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,334
I moved on from those.

334
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,446
Are you kidding me?!

335
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,613
Dan.

336
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:07,355
Ah, I'm practically cutting
myself on your biceps,

337
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:09,318
so you must be real.

338
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:13,151
I wasn't surprised not to
see you at the funeral,

339
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,612
but I thought, "Just maybe."

340
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:19,196
Well, even if I wanted to
go, Gayle wasn't having it.

341
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,434
Oh, the new wife is always
leery of the old wife, I guess.

342
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:24,513
Leery?

343
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:26,421
She sent lawyers after me.

344
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,255
Oh.

345
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,020
She was surprised to discover

346
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,643
my name was still on the title.

347
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:31,922
That explains it.

348
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,133
Explains what?

349
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:35,043
When she came to clear out their things,

350
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:38,153
I caught her trying to throw
out a box of your stuff.

351
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,112
I have stuff?

352
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:42,123
Just old documents, gymnastic medals,

353
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:44,104
I put them back in the attic.

354
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:45,796
She thought I owed David something.

355
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,919
So now you owe her something?

356
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:48,753
But what?

357
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:49,976
The house?

358
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,131
No.

359
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:55,882
They haven't lived here in
forever, so don't sweat it.

360
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,198
He didn't hate me?

361
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:00,282
No.

362
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
To David.

363
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,142
To David.

364
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,492
It's a special effects shot.

365
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,048
- Ooh.
- Yeah, and you know what,

366
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:31,134
it's only our second night,

Paloma.

378
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,592
Paloma.

379
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:47,495
- Paloma.
- Yeah.

380
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:50,265
You good?

381
00:21:58,739 --> 00:21:59,739
Hi.

382
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:04,213
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

383
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:05,547
I'm a Pisces.

384
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:08,423
Water sign.

385
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,254
Oh, oh, oh, you mean about that one there.

386
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:16,555
Oh, sure, sure, I got a minute.

387
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,348
Press record, I'll tell
you a couple of stories.

388
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:19,427
Great.

389
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:21,119
- All right.
- I don't wanna do this.

390
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,739
I understand that this is hard.

391
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:24,706
Yeah, 'cause it doesn't take a genius.

392
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,646
Look at me.

393
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,940
I'm not her, I'm nothing
like her, I couldn't be,

394
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:29,701
- even if I wanted to.
- We don't want your mom,

395
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:30,560
we want you.

396
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:31,911
Your body doing the moves.

397
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:33,798
Your voice singing out.

398
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:36,438
Oh, no, I'm not doing that.

399
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,115
Paloma, you used to sing like a bird.

400
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,996
Yeah, but I don't anymore, all right?

401
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,830
That's her thing.

402
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:43,962
She owns that thing.

403
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,343
What, all right, let's leave
that at the door, all right?

404
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,829
This is a job, so step up.

405
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:50,054
If you drag your feet,

406
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:52,388
we all drag our feet, okay?

407
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:55,202
But why do I have to sing?

408
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,105
What is the point of that?

409
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:58,028
Because you've gotta engage,

410
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:02,252
you've to do it all, that's the act, okay?

411
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:05,503
This isn't for her, it's for us, okay?

412
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:09,531
Okay.

413
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,181
And I know you can be cuter.

414
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,376
Come on, come on.

415
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,436
- Come on, come on!
- Okay.

416
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,135
- Come on, okay, okay.
- All right.

417
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:21,755
Come on, come on, get a
little sass in that ass!

418
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,799
She's ready.

419
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:23,853
Back to one!

420
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:25,453
Okay, we're going from the top again,

421
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,602
this one's for Miss Paloma.

422
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:30,125
Aerialists on the ground,
just land drill, please.

423
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,709

Nice.

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,145

456
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:46,027
Huh? Oh, yeah.

00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,386
It's nothing.

458
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,457
Hey!

459
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,571
What's happening?

460
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,002
It's Jane's birthday!

461
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:53,316
Oh, my god!

462
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,357
Jane, come over here.

463
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:57,861
It's my birthday.

464
00:24:57,945 --> 00:24:58,945
570 years!

465
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:02,675
Call the fire department.

466
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:03,831
That's a crazy family

467
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:04,845
- we got here.
- Yeah, I love it.

468
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:09,878
I turned and I looked and it was Jane.

469
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:12,166
And even though she fell flat on her face,

470
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,994
she still came off stage
and said, "Good show."

471
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,723
Oh, I was there.

472
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,408
Oh, I was there.

473
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:21,586
But, you know, Jane only
had a small wild phase.

474
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,984
And maybe only made one mistake.

475
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,726
- Mm-hm.
- Several times.

476
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,458
- Oh, yeah.
- Just the one, one mistake,

477
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,099
- but more than once.
- Several times.

478
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:30,248
Yeah.

479
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:31,571
But again and again.

480
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,405
Uh, can I help you?

481
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:36,139
I was supposed to wait for Richard,

482
00:25:36,223 --> 00:25:39,556
but wanted to see how you guys rehearse.

483
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:42,756
I'm Xavier.

484
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,159
Zee, for short.

485
00:25:48,136 --> 00:25:50,671
I'm gonna be taking over for Spencer.

486
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,296
Like hell you are.

487
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,842
Yeah, should've waited for Richard.

488
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:57,855
Look, I just want you guys to know

489
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:01,224
that I am a big fan of Spencer's work.

490
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:04,528
He did some cool stuff back in the day.

491
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:07,576
And I get his style, so
this will go seamless.

492
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,699
This is so not happening.

493
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,338
Wait, I thought Jane was director now.

494
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:11,980
Yeah.

495
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:13,897
You're Jane Hawkins?

496
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:21,259
I've been looking forward
to working with you.

497
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:31,518
Happy birthday.

498
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:41,976
Richard, I don't
understand your thinking.

499
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,578
It should be Jane directing, if anybody.

500
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:45,486
This guy is like throwing a wrench

501
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,198
- into a well-oiled machine.
- Who is he, anyway?

502
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:49,564
I've never even heard of him.

503
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:51,979
Who cares about who he
is and where he came from?

504
00:26:52,063 --> 00:26:53,563
We don't need him.

505
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:05,915
You a roadie?

506
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:10,998
Concert technician.

507
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:16,497
Who's that?

508
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,024
That's a reporter.

509
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,963
And she is not going to
give a shit about you.

510
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:27,277
She's here for Jane.

511
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:31,297
And the other one is the
daughter, you know, the daughter,

512
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:35,411
someone I raised since
she slept in road cases.

513
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:38,422
Please, don't even think of going there.

514
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:39,756
Capiche, amigo?

515
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:41,728
Richard, come on.

516
00:27:41,812 --> 00:27:42,872
She has more experience

517
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:44,112
- than anybody.
- She has enough

518
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,913
on her plate already.

519
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,598
Her solo's a big part of the act,

520
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:50,438
she manages all the
aerials, deals with safety.

521
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:52,223
It's just too much to...
I can deal with safety-

522
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:54,640
- Ask her to, let me finish.

523
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:02,061
Just too much to ask because
this is not just another tour,

524
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,359
so we don't want to give the fans

525
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:07,831
just the same well-oiled
machine, but some real surprises,

526
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:10,883
and some fresh blood is
gonna help us do that.

527
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:12,107
Come on, we have to open our arms here,

528
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,201
and let some new family in,

529
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:16,952
especially now that
Spencer's stepping away.

530
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:21,720
Come on, let's just commit
to putting on a show

531
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:25,232
that everyone will remember
for the rest of their lives.

532
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:26,316
Okay?

533
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:29,368
Jane?

534
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,157
Does Aurora know?

535
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:37,209
Yes.

536
00:28:38,686 --> 00:28:39,769
Okay, then.

537
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:47,446
So, let me see what you've
been rehearsing up there.

538
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,090
Oh, we spent all morning in the air.

539
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,510
We're done.

540
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:53,094
Ah, but you've been resting,

541
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,453
partying, arguing about me.

542
00:28:57,746 --> 00:28:58,496
Come on.

543
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,949
Let me see it.

544
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:01,033
Please.

545
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:04,555
You good?

546
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,157
- Yeah.

Really great.

558
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:35,530
Just want to try something, though.

559
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:36,364
What's your name?

560
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:37,536
Iris.

561
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,071
I want you to switch with Hathaway.

562
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,805
Can they switch positions?

563
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:43,789
- Yeah.
- Okay.

564
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:44,928
Don't have to run the
whole thing, just want to see

565
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:46,762
what this looks like.

566
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:51,582
It's just those abs and those abs...

567
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:57,422
Creating symmetry, people.

568
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:01,852
Okay, thank you. Let's run it.

569
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:05,470
Jane, can you have Iris
hang on the hang thing

570
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,887
for just, like, two eights more?

571
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,998
Just till we hit blackout.

572
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:09,135
The meat hook?

573
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:10,619
Yeah.

574
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:11,703
I love you.

575
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,914
Okay, and music please.

576
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:21,207
I'm Zee.

577
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,541

591
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:48,946

Hey, this is a closed set.

595
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,632
- I thought...
- Not a word of this gets out,

596
00:31:00,716 --> 00:31:02,466
or all access is cut.

597
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,610
Hey.

598
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,650
Oh, come on, what's happening?

599
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:13,518
Did that hurt that much?

600
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:16,564
It didn't hurt me.

601
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:22,641
Oh, honey.

602
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:26,464
Oh, Iris, Iris.

603
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:39,125
So, she's good?

604
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:40,875
Yeah, she's pregnant,

605
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,528
so we're gonna need to
make some adjustments.

606
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:44,277
Well, what do you
mean "make some adjustments"?

607
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,455
Define "adjustments."

608
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,334
And another thing, when
I say we're done rehearsing

609
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:49,301
in the air, we're done
rehearsing in the air.

610
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, hold on, I didn't
hire the pregnant lady.

611
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:51,996
She's six weeks.

612
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,256
She didn't know she was gonna keep it.

613
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,969
Now she knows, we can make some changes.

614
00:31:55,053 --> 00:31:55,803
I'm sorry, no.

615
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:57,536
That is definitely not happening.

616
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,933
That is not a part of her contract

617
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,764
and it's not a part of the show.

618
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:05,848
Why are we even talking about
this, it's abs, abs, symmetry!

619
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,624
Okay, I might know a couple
of people who are available.

620
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,208
That's okay, I got this.

621
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,677
Wait, these are very specialized skills.

622
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,639
There aren't very many
dancers who can do aerials,

623
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,108
much less aerialists that can dance.

624
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:17,859
I said I got this.

625
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:29,041
You know, I was wondering
why you looked so good.

626
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,837
You remember Carmen
from the Brittany tour?

627
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,528
- Mm-hm.
- She's got two kids now.

628
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:33,467
- Right?
- You'll be fine.

629
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,883
- I know.
- Iris.

630
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,049
What size are you?

631
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,848
No, that motherfucker
is not trying to fit

632
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:41,512
someone else into your costume.

633
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:43,057
What the hell, man?

634
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:46,176
Hathaway, why do I think
we're gonna get along so great?

635
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,677
I have no idea.

636
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:54,882
Listen, I'm sorry that
Iris has to quit, and you do,

637
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:59,381
and I know that everyone
wanted to celebrate,

638
00:32:59,465 --> 00:33:01,264
but now we're a person short,

639
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:03,540
which means we have to find
and train a someone new,

640
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:06,201
and this is not me
being insensitive, okay?

641
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,583
She's known for, what, six weeks?

642
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,195
Dude, seriously.

643
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,779
Yeah, seriously.

644
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:14,347
So what's her size?

645
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:18,121
A zero, obviously.

646
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,205
Thank you.

647
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:23,527
Look, I'm just gonna put this all out here

648
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:25,808
just so we're all on the same page:

649
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:29,329
This show might've been a walk
in the park back in the day,

650
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:30,864
but not this time.

651
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,107
We are going to refresh the older numbers,

652
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:37,915
we're gonna add some new
ones, so eat your Wheaties,

653
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,888
lose some weight, drink your Ensure...

654
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:42,510
Hold up.

655
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:44,261
"Drink your Ensure"?

656
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:48,420
You Dunning-Kruger motherfucker.

657
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:49,254
Bianca.

658
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:50,594
You see what's he's doing, right?

659
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:53,277
I mean, they didn't send him
in here to tweak the show.

660
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:56,472
No, they brought this genius
in here to blow it up.

661
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:57,913
- Yup.
- Mm-hm.

662
00:33:57,997 --> 00:34:00,549
"Drink your Ensure"?

663
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:02,677
Bitch, I can run rings around you.

664
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:03,655
We all can.

665
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:06,761
She's right.

666
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,012
You know what?

667
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,016
Come on, Iris.

668
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:12,352
- No, Bianca...
- No, no, this girl's

669
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:17,436
got a real family going on,
I'm gonna go be a part of that,

670
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:19,940
'cause this one here is dead.

671
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,373
- Come on now, it's cool.
- You'll see.

672
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:22,675
Come on, Bianca.

673
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:23,842
You'll see.

674
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,522
Okay.

675
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:32,422
Anyone else?

676
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:33,310
You've said enough.

677
00:34:33,394 --> 00:34:34,613
Hey, if the wheels are gonna come off,

678
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,829
- I'd rather it be now.
- Oh, you want something

679
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:37,338
- to come off, buddy?
- Hey, okay, all right,

680
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:38,811
everybody calm down.

681
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:40,441
Bianca will change her mind.

682
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:41,399
Change her mind?

683
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:43,582
When has she ever done that?

684
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,583
Okay, we're on break.

685
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:48,124
Fuck.

686
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,686
Jane.

687
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,962
- Hey.
- He kicked me out.

688
00:34:55,046 --> 00:34:55,864
I'll get you back in tomorrow.

689
00:34:55,948 --> 00:34:56,837
Tell him you're my assistant.

690
00:34:56,921 --> 00:34:57,671
Well, what about tonight?

691
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:58,753
The interview?

692
00:34:58,837 --> 00:34:59,980
Tomorrow night, I promise.

693
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,529
Well, I can't, I've got a flight.

694
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,696
Can we just do this over the phone.

695
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:08,815
You gotta get down here.

696
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,219
Iris and Bianca just quit.

697
00:35:10,303 --> 00:35:12,093
This guy is toxic.

698
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,647
Look, I don't
know what to tell you.

699
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:15,632
Artists need to try new
things to stay relevant,

700
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:17,469
and this guy is the new thing.

701
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:18,303
Richard.

702
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:20,902
I'm sorry, but
everyone is expendable.

703
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,069
Expendable?

704
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:50,569
Hello?

705
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:51,499
Hi.

706
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,394
Is this Kelly?

707
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:53,808
Yeah, this is Kelly.

708
00:35:53,892 --> 00:35:55,509
Hey, Kelly, it's Jane.

709
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:56,969
I was calling Aurora.

710
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,532
Oh, I'm sorry,
she's not available.

711
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,491
Hey, I'm just curious,

712
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,524
this is her private line, isn't it?

713
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:05,674
It is, but
Richard changed her number,

714
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:07,287
he just wants her in the bubble.

715
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:10,567
He's got her on lockdown, no
distractions until we open.

716
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,773
Could you give me that number?

717
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:13,299
It's really important.

718
00:36:13,383 --> 00:36:15,996
I would, but you
can only get it from Richard.

719
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,111
I'm sorry.

720
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:18,083
Okay.

721
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,012
Thanks.

722
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,762
Take care.

723
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:25,897
I was 43 when I stopped
trying to have a baby.

724
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:28,430
A doctor told me I was too old.

725
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:30,863
Now Iris is having one at 43.

726
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:32,790
I have two now.

727
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:33,691
Somewhere.

728
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,798
I have a career.

729
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:38,384
I'm not gonna let that twerp burn it down.

730
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:41,049
The oldest aerialist in rock and roll.

731
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,068
You do know how dumb that sounds, right?

732
00:36:43,152 --> 00:36:44,146
It's what I got.

733
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,365
I mean, that's not even a category.

734
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:47,813
Anyway, I can't quit.

735
00:36:47,897 --> 00:36:49,294
I leased my place in Vegas.

736
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,081
Let me go ahead and
state the obvious here:

737
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:56,186
You're in a house you own.

738
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,976
Maybe it's time you got off the road.

739
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,810
And do what?

740
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:00,060
Give massages?

741
00:37:01,474 --> 00:37:02,624
Hey.

742
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:03,708
Hey.

743
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,732
I was in the hood

744
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:11,215
and wanted to talk to
you about what happened.

745
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:12,918
But I see you're busy, so.

746
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,474
Hey.

747
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:16,308
Catch you tomorrow.

748
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,513
Thank you, for the cake

749
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:24,894
and remembering.

750
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:31,222
That reporter was asking a
bunch of questions about you.

751
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:32,707
Seemed kinda personal.

752
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:36,958
I hope you don't mind I
just told her to fuck off.

753
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:54,286
I want one of
these everywhere I go today.

754
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,997
Did I miss a party?

755
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:57,645
Nope!

756
00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:00,178
Just fulfilling my destiny.

757
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:03,454
Someone's gotta bring up the rear.

758
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,531
Mm, nice voice.

759
00:38:12,215 --> 00:38:14,164
Compared to who?

760
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,112
I need to find some other
way to impress Mother.

761
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:19,417
I read some interviews
where she had nothing

762
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,830
but nice things to say about you.

763
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:26,747
Can you interview me so I
can get a message back to her?

764
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:31,814
What do you think of Jane?

765
00:38:31,898 --> 00:38:33,094
I think I like her better

766
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,011
when she's not playing second mom.

767
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:38,919
Oh, god.

768
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:40,993
So comfortable.

769
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,345
Hey, are you guys dancers on this show?

770
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,745
Thank you.

771
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,579
That is better than being carded.

772
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:55,304
Come on, dancer's are this way.

773
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:56,388
Let's go.

774
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,645
Good Morning.

775
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:17,727
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

776
00:39:17,811 --> 00:39:21,014
Had to do that for legal reasons.

777
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:23,836
But I guess, if you're
gonna do a story about Jane,

778
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,049
falling's gonna be part of it.

779
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,959
You have free reign today.

780
00:39:29,043 --> 00:39:29,793
Thank you.

781
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:32,503
On one condition, though:

782
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,188
If you solve the mystery

783
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:37,355
that is Jane Hawkins, please tell me.

784
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,060
Over drinks sometime.

785
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:42,144
Sure.

786
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:47,873
Hey, I'm Beth.

787
00:39:47,957 --> 00:39:49,550
Taylor.

788
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:51,467
That's Mom, I'm Dad.

Okay, so I know that the
choreography has been the same

797
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:28,155
for the last few tours,
but let's give it a twist.

798
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,723
Jane, Hathaway, in the
back, men in the middle,

799
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:32,890
Taylor and Beth up front.

800
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:37,324
I've been loving this
whole expressionistic flow.

801
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:39,991
It's like a greasy robot thing.

802
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,796
T-Bone, music.

Hey, hold, everyone.

811
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:03,682
Zee, can I...

812
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:05,204
Is there a problem?

813
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,538
No, I'm good.

814
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:10,598
These girls are beautiful dancers,

815
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:12,628
but I need to see if they can fly.

816
00:41:12,712 --> 00:41:14,076
So you want the room.

817
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,430
Yeah, and another thing...

818
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,034
Always another thing.

819
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:19,944
Have you thought about what these babies

820
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:22,466
are gonna look like next to Aurora?

821
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,457
It's the whole point.

822
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,708
This is not the Dinosaur Tour anymore.

823
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:33,826
What is the point of this?

824
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,649
To see how strong you are.

825
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:37,066
Beth, you're up.

826
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:41,466
I have great form.

827
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,130
What's the first thing
to go when you're weak?

828
00:41:44,214 --> 00:41:45,088
You're gonna say form.

829
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,172
Mm.

830
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,681
Great.

831
00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:54,946
All right, show me your form.

832
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:10,636
Take your time.

833
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,594
Safety first, okay?

834
00:42:11,678 --> 00:42:12,427
I know.

835
00:42:12,511 --> 00:42:13,511
I know.

836
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:26,480
Jane, honey?

837
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,144
Look what I found.

838
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:32,164
You're an archeologist, T-Buddy.

839
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:36,581
Yeah, well, let's just
show him what you got, huh?

840
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:47,475
Hey.

841
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:53,913
Hey.

842
00:42:53,997 --> 00:42:55,243
How they doing?

843
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:56,202
Beth is strong.

844
00:42:56,286 --> 00:42:58,028
Taylor not so much.

845
00:42:58,112 --> 00:43:00,131
Stick her in a circle thing.

846
00:43:00,215 --> 00:43:01,304
A lyra?

847
00:43:01,388 --> 00:43:03,865
I'm not putting anyone in
the air who isn't safe.

848
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,975
Look, putting dancers in the air

849
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:09,564
is supposed to be your thing, so do that.

850
00:43:09,648 --> 00:43:10,648
Please.

851
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:13,799

Huh?

867
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:37,891
That's not already in the show?

868
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:38,894
No, it got cut.

869
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:40,033
Nobody's ever seen it.

870
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:41,353
It's good, huh?

871
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:43,319
Yeah, it's fantastic.

872
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:44,634
Let's put the new girls in it.

873
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:45,855
What?

874
00:44:45,939 --> 00:44:47,737
You said yourself, Taylor's
a little physically weak,

875
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:49,369
so this will be perfect for her.

876
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,536
No, no, no.

877
00:44:52,337 --> 00:44:55,971
Does everything have to be a battle?

878
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:57,038
Okay.

879
00:44:57,122 --> 00:44:57,998
What the fuck?

880
00:44:58,082 --> 00:44:59,209
- No, it's good.
- This is our thing.

881
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:01,384
No, no, fuck that, no.

882
00:45:01,468 --> 00:45:03,237
Hathaway, I...

883
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:04,321
Jamal.

884
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,373
Beth, Taylor.

885
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:22,636
Now.

886
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,720
Climb up.

887
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,158
Climb up.

888
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:27,260
Go ahead.

889
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:28,344
Go up.

890
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:33,663
All right.

891
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,048
Twinkles.

892
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,215
- Darling.
- Mm.

893
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:38,067
Do me a favor?

894
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:39,151
Grab a mop.

895
00:45:40,182 --> 00:45:42,380
Oh, I'm not cleaning that up.

896
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:43,714
- No.
- Thank you.

897
00:45:52,454 --> 00:45:54,954
I don't need money this bad.

898
00:45:57,092 --> 00:45:59,375
We can't let this happen.

899
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:01,141
Yeah, you're gonna go
up, you're gonna go down

900
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,594
- and down there.
- No, yeah, I don't really,

901
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:03,678
no, just...

902
00:46:04,484 --> 00:46:06,583
No, I don't think we need,
just send me somebody...

903
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,223
A word with you, Satan?

904
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,553
Yeah, I'll just call you.

905
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:13,161
The fans know us as The Family

906
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:16,035
and we have been performing
for them for nearly 20 years,

907
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:18,516
and you come in here and
treat us like we're nothing?

908
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,599
- Okay, okay, hold on.
- That is not okay.

909
00:46:19,683 --> 00:46:21,667
- Hold on a second.
- No, he needs to hear this.

910
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:23,538
It's either us or him.

911
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:24,371
- Really?
- Yeah.

912
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:25,246
Yeah, really.

913
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,204
Bubba, okay, calm down.

914
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:27,202
Could you give us some space?

915
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:28,566
No, I kinda want to hear this.

916
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,776
Would you please come with me?

917
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,860
Come on.

918
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:37,069
The fans would've loved to
see Iris, just getting bigger,

919
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:38,868
and we could have had a dancer replace her

920
00:46:38,952 --> 00:46:40,433
- when the time comes.
- No, listen, listen...

921
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:42,332
Bianca, all she needed was for us

922
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,174
to say that The Fam is still The Fam.

923
00:46:44,258 --> 00:46:45,603
Bianca made her own choice.

924
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:47,151
Okay, well, then let's make ours.

925
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:48,585
It's either us or him.

926
00:46:48,669 --> 00:46:49,977
- We're going to Richard.
- Richard doesn't care.

927
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:51,405
That's what I'm trying to tell you...

928
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:52,390
Then we go to the diva.

929
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:54,222
No, I don't know that she cares.

930
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:56,052
Richard told me that all
of us are expendable,

931
00:46:56,136 --> 00:46:57,034
every single one of us.

932
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:58,430
- What?
- Yes, exactly.

933
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,634
And that means he is too.

934
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:04,225
If we say we're all outta here,
then Richard will fire him

935
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:05,574
- in a heartbeat.
- He won't.

936
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:06,657
He...
Come on, yes, he will.

937
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:07,491
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

938
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,833
No, no, no, no.

939
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:10,944
I can't. I can't.

940
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,248
Okay, Jane, come on.

941
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,535
We fight together.

942
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:14,848
I know you're scared, it's all right.

943
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,115
It's too risky, I can't.

944
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,532
Dammit, this doesn't work without you.

945
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:31,895
You'd really just let me go?

946
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:36,053
Please.

947
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:44,176
You have to destroy everything?

948
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:46,369
- Jane.
- Please,

949
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:47,471
- it's not that simple.
- Jane.

950
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:48,554
It's not.

951
00:47:48,638 --> 00:47:50,504
It really is.

952
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:51,588
Watch.

953
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:54,957
You suck.

954
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:56,336
I quit.

955
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,420
See? Simple.

956
00:48:04,524 --> 00:48:06,441
Is that it for today?

957
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:34,492
Hold tight.

958
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:45,844
Janie.

959
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:49,044
I wanna get down.

960
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:00,462
Come down.

961
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:02,705
Come down.

962
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:05,330
All right, come down easy.

963
00:49:05,414 --> 00:49:06,346
Come down easy.

964
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,180
All right, you're okay.

965
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:13,342
Okay.

966
00:49:13,426 --> 00:49:14,426
That's it, I'm done.

967
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,366
Don't go. Please.

968
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,532
I'm already gone.

969
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:17,585
Please, come on.

970
00:49:17,669 --> 00:49:19,504
You know, I was counting
on the money for this.

971
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,022
I already leased my apartment for this,

972
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:23,512
but, Jane, I'm not gonna do this!

973
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:27,617
And I can't believe I let them
go and I didn't follow them.

974
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:28,888
But you know what?

975
00:49:28,972 --> 00:49:31,889
It's because I always followed you!

976
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:22,729
Sure you still want to do this?

977
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:23,813
Yes.

978
00:50:26,075 --> 00:50:27,897
I felt I had to lie
about my age at first,

979
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:31,429
but then I really learned
that you can't tell

980
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:33,368
how old someone is on stage,

981
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:34,578
especially when they're in the air,

982
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:38,203
so I booked work in Vegas pretty quick.

983
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:41,077
And you reconnected with Serena.

984
00:50:41,161 --> 00:50:43,883
I saw some video of you two rehearsing.

985
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:45,395
Yeah.

986
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:47,686
You made the gymnastics
team for the 1980 Olympics.

987
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:50,192
And then Russia invaded Afghanistan.

988
00:50:50,276 --> 00:50:51,502
Ah, the boycott.

989
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:55,395
And you tried again in '84,
but ruptured your Achilles.

990
00:50:55,479 --> 00:50:58,674
Yeah, that's what I was known for.

991
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:00,374
But what happened after that?

992
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:02,625
You dropped off the radar.

993
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,830
Couple years of suicidal thoughts.

994
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:13,690
Can I show you something?

995
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,206
Where did you get this?

996
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,732
At the gymnastic
camp where you taught.

997
00:51:36,816 --> 00:51:38,931
This was how I bounced back.

998
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:40,907
You started performing.

999
00:51:40,991 --> 00:51:41,991
Mm.

1000
00:51:43,297 --> 00:51:46,242
I found one reference of you
training for the '88 Olympics

1001
00:51:46,326 --> 00:51:48,780
with a coach named Sergei Kilinski.

1002
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:50,559
Is that true?

1003
00:51:50,643 --> 00:51:51,643
Yes.

1004
00:51:52,635 --> 00:51:55,581
So you were trying
for your third Olympics.

1005
00:51:55,665 --> 00:51:57,583
It's all I knew how to do.

1006
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,295
I was too old, probably.

1007
00:52:00,379 --> 00:52:02,459
I didn't realize how much
the sport was changing,

1008
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:05,210
it was getting tougher, younger.

1009
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,126
The young girls can do these crazy tricks.

1010
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,485
Their center of gravity is higher.

1011
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:13,652
They don't have any hips.

1012
00:52:17,855 --> 00:52:21,022
I'm sorry, it's my own private summer.

1013
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:23,359
Sergei was expensive.

1014
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,298
How did you afford him?

1015
00:52:25,382 --> 00:52:28,455
I had a sponsorship with IGC.

1016
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:29,394
A sponsorship?

1017
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:32,417
Well, I didn't have
him that long, anyway.

1018
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:34,252
When I didn't make it to
the trials, I walked away.

1019
00:52:34,336 --> 00:52:35,503
I got married.

1020
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:39,133
I'm sorry about your ex.

1021
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,642
David would sit right
where you're sitting.

1022
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:46,403
Did you ever want to have kids?

1023
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:50,320
Let's not make the
article about that stuff.

1024
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:52,707
You called the dancers your family.

1025
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:53,921
They are.

1026
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,162
Family is important to you.

1027
00:52:55,246 --> 00:52:57,153
Sure.

1028
00:52:57,237 --> 00:53:00,030
Then why didn't you fight for them?

1029
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:01,500
Excuse me?

1030
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:03,181
Seems like you could have today.

1031
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:04,025
You know what?

1032
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:06,289
I think it's time for sleep.

1033
00:53:06,373 --> 00:53:09,142
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm just
trying to get inside your head

1034
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:11,220
so I can paint the right picture.

1035
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:12,683
You're clearly very driven.

1036
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,733
Your life reflects that.

1037
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,724
You seem to choose career
over relationships, though,

1038
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:19,929
which I'm not judging, I'm
just trying to figure out

1039
00:53:20,013 --> 00:53:21,128
whether you're naturally a loner

1040
00:53:21,212 --> 00:53:22,503
or whether you wanted family

1041
00:53:22,587 --> 00:53:24,847
and it didn't work...
I want to go to sleep.

1042
00:53:26,043 --> 00:53:27,043
Okay.

1043
00:53:29,642 --> 00:53:31,534
You do realize that I'm
trying to write an article

1044
00:53:31,618 --> 00:53:35,120
about you, the person, not
just the stuff you've done.

1045
00:53:35,204 --> 00:53:36,273
I need more from you than stuff

1046
00:53:36,357 --> 00:53:39,330
I could get off the internet, so please,

1047
00:53:39,414 --> 00:53:44,305
I'm sorry to get intense here,
but I've come a long way.

1048
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:46,306
Let me in a little bit.

1049
00:53:48,304 --> 00:53:53,054
I'm sorry if you're the
latest person I let down today.

1050
00:53:58,521 --> 00:54:00,688
Thank you for your time.

1051
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:05,323
What kind of story are you writing?

1052
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:07,551
I was hoping a good one.

1053
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:10,361
Might be too late for that.

1054
00:54:10,445 --> 00:54:15,445

What the hell?

1063
00:54:43,393 --> 00:54:45,631
I wanted to bring the
kids in for early rehearsal.

1064
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,076
You already know the choreography.

1065
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,881
Actually, I'm kinda changing it.

1066
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:52,223
There are seven of them.

1067
00:54:52,307 --> 00:54:56,189
Warm up, jump in the
back when you're ready.

1068

All right, from the top.

1071
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:31,090
Sergei was expensive.

1072
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,006
How did you afford him?

1073
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:36,258
I had a sponsorship with IGC.

1074
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:37,553
A sponsorship?

1075
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:40,584
Well, I didn't have
him that long, anyway.

1076
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:42,409
When I didn't make it to
the trials, I walked away.

1077
00:55:42,493 --> 00:55:43,243
I got married.

1078
00:55:43,327 --> 00:55:46,826
Eight, and spin it, two, three, four, hup!

1079
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:49,312
Up, up, up, up, up!

1080
00:55:49,396 --> 00:55:50,808
Up, stand up!

1081
00:55:50,892 --> 00:55:52,967
I didn't say splits.

1082
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:54,051
And splits.

1083
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:04,281
Seven, eight, back to double stag.

1084
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:05,590
Find it, find it.

1085
00:56:05,674 --> 00:56:06,881
Beth, more arch, more arch.

1086
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:08,209
Straighten your legs,
straighten your legs.

1087
00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:09,376
Okay, hop up.

1088
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:12,188
Everybody ready?

1089
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:13,187
Pencil spin.

1090
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:14,784
Hands on, beautiful sous sous.

1091
00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:15,805
Gorgeous.

1092
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:17,013
Beautiful.

1093
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:19,605
Try looking like you enjoy
it, that would be nice.

1094
00:56:19,689 --> 00:56:21,713
Hi, yes, I'm trying
to find some information

1095
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:23,804
about the past IGC sponsorships.

1096
00:56:23,888 --> 00:56:25,468
I called earlier.

1097
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:27,528
Yeah, yeah, I'll hold.

Okay.

1103
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,108
Thank you for going to the trouble.

1104
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,327
I saw you once, in
Vegas, when I was a kid

1105
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:15,338
and I told my mom, "That's
what I want to do,"

1106
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:16,805
but she wasn't having it,

1107
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:20,068
not after she saw your friend fall.

1108
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:21,316
Ah.

1109
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,270
So I'm kinda getting a late start.

1110
00:57:23,354 --> 00:57:27,407
I was 42 when I started,
so you're not late.

1111
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:28,491
Jump up.

1112
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:32,497
So what
have you done to yourself?

1113
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:33,571
I don't know.

1114
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:35,703
I stopped going to see doctors.

1115
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:37,781
You do know that I'm a doctor, yes?

1116
00:57:37,865 --> 00:57:38,993
Resist.

1117
00:57:39,077 --> 00:57:41,827
Well, I know that you helped Serena, so.

1118
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:43,411
Mm-hm. This way.

1119
00:57:45,138 --> 00:57:46,137
This way.

1120
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:48,279
Yes, I did help Serena.

1121
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:50,268
Lay on your stomach.

1122
00:57:50,352 --> 00:57:52,185
That was hard for her.

1123
00:57:53,352 --> 00:57:54,897
She had to stop.

1124
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:56,899
I wouldn't tell you to stop.

1125
00:57:56,983 --> 00:57:59,438
Plus, athletes never listen anyway.

1126
00:57:59,522 --> 00:58:02,813
They push through, until they break.

1127
00:58:05,525 --> 00:58:08,640
I don't think it's age with
you, I think it's injury.

1128
00:58:08,724 --> 00:58:10,782
Age is an injury

1129
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:12,699
Oh, so this is it?

1130
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:13,943
Yeah.

1131
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:15,513
Any other big falls?

1132
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:18,789
I was attempting an Omelianchik on beam.

1133
00:58:18,873 --> 00:58:20,637
Well, what would possess you to do that?

1134
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:22,097
I was young and stupid.

1135
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:23,195
Can you turn over for me?

1136
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:28,115
That is not a move somebody
does in their spare time.

1137
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:30,292
I was training for '88.

1138
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:32,872
Oh, you were trying
to get back in there.

1139
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:34,206
Mm-hm.

1140
00:58:36,276 --> 00:58:39,684
Oh, you fell, you landed right here.

1141
00:58:39,768 --> 00:58:40,945
Yes.

1142
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:42,871
I thought so.

1143
00:58:42,955 --> 00:58:44,538
How can you tell?

1144
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,028
The body remembers.

1145
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:17,101
Hey.

1146
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:18,518
What's going on?

1147
01:02:20,424 --> 01:02:21,424
You okay?

1148
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:24,124
I've done everything wrong.

1149
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:25,696
I made the wrong choices.

1150
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,873
Hey now.

1151
01:02:26,957 --> 01:02:29,240
I did it to myself.

1152
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,010
The body remembers, and
it never forgave me.

1153
01:02:33,094 --> 01:02:34,805
Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1154
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,496
I don't have anybody.

1155
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,374
I'm alone.

1156
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,541
Hey, I count, a little.

1157
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:43,333
And you've got your dancing family.

1158
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:45,686
No, I let them down.

1159
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,395
I let everybody down.

1160
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:49,424
Everyone lets everyone down,

1161
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:50,600
says or does something stupid.

1162
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,206
That's what families do.

1163
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,623
It's too late.

1164
01:02:55,337 --> 01:02:56,435
Maybe not.

1165
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,909
I mean, if it really was a family,

1166
01:02:58,993 --> 01:03:00,866
there's gotta be some forgiveness there,

1167
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,369
if it's worth anything.

1168
01:03:02,453 --> 01:03:04,728
Like, I'm forgiving you right now

1169
01:03:04,812 --> 01:03:06,304
for getting snot on my favorite shirt.

1170
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,247
Hey, hey.

1171
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:11,331
Really.

1172
01:03:13,061 --> 01:03:17,239
The family you choose,
you can choose again.

1173
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:51,193
Hey, Hollis.

1174
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:53,171
Hey, hummingbird.

1175
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:54,663
I just need a minute with her.

1176
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,428
Can't, she's in the bubble right now.

1177
01:03:56,512 --> 01:03:58,095
Have you heard about The Fam?

1178
01:03:58,179 --> 01:03:59,319
No.

1179
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:02,686
All gone, everyone, except me.

1180
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:04,270

1181
01:04:07,153 --> 01:04:07,999
You know what?

1182
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:11,104
He can try to get rid of me too.

1183
01:04:11,188 --> 01:04:12,188
Thank you.

You're supposed to be rehearsing.

1188
01:04:34,312 --> 01:04:36,315
The show we're working
on isn't her show anymore,

1189
01:04:36,399 --> 01:04:38,466
and I think she should know it.

1190
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,316
She does know.

1191
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,275
Hollis doesn't know.

1192
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:43,055
That means she doesn't know.

1193
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:45,320
You know what?

1194
01:04:45,404 --> 01:04:48,958
I don't have to explain this to you.

1195
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:50,719
We need to cut overhead.

1196
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,944
It's just business.

1197
01:04:53,028 --> 01:04:56,144
You didn't want to
buy out our contracts,

1198
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:57,876
so you want us to quit.

1199
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,627
You need us to quit.

1200
01:05:00,995 --> 01:05:02,865
It's her last tour.

1201
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:06,920
People are gonna come no
matter what kind of show it is,

1202
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,254
or who's in it.

1203

01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:34,771
but don't party too hard... Taylor.

1212
01:05:36,939 --> 01:05:38,133
All right, we gotta big week coming up,

1213
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:39,944
Aurora is here on Friday!

1214
01:05:40,028 --> 01:05:41,767
Woo, woo!

1215
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:44,306
So start getting it in your
brains that, when she's here,

1216
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,802
you don't make eye contact with her.

1217
01:05:45,886 --> 01:05:46,932
Okay?

1218
01:05:47,016 --> 01:05:48,016
Skedaddle.

1219
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,912
Jane!

1220
01:05:50,996 --> 01:05:52,163
Yeah?

1221
01:05:54,748 --> 01:05:56,085
I want to be really clear on this,

1222
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:59,393
so I'm gonna make eye contact
with you: I'm the director.

1223
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:00,444
You got a problem, you come to me,

1224
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:03,903
you don't go over my head, ever.

1225
01:06:03,987 --> 01:06:05,633
Well, I'm the aerial choreographer,

1226
01:06:05,717 --> 01:06:09,300
so I'm kind of over
your head all the time.

1227
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:14,463
I'm cutting your solo.

1228
01:06:44,727 --> 01:06:46,471
I could drop a motor on him.

1229
01:06:46,555 --> 01:06:48,555
Insurance will cover it.

1230
01:06:55,452 --> 01:06:56,639
Our girl deserves better.

1231
01:06:56,723 --> 01:06:57,515
She does.

1232
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,015
Mm-hm.

1233
01:07:00,222 --> 01:07:02,182
Do you still have
the keys to this place?

1234
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:03,679
Mm-hm.

1235
01:07:03,763 --> 01:07:07,430
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1236
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:11,850
I'm thinking, "How is
it we're the same age?"

1237
01:07:15,123 --> 01:07:17,214
You were right.

1238
01:07:25,227 --> 01:07:26,227
Oh, my god.

1239
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:28,577
I miss you.

1240
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:31,765
I missed you too.

1241
01:07:41,053 --> 01:07:43,042
You're glowing.

1242
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:44,709
I'm not nauseous.

1243
01:08:01,652 --> 01:08:03,485
Hathaway, you home?!

1244
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:18,029
Come on.

1245
01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:23,058
Now the road's gonna go on with out us,

1246
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:25,475
be like we were never there.

1247
01:08:26,573 --> 01:08:30,156
I wonder if Aurora is
even going to notice.

1248
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:34,856
So, who was that guy
with the greasy hands?

1249
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:37,647
Don't tell me he was a masseuse.

1250
01:08:37,731 --> 01:08:38,935
I'm not buying it.

1251
01:08:39,019 --> 01:08:40,186
My neighbor.

1252
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:43,117
No.

1253
01:08:44,558 --> 01:08:47,035
If I've been running cold lately,

1254
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:50,952
it's because I am so
very, very goddamned hot.

1255
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:54,907

1256
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,137
Ah.

1257
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:01,471
It's not you.

01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:03,706
Wow.

1259
01:09:06,121 --> 01:09:07,121
Wow.

1260
01:09:07,797 --> 01:09:09,380

01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:57,087
Eight.

01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,209

1299
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:01,043

01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:37,511
Lip-sync.

1326
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:43,972
Hey, I want the circle things, the lyras,

1327
01:12:45,105 --> 01:12:47,536
to spin in the opposite
direction when the chorus hits.

1328
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,620
No.

1329
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:51,433
No?

1330
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:52,527
No, it's not possible.

1331
01:12:52,611 --> 01:12:54,194
I mean, physically.

1332
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,648
Were you under the
impression those are motorized,

1333
01:12:57,732 --> 01:12:59,921
because they're on swivels.

1334
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:03,613
It's momentum that's making
these young'uns spin around.

1335
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:07,432
It's nothing else but mass times velocity.

1336
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,898
Can't just change the laws of physics

1337
01:13:09,982 --> 01:13:12,640
when the chorus hits, kid.

1338
01:13:12,724 --> 01:13:14,726
I actually had to Google Dunning-Kruger.

1339
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:15,902
You know what?

1340
01:13:15,986 --> 01:13:17,430
You're fired.

1341
01:13:17,514 --> 01:13:18,764
Pack your shit!

1342
01:13:19,757 --> 01:13:21,847
All right, that's
it, everyone take 30.

1343
01:13:23,075 --> 01:13:23,825
30?

1344
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:26,917
Jane!

1345
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:28,418
- Oh, god.
- Jane!

1346
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:31,297
You're not running this show.

1347
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:32,832
I can make a safety call anytime.

1348
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:33,863
Check my contract.

1349
01:13:33,947 --> 01:13:34,738
Yeah, well, it's in my contract

1350
01:13:34,822 --> 01:13:35,572
that I'm the director,

1351
01:13:35,656 --> 01:13:37,294
which means I get some goddamn respect!

1352
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:38,735
You think that?!

1353
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:39,883
Yes!

1354
01:13:39,967 --> 01:13:43,161
For fuck's sake, what is your problem?

1355
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:44,746
You're supposed to be a team player.

1356
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,346
Richard said, "Don't worry about Jane."

1357
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,180
He did?

1358
01:13:47,264 --> 01:13:49,611
Yeah, but all I have is
Jane all up in my face,

1359
01:13:49,695 --> 01:13:51,513
contradicting me in front of everybody,

1360
01:13:51,597 --> 01:13:52,445
shitting on my ideas,

1361
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:53,946
and shutting down my fucking rehearsals.

1362
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,279
I'm actually trying to help you.

1363
01:13:56,363 --> 01:14:00,190
Oh, because you think that
I don't know what I'm doing.

1364
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:02,353
I've choreographed quite
a few tours before.

1365
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:03,478
Not with this many elements.

1366
01:14:03,562 --> 01:14:04,312
Not with aerials.

1367
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:06,540
Yeah, but I have the vision.

1368
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:07,942
That's why I got the gig.

1369
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,212
That's why I get respect.

1370
01:14:09,296 --> 01:14:10,296
Got it?

1371
01:14:12,858 --> 01:14:15,027
Okay, just listen to people

1372
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:16,835
with more experience than you, okay?

1373
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:18,247
Just do that.

1374
01:14:18,331 --> 01:14:19,391
- Oh, just try that.
- Mm-hm.

1375
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:21,975
Learn from the ancient ones.

1376
01:14:24,997 --> 01:14:28,052
You know what your problem is?

1377
01:14:28,136 --> 01:14:29,636
You want this gig.

1378
01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:31,769
Get over it.

1379
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:34,594
Fire me.

1380
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:37,238
Go ahead. Fire me.

1381
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:39,438
You can't, you can't.

1382
01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:41,513
You can't do what I do.

1383
01:14:41,597 --> 01:14:43,117
You cut my solo, for what?

1384
01:14:43,201 --> 01:14:44,968
To get back at me?

1385
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:47,215
You just lost your costume change.

1386
01:14:47,299 --> 01:14:50,246
- Okay, well...
- You can't fire T-Bone.

1387
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:52,484
He's the most important
person on this tour.

1388
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:55,225
They would fire you a hundred
times before they fired him,

1389
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:58,127
and the reason you don't know
that is because you're green.

1390
01:14:58,211 --> 01:15:00,712
You don't know how a tour works,
you don't know how I work,

1391
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:02,715
and you certainly don't know how close

1392
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:05,487
you just came to losing an arm.

1393
01:15:05,571 --> 01:15:08,191
You grind me down without a clue

1394
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:11,787
that I am the best person
to have in your corner.

1395
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:13,464
And the worst part about it is,

1396
01:15:13,548 --> 01:15:17,243
you have no fucking clue
that you're being used.

1397
01:15:38,715 --> 01:15:39,798
Hey.

1398
01:15:42,697 --> 01:15:43,780
Still here?

1399
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:49,478
I'm sorry about the other night.

1400
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,213
Is that it?

1401
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,964
Is that the article?

1402
01:15:55,243 --> 01:15:56,975
Why did you lie to me?

1403
01:15:57,884 --> 01:15:58,934
I lied to you?

1404
01:15:59,018 --> 01:16:00,622
When you said you had a
sponsorship with the IGC.

1405
01:16:00,706 --> 01:16:01,695
I did have a sponsorship with the IGC.

1406
01:16:01,779 --> 01:16:02,790
With the IGC.

1407
01:16:02,874 --> 01:16:03,906
No, I mean for '88.

1408
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,073
I checked and you didn't.

1409
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:09,505
Maybe my memory's failing too.

1410
01:16:09,589 --> 01:16:11,976
Is that something I should write about?

1411
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,661
What is your deal?

1412
01:16:13,745 --> 01:16:16,693
I agreed to a story about
my aerial career, that's it.

1413
01:16:16,777 --> 01:16:19,042
But you're digging into my history,

1414
01:16:19,126 --> 01:16:22,028
asking everyone questions that
are none of your business.

1415
01:16:22,112 --> 01:16:22,987
It's a story about you, Jane.

1416
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:24,262
Of course I'm gonna ask questions.

1417
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,991
But why stuck on the past?

1418
01:16:26,075 --> 01:16:27,075
Why?

1419
01:16:27,745 --> 01:16:29,110
I wanted to know how you got here.

1420
01:16:29,194 --> 01:16:30,415
And why focus on my failure

1421
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,530
trying to get into the Olympics?

1422
01:16:32,614 --> 01:16:33,853
It's your gymnastics career.

1423
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:35,097
How is that off base to ask?

1424
01:16:35,181 --> 01:16:37,984
Because I don't want
my entire life exposed.

1425
01:16:38,068 --> 01:16:41,017
It's just background information.

1426
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:42,159
Fine.

1427
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:43,432
Totally off the record,

1428
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,882
but how did a young woman
with no affiliation,

1429
01:16:45,966 --> 01:16:47,569
sponsors, or financial support

1430
01:16:47,653 --> 01:16:50,312
pay for a top coach like Sergei Kilinski?

1431
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:57,094
Are you even a reporter?

1432
01:16:57,178 --> 01:16:58,498
- What?
- You wanna know

1433
01:16:58,582 --> 01:17:01,404
how much money I had, how
I could afford Sergei,

1434
01:17:01,488 --> 01:17:02,912
you're looking for dirt
in my personal life.

1435
01:17:02,996 --> 01:17:04,983
Are you working for Gayle?

1436
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:06,815
- Who?
- Gayle Bishop.

1437
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:09,983
- I don't know...
- My ex-husband's widow.

1438
01:17:10,067 --> 01:17:11,429
- I don't know her...
- I don't owe Gayle

1439
01:17:11,513 --> 01:17:12,666
a damn thing.

1440
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:13,960
Tell her to back off.

1441
01:17:14,044 --> 01:17:15,108
- Jane...
- And if she thinks

1442
01:17:15,192 --> 01:17:17,767
that I have assets that she can have,

1443
01:17:17,851 --> 01:17:19,736
she is out of her tiny mind.

1444
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:24,153
I never had any money,
especially after my Achilles.

1445
01:17:25,716 --> 01:17:28,169
You wanna know how I paid for Sergei?

1446
01:17:28,253 --> 01:17:29,503
I sold my eggs.

1447
01:17:30,425 --> 01:17:32,324
And it was the worst thing I ever did.

1448
01:17:32,408 --> 01:17:34,304
So whatever it is you're up to,

1449
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,815
whatever's written there, just stop.

1450
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:38,399
This story's over.

1451
01:18:12,447 --> 01:18:15,006
Told you she was in a bad mood.

1452
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,130
I can help you.

1453
01:18:16,214 --> 01:18:18,085
Get you a scoop.

1454
01:18:18,169 --> 01:18:20,866
"An insider look at today's
most secretive pop star."

1455
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:23,533
Come on, no reporter gets that.

1456
01:18:25,253 --> 01:18:28,304
I'll sneak you into tomorrow,
to Aurora's show and tell.

1457
01:18:28,388 --> 01:18:30,433
You can at least get
something out of this.

1458
01:18:30,517 --> 01:18:32,985
You definitely don't need Jane.

1459
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:34,069
Thank you.

1460
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,908
Did you learn anything?

1461
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:38,039
Is she dating somebody?

1462
01:18:38,123 --> 01:18:40,295
Is she a martial artist?

1463
01:18:40,379 --> 01:18:43,301
Did she give you any hint
that she wants to retire?

1464
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,826
I would like to know that.

1465
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,720
She's focused on her career.

1466
01:18:47,804 --> 01:18:51,078
She doesn't have time for anything else.

1467
01:18:51,162 --> 01:18:53,382
How long can that last?

1468
01:18:53,466 --> 01:18:55,383
Because she's so old?

1469
01:18:57,807 --> 01:18:59,577
Because she's so injured.

1470
01:18:59,661 --> 01:19:01,328
You haven't noticed?

1471
01:19:09,048 --> 01:19:10,663
Get some sleep, everybody.

1472
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:12,463
Remember, tomorrow, eyes down.

1473
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,397
T-Bone, thank you so much
for your continued services.

1474
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:15,406
Mea culpa.

1475
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:16,490
Goodnight.

1476
01:19:17,903 --> 01:19:18,653
Easy.

1477
01:19:18,737 --> 01:19:20,173
You were right, I need to listen more.

1478
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:22,127
Okay, well, let's just
make a good show, all right?

1479
01:19:22,211 --> 01:19:23,809
Yeah, and the thing you
said about the costume change,

1480
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:24,968
yeah, I screwed up.

1481
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,496
Okay, obviously, your
solo still has to go in.

1482
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,915
The only thing, I
haven't actually seen it,

1483
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,666
and right now, I really need to.

1484
01:19:45,566 --> 01:19:49,020
This is when
I'm over the audience.

1485
01:19:49,104 --> 01:19:52,854
The dancer pulls in the
fabric and I offload.

1486
01:19:55,393 --> 01:19:56,393
We actually need to extend

1487
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:58,342
this moment just a bit.

1488
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,923
No, no, it fits
perfectly with the music.

1489
01:20:01,007 --> 01:20:02,999
No, I added a headdress to her costume,

1490
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:05,583
so it's gonna take a little bit more time.

1491
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,151
Can you vamp on it, or something?

1492
01:20:08,915 --> 01:20:09,767
Just vamp a bit.

1493
01:20:09,851 --> 01:20:10,920
- Okay.
- Just extend it out.

1494
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:12,171
Okay.

1495
01:20:38,029 --> 01:20:39,028
That enough?

1496
01:20:39,112 --> 01:20:40,077
We just need a little bit longer.

1497
01:20:40,161 --> 01:20:41,161
Keep going.

1498
01:20:43,523 --> 01:20:45,172
We'll make the music match, don't worry.

1499
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:46,922
Okay.

1500
01:20:57,931 --> 01:20:58,777
Almost there.

1501
01:20:58,861 --> 01:20:59,770
Okay.

1502
01:21:11,277 --> 01:21:12,305
Good?

1503
01:21:12,389 --> 01:21:14,659
No, no, no, keep going.

1504
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:16,117
Okay.

1505
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,153
Keep going.

1506
01:21:31,237 --> 01:21:32,654
I can't.

1507
01:21:35,886 --> 01:21:37,258
I gotta come down.

1508
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:12,289
You really were a time bomb, Hawkins.

1509
01:22:13,549 --> 01:22:17,466
Good thing that didn't
happen on the tour, huh?

1510
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,271
You want me to call 9-1-1?

1511
01:22:27,256 --> 01:22:28,256
No.

1512
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,860
- Need to go to the hospital?
- No.

1513
01:22:59,944 --> 01:23:00,944
No.

1514
01:23:13,806 --> 01:23:14,806
Dislocated.

1515
01:23:37,201 --> 01:23:38,491
MRI in the morning.

1516
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,428
My guess, surgery in six weeks.

1517
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:48,878
Can you move your fingers?

1518
01:23:50,116 --> 01:23:52,765
- No.
- That may come back.

1519
01:23:52,849 --> 01:23:54,811
But right now, your body's
making a decision for you.

1520
01:23:54,895 --> 01:23:56,984
It wants you to stop

1521
01:23:57,068 --> 01:24:00,401
and you have no say in the matter, okay?

1522
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:03,065
Right now, your biggest healing tool

1523
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:05,316
is right there, so use it.

1524
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:17,008
Oh, the director
said I could watch.

1525
01:24:17,092 --> 01:24:20,088
Sorry, you're
incorrect, 'cause now, it's my set.

1526
01:24:20,172 --> 01:24:21,423
But he promised me.

1527
01:24:21,507 --> 01:24:22,256
It's really important...
Hey.

1528
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:23,090
That I'm here.

1529
01:24:23,174 --> 01:24:26,233
Hey, no, it's cool,
she's gonna hang in the back.

1530
01:24:26,317 --> 01:24:27,650
No, she's not.

1531
01:24:29,073 --> 01:24:31,906
Ma'am, please collect your things.

1532
01:24:35,463 --> 01:24:37,880
Well, my car is blocked in.

1533
01:24:40,235 --> 01:24:43,333
All right, well, you're just
gonna have to wait upstairs.

1534
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:44,326
I'm sorry, let's go.

Where are the aerials in that number?

1545
01:25:54,016 --> 01:25:55,745
I wanted to
keep it on the ground,

1546
01:25:55,829 --> 01:25:57,783
you know, just keep the focus on you.

1547
01:25:57,867 --> 01:26:00,537
No, no, I don't
want the focus on me.

1548
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:01,690
Put the aerials back.

1549
01:26:01,774 --> 01:26:03,520
And that's your choreography?

1550
01:26:03,604 --> 01:26:06,160
Yes, but I was trying to...

1551
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,504
emulate Spencer's style.

1552
01:26:08,588 --> 01:26:11,634
Oh, honey, I
don't know what you were...

1553
01:26:11,718 --> 01:26:12,900
What's up?

1554
01:26:12,984 --> 01:26:13,900
How you doing?

1555
01:26:13,984 --> 01:26:15,705
What's up, bro?

1556
01:26:15,789 --> 01:26:17,872
Hi, how are you, sweetie?

1557
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:22,198
My man.

1558
01:26:23,693 --> 01:26:25,223
You okay?

1559
01:26:25,307 --> 01:26:27,057
Hey, what happened?

1560
01:26:35,326 --> 01:26:37,221
Richard, what's going on here?

1561
01:26:37,305 --> 01:26:38,343
It's a new approach.

1562
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:39,984
We just need time to adjust.

1563
01:26:40,068 --> 01:26:42,967
There hasn't even
been a single costume change!

1564
01:26:43,051 --> 01:26:44,656
What am I supposed to
do, prance around nake...

1565
01:26:47,795 --> 01:26:49,026
What's your name?

1566
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:49,860
Runa.

1567
01:26:49,944 --> 01:26:52,868
Give me the phone now, Runa.

1568
01:26:52,952 --> 01:26:54,384
Now.

1569
01:26:54,468 --> 01:26:56,187
I'm sorry, I didn't
know I couldn't listen.

1570
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:57,271
Let's go.

1571
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:05,141
No, no.

1572
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:16,980
I thought we were done.

1573
01:27:17,064 --> 01:27:18,144
What's next?

1574
01:27:18,228 --> 01:27:19,410
The car's waiting,

1575
01:27:19,494 --> 01:27:21,276
but T-Bone says there's one
more number for you to watch.

1576
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,750
Uh, no there isn't.

1577
01:27:22,834 --> 01:27:23,634
Hey, Zee.

1578
01:27:23,718 --> 01:27:25,104
No, this is my set, okay?

1579
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:26,355
- Quiet.

01:27:35,173 --> 01:27:37,340

You're singing again.

1631
01:31:33,807 --> 01:31:35,057
A little bit.

1632
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:38,788
Will you come home tonight?

1633
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,185
You'll come home too?

1634
01:31:42,269 --> 01:31:43,069
Yeah, baby.

1635
01:31:43,153 --> 01:31:44,735
I'll come home too.

1636
01:31:46,462 --> 01:31:47,712
Janie, my love.

1637
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:49,467
What happened to you?

1638
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:50,837
Are we working you too hard?

1639
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:52,071
Oh, she's been working us.

1640
01:31:52,155 --> 01:31:54,729
Midnight rehearsals all week to do this.

1641
01:31:54,813 --> 01:31:56,309
We won't all be able to come with you,

1642
01:31:56,393 --> 01:31:58,384
but we wanted to give
you a proper farewell.

1643
01:31:58,468 --> 01:32:00,305
What do you mean, "farewell"?

1644
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:01,985
Why can't you come?

1645
01:32:02,069 --> 01:32:04,650
Well, Iris is pregnant, for starters.

1646
01:32:04,734 --> 01:32:05,484
You slut!

1647
01:32:06,878 --> 01:32:08,476
But I can still dance.

1648
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,657
Then you're coming.

1649
01:32:09,741 --> 01:32:11,742
- Ah!
- And what's your excuse?

1650
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:13,806
Well, we didn't fit the new vision.

1651
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:15,600
Yeah, we're not of the new breed.

1652
01:32:15,684 --> 01:32:18,398
Basically, we were
told we we're too old.

1653
01:32:18,482 --> 01:32:20,258
- Too old?
- Mm.

1654
01:32:20,342 --> 01:32:21,871
Who's too old?

1655
01:32:21,955 --> 01:32:25,325
Well, to be clear, I never
said anyone was too old,

1656
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:27,282
I was just told to bring
the show up to date.

1657
01:32:27,366 --> 01:32:28,697
Up to date?

1658
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:30,824
Yeah, but I agree, that
number was fantastic,

1659
01:32:30,908 --> 01:32:33,158
and we are gonna put it in.

1660
01:32:34,308 --> 01:32:38,154
"Up to date" is your little
euphemism for "saving money."

1661
01:32:38,238 --> 01:32:41,275
Richard, I want The
Family back in the show.

1662
01:32:42,856 --> 01:32:45,265
And these new young dancers?

1663
01:32:45,349 --> 01:32:47,347
They have been working so hard,

1664
01:32:47,431 --> 01:32:49,206
and look at how cute they are.

1665
01:32:50,455 --> 01:32:52,590
Let's bring them too.

1666
01:32:52,674 --> 01:32:53,821
We can talk about it.

1667
01:32:53,905 --> 01:32:55,473
We are talking.

1668
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:57,129
And while we're talking,

1669
01:32:57,213 --> 01:33:01,296
The Family already has
one really great director.

1670
01:33:02,552 --> 01:33:05,749
And we don't need another one.

1671
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:09,583
Yeah!

1672
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:16,330
You know I can't hit
certain high notes anymore,

1673
01:33:16,414 --> 01:33:20,153
so maybe you don't go so high, either.

1674
01:33:20,237 --> 01:33:22,799
But you are not quitting.

1675
01:33:22,883 --> 01:33:24,466
She's not quitting.

1676
01:33:26,848 --> 01:33:28,641
Okay, now, you and I are gonna talk.

1677
01:33:28,725 --> 01:33:30,162
Okay, hold on, I was just doing

1678
01:33:30,246 --> 01:33:31,577
- whatever you told me to do.
- Hey, Zee.

1679
01:33:31,661 --> 01:33:32,951
Let's take a walk, man.

1680
01:33:33,035 --> 01:33:34,277
Outside.

1681
01:33:40,647 --> 01:33:41,929
- Come on.
- Ooh!

1682
01:33:42,013 --> 01:33:46,596
We're a family!

1683
01:33:53,278 --> 01:33:55,278
Welcome to the family!

1684
01:34:12,104 --> 01:34:14,077
You should take a break to heal.

1685
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:15,716
How are you supposed to
get the show together

1686
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,759
if your body's not together?

1687
01:34:17,843 --> 01:34:19,296
I'm fine.

1688
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:20,974
You always say that.

1689
01:34:21,058 --> 01:34:22,144
Anyway, I was able to get

1690
01:34:22,228 --> 01:34:23,755
an extra week of rehearsal in Nice,

1691
01:34:23,839 --> 01:34:26,414
so hopefully, we'll able to
work the kinks out there.

1692
01:34:26,498 --> 01:34:28,881
Either way, the show must go on.

1693
01:34:28,965 --> 01:34:29,757
Okay.

1694
01:34:29,841 --> 01:34:31,191
What about this show?

1695
01:34:31,275 --> 01:34:32,275
This house.

1696
01:34:33,945 --> 01:34:36,049
Well, until I sell
it, do you wanna split

1697
01:34:36,133 --> 01:34:38,156
whatever comes in from the rental thing?

1698
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,315
Okay.

1699
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:40,937
Every little bit helps.

1700
01:34:41,021 --> 01:34:44,435
Dan, you must get a real estate agent.

1701
01:34:44,519 --> 01:34:46,079
I told you, I'm not doing that.

1702
01:34:54,443 --> 01:34:55,443
Hi.

1703
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:57,333
Got a sec?

1704
01:34:58,214 --> 01:34:59,159
We were just leaving.

1705
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:01,128
Well, flight's not till four.

1706
01:35:01,212 --> 01:35:02,712
Got a few minutes.

1707
01:35:05,173 --> 01:35:06,553
This is Runa.

1708
01:35:06,637 --> 01:35:07,857
Ah.

1709
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:09,142
Should've interviewed me.

1710
01:35:09,226 --> 01:35:10,636
I know all her secrets.

1711
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:11,720
I'm Dan.

1712
01:35:12,636 --> 01:35:14,591
Would you put the bags in the car?

1713
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:18,592
And I'm gonna go put
the bags in the car now.

1714
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:24,696
Give me a hand?

1715
01:35:27,149 --> 01:35:28,970
Thank you for sending your articles.

1716
01:35:29,054 --> 01:35:30,936
I'm sorry I was so paranoid.

1717
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:32,516
You're a good writer.

1718
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,807
Can't imagine what you're
gonna write about me.

1719
01:35:37,105 --> 01:35:39,272
We need to take this down.

1720
01:35:52,129 --> 01:35:54,230
Well, look at you.

1721
01:35:54,314 --> 01:35:55,064
That was really beautiful

1722
01:35:55,148 --> 01:35:56,971
what you did for your friends.

1723
01:35:57,055 --> 01:35:58,638
Where did you learn to do that?

1724
01:35:58,722 --> 01:36:00,672
When I stopped
competing in gymnastics.

1725
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:02,530
A gym rat.

1726
01:36:02,614 --> 01:36:05,231
My mom was on the East
German team back in the day.

1727
01:36:05,315 --> 01:36:09,835
She wanted a child she
could raise the same way.

1728
01:36:09,919 --> 01:36:11,061
She looked and looked to find someone

1729
01:36:11,145 --> 01:36:13,395
who'd be the perfect match.

1730
01:36:14,713 --> 01:36:17,947
Didn't get the hair color, but otherwise,

1731
01:36:18,031 --> 01:36:19,242
she got what she wanted.

1732
01:36:19,326 --> 01:36:20,409
Lucky girl.

1733
01:36:24,494 --> 01:36:25,835
She's passed on, now.

1734
01:36:25,919 --> 01:36:26,887
Oh.

1735
01:36:26,971 --> 01:36:28,119
Same thing
that made her infertile

1736
01:36:28,203 --> 01:36:30,186
eventually came back.

1737
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:31,245
I'm sorry.

1738
01:36:31,329 --> 01:36:34,098
Took a me awhile before
I decided to go looking.

1739
01:36:34,182 --> 01:36:37,198
And then when I did, I realized
no one was looking for me,

1740
01:36:37,282 --> 01:36:38,927
which made it tougher.

1741
01:36:39,011 --> 01:36:41,344
But I'm good at researching.

1742
01:36:42,702 --> 01:36:44,773
I know you are.

1743
01:36:44,857 --> 01:36:48,310
I always knew there
was a mystery between us,

1744
01:36:48,394 --> 01:36:52,314
our differences and
why she called me Runa.

1745
01:36:52,398 --> 01:36:53,992
There was a hidden story there,

1746
01:36:54,076 --> 01:36:57,743
which is probably why
I got into journalism.

1747
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,012
So I kept looking.

1748
01:37:01,096 --> 01:37:03,789
When you say looking...

1749
01:37:03,873 --> 01:37:05,264
For the perfect match.

1750
01:37:07,994 --> 01:37:11,144
I'm really sorry, I have to go.

1751
01:37:20,033 --> 01:37:21,783
It was back in '88,

1752
01:37:23,927 --> 01:37:28,677
though they didn't end up
doing it for another few years.

1753
01:37:30,341 --> 01:37:33,758
They tried and tried, and then it worked.

1754
01:37:38,474 --> 01:37:39,807
And they got me.

1755
01:37:46,435 --> 01:37:47,435
From you.

1756
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,231
I didn't know if you wanted to know.

1757
01:37:52,315 --> 01:37:53,819
I had to be certain.

1758
01:37:53,903 --> 01:37:55,858
I already had a great mom
and I didn't wanna ruin it,

1759
01:37:55,942 --> 01:37:58,192
if somebody didn't want me.

1760
01:38:00,373 --> 01:38:01,706
I checked your DNA to be certain.

1761
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,138
I stole your Band-Aid.

1762
01:38:03,222 --> 01:38:04,222
Sorry.

1763
01:38:10,749 --> 01:38:13,363
My arm has to heal so that
I can hold you properly.

1764
01:38:13,447 --> 01:38:14,861
It will.

1765
01:38:14,945 --> 01:38:16,669
Injury, not age, right?

1766
01:38:16,753 --> 01:38:19,420
Yeah

1767
01:38:21,259 --> 01:38:23,092
What does Runa mean?

1768
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:25,816
It means secret.

1769
01:38:33,102 --> 01:38:36,102
Now I have some questions for you.

1770
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,917
Wait a minute, I can't leave.

1771
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:51,751
You have to go.

1772
01:38:51,835 --> 01:38:53,001
No way. Dan?

1773
01:38:57,292 --> 01:38:59,066
- Dan.
- You rang?

1774
01:38:59,150 --> 01:38:59,899
Wait, I need my phone.

1775
01:38:59,983 --> 01:39:00,733
- Where's my purse?
- Wait a minute.

1776
01:39:00,817 --> 01:39:03,899
- You can't do this.
- What, yes, I can.

1777
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,494
- Your bags in the car.
- Give me your phone.

1778
01:39:07,578 --> 01:39:08,328
- No, no.
- Okay.

1779
01:39:08,412 --> 01:39:12,661
- It's gonna be fine.
- Look, what's happening here?

1780
01:39:14,797 --> 01:39:16,011
This is my daughter.

1781
01:39:16,095 --> 01:39:17,101
Say hello.

1782
01:39:17,185 --> 01:39:18,126
Wait a minute. What?

1783
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:19,629
Yes, and I'm coming off the road

1784
01:39:19,713 --> 01:39:23,713
and I'm staying at the
house and I need a phone.

1785
01:39:25,737 --> 01:39:26,963
No, this tour's gonna start

1786
01:39:27,047 --> 01:39:28,298
- a whole new career for you.
- I don't care.

1787
01:39:28,382 --> 01:39:30,069
- I do.
- I'm not leaving you.

1788
01:39:30,153 --> 01:39:30,970
It's okay.

1789
01:39:31,054 --> 01:39:33,970
This is the story I wanted to tell.

1790
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:41,324
Since I just became an
honorary uncle here, I vote stay.

1791
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:42,530
- Yes.
