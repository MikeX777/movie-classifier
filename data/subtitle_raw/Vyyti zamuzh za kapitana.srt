1
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
Comrade

2
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,720
- Elena Pavlovna, please. - Yes...

3
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,200
-Says Captain Pancakes. I brought you a package.

4
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,630
-When is it convenient to deliver it?

5
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,336
-When you want, you can now.

6
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,040
-Better now, I’m on my way on vacation.

7
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,550
-Come, I'm waiting.

8
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
-Good.

9
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,950
-Who do you have?

10
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,700
-Elena Pavlovna Zhuravleva.

11
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,520
- And she left. - How? - Gone.

12
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,700
- I just spoke to her on the phone, she promised ...

13
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,910
-Hee. She promised ... She promised and left.

14
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,290
- She promised to pay for the light, and did not pay.

15
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,606
- Good. “Can I leave this package for her?”

16
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,736
-Not. I do not know what is in this package.

17
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,750
And I do not take responsibility.

18
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,910
- Here are the books. - Not.

19
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,640
-Listen ...

20
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,810
And you call. Maybe she will promise you something else.

21
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,120
The station.

22
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,760
-Shur, do you want carrots?

23
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,890
Then I’ll eat it myself.

24
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,890
- Well, you have teeth, mother.

25
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,850
- Well, I’m doing my own, natural. And you two are missing.

26
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,320
- Such water in the mountains, mother.

27
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,610
-Water ... You are your family matter,

28
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,430
do you think ever allow in the near future?

29
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,016
- Yes, I should. And the authorities recommend.

30
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,520
- Do you even have a girlfriend?

31
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,000
Huh?

32
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,300
We have one on the farm. She earns experience.

33
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,570
- He wants to do. -Where? - To the institute, where.

34
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,350
-Well mother, come on a verbal portrait.

35
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,556
-Yes no portrait.

36
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,070
-Well describe her, what she is, so that he can find out on the street there in the library.

37
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,976
-Cute!

38
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,856
-Well, they are all pretty, while young. Exact parameters?

39
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,136
- What? - Growth.

40
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,270
- And like this. - So 1.72 m. Breast size?

41
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,110
- Well, how can that be about a girl?

42
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,860
-Well, wait mother. If there is a girl, she has breasts.

43
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,496
If there is a breast, it is a certain size. How do I recognize a girl then?

44
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,916
- In! -Not exactly. Well, and special signs? - Little black one.

45
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,636
-Today is black, tomorrow is red-haired, not ...

46
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,960
-But it's not in your city. We have everything natural!

47
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,996
- But there are special signs. There is. - Well ka?

48
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,386
- She has a scar above her left brow. - A scar?

49
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,910
-When she was small, she fell off the porch.

50
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,910
-Hmmm ... what are you mother ...

51
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,206
- Do you palm off on me nuts? - Well, what are you, what are you?

52
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,406
- Well, just fell off - it means hit, and not with anything, but with the head.

53
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,546
- You say yourself, there is a scar. - Well ...

54
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,230
-And when a person hits his head, the consequences can affect after many years, mother.

55
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,320
- Shura ... - Ah ...

56
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,870
-A fool you are Shura, not a commander!

57
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,960
Oh mother, mother ...

58
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
- Mother? - AND...

59
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,170
- Where are you? - Yes, here I am.

60
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,900
- What are you doing? - I'm watching TV. - Yeah.

61
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,300
What if I ...

62
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,280
will I go for a walk?

63
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,960
- Go for a walk. - So.

64
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,170
Where is my white t-shirt?

65
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,720
Sorry uncle.

66
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,280
Song: "Rejoice at the people around, Do not rush to judge them.

67
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,920
If a friend called you - hurry to help.

68
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,160
Will you meet many good friends in your life

69
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,900
Good and honest friends. Goodbye!"

70
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,396
-Health Sanya. Came on vacation, home?

71
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,676
Hello to mom. Do not forget mother, you come in!

72
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
- OK Bye. - Be healthy!

73
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,830
Hello.

74
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,400
Hello.

75
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,476
- Hello, Elena Pavlovna, please. - Yes...

76
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,196
-Says Captain Blinov, I have an assignment for you.

77
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,660
-And where did you go then?

78
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,096
- I was told that you are not at home!

79
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,096
I could not wait, the train was leaving me.

80
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,526
Now I am 54 kilometers from the city, the village of Krutoe.

81
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,290
When is it convenient for you to bring the package?

82
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,750
- Can you come now?

83
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,920
-Well, that's right.

84
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,556
Hello, I’m to Zhuravleva Elena Pavlovna ...

85
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,280
There is no such!

86
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,960
- Well, how is it not? This is me, hello. - Hello.

87
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,920
“Comrade, why are you misinforming?” - Listen, you know what ...

88
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,040
such people should not be on earth.

89
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,450
- Such as you should not be on earth. - Shut up!

90
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,150
- Yeah of course. - What are you doing?

91
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,230
-Allow comrade. Allow, allow.

92
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,670
-Well, what have you done?

93
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,410
- Everything is washed here ... Hooligan. - Come on in.

94
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,329
Do you have a tense relationship with a neighbor?

95
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,353
We have a war here!

96
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,600
- Come on in. - Thank.

97
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,580
-Sit down. You want to put it there.

98
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,480
Let's have breakfast. I had breakfast.

99
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
- No, no thanks. “Why, you are off the road.”

100
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,790
- How is my girlfriend? - Good.

101
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,260
- And how is her wonderful husband? “Ah ... already major.”

102
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,640
- Yeah. You don’t have a cup now.

103
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,960
-And why does a friend think that you should not be on earth?

104
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,280
-Because I smoke.

105
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,170
Because I listen to music that he doesn't like.

106
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,040
Thirdly, I am divorced.

107
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,760
And most importantly, he considers me a parasite.

108
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,680
When I explain to him that I am the face of a free profession ...

109
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
-Enough.

110
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,240
-He giggles disgustingly, apparently confused with the most ancient professions.

111
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,460
- And what ... - I have a profession?

112
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,210
I am a photojournalist. True, contingent.

113
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,136
But I can show help.

114
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,686
- No, I believe you, what do you ... - No, I can, why not?

115
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,830
I have it.

116
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,040
Please, here.

117
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
- Zhuravlyova ...

118
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,720
-Elena Pavlovna, artist-photographer, -Yeah, it's me.

119
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,850
Freelance correspondent, annual income of 600 rubles.

120
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,710
- So what? -Not much. “But what is it to him?”

121
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,100
The main thing is help. Yes? I then earn some more.

122
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,180
So now, I'm in a hurry to work.

123
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm in a hurry to work.

124
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,970
No, you are sitting, sitting calmly.

125
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,710
But have you seen this?

126
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,840
- He tweaks. - How?

127
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,170
-Like this. And so it sneaks up, like it tweaks.

128
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,700
- Ah ... What are you? - What about me? What can I do?

129
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,980
What can I do? He's big and strong.

130
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,690
Very brutal. He used to be a great boss,

131
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,240
and then they shoved him into retirement.

132
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,440
And the wife left him, along with the apartment.

133
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,780
I complained to the police, but they do not believe me.

134
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,250
They don’t believe me. Spoken: Such a person cannot pinch.

135
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,000
“But he is pinching it!” - OK OK. - Yeah.

136
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,330
-Clear.

137
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,960
-And what documents do you have?

138
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,470
-I have? ID cards, here.

139
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,940
-The State Security Committee ... What you need!

140
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,980
- And what ... Why? “I need help.” -I AM...

141
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,980
don't understand now?

142
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,116
-You don't need to understand anything. Just...

143
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,180
you need to protect me if he tries to hit me.

144
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,760
- Will you hit? - Yeah.

145
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,120
- Well, in that case, you can count on my help.

146
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,810
- Then let's go? - Where? -There.

147
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,590
-AND?

148
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,536
-Go ... What is this?

149
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,410
- Elena Pavlovna, what are you doing? “It hurts, what are you doing?”

150
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,830
- Let go, let go! - Elena Pavlovna, what are you doing?

151
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,656
-I demand! What's this? Together for one?

152
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,510
-Stop it! What are you doing, calm down in the end, calm down comrade.

153
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,950
- Calm down! - I've calmed down.

154
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,456
-Sorry, I didn’t assume that everything would turn out like that.

155
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,180
-Now you will see how all this will turn out for you!

156
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,486
Now you will see, now you will see!

157
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,260
- Listen, comrade ... - Now you will see ...

158
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,680
Police ... Assault in the apartment ...

159
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,920
Yes! Robbery attack with self-mutilation.

160
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,870
Yes! Izverskaya 8, apartment 25. Urgent, urgent, let's get here!

161
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,470
-Well, how is our neighbor?

162
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,976
- You put me in a difficult position, Elena Pavlovna!

163
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,640
-And nobody will believe him anyway!

164
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,320
So that you, a border guard officer, take part in an apartment brawl? Yes, never.

165
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,380
-He blocked the exit.

166
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,280
-So now, the police will come.

167
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,230
Something I lost. I'm so forgetful.

168
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,950
Ah ... a tripod.

169
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,930
- ABOUT! Already! - I wish you good health ...

170
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,390
What do you have?

171
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,920
- You have to pay for pleasure! - Elena Pavlovna ...

172
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,040
-Let's go there, my captain.

173
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,410
-Here they are!

174
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,520
-So, you are in your room, and you are in yours!

175
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,510
- Allow ... - Follow the order!

176
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,130
“Lieutenant, you and I are in the kitchen!” - Wait a minute ...

177
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,710
-Yes. I will ask the tenants into the corridor!

178
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,720
It’s a pity, Kondraty Petrovich, that I was mistaken in you.

179
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,550
“Who did you believe?” - We will naturally check ...

180
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,320
But I have no reason not to trust Captain Blinov.

181
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,016
-This is to which captain?

182
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,040
-Capitan border guard, Blinov Alexander Petrovich.

183
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,040
-Sorry, I didn’t have time to introduce myself to you, somehow everything was quick somehow.

184
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,240
-You can of course write a statement to your neighbor next,

185
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,016
but if a medical examination confirms that you have plucked it,

186
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,370
we will prosecute you.

187
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,370
- Clear? - Will write!

188
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,140
-Write. I have the honor!

189
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,080
“Have a good rest, Comrade Captain!” - Thank you lieutenant, all the best!

190
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,180
-We will consider the incident settled, comrade?

191
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,900
- Goodbye. - What did you say to the policeman?

192
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,380
- Really. I said that the situation was unclear, but I defended your honor.

193
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,730
- For the first time in my life they defend my honor, by the way, I always defend myself.

194
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,390
-I called the situation unclear, just because I myself don’t like arrogance and optionality,

195
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,680
and these elements in your behavior apparently took place.

196
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,276
- Oh, you are? - Yes, such! Goodbye! - Yeah, yeah.

197
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,390
Wait!

198
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,016
But I got excited.

199
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
-Yes Elena Pavlovna, you got excited!

200
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,140
- Here you go, and he will start again.

201
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,470
He’ll come up with something to leave no traces.

202
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,630
- Let me put you on a tape recorder? - Not understood?

203
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,610
- I will turn it on so that he thinks that you live with me.

204
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,856
I will include it during the day - as you say, and at night - how to snore.

205
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,670
-Listen, I do not snore.

206
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,940
-No, listen, but you have to help me!

207
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,046
No, well, I don’t have to ...

208
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,456
I'm just begging you! You must understand me.

209
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
- I ask. - Elena Pavlovna, I ...

210
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,000
-Maybe let's do that?

211
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,376
I will ask you questions, you will answer them.

212
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,230
Only loudly. So he thinks that we have ...

213
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,980
Long-standing and possibly intimate relationships.

214
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,016
-What actually may be questions?

215
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,956
- The most different and possibly pleasant.

216
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,116
Only you do not say monotonous: Yes, That,

217
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,570
Use all your vocabulary.

218
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,980
- Well ... - Good.

219
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,980
-Let's start?

220
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,050
Sasha, will you help me bring the equipment?

221
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,540
-Yes. Yes!

222
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,060
- She's so heavy.

223
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,340
-Sasha, are you leaving soon to guard the border?

224
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,640
-Naturally!

225
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,680
-Sasha, will you often write to me?

226
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,000
-Well ... Of course!

227
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,000
-And I will write to you every day!

228
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,870
Do you want to know how we are doing here?

229
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,900
- With Kondraty Petrovich! - And how!

230
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,380
-Kiss me on the track.

231
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,160
-Do you want to kiss me on the track?

232
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,550
-By itself!

233
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,140
- Hurry up, honey? - By all means!

234
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,240
- I hope you correctly understood this kiss? - Yes, I understood correctly.

235
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,480
-Maybe he peeps, and one sound would not be enough.

236
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,880
- I needed a picture. - It was witty.

237
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,866
-And you carry all this on yourself every day?

238
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,900
- The costs of equality, then no one will drag me.

239
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,230
- Do you like a profession? - I am doing this business out of principle.

240
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,810
-I.e?

241
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,976
-At the 3rd year of university, I jumped out to marry a fool.

242
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,240
He considered himself a brilliant photo artist.

243
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,590
I asked for school, washed for him, cooked.

244
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,990
Later...

245
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,200
She began to earn money on trifles, there was nothing to eat.

246
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,060
And he is a lazy person and mediocrity, I could not stand it, filed for divorce.

247
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,780
Fundamentally sued him half of the equipment.

248
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,760
After all, we bought it with my money.

249
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,546
And in vain began to take pictures.

250
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,976
His photos for our entire mating season have been published 3 times.

251
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,126
And I publish regularly, almost regularly.

252
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,400
So we have come.

253
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Comrade Captain ... Let's go.

254
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,570
Sit here, I am now.

255
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,620
-M ... Hello.

256
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,760
- At last. - I'm ready.

257
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
-Look?

258
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,840
-Who?

259
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,640
- Did the fashion model forget?

260
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,640
- I didn’t get through to him.

261
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
- You're lying.

262
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,630
-But you don’t think so, I found it better.

263
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,650
-Where?

264
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,140
- Where? -There! - Yeah. - There.

265
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,670
Well let's go.

266
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,770
- Meet me please.

267
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,880
Blinov Alexander Petrovich.

268
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,670
-Very nice.

269
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,240
-Original?

270
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Okay...

271
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,370
Wait.

272
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,776
-Maybe for a moment. You know, this girl needs help.

273
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,306
She alone is simply embarrassed to be photographed, and her partner got sick.

274
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,800
- Who got sick? -Partner. - Lena ... Come.

275
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,780
Karinochka, then you stretch him a tie and smile.

276
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,800
No, better put a hand on his shoulder.

277
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,830
Like this. Good. Now you. What team do you support?

278
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,916
- I AM? -Yes. - For Kiev Dynamo.

279
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,190
- So you smile as if your favorite team won.

280
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,556
Lena, so we will shoot.

281
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,920
-One second girl.

282
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,856
What's happening?

283
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,256
-Advertising ties. Karina, a hand on his shoulder.

284
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,440
-Don't, girl.

285
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,156
-Elena Pavlovna ... What's the matter? What's happening?

286
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,510
-And what? It is only 2 minutes.

287
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,150
-I will not advertise ties, I am an officer!

288
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,010
-So what?

289
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,690
-I don’t think that a border guard officer should replicate his image.

290
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,030
-Yes Yes Yes. Your image is very necessary for the enemies!

291
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,500
-I'm sorry, Pavlovna, this time I can’t help. Goodbye.

292
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,400
-Elena! If you think that I will endure your antics endlessly,

293
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,370
if you think that I will not find this place

294
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,680
more grateful and disciplined photographer ...

295
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
-Well what a knight? Deprived a woman of a piece of bread.

296
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,150
I lost a quarter, understand? A good place.

297
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,280
- On. - Oh, thank you.

298
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,110
I thought I won’t take it? Look, what is right, what is noble.

299
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,890
-What do you need, Grandma?

300
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,016
You, smoking women and a non-smoking man.

301
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,020
- You certainly are not smokers? - No, not a smoker.

302
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,030
- In Paris, nobody cares. “Have you been to Paris?”

303
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,896
-Never mind.

304
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,800
-If you speak objectively, then you yourself poorly organized this photography.

305
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Personally you.

306
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,306
-Lena, I will help you, wait.

307
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,496
-Rest on vacation!

308
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,946
- Wait Lena, well, wait, I can’t ... - Oh yes, you are right with us!

309
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,490
- Let's. - Well then, hold on.

310
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,810
- And so where? -There. - There?

311
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,120
“Well, captain?”

312
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,660
- Is our army the most enduring in the world? - Of course.

313
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,330
- And this is where we arrived? - This is television.

314
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,000
- Do you work here?

315
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,110
- For now, yes. - Clear.

316
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,200
- Elena? - Now.

317
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,970
- Hello. - Hello.

318
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,920
- Who are you with? - Yes, he brought the equipment.

319
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,886
- Selected photos? - Yes master, everything was done by the master!

320
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,140
-Well clever.

321
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,171
I can’t help with the cottage, once. Until the evening?

322
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,195
It's a pity. Yeah.

323
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,170
- A colleague? - This is Lyadov.

324
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,960
Was recently abroad from central television.

325
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,100
-Lazarev. Most likely in Bengaba.

326
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,100
-Yes, how do you know?

327
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,700
- Hello. - Salute.

328
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,326
-Hi. Listen, come to me. There is work. So here it is.

329
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,350
-Good.

330
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,230
- Hi Elena! - Hello.

331
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,050
-Healthy.

332
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,510
Are you crazy or a fagot?

333
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,150
“Is that idiot yours?” - Mine, assistant.

334
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,910
- We must warn you.

335
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,260
-Sorry, I won’t be, but you don’t beat me anymore either.

336
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,980
- Okay? -Okay. - Thank.

337
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,466
-Well done! You defended my honor for the second time.

338
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,610
Only this man came in, sometimes tossed me a job.

339
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,810
-How much?

340
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,920
-Don't bring me up! I'll take the second quarter.

341
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,656
- Hello Seryozha. - Oh, hi.

342
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,040
“You don't have anyone with a car?” “Why only me?”

343
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,500
-Oh, hi!

344
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,140
-Well, tell me how you rested?

345
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,400
-Alexander Petrovich.

346
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,320
-Let's go.

347
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,100
- What are they here, all the relatives or what? - Why?

348
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,590
-Everybody kisses.

349
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,850
- Helen, who is it? - My assistant.

350
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,630
-Where next?

351
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,130
-Mouse.

352
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,370
- I would have a cabin, for about 20 minutes. - Do not ask for urgent development.

353
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,330
-Unload.

354
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,510
- I'll write to your superiors ...

355
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,270
To you, awarded an extraordinary vacation.

356
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,496
-Officers, extraordinary leave is not allowed.

357
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
-Clear.

358
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,100
- What is clear? “Everything is clear with you.”

359
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,030
- Edik, are you here? - Yes. In half an hour, not earlier.

360
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,470
-Then sit down.

361
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,620
- No, let's go get some coffee.

362
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,050
- Hello, are you on wheels today? “Not today, Helen.”

363
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,220
- Salute Polina. - Hi. - Can I go to you?

364
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,166
- Meet me now. - Alexander Petrovich.

365
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,270
- Why Petrovich? A techie or something? - Not understood?

366
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,946
- Of the engineers? “No, officer.”

367
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,130
“How did you not guess?” It’s written on you! - Yes?

368
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,380
-The current man by the age of 30 is already loose, and the warriors are in uniform.

369
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,516
- Are you a correspondent here too?

370
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,010
-Not. I am a translator from French, and here I work in an agricultural editorial office.

371
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,070
-In the agricultural editorial office?

372
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,816
-And today I got rich, help yourself!

373
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,996
Are you versed in agriculture?

374
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,390
In agriculture, in general, everyone understands.

375
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,960
- Earned 25 durik fish. - Tell me how?

376
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,936
- I will not say. - A military secret.

377
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
- May I take to my office? - Yeah.

378
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,390
“Polina, do you have any acquaintance with the car?” “You know what is not, that is not.”

379
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,300
- It's a pity. “Have you forgotten about the evening?” - Yeah.

380
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,110
-Goodbye.

381
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,260
“Do you have any problems?” - Yeah.

382
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,300
- You need to transfer maman with suitcases to the cottage.

383
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,140
But these are complex problems.

384
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,156
-Transport, plus male power.

385
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,140
- Well, male power is available, you can take a taxi.

386
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,360
-Maman does not like to spend money on taxis.

387
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,880
- However, today I am rich. - That's it.

388
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,416
- And here is our academic yard. - Academic?

389
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,330
Yes, I’m a professor’s daughter.

390
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,200
- And this is us. - Finally.

391
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,300
-I'm almost ready, but you're still gone.

392
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,920
-Elena, let's make up the flowers, cover the furniture.

393
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,680
- Mom, Vera Semyonovna. - Alexander Petrovich.

394
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,290
“Is he with us?” - With us.

395
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,146
-Sasha, please, get 2 suitcases from the mezzanine: Brown and black.

396
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,576
- Ma, it’s not so right away.

397
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,256
-Well, we are in a hurry.

398
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,356
- With pleasure, I will help you. Vera Semyonovna, Lena said that ...

399
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,000
You have a car, you give me the keys, I'll see if it starts up somehow.

400
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,930
- She certainly won't start ...

401
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,400
But still you look.

402
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,716
And then they will tell me: -Change the wheels. I change wheels.

403
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,570
They say to me: -Change the motor. I am changing the motor.

404
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,550
- Here are the keys. Garage in the yard.

405
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,280
- The first boxing. - Good.

406
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,100
-Sasha!

407
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,246
-Well, did our car go?

408
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,990
-Go, go, only the muffler fell off.

409
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,520
-Elena, our “Victory” went.

410
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,800
- Helen. We drive in our car.

411
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,430
To his dacha.

412
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,370
How happy your father, Leonid Aleksandrovich, would have lived.

413
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,880
You know Sasha, my husbands were ...

414
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,140
Scientific adversaries. And you would reconcile them.

415
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,370
I buried them nearby, it’s easier to care for the graves.

416
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,100
-Sasha. Or maybe we’ll visit them now?

417
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,720
“Better another time, mother.”

418
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,290
- Please, in our penates.

419
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,510
Here we have a little bit running.

420
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,240
Sasha, bring things here!

421
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,620
But first, let's eat.

422
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,360
I scored all kinds of food.

423
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,510
Elena, products in a blue bag.

424
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,820
Sasha, help me melt a samovar, okay?

425
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,820
- You are welcome. - Come with me.

426
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,440
Here we have water.

427
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,570
- No water. - No water? -Elena!

428
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,706
-No water. How many times have I told her: -I must come check.

429
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,480
- Do you have any instrument? - There is. -Not!

430
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,760
-Is there. Lena, where?

431
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,170
- Put the suitcase over there. And take out the dishes.

432
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,080
And collect all the covers.

433
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
-Hooray.

434
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,630
- And he's nothing kid. - Nothing, nothing.

435
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,740
- Now they are called - No problem.

436
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,620
All my life I dreamed about this.

437
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,660
-As far as I know, you always dreamed about the opposite.

438
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,480
Everyone knows who the woman is marrying

439
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,650
and about whom she dreams, she knows only.

440
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,210
-This is something new.

441
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,650
-If I got married a third time,

442
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,730
I would marry ... a real man.

443
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,390
There are a lot of things in pundits

444
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,270
undemanding, intelligent, earns a lot, but ...

445
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,320
to ...

446
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,630
- Repair the gates, it is not necessary to marry a carpenter.

447
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,480
-Fool you, I'm not talking about that.

448
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,300
-And you saw how he picked up our suitcases when we trudged with you to the car?

449
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,120
So you asked your Lyadov to help, but where is he?

450
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,080
But real men come to the rescue without any call themselves.

451
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,560
- Who is he? Of the engineers? “He is one of the officers.”

452
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,560
Border guard.

453
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,600
-I am not very familiar with this area.

454
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,880
But you know, I heard that it requires personal data.

455
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,130
-And you know Sasha,

456
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,650
we have a ridiculously progressive family.

457
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,210
My grandfather was a political prisoner.

458
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,480
In relatives of my second husband, there were a lot of Decembrists.

459
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,840
And Lenka, she was born on May 1.

460
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,770
-You would at least take a little walk here, breathe.

461
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,110
-No mother, once. I’m in 3 more places.

462
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,120
-Sorry, last event.

463
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,590
- What? -It seems an anniversary. - Allow me!

464
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,180
-Only request: There are no knightly things.

465
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,740
- The young man is here!

466
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,660
-There are 3 people here, first we pay.

467
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,790
-And what are your tasks here?

468
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,250
-Elena takes pictures,

469
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,700
and after a banquet, I will translate a new video in a close circle, foreign.

470
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,080
Yes, eat, you are an assistant. And this is a service table.

471
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,670
Yes, they will figure it out without you.

472
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,970
-Arrived.

473
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,980
- Maybe you’ll stop by for tea?

474
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,410
-Now 0:37, probably not convenient.

475
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,590
- It’s always convenient for me.

476
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,456
-If you allow me, I will come to you next time.

477
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,790
-Well, of course.

478
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,420
-And let me ... raise the equipment?

479
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,120
-Well, of course.

480
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,690
- Captain, where will you spend the night?

481
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,040
-I don’t know, I’ll come up with something.

482
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,370
- And you spend the night with me. - Like this? -So.

483
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,050
-This is even necessary. Let Kondratius think

484
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,356
that I live under the vigilant guard of the border troops.

485
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Let's go.

486
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,660
- Honey, hurry up!

487
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,970
- I'll bed on the couch, and I’ll lie down behind the screen.

488
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,840
I will disappear early, you are the boss here.

489
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,740
I have an exit task.

490
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,480
And you will slam the door.

491
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,800
Go freshen up.

492
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
-I beg.

493
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,120
-Comrade captain ...

494
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,670
Since you are serious about Elena,

495
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,670
must warn you!

496
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,200
That while you are guarding the border, men go to it.

497
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,520
I'll pinch you now!

498
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,730
Lena, are you far off tomorrow?

499
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,970
-There are more than a hundred kilometers.

500
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,896
And most importantly - on the chaise.

501
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,360
First to Antievka, and then to collective farms.

502
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,680
-Clear.

503
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,050
-Elena Pavlovna ... you are on the phone.

504
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,180
Male voice.

505
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
-Yes?

506
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,020
I remember that we agreed.

507
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,040
I am very tired and there were different circumstances.

508
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,830
But you call and appear only when it is convenient for you.

509
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,390
Yeah.

510
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,130
As you want. Good night.

511
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
-Lena.

512
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,230
Can I still leave?

513
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,360
- No, you are. In no case.

514
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,400
-Well, you need to go home! Your mother will be worried!

515
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,010
-Call you!

516
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,160
- And the car is old. - What?

517
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,670
- The car is old. - Nothing, fix it!

518
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,320
- But I do not know. - Sit down!

519
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,040
-Sit down, sit down! Now we will wake up the whole district.

520
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,280
-What is the purpose of our business trip?

521
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,546
- We need to take a photo essay. - So.

522
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,980
-Well, 20-30 photos.

523
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,740
-The rubric they have is - "Business trip by letter."

524
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,180
“Is the letter calling on the road?” - That's it!

525
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,106
The essence of the matter is: Today, a rich harvest of apples?

526
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,130
So.

527
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,031
Saw in the market.

528
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:32,680
Well in the market - yes. Dried fruits are in the store.

529
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,460
- What? - I do not know.

530
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,460
-Because apples are not taken out, they spoil, they are fed to pigs.

531
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,200
-Why not exported?

532
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,960
-I do not know. But this is not order!

533
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,380
- Here on these disorders, we will hit. - I see.

534
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,736
-And often do you have like this?

535
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,930
-Listen, come on "You."

536
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,100
- Personally, I say “you,” only to people over 70.

537
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,960
- Well, let's try. - Yeah.

538
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,870
-You know Lena, you can swim here.

539
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,410
-And I don’t have a swimsuit.

540
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,386
-And we will divide the zones.

541
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,340
You are on the right side, and I am here, here.

542
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,000
- Good. - Come on.

543
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,700
-Me brings to you.

544
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,266
- Lena, it's shallow here. You stand up. - It carries me to you.

545
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,150
- Stand up, stand up, shallow.

546
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,320
- Guilty.

547
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,430
- I can’t do it against the tide.

548
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,310
- Well then ... You need to learn.

549
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,826
-Sweet suffering came to the gardens of our area.

550
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,546
If you spoil apples, do not worry.

551
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:00,146
Homemade apples on jam, tasty and nutritious foods.

552
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,866
Having previously cleared the fruits, touched by decay,

553
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,200
cut them into slices, and boil in boiling water for 10-20 minutes.

554
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,490
2 glasses of water, per 3 kilograms of fruit.

555
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,680
-We will be like everyone else.

556
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,460
“They pay attention to you.” - Yes? - Yeah.

557
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,120
- Not ... It's on you. - What are our plans?

558
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,480
-See local attractions and the unofficial part.

559
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,540
-Received!

560
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,540
- Take the flowers. - I take it. - Take it. -These ones.

561
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,340
-And maybe this one? This one is prettier.

562
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,310
- I like all the same. - Thank you.

563
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,610
- Thank. - To health.

564
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,660
“Captain, some people really like you.” - Thank.

565
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,540
Why don't you ask who?

566
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,140
To my mom.

567
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,710
“Why don't you ask how I feel about you?”

568
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,590
- In my opinion, they don’t ask about it.

569
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,530
-Then I’ll say it myself: I’m calm with you.

570
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,420
Only 2 days have passed, and I ask myself

571
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,740
how will I do without you.

572
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,140
- Are you afraid it? - Not.

573
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:31,000
-Sasha, do you have any principle? Fundamental or what?

574
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,160
Based on which you live.

575
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,220
A friend of mine, for example, has this:

576
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:40,360
-Don't rush to this tram, because the next one will come.

577
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,840
-And you have?

578
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,400
-You know, with my father,

579
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,086
there was a soldier’s mug, even from my grandfather.

580
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:53,470
There is an inscription on it: "Honestly serve - do not bother about anything."

581
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,670
-Well is it for military service?

582
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,670
-Well immediately: Army, army?

583
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,750
-Can...

584
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,940
serve a woman, friends ... business.

585
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,350
-I want to dance.

586
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,160
-Here, in my opinion ... they don’t dance.

587
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,650
- Ladies invite gentlemen.

588
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,180
- Yes? - White dance!

589
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,030
-Well, they invite ...

590
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,670
- And you dance well. - Thank.

591
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,740
- In general, everything you have done so far, you did not do so badly.

592
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,160
- Thank you! “I have to drink with you at the Brudershaft.”

593
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,960
- Here? - Only soft drinks. - Never mind.

594
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,020
-Tell me, do you want to shock those present?

595
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,190
-And what if I just want to kiss you?

596
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,450
Not for a neighbor, I'm for myself.

597
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:10,406
“Order something else?” “Of course I want apples.”

598
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,800
- Apple? - Yeah.

599
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,600
- There are so many dried fruit compotes. - Here.

600
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,870
“Life doesn't fit your rules, captain.”

601
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,080
-Well nothing. As our major says:

602
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,270
"Wait and see".

603
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:02,190
- Lena? -Yes. - Climb!

604
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,060
-Now 7:50, at 8:15 I am waiting for you downstairs in the buffet.

605
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
-What should you take?

606
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,160
-Cold veal, Roquefort cheese, orange juice and hot chocolate.

607
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:15,500
- I see, it means like this: Fried eggs and sour cream.

608
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,030
-Come on, I'm waiting for you downstairs!

609
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,230
-Good morning.

610
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,140
-Good.

611
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,330
- I ask you to! - Yeah. - What is the action plan?

612
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,200
- Do not know yet. - What needs to be removed?

613
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,960
-Well, let's say: Canning factory, where there is a line for the machine.

614
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:56,720
- Yeah.

615
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,340
-Warehouse where everything is littered with apples, they rot.

616
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,240
- Well, first you need to come to the authorities and introduce yourself.

617
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,430
-ABOUT. That's right!

618
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,180
-But no one wants to make quarrels out of the hut.

619
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,810
They will immediately give a command, and no one will let me go.

620
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,700
- But why? - They won’t let it go like that.

621
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,940
-Warehouse will be closed, storekeepers hurt,

622
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,160
and the pigs will roar with hunger in their pigsties.

623
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,200
-What is the plan of action?

624
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,200
-No one!

625
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,450
-So this way:

626
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,450
Each operation requires preparation, first of all - this is information.

627
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,560
If we don’t get it from the authorities,

628
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,450
we will get it from interested parties. I.e...

629
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,150
From the people.

630
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,080
- And what is it? - I bought a card.

631
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,320
- Terrain. - Yeah.

632
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,960
“Where did you spend the night?” - I AM?

633
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,800
In a good place.

634
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,350
-Well, how?

635
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,890
- Wonderful. Keep it washed. - Thank.

636
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,160
- So, the object that interests us the most is the Pobeda collective farm,

637
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,016
falling gardens, pigsties, everything is compactly located.

638
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,216
- How much time do you need? - Minutes 15-20.

639
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,036
- Pure time? - Pure time.

640
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,520
- Until they reach the board, 15 minutes will pass.

641
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,400
While they find the chairman or someone from the authorities, another good half an hour.

642
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,090
- Unless of course the chairman has a walkie-talkie. - Take a chance?

643
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,960
- Take a chance! - Map?

644
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,670
-Here. Here, here!

645
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,910
So.

646
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,620
- Object number 1: Gardens.

647
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,520
For the entire operation I give 3 minutes.

648
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,290
- Object number 2: Livestock complex.

649
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,920
- Get ready!

650
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,120
- Why are you shooting here? I ask: Who allowed to shoot?

651
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,160
-Lena. Gazik.

652
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,550
-Let's go, go, go Lena, go.

653
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,650
All the same, the chairman has a walkie-talkie.

654
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,400
-It seems to be surrendering.

655
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:25,400
"Wait!" "Stop telling you!" Wait!

656
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,570
-Discharge the device, give me the tape.

657
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,440
- What for? - Just in case.

658
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,670
- It's all? -All. - Good.

659
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,400
- Hello. - Hello.

660
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,776
-Let us invite you for a cup of tea.

661
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,840
“With pleasure, but ... we're in a hurry!”

662
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,280
-You have already done your work,

663
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,890
I think it would be impolite to leave just like that.

664
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,826
-Oh well. You go ahead, and we are behind you.

665
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,680
-Ha. I’d better follow you, and he will go ahead.

666
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,780
- Is he? - Yeah. - I will show the way.

667
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,450
-Welcome, and you too.

668
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,420
-Please pass.

669
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:02,040
Make yourself at home.

670
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,760
- You? -Hi. - What are you doing here? -And you?

671
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,020
- I’m shooting from the satirical department how the crop is dying in this economy.

672
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,640
-And I'm preparing material about the chairman of this advanced economy.

673
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,920
- This is Alexander Petrovich. - I see.

674
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,560
He helps me.

675
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,720
-Very dramatic.

676
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,980
- Sit down ... Colleagues.

677
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,160
- Thank. - Thank.

678
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,760
- Thank. - Enjoy your meal!

679
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,910
- Delicious. - Hello dear guests!

680
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,160
- These are my colleagues, Andrei Stepanovich. - I see.

681
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,550
- Bon appetit, as they say.

682
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,640
-Well?

683
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:24,680
As far as I understand, there was a mismatch, so what?

684
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,560
One, you know, came to praise me,

685
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,360
and you mean scolding. Well, it happens.

686
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,900
We are used to it. Thanks Light, thanks!

687
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,620
Yes friends, it’s a shame at the expense of apples. Rotting. And why?

688
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,420
They called us to understand, to grow gardens,

689
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,610
raise their productivity.

690
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:51,180
But with the construction of storage facilities, factories, a little late.

691
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,940
And this is not only with us.

692
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:56,280
So it turns out, also a kind of - inconsistency.

693
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,377
It's a pity!

694
01:00:57,401 --> 01:01:00,810
It is a pity for human labor, because people are not to blame here!

695
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,130
- Well, and you all the more.

696
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,170
A month later, Andrei Stepanovich celebrates his anniversary.

697
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,346
- He's here, 30 years old. 30 yes? - Yeah.

698
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,590
- Come on, don’t be modest Andrey Stepanovich, do not be modest.

699
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,000
-What idiot sent you here?

700
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:18,920
- Yes, in general, we ourselves are somehow accidental. - Ah, there it is.

701
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,680
- Well then, everything is much simpler.

702
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,370
You will have lunch now, get in the car, and go to another collective farm.

703
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,147
-Good. Yeah.

704
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:28,616
- I think the same thing there, if not worse. Yes? - Yes Yes Yes!

705
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,800
- Everywhere, absolutely the same picture. Yes!

706
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,020
-And you are removing the film ...

707
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,906
present to Andrey Stepanovich for the anniversary.

708
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,670
- Well there is no problem! - Good girl!

709
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,460
-Alexander Petrovich?

710
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,100
Sasha, please give me the tapes!

711
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,970
- The removed films Elena Pavlovna are with me, and I will give them to you ...

712
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,780
- Will not give it back! -But they are mine. - Lena, pity ...

713
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,240
bad adviser. How much is our lunch?

714
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,600
-What's wrong with you? Andrei Stepanovich is bad!

715
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,060
- Oh. - Drink water, Andrey Stepanovich, drink!

716
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,880
-Lena, we have to go! Lena?

717
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:12,120
- I'm not going with you! Give me the tapes.

718
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,356
- Well, in that case, I'll take them to television myself!

719
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,920
-Give the films immediately!

720
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,980
- Maybe call a doctor? - Sorry, I didn’t want to.

721
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,760
- I am also very sorry! - Captain, give me the tapes!

722
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,940
-You go with him, but act according to circumstances!

723
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,040
- How are you feeling? Maybe ... - Come on, you understand!

724
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,110
-You know, Elena. My father always told me:

725
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,690
"If you don’t know what to do, act according to the law."

726
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:04,880
I have a piece of the border that I have to guard. It's my duty!

727
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,920
If I don’t do it,

728
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,310
any links: For illness,

729
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,880
anniversaries, spoiled careers - will not help me.

730
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,040
Why should it be different here? AND?

731
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,020
-Because here is not the border.

732
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,220
- I hope you change your mind.

733
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,620
And I'm sure that, in the end,

734
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,860
you will understand me.

735
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,590
- Gave the tone.

736
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,600
-Do not. Leave in the car.

737
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,920
- Thank. -It's my pleasure. - Take the keys.

738
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,040
-Lena!

739
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,440
-Lena!

740
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,680
- That would not change your mind.

741
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:11,450
-Shura! I would go eat!

742
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,500
I didn’t eat anything in the morning.

743
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,160
-You know what, mother ... I'll go to the city.

744
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,040
I’m going for a walk.

745
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,840
-Take a walk, take a walk.

746
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,400
- Hello, can Elena Pavlovna? - Her not.

747
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:16,080
- Sorry Kondraty Petrovich, this is Captain Blinov says.

748
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,000
“Well, she really isn’t, Comrade Captain.

749
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,660
- Sorry, sorry.

750
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,300
-Captain...

751
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:39,316
- Hello. - Hello.

752
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,190
- What fate? - Here, I'm waiting for Lena.

753
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,710
- Waiting for Lena? - Yeah.

754
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,370
“So my chances are zero.” “They told me she was coming soon.”

755
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,750
-Coming soon? Wait, I recognize through my channels.

756
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,300
Hello, Marya Kirilovna.

757
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,120
- Hello, this is Pauline. Where is Elena today?

758
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:11,440
So. And then? And then? Thank.

759
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,496
- So, now she is at a conference in agricultural machinery.

760
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,730
Directly from there goes to the run to the drum theater.

761
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,160
But after the run, he’ll probably go somewhere with the actors.

762
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:28,436
- This is a tradition. - And ... - Is this for a long time?

763
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,520
“Well, you surprise me, captain.” This is not regulated.

764
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,720
-Thank.

765
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,510
-Capitan, sit down on the bench, huh?

766
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,620
- Are you in love or something?

767
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:52,590
-We quarreled.

768
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,800
But I think...

769
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,180
That I can convince her.

770
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,530
-Yes. But if someone else did not convince her, you turned out to be a catalyst.

771
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,260
-Lyadov, he.

772
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,600
- She loves him?

773
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:10,670
“Captain, you need to be shown at the museum.” - Loves.

774
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:13,266
- May I ask you one question? - You are welcome.

775
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:16,750
-Well, what did you find in her? Well, I'm pretty, I guess.

776
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,330
Well, the character is whacky, without a rudder and without sails.

777
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,310
The photographer, between us, is generally mediocre.

778
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,680
-Well, if you were in love and your chosen one would be ...

779
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:32,010
Well, let's say - an average accountant?

780
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,576
- I would not fall in love with an accountant.

781
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,060
- The profession determines. - The profession is taken into account.

782
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,916
Yes, and do not be ironic.

783
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,030
Because, marriages of convenience are no less lasting than of love.

784
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,360
And maybe even more.

785
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:47,800
If Elena marries Lyadov,

786
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:50,800
it will be, as they say now: "Packed."

787
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,326
They are doing one thing, he will help her,

788
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,040
and she’ll get to her feet faster.

789
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,760
-Well, I think: Families are not created to take over

790
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,710
jointly by profession.

791
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,870
For this, there are teams.

792
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,450
"Labor", as our mentors say.

793
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,000
“You like me, captain.”

794
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:18,190
- Goodbye. - Goodbye. Break a leg.

795
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,680
-You?

796
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,840
- Can I enter? - Come in.

797
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:54,000
-Hello.

798
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,770
-Hi, assistant.

799
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,990
-But you can keep these 2 photos for your family album.

800
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,300
Here, too, frank amateurism.

801
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:13,070
You neglect the possibilities of printing.

802
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,370
The left edge needs to be denser. Come here.

803
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,150
But why is everything so - crumbling, falling apart?

804
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,070
Here is a frank chernukha. There is no depth.

805
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:36,856
If your assistant is so persistent in persecuting compatriots,

806
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,090
then he certainly will not miss the enemy. Stubborn gentleman.

807
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,850
-Well, this is no longer your concern.

808
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,280
-You, in fact, in what case?

809
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:53,680
- The thing we have is actually one, only it will be decided individually.

810
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,390
Now is the time, so it’s better for you and me to leave now.

811
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:01,040
- Go away. - Nobody holds you.

812
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:04,190
“But I also consider your visit an accident.”

813
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,130
-From what?

814
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,400
-Lena.

815
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,190
- Captain, what do you want everything?

816
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,740
What are you climbing into my life?

817
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:28,700
I'm an adult. I was married.

818
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:33,480
You that don't know that single women

819
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,790
men visit sometimes.

820
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,230
“You were never married to me.”

821
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,610
And you never had anyone.

822
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,610
Except me.

823
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,820
No one.

824
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:02,750
I am without you,

825
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,490
I am...

826
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,110
Happily.

827
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,540
-Well, it's already masculine.

828
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,060
So where are you and I ... staying here?

829
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,820
Well, decent picture.

830
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,740
Although the right side, it would not hurt to print.

831
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,860
-I am asking you to leave.

832
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,820
- Cool down.

833
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:57,960
Helen.

834
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,020
Chill out.

835
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,800
Do you not remember where I got my umbrella?

836
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:19,900
-He's in the hallway.

837
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:24,680
- Make up your mind, call. Until.

838
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:37,150
“Sit down, captain!”

839
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,910
-I'm sitting, but behind the wheel.

840
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:44,880
“You seem to have a little drink today.” - As you wish.

841
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,240
-Don't worry, captain.

842
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,150
Anyway, nothing good would come of it.

843
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:05,690
By type of service, you spend your life at outposts, in villages and more ...

844
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,840
Well, unless of course you become - General. Do you have a chance to become a General?

845
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,800
- Small ones. - You see.

846
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,500
-And Elena got used to comfort.

847
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:20,400
- Yes, and your character ... - Where now?

848
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,290
-Left.

849
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,740
- I wish you success.

850
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,450
-In combat and political training.

851
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,110
-You take the keys.

852
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:01,800
-Just in case.

853
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,536
Type of outfit: Watch.

854
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,850
Tasks: To prevent impunity for violation of the state border of the USSR.

855
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,480
- Senior outfit: Sergeant Kovboshin. - I AM!

856
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,790
- Questions? - Outfit questions?

857
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:32,040
“Not at all.” - There are no questions, the order is clear.

858
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:36,760
There is a stand to guard the state border of the USSR.

859
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,040
- Follow! - Outfit, to the left!

860
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,320
- To guard the state border, step march!

861
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,170
“Comrade Captain, may I turn?” - Contact!

862
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,096
-Comrade captain, called from the squad,

863
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,936
Major Iosov flies out to us, and with him someone else.

864
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,310
- Allow me to go? - Go out. - There is.

865
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,500
- Well, let's go, Volodya.

866
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,056
-Comrade Major,

867
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,846
on the state border without incident.

868
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,336
- Hi. - I wish you good health.

869
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,740
-Elena Pavlovna Zhuravleva, photojournalist.

870
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,230
-Kapitan Blinov Alexander Petrovich, head of the outpost.

871
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:51,730
-Work.

872
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,456
-Elena Pavlovna is shooting here at your shooting range and her fellow countrymen.

873
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,370
- By the way, you are also her fellow countryman. “It's hard to believe that.”

874
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,820
- I have to believe, captain.

875
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:04,680
-Where do we start? We have 40 minutes at this outpost.

876
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,870
-I would like to talk with the captain, to interview.

877
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,240
-Come on Sasha, invite the correspondent.

878
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,930
-I ask you!

879
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,600
- Hello. - Hello.

880
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,856
-Comrade Major, Deputy Head of the outpost, Captain Ivanchenko.

881
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,030
-Comrade Major, deputy chief of the outpost for political affairs, Lieutenant Goulet.

882
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:34,760
“You think it was easy for me to get here?”

883
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,870
Why don't you answer my letters?

884
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:40,250
“There were reasons for that.” - What kind?

885
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,360
-This is a difficult question.

886
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,920
-Sit!

887
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:52,520
-Are you married? -No.

888
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,990
- Do you have another woman? - Not.

889
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,110
- Well then, this is not such a difficult question?

890
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,130
- They are waiting for us at the shooting range, Elena Pavlovna.

891
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:03,770
-Small! To the battle!

892
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,150
- Become here. - Fire!

893
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,920
- Alexander Petrovich? “One minute, I'm busy.”

894
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:25,990
-Thank.

895
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:40,840
- Hello. - Hello.

896
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:43,206
- Let’s shoot. - Do you charge?

897
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,586
“No, I think I can handle it.” - You are welcome.

898
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:46,800
-I saw it in the movies.

899
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,500
- Thank. - You are welcome.

900
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,480
-Comrade Warrant Officer: 8, 8, 9.

901
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:04,140
-Fine result.

902
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,640
- Have you been involved in shooting sports before?

903
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,990
- No, it's just that I have such a mood today.

904
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,890
- Excuse me. - Nothing.

905
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,816
-So how did your young soldiers shoot back?

906
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,960
- Fine, Siberians are good guys. - They shoot well.

907
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:21,206
- The hunters. - Comrade Major, may I turn?

908
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,670
- I’m listening to you, Elena Pavlovna.

909
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,370
-I would like to remove the captain, on that picturesque background.

910
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:27,426
- Comrade Major ... - I don’t need a major.

911
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,770
- Follow the correspondent. - There is.

912
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,840
- Thank. - You are welcome.

913
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,130
- Where are we going? -I am looking for the background. “Get over there.” -There?

914
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,180
-So?

915
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,990
- To take off? - Yes.

916
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,570
-Slightly to the right.

917
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,920
-So why do not you answer my letters?

918
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,450
-Because we are not suitable for each other.

919
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,630
You have a different life, different goals.

920
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,780
- I have no goals.

921
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,900
-What is Lena with you?

922
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,480
-I want to marry you.

923
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,600
-Why?

924
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:07,610
-Because I love.

925
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,090
-I have a bad temper.

926
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:26,970
-Me too.

927
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,160
-Comrade correspondent, you have to go! Time to fly!
