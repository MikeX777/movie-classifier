17
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,410
- Don't beat him!

18
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,680
- Don't beat him! He's just hungry.

19
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,213
- I'll tear his skin off!

20
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,186
Get away, or you'll get a trashing too!

21
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,410
- Take this, please.
Is it enough?

22
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,320
- Do you want to have the Blue Bird?

23
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:23,160
Take it. It's yours.
It's my gift to you.

24
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,160
- Remember, my boy.

25
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:36,290
You're holding a priceless treasure -
the Blue Bird.

26
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,370
The Blue Bird can't be bought or sold.
It might be only given.

27
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,990
Only given...

28
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,930
- You're not allowed in, understand?

29
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,450
If you want, wait for me here.

30
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:54,186
- But what did you go there for, mom?

31
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,706
- I've put flowers on their grave.

32
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,500
- I do remember granddad too.
He liked to play violin.

33
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,780
And grandma always told me tales.
- But I don't remember them at all.

34
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:11,540
- Mom, why have they died?

35
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,940
- Good night.

36
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,120
- Good night, mommy.
- Good night, mom.

37
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,470
- Are you sleeping?
- And you?

38
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:32,320
- I want to tell you a secret.
But don't reveal it to anyone!

39
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,910
- Look, mom has forgotten
to switch the lamp off!

40
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,690
- Just a moment.

41
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,800
- Oh! It still lights!

42
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,390
- What's that?
- I don't know. Let's go and find out.

43
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:33,060
- Well?... What?...What?

44
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:37,190
- What, what... Nothing to hear.

45
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:45,070
- Don't you have the Blue Bird?

46
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,870
- Grandma! Grandad!..
So they're alive!

47
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:53,906
- Grandma, Granddad!
So you actually haven't died?

48
00:13:53,973 --> 00:14:01,360
- What are you saying! Just listen to him.
He's using unintelligible expressions.

49
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:11,280
"Died"! What's that?!
Some new word, eh? a new cult thing?

50
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:20,580
- Granddad... Grandma...
- How have you grown up!

51
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:27,786
And who's that girl? Who's she?
Isn't that our granddaughter?

52
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:32,190
- Yes, it's our granddaughter.
When we left her, she was just a baby.

53
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:35,800
- Ohhh! How she looks like me!

54
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,650
- Well, that's only your imagination.
She looks like me.

55
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,910
- Yes?
- Yes!

56
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:44,070
- Bro! Who are you talking to?

57
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,780
- Don't you see them?
Granddad and grandma.

58
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,310
- There's nobody there.
Only old things, plus it's quit dark.

59
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,426
And granddad with grandma
have died many years ago.

60
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,650
- There! You're always doing this!...
- Don't be angry at your sister.

61
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:08,760
She can't see us. Because we
only come to life in memories.

62
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:12,093
And she has no memories of us.
She doesn't remember.

63
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,090
- I'll tell everything to mom.

64
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:18,040
You've promised to show me the Blue Bird,
but now you're making fun of me!

65
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,893
There!

66
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:22,413
- Where,...where's my Blue Bird?

67
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,020
- Tell me, why do you hold
the Blue bird in a cage?

68
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,480
- Because it's mine.
- Yours?

69
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,910
- Yes.
- No, you're wrong!

70
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,853
The Blue Bird belongs to everybody!

71
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,066
To all who are kind, honest and brave.

72
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,586
It must fly over the Earth in freedom!

73
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:47,800
- But it was a gift to me!
And I'm happy with it...

74
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:51,866
- How can you feel happy on your own,
if other people are unhappy?

75
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:55,546
- But if I'll let it go,
I'll become unhappy too.

76
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,840
- Who knows, who knows...

77
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:02,840
- When you're keeping happiness
only for yourself, it's easily lost.

78
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,810
- Do believe us, we did spent a long time living...
- Indeed, a long time.

79
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,520
- Hurry down!

80
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,230
- My little friend!

81
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,290
I love, love, love you!

82
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,390
And you I love too! You too!

83
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:03,600
- Give me back the coin.
It's mine, it's my coin.

84
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,970
- Am I satisfied? I'm satisfied.
I'm satisfied.

85
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:21,270
Now I wish to make you happy
with my company.

86
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,030
You will be my guests.

87
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,320
- We cannot, we're searching
the Blue Bird.

88
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:33,800
- The Blue Bird?
But I'm searching the Blue Bird too.

89
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,546
- Why do you need it?

90
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,690
- You'll learn that now.

91
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:16,720
- Please.

92
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,460
- What's that?

93
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,530
- It's my War.

94
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,550
The two biggest ones have died,

95
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,546
but now I'm growing a third one,
and the generals I've bought

96
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:04,170
advise me to feed my little one
with the Blue Bird.

97
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:09,106
They promise that the new war will grow
incredibly huge then

98
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,440
and will conquer the entire world for me.

99
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,720
The entire world.

100
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,860
But I can't buy that darn
Blue Bird anywhere!

101
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,546
- I'm afraid! I want to go home!

102
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:06,066
- Just a moment. I'll give you
sweets, and you'll forget everything.

103
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,530
- But the Blue Bird...
- Rubbish, rubbish.

104
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,440
If I already can't obtain it with my money,
you will not be able to find it even more.

105
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,826
Don't obstruct me! Otherwise, for
your own well being, I'll use violence.

106
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:48,690
- Don't take it!
Don't take anything from this table.

107
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,610
Or you'll never find the Blue Bird.
The Blue Bird...

108
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,840
- You're seeking the Blue Bird?
There isn't one here.

109
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:18,490
- We've gotten so hungry!
- You got hungry?

110
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:21,770
Take this. Have some bread.

111
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,320
- How sweet! I have never eaten
anything tastier than this bread.

112
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:35,940
- And me too!
- And me!

113
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:45,890
- Listen! Listen! Listen!

114
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:51,110
The Night conceived a black deed.

115
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:57,330
It's her that sent her sidekick, the Cat,

116
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:05,780
to steal the Blue Bird from you...
the blue Bird...

117
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:14,010
Today before sunrise

118
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:19,500
Night wants to sell the Blue Bird
to the fat Rich man.

119
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:28,660
If you don't prevent that, the Rich man
will throw the Blue Bird into the War's jaws...

120
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:34,030
...into the War's jaws...

121
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:39,540
and an irretrievable disaster
will happen to the Earth.

122
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,210
Hurry on!...

123
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,550
Hurry on!... Hurry on!...

124
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:50,920
You'll be assisted
by...Fire...

125
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,670
...Water...

126
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,640
...Bread...

127
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,040
They all are ancient helpmates of man

128
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,470
and will
serve you faithfully.

129
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,760
Farewell!..

130
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,780
- Hurry on, human!

131
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:58,280
We all will follow you,
because you carry the light.

132
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,960
- Leave me be!

133
00:45:36,826 --> 00:45:40,026
It's my bird! I bought it!

134
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,146
- No!
It can't be bought.

135
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,933
It must fly over the Earth in freedom.

136
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:23,760
