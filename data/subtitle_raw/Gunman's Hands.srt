What's wrong?

20
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,492
Just had my nightmare as usual.

21
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,789
You mustn't think about it any more dan.

22
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,990
We still have everything in the world to 
make us happy

23
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,980

(Music)

38
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,060
You like it?
Oh It's simply marvolous, Pat.

39
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,300
Pat, we will be able to swim in the river.

40
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,180
And thats where we put the hen house, huh!

41
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,300
It's wonderful, Pat.
And I'm so happy.

42
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,352
Well you haven't told me
if I have painted it well.

43
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,232
You do not like?

44
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:48,608
How so silly. Yes, offcourse i like it.

45
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,816
Hello Miriam!

46
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:54,860
Hello!
Hello!

47
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,527
That is a cute little house.
All it missing is the doll.

48
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,840
I can give you the bows
for the porch.

49
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,996
Pat, don't listen to him.
Now I understand.

50
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,738
You want to make yourself the little man in front
from her, huh?

51
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,184
Hi Margaret.
Hello dan.

52
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:14,143
Something wrong?

53
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,554
How are you, Pat?
What's up?

54
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,616
Caramba!
But if it is Charlie Castle.

55
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,633
Annoying as always, right?
Why don't you let him defend himself?

56
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:30,300
Oh, sure...
Too child.

57
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:32,338
You feel very safe, right?

58
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,881
Do you think that always
they are going to get you out of trouble

59
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:36,802
those three thugs
What do you have for brothers?

60
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,116
I'm wrong?
What do you think, nosy?

61
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,180
I will have to give you
some spanking if you don't go.

62
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,514
Come on, be a good boy.

63
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,300
(LAUGH)

64
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,380
It is not always good to go unarmed,
Dan?

65
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,940
You keep it up, boy.

66
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,732
I've already told you before.

67
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:11,349
The opposite is starting a career
that carries death around.

68
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,224
Let's leave that.

69
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,607
You like?

70
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,580
The truth is that I have never seen
nothing like it.

71
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,780
Well, when is the wedding?
In three days.

72
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:29,784
Do you want to see the house inside?
No no no. Not now, another day.

73
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:33,029
Let's go to town, I have to buy
some provisions.

74
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,700
Andy, come on.
Yes Dad. I'm going.

75
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:55,625
I'm going to see Alex
you go buying things.

76
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:58,980
Dad, I'm going with you.

77
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,018
Boys like you must not step
never a salon.

78
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,822
You better go help mom.
Dad is right, Andy.

79
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,424
Bye.
Goodbye, Miriam.

80
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,283
Goodbye dad.
Goodbye son.

81
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,065
(Suspense music)

82
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,340
One moment, hero.

83
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:38,791
I have found out that you wanted to give
some whipping Charlie.

84
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,768
Why don't you try me?
You don't lack courage.

85
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,740
Or do you lack?

86
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,565
Why are you unarmed?

87
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:52,947
Have.

88
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,300
-It's useless, boss.
He's just a coward.

89
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,700
-It may just be
a peaceful man.

90
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,401
Can't shoot?
Too easy.

91
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,987
(Shots)

92
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,780
(LAUGH)

93
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,614
Hi Alex.
Give me a beer.

94
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:52,655
What's up, Dan?

95
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,620
I saw you chat with the Castles.
What did they want?

96
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:59,315
You can already imagine it.
As usual.

97
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:01,880
They enjoy teasing people.
What have you told them?

98
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Richard is a quiet man.
I like it that way.

99
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:07,845
Well buried is forever,
Dan Murphy.

100
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:11,140
Yes, it is well buried.

101
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,711
But patience has a limit.

102
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,672
I just saw your girl and Pat.
They have shown me their new home.

103
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,883
What about the house?

104
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,719
They have painted it
between yellow and orange.

105
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,469
Then, to break the monotony,

106
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,630
they have put a little green
on the windows.

107
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,172
The green windows?

108
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:34,292
I have to tell you the truth, Alex.
I found him a little effeminate.

109
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:38,474
Come on, it makes you throw up.

110
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,604
After all, they are
those who have to live inside.

111
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:44,148
Three days to go, right?
Yes.

112
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,195
It turns out to think that there will be
to put on the new suit.

113
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:48,687
You tell me?

114
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:51,953
I will have to search through the trunks
my wedding dress.

115
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,398
It will be tight too.

116
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,840
Unlike.

117
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,341
Luckily the daughters get married
just once.

118
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:07,996
-Just a moment!

119
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,180
There is nobody here?

120
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,331
I drink it all.

121
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,892
Today I will not
mind getting drunk.

122
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:19,972
I'll start with this.

123
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:22,537
-You can leave the money
on the counter.

124
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:28,025
-Hi, boss.
From what I see, it's a party.

125
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,693
-I think so, friend.
Today my daughter is getting married.

126
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,060
Margaret, are you missing a lot?
Pat is coming.

127
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,261
I'm coming, dad.

128
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:40,186
What is said a great day.
We can celebrate, right?

129
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,076
-Drink what you want.

130
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,212
(Barking)

131
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:49,431
Here we have you, Margaret.
Your boyfriend is here.

132
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,700
Anytime, dad.

133
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,460
Hi, Custer.

134
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:08,498
Come on quickly, Margaret.
The judge is waiting for us.

135
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:11,131
Take care of this while I go back.
Custer.

136
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,605
You heard me.

137
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,936
- Am I the master of everything?
-Yes of all.

138
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:19,725
(HIPA)

139
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,334
Pat, do you want Margaret for a wife?
Yes, I want.

140
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:24,428
What about you, Margaret?
Do you want him?

141
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,537
I love you very much, Your Honor.

142
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:30,646
So in the name of the law
and from this moment on,

143
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,904
I declare you husband and wife.

144
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,340
What are you waiting to hug her?

145
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:38,955
With permission, huh?

146
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:49,814
Invite this friend.

147
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,610
-Thanks Alex.

148
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,521
-Happy children?
Much.

149
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,740
(Music)

150
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,380
Dan.

151
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,623
And Andy?
He's already asleep, let's dance.

152
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,607
I said drink.
Where are you going? Baby.

153
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:12,820
That's better.

154
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,380
Look at her, Charlie.
This can take away your grief.

155
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:18,325
-Leave her.

156
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,949
-Okay, I'll kiss her for you.

157
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,896
-It's okay, Johnny,
let's go from here.

158
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:36,060
- Make that face happy, Charlie.
Do you know what we are going to do?

159
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,247
Go to the living room.
We know the bride and groom and the father.

160
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,270
So,
Why not go congratulate him?

161
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,965
-Yes, why not.

162
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:45,278
(Music)

163
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:50,285
I have to tell something strange
what happened to me this morning.

164
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,683
-That you have drunk.

165
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:56,348
-And what don't you know
what has it cost me?

166
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:57,364
-Nothing.

167
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,270
-I bet with everyone
that you are the judge.

168
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,184
-Just, you've been right too.
-Like I'm very smart.

169
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:16,489
-Come on, try to catch air
out there

170
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,106
if you don't want that tonight
make you sleep in the cool.

171
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,700
(Music)

172
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,500
I can not anymore,
this has not been done for me.

173
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,068
No one does it like you.

174
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:35,391
I didn't know you as a dancer.
Me neither.

175
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:37,290
A bit more please.

176
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:38,527
(Music)

177
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:51,571
Boys here it is
the lucky father.

178
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,100
-What do you want?

179
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,358
-Nice party.
Too bad we're not invited.

180
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:58,814
-Yes, I really don't understand it,
because we are clients.

181
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,790
Isn't that right, Alex?
-We just want to congratulate Margaret.

182
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:02,751
-So.

183
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,759
-Ah, the weapons.
Fair, Alex, you're right.

184
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,818
This is a party, guys.

185
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,700
(Music)

186
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:38,740
Give me a beer please.

187
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:42,060
To your health.
Leave me alone.

188
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:46,512
You will regret it Margaret
and he will regret it too.

189
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,985
I said leave me alone.
Listen to me!

190
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,600
Say sorry.
Pat, drop it.

191
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,620
I don't want fights here
not worth it.

192
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:00,921
You, Charlie, go away.

193
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,500
Let's go.
Come on, Pat, it's all over.

194
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:09,971
I'm going to have fun for a bit.

195
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,360
Let's see, a little music.

196
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,848
(Happy music)

197
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,974
Can i have the honor
to dance with you?

198
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,355
Get out.

199
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,940
I have asked the lady.

200
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,646
Get out, I said.
I hope she answers me.

201
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:36,904
Dan, leave him, leave him.
Dan.

202
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:05,208
I had been told that this
it was a quiet town.

203
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,420
(Screams)

204
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,716
Freeze Johnny
drop that gun.

205
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,300
You will sleep al fresco,
I think it will do you good.

206
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,701
Let's go.

207
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:34,047
-Let's go from here.
We will wait for a better time.

208
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,888
-I'm sure it will come.

209
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,748
-Please, gentlemen, let's not close
tonight with a long face

210
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:43,220
The incident happened.
The House invites.

211
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:44,416
(Happy music)

212
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,537
Yes Alex is right
let's have a drink.

213
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,270
(Happy music)

214
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,460
I have to tell one thing ...
-Leave me alone.

215
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:58,685
-Murphy.

216
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,700
(Happy music)

217
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,300
Do you remember me?

218
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,935
We met last time
long time ago.

219
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,678
What do you want?
I have to talk to you.

220
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:15,474
Do it.

221
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:17,951
Alone.

222
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,060
(Music)

223
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:26,058
Do not worry,
I'll be right back.

224
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,580
(Music)

225
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:32,388
I'm going to tell you one thing ...

226
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:34,646
-He doesn't tell me.
Hala, to sleep.

227
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,092
-Well, I have it
to tell someone.

228
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:40,173
Why did you come?

229
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,740
To finish a job
that started four years ago.

230
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:45,295
Speak up for once.

231
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,553
I come to you to settle an account
that you have pending with the law.

232
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,514
That means
What are you coming to stop me?

233
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,660
I warn you that it is not easy.

234
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,053
In this state
you do not represent the law.

235
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:03,774
I have not come for you.

236
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,620
It's the child
the one who will come with me.

237
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:08,217
What are you saying?

238
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,454
I'm not the one saying it, Dan.

239
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,865
You know better than anyone
that you have no right

240
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:16,420
to hold the boy.

241
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,152
You will not take it.

242
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:22,974
Think about it slowly.
I give you until tomorrow.

243
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,256
He will not take it.
Andy will stay here.

244
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,623
Please Dan
don't wake up.

245
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,709
I am able to kill that man
rather than let him take it away.

246
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:36,474
What would become of us
if we lost it?

247
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,416
I don't know, I don't want to think.

248
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,940
It's cruel and still I believe
what is necessary.

249
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:48,146
What?

250
00:21:52,383 --> 00:21:54,023
Try to understand me.

251
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,220
(Music)

252
00:21:57,998 --> 00:21:59,044
It is for your good.

253
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,740
Do you know what Andy
It means to me?

254
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,295
After what happened with Roger
that day...

255
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:09,416
Shut up!

256
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,420
You should calm down, Dan.

257
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,980
I know,
I know what you're thinking.

258
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,740
We had created a life
and we have tried to defend it.

259
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,068
Maybe it was selfishness.

260
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,220
But the thread was false
that kept her.

261
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,693
Sooner or later
it had to break.

262
00:22:25,774 --> 00:22:27,451
Those are just words.
Andy ...

263
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:30,123
Andy died
died four years ago.

264
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,262
Yes, we replace you.

265
00:22:35,343 --> 00:22:38,231
We had come to believe
that it was ours, that it belonged to us.

266
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,028
But there is a law
that goes beyond our affection,

267
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:44,528
of our feelings.

268
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,114
I took what had been taken from me.
I know.

269
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,286
I know and I understand you.

270
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:54,268
It really is like
our son,

271
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:56,316
because it has grown together with us.

272
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:59,083
We deposit in him
all our love

273
00:22:59,164 --> 00:23:01,215
maybe because it started
to mitigate our pain.

274
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:03,700
But it is not ours.

275
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:05,747
You and i know
that his father is Roger.

276
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:07,684
That man killed our son.

277
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,294
What can we do? Run away?

278
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,765
Where?
Time will pass, Andy will grow,

279
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:20,711
but the law will always be there
willing to take it from us.

280
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,300
(Suspense music)

281
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:41,592
(Whinny)

282
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,458
As you move, I'll kill you.

283
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,199
(Whinny)

284
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:40,991
(Suspense music)

285
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:01,072
(Barking)

286
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,666
Don't run, come, come.

287
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:13,179
Custer come on
Take, take.

288
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,540
Let's go.

289
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:23,680
Don't step on me
get off me.

290
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,547
Hey Custer, do you have anything
what to tell me about your new mistress?

291
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:35,899
Yes I understand.
You love her, right?

292
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:37,621
She loves you too.

293
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:39,575
Margaret!

294
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,279
Margaret!

295
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:47,739
What happen?
Custer says he loves you.

296
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,211
(Laughs)
I love him too.

297
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:57,122
You heard it, Custer,
you can be calm.

298
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,110
You see?
It doesn't take much to be happy.

299
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:06,360
A beautiful woman, a raised house
with your own hands,

300
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:09,401
a piece of land to work

301
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:13,299
and a faithful dog.

302
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,985
(LADRA)

303
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:19,339
Margaret!
Doesn't it take much?

304
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,739
What are you talking about, Pat?
Much for what?

305
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,399
To be happy.
It depends.

306
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:29,580
Women sometimes
they do not understand anything.

307
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:35,476
Listen please,
Does Dan Murphy live near here?

308
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:37,963
I don't know any
that is called like that.

309
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,257
I think now
his name is Richard Marky.

310
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,929
Follow the river bed
next is his cabin.

311
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,820
(Barking)

312
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:00,815
Margaret! I have to see Dan.
Something wrong?

313
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:05,101
I don't know, but the stranger
who arrived last night knows his name

314
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:06,620
and is a representative of the law.

315
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:09,006
I have sent you
down the longest road.

316
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,593
I have to let you know
before it arrives.

317
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,284
Good morning, Miriam!
Hello Pat!

318
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:39,927
Hello dan!
What's up, Pat?

319
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:44,698
How are you?
Good.

320
00:27:44,854 --> 00:27:47,182
Hey dan i don't know if
it will be important,

321
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:49,059
but the individual
who arrived last night is coming here

322
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,180
(Suspense music)

323
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:52,728
What has happened to you?

324
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,740
Nothing.

325
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,609
Tonight I had the visit
from the Castle brothers.

326
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,539
I can help you with something?
Not at all, boy, you already have.

327
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:05,862
Thanks for your notice.

328
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,619
Now go away
must be when that man arrives.

329
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,900
(Music)

330
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,060
Andy.
I'm feeding the chickens.

331
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,820
(Music)

332
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,973
(Suspense music)

333
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,995
We are leaving!

334
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,900
-Bye, Dan, good luck.
Thank you.

335
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,479
Goodbye, ma'am.

336
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,081
Learn to write soon,
so we will hear from you.

337
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:20,120
Yes mom.
Kiss Me.

338
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,925
You have to be good, huh?
Sure it will.

339
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:33,575
Good and brave,
Right, Andy?

340
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:35,987
When are you coming to see me, dad?

341
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,706
Soon.

342
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:45,128
Coming Soon.

343
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,774
(Music)

344
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,700
Goodbye, my son.
Come on, Andy.

345
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,500
(Music)

346
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,907
Goodbye! Bye, Mom!

347
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,460
Goodbye Andy!

348
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,306
Goodbye dad!
Goodbye son!

349
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,540
Remember that Dan
stay away.

350
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,931
It's advice.

351
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,460
(Music)

352
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,860
Wait for me a moment.
I'm going to talk to the sheriff.

353
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,580
I'll go see Mack.

354

(Music)

355
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,210
What happened to you?

356
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:07,228
Johnny's brothers
They were at my house last night.

357
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,593
And good?
I come to report it, Fred.

358
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,023
I hope that as a representative
of the law you stop them.

359
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,247
Accused of what?

360
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,515
It was a brave retaliation
for my incident with Johnny.

361
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,240
Do not worry,
I will talk with them.

362
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,812
That's it?

363
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:28,683
What else can we do?
Judge them.

364
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:32,316
I'll try if you want it
but they will deny the accusation.

365
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,820
We would need
some other test

366
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:35,410
than your own testimony.

367
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:37,363
Isn't it enough?
For me if.

368
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:39,206
I've come to warn you.

369
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,488
So far i've held on
one after another his bravado,

370
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,371
but from now on
it will not be so.

371
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:48,097
I am the first who wants to end
with the attitude of those men.

372
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:52,152
If I had concrete proof,
I assure you that I would lock them up.

373
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,189
Do you have that proof?

374
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,400
Okay fred
I have nothing to say to you.

375
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,853
Warn them,
something tied my hands,

376
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,908
but that something ends
to leave in the diligence.

377
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:08,908
Now everything is different, tell him.

378
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,369
Tell them not to cross over
on my way.

379
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:13,877
Calm down,
you must be calm.

380
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:19,470
I already had it, Fred,
many years of calm.

381
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:22,841

384
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:41,707
Look what a beautiful town.

385
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:44,420
You will see how well you have a good time
when you go to school.

386
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,590
-And where is the school?
-There.

387
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,035
This man is called Roger,
he's the sheriff here.

388
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:55,203
You will live with him.

389
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,523
-Hello.

390
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:03,608
-You are...?
-Andy.

391
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,780
-I hope you are very well
by my side.

392
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:16,834
-Dad said
that I will be very well.

393
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,156
(Suspense music)

394
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,811
And the?

395
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:31,399
-He seems a very different man.

396
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,670
-Why didn't you bring him?
-For many reasons, Roger.

397
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,460
I could have brought a corpse
or the dead would have been me,

398
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,647
in which case we wouldn't be here
neither.

399
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,998
It is better to close the account like this.

400
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:45,750
-For me it is still pending.

401
00:34:57,992 --> 00:34:59,312
-Good Morning.

402
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,484
I am used to it
to answer me.

403
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:08,194
Let me go.

404
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,116
Loose!

405
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,006
You have learned to make a worse face.

406
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,620
Margaret don't like them
faces like that.

407
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,123
But I will change
to your little dove.

408
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,060
-Harder, come on.

409
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:07,729

416
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:04,139
Who was it?
Who was it?

417
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:07,615
-I was fighting with Pat when Alex
shot him in the back.

418
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:12,045
-Why didn't you avoid it?
Why did you let them kill him?

419
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:14,889
-I've arrived late,
everything had already passed.

420
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,686
Nothing could be done,
I swear.

421
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:31,380
-I'll kill Alex!
I will kill him!

422
00:38:33,954 --> 00:38:35,354
(Suspense music)

423
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:56,233
Let's go.

(Music)

425
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:19,569
Hey you.
Where is Alex?

426
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:22,241
-He and Pat are in custody
for Charlie's death.

427
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:24,726
-Thank you.

428
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:29,687
-Well what do we do?
-Now I'll tell you, let's go.

429
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,420
Please Sheriff
let me go see Margaret.

430
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:34,892
I already told her that she is alone
and she knows nothing of what happened.

431
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:36,468
I give you my word that I will return.

432
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:39,562
Listen, son, if I have stopped you,
I have done it for your sake.

433
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:42,858
Revenge is a bad thing
especially,

434
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:44,659
when they are in between
the Castle brothers.

435
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:48,407
You are not responsible at all
of Charlie's death.

436
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,860
Does that mean I can go?

437
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:53,038
I advise you not to move from here

438
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,538
until they calm down
cheers up, boy.

439
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,313
Thanks for the advice,
But I must go

440
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:01,749
I'll come see you tomorrow, Alex, I'm sorry
that you find yourself in this situation

441
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,670
because of me.

442
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,054
I did it because it was fair.

443
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,358
Come on, boy, go see Margaret.
She will be uneasy.

444
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,585
Agree.
What will happen to him, Sheriff?

445
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,660
Only the judge can say.

446
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:17,546
But considering
the circumstances,

447
00:40:17,627 --> 00:40:19,288
I hope it's not
too severe.

448
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:21,085
Did you hear, Alex?
Everything will be fine.

449

Let's go from here.

453
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:19,702
Come.

454
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:35,700
Margaret.

455
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,608
Margaret!

456
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,522

Dan.

464
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,444
What?

465
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,077
It is a fire.

466
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:09,102
And near Pat's cabin.

467
00:43:10,343 --> 00:43:11,413
I'll see what happens.

00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:33,179

470
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,180
Fred, open the door.

471
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,046
-You heard it.
And don't try anything, it would be useless.

472
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,284
Be careful Johnny
you're going to regret this.

473
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:26,241
That man
he has murdered my brother.

474
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:28,984
-Justice will say whether or not it has been
a murder.

475
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,563
-I am now justice.

476
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:43,892

-Listen to me well.
You will remember me, I will kill you.

488
00:46:48,464 --> 00:46:50,289
I swear I'll kill you!

489
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,961

at the sheriff's office. Come on.

How are you up?
It is Sunrising.

497
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,193
What has happened?

498
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,357
They have killed Margaret,
Alex and Pat.

499
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:58,740
OMG.

500
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,170
Who was it?

501
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:09,638
I'm sure all of this
It is the work of the Castle,

502
00:48:09,726 --> 00:48:12,607
although they made people believe
who shot Alex

503
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:14,201
when he tried to run away.

504
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,857
And why to Margaret and Pat?

505
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:19,300
I hope to know right away.

506
00:48:21,408 --> 00:48:22,648
What are you thinking?

507
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,248

intervene in this,

It's too late.

Miriam.

What's up?

517
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,107
-You have to go to town
for more wire.

518
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:23,326
Well, I'm coming.

519
00:49:24,387 --> 00:49:27,091
-I'm going to the ranch while he comes back.
You get on with this.

520
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,385
Davy!
Get down from there!

521
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:01,635
what do you want?

522
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,682
I have come to give you an award
for your feat last night.

523
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:06,297
Low!

524
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:12,980
I am unarmed.
Pat was too.

525
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:14,986
What do you say?
I do not know what you're talking about.

526
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,253
Henry.

00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,900
This is downloaded.

528
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,534
And this, this other,
with a single bullet.

529
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,847
I'll give you a chance

530
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:40,979
it's like a game.

531
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:41,995
You will see.

532
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,492
Show him.

533
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,980
Now you will take one of the two.

534
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:48,784
And if you are lucky ...
534
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:58.818
Anytime.

535
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,500
(Suspense music)

536
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:38,146
Come closer Davy
you are a bad shooter.

537
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:41,068
And still hopefully
You only have one bullet.

538
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,900
(Suspense music)

539
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,580
Do not be nervous.

540
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,740
(Suspense music)

541
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:00,552
You still have two chances.

542
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,580
(Suspense music)

543
00:52:23,065 --> 00:52:26,748
Pat and Alex killed Charlie!
They deserved death!

544
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,793
(Shooting)

545
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:33,301
(Suspense music)

546
00:52:55,657 --> 00:52:57,826
Soo! Soo!

547
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:01,239
Still!

548
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,912
(Suspense music)

549
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:10,105
Skipper, come on!

550
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,701
They killed Davy!

551
00:53:21,149 --> 00:53:22,509
(Suspense music)

552
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:29,689
You stay here.
I'm going to town to see who it was.

553
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,020
(Suspense music)

554
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,917
Do not yell.

555
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,566
Where is the?

556
00:54:52,737 --> 00:54:54,099
It came out this morning.

557
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,722
Come on in.

558
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:23,378
Call him.

559
00:55:24,073 --> 00:55:25,730
I already told you that
He's gone.

560
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,153
Good,

561
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:36,660
we will wait for you.

562
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:37,941
(Suspense music)

563
00:56:02,448 --> 00:56:03,653
Who are you looking for?

564
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,820
Come out, I'm unarmed.

565
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,098
Where are Johnny and Slim?

566
00:56:15,203 --> 00:56:16,590
Why do you want to know?

567
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:19,260
Where are they?

568
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,129
Get out before
of losing patience.

569
00:56:23,192 --> 00:56:26,934
Don't make me kill you.
I didn't think he was capable of using a revolver.

570
00:56:31,317 --> 00:56:32,893
Okay, don't be mad.

571
00:56:33,467 --> 00:56:36,551
Johnny went to town
Slim is by the fence.

572
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,220
Must be upon arrival
and bad news awaits you.

573
00:56:39,302 --> 00:56:41,059
I advise you not to try to see him,

574
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,756
it's a bad time.

575
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:47,642
(SHOOT)

576
00:56:50,462 --> 00:56:51,742
(Whinny)

577
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:13,740
Johnny went to town to find out
who killed Davy.

578
00:57:14,676 --> 00:57:15,567
It was you?

579
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:21,567
(Gallop)

580
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,220

581
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,746
(Gallop)

582
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,059
Do you want to know who did it?

583
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:17,114
It was me,

584
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,442
I did not want to do it.

585
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,348
It is you I come looking for.

586
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,285
You deserve an award
for last night's feat.

587
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,620
(SHOOT)

588
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,100
Stay there.

589
00:58:48,864 --> 00:58:50,264
(Gallop)

590
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:58,873
Don't try anything, I would force myself to do
what I don't want.

591
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,200
(SHOOT)

592
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,639
Get out of there, Miriam.

593
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,540
(Shots)

594
01:00:47,795 --> 01:00:48,529
Dan!

595
01:00:50,382 --> 01:00:50,989
Watch out!

596
01:00:51,069 --> 01:00:52,669
(Shots)

597
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:54,700
(SHOUTS)

598
01:01:03,428 --> 01:01:04,451
Dan.

599
01:01:18,728 --> 01:01:20,168
(Music)

600
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:45,420
Andy!

601
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:50,623
Hello Andy!
-Hello!

602
01:01:53,468 --> 01:01:56,099
-Stop that horse,
put him with others.

603
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,756
-Okay, boss.

604
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,968
-Go on, give it more rope.

605
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,593
What are you doing, Andy?

606
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,158
She is learning to gallop.

607
01:02:19,964 --> 01:02:23,882
-What are you going to call him?
-Custer, like my friend's dog.

608
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,789
-It's a pretty name.
Does it obey you?

609
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,195
-I know how to treat horses.

610
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:31,265
-Andy,

611
01:02:32,086 --> 01:02:34,406
in a few days
you will go to school.

612
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,234
-I'm very happy,
so I will learn to write.

613
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:40,703
-Hey, do you know
when will my parents come?

614
01:02:42,141 --> 01:02:45,773
-Soon very soon.

615
01:02:47,522 --> 01:02:48,802
(Suspense music)

616
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:01,343
I hate the rain.

617
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:04,899
I don't understand why once
you told me that without the rain

618
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,101
the man would have lost
part of your happiness.

619
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:11,741
I think there is nothing sadder.

620
01:03:20,986 --> 01:03:22,386
It must be in the barn.

621
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,272
Put something on,
don't go out like that.

622
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:36,771
(Suspense music)

623
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,351
What? Happy now?

624
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,241
What's wrong?

625
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:01,663
What's going to happen to me, nothing.

626
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,338
Let's go Dan
let's go from here.

627
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,210
This house
it is full of memories.

628
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:11,158
Help me Dan
I will do my best because you forget,

629
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,603
but you have to help me.

630
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:15,970
I want the boy and I'll have him
even at the cost of killing Roger.

631
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,322
Bring that bottle!

632
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:24,939
It has you badly used
this shortcut of sheep.

633
01:04:42,556 --> 01:04:43,740
Is there room for me?

634
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,906
Because you are leaving?
Do I have the plague?

635
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,166
Out of here!

636
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:00,752
Do you want to answer me?

637
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:03,978
Is it that I bring the plague?

638
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,700
(Music)

639
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,150
(Whinny)

640
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,423
(DRUNKED) Why are you waiting for me?
You're drilled, Dan.

641
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,169
I'll get you something to dry off.

642
01:06:10,276 --> 01:06:12,432
I am sick of lamentations.

643
01:06:14,628 --> 01:06:15,276
Dan ...

644
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:20,182
Yes, I have drunk. I am wet.
And that!

645
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:25,151
A man has the right to drink
no?

646
01:06:29,511 --> 01:06:31,781
Miriam, you think of yourself.

647
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:34,836
In you and in all your faults.

648
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:38,579
If I'm like this
only you are responsible.

649
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,779
Please, Dan.
Dan, Dan, Dan!

650
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,329
Just once!

651
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:51,204
You know if Andy is not here
It is your fault.

652
01:06:51,285 --> 01:06:54,172
With your tears and ...
Your reasoning.

653
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,649
You have taken it from me!

654
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:59,896
I wouldn't be happy with us
truth?

655
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:04,575
If i just wanted
that I would have come for him.

656
01:07:06,571 --> 01:07:09,011
I swear he didn't take it.

657
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,860
Conversely,
I'm here...

658
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:13,442
shattered.

659
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,410
And you whimpering
because I'm drunk. Drunk.

660
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:19,902
Leave me alone for once!

661
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:22,467
(Sad music)

662
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:05,012
Miriam.

663
01:08:22,522 --> 01:08:23,488
Miriam!

664
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:28,777
Miriam!

665
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:51,767
Have you seen my wife!
Yes, it was this morning.

666
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:55,352
Said something?
No, she just bought a few things.

667
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,419
I remember now.

668
01:08:57,905 --> 01:09:00,105
I think i saw her
at the stage stop.

669
01:09:00,606 --> 01:09:01,389
Thank you.

670
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:12,090
Hey Tom, have you seen my wife?

671
01:09:13,072 --> 01:09:15,592
Yes he left this morning
in the diligence.

672
01:09:16,438 --> 01:09:17,902
Thank you.
You're welcome.

673
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:25,263
Only you can help.

674
01:09:27,013 --> 01:09:29,779
I don't see how or why.
Let him come.

675
01:09:31,045 --> 01:09:32,623
Dan has to see Andy.

676
01:09:32,903 --> 01:09:35,045
There is a law.
If he comes, I'll stop him.

677
01:09:36,107 --> 01:09:37,373
You are the law.

678
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:42,662
Try to understand

679
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,154
Accident or not,
Who can give it back to me?

680
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,201
I quite do
with not stopping you.

681
01:10:00,922 --> 01:10:02,295
You know you could.

682
01:10:07,089 --> 01:10:09,217
You don't feel sorry for anyone, do you?

683
01:10:10,154 --> 01:10:11,834
Now she has her son.

684
01:10:12,025 --> 01:10:14,105
He thinks he has touched the sky
by getting it.

685
01:10:16,015 --> 01:10:17,592
But it will have a punishment.

686
01:10:19,121 --> 01:10:21,521
Mack, take her.

687
01:10:22,419 --> 01:10:24,499
Take her from here
Before I lock her up

688
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,700
-Please, ma'am.
It will have its punishment.

689
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:31,845
Andy can never have him.
Shut up for once!

690
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:33,380
-Let's go.

691
01:10:33,665 --> 01:10:35,825
(Music)

692
01:10:55,414 --> 01:10:56,217
Richard.

693
01:11:01,285 --> 01:11:02,349
-Tell me, sir.

694
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:06,130
-You will have to watch from now
all the entrances of the town.

695
01:11:07,118 --> 01:11:11,118
I'm sure from one moment to another
we will have a visit from Dan Murphy.

696
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,340
(Horse galloping)

697
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,060
What's up, Richard?

698
01:11:35,141 --> 01:11:36,621
-Dan Murphy is coming this way.

699
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,780
-Gather the men quickly.
I wait for you at the ranch.

700
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,500
(Music)

701
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,439
Hey, buddy.

702
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,760
Say.

703
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,463
Don't know where the sheriff is?

704
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:29,815
I can't assure you, but if not
he is here, he will be at his ranch.

705
01:12:29,896 --> 01:12:32,368
Do you know where it is?
Yes thanks.

706
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,391
You're welcome.

707
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,060
(Whinny)

708
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:01,799
Andy.

709
01:13:10,277 --> 01:13:12,317
Go with him,
tomorrow I'll come to see you again.

710
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:14,604
And dad?
As well. He will also come.

711
01:13:18,953 --> 01:13:21,313
Andy, come on.

712
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:23,740
(Music)

713
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,347
Were you looking for me?

714
01:14:50,025 --> 01:14:53,825
I also looked for you a long time.
We are in luck then.

715
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:56,534
You have the opportunity
to settle the account.

716
01:14:56,615 --> 01:14:59,300
Drop your weapons, Dan.
It's advice.

717
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,237
You will have to come and take them off.

718
01:15:01,368 --> 01:15:03,488
I'm warning you
for your own good.

719
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:05,620
This is your last chance.

720
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:08,042
Don't try to face yourself
back to law.

721
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:12,083
You seem very confident.

722
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,409
You were not so much

723
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,925
when you shot at close range
against my son.

724
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:21,472
Now i'm trying
to save your life.

725
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,284
I will end yours
Even if it's the last thing I do.

726
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:30,205
(Suspense music)

727
01:15:58,263 --> 01:15:59,543
Drop the weapons.

728
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:06,340
(Shots)

729
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,540
Andy, don't go out.

730
01:16:29,527 --> 01:16:30,503
-Father!

731
01:16:40,657 --> 01:16:43,457
(SHOUTS)

732
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:46,601
(Music)
