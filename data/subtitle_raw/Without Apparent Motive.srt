1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,800
WITHOUT APPARENT MOTIVE

2
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:18,208
Our story is the adventure of a man
looking for a hidden truth...

3
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:26,490
... and it would be no adventure if it did
not happen to a man fit for adventure.

4
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:37,471
Hello Mr Carella, good to
have you back home again.

5
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,003
Going to the precinct now?

6
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,806
Keep in touch.

7
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:00,879
Anytime you want me to come
up just whistle, alright?

8
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:20,173
Day 1

9
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,133
Please give me a voice
test Mr Sabirnou.

10
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,454
My name is Julien Sabirnou saying
i'm sick of this stupid show.

11
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:32,813
Once more for camera 5.

12
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,962
My name is Julien Sabirnou saying
i'm sick of this stupid show, ok?

13
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:49,521
- Good morning sunshine.
- Hello Julien.

14
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:53,602
You know we ought to use the tip of
your ear as the next mystery object.

15
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,544
Can you imagine
the questions?

16
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,163
Excuse me.

17
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,829
Sandra, if your mother
finds out about this.

18
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:09,027
No, you mustn't
begin preaching.

19
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,104
Will you at least show
up for lunch today?

20
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,194
That's what mother says
to you every morning.

21
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:23,756
My stepfather doesn't
seem to like you.

22
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:25,476
It's an old story.

23
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,982
Was it a woman?

24
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:01,674
I don't see where the banks
would give us trouble,

25
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,465
we can very easily get
a long term mortgage.

26
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,816
Just look at that property,
you won't find anything like it.

27
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,092
As I was saying, I know you
can make an arrangement,

28
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,604
you'll get a loan at the bank,
there won't be any problem.

29
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,819
Here look, I brought the
contract proposals along.

30
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:18,472
You can see that the
actual risk is...

31
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,405
Look out, help me, help me.

32
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,881
Slowly, slowly, watch his head.

33
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:30,301
Carefully.

34
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:10,043
- You heard nothing at all?
- No, he just grabbed his forehead.

35
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,825
- Then he fell against you?
- Yes, so I held onto him.

36
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:14,004
- They must've used a
silencer. - That's very good.

37
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:16,187
You said that he was
reaching for his bag.

38
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,921
Well he was looking
for something.

39
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,825
- Say anything? - He
mentioned some papers.

40
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,099
- What papers? - Here
they are Mr Carella.

41
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,035
Thanks Di Bozzo.

42
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,068
Hey, you two see anyone?

43
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,282
We also found this
inside of his bag.

44
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,145
- Well Doume?
- The cartridge.

45
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,564
22 long rifle, imagine how
many there are in France.

46
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,058
It's not going
to be very easy.

47
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:01,696
Shall I inform the family?

48
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,582
No, you'd better let me,
I already know them all.

49
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:20,481
I think you're missing some
details in the section up there.

50
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,030
- Mr Barroyer.
- Yes.

51
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:23,479
Check the original plan.

52
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,806
For you...

53
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:28,863
- She says it's personal.
- Thanks you very much madam.

54
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:30,360
Hello.

55
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:32,633
Morning, how are you?

56
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:34,603
Your husband?

57
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,601
Tell me.

58
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:38,879
Fine, i'll meet you
at the club then.

59
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,665
I'll be there, I
love you, goodbye.

60
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:48,120
Inspector Carella, has something
about that old business come up again?

61
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,331
No Mlle Forest, that's not
what's brought me here.

62
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,862
It's your stepfather...
i'm afraid he's been killed.

63
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,163
Shot by a sniper.

64
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,702
How horrible for my mother.

65
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,357
When did you see him
for the last time?

66
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:10,958
An hour or so ago, not more.

67
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:14,064
- Where did you see him?
- He drove by the square I...

68
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,374
I was with Julien Sabirnou, where
'The Mystery Object's televised.

69
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,761
- And did he stop to talk?
- Yes.

70
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,602
- What did he say?
- Nothing important.

71
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,911
Now look Mlle Forest, it could
be the last thing he ever said...

72
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:35,937
And that's important.

73
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,696
I don't think he liked my
being with Julien Sabirnou.

74
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,334
Sabirnou, the MC on the show?

75
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:43,456
Is that all?

76
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,394
- Put something on Sandra.
- No not now mother.

77
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,353
Go and change.

78
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,721
You said you'd
finished this case.

79
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,530
It concerns your
husband madam Forest.

80
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:41,510
You're going to need all your
courage my dear madam Forest but...

81
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,593
I want you to know my wife and I
are with you in this terrible ordeal.

82
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,709
Thank you, you're
very kind but...

83
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,394
I am not alone, I can't
talk to you right now.

84
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,737
Had your husband ever
been threatened?

85
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,619
Been threatened... why no.

86
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:05,897
He had no enemies.

87
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:10,736
You must pardon me for
asking madam Forest...

88
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:18,255
- Was your husband faithful?
- What do you mean by that?

89
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:21,910
You feel you knew
everything that concerned him?

90
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,698
My husband had a
character above reproach.

91
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,011
It's really awful.

92
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,416
No, i'm sorry,
I won't disturb her.

93
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:40,636
I'll tell her then, alright.

94
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,360
Not now please.

95
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,739
Thank you so much,
it's very kind.

96
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:18,024
- Was he an admirable man?
- Admired would be more like it.

97
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,084
Why's that?

98
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,377
Does my stepfather's life
interest you that much?

99
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:27,932
Mlle Forest, everyone's private
life makes up part of mine.

100
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:38,935
Get me the records on
the "Andriana Case".

101
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,772
Narcotics, you'll find it there.

102
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:42,440
The one involving the Forest girl.

103
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:45,890
I don't believe there'd be a
connection between the two of those.

104
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:49,319
You're not paid to think...
get me the records.

105
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,800
Why did he carry this around?

106
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,642
Well it helped him when they
study insects in the forest.

107
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,060
It also helps start
fires out there.

108
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:25,795
That's scraping the
bottom of the barrel...

109
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,729
today there are more
important things for us to do.

110
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,661
- Will I see you later? - As
soon as I get rid of my husband.

111
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,539
Look, blood.

112
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:41,895
What happened?

113
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:19,901
This was found in
his trunks rolled up.

114
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:21,293
That so?

115
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:23,179
Think it's normal?

116
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:33,804
Ah no madam, so sorry...

117
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,205
you see the mystery object
cannot be found in your apartment.

118
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,968
- Sorry.
- But thank you for trying.

119
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:40,373
- Your name sir if
you will. - Mr Remi.

120
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:41,963
Mr Remi, now Mr Remi?

121
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:46,299
Mr Sabirnou, can I beat
my wife with the object...

122
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,895
I mean the mystery object?

123
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,405
Beat your wife?
No sir, i'm so sorry.

124
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,257
Same type man, same type wound.

125
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:56,921
And i'll bet the lab
report will be the same.

126
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:05,199
It's some kind of nut of course.

127
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:06,536
So this murderer is after...

128
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:09,800
fellows 40 years old who
are married and have money.

129
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:11,108
Sounds promising.

130
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,795
We're going to have to
investigate their past lives.

131
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,098
- Political pasts?
- Political, sexual, financial.

132
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:20,906
- A stink that'll make in town.
- And all of France possibly.

133
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:24,203
- And I have a great date tonight.
- A little chastity won't hurt you.

134
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:28,072
- Got another?
- Sure.

135
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:31,905
Is that all?

136
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,634
Open the window.

137
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:57,136
No comment please.

138
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,735
Good morning commissioner.

139
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:07,457
- And so what have you?
- Same bullets, same crime.

140
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,926
- That's efficient. - We just
started the investigation sir.

141
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,195
You've nothing else?

142
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,990
Excuse me sir, the
file on Sandra Forest

143
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,518
- Thanks, get me Di Bozzo
at the Forest home. - Yes sir.

144
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,593
I'll take it on this line.

145
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,868
Yes commissioner, I
have two dead bodies.

146
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,151
Amusing.

147
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:34,687
Wait a minute.

148
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:40,413
Political, i'm telling
you it's political.

149
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,631
- Hello.
- Two interesting facts...

150
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,993
One, Forest and Barroyer
didn't know each other...

151
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,922
Two, madam Forest had
an appointment with...

152
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,714
her astrologer at
the time of the murder.

153
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:51,324
A certain Hans Kleinberg.

154
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,487
- Hans what?
- Kleinberg.

155
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,762
Do me a favour, check all
the leftist organisations.

156
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:02,683
Just like they're doing to me.

157
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:05,069
I see the basic technique:

158
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,893
Terrorise the middle classes,
spread hysteria and then...

159
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,157
Grab the government.

160
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,637
Maybe the CIA's behind all
this, or it might be NATO.

161
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:18,415
How can you overlook them?

162
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:21,511
Let's try to talk seriously
about this commissioner.

163
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,220
I'm asking if you'll be
serious now... Mr Carella.

164
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:32,813
Who introduced you
to this Kleinberg?

165
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:34,743
My husband.

166
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:37,943
Your husband was
interested in astrology?

167
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:42,719
No, he did have some
business with him though.

168
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,018
Did you know that
Forest belonged to...

169
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:33,766
an organisation of super-militants
during the war in Algeria?

170
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:36,357
And Barroyer...?

171
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,214
When he was 18 years old he was
known as a card carrying communist.

172
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:43,129
And 4 years later you know
what they threw him out for?

173
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:44,800
For beating up
the cell commander.

174
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,362
What does that prove?

175
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:52,259
In my youth I was a devout anarchist,
I couldn't stand the establishment.

176
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:58,228
Forest and Barroyer didn't
know each other maybe however...

177
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,192
between us both there was
something connecting them.

178
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:06,511
- It's confidential.
- What have you learned?

179
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,469
They secretly held bank
accounts in Switzerland.

180
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:15,180
Well if you want to swap secrets
here's a good one commissioner...

181
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:18,455
I would say about half the
middle class here in Nice...

182
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:21,172
maintain secret bank
accounts in Switzerland.

183
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,665
Well then i'll give you a
further tip Mr Carella.

184
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:31,167
As a personal favour,
I must insist on that...

185
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:36,263
I know who smuggles the funds, i'd
say his job's somewhat unorthodox...

186
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,668
let me say, he's able to
tell someone's fortune...

187
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,784
but simultaneously
he's able to bank it.

188
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:45,939
- Kleinberg the astrologer?
- Correct.

189
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:33,336
Try to relax.

190
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:36,932
The influence Saturn has, though
understand it's neither significant...

191
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:40,028
nor of much importance to your
astral plane, can hardly do...

192
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:47,116
You don't seem to
really... be in tune.

193
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,209
Let's forget about
Saturn shall we?

194
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:06,403
I'd be much more
interested if you'd tell me...

195
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,821
how you got money from Mr Forest
and Mr Barroyer into Switzerland.

196
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:19,765
It's a one man operation,
Switzerland is my country.

197
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,758
And let's face it, I
only did it to help.

198
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:26,500
If I hadn't agreed they would have
both asked somebody else inspector.

199
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,095
Excuse me.

200
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:34,291
Mr Di Bozzo my assistant, Mr Kleinberg
the well known Swiss astrologer.

201
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:42,059
Up here you're a
beautiful target.

202
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:51,401
- Sir.
- We'll be in touch.

203
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:57,549
And now a very charming
and lovely contestant.

204
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,906
Alright Mlle, do you have any
idea what the mystery object is?

205
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,636
Go on Mlle, speak up.

206
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:16,317
DOUBLE MURDER MYSTERY

207
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:24,151
Drop everything, we'll
concentrate on this exclusive.

208
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,152
- Get me a line to Paris.
- Right away.

209
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,411
- Think it's political this story?
- It could be an old score.

210
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,605
That's absurd, the mafia
doesn't exist here in France.

211
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:56,397
And Carella the detective,
is he well known?

212
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,211
He certainly is.

213
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,159
I know he's one of the best
marksmen they ever had in the force.

214
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,096
And another thing...

215
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:04,918
he's the one responsible for breaking up
that "Andriani" traffic and dope ring.

216
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:06,036
But didn't that
stepdaughter of Forest...

217
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:08,191
turn out to be mixed
up in the Adriani ring?

218
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,613
Mixed up, that's
one way to put it.

219
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,467
In fact, she was the one who
turned them in to detective Carella.

220
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:13,761
Oh wow.

221
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,510
Would a rifle with a
scope be listed here?

222
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,814
Sorry, there are only
pistol sales on file.

223
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:44,948
Great.

224
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:48,714
Thanks.

225
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:55,719
- Mr Carella.
- Yes.

226
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,024
Hurry over, there's a
prowler out in the garden.

227
00:26:58,024 --> 00:26:59,661
- Where's your mother?
- In her room.

228
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,137
Lock all the doors,
i'll be right over.

229
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,077
- Come out or i'll shoot.
- Don't be an idiot.

230
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,740
And when I think of how much
my mother thought of him.

231
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:56,688
You don't know the things
that can be found when...

232
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,557
you dig into someone's
life like this.

233
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,040
- What's going on? - Nothing
mother, go back to bed.

234
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,221
Hello.

235
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:32,589
- Hello, who is it? - Hello
Jocelyne, how are you?

236
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:35,270
I can't believe it, Carella.

237
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:37,912
What happened,
changed your mind?

238
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,560
I wondered how
you'd been doing.

239
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,136
- Are you free tomorrow?
- Where?

240
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,282
- My place. - Alright, i'll be there.

241
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:53,685
- Will you buy me lunch?
- Sure, till tomorrow, bye.

242
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,597
Let me hang onto this.

243
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,560
Day 2

244
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:33,919
I hope you won't
be upset Sandra but...

245
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,636
for the time being I think
we'd better not be seen together.

246
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:38,814
I won't be upset.

247
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:16,661
My future son-in-law is definitely
Aquarius and my daughter is Taurus.

248
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,691
I found out my future son-in-law's
mother is Aries, imagine!

249
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:24,267
Only I have been unable to find out
exactly when his father was born.

250
00:30:25,603 --> 00:30:29,706
Well, the only thing I can
possibly tell you now madam is...

251
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:36,509
to me, your astral signs are
confused, most complicated...

252
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,740
but you know I told
you that last month.

253
00:30:40,494 --> 00:30:43,712
I believe you also said you'd
be helpful predicting the future.

254
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,329
Oh no no, never, i'm sorry.

255
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:06,203
Help!

256
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:37,531
Come on, help me.

257
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:31,875
It's impossible for us to put
men on every rooftop in the city.

258
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,778
We're getting reinforcements
from Cannes and Marseilles.

259
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:35,786
An investigative committee is
already on it's way to Geneva.

260
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,067
It's Paris sir.

261
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,422
Ah, the ministry, before long
they'll be here, you'll see.

262
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:42,496
Right.

263
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:45,893
Police headquarters
can I help you?

264
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:51,328
Family, friends, contacts, employees,
mistresses, buddies in the army...

265
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:54,033
We have to check out everyone who
knew Forest, Barroyer or Kleinberg.

266
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:57,334
- It's in their past i'm sure.
- We don't have enough men.

267
00:32:57,578 --> 00:33:00,304
Like hell, in 24 hours we'll
have half the French force here.

268
00:33:22,471 --> 00:33:25,513
Jocelyne i'm leaving for lunch now.

269
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:28,209
You'll lock everything up won't you?

270
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:29,841
See you later.

271
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:31,861
Bon appetit doctor.

272
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:44,982
Yes.

273
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:47,496
Right.

274
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:52,777
Better check it out.

275
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,642
It's nice you called
me, I was surprised.

276
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:08,682
I thought perhaps
everything had ended.

277
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,492
That i'd lost my appeal.

278
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:15,285
Physically speaking of course.

279
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:23,286
It's a difficult matter to
let go a lovely young lady...

280
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:26,034
with whom you've tried
to live for 2 years.

281
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,609
I'm flattered.

282
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:43,117
Did you know Tony Forest?

283
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,002
Dirty rat!

284
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,779
- That's what made you
call me up. - Yes.

285
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:58,859
Did you know him?

286
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:03,562
The fact is until I knew
you there were other men...

287
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,149
and among them I must
admit I knew Tony Forest.

288
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:11,640
And how do you explain your name
written in red in his notebook?

289
00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:24,555
- And have you seen him
lately. - It's about a week.

290
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:27,021
Why?

291
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:31,705
You're pushing me.

292
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,837
Did Tony Forest say anything to you
that could be of interest to me?

293
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,816
Yes...

294
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:55,887
That he loved me.

295
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:23,268
And Barroyer, did you know him?

296
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:28,989
In case you're asking me, no,
I never had an affair with him.

297
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:35,499
What do you think? That I
cast a spell on the two of them?

298
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,449
But you did know them.

299
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:40,393
So I knew them, that
doesn't make it a crime.

300
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:43,640
Barroyer I knew
at the university.

301
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:46,887
Tony Forest went there also.

302
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:05,504
I was studying medicine.

303
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:13,566
Kleinberg, did he
study there too?

304
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,520
The fact is I came here
today for one reason...

305
00:39:24,674 --> 00:39:27,328
I foolishly thought you'd changed
your mind since our vacation.

306
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:30,105
I wasn't expecting
the third degree.

307
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:58,358
- You mentioned Kleinberg?
- Yes, mean anything to you?

308
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:06,092
Jocelyne, was he also with
you at the university?

309
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:08,690
Let go Carella,
please leave me alone.

310
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:12,089
In 48 hours, i've had no clue to
give me a motive for these 3 murders.

311
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,171
Kleinberg.

312
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:22,074
Come on, we'd better
talk about it quietly.

313
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:25,658
Have a drink.
Whisky? Martini?

314
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,327
Mr Carella, could I possibly
do something for you?

315
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:02,512
Yes, call the police and tell
them to block off the area.

316
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:04,080
Right away.

317
00:45:44,312 --> 00:45:48,289
- You knew this woman?
- For some time.

318
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:51,986
- She'd just left you?
- Yes.

319
00:45:53,036 --> 00:45:56,618
- Did she know anything
we could use? - The proof!

320
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:19,006
Looks as though he missed
her first time around.

321
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:25,749
- You say you never heard
any shooting. - No.

322
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,150
He apparently readjusted his
sights while she was with you.

323
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,234
Meaning what
i'd like to know?

324
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,213
- Oh you're upset.
- Of course i'm upset.

325
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,287
If I should get the first shot
I guarantee I won't miss him.

326
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:46,077
May I know why you
asked her to come here?

327
00:47:03,224 --> 00:47:05,685
- What are you doing?
- Have you noticed?

328
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,692
They were all killed in or
near the same neighbourhood.

329
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:16,845
- We'll leave you alone.
- No, that's alright.

330
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,448
You we're asking me a question.

331
00:47:22,528 --> 00:47:25,130
I wanted to know your reason
for asking her to come here.

332
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:28,825
- She was listed in
Forest's diary. - His diary?

333
00:47:29,342 --> 00:47:30,492
Yes, his diary in
which he wrote...

334
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:32,847
the names and phones of
all the girls he knew.

335
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:36,030
- He also grades them.
- And what grade did she get?

336
00:47:36,268 --> 00:47:37,743
It's a damn good grade!

337
00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:46,844
We've got to verify
all those addresses.

338
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:49,650
Investigate every woman there.

339
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,249
That might well be the first clue
we have to connect the victims.

340
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:57,513
We have to go back to Forest again,
we have to push his wife some more.

341
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:00,842
And talk with his
stepdaughter Sandra.

342
00:48:01,196 --> 00:48:02,339
Come on, let's get to work.

343
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,994
Look, it's very serious,
it'd be hard for me to explain.

344
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,427
I'm next on the list.

345
00:48:47,037 --> 00:48:48,721
How are you involved
in this business?

346
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:51,233
I'm deeply involved
in the whole story.

347
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,975
- They'd never make an attempt
on a person like you. - Sorry?

348
00:48:56,957 --> 00:48:58,454
What does that mean?

349
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,385
When you know the truth you'll discover
the others happen to be just as bad.

350
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,180
And what's stopping you
from going to the police?

351
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,137
No Mlle, leave me alone,
i've signed enough.

352
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:18,375
Listen, it's possibly to warn the
police so i'm not compromised.

353
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:21,823
You'll have to help me. Are you
prepared to commit robbery?

354
00:49:22,224 --> 00:49:24,067
What is it you want?

355
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:33,836
Day 3

356
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:25,495
And now the news

357
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:28,589
The whole nation is watching Nice
after the mad sniper's 4th murder.

358
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:31,352
It was learned this morning that
Mlle Jocelyne Rocca was...

359
00:53:31,352 --> 00:53:35,126
shot down as she was walking out
of police inpsector Carella's home.

360
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,269
It appears she went there
of her own free well to...

361
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:40,225
volunteer information
concering the mysterious killer.

362
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:42,171
Could the police
have found a lead?

363
00:53:42,405 --> 00:53:44,870
Let's hope so because since
yesterday the town of Nice is...

364
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:48,051
living in terror wondering who
the sniper will chose next.

365
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:54,297
- What about the Forest girl?
- Busy rehearsing.

366
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:56,431
She has a part in a
play they're giving at...

367
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:58,382
the university,
the director is Palombo.

368
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,738
He's the drama coach there.

369
00:54:01,787 --> 00:54:02,375
Let's go.

370
00:54:03,517 --> 00:54:05,729
That's the 2nd time in 24 hours
someone's mentioned that university.

371
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:07,897
The first person was
Jocelyne yesterday.

372
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:12,110
It's where she knew Tony Forest,
Barroyer and our astrologer Kleinberg.

373
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:14,965
And today Sandra Forest
is supposed to be there.

374
00:54:15,433 --> 00:54:16,883
It's interesting huh?

375
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:20,050
- Where's Doume?
- He stayed back at the precinct.

376
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:24,683
Mr Carella... may I sak you why
you keep washing your hands?

377
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,856
Sure, you may ask me about it.

378
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:38,809
So you will leave and
I will remember you.

379
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:42,333
Remember you, why should
memory bring such sadness?

380
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:44,497
- No stop.
- It's hard for me.

381
00:54:44,903 --> 00:54:47,710
Shall we begin again?
It's not so bad but...

382
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:51,798
- Sandra, what is it?
- I'm not sure.

383
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:55,826
You're so uptight,
it's as if... well...

384
00:54:56,028 --> 00:54:58,445
- Shall we begin again? - Oh
yes, there's time to begin again.

385
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:00,519
We're here to rehearse.

386
00:55:06,777 --> 00:55:09,961
- Who wrote this play?
- The old phoney directing it.

387
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,246
- Is it a melodrama?
- No, a crapodrama!

388
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,189
Ok everyone, from the beginning.

389
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:29,430
- How about the title? - Doesn't
much matter he changes it so often.

390
00:55:29,718 --> 00:55:30,786
What do you mean?

391
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:34,030
Palombo decided this time
the title would be Sandra but...

392
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,855
when he first did it way back,
some 8 or 10 years ago...

393
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,471
he called the play Juliette.

394
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,381
Juliette.

395
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:46,155
Juliette.

396
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:58,409
Juliette my darling, isn't it
time you went to the police?

397
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,195
They'd be interested
in what you have to say.

398
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,758
- Did you ever know Tony Forest?
- Yes I knew Tony Forest.

399
00:56:43,676 --> 00:56:46,982
But as for the rest, it'd be
difficult to remember because...

400
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:52,046
i've had so many ex-students been
involved in my cultural studies.

401
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:54,697
Good morning gentlemen.

402
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:57,708
Mr Palombo, will you
need me any more today?

403
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:00,048
No, you may go Mlle Forest.

404
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,401
What courage she has.

405
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:06,402
She must've been
really upset after...

406
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:09,034
what happened but she agreed
to come over and rehearse.

407
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:12,966
Mr Palombo, we've been looking for
any possible clue in this affair.

408
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:15,633
If you know anything at all
now's the time to speak up.

409
00:57:16,748 --> 00:57:19,518
But why, why me? What could...

410
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,199
Did you ever know... did
you ever know Jocelyne Rocca?

411
00:57:25,856 --> 00:57:28,147
- Did you know her?
- Yes I knew her.

412
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:34,884
- And Hans Kleinberg, Kleinberg?
- Kleinberg, yes I knew both of them.

413
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,381
I'm going to ask you to come down
to police headquarters with us.

414
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,025
You'll have to rehearse the play
without me for the time being.

415
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,062
- I have to get my jacket.
- Go ahead, please.

416
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:54,582
Take him in, don't wait for me.

417
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:27,089
- What if I took you in?
- For what?

418
00:59:28,508 --> 00:59:31,171
For illegally entering a
municipal building, robbery.

419
00:59:37,252 --> 00:59:39,532
Who asked you to come here
and ransack this room?

420
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,672
Now look here Mlle Forest...

421
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:54,772
Just remember it wouldn't be the
first time you gave us a heads up.

422
00:59:56,082 --> 00:59:57,663
I promised I
wouldn't say anything.

423
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,078
Promised someone
on TV possibly?

424
01:00:01,618 --> 01:00:02,606
Possibly.

425
01:00:21,671 --> 01:00:24,792
- Do you know the time for
that TV show? - About noon.

426
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:38,326
- Doume. - Ah yes I know
that voice, it's Carella.

427
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,728
- Yes. - Carella, you'd better take a motorcycle...

428
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,975
with the traffic at noon you can't
make it in time going in a car.

429
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,939
Go by motorcycle to
La Place Rossanti...

430
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:48,295
where they do 'The Mystery
Object' TV show, understand?

431
01:00:48,907 --> 01:00:51,407
Do everything you can to get
there and protect Sabirnou.

432
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,412
- Know who that is?
- Yes, he's the MC.

433
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:55,507
- That's it.
- Protect Sabirnou...

434
01:00:55,507 --> 01:00:57,862
even if you're shot in his
place, he must be protected.

435
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,733
- That's your assignment,
understand? - Why?

436
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:01,506
- Because he's next on
the list. - What list?

437
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:05,081
Hurry you fool, no hold on,
you'd better tell Di Bozzo...

438
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:07,607
it's very important he blocks
off the area as fast as he can.

439
01:01:07,816 --> 01:01:08,216
Go!

440
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,954
You're always turning
up aren't you?

441
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,719
- Do you have idea who the
murderer might be? - No.

442
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:42,312
We'll stop the show for now.

443
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,649
Remember 'The Mystery Object Show'
is temporarily cancelled.

444
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:48,581
And now to remind
you of the clues:

445
01:01:49,267 --> 01:01:52,173
The mystery object is
quite small, round...

446
01:01:52,844 --> 01:01:54,439
it's something you can
purchase in a store...

447
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,942
and it's always
sombre in colour, sir.

448
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:04,295
Mr Sabirnou, the mystery object,
is it the black barrel of a rifle...

449
01:02:04,295 --> 01:02:06,302
with which our unknown
friend means to kill us all?

450
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,460
Come now, let's try to
stick to the game sir.

451
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,093
We are very sorry for
the temporary interruption.

452
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:32,381
Let's have your papers.

453
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:08,853
Excuse me, could I please
have your attention.

454
01:04:09,873 --> 01:04:15,713
Your honour, commissioner, assistant
commisioner, colonel, sir, Mlle.

455
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:19,488
This is the programme of
a play performed at...

456
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:22,790
the university of Nice's
cultural centre 8 years ago.

457
01:04:24,246 --> 01:04:25,947
The first four amateur actors:

458
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:35,959
Antoine Forest, Pierre Barroyer,
Hans Kleinberg and Jocelyne Rocca...

459
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,709
Have all been murdered in the
order of their stage appearance...

460
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:42,449
which is, as you can see, how
they're listed in the programme.

461
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:47,928
It is therefore obvious that the fifth
victim should've been Julien Sabirnou.

462
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,754
He is now in protective
custody in this building.

463
01:04:52,842 --> 01:04:55,759
Francis Palombo, who
wrote Juliette...

464
01:04:56,603 --> 01:05:00,887
a somewhat innocuous work, a melodrama,
I spent a few hours reading it...

465
01:05:02,509 --> 01:05:07,236
Francis Palombo is also here
undergoing interrogation.

466
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:10,837
As to the two other
persons on the program...

467
01:05:11,072 --> 01:05:14,929
H�l�ne Vall�e and Juliette Vaudreuil,
we've begun a search to locate them.

468
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:20,544
The point is why, after
8 years have past...

469
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:24,498
does professor Palmobo suddenly
decide to revive his play?

470
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:28,490
This is the point on which Mr
Palombo is now being questioned...

471
01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:30,534
and it's not been
answered satisfactorily.

472
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,496
In any case, there clearly
exists between these 8 people...

473
01:05:34,703 --> 01:05:38,365
some event or events which has caused
someone to take this course of murder.

474
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,427
The two women could be
somewhat difficult to find.

475
01:05:43,688 --> 01:05:45,207
The chances are they're
both now married...

476
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,387
and no longer living
under their maiden names.

477
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,901
However, we've sent
out search notices.

478
01:06:52,023 --> 01:06:54,517
Don't underestimate the Paris police,
they're quite efficient you know.

479
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:56,716
I've every confidence
in Carella, excuse me.

480
01:06:57,965 --> 01:07:00,106
Look, we already have four
corpses on our hands...

481
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,130
we can't afford
any more mistakes.

482
01:07:03,617 --> 01:07:07,062
Carella, you're not making this
personal on account of Mlle Rocca?

483
01:07:10,963 --> 01:07:11,917
Where are you going?

484
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,639
I'm going to see the parents
of Juliette Vaudreuil...

485
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,705
Di Boozo found out where they are.

486
01:07:17,754 --> 01:07:22,320
Use the lead "Inspector Carella states
the murderer won't kill any more."

487
01:07:23,324 --> 01:07:26,674
Yes, end quote, make
that the headline.

488
01:07:31,884 --> 01:07:33,522
- Inspector Carella?
- Madam.

489
01:07:34,368 --> 01:07:35,331
Helene Dumont.

490
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:38,160
- Excuse me I have to hurry.
- Helenee Dumont nnamed Vallee.

491
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:40,948
Helene Vallee.

492
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:49,374
What made you come to see me
Madam Vallee er Madam Dumont?

493
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,304
Don't you think he means to kill
everyone who was in that play?

494
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,526
- You know who the
killer is? - No.

495
01:07:58,689 --> 01:07:59,999
I'm sorry inspector.

496
01:08:03,899 --> 01:08:05,833
What have you been doing
all this time Madam Dumont?

497
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,627
Staying in St Tropez.

498
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:11,885
- And you got frightened I suppose?
- It frightened me yes...

499
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:14,366
I told my husband someone
certainly seems to be...

500
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:16,626
trying to kill everyone
who was in Juliette.

501
01:08:17,377 --> 01:08:19,045
And what did your
husband say about it?

502
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,589
He seemed to think
I must be a fool.

503
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:27,085
His opinion was i'd be bothering
the police and you'd refuse to listen.

504
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,812
You did well to come
here Madam Dumont.

505
01:08:30,828 --> 01:08:32,608
- Will you come with me?
- Alright.

506
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:35,823
You drive.

507
01:08:40,462 --> 01:08:42,568
Wouldn't it be safer to put her
under protection with the others?

508
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:44,278
Sit in front.

509
01:08:46,385 --> 01:08:48,770
Would it really bother you to answer
one of my questions just once?

510
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:54,228
You did the play and when
the performance was over...

511
01:08:54,228 --> 01:08:55,995
you all went to have a
drink at Mr Palmobo's home.

512
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:59,220
That's right, as I remember
we got a bit drunk.

513
01:08:59,564 --> 01:09:04,354
- Was Juliette Vaudreuil there?
- Oh yes, all of the girls were there.

514
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:09,508
Do you know if Juliette got married
since then or what's become of her?

515
01:09:10,504 --> 01:09:11,531
No idea.

516
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,407
- Everybody have fun at
the party? - I'd imagine.

517
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:26,804
We all stayed there
the whole night...

518
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,612
but Palombo was tired and went
to bed early in the evening.

519
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,808
And did anything in
particular happen that night?

520
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:40,536
- We made love.
- Who exactly is we?

521
01:09:43,258 --> 01:09:44,179
Everyone.

522
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:57,673
But did it begin...
naturally Madam Dumont?

523
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,894
I mean didn't
anyone even flirt?

524
01:10:02,187 --> 01:10:07,174
With one exception I believe we had
all been intimate, but not in a group.

525
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,532
- And so?
- And so...

526
01:10:13,259 --> 01:10:18,705
And so there were two to begin
and two more and then six.

527
01:10:25,848 --> 01:10:27,945
Did you see each
other after the party?

528
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:35,349
We kept acquaintances, that is
of course not including Juliette.

529
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:37,335
It hadn't been
pleasant for her...

530
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:39,905
so we thought she'd most
probably drop out because...

531
01:10:41,335 --> 01:10:42,652
they forced her
to drink so much.

532
01:10:42,857 --> 01:10:44,429
- Who's they?
- The guys.

533
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:51,179
- And the boys forced her.
- Forced or raped?

534
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:54,227
- Raped.
- You too?

535
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,004
Me? No, nobody raped me.

536
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:03,074
- And what were you doing?
- Nothing.

537
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:05,835
I watched it.

538
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:37,378
Helene Vallee made a confession
about your little orgy.

539
01:11:39,623 --> 01:11:41,329
What stopped you
telling me about it?

540
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,576
It's something one
doesn't care to discuss.

541
01:11:47,629 --> 01:11:48,799
I've tried to
forget what happened...

542
01:11:50,981 --> 01:11:55,344
But it haunts me...
i'm sick about it.

543
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:58,339
You were ashamed so you
had to get rid of them.

544
01:11:59,433 --> 01:12:01,400
You were afraid the whole world
would find out your secrets so...

545
01:12:02,196 --> 01:12:03,644
the witnesses had
to be eliminated.

546
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:07,449
You're a fool.
I didn't murder anyone.

547
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:10,431
I'm not capable, I
couldn't pull the trigger.

548
01:12:10,431 --> 01:12:14,186
We found a gun at your bedside and
you couldn't fire a gun you say.

549
01:12:14,714 --> 01:12:16,652
- I'm just a collecter.
- It had shells in it.

550
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:19,275
You kept it on your
night table, why?

551
01:12:20,177 --> 01:12:21,266
- Go on.
- For protection.

552
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:23,263
- You know who did it? - No, really.

553
01:12:24,635 --> 01:12:29,534
It was only after Forest and Barroyer
were murdered that I began to think...

554
01:12:30,954 --> 01:12:34,650
and then there was Kleinberg
and I knew what it meant.

555
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:36,741
You should've come here sooner
for you own protection.

556
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:41,492
I suppose so, but there
was a scandal, my career...

557
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:44,581
You preferred worrying about your career
and not about getting yourself murdered?

558
01:13:23,879 --> 01:13:26,406
After 8 years you decide to
perform your play again...

559
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:32,830
you get Forest's stepdaughter
to play the lead... why?

560
01:13:34,514 --> 01:13:38,259
It's a coincidence, accident.

561
01:13:40,759 --> 01:13:44,170
And is this a coincidence? We
found this photo in your apartment.

562
01:13:44,576 --> 01:13:45,855
Do you recognise her?

563
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:50,793
Oh yes, it's Juliette Vaudreuil.

564
01:13:52,744 --> 01:13:55,847
And this is Sandra Forest, don't
you think there's a resemblence?

565
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:02,009
When I saw Sandra Forest in the
library I couldn't believe it.

566
01:14:03,517 --> 01:14:05,478
I'd written the
play for Juliette.

567
01:14:08,808 --> 01:14:15,664
I loved Juliette, in a platonic
way, but after that night...

568
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:20,844
I swore i'd never perform
that silly play again but...

569
01:14:23,449 --> 01:14:25,601
seeing Sandra was
just too much for me.

570
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:30,222
Mr Palombo, 3 questions:

571
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:35,697
Do you think there's
a connection between...

572
01:14:35,697 --> 01:14:37,943
these murders and the
reproduction of your play?

573
01:14:40,139 --> 01:14:43,388
If not please explain why nothing of
this sort happened before this year.

574
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:51,692
Is Juliette Vaudreuil
capable of shooting a gun?

575
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:56,186
Don't ask me.

576
01:14:56,746 --> 01:15:00,629
Once before this she put
herself under a long treatment.

577
01:15:01,405 --> 01:15:03,213
I'm the one who told
her to go to the clinic.

578
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:04,495
Yes, we know.

579
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:07,556
Very upset, suffered a
somatic trauma I believe.

580
01:15:07,556 --> 01:15:09,277
Yes, it was somatic
and psychological.

581
01:18:47,552 --> 01:18:52,733
Juliette my darling, i'm awfully
sorry to have to insist but...

582
01:18:53,059 --> 01:18:55,951
I do think it would be
best to go to the police.

583
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:00,969
Yes Juliette.

584
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:06,251
You're in grave danger darling and
i'm certain they'd be interested.

585
01:19:08,769 --> 01:19:10,844
They'd expect me
to tell and I can't.

586
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:16,008
Well, you won't tell
them a single thing.

587
01:19:25,745 --> 01:19:32,202
- But they'll protect you. - But I
don't go anywhere, there's no risk.

588
01:20:41,146 --> 01:20:42,407
You go out seldom but...

589
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:47,630
there's still a chance the
murderer will seek you out.

590
01:20:49,799 --> 01:20:52,170
They couldn't really hurt
me because you'd be there.

591
01:20:55,156 --> 01:20:56,437
Perry?

592
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:00,369
You're right.

593
01:21:02,486 --> 01:21:03,830
Yes of course.

594
01:21:07,181 --> 01:21:08,585
I'd protect you.

595
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:19,155
Day 4

596
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,646
Reporters, photographers
and curious onlookers...

597
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:16,687
waited on for hours in vain in front
of Nice police headquarters last night.

598
01:22:16,938 --> 01:22:19,094
No new clues or information
have been reported...

599
01:22:19,094 --> 01:22:22,884
after a long night of interrogations
by inspector Carella and his men.

600
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:25,525
This morning, Nice waits
out this horror of blood...

601
01:22:25,813 --> 01:22:28,379
continuing to ask
unanswered questions.

602
01:22:33,124 --> 01:22:35,882
- That new stuff?
- No, just routine.

603
01:22:41,402 --> 01:22:43,467
It's a homicide report
from the Saint-Jouin police.

604
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:46,161
The body of an old man.

605
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:50,093
He was a street cleaner found
on a jetty near the main harbour.

606
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:53,154
Ok, see if you can get
me more details on it.

607
01:22:54,755 --> 01:22:56,692
At the moment, all
dead bodies interest me.

608
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:09,499
It's nothing but
a poor old man.

609
01:23:09,844 --> 01:23:10,824
It appears he'd
been strangled.

610
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:13,837
The doctor set the time at
about 4 yesterday afternoon.

611
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:17,034
No trace of any sort
of long rifle, nothing.

612
01:23:17,503 --> 01:23:19,409
The man couldn't have
anything to do with our case.

613
01:23:19,764 --> 01:23:23,594
Your suspects are here now, are
you ready to interrogate them?

614
01:23:24,443 --> 01:23:26,009
Good morning to you sir.

615
01:23:26,678 --> 01:23:29,025
Oh pardon me Carella, I
meant to say good morning.

616
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,480
Why should anyone have
killed a poor old man?

617
01:23:32,495 --> 01:23:34,508
What if he was a
witness to something?

618
01:23:34,741 --> 01:23:36,224
There is a theory...

619
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:41,324
but you have 3 witnesses to
question and that's not just theory.

620
01:23:41,607 --> 01:23:45,432
Palombo's the only one who interests
me, none of his arguments hold up.

621
01:23:45,638 --> 01:23:46,894
Well begin with him then.

622
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:51,093
I thought you were able
to make anybody talk.

623
01:23:57,067 --> 01:23:59,860
Nevertheless maybe we ought to have
something more on this new murder.

624
01:24:00,142 --> 01:24:02,370
Would you please connect
me with inspector Carella.

625
01:24:03,384 --> 01:24:05,522
Oh no we don't know
each other at all.

626
01:24:14,273 --> 01:24:17,973
My name's Perry Rupert-Foote,
i'm a British subject...

627
01:24:19,209 --> 01:24:21,436
and i'm also married
to Juliette Vaudreuil.

628
01:24:26,369 --> 01:24:28,129
She needs protection i'm afraid.

629
01:24:29,507 --> 01:24:31,358
Right, that's it.

630
01:24:32,593 --> 01:24:34,634
Oh no she'd never leave,
can't you come?

631
01:24:37,563 --> 01:24:42,626
It's the Hotel Regina, Parc Signere,
apartment 296, use the stairs.

632
01:24:44,387 --> 01:24:48,111
Inspector, one last thing, one
should be very gentle with my wife.

633
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:52,838
She's very fragile.

634
01:25:22,996 --> 01:25:26,414
My wife will be with
you in just a second.

635
01:25:28,821 --> 01:25:30,797
- May I please wash
my hands? - Of course.

636
01:25:31,348 --> 01:25:32,389
There.

637
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,670
- May I?
- Please do.

638
01:26:44,048 --> 01:26:44,942
Sir...

639
01:26:46,482 --> 01:26:48,244
You will look after her?

640
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:54,311
Count on me Mr Rupert-Foote, we
will look after her extremely well.

641
01:28:03,058 --> 01:28:04,099
Stop here Doume.

642
01:28:36,048 --> 01:28:39,097
May I ask how long it's been since
you made love to your husband madam?

643
01:28:51,922 --> 01:28:54,054
Or maybe you two have
never made love at all.

644
01:28:56,602 --> 01:29:01,074
But he worships you so
he wanted to avenge you.

645
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:06,927
He wanted to wash away the
insult, wash away the stain.

646
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:10,062
So he started to
get rid of them...

647
01:29:10,754 --> 01:29:15,491
one after the other, with
or without your approval.

648
01:29:18,471 --> 01:29:20,825
But you were aware of
something weren't you?

649
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:24,043
You must've suspected something.

650
01:29:30,817 --> 01:29:33,672
Well am I on the right
track madam Rupert-Foote?

651
01:29:34,197 --> 01:29:36,945
I asked you am I on the right
track madam Rupert-Foote?

652
01:29:39,344 --> 01:29:40,933
You can't make me stay here.

653
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:50,767
- Here, this will save my going back.
- I was hoping you wouldn't leave it.

654
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:55,483
For you the case is a success,
for me it's been a disaster.

655
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,170
I couldn't return.

656
01:33:57,826 --> 01:34:03,119
Carella, look at this, this is what
we found in the streets we scoured.

657
01:34:03,785 --> 01:34:07,343
Juliette's husband was the one
who strangled him, you were right.

658
01:34:07,991 --> 01:34:11,227
Well, doesn't that make you
feel like staying with us?

659
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:14,644
Goodbye sir.
