1
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,590
- Master, are you all right?
- Yes.

2
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,093
I'm all right. I'm
lucky to still be alive.

3
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,132
We must get our Master Chen
to go into hiding at once.

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,604
Master, you'd better try and run.

5
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,642
Master, take care of
your leg. We'll cover you.

6
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,146
- Right. Be careful.
- Let's go.

7
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,173
Father. Take care.

8
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,175
Hey!

9
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,195
Yen Ting Hua, running dog of the Ching,

10
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,198
You should be ashamed
of your evil deeds.

11
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,201
- You bastard!
- Shut up!

12
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,203
I respect you, Chien Huan Li,

13
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:03,671
Because you are a brave man.

14
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:07,710
If only you will tell
me where Chen is hiding,

15
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:10,713
I will spare your life and reward you.

16
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,715
Stop it.

17
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm one of the Sien Yi clan,
founded by our great hero Hiu Fei.

18
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,187
I'm no betrayer.

19
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,475
I wouldn't have anything
to do with you, you bastard.

20
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,728
You have created some evil
ways to terrorize our people,

21
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:28,731
And even if it costs me my life,

22
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,733
I will challenge you.

23
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,237
I advise you to think it over.

24
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:36,739
I want your life!

25
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,256
Huh! So, we'll see about that.

26
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,323
Now tell me where Chen is.

27
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,326
Haah!

28
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,821
We've just moved here,

29
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,358
And already you're causing trouble.

30
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:38,878
What have I been teaching you?

31
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,329
Study, and act with thought.

32
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,617
- What else?
- Train hard, to help others.

33
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,870
- Have you trained today?
- Not yet.

34
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:50,373
Grandpa, shall I start now?

35
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,375
Go ahead.

36
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,857
Finished.

37
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,895
It was much too quick.

38
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,863
I couldn't see it clearly.

39
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,401
I'm getting old, and my sight is going.

40
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,903
Once more, and slowly this time.

41
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,905
Oh.

42
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,412
Well, what is this?

43
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,379
Footwork

44
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,417
It looks all right, but not very steady.

45
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,919
Come on.

46
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,390
Proper stance. Oh!

47
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,429
You said a proper stance,
not an improper one.

48
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,431
Go on.

49
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,935
- Cross stance.
- What else?

50
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,938
Unicorn. Left, then right.

51
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,445
- Firm enough?
- Very firm.

52
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,447
- Then move.
- Oh. I can't.

53
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:06,449
Why not?

54
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,453
Because it's too firm.

55
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,455
Oh, really?

56
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,458
Hmm. Can you make another firm stance?

57
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,925
Oh, yes.

58
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,463
The twisted stance. Look at this.

59
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:22,430
Not that.

60
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,467
Another new one?

61
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,936
The upside-down.

62
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,473
Aah! Not that one!

63
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,743
Get up there!

64
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:35,978
Now stay there.

65
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,987
Stay steady, and mind my bowl.

66
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:48,491
This bowl I collect my income in.

67
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:50,458
Take care.

68
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,496
If anything happens
to it, you've had it.

69
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,501
Grandfather, where are you going?

70
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,969
I'm going to the toilet.

71
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,007
No! I can't bear it!
Come back quickly!

72
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:08,010
- This one is pretty.
- Ah.

73
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,514
This one is for you.

74
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,017
And this one is for you.

75
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,019
Unicorn!

76
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,522
No, I'm sorry. It's not for sale.

77
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:21,524
Here, son.

78
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,003
Place your bets!

79
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,042
Bet with your eyes. A
lot quicker than by hand.

80
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:42,044
Come on, place your bets.

81
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,046
I'll try.

82
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,551
Quickly. Quickly!

83
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,555
Place your bets! Hey,
hey, hey! Hands off!

84
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,558
There are only a few
winners. Hands off, hands off.

85
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,560
No bet.

86
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,563
Ahh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

87
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,066
Over to me. There we are.

88
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,075
Put it all on.

89
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,580
You don't really want to
play anymore, now, do you?

90
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,547
But it's so easy.

91
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,085
- Ah, so easy.
- I'll go when i've won this.

92
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,088
Ah. Don't move. Look!

93
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,594
No! You missed it!

94
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,100
Such bad luck. Beaten again.

95
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,067
I must win this time.

96
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,571
- Here, I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

97
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,109
Here, let
me change it. You won't regret it.

98
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,113
Just you wait and see, all right?

99
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,119
Ah, and now this one.

100
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:59,121
Open.

101
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,626
Open.

102
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,597
You win.

103
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,100
Winners again.

104
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,137
That's mine! That's yours.

105
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:20,142
For helping you to win, I'm
going to take this as my tip.

106
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:23,162
Good-Bye. Don't go. Let's go again.

107
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:26,148
No more now. You'll lose everything.

108
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,674
Mmm.

109
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,178
Eh? You're big. Why
didn't he see you?

110
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,180
Mmm. Slow up!

111
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,436
Wine and food? Celebrating
new year, are you?

112
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:08,332
- What do you want?
- You to stay away!

113
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:12,194
- Who are you to tell me?
- Who am I?

114
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,697
Huh.

115
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,703
You must have heard of the great bear.

116
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:23,205
And stony egg. And ironhead.

117
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,207
Watch out! That's me!

118
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,460
I don't give a damn who you are.

119
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,213
Go on, get him. Stay there!

120
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,718
You had better return all the money.

121
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:37,685
Right! Right!

122
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,724
- Why should I?
- Because of this.

123
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,726
Kill! Get him!

124
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,734
Huh?

125
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,746
Good.

126
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,713
He beat me.

127
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,250
Don't be worried, little
one. You must beat him back.

128
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,252
Don't you worry. I'll try.

129
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,756
Don't worry.

130
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,758
Hyaaah!

131
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,272
Stop!

132
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,281
An earthquake!

133
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,764
Ohh! Oh, my head!

134
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,801
There's a hole in the ground!

135
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,303
My head! Ohhh!

136
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,810
- What's your name?
- Stony egg.

137
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,777
But now... ohh!

138
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,779
You're a broken egg!

139
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,066
Now you're a scrambled
egg!

140
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,318
Now you're a rotten egg!

141
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,322
All right, Humpty-Dumpty?

142
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,295
And you're ironhead?

143
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,833
You hit there. Now hit there.

144
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,849
Go around!

145
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,103
Head up!

146
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,355
Turn away!

147
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,358
Run away.

148
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,379
Kill him!

149
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,897
You're a very big man
with a very small brain.

150
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,901
He's called the great bear,
but he looks smaller from here.

151
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:41,170
You wanna fight?

152
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:43,405
Help!

153
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,412
You nearly crushed me dead!

154
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,918
- You want the money back now?
- No, I don't!

155
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:58,921
- I'm going.
- Of course you can go now.

156
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,940
Don't try to follow me.

157
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,890
No, we won't follow.

158
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,177
W- What shall we do?

159
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,429
Get him up right now.

160
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,933
Let's go.

161
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,402
Mmm. Good wine.

162
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,439
It's from the same place?

163
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:19,458
Same shop as usual,

164
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,443
but it's much better.

165
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,413
Much more than usual.

166
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,451
- Yes, much more.
- Good boy.

167
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,422
- Where did you get the money?
- Huh?

168
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,459
I was very lucky. I found
some money out in the street.

169
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,962
That's why I bought it for you.

170
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:42,930
- You were lucky.
- Yes.

171
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,467
You go out and see if you
can find some more money.

172
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,971
The truth.

173
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,443
What's that?

174
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,982
One became two, two became
four, four became eight.

175
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:03,951
Oh. You've been gambling.

176
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,488
And they asked you to return it.

177
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,008
Yes! How did you know, grandpa?

178
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:11,458
And you showed them your kung fu.

179
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,998
No, I didn't. I merely struck
a pose, and they let me leave.

180
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,017
And what pose was that?

181
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:20,002
Well, it was very basic.

182
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,004
You twit!

183
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,006
I'll practice. You enjoy your wine.

184
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,008
- Wait.
- No need to train today?

185
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,013
- Yes, but I'll train with you.
- Huh?

186
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,993
Come on. Grandpa.

187
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,531
All's fair in love and
war. I'm your grandson.

188
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,537
Ah, still
up to your tricks again.

189
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,302
That is called short but dangerous.

190
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,055
Well, I'll take the short one, then.

191
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,533
Ohh! Aah! Aa-Aah!

192
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,071
Wait! We're not through.

193
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,047
You missed.

194
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,049
This is called long but powerful.

195
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:46,588
Whatever you say. Long and
short, I'll take them all.

196
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,594
Hey!

197
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,854
Practice makes perfect.

198
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,607
I'm sure you're right.

199
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,080
Rabbit. Broken thread.

200
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,618
Tree. Cloud.
Fisherman. Flying phoenix.

201
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,121
- Hey.
- I'm not through yet.

202
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,123
- The flute player.
- Hold it!

203
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,125
Tiger's tail.

204
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,127
Now let's practice.

205
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,629
Hey, where you going? Tiger's tail.

206
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,597
Tiger's tail.

207
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,134
First, second and third.

208
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:35,637
Iron gate. Iron wall.

209
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,605
Ha.

210
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,142
This is known as following the tide.

211
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:43,645
Now here I come. The sweeping broom!

212
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,651
Grandpa, take it easy!

213
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
I'm not like you.

214
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,659
Shooting star.

215
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,127
No!

216
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,664
Dizzy? Now I am.

217
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,172
No, no, no, no. On the head. Look up.

218
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:12,692
Casting the net. Snowflakes.

219
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:15,703
Rooting a tree. The mill.

220
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,680
Dragonfly. Forest birds.

221
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,151
- Come out.
- No. No.

222
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,688
- This bird's staying.
- You're not coming?

223
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,690
Oh. Maybe a little force will help.

224
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,692
No! No, no! No, no! No!

225
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,946
I- I'm coming.

226
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,199
Rolling guard!

227
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,954
One becomes two!

228
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,207
Two becomes four!

229
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,675
- Grandpa
- You idiot!

230
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,213
- My head's sore.
- Shut up!

231
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,216
Stick on the back.

232
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,218
Withdraw. Withdraw. Withdraw.

233
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,720
Let's see when you will behave yourself.

234
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,223
Sweeping strike.

235
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,725
Oh. Embrace the moon.

236
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,744
Advance to defend.

237
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,729
The swallow's jump.

238
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,234
- Why aren't you jumping?
- I'll jump later.

239
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:15,202
Later? I'll help you.

240
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,205
No, this is it!

241
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,707
- That's the end.
- What?

242
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,745
That's the end! But I'm starting.

243
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,712
Grandpa, stop or I'll die.

244
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,715
How will you learn if you stop?

245
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,754
How many times have I said, "don't
teach our kung fu to others"?

246
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,756
But you insist on doing it.

247
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,724
Our kung fu isn't illegal.

248
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,265
You mustn't teach other
people, or I'll thrash you.

249
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,534
Well, I'll try.

250
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,734
But you must.

251
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,273
Go and get yourself a proper job,

252
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,275
like everyone else.

253
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,777
You idiot.

254
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,782
Come on. Try it.

255
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,751
Mister, will
you buy-

256
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,788
Boy, why are you so happy?

257
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,793
Mister, will you buy

258
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,298
Mister, why the hell
are you so damn sad?

259
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,301
Is it you or me who's lost someone?

260
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,303
Now I'll serve you.

261
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,309
Here.

262
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,314
Mister,

263
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,320
This comes when we don't expect it.

264
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,322
You need someone...

265
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,827
to handle all the arrangements for you.

266
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,832
And now, remember that we
have all types of caskets...

267
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,587
poor type, normal type,
rich type, super-rich type.

268
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:59,841
And if someone comes in
dressed like me, then...

269
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:02,809
you show them this one here, huh?

270
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:08,350
And if someone comes in dressed in
filthy rags, then show them this one here.

271
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,354
This type is meant for the likes of you.

272
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:17,359
What? How can anyone be buried
in this thing? It's rotten.

273
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,362
Why not? All these coffins
have been used before.

274
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:22,329
At least more than three times.

275
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,866
- More than three?
- These are secondhand.

276
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:26,833
What's secondhand?

277
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:31,373
When we dig them up, that
is called secondhand goods.

278
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,341
- Who will buy them?
- Everyone.

279
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,878
My funeral parlor has a monopoly.

280
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,398
- We sell them.
- Is it ethical?

281
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:41,883
Ehh. No talk of ethics here.

282
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:44,351
Remember. Oh.

283
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,390
Also, you will have to
remember the various brands.

284
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:52,394
Now, this is teakwood,
rosewood, willow wood,

285
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,396
And that's cardboard.

286
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,899
When customers come,
knock and let them hear.

287
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,403
Boss, it sounds like plywood.

288
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:03,405
Hey, they're not to know that.

289
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,907
You're dumb. Come over here.

290
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,411
Now, my precious,

291
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:12,879
You're not for sale.

292
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,882
- Is it for you?
- Yes- Uh, no!

293
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,422
If the price is right, then
I'm willing to sell her.

294
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:25,392
Ah, I have polished her every day.

295
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,930
And, oh, don't forget to tell
the client her good points.

296
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:30,897
Which are?

297
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,899
Let me show you.

298
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:37,439
Now, living people would
find it comfortable...

299
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:39,406
because it is completely airtight.

300
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,444
- They'd suffocate.
- But not with a built-in fan.

301
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,411
Oh.

302
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,449
I wouldn't mind living in there.

303
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,452
Let me demonstrate. Inside.

304
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,958
Nice and comfortable.

305
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,462
So cool and peaceful.

306
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:02,429
Listen to this.

307
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,967
Come, listen. Listen to this.

308
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:08,987
It's like someone calling me.

309
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:11,938
Ohh! Ohh! Oh!

310
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,940
It's frightening.

311
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,942
Idiot! Would you like...

312
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,480
Would you like to try it?

313
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:20,499
It's too narrow.

314
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,449
But it's not.

315
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,987
It's big enough for three. Okay.

316
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,455
Aah! Ohh!

317
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,992
My god! What the hell's happening?

318
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,959
I was only demonstrating!

319
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,497
I didn't ask you to shut
me in! Let me out of here!

320
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:38,500
I'll kill you when I
get my hands on you!

321
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,503
You'll be in here,
and I'll be out there.

322
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,507
What are you trying to do to me,
you little bastard?

323
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:48,009
- Aaah!
- I can't get you out.

324
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,513
- Hey, did you find him?
- Nope.

325
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,515
He is nowhere.

326
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,019
- Hey, find him?
- No!

327
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,023
Damn his ass! Where
the hell has he got to?

328
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,511
I don't want trouble.

329
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,513
If you continue to follow me,

330
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,551
I'll break every bone in your body!

331
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,022
- Big brother.
- Damn it, who's your brother?

332
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:41,062
Uh, we three think that you
are the greatest. We really do.

333
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,029
You what?

334
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:46,067
I can't even take care
of myself, you fools.

335
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:48,535
You all want to end up being like that?

336
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,073
But, my brother, we
think you're the greatest.

337
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:54,040
The time is right.

338
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,078
You can make a lot of money.

339
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,581
Right! Why don't you make it, then?

340
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,551
I think you're all mad. Hey! Hey!

341
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,589
We can't make it without
you. I already have problems.

342
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,556
Don't you give me any more.

343
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,845
Hey, wait, we wouldn't dare
cause you trouble, my friend.

344
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,064
If I do any wrong, I'll
change my name to Rotten Egg.

345
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:22,604
Right, and you can break my
iron head any time that you like.

346
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:25,572
Hey, you've nothing to lose.

347
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,110
Come with us and meet our boss. Right.

348
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:32,614
Oh, then maybe I'll come along with you.

349
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,781
Well, now,

350
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:37,784
It's nice of you to come.

351
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:42,824
And what do you think of
Ti Cha's proposal, hmm?

352
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,826
Teacher? Who's the teacher?

353
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:47,294
No teacher.

354
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:50,297
Oh! My name is Ti Cha.

355
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:53,335
Said quickly together,
they sound the same.

356
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,303
It gives me an air of superiority.

357
00:25:56,338 --> 00:26:00,342
- You must come from Japan.
- Why do you say that?

358
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:02,344
An imitation.

359
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,811
That's not funny!

360
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,848
Little gimmicks are important...

361
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:08,850
right. If you want to succeed.

362
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:11,318
Right. Right. Right.

363
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:14,356
My friend, why don't
you coach at our school?

364
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:16,358
Your monthly salary will be 100 tails.

365
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:20,862
On top of that, any fees
will be shared by us both.

366
00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:23,882
Also, I'll pay when you fight.

367
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,868
- Isn't that fair?
- Yes! Yes!

368
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:29,336
One hundred?

369
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,338
One hundred.

370
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:35,877
I want it, but then
there's my grandfather.

371
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:38,397
He forbids me to fight anywhere.

372
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,882
You've no idea what he's like.

373
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:46,888
Hey!

374
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,859
All I know is, I have ideas.

375
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:57,399
Now, all I want is for you to fight.

376
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,901
- But my grandpa!
- You wait.

377
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,909
And that is all.

378
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:09,876
But will it work?

379
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,878
But of course it will.

380
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:15,417
Now, after lunch I'll take you
to see our beautiful school.

381
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,887
What is the everything clan?

382
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:24,175
Well, we teach every type of kung fu.

383
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,429
That's why we call the school that name.

384
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,932
What crap. You've nothing.

385
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,899
Hah, that's right.

386
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:36,938
When we started, two students,
and they're nonpaying.

387
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:38,905
Isn't that disgraceful?

388
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,945
So then, it's important to
choose the right name. Right?

389
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,949
Hah, right. My young friend, help me.

390
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,953
A name. Now, that's hard.

391
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,460
What do you teach?

392
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:04,431
We teach the S.S.S.

393
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:07,969
- No such thing.
- Huh? But of course!

394
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:11,473
First, let me explain
what they stand for.

395
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,493
One, you're smart if you join.

396
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:17,505
Two, it's the silver you must pay.

397
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,447
And lastly is our superb kung fu.

398
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:25,987
- What if I refuse to join?
- Well, then they stand for something else.

399
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:27,989
Firstly, you're stupid not to join.

400
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,492
Second, we're sorry we wasted time.

401
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,494
And lastly, you must leave soon.

402
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:35,497
Why not make me go?

403
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,499
Now, wait. Let me change first.

404
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,502
If you have guts, then
you'll wait. See to him.

405
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:42,504
Oh.

406
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:52,013
Uh, M-Master.

407
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,519
Master.

408
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,022
What's up?

409
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,525
Uh, business.

410
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,492
What business?

411
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:08,530
Uh, take a look. Come. Come.

412
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:18,540
He's the
bodyguard of a big brothel.

413
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,507
He-

414
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,509
Uh, I'm sorry.

415
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:26,548
He has students-
Some say 40 or 50.

416
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:30,552
If you beat him, they will come here.

417
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:33,520
One is 15 tails.

418
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:37,058
One-Fifty for ten. That
isn't bad money, huh?

419
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:39,025
Right.

420
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,027
Fifteen is 225.

421
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,064
- And 20?
- Three, clear.

422
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:45,031
- Thirty?
- Uh, that's...

423
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,819
Don't worry about that. Just fight.

424
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:50,464
But it isn't that simple. You look.

425
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:53,038
He is enormous and so damned fierce.

426
00:29:53,073 --> 00:29:55,326
Just look at the size of what hits.

427
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,579
I won't fight. Get someone else.

428
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,046
Hey, we have a deal.

429
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:02,549
I use my head, you, your hands.

430
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:06,588
Well, how much will you pay
me for my hands, teacher?

431
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:09,340
Uh, all right, 50.

432
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,485
- Oh, it hurts!
- Uh, 60.

433
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,560
- Oh, my legs!
- Uh, 70.

434
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,562
- My stomach! My head!
- Uh, 80. 90!

435
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:19,100
- Oh, my shoes ache.
- The shoes ache? Uh, a hundred.

436
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:23,605
Eh? They've all stopped. Go first.

437
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,107
- You'll come?
- Oh, yes.

438
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:28,610
Hmm. Hmm.

439
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:32,113
Damn!

440
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:36,618
Is that fat fool coming out or not?

441
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:44,375
What is wrong, eh?

442
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,127
You haven't changed.

443
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:49,095
Heh. Very clever.

444
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,598
I am the master, after all.

445
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:55,136
I'm not cruel, so i've
decided not to fight you.

446
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:57,103
Bullshit!

447
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,641
I'll fight you if it's
the last thing I do.

448
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:06,648
You toady. You're
really asking for it now.

449
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:08,650
You insist?

450
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,154
Well, my lowest laborer
can give you a lesson now.

451
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:15,657
Okay? He'll enjoy it.

452
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:17,659
Here.

453
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:23,164
Now... Why are you here?

454
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:25,131
Master.

455
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,168
You idiot...

456
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,673
Now you teach him a lesson.

457
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:35,141
- That thing?
- Uh, right!

458
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,179
This one is good enough for you.

459
00:31:38,214 --> 00:31:40,181
- Go on.
- Okay.

460
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:53,660
- Do you want to fight?
- Yes.

461
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:57,198
Don't get so mad. Have
a cup of tea first.

462
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,202
Heh! Ho!

463
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:26,728
What you looking for?

464
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,232
Be careful.

465
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:41,993
Woo-Woo-Woo-Woo-Woo

466
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:44,245
Aah!

467
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,824
Master, i've beaten him.

468
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,344
- Back to work.
- Hah!

469
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,829
Hmm.

470
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,834
Admit defeat.

471
00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:16,838
You're beaten. "Yes."

472
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:21,843
You'll hand over the
protection money? "Yes."

473
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:25,847
And I'll take over your school? "Yes."

474
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:29,350
And you'll leave now? "Yes."

475
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:32,353
Did you hear that?

476
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:38,825
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

477
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,862
- Well, take him away.
- Yes.

478
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:46,868
Quickly!

479
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,378
- Hey there.
- Hmm?

480
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,382
Why are you standing there?

481
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,886
Are you the one who defeated Lu Ying?

482
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,855
Correct. I'm the one.

483
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,893
- You must be good.
- Hmm.

484
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:13,860
Yes, I am good.

485
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:16,863
In fact, I'm one of the best.

486
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:20,902
Oh. Then I want to
see how good you are.

487
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:22,904
Show me your finger technique.

488
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:24,871
Uh...

489
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:29,410
Eh? Nobody learns any of
my techniques without paying!

490
00:35:29,445 --> 00:35:31,377
Right. Right.

491
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:34,415
Shiao Seng! Shiao Seng! Shiao Seng!

492
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,883
Shiao Seng!

493
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,921
Why don't you answer when I call you?

494
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:41,940
That's not my name.

495
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:43,951
It's what I call you.

496
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:45,892
Look. Another one.

497
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:47,894
Small one. He'll be easy.

498
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:51,933
Oh? Then how about a discount?

499
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:54,936
- Twenty percent.
- Good.

500
00:35:54,971 --> 00:35:56,938
Let's start!

501
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:05,411
Name, please.

502
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,948
I am the willow sword.

503
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:10,451
What? "Shitso"?

504
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,472
Kicking!

505
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:33,975
I'm mad!

506
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,008
Waah!

507
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,989
More money against a sword!

508
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:25,026
- Uh, ten! What?
- Do it yourself!

509
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:28,995
- Well?
- Uh, 20?

510
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,032
- How much?
- Thirty!

511
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:35,036
More!

512
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:48,014
- Forty!
- Forty?

513
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:50,551
- Seventy! Seventy!
- Forty, maximum!

514
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:52,518
Aaah! Aaah!

515
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:54,555
- Double! Double!
- Double it?

516
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:58,559
It's a deal.

517
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:09,570
This time it's for real!

518
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:23,584
Did that hurt your balls?

519
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:50,611
Hyah!

520
00:38:53,614 --> 00:38:55,581
Hah!

521
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:58,119
Try hitting it now.

522
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,608
Down! Up! Down! Up!

523
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:25,646
Down! Up! Down! Up! Down! Up!

524
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:27,648
Yeah! Music time!

525
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,657
It's stuck.

526
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:44,665
You're bleeding.

527
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,168
- Aaah!
- Wrong side.

528
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:55,176
That was bad!

529
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,194
I think you still have a lot to learn.

530
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:15,696
I'll show you what I know!

531
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:23,169
Aaah!

532
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:25,206
You stupid bastard!

533
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,218
This is not funny.

534
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,234
My advantage! Now see
about your britches!

535
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,738
Don't leave!

536
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,746
Now, don't use your sword.

537
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:07,713
Only when you have to.

538
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:10,751
Otherwise, you might lose your nose.

539
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:12,753
- Run!
- Aah! Yes!

540
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:31,772
- Come here.
- Yes, grandfather.

541
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:39,745
Grandfather.

542
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,747
Are you feeling better?

543
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:44,750
- Much better.
- You need more rest.

544
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:48,289
Hey, I'll get you some tea.

545
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:55,295
Where are you working now?

546
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,763
Still the same old place.

547
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:01,302
You must be good and obedient...

548
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:03,804
to the people you work for.

549
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,307
I'm very obedient.

550
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,313
- Is work hard?
- No, not at all.

551
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,315
Just fighting and...

552
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:18,819
Uh, grandfather, I'll
go and get your medicine.

553
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:25,826
Master.

554
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:27,828
What's wrong?

555
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:29,830
It's big business coming in.

556
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:32,333
- Big?
- Yes.

557
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:34,335
Take a look.

558
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:43,594
- Wow, he's huge.
- Yes, he is quite big.

559
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:46,312
Hey, I think I
know him. He's a...

560
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:51,352
Not as big as me. I'll tie
him up and throw him out.

561
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:54,355
You think that he's
as stupid as you are?

562
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,358
If you want to beat him, go ahead.

563
00:42:57,393 --> 00:42:59,878
Uh, master, you can do it.

564
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:02,328
- You don't say.
- Yes, yes.

565
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:05,331
Look at yourself. You're wealthy.

566
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:08,369
- What?
- Gold there. More there. And there.

567
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:11,372
- Even your teeth are gold.
- They're not.

568
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:13,339
Well, almost.

569
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:16,342
You're wealthy now. You wear the best.

570
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:19,345
Your food's the best.
You're chubby all over.

571
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,884
We have to risk our lives to pay
for that? We'll soon be dead!

572
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:29,890
Well, if you don't fight him,
who's gonna pay all the expenses?

573
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:31,857
I don't know.

574
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:33,859
Eh, uh, 500 tails!

575
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:36,862
Five hundred?

576
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:40,401
- Y- Y-Y-Y-Yes!
- Promise?

577
00:43:40,436 --> 00:43:42,670
Yes? All right!

578
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,870
Don't move!

579
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:47,908
Do you know him?
He's a sex maniac.

580
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:49,910
Really?

581
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:55,416
- Yes, you can go.
- Uh, thank you, thank you, uh...

582
00:43:55,451 --> 00:43:57,383
Uh, where is he?

583
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:59,670
You go on out. Then I'll follow.

584
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:01,922
- You rascal!
- So says the master!

585
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:04,925
Oh!

586
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:13,399
Uh, not bad.

587
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:16,937
But it's nothing compared
to our little waiter.

588
00:44:16,972 --> 00:44:18,939
Get the fellow out here!

589
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,907
Be patient.

590
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:25,446
You'll wear yourself
out before you start.

591
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:26,912
I've no time!

592
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:30,451
Let me tell you something.

593
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:33,954
Learn self control if you want to win.

594
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:37,458
Otherwise, you're as good as dead.

595
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:39,960
Goddamn you!

596
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:52,973
Eh, there he is.

597
00:44:53,008 --> 00:44:55,441
Aah! You?

598
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:59,480
The master's
out, and I'll take his place.

599
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:03,484
Be careful of that
shark. He'll eat you up.

600
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:05,486
Aah! Yes.

601
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:10,956
Ooh!

602
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:14,995
Oh, you look so pretty.
My heart is throbbing.

603
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,500
I'm worried. You're so big and strong.

604
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:21,467
- Don't worry.
- But why?

605
00:45:21,502 --> 00:45:25,506
Don't worry, don't worry.
Here, give me a kiss.

606
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:30,010
Oooh!

607
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:35,766
I'll hit you if you do that again.

608
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:38,519
Hit me again. Hit me all you want.

609
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,990
Oh, it's sore.

610
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:46,992
- Let me soothe it.
- No.

611
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:51,532
- What big hands!
- How big? Big enough to do this?

612
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,293
Aah! Do that, and I'll give you hell!

613
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:06,547
So, you know kung fu.

614
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:08,549
Just a little.

615
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:11,552
Right. Let's have some
fun!

616
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:18,524
What hairy legs! Oh!

617
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,562
Don't you think they're sexy? Whoo!

618
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:24,530
Wow! And such big feet.

619
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:27,568
To step on you with, stupid.

620
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:29,570
Huh?

621
00:46:35,576 --> 00:46:36,577
Wait!

622
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:40,546
Wait.

623
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:44,585
Slowly, I'm going to
pull down the blind.

624
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,087
Hmm!

625
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:59,600
Well, what are you
doing, lying down there?

626
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:02,370
Are you angry?

627
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:05,105
Naturally!

628
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:16,617
Great. That's great.

629
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,623
Ooh! Mmm!

630
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:34,635
Let me do it.

631
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:48,148
L- Let me, let me.

632
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,617
He's a fella! Aah!

633
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:54,655
Huh? You're a fella? Oh. Waaah!

634
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,412
Hit this!

635
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,665
And this!

636
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:10,170
That's mine. Hand it over.

637
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:12,137
The money's mine!

638
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:14,139
Aaah! Take it back now!

639
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:18,178
H- He doesn't
want it!

640
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:33,193
Tell me, where is Chen
of the Sien Yi clan?

641
00:48:33,228 --> 00:48:35,195
Oh... I...

642
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:45,706
Master, someone in the village
has put up the Sien Yi school sign.

643
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:27,247
What the hell is this?

644
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,003
Grandfather, don't feel sad...

645
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:36,649
if one day I should be killed.

646
00:49:36,684 --> 00:49:40,260
This money is to provide for you.

647
00:49:40,295 --> 00:49:42,763
Your loving grandson.

648
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:11,256
Three in a row! Yes!

649
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,294
- Every move is superb!
- Oh, look at that!

650
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,803
Better ones coming up.

651
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:36,817
Did you see that?

652
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:40,570
On the head! On the ass!

653
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:43,323
You see how obedient he is?

654
00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:46,827
Yeow! One for the toe!

655
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:48,794
And one for the bottom!

656
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:50,831
Yaaah! He's gone for a crap!

657
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:53,799
A crap!

658
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:57,337
Well done! Now the
money will all be mine!

659
00:50:57,372 --> 00:50:59,840
I can't wait to see it!

660
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,852
Nice.

661
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,361
Nuhh!

662
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:32,873
You lost on purpose! Are you
trying for another increase?

663
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:40,345
We made a deal. No more.

664
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,383
But this time I don't want anything!

665
00:51:44,384 --> 00:51:48,388
Stop! You beat me!
You can take the money!

666
00:51:48,423 --> 00:51:50,891
- Let me go!
- You can't go!

667
00:51:52,392 --> 00:51:54,895
That beast said that I won!

668
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:56,862
I'm ruined!

669
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:58,899
Who are you calling a beast?

670
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:03,904
Well done!

671
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,838
Mister!

672
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,876
You're good. I'd like
to employ you here.

673
00:52:09,911 --> 00:52:12,844
Get lost!

674
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,383
- He knows kung fu.
- Mind your own business.

675
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:18,850
What's wrong?

676
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,388
- How come you're so hairy?
- I'm not hairy.

677
00:52:21,423 --> 00:52:24,356
It's up here.

678
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,858
Hey, who the hell was he?

679
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,396
Hey, what the hell was he
doing roaming around here?

680
00:52:29,431 --> 00:52:32,166
That's true. That's right!

681
00:52:32,201 --> 00:52:34,901
Found him! Say there!

682
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,871
You are?

683
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,910
- Where's my grandson?
- There aren't any grandsons here.

684
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:45,912
Who are you?

685
00:52:45,947 --> 00:52:47,879
I am...

686
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,417
I am the leader of this place.

687
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,887
God damn him. That great name.

688
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,925
Hey, we've been very fortunate
since we changed the name.

689
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,678
Where's the master?

690
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:04,323
Yes, where is he?

691
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:06,933
He ran off long ago.

692
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,438
Hey, who are you?

693
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,942
I'm your master's master.

694
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,960
Master!

695
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,489
He's your man.

696
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,753
I've really had it this time.

697
00:54:16,788 --> 00:54:19,506
My grandfather will kill me.

698
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:35,021
Boy, where does Chen Ping Fe live?

699
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:55,041
Silly boy.

700
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,796
Chen Ping Fe. Grandpa.

701
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,561
Chen Ping Fe, you can't run.

702
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,567
I won't run.

703
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,071
It's not that you
won't run.

704
00:55:25,106 --> 00:55:27,539
You can't run.

705
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,577
Don't you feel lonely
living here alone?

706
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,583
You are always following.
How can I be lonely?

707
00:55:37,618 --> 00:55:42,088
Chen Ping Fe, you'd
better start digging...

708
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,091
or you won't be buried.

709
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,616
Old man, you're too sick.

710
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:11,618
Get up.

711
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,136
Old man, you're finished.

712
00:56:30,171 --> 00:56:32,639
I may as well kill you.

713
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,648
Aah!

714
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,708
The unicorn.

715
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,714
He won't escape.

716
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,235
Grandpa!

717
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,740
Grandpa!

718
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,245
Grandpa!

719
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,248
Grandpa!

720
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,264
If you... Grandpa
wouldn't be dead.

721
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:45,271
If not for me, you would be dead.

722
00:58:45,306 --> 00:58:47,273
Y- You bastard!

723
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,784
You should be ashamed.
It's all your fault.

724
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,753
Grandpa!

725
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,792
If you hadn't left a trail,
Yen wouldn't have found him.

726
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,798
Who's Yen? Why did he kill him?

727
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,265
Why did he kill grandpa?

728
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,303
He killed him because...

729
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:20,271
our clan fought the Ching.

730
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:24,275
You're with our clan?

731
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,814
That's right. Your
grandfather was looking for me.

732
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,321
You are... You
are the unicorn.

733
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,296
You're not fit to be his friend!

734
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:48,835
You just stood by while
he was being killed!

735
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:52,105
Tell me, how the hell could I help?

736
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,341
Even without kung fu, he'd win.

737
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:02,849
- Where are you going?
- To kill him.

738
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:13,359
You can't beat a cripple like
me. How can you beat him?

739
01:00:13,394 --> 01:00:18,364
You go, and your grandfather's
body will rot here.

740
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,868
Grandpa!

741
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,840
As long as you're alive,

742
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,878
there'll be chances for revenge.

743
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,882
I'll kill him!

744
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,890
Aside from revenge, you must eat.

745
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,894
Try it.

746
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,902
Ah, don't eat rice.

747
01:00:55,937 --> 01:00:57,904
Eat this!

748
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,908
Hey.

749
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,487
Eat.

750
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,535
Shing, take a rest.

751
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,540
Master, I'm not tired.

752
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,596
Master.

753
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,602
Oh, that really hurt.

754
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,641
Pull me along.

755
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,150
Come on.

756
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,154
Go on.

757
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,671
- What, no strength?
- I can't with you on top.

758
01:05:25,706 --> 01:05:27,941
Well, I'm down now.

759
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:30,176
Then I can do it.

760
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,148
Oh!

761
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,935
- Did that hurt?
- Yes, of course.

762
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,688
That's because you didn't yelp.

763
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,692
Yelp? What?

764
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,695
Okay.

765
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,701
Yelp. Yelp.

766
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,670
- No more.
- Why not?

767
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:04,710
- It's time to go home and eat.
- Eat? Great.

768
01:06:04,745 --> 01:06:07,713
- What's this?
- That one's for you.

769
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:12,218
Yelp. Yelp. Yelp.

770
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,723
Hey. Hey.

771
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,731
You're usually very happy. Why so sad?

772
01:06:25,766 --> 01:06:29,235
It's far too much yelping.

773
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,238
Ah, get up.

774
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:39,245
You're out of breath. Breathe in.

775
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,248
All right.

776
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,252
Breathe out.

777
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:48,219
In!

778
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,756
Close your mouth. Swallow it.

779
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,760
Hold your breath.

780
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,267
Too late.

781
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,239
Yelp.

782
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,277
That was too early.

783
01:07:11,312 --> 01:07:14,245
Master.

784
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,282
Keep working.

785
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,263
Master. Master!

786
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:36,767
Such a lot of commotion.

787
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:39,805
And you sleep through it like a pig.

788
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,772
Who's been here?

789
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,775
If someone had been here,
you'd be dead for sure.

790
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:49,815
Well, I will have
to sleep with one eye open.

791
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,817
Oh, like this?

792
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,286
In kung fu,

793
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,824
you must learn to use
your brains as well.

794
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,792
Otherwise,

795
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:06,332
you'll tire yourself.

796
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:11,837
Now, already you're losing your voice.

797
01:08:11,872 --> 01:08:13,804
Show me.

798
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:18,343
I'll teach you to
adjust to circumstances.

799
01:08:18,378 --> 01:08:22,848
Now, see if you can get past that door.

800
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,357
Go on.

801
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,919
Comfortable?

802
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,431
What's wrong now?

803
01:09:45,466 --> 01:09:48,434
Don't let it slip.

804
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,948
Your waist.

805
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,467
Come here.

806
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,970
Up to your tricks again.

807
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,972
Move!

808
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,476
My hand. Now your legs.

809
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,946
Oh! Oh.

810
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:38,984
Just like a dead chicken.

811
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:45,491
You're getting stuck in the wrong door.

812
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,965
Forget it!

813
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,004
- There's another window.
- Thanks.

814
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,508
Useless bum.

815
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,542
Master, catch!

816
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,048
Well, not so bad, eh?

817
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:45,551
Not bad.

818
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,553
Now, catch!

819
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:59,064
Master. Master.

820
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,533
There.

821
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,571
I'm still one up on you.

822
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,084
Shing Lung, I'll go get some wine.

823
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:21,051
You wait here.

824
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:23,088
I'll go over there.

825
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,120
Hey, master, you gave me too much.

826
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,259
You...

827
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,269
What do you want?

828
01:14:00,304 --> 01:14:02,271
Speak up.

829
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,778
Why the
hell did you attack me?

830
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,285
Dumb kid. And he's crazy.

831
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,287
Sir, let's go.

832
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,307
Goddamn!

833
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,815
Young man, what's your
grievance? You're crazy.

834
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,325
Your kung fu is not bad.

835
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,833
You dare fight me
without knowing anything.

836
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,836
You're dreaming.

837
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,868
You!

838
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,872
You must be tired of living.

839
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,377
I'll help.

840
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,885
How dare you bite me.

841
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,428
You stupid boy! Causing
trouble everywhere.

842
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:48,437
Sorry. He's always
causing trouble. Damn him!

843
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:50,939
Let's go home.

844
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,923
Lord, I beg your forgiveness.

845
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:13,962
If you're his grandpa,
you should teach him.

846
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:15,929
Yes, sir.

847
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,467
I'll take him home.

848
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,973
Sorry. Come on, you stupid boy.

849
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,484
The unicorn!

850
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,996
- He's disappeared.
- He can't get away.

851
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,966
Aah! You're so impulsive.

852
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,969
Fortunately I came in the nick of time.

853
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:59,007
How many times do I have to
tell you you must change?

854
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,012
I'm useless.

855
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,981
No good.

856
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,519
It's too late to be sorry.

857
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,523
You're lucky you didn't get
injured badly by them this time.

858
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,492
Lucky?

859
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,531
I am glad you were too angry
to remember our clan's kung fu.

860
01:18:22,566 --> 01:18:26,535
He didn't know who you were.
Otherwise he would have killed you.

861
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:30,806
That's why he only
wounded you very slightly.

862
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:35,043
You were very lucky to
get away with your life.

863
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:37,010
Now,

864
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,547
Let me tell you something
about your kung fu.

865
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:42,050
It isn't too bad. It's
just that you're erratic.

866
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:44,017
That is why you feel so tired.

867
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,054
You can't attack well because
you're wasting your energy.

868
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,317
Then what do I do?

869
01:18:59,352 --> 01:19:01,535
I think you know...

870
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,322
our clan's techniques by now.

871
01:19:04,357 --> 01:19:07,075
Well, now I want to teach you...

872
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:09,094
a new technique.

873
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:11,105
This technique...

874
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,362
will be Jian.

875
01:19:13,397 --> 01:19:15,741
Joy, sorrow,

876
01:19:15,776 --> 01:19:18,051
down, up,

877
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,054
real, imaginary.

878
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,842
Play on your opponent's emotions...

879
01:19:23,877 --> 01:19:26,560
and affect his judgment to win.

880
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,097
And remember that you are not alone.

881
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:36,605
Now I'm going
to teach you a new technique.

882
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,073
It's derived from the wire fist.

883
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:43,862
You must use your
brain and body together,

884
01:19:43,897 --> 01:19:47,616
Thereby exerting your
power to the fullest.

885
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:52,621
Play on your opponent's basic emotions.

886
01:20:00,163 --> 01:20:04,132
Joy will help you to remain here.

887
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,650
Anger allows you to attack viciously.

888
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:49,678
Sorrow will fool him till the very end.

889
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:07,195
Happiness will tease him and scare him.

890
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,221
Master.

891
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,728
Master!

892
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,735
Master!

893
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:03,251
Unicorn, let's see if you
can crawl any further now.

894
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,256
Stop! Damn, you beat an old man up!

895
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,224
Kid, you can speak.

896
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,763
I am not dumb, though you really are.

897
01:22:14,798 --> 01:22:16,765
- Huh?
- Brother.

898
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,768
I will kill him.

899
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,271
You son of a bitch!

900
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,791
- You dare to call me that?
- You!

901
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:57,305
You damned idiot!
Can't you even stand up?

902
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,575
Chicken!

903
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:01,810
Use it.

904
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,830
Once more, please.

905
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,372
- Still bursting?
- Brother, feel better.

906
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:08,376
I'm better. Ready?

907
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,938
Missed me!

908
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,497
Missing something?

909
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:31,985
Kill him!

910
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,522
Kill the bastard!

911
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,525
Stay there, or I'll kill him!

912
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,527
No, don't worry.

913
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:42,530
Give that to me!

914
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,001
Killer!

915
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:51,539
If you must, you may as well kill him...

916
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:55,043
or he'll only be a useless cripple...

917
01:26:55,078 --> 01:26:57,312
for the rest of his life!

918
01:26:57,347 --> 01:26:59,547
You kill him!

919
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:06,054
Master, don't worry. I'll get them.

920
01:27:06,089 --> 01:27:09,557
He will, but at what price?

921
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,062
Master!

922
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:17,030
I'm sorry...

923
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,067
You useless buffoon.

924
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,594
You damn fool, what do you want?

925
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,098
I'm avenging the death of Chen Ping Fe.

926
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:53,101
- Huh?
- You die!

927
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,606
Who is Chen to you?

928
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,117
Huh. Damn child.

929
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,120
I'm going to get rid of you.

930
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,623
Not easily!

931
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,141
You bastard.

932
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,646
Get up.

933
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:40,648
Get up!

934
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,158
Now you're going to die.

935
01:28:50,193 --> 01:28:53,661
No matter. Steady.

936
01:28:56,164 --> 01:29:00,668
Ah. Steady. I must...

937
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,674
get my... second wind.

938
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,678
Now, steady.

939
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,683
Now, steady.

940
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,713
You are too late.

941
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,779
Huh?

942
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,286
Baby.

943
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,852
Huh!

944
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,370
Don't lean on me.

945
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,960
You were saying?

946
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,980
You're dead.

947
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:19,607
Grandpa.
