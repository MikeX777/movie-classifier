1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,960
There once was a story-teller
from Nantucket.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,240
Who kept all his tales in bucket.

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,560
Instead of that guy,
Now I'll be your guide.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,560
The coolest dragon
in the whole wide world.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,120
It doesn't really rhyme, does it?

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,000
There you are.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,920
Very well then.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,600
I will tell you a story
that might have never happened.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,560
But I swear all of it is true.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,560
After all, I, too, had my paw
in that pie, so to speak.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,120
All right.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,600
A long, long time ago...

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,760
...in a kingdom
far far away there lived a king.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,720
And his name was Allein III.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,920
Voila.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,800
It was during the 25th summer
since the Great Drought...

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,040
...that I bravely challenged...

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,480
...a fire-breathing dragon
to a fight,...

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,800
...single-handedly slaying
the beast...

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,560
...and saving my people.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,120
"A fire-breathing dragon,
and saving my people." Got it.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Your Majesty, do you think
one dragon is enough?

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,240
It doesn't sound that impressive.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,360
Make it five.
And each one had three heads.

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
You know what?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,680
Let's make it a nice round number
worthy of a king.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
Ten sounds much better.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,880
You're right, Your Majesty.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,240
Ten it'll be.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,360
Ten five-headed dragons then?

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,280
That's right.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,400
How could I forget that, huh?

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,760
ENCHANTED PRINCESS

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,360
<i>His Majesty Allein III</i>
<i>had three sons.</i>

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,880
<i>His youngest son, Evan,...</i>

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,240
<i>...was always busy</i>
<i>inventing something,...</i>

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,720
<i>...from spring-loaded stilts</i>
<i>to a hot air balloon.</i>

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,720
<i>At times, you wouldn't even guess</i>
<i>what he was fiddling with.</i>

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,400
Great.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
Hey, you.

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,960
-What is it you invented...
-There you go.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,720
...this time, Evan, huh?

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,120
Oh, I made a present.
It's for you, my brothers.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,000
A one-of-a-kind goatcycle.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,880
It won't move an inch.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,240
And you call yourself
an inventor?

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Trust me,
you couldn't be more wrong.

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,840
Hold on, I'll put my gear on.

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,760
<i>Two older brothers, however,</i>
<i>led the life of a royalty.</i>

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,600
<i>Day and night, they seemed</i>
<i>to be busy as a bee.</i>

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,800
-Giddy up
<i>-In other words,...</i>

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,160
<i>...they were</i>
<i>true public officials.</i>

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,880
Would you look at that?

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Help us!

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Don't twist the horns.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Evan, save us.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,120
I got you.

58
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,960
Or maybe not.

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,800
That is just great.
Thanks for the present, brother.

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,960
You know, I kind of liked it.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,880
Let's do it again tomorrow,
all right?

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,160
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>the neighboring kingdom...</i>

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,320
<i>...was ruled by another king,</i>
<i>Arrian IV.</i>

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
<i>And he had a daughter,</i>
<i>Princess Barbara,...</i>

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,360
<i>...who was known</i>
<i>for her unrivaled beauty.</i>

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
<i>As well as</i>
<i>for her unrivaled willfulness.</i>

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,160
<i>In a word,</i>
<i>she was a true princess.</i>

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,040
Barbara.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Daughter, where are you going?

70
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,760
We have a guest
from the Tulip Kingdom.

71
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
Prince George Frederick...

72
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Van...Van...Van...
Luther Beethoven something.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,320
Another one?

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Well, he will have to wait then.

75
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm testing new fuel
for my balloon.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Don't go. What if you crash?

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,880
Oh, please, Daddy. Trust me,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,040
Oh, dear.

79
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,960
What was I thinking when I bought
this stupid balloon for you...

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,320
...in the Faraway Kingdom?

81
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,680
Don't you worry, Daddy.
Everything will be fine.

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,320
What am I to do?

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
How can I restrain her?

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,560
Even as a little girl
she was nothing but trouble.

85
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,320
She'd be looking
for fern flower...

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,560
...or trying to find out
how deep the sea is.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,520
And now this.

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,200
A hot air balloon, huh?

89
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,960
I just want to see her
get married.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
I...

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,640
I want grandchildren.

92
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,760
Your Majesty,
it can't be that bad.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,280
All you need to do
is find a good match for her.

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,840
You know,
but where will I find one?

95
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,840
She brushes them all off.

96
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,040
You should use your authority.

97
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,320
Put your foot down.

98
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,240
What do you mean?

99
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,320
Put my foot down?

100
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,400
Like this.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,800
Oh, no, no, I cannot do that.

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,160
What?

103
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,520
Stop, hang on.

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,200
Hello there.

105
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,680
Would you please help me
unhook my balloon?

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,600
Hello?

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I...

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm coming.

109
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,080
You should have dropped
the ballast.

110
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
Whoa, thank you,
it's all my fault.

111
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,960
I lost control.

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,080
And forgot
about the power increase.

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,040
But it flies
a lot faster right now.

114
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,560
-Faster?
-Yes.

115
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
I used straw and wool as a fuel.

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,360
If you use wet straw,
hot air becomes humid,...

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
...and it has
a better lifting capacity.

118
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
I got to say that's a great idea.

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
But I was thinking
of filling my balloon...

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,400
...with marsh gas.

121
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,920
That could be even better,
you know?

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
You are quite an interesting man.

123
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
How do you know
about ballast or about marsh gas?

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
Who are you?

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,840
Well, I am...
I am Evan, prince Evan.

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,320
And I'm Barbara,...

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
...the princess
from the neighboring kingdom.

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,640
That's great.

129
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,840
I thought you were different.

130
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,920
No, you're all the same.

131
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,920
Bye, Evan.

132
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,160
Thanks for your help.

133
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
What a girl.

134
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,320
We were destined to meet.

135
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,960
After all, I was the one
who made that balloon.

136
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
And it brought her to me.

137
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,080
Into my arms.

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,160
Breaking news.

139
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,800
Princess Barbara
turned down yet another suitor.

140
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,040
Rejected prince is heartbroken.

141
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,400
Princess Barbara turned down...

142
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,080
I am no match for her.

143
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,240
I mean, even a foreign prince
wasn't good enough.

144
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,360
What is going on, my child?

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,080
You've turned down
at least a hundred princes.

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't exaggerate, daddy.

147
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
It was not a hundred.

148
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,760
A couple of dozens, maybe.

149
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
Or three dozens.

150
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Why are you like this?

151
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,560
All other princesses long
for their Prince Charming,...

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,360
...and when he shows up,
they live happily ever after.

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, I'm not like
other princesses.

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,000
None of them loves me, daddy.

155
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,920
They just like the way I look.

156
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,440
And when I smile, they
fall head over heels in love.

157
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,960
There you go. See?

158
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,360
Please, daddy, I just want
to be loved the way I am,...

159
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,000
...for my mind, for my soul,...

160
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
...for my thoughts and my dreams.

161
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
But, pumpkin,...

162
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,240
...you have to get married first,
and then, slowly but surely,...

163
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,360
...your husband
might take interest...

164
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,160
...in your thoughts and dreams,
and all those things.

165
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,000
Daddy. I'm done talking about it.

166
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,640
Look, the princess wants
to be loved the way she is?

167
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
She wants to be loved
for her thoughts and dreams?

168
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,000
Her wish is my command.

169
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,480
Wind, you're powerful and strong.

170
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,840
-You command the clouds along.
-Dragosha.

171
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
Are you messing up my bed again?

172
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,040
Yeah, I was just warming it up
for you.

173
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,200
So, I heard
you turned down another suitor?

174
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,800
Was he really all that bad?

175
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Are you not going to love anyone
in your life?

176
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,080
End up an old cat-lady?

177
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,440
I don't know.

178
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,800
I met one guy today.

179
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,840
He seemed to like me as a person.

180
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
Not just my looks.

181
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
But it turned out
to be the same old story.

182
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,560
Same old story?

183
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Eyes wide open
and just stands there drooling.

184
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,480
Just like every other prince.

185
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,960
I swear, sometimes
I just hate my own beauty.

186
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
Go look in the mirror,...

188
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,400
...you've got mud
all over your face.

189
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,360
Oh, you are right.

190
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
This is odd.

191
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,080
What was wrong with him then?

192
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
Yes. You may come in.

193
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,200
Your Highness, I have something
very important...

194
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
...to talk to you about.

195
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,680
What is it?

196
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I was afraid to tell you, but...

197
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,400
...I can no longer hide
my feelings.

198
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
Your Highness,...

199
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,800
...I am in love with you.

200
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,720
No, not because of your beauty.

201
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,840
Your looks are not
important to me...

202
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,160
...as I'm quite handsome myself.

203
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,160
And I can't help but admire
your thoughts and dreams.

204
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,080
Your mind, and your soul.

205
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,800
We are so much alike.

206
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,400
Your Highness.

207
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,240
Will you do me the honor
of being my wife?

208
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,640
You and me?

209
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,040
So much alike, huh?

210
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, I would beg to differ.

211
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,400
How dare you laugh at me?

212
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm sorry, advisor, but I...

213
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,480
I am not planning
on marrying anyone,...

214
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,960
...least of all, marrying you.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,280
You foolish insolent girl.

216
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm warning you...

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,080
...if you dare to reject me,
I will turn you into...

218
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
I will turn you...

219
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,760
Into what?

220
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,880
A dragon.

221
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,400
Dragosha.

222
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
This is one of
my most powerful spells.

223
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,880
It can only be lifted by someone
who can love you as a dragon.

224
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,520
And give you a true love's kiss.

225
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,800
But you can't tell anyone,
not even your father,...

226
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,520
...who you really are.

227
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,480
Or you will turn into ashes.

228
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,440
Oh, no. This is a nightmare.

229
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
What did he turn me into?

230
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,000
What am I going to do now?

231
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm so hungry.

232
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,800
What's that?

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,920
Wait, who is that?

234
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,680
A mighty beast.

235
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,840
<i>See the little birch</i>
<i>In the meadow</i>

236
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,840
<i>See the green birch</i>
<i>Growing in the meadow</i>

237
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,360
And this is how
my unparalleled valor...

238
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,840
...put an end
to the despicable enemy.

239
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,520
Have mercy, Your Majesty.

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,920
We come bearing terrible news.

241
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,520
Our kingdom
is facing a great threat.

242
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
There is no escape.

243
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,800
A certain death
is coming for us all.

244
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,960
We are all doomed, Your Majesty.

245
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,320
Stop banging
your heads against the floor.

246
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
You'll knock a hole in it.

247
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,920
Who will fix it then?

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,040
You won't, will you?

249
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
You've already broken
my door down.

250
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,920
Have mercy, Your Majesty.

251
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,080
Stop it, stop it. What is it?

252
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,880
Like we said,
we are all doomed.

253
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,040
Get to the point.

254
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,280
-We bear bad news.
-Just spill it anyway.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
Your Royal Majesty,...

256
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,120
...a huge dragon
has been sighted at our borders.

257
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,960
It is enormous in size
and spits fire all around.

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,200
It has burned down
five acres of forest.

259
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
And now it set
its eyes our lands.

260
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,080
Sound the alarm.

261
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,240
Quiet!

262
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,000
Where are my sons?

263
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,200
I want them here immediately.

264
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,520
The time has come for them
to protect our kingdom.

265
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,480
There you are.

266
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,680
All right then,
here's my royal decree.

267
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,600
You all will,
without further delay...

268
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,880
You got all that?

269
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,000
Without further delay.

270
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
...ride to our kingdom
borders,...

271
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,760
...locate the wicked beast
and slay it.

272
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
We need this selfless act...

273
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,840
...to bring further glory
to our royal kingdom.

274
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
You got that?

275
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,720
My dear father, I am always
ready to serve our kingdom.

276
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,880
And I solemnly swear I will find
and slay the wicked beast.

277
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,520
Good.

278
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
And what about the rest of you?

279
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,760
Your Majesty,...

280
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,880
...we think Evan will manage
to bring further glory...

281
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
...to our royal name on his own.

282
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,880
Yeah.

283
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,480
It's just not a good time for us.

284
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,280
We got so much stuff to do.

285
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,040
-Like, you know...
-No inheritance for you.

286
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,000
Fire.

287
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,840
<i>See the little birch</i>
<i>In the meadow</i>

288
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,240
<i>See the green birch growing</i>
<i>In the meadow.</i>

289
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,000
This beast couldn't pick
the worst time to show up.

290
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
We've got better things to do.

291
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,960
I couldn't agree more.

292
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,160
We have to risk our lives,
and for what? It's not fair.

293
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Well, I think it's wonderful.

294
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,880
A perfect chance
to prove our worth.

295
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,840
Yeah, right.

296
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,720
We have the chance,
we just don't have the time.

297
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,680
We're there.

298
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,240
Okay, Evan, you volunteered,
so you will have to go first.

299
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Now go and guard the bridge.

300
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,720
Yeah, while we take a nap.

301
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
That's exactly right.

302
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm so tired I can barely stand.

303
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,160
BORDER OUTPOST
OF THE FARAWAY KINGDOM

304
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
It's so beautiful.

305
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
Sometimes I wish I could fly.

306
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,360
<i>I see the brilliance of the moon</i>

307
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,360
<i>The flame inside my chest</i>
<i>Is burning</i>

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,120
<i>You came to me in the balloon</i>

309
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,440
<i>And now I rush to you, my darling</i>

310
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,680
Please, dad.

311
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,920
Just one more minute.

312
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,280
Why, you little...

313
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Come here, you...

314
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,960
That's it. You're dead.

315
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,960
Are they here for you?

316
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,520
No worries.

317
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,160
It's just like bowling.

318
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
I didn't mean it, actually.

319
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,120
Maybe you didn't.

320
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,480
But who cares anyway?

321
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,120
They are trespassers, and bam.

322
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,040
You stopped them.

323
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,440
You saved your kingdom.

324
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,720
Oh, yeah?

325
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,360
Who are you again?

326
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,480
The wicked beast?

327
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,320
Well, yeah.

328
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,480
I guess so.

329
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,160
-And who are you?
-I'm Evan.

330
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,760
-Prince Evan.
-Oh, that's right.

331
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,840
So why did you burn down
half our kingdom?

332
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,360
I didn't burn anything.

333
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Well, I did, just one tree,...

334
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,080
...but it was not
in your kingdom anyway.

335
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,080
It was there.

336
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,040
-Honest, I swear.
-Yeah?

337
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,800
And I thought you were...

338
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,880
The princess is missing.

339
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,160
What a tragedy.

340
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
What a nightmare.

341
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,160
The Neighboring Kingdom News.

342
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,840
Princess Barbara
has gone missing.

343
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
To whomever finds her,...

344
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,760
...the heartbroken king
has promised her...

345
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,000
...hand in marriage
and half the kingdom, as well.

346
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,680
The princess is missing.

347
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,400
<i>If he fell in love with me</i>
<i>when I was a princess,</i>...

348
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,600
...<i>maybe he can love me</i>
<i>as a dragon, too?</i>

349
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,800
<i>Anything is possible, right?</i>

350
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,800
Hey, Evan.

351
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,960
Where are you going?

352
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,720
To search for the princess?

353
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,200
Why don't you take me with you?

354
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
I promise,
I can help you find her.

355
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,920
Take me with you.

356
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,920
I will die here
without your help.

357
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,480
Let our fool of a brother...

358
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,960
...and that overgrown lizard
find the princess.

359
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
-We will follow them and...
-Wham, bam.

360
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,360
...then we'll see who gets
the princess...

361
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,680
...and who gets the kingdom.

362
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,560
You are right
as always my brother.

363
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,640
Evan?

364
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
-Evan?
-Yeah?

365
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,320
So where are we going
to look for her?

366
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,240
You are right.

367
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,400
Where should we start?

368
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,560
I'll tell you.

369
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,880
Where was she last seen?

370
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,080
In her kingdom?

371
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,440
I think so.

372
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, that means
that's where we should start.

373
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,400
You're right. They have a fair
going on right now.

374
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
A lot of people out there.

375
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,000
Maybe someone heard something.

376
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,800
FAIR. SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO.
NEIGHBORING KINGDOM.

377
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,360
Look at that.

378
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,240
Everyone's wearing costumes.

379
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
That's perfect.

380
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,840
They'll think you're
one of the actors...

381
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
...and won't get scared.

382
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
-Yeah, perfect.
-Lucky charms, love spells,...

383
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,240
...curses, and fortune-telling.

384
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,920
Princess-locating magic.

385
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,600
Excuse me.

386
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,160
What were you saying
about a princess?

387
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Why? Are you interested?

388
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,480
-Sure.
-Well, just for you.

389
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,080
A handmade map, one of a kind.

390
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,440
It will help you
find your princess.

391
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,800
It's not just a map, it's magic.

392
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,720
We are here.

393
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,200
And here's the tower where
the princess is locked up,...

394
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,760
-...waiting to be rescued.
-Let's go.

395
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,680
Hold on a second.

396
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
But it won't be easy
to get there.

397
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,320
No pavement for miles.

398
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,680
I can give you a nice discount.

399
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,120
Are we going or not?

400
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,720
I said, hold on.

401
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,480
Just for you
special, five gold coins.

402
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
But I don't have any money.

403
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,480
How about you give me the map,
and I'll pay you later, huh?

404
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,440
You're kidding me, right?

405
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,520
That was hilarious.

406
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,960
Well, do as you please.

407
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,640
It's a unique item,
it won't last long.

408
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,960
Ladies and gentlemen.

409
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,120
Boys and girls.

410
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
Only one performance.

411
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Try and beat
our invincible champion.

412
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,120
Don't even think about it.

413
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,560
You will never defeat him.

414
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,280
He will beat you to a pulp.

415
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,360
-We'll see about that.
-The winner gets five gold coins.

416
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,960
-Come on.
-No way. Hey, hold on.

417
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,360
Ladies and gentlemen.

418
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Our invincible champion
has won another fight.

419
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,720
Okay.

420
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,880
Is there anyone else...

421
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,960
...who'd like to challenge
our champion?

422
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,080
I would.

423
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,520
Okay, welcome.

424
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,080
Evan.

425
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,560
Ladies and gentlemen.

426
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,200
We have a winner.

427
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,360
Five gold coins
go to this young man.

428
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,440
You are
the new invincible champion.

429
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,120
I offer you a one-year contract.

430
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,480
For sure you'll be a millionaire.

431
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,040
No time for that.
I need to find the princess.

432
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,480
One, two, three, four, five.

433
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Now, this is
what I'm talking about.

434
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
Here's your
one-of-a-kind the map.

435
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,360
Good luck finding the princess.

436
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,160
Lucky charms,
love spells, and curses.

437
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,280
Seasonal discounts
all year round.

438
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,320
Now, where's the map?

439
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,120
Whoa, what map?

440
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,000
What are you talking about?

441
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,800
Lucky charms, fortune telling.

442
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Where's the princess map?

443
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,480
Oh, this..

444
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
That's a one-of-a-kind,
handmade item.

445
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,520
Just for you, five gold...

446
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,640
Get lost, you fool.

447
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,840
As you please.

448
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,160
Sure, sure.

449
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,960
Where could she be?

450
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,680
Dragosha is missing, too.

451
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,760
Have you searched the cellar?

452
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,600
Have you searched
the secret passage, as well?

453
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,600
I wonder
if it was something I said.

454
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,480
Maybe I was too hard on her.

455
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,680
I mean, she is so young,
after all.

456
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
She has plenty of time
to settle down.

457
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,280
And as for grandchildren.

458
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Well, I will wait
as long as it takes.

459
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,160
I just want to know where she is.

460
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,720
<i>Until they finally found</i>
<i>themselves who knows where.</i>

461
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,400
<i>Meanwhile, Evan and the princess</i>
<i>were crossing wide fields</i>...

462
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,520
Butterflies.

463
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
<i>...and climbing</i>
<i>the highest mountains</i>...

464
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,920
Well done.

465
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,800
<i>...and making their way</i>
<i>through the thickest woods.</i>

466
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,400
Are we there yet?

467
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm so tired,
and my feet hurt,...

468
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,000
-...my tail hurts.
-Stop whining, will you?

469
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,720
I have blisters on my feet.

470
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,120
So, where are we?

471
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,760
Wait. We'll see now.

472
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,080
Yep. We're who knows where.

473
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,880
-That's where.
-I should have guessed.

474
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,960
Where now?

475
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,120
We'll go straight ahead.

476
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,720
We'll make it
somewhere eventually.

477
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah, right.

478
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,720
So much for male logic.

479
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,920
Fantastic.

480
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,680
Evan.

481
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,440
Slow down.

482
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
-Will you slow down already.
-What now?

483
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,760
I'm so tired. I'm so hungry.

484
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm thirsty too. I'm sleepy.

485
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,480
Sleepy, thirsty, hungry.

486
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,320
Maybe you could make up
your mind.

487
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,680
You're acting
like a spoiled princess.

488
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,080
Hey, hey, you mister.

489
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,800
Hey, you, excuse me, hello there.

490
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
I'm sorry,...

491
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,920
-...but where are you taking us?
-To my house for the dinner.

492
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,720
The warrior will be
my first course,...

493
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,280
...and you, lizard, will make
the second one.

494
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,120
Why don't you wait here for now?

495
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,360
First, I need
to take a nap, all right?

496
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,880
To work up some appetite.

497
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,560
Hey, that rhymes.

498
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,640
That's a good one,
I need to remember that.

499
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,400
See, Evan?
Your map led us into trouble.

500
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,200
Why didn't you listen to me?

501
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,680
Now we'll be eaten
by some ugly ogre.

502
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,920
Stop pacing.

503
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,920
I can't think straight.

504
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,480
Do you even have
anything to think with?

505
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,440
Okay.

506
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,000
There must be a way out.

507
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,800
Hey, here's the idea,
you can breathe fire, can't you?

508
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,040
The bars will melt down,...

509
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,480
...we'll break them
and get out of here.

510
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,440
Breathe fire? No way.

511
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
-I get sick every time I do it.
-Oh, yeah?

512
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,600
So sick, you'd rather
be eaten alive by an ogre?

513
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,720
Quiet.

514
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,080
Well, hello there.

515
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,640
It's not my fault.

516
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,240
I told you,
breathing fire makes me sick.

517
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,520
It's okay.

518
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,200
At least we tried, right?

519
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,760
So was it worth, huh?

520
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,320
No one ever escaped from my cave.

521
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,920
Don't you understand,
you're doing it all wrong?

522
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,200
What? What do you mean?

523
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,640
You're breaking
the law of all ogres.

524
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,920
You have no right
to eat us just like that.

525
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,040
The law states, you have
to ask us three riddles first.

526
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,360
If we can't answer right,...

527
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,920
...then you can swallow us
right away.

528
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,920
But if we do,
you have to let us go.

529
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,960
And how do you know
about the law of all ogres?

530
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,040
I read it in a book once.

531
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,000
Well, you are right.

532
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,480
Okay, let's get it over with.

533
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,120
To answer, you have 30 seconds.

534
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,360
Riddle number one.

535
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,400
I am round, but...

536
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,480
...nothing can roll off me.

537
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,560
What am I?

538
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,960
The clock is ticking.

539
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,560
What can be round?

540
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,200
Tree stumps?

541
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,320
You are dumb as a stump.
What else?

542
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,360
-Barrels, apple pies?
-And nothing can roll off those?

543
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,880
Come on, think, Evan, think.

544
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,800
-Planets are round, too.
-That's right.

545
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,920
I have the answer.

546
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,160
It's our planet.

547
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,080
The Earth.

548
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,400
It's round,
but nothing ever rolls off it.

549
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,240
All right, you guessed that one.

550
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,440
Here's another riddle for you.

551
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,360
I am very easy to pick up.

552
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,120
But I am hard to throw far.

553
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,200
What am I?

554
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,880
You'll never guess that one.

555
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,840
Something easy to pick up.

556
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,200
Yeah, yeah, and hard to throw.

557
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,600
But why is it hard to throw?

558
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,040
-Because of the air resistance?
-Of course.

559
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,360
You time is up.

560
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,960
What is easy to pick up
but too hard to throw?

561
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,080
Feather. It's way too light,
so it just floats in the air.

562
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,120
Great, out of all people,
I get two highbrows.

563
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,280
All right then.

564
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,440
Here's my last
and my hardest riddle.

565
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,440
There are all kinds of stones
on the bottom of the sea.

566
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,840
Rubies, I don't know,
diamonds, emeralds, sapphires.

567
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,160
But what kind of stone
can never be found down there?

568
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,000
It doesn't make any sense.

569
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,160
All kinds of stones
can be found there.

570
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
All kinds of minerals.

571
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, this one
is truly difficult.

572
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,520
-There must be a catch.
-Well, think fast.

573
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,200
Or he'll have us for dinner.

574
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,280
Just a second.

575
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,880
I got it.

576
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,320
It's not about the stones,
it's about the sea.

577
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,680
There are all kinds of stones
on the bottom of the sea,...

578
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,480
...but you will never ever find
any dry stones down there,...

579
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,400
...am I right?

580
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,400
Fine then, you won.

581
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,760
Okay then, time to go.

582
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,040
-So long, ogre.
-Stop right there.

583
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,240
You're not going anywhere.

584
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,520
Even though the code of laws
of all ogres...

585
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,400
...says that I have
to let you go,...

586
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,640
...however...

587
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,240
...it does not say when.

588
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,160
I like the way
you cracked all my riddles.

589
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,080
You'll be
my personal entertainers now.

590
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,520
All right.

591
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,720
But this time we'll be the ones
asking you riddles.

592
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,080
Believe me, I know
all the riddles in the world.

593
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,320
Really? All right, then listen.

594
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,760
Two men come up to a river.

595
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,000
There's a boat by the bank
that can carry only one person.

596
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,600
But both of them
successfully get across.

597
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,000
The question is, how?

598
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,360
Wait a second.
Wait a second, I know this one.

599
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,160
-Lets go, let's go.
-Hold on.

600
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
I swear I know this one.

601
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,240
-We have to hurry up.
-Don't worry so much.

602
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,640
It'll take him at least two days
to find an answer.

603
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
I got it!

604
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
Go, go, go.

605
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,680
-Run, quick.
-Where are you going?

606
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,800
-I will kill you both!
-Run, quick.

607
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,240
Just hear once.

608
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
Come back!

609
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,320
You won't get away!
I'll show you!

610
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,040
Stop right there!

611
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,880
I can't see anything,
but I will find you all the same.

612
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,480
I know the answer.
They were on the opposite banks.

613
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,280
That's how they got across.
One after the other.

614
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,280
Well?

615
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,400
I am listening to you.

616
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,160
My Royal Yourjesty!
I mean, your Royal Majesty!

617
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,360
Anyway.

618
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Your sons have disappeared
and are nowhere to be found!

619
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,840
Disappeared how?

620
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,000
I would say, without a trace.
Meaning, they are gone.

621
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,240
-All three of them?
-Affirmative.

622
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,840
How could you let this happen?

623
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,160
Executioner!

624
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,720
Requesting permission
to be executed.

625
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,000
Stop!

626
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
We will immediately...

627
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,760
...form and send out
a search party!

628
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,080
I will personally be
in charge of the operation!

629
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,680
From here, from my office.

630
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,560
Well? What are you
waiting for? Scribe.

631
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
You stay here.

632
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,600
I got to have someone
to write down my strategic plan.

633
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,440
Well, where are we going?
There's nothing but trees here.

634
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,640
According to the map,...

635
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,040
...we just need
to follow this trail.

636
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
You rely on this map too much.

637
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,520
There's this rule, you know,...

638
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,080
...when in doubt,
read the friendly manual.

639
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,320
Does your manual say
how to save princesses too?

640
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,800
Evan! Wait!

641
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,920
What's wrong?

642
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,680
I just have a bad feeling.

643
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,400
What are you talking about?

644
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,080
Hello, kids.
I've been waiting for you.

645
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,560
Got you, dearies.

646
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,560
Welcome back.

647
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,520
You've got some pretty rad
whistling skills...

648
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,440
...for an old lady.

649
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,920
I am no old lady to you, boy!

650
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,680
I am the Witch of the Forest!

651
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,040
All of these woodlands
belong to me!

652
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,680
That's right.

653
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,440
Hey. Where's the dragon?

654
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880
Over there.
It's one of my exhibits now.

655
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,040
Excuse me?

656
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,720
Come, I'll show you.

657
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,600
Here it is.

658
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,760
My collection.

659
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,040
Magic sword.

660
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,960
Flying carpet.

661
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,840
Why would you hide these gems
from the world?

662
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,640
They just make me happy.

663
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,800
And I don't care
about the world, dear.

664
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,200
Here it is, my brand new item
on display.

665
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,800
A wild fire-breathing dragon.

666
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,400
Please, do not feed.

667
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,520
Set it free, witch.

668
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
And don't make me
say it twice. Now.

669
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,760
Whoa, take it easy, my boy.

670
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,080
Why would you need
this beast anyway?

671
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
You need to be on your way.

672
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,440
The princess
is not going to rescue herself.

673
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,400
I will not leave my friend.

674
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,240
Why do you have
to be so stubborn?

675
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
Well, I'm offering you
a deal then.

676
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,960
If you can get three magic items
for my collection,...

677
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,480
...I'll let you both go.

678
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,560
Otherwise, you both rot here.

679
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,080
And what kind of items
are we talking about?

680
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,440
Well, for starters,...

681
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
...bring me
the seven-league boots?

682
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,560
You'll find them on top
of the world's tallest pine,...

683
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,880
...unreachable for anyone.

684
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,600
Including you.

685
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,200
You know,
it's not as bad as I thought.

686
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,160
You know how to play?

687
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,800
Poker? Bridge?

688
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,920
What about dominoes?

689
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,280
Let's go play then,
while our hero's on his quest.

690
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,840
Okay, here we go.

691
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,200
Here we go.

692
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,800
Hey, get off me.
Annoying critter.

693
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,680
I won.

694
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,840
Sure did.
This is starting to get old.

695
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,680
You don't think
I can win it back?

696
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,720
Your boots,
just like you ordered.

697
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,640
Look at that, you got them.

698
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,720
Sure did.

699
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,840
-Please, save me.
-Don't cry.

700
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,480
-Don't cry you poor thing.
-I can't take it anymore.

701
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,400
Don't get excited too soon.

702
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,400
Your second task,
Evan, is even harder.

703
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,600
This time, you will have to go,
who knows where.

704
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,040
And then bring you
who knows what?

705
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,120
Not at all.

706
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,920
I want you to find
and bring me the Helper.

707
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,280
And who's that?
What does he look like?

708
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,920
No one knows.

709
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,520
No one has seen him before.

710
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,920
But he helps everyone
who needs it.

711
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,480
Well, here I am. Who knows where.
Now, where do I find this Helper?

712
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,640
Oh, I got it.

713
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,520
Greetings to the one whom
they call the Helper.

714
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,080
I don't know who you are,
but if you help people,...

715
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,840
...you must be a kind person.

716
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,960
If you are anywhere around here,
please break the bread with me.

717
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,960
Thank you.

718
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,400
It's been a while
since I had any bread.

719
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,920
So you are the Helper?

720
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,600
-Yes, I am. I am. I am.
-Could you be a little less loud?

721
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,000
Like this?

722
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,560
That's better.

723
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,760
Will you follow me
to the Witch of the Forest?

724
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,440
Well, since you helped me,
I'll help you, too. Let's go.

725
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,560
That was easy.

726
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,760
-Are you still here, Helper?
-Yes.

727
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,600
Help me. Someone, help.

728
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
I'm right here, Evan.

729
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,880
What's with you?
Is it raining outside?

730
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
Or just windy?

731
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,400
Neither. I've been looking
for your Helper.

732
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,560
-So? Did you find him?
-Of course.

733
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,560
Of course. Of course.
Of course.

734
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,560
What took you so long?

735
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,560
All right.
Here's your final challenge.

736
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,080
The Sea King
has a wonderful magic comb.

737
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,960
Whoever uses it,...

738
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,080
...immediately becomes
young and beautiful.

739
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,840
If you bring me the comb,
I'll let your dragon go.

740
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,040
Otherwise, I'll eat you both.

741
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,040
But the King lives
at the bottom of the sea.

742
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,320
How do I get there?

743
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,080
What?

744
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,960
If I knew that,
I would have visited him myself.

745
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,680
Why do you think
I'm asking you? You get it?

746
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,000
I get it.

747
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,120
All right.

748
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,040
If I can't go to the Sea King,
he'll have to come to me.

749
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,760
Hey! Who are you and
why are you muddying my waters?

750
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,560
Hello, Your Marine Majesty.

751
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,520
I am Evan, prince Evan.

752
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,800
I'm sorry I had
to disturb you, but...

753
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,400
...could you please let me
borrow your magic comb?

754
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,720
It's for a friend, you know?

755
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,840
Well, well.

756
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,480
Did the Witch
of the Forest send you?

757
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,480
That's right.

758
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,240
She's such a pesky old lady,
isn't she?

759
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,840
-Hey, Evan.
-Yeah?

760
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,920
You're not by any chance
tech-savvy, are you, my boy?

761
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,160
-Actually, I kind of do.
-Maybe you can help me out then.

762
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,760
I used to have
a unique music machine.

763
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,280
But it broke down.
Oh, wait. Wait, wait a second.

764
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,920
I have an idea.
I have a really awesome idea.

765
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,920
Now, give me the beat.

766
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,200
<i>I had a cool music machine</i>

767
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,000
<i>Real groovy</i>
<i>You know what I mean</i>

768
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,280
<i>It was entrancing</i>
<i>To watch my mermaids dancing</i>

769
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,120
<i>Now there's no one</i>
<i>On the dance floor</i>

770
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,200
<i>We can't party anymore</i>

771
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,280
Yep. That's pretty much it.

772
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,080
I got so bored, I even
started sinking ships again.

773
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,800
If you can fix my machine,
you can have the comb.

774
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,280
I'm sure I can fix it, but...

775
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,280
...how do I get to the sea bottom
without drowning?

776
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,440
Well, suit yourself.

777
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,280
All right, here goes nothing.

778
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,440
<i>Great.</i>

779
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,520
Okay.

780
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,240
What's up, Evan?
Something wrong?

781
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,160
Don't worry.

782
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,760
I can handle it.

783
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,280
No way. Here I am the king.

784
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,440
And spin you go.

785
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,040
They had it coming.

786
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,000
-Hey!
-The coast is clear.

787
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,840
Keep in touch, Evan.

788
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,960
In case my music machine
breaks down again.

789
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,040
Hasta la vista, baby.

790
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,840
What am I going to do with you?

791
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,920
Catch the rope, guys.

792
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,920
It's getting dark already.

793
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,800
Where is your friend, I wonder?

794
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,600
-Checkmate.
-What? Where?

795
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,040
Oh, you sneaky little lizard,
it really is a checkmate.

796
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,240
You know what?

797
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,560
Don't get excited too soon.

798
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,280
Where is your hero?
He's gone. Perished at sea.

799
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,760
Trust me, you will
never see him again.

800
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,600
Yay, Evan.
We've been waiting for you.

801
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,200
Oh yes, we have.

802
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,840
-So do you have it?
-I do.

803
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,880
Here you are, my magic comb.

804
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,240
You have to let
the dragon go now.

805
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,360
I have to, although
I really don't feel like it.

806
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,240
I like the creature,
it's fun to play with.

807
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Don't you worry.

808
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,840
I'll be visiting you.

809
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,000
-I doubt that.
-Goodbye.

810
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,120
Maybe you should stay the night

811
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,600
and leave in the morning?

812
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,240
Don't worry.
We can sleep in the forest.

813
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,640
We don't have much time.

814
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,080
We need to rescue the princess.

815
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,680
Well, off you go.

816
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
-One more thing, Evan.
-Yeah?

817
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,640
If you are ever in trouble,
turn the ring on your finger.

818
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,880
It's all right.
You will understand.

819
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,160
Tell me, Balthazar.
Where is my daughter?

820
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,160
We are still looking for her,
Your Majesty.

821
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,080
Our agents
leave no stone unturned.

822
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,560
I don't care about your agents!
I need my daughter!

823
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,760
I'll give you another day,...

824
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,840
...then..

825
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,080
...heads...

826
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,600
...will roll.

827
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,200
<i>Trapped behind bars</i>
<i>In dampness I dwell</i>

828
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,240
<i>I am a young-hearted dragon</i>
<i>Brought up in a cell</i>

829
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,120
Well? Dance.

830
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,840
Entertain me.

831
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,240
In your dreams.

832
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,320
Sit there for a while then.

833
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,280
And when your princess is tired
of wandering around,...

834
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,960
...she will get back to me.

835
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,600
No one will ever lift that spell.

836
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,160
So tell me, what
will you say to the princess,...

837
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,640
-...when you find her?
-What?

838
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,680
I guess I would say,
"Hey there, princess.

839
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,080
I am here to rescue you."

840
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
-And that's it?
-What else is there to say?

841
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,960
What about your feelings?

842
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,720
If you rescue her, it means
you got to propose to her.

843
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,040
What are you talking about?
I don't have feelings for her.

844
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,720
Why don't you wait here?

845
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,360
I'll take a look at what's ahead.

846
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,880
I see a tower.

847
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,560
Princess.

848
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,600
Hey, princess?

849
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,520
Princess?

850
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,800
Evan! What are you
doing up there?

851
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,720
You know, just...

852
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,240
...hanging.

853
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,200
We don't have time for this.

854
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,200
-Where's the princess?
-She's not here!

855
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,120
Who could have thought...?

856
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,440
Okay. I'll be down...

857
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,760
...in a minute.

858
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,360
Oh, no.

859
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,840
You know what?
You're not very gentleman-like.

860
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,280
That was crazy.

861
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,600
I didn't know you could fly.

862
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,520
Well, it kind of just happened.

863
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,320
Honestly, I was about to die.

864
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,160
My whole life
flashed before my eyes.

865
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,600
So thank you.

866
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,160
Oh, come on. You're welcome.

867
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,920
Run!

868
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,520
What?
Thinking about the princess?

869
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,920
Yeah.

870
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,200
Maybe someone else
already rescued her.

871
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,720
Come on, there's plenty
of fish in the sea.

872
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,480
What's so special about her?

873
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,880
I'm in love with her.

874
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,280
You're in love?

875
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,600
But you said
you had no feelings for her.

876
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,760
And how do you know?
You've only met her once. Oops.

877
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,960
But she...

878
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,480
She's just so...

879
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,960
...amazing.

880
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,520
Can you imagine?

881
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,120
She made my hot air balloon
flies so much faster...

882
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,720
...using wet straw as fuel.

883
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,160
I've never met such a smart girl.

884
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,520
But...

885
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,960
What about me?

886
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,960
Don't you care about me?

887
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,280
Nobody will ever love me!

888
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:14,680
Nobody will care for me!
I'm just a stupid dragon!

889
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,840
Hey, come on, stop crying.

890
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,880
Don't you know that
you are my best friend...

891
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,800
...forever and ever?

892
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,520
I will never leave your side.

893
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,880
As for me and the princess,...

894
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,960
...she may never
so much as look at me again.

895
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,440
But you and I,
we've been through so much.

896
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,200
<i>The spell can only be lifted</i>
<i>by someone</i>...

897
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,760
...<i>who can love you</i>
<i>as a dragon.</i>

898
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,560
<i>And give you a true love's kiss.</i>

899
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,200
Princess?

900
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,920
Princess!

901
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,080
Look, brother. It's the princess.

902
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,680
I can see.

903
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,640
Let's get them both.

904
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,600
Balthazar the Sorcerer
put a spell on me,...

905
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,600
...and you, you rescued me.

906
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,840
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing?

907
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,040
What's got into you?
We are brothers.

908
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,320
I'm sorry, brother,
but we've had enough of you.

909
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,760
We've been chasing you
on that stupid goat for too long.

910
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,320
So true, bro. Let's get her.

911
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,880
Let me go!

912
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,760
I'll tell my dad all about you!

913
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,000
Go ahead, tell him,...

914
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,520
...don't forget the part
where you were a dragon.

915
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,880
And we'll tell him
we found you in the woods.

916
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,160
And you were so scared
you lost your mind.

917
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,200
What are we going to do
about Evan?

918
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,440
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

919
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,160
Bye-bye, Evan!

920
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,640
Goodbye, brother.
No hard feelings.

921
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,840
Now, this is a sticky situation.
And I didn't rescue the princess.

922
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,440
And now I never will.

923
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,440
Not you again.

924
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,960
Over there! Over there!

925
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,280
Okay.

926
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,200
Prepare for landing.

927
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,640
Oh, just wait
till I get to you two.

928
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,040
Well...

929
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,840
...I was just wondering...

930
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,520
...why there was
a thunder and lightning...

931
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,560
...on such a splendid clear day.

932
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,480
Your evil plan
has failed, Balthazar!

933
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,360
Evan has lifted the spell.

934
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,960
And he really loves me
the way I am.

935
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,600
Yes. That's unfortunate.

936
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,120
Who are you, anyway?

937
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,040
-It's time to get lost, grandpa.
-Or else.

938
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,080
Hey, what are you doing?

939
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,000
Now, what should I do with you?

940
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,440
All right.

941
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,960
I'll think of something.

942
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,960
So that's him,
Balthazar the sorcerer.

943
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,120
Looks like his ring
is the source of his magic.

944
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,360
If I take the ring away,
he should become powerless.

945
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,240
Hang on, Barbara, I'm on my way.

946
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,240
Who are you?

947
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,920
It's all just a dream.

948
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,920
My ring.

949
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,920
Give it back.

950
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,720
No way.

951
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,120
Who are you?

952
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,640
I'm Evan, prince Evan.
And you, Balthazar, are done for.

953
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Take that.

954
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,520
-Helper, Helper, Helper.
-Give me the ring.

955
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,280
I'm here, Evan!

956
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,160
What's going on?

957
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,920
-Who are you?
-Hurry up.

958
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,840
Thank you.

959
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,840
I can't hold him much longer.

960
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,200
I'll show you.

961
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,200
Why isn't it working?

962
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,160
What's wrong, Evan?
Can't make it work?

963
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,320
-Can't figure out the ring?
-If you are ever in trouble,...

964
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,400
...turn the ring on your finger.

965
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,520
What? Wait. What?
Stop it, I feel dizzy.

966
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,120
Please, stop it right now.

967
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,280
No! I'm afraid of heights!

968
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,880
-Dragosha!
-My princess!

969
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,520
-My little girl!
-Daddy!

970
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,560
-I missed you.
-Our princess is back.

971
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,560
-Our princess is back.
-She's home at last.

972
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,160
Everyone, come.
Now it's time to celebrate!

973
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,640
You'd better
get out of here, brothers.

974
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,480
Or I'll...

975
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,520
...turn you into toads.

976
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,080
-Evan!
-What?

977
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,000
Where do you think you're going?

978
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,920
You want to leave me
just like that?

979
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,040
I thought I was your best friend.

980
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,240
I thought
you'd never leave my side.

981
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,520
I'm not sure
if it was a good kiss.

982
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,320
It's hard to tell
since it's my first one.

983
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,480
But you know what?

984
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,640
Now you, being an honest prince,
just have to marry me.

985
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,320
Will you marry me?

986
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,760
Yeah.

987
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,920
Breaking news! Breaking news!

988
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,720
Princess Barbara
is getting married!

989
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,320
<i>The day when I became</i>
<i>An awful dragon girl</i>

990
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:42,840
<i>You did not know</i>
<i>You would be my best friend</i>

991
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,120
<i>Even though I'm breathing fire</i>
<i>From my mouth</i>

992
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:53,880
<i>We are walking</i>
<i>Through the troubles hand by hand</i>

993
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,400
<i>The world appeared to us</i>
<i>And it became a dream</i>

994
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,160
<i>We have found the happiness</i>
<i>The joy and love in it</i>

995
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,800
<i>Even though it seemed</i>
<i>There was a hopeless time</i>

996
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,760
<i>We followed to the answer</i>
<i>With the loving light</i>

997
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:21,880
<i>The Ogre was overcome</i>
<i>All money for the map</i>

998
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:27,760
<i>You figured out the puzzles</i>
<i>Of the Giant my friend</i>

999
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:33,240
<i>And he rescued me</i>
<i>From the evil's way</i>

1000
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:39,400
<i>My hero's getting close to me</i>
<i>From day to day</i>

1001
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,920
<i>You were running</i>
<i>Like a vortex trough my life</i>

1002
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,880
<i>I did not believe</i>
<i>In a power of love</i>

1003
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,760
<i>And it doesn't matter</i>
<i>You were dragon girl</i>

1004
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:01,360
<i>I felt the dragon turns</i>
<i>Into the angel wow</i>

1005
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,600
<i>You can find the magic world</i>

1006
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,640
<i>Is full of miracles at all</i>

1007
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:12,320
<i>You can feel the kindliness</i>
<i>From the beaver on this land</i>

1008
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,920
<i>Let the fairytales come true</i>
<i>The whole wide world</i>

1009
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,600
<i>And it fills the towns, the seas</i>

1010
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,680
<i>The mountains and the fields</i>

1011
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:40,440
<i>Let the fairytales come true</i>
<i>The whole wide world</i>

1012
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:46,520
<i>And it fills the towns, the seas</i>
<i>The mountains and the fields</i>

1013
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,320
<i>We wish you to travel far away</i>

1014
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:57,480
<i>In the world of fairytales</i>

1015
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,600
<i>We wish you to travel far away</i>

1016
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,120
<i>In the world of fairytales</i>

1017
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,040
Well, I am...

1018
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,800
Please, daddy, I just want to be
loved the way I am.

1019
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,200
Oh, no.

1020
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,920
This is a nightmare.
What did he turn me into?

1021
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,440
Your looks
are not important to me...

1022
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,680
...as I'm quite handsome myself.

1023
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,360
Great, out of all people,
I get two highbrows.

1024
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,280
I am the old lady, to you boy?

1025
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,760
I am the Witch of the Forest.

1026
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,360
How could you let this happen?
Executioner!

1027
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,880
<i>Trapped behind bars</i>
<i>In dampness I dwell</i>

1028
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,040
<i>I am a young-hearted dragon</i>
<i>Brought up in a cell</i>

1029
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,480
That's just great.
Thanks for the present, brother.

1030
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,200
I kind of liked it.

1031
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,400
Fire!

1032
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,680
How long do we have to dig here?

1033
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,600
Dad said our punishment
is to dig a tunnel...

1034
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,520
...until we get to
the other end of the Earth,...

1035
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,440
...you know.

1036
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,600
Hey, look, I think
I found something strange here.

1037
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:51,960
What is it?

1038
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,240
Looks like a chest or something.

1039
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,040
All chained up.

1040
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,760
But what do you think is inside?

1041
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,840
There's a bear inside that chest.

1042
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,840
In that bear, there is a hare.

1043
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,680
In that hare, there's a duck.

1044
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,440
In that duck, there's an egg.

1045
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,040
In that egg, there's a needle.

1046
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,440
In that needle, there's death.

1047
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,760
And whose death is it? Huh?

1048
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,880
Don't you know? Everyone knows.

1049
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,440
But I don't remember.

1050
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,800
-Oh, great! Just great!
-Stop.

1051
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,160
I remember.

1052
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,160
There's no way.

1053
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,920
What? Beavers?

1054
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,800
What's up?

1055
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,280
What do you want from me?

1056
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,120
Leave me alone!
