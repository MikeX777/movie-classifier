1
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,751
Possum, put that up, now.

2
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,197
Our Heavenly Father...

3
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,172
...bless this meal and those
who are about to receive it.

4
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,644
Make us thankful for your generous
bounty and your unceasing love.

5
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,414
Please remind us,
in these hard times...

6
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,712
...to be grateful for what
we have been given...

7
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,654
...and not to ask for what
we cannot have.

8
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,489
And make us mindful of those
less fortunate among us...

9
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,789
...as we sit at this table
with all of thy bounty.

10
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,724
- Amen.
- Amen.

11
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,197
Turn your plate over.

12
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,637
Put your napkin in your lap.

13
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,944
Frank, you want to take some...

14
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,805
- okra and pass it to your pa?

15
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:34,877
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,213
Forgot to tell you, we got a letter
from your Aunt Gladys.

17
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:43,153
She was hoping we could come
to Oklahoma and visit them...

18
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,221
...during your vacation.

19
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,088
But, I don't know.
I was hoping we could paint the house.

20
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,031
I'll get it.

21
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,467
Thank you.

22
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,463
- Frank, one biscuit.
- Yes, ma'am.

23
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,167
Right on my biscuit.

24
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,640
Excuse me, Mrs. Spalding.
The sheriff home?

25
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,112
He is, but we just sat down to
dinner. Can't this wait?

26
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,841
No, ma'am. It seems like we
got a problem down...

27
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,418
It's all right!
I'll be right there, Jack!

28
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,388
Sorry to bother you, sheriff, but
there's a drunk Negro by the track.

29
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,924
- I thought you ought to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,975
- Where are you going?
- With Pa.

31
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,040
Royce?

32
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,677
No one excused you from the table,
young man. You stay here.

33
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,380
I won't be gone long.

34
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,450
- Who'd you say it was?
- That Wylie boy, sheriff...

35
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,711
Hey, boys, get on back now,
you hear me? You hear?

36
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,877
Wylie!

37
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,613
Wylie!

38
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,328
Howdy, Mr. Royce.

39
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,791
Nice day.

40
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,294
Wylie, you're drunk as a skunk.

41
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,970
I sure am, Mr. Royce.

42
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,469
You know better than that.

43
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,207
I'm sorry, Mr. Royce.

44
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,867
- You ready to come with me now?
- Just a minute.

45
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,149
Wylie, are you done?

46
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,844
Royce...

47
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,973
Frank!

48
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,142
Frank!

49
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,905
Frank, give me my doll!

50
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,818
Frank. Possum.

51
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,621
- Give me my doll!
- Frank. Possum.

52
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,352
Come here.

53
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,595
Come on.

54
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,303
Something's happened to your pa.

55
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,437
- What do you think?
- Get her out here.

56
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,832
Ma?

57
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,704
Ma?

58
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,101
Never you mind, hon.
Don't you look.

59
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,354
Come on.

60
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,717
For pity's sake, what do you
think you're doing?

61
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,630
You get out of here. Right now.

62
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,429
- Right now, Glen. I mean it.
- Guess we can go now.

63
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,468
Oh, sis.

64
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,845
Rosalie, you go down.

65
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,915
Go inside, both of you.

66
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,213
Oh, sis.

67
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,854
Sis, I'm so sorry.

68
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,418
I am so sorry.

69
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,359
I don't want anybody to see me.

70
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:55,398
- I don't want anybody to see me.
- I'm not gonna let anybody see you.

71
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,464
Nobody's gonna see you.

72
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:14,177
We would have been married 15 years
this October.

73
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,152
We had two children.

74
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,827
And I never knew till just now
Royce had a scar right there.

75
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,869
I never knew that.

76
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,942
I was afrai...

77
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,518
I was afraid you wasn't
gonna make it.

78
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,838
Just don't worry about anything.

79
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,270
Darling, I'm sorry.

80
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,537
I just heard.
I got here as fast as I could.

81
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,874
You all right? Come here.
It's all right.

82
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,640
It's all right.

83
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,854
Oh, honey, everything's gonna
be all right.

84
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,858
I'm here now.

85
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,258
I know how bad you feel.

86
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,363
There now, there now. I'm sorry.

87
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,767
All I could think of...

88
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,934
...when I saw that poor man
in there...

89
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,640
...was what would I do if it was you?

90
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,243
What would I do if something was
to happen to you?

91
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,649
Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

92
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,990
I'm too ornery.

93
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,960
I don't think I could live
without you.

94
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,131
Oh, I love you.

95
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,002
I love you so much.

96
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,935
I love you too.

97
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,890
Sorry to hear about it.

98
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,752
Thank you. We appreciate it.

99
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,628
- Wayne.
- Viola.

100
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,132
- Where's Edna?
- She's in the kitchen with Margaret.

101
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,204
All right.

102
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,196
Hi, Buddy.

103
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,773
Hello, Wayne. How you doing?

104
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,310
- How's Mrs. Spalding?
- She's all right.

105
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,846
Excuse me.

106
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,221
Vi...

107
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,552
You want to take this for a minute?
I'll be right back.

108
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,303
Here, sug.

109
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,743
Come on, you gotta eat something.

110
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,720
Marie Thornton made that.

111
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,058
It's real good.

112
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,200
Margaret.

113
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,768
What's gonna happen to us?

114
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,677
I can't support this family.

115
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,619
I haven't the least idea
how to go about it.

116
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,785
It seems...

117
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,990
...like I have never done anything
all my life...

118
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,129
...but raise kids...

119
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,002
...and take care of this house.

120
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,176
Royce paid all the bills.

121
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,678
I never even knew how much
salary he made.

122
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,592
What's gonna happen to us?

123
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,482
And thou shalt eat
the herbs of the field.

124
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,286
In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread...

125
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,896
...till thou return unto the ground...

126
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,698
...for out of it wast thou taken.

127
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,801
For dust thou art...

128
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,837
...and unto dust thou shall return.

129
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,437
Amen.

130
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,894
Lord, I thought those people
would never leave.

131
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,035
- Margaret, let me get this now.
- No, you go on and rest.

132
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,635
I'll get that.

133
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,611
Evening, ma'am.

134
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,407
Excuse me, but I was wondering if
you have any work around here?

135
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,241
No. There's nothing here.

136
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,081
You go on now. Shoo.

137
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,853
What is it?

138
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,220
I was just asking if you had any
chores I can help with.

139
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,657
Oh, no, there's no work around here.

140
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,093
I can make you a plate of food.

141
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,399
Thank you, ma'am.

142
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,496
You wait out by the gate.

143
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:25,635
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,707
Excuse me!

145
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,750
Morning!

146
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,285
I thought I told you last night
you can't stay around here.

147
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,651
Well, I seen you was almost
out of firewood...

148
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,886
...so I thought I'd chop some for you.

149
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,527
I could fix you some breakfast,
but after that, you got to go.

150
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,330
Thank you, ma'am.

151
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,539
You know, ma'am...

152
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,584
...you got a nice henhouse over here.

153
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,848
Of course, it's about ready
to fall down.

154
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,124
A mighty good-looking milk cow.

155
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,230
She sure need taking care of, though.

156
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,129
There must be close to 40 acres
out back.

157
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,296
I reckon with the right
kind of help...

158
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,739
...you'd make yourself a handsome
living just farming cotton.

159
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,213
All you need is somebody like me...

160
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,077
...who knows most everything there is
to know about farming cotton.

161
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,053
I was thinking that maybe...

162
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,553
...I could work around here for food
and a place to stay.

163
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,191
No. I can't give you any work.

164
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,385
I could fix you some breakfast,
and then you've got to leave.

165
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,765
- No such thing as a job, nowadays.
- I'm sorry.

166
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,496
I'll fix you a nice plate of food.

167
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,437
You go wait out there and I'll
bring it to you, okay?

168
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,041
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:57,879
I can mend this fence with no
trouble at all, right after breakfast.

170
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,891
Oh, that'd be fine, just fine.

171
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,793
Okay. I'll be right out here.

172
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,350
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.

173
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,819
Mr. Denby.

174
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,391
I hope I'm not bothering you.

175
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,757
- No. Won't you come in?
- Oh, thank you.

176
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,600
- Please.
- Thank you.

177
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:52,739
Mrs. Spalding, on behalf of everyone
down at the First Farmers Bank...

178
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:57,040
...if there's anything we can do in
this hour of need, please ask.

179
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,477
Thank you.

180
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,445
Mrs. Spalding...

181
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,612
...I don't know how much your husband
told you about his business.

182
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,358
But at the close
of banking hours yesterday...

183
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,998
...you had a balance of $116.72.

184
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,858
However, when your husband
bought this place...

185
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,537
...he did borrow money from the bank.

186
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,067
At the time of his death
he still owed...

187
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:28,144
...$3681, to be paid twice a year.

188
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,542
What that means, Mrs. Spalding, is...

189
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,017
...come October 15th, you will owe
the bank $240.

190
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:41,556
We were wondering if you had any idea
how you were gonna make that payment.

191
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,021
Yes.

192
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,855
Matter of fact, I do.

193
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,463
I was thinking...

194
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,866
Rilla Langsford and her sister
have that nice little gift shop...

195
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,835
...and, well, I thought I could
do the same thing.

196
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,374
I could get some pretty little
things, and I could set them out...

197
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,911
Mrs. Spalding, why would someone
come all the way out here...

198
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,811
...when the Langsfords' place
is there on the square?

199
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,251
Oh.

200
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:12,514
Mrs. Spalding, what we at the bank
suggest is that you sell this place.

201
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,692
Now I know times are hard...

202
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:19,830
...but maybe we can pay off the loan
and have something to tide you over.

203
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,395
But where would we live?

204
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,434
I believe you have a sister
that resides here.

205
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,198
No, Margaret couldn't take us in.

206
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,172
She couldn't afford it, and
besides, she hasn't got room.

207
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,403
Mrs. Spalding, when tragedies
like this happen...

208
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:40,008
...sometimes we have to face up to
things that are real hard.

209
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:46,081
Sometimes it's necessary to split
families up, temporarily.

210
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,454
I believe your husband has
some family up in Oklahoma.

211
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,255
I'm sure they could take one
of your children.

212
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,125
I can't talk about this right now.

213
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,597
If you'll excuse me,
you can let yourself out.

214
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,672
I think that just about
does the trick.

215
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,236
That'll be...

216
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,137
...75 cents.

217
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,479
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

218
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,744
Right. Thank you, Ruby.

219
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,382
I didn't know you were busy.

220
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,058
That's all right.
I was just leaving.

221
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,385
- Bye, Ruby.
- Bye-bye.

222
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,255
- Kids, come on in.
- Hi, Aunt Margaret.

223
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,862
Don't touch anything, Possum.

224
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,658
Watch your sister.
Don't let her touch anything.

225
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:33,031
Mrs. Parks offered to buy five pounds
of tomatoes from us.

226
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,638
So we thought we'd come by
and say hello.

227
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,168
Where's Rosalie?

228
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,935
I'm sorry. She's gone off
with her daddy.

229
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,037
But if you go in the kitchen,
I got some Coca-Cola in the icebox.

230
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,513
- Can we, Mommy?
- Yeah, you can.

231
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,081
- Frank, split one with your sister.
- Okay, Mom!

232
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,280
It's all right.
You can each have one.

233
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,018
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Aunt Margaret.

234
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,446
Margaret, I've been thinking.

235
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,343
Maybe I could work for you.

236
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,820
I don't know much about this
work, but I could learn.

237
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,959
I'm a real good worker.

238
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,793
Oh, hon.

239
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,496
I hardly got enough customers these
days to support me and Wayne.

240
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,473
I understand, Margaret.
Don't you even think about it.

241
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,904
Kids, come on. We got to go.
It's getting dark.

242
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,305
- Here, I got $28 saved.
- I don't want that.

243
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,504
Take it. Wayne will just
spend it on some fool thing.

244
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,410
I don't need it.

245
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,141
Come on, kids!

246
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,185
- Bye, Aunt Margaret.
- Goodbye, Aunt Margaret.

247
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,916
I swear you are just like Daddy.

248
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,322
You'd think he was sawing off his
leg to ask for the least thing.

249
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,496
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

250
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,852
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

251
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,292
We caught this nigger with a bunch
of things I think might belong to you.

252
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,789
Found him down by the tracks.

253
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,627
He claimed he was working for you...

254
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,894
...but it looks like he was
leaving town.

255
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,070
No, he's working for me.

256
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,174
I needed somebody to help out around
here, and so I took on...

257
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,279
Moses. Moses Hadnot.

258
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,542
I took on Moses to do some chores
until I could get straightened away.

259
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,344
Mrs. Spalding, are you sure?

260
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,715
I mean, I found
all that silver on him.

261
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,251
Oh, it's Mama's, and Margaret
wanted to borrow it.

262
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,454
If you had gone straight there and
back, you wouldn't have this trouble.

263
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,654
Yes'm.

264
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,898
Mrs. Spalding, are you sure
you're all right?

265
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,468
Well...

266
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,704
...good night.

267
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,306
Good night, Jack.

268
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,825
Ma'am, I appreciate what
you've done...

269
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,294
How much could I make
if I was to plant cotton?

270
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,625
Cotton?

271
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,831
Well, last year cotton fetched
six cents a pound.

272
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,972
You got, say, 30 acres here,
you figure...

273
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,904
That's 300 and some dollars.
If you take out...

274
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,770
You sure you can do it?

275
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,037
Ma'am, I been chopping cotton since
I was 5 years old.

276
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,375
I know all there is to know
about cotton.

277
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,552
All right, you stay in
the shed beside the barn.

278
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,416
Ma'am, I wanted to say
that I appreciate...

279
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,957
If you ever steal from
me again, I'll shoot you myself.

280
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,492
You understand that?

281
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,236
Thank you. See you next week.

282
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,777
Good to see you.

283
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,546
- Good morning, Mrs. Spalding.
- Thanks.

284
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:44,183
Hello, Mrs. Spalding.
It's nice to see you again so soon.

285
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,755
Won't you come right in here?

286
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,655
Why don't you take a seat
right over there?

287
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,241
Mr. Denby...

288
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,036
...I was wondering if you would...

289
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,372
...show me how to fill out a check?

290
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,948
I never did it before,
and I'd best learn how.

291
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:17,588
Certainly, Mrs. Spalding. It's just
the simplest thing in the world.

292
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,247
Now up here, this is where
you put the date.

293
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,222
Mr. Denby...

294
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,421
...I'm thinking it won't be necessary
for me to sell my farm after all.

295
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:31,728
Of course it's necessary.
I explained all that to you yesterday.

296
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,131
- Down here...
- I was thinking...

297
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,102
...if I was to plant cotton...

298
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,299
Mrs. Spalding, you don't know
a thing about cotton farming.

299
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,912
- Yes, I know, but Moses says...
- Moses? Who's Moses?

300
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,081
He's this Negro man.

301
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,149
I don't know any Negro
around here named Moses.

302
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,913
He was just passing through, and I
gave him a job doing some chores.

303
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:56,059
You're telling me you let some Negro
hobo talk you into planting cotton?

304
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,729
Did you ever hear of the Depression?

305
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,723
Now...

306
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,561
...you see these?

307
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,335
These are all foreclosures. And
that's just in the last three months.

308
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:12,101
White men who've cotton-farmed all
their lives and can't make a go of it.

309
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,907
And you listening to some
no-account nigger.

310
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,308
You'll excuse me, Mrs. Spalding...

311
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,575
...but that's just about the most
ignorant thing I've ever heard.

312
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,085
Mr. Denby...

313
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,119
...I'm not ignorant...

314
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,883
...and I'm not selling my land.

315
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:32,552
And I'm not giving my children over
to anyone else to raise.

316
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:37,565
I'm going out and I'm buying
$15 worth of cottonseed.

317
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,762
So I'd appreciate it if you would
show me again how to write a check.

318
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,908
Okay, Mrs. Spalding, that's...

319
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,978
Let's see, 450 pound of cottonseed
at .03 cent a pound.

320
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,517
That comes to...

321
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,920
...$13.50.

322
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,319
- $13.50?
- Yes, ma'am.

323
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,154
Load up Mrs. Spalding's wagon.

324
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,125
- Miz Spalding?
- Yes.

325
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,623
That ain't the seed you're paying for.

326
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:13,293
He's charging you for grade-A seed,
but that's gin-run quality.

327
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,270
Something wrong, ma'am?

328
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:21,507
Mr. Simmons, I think maybe you
gave us the wrong seed?

329
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,609
Well, so I did.

330
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,411
That's just an honest mistake,
isn't it, boy?

331
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,853
Isn't it, boy?

332
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,387
Yes, sir.

333
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,159
Now you idiots gave Mrs. Spalding
the wrong seed.

334
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,425
We're lucky her nigger caught it.

335
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,399
That's a smart nigger you got there.
He's a credit to his race.

336
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:57,103
Why did you have to go shoot off your
big mouth in front of that white man?

337
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,114
I swear, you ain't never
gonna learn nothing.

338
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,611
You just got yourself into
a carload of trouble.

339
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,690
This ain't your land.
You just passing through.

340
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,656
That white woman ain't nothing to you.

341
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:15,029
These people ain't no reason to get
yourself killed.

342
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,460
Howdy.

343
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,865
Howdy.

344
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,102
What's your name?

345
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,033
Moses.

346
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,745
My name's Frank.

347
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,817
- My pa was killed.
- I heard about it. I'm sure sorry.

348
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,255
He was shot.

349
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,786
It was a nigger killed him.

350
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,669
How old are you, child?

351
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,681
Nine, and 4 months.

352
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,013
You mean to tell me you got to be
9 years and 4 months old...

353
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,346
...and nobody told you
it's bad luck...

354
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,750
...to rock a rocking chair
with nobody in it?

355
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,452
Don't do no good now.
The damage is done.

356
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,058
I knew a man who rocked
a empty rocking chair.

357
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,461
Before nightfall, he got run
over by a cotton wagon.

358
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,336
Here, take this rabbit foot.

359
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,532
And you do what I do and
say what I say, you understand?

360
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,270
First thing is you turn around
three times.

361
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,209
One...

362
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,383
...two...

363
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,710
...three.

364
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:45,178
Next thing is you walk backwards.
Seven, six...

365
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,220
...five...

366
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,254
...four...

367
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,390
...three...

368
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,356
...two, one.

369
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,051
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!

370
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,458
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!

371
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,397
Give back my rabbit foot.

372
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,594
Got too much to do around here to go
around saving your life all the time.

373
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,776
If you're just gonna stand around,
you might as well be of some use.

374
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,176
Fetch me some of them nails
over there.

375
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,354
What are you thinking about?

376
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,534
I grew up in a place just like this.

377
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,200
Boy, I hated it.

378
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,373
I used to run away every chance I got.

379
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,869
I'd sneak out of the house...

380
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,913
...go out behind the barn.

381
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,815
Then I'd...

382
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:54,018
...head out across the pasture and
down to this grove of elm trees.

383
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,824
And right in the middle...

384
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:02,295
...was this little spot where I
used to go and sit all the time.

385
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,781
Hello!

386
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,852
Watch your step here.

387
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,390
And another one.
And a little step up.

388
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,724
Mrs. Spalding?

389
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,032
Yes, Mr. Denby,
I'm in the back yard!

390
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,965
I'll be right there.

391
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,305
Now put that thing away.

392
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,379
This woman may not like people
smoking in her house.

393
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,847
Now, please, for once in your life,
try and make a good impression.

394
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,620
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.
How are you?

395
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,957
I'm just fine.

396
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,563
I don't believe you know my
brother-in-law, Will.

397
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,227
How do you do?

398
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,464
Mind if we come in?

399
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,842
No. No, not at all.

400
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,546
Poor Will, here, lost his sight
in the big war.

401
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,381
It was the Battle of the Somme,
wasn't it, Will?

402
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,092
He was a real war hero.
Weren't you, Will?

403
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,994
Will, he doesn't like to talk
about these things too much.

404
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,900
- Do you, Will?
- No.

405
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,768
Will's been living with his mama
until she passed away...

406
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,535
...and since that time he's been
visiting with my wife and me.

407
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,275
Now then, Mrs. Spalding...

408
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,007
...in spite of the fact
that I have great doubts about...

409
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,086
...this misguided attempt of yours
to hold on to this place...

410
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:08,315
...as a Christian and deacon of the
church, it's my beholden duty to...

411
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,620
...reach out the hand of charity to
a human being in need.

412
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,993
And I got to thinking, now what better
way to help out this poor woman...

413
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,395
...than if she took in a boarder.

414
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:23,472
Someone who could move in here, and by
paying a modest rent, help her out.

415
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:28,776
What if my brother-in-law was to
move in here and rent a room from you?

416
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,810
Move in here?

417
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:34,314
Will makes a living caning chairs
and making brooms, so don't you worry.

418
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:41,153
Oh, Mr. Denby, I'm...

419
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,153
I so appreciate your thoughtfulness.

420
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,335
This just isn't a good time.

421
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,670
Sit down, Will.

422
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,767
Will?

423
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,543
Mrs. Spalding...

424
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,515
...speaking on behalf of the bank...

425
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:18,093
...we'd take it as a sign that you're
trying to provide for your family.

426
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,195
When would you like
your brother-in-law to move in?

427
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:28,330
As a matter of fact, I have his things
out in the car right now.

428
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,714
Anything special you like to eat?

429
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,412
I'm not a very good cook,
but I'm willing to try.

430
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:52,460
I don't want me to be here any more
than you do. I won't be any trouble.

431
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,656
And all I'll ask in return is to be
left alone in peace and quiet.

432
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,630
- I thought...
- I know what you thought.

433
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:03,068
But I don't need your help, and I
don't need you to feel sorry for me.

434
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,259
Honey?

435
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,730
I'm in back, darling.

436
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,437
Where you been?
We're real late for the dance.

437
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,974
Old man Wilson ought to put that
Studebaker of his out to pasture.

438
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:48,015
Not a week goes by without something
going wrong with that fool thing.

439
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,677
And the trouble is, he thinks he can
fix it all by himself.

440
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,016
So he goes in there
and messes everything up...

441
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,819
...and makes it worse than it
was in the first place.

442
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:01,623
I think he does it on purpose,
just so I'll come out and talk to him.

443
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,968
You know that carburetor I
fixed for him last week? He...

444
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,242
Where's Rosalie?

445
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,720
She's over at your mama's.
She's gonna sleep there tonight.

446
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,166
You ought not to eat that.
You'll get fat.

447
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,356
What about you?

448
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,867
- A lot you'd notice.
- I'd notice.

449
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,243
Wayne, we gotta go.
Everybody's waiting.

450
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,002
Wayne, you got to...

451
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,004
Hi!

452
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,116
Howdy.

453
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,290
Let's go inside and dance.

454
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,363
Come on, let's go dance.

455
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,795
I'll get it. I'll get it.

456
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,398
Thank you, baby.

457
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,746
- You warm enough?
- I'm fine.

458
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,245
You sure?

459
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,813
- Want my coat?
- No.

460
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,921
That's a nice table.

461
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,820
Hey, Wayne!

462
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,520
Howdy, Hank.

463
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,563
I sure am glad Rosalie took
that little trip tonight.

464
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,595
Why are you saying that?

465
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,199
Where were you two?
We were getting worried.

466
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,336
- Where you been?
- Hi, you guys!

467
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,732
- Hi, Buddy.
- Come here. I'll buy us a drink.

468
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,306
We're getting a bottle
of good-for-what-ails-you.

469
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,669
Be right back.

470
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,777
Just be a minute.

471
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,774
- How you been?
- I been just fine.

472
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,645
Hey, I hear you...

473
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,589
Where were you two?

474
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,411
Put that down. Come on.

475
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,601
Frank, are you craz...?

476
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,731
That man catches us in here,
he's gonna skin us alive.

477
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:10,277
I got something important to show you.
Do you want to see it or not?

478
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,829
Recordings for the Blind presents:

479
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:38,333
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.

480
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,033
Chapter one, "Bad News."

481
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,044
Between what matters
and what seems to matter...

482
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,878
...how should the world we know
judge wisely?

483
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:53,147
When the scheming, indomitable brain
of Sigfried Manderson was scattered...

484
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,257
Frank!

485
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,118
Possum!

486
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,130
Coming, Mama!

487
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,636
Ten minutes later, he's
driving a new Buick.

488
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,472
- You through?
- Yeah.

489
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,238
Vi and me are gonna dance.

490
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,007
I don't want to dance, Wayne.

491
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,186
Don't say no. You have
to dance. Come on.

492
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,283
Haven't danced all night.
Excuse me.

493
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,484
You look pretty tonight.

494
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,936
Let's go up to Dallas this weekend,
all right?

495
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,004
Take in a picture show...

496
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,836
...then have supper out
just like an old married couple?

497
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:50,445
You can tell Buddy you're visiting
that aunt of yours up in Dallas...

498
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,741
- No.
- Why not? Nobody will know.

499
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:58,320
- Wayne, I can't go on like this.
- Honey, just be patient.

500
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,481
I'll work everything out, don't worry.
Just give me a little bit of time.

501
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,184
I'll think of something, all right?

502
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:10,491
What's the matter, Vi?
We'll be fine. Just trust me.

503
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,192
Wayne, we're not gonna see
each other anymore.

504
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,700
- What?
- Not like we have been.

505
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,430
- Why?
- This is goodbye.

506
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,735
Mrs. Spalding?

507
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,403
Mrs. Spalding?

508
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,740
Mrs. Spalding?

509
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,325
Yes, Mr. Will. I'm right here.

510
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,225
Mrs. Spalding, believe me...

511
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,594
...if I had anyplace else to go
tonight besides...

512
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:55,101
...the State Home for the Infirm,
I'd gladly leave right now.

513
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,673
When I came here, all I asked
was to be left alone.

514
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,004
I am not some kind of freak
that is here on display...

515
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,477
...for the amusement of those
hooligans you call children.

516
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,740
- I will not...
- What?

517
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,316
...have them vandalizing
my personal property.

518
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,579
Don't come in my house
and talk about my children like that!

519
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,520
They are not hooligans or vandals!
They're well brought up children!

520
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,957
- You can't walk into my house...
- Fine!

521
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,264
Fine.

522
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,873
Whatever they are, you just
keep them out of my room.

523
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,912
That's all right, I'll get it.

524
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,221
The door's on your right.

525
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,155
Thank you.

526
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,499
Good night, Mrs. Spalding.

527
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,169
Good night, Mr. Will.

528
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,716
Ready, ma'am?

529
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,745
Get along, mules! Get along!

530
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,856
Now get along, mules!

531
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:03,258
Hah! Hah! Get along there! Hah!

532
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,237
Keep them straight, ma'am.

533
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,108
That's fine. That's just fine.

534
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,611
Right, Spalding. You don't know
the first thing about smoking.

535
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,155
I do so. I been smoking
since I was little.

536
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,920
- Then how come you can't inhale?
- I can so. I can inhale real good.

537
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,926
Mr. Will! Mr. Will!

538
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,157
Frank got caught smoking in school
and the teacher told Ma...

539
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,268
...and Frank's gonna catch it!

540
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,599
Frank, I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

541
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:36,790
Well, young man? What would
your pa do if he were here?

542
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,529
He'd spank me, I reckon.

543
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,622
I guess that's what we
got to do, then.

544
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,187
Frank, what's she gonna do
to you? Frank!

545
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,823
- Ma, what are you gonna do to him?
- It's okay.

546
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:12,256
Ma, what you gonna do to Frank?
Are you gonna spank him?

547
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,827
Can I watch? Can I?

548
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,224
Possum!

549
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,901
Frank, when your pa did this,
how'd he do it?

550
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,237
Most times...

551
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:33,310
...I'd lean over the table, grab hold,
and he'd let me have it.

552
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,274
How many times?

553
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:40,152
Pa would be mad
over something like this.

554
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:44,216
I reckon he'd give me 10 good licks.

555
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,336
I'm ready.

556
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,142
Ma?

557
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,154
I'm ready.

558
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,536
What's wrong?

559
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,737
Frank's getting a licking.

560
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,822
Did it hurt?

561
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:56,991
Come on.

562
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,302
Let's let old Frank
be by himself for a bit.

563
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,737
Tell you what, why don't you help me
with my chores?

564
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,476
Mrs. Spalding?

565
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,813
I won't do that again. Ever.

566
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,425
Are you all right?

567
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,291
God, I miss my husband.

568
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,985
Lord, I can't hardly see
my hand in front of my face.

569
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,953
Feels like rain.

570
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,922
- Must be coming up a real storm.
- Sure is.

571
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,798
Help me wash dishes.

572
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,910
Now don't be mad, baby.
You're a good baby.

573
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,410
I made each of you
some cookies too.

574
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,493
Come on, boy. Let's git.

575
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,287
Come on, git! Git!

576
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:41,160
Git on, git on! Come on! Come on!

577
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,905
We got to get inside, ma'am.
Storm's coming from over there!

578
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,097
Git on! Git on, boy!

579
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,183
Come on! Let him be!

580
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:05,821
Come on, boy!

581
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,463
Come on, won't you?

582
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,828
Let him go! Come on! Run!

583
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,072
Girls, get in the schoolroom.

584
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,768
Boys! Robert, let's go!

585
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,778
Come on! Come on! No dawdling!

586
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,614
Sally!

587
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,351
Come on! Come along! Be careful
getting up these stairs.

588
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,047
Everybody get inside!

589
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,624
- Where's Frank?
- I don't know.

590
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,463
Let's go!

591
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,397
Toby!

592
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,963
All right.

593
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,539
Get the windows open
before the house blows!

594
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,013
You get the dining room,
then get on the floor!

595
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,379
I'll get these in here! Hurry up!

596
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,890
You're a little baby.

597
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,058
Possum!

598
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,384
Here! Give me him!

599
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,372
Possum!

600
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,735
- Possum, it's okay.
- Mr. Will! Mr. Will!

601
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,098
It's okay.

602
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,779
Step down! Step down!

603
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:48,824
Step down! Step down! Step down!

604
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:59,025
Frank Spalding!
There's a tornado coming!

605
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,532
Get on in here!
You'll get yourself killed.

606
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,708
I can't! I gotta get home!

607
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,317
Here!

608
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,327
I got him, ma'am!

609
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,661
Come on, Mr. Will.

610
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:38,968
It's all right. It's all right.
Get in now.

611
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:45,609
Mr. Will! Step down!
Step down!

612
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:49,941
Watch your head!

613
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:55,215
Ma!

614
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,430
- Ma!
- Oh, my God, it's Frank!

615
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,433
Frank, stay there!

616
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,388
Frank, come on!

617
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,648
Now, come on, we got to get inside.

618
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,291
Come on, hurry up!

619
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,768
Get him in! Get him in!

620
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,675
Okay! Come on! Get in there!

621
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,884
Hurry up! Get inside!

622
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,400
Get off...!

623
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,674
It's okay now.

624
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,311
It's all over now. Come on out.

625
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,375
It's all right. It's all...

626
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,387
Vi?

627
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,827
Hey, baby, it's okay.

628
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,866
It's okay now.
Everything's gonna be all right.

629
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,996
Oh, darling, I was so scared.

630
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,741
I was so scared something would...

631
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,609
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to you.

632
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,045
Come on, ma'am.

633
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,984
Here, give me your hand, Mr. Will.

634
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,888
How bad is it?

635
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:29,326
Everything's a little bent,
but it's still here.

636
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:00,988
Come on.

637
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,266
- Come on, Vi.
- Oh, Bud, let's leave this town.

638
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,733
There'll always be tornadoes.
Everybody'll always be poor.

639
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,701
Nothing can work out here.

640
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:14,307
I want to move, Buddy. Please.
I want...

641
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,738
Sure.

642
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,211
Hold me.

643
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,508
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.

644
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,851
- Morning, Mr. Will.
- Good morning.

645
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,858
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.

646
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,955
- In Chicago yesterday.

647
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,532
Cotton held steady after dropping
to a record low...

648
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,761
...of 3.5 cents a pound
over the last four days.

649
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,270
Poultry and eggs were down
to a seasonal low.

650
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,136
Corn remains unchanged.
Soybeans gained...

651
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:25,378
So let me see.
At 3.5 cents a pound...

652
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,708
...30 acres, that would be...

653
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,078
That comes to $175.

654
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:37,492
Think there's any chance
cotton prices'll go back up?

655
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,296
How much money you got
left in your account?

656
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,902
Twenty-four dollars. That's all.

657
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:52,808
- It's not enough for your payment.
- I know.

658
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,545
I was wondering...

659
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:02,477
What I made from my cotton
would cover most of the payment.

660
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:04,910
Could you all...

661
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,413
...maybe, wait for the rest?

662
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:11,191
That's something only the
president of the bank can decide.

663
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,287
- You shouldn't get your hopes up.
- Could you ask?

664
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:13,143
There ain't no chance
you'll ever get that prize money.

665
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,418
- It won't work.
- It's a hundred dollars.

666
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,957
And that plus a crop
would be enough to make the payment.

667
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,925
You cannot begin to get that cotton
picked on time.

668
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:23,996
Why? Moses has said
that it's ready.

669
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,633
Moses always says things.

670
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,895
- It's not always true.
- I said cotton comes in early here.

671
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,333
But in a couple days...

672
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,905
...the pickers will
get up to this county.

673
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,703
They pick it fast
as you can say Jack Robinson!

674
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,744
- Then we'll start right now!
- You got 30 acres to pick.

675
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,142
The kids can help.

676
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:41,748
That won't be nearly enough.

677
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,920
- I'll pick 24 hours a day.
- Did you ever pick cotton?

678
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,282
After an hour, the hulls
start cutting your fingers.

679
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,151
By noon your hands is bleeding.

680
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,189
Later your fingers
start to swell.

681
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,918
Later there ain't no feeling
in your hands.

682
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,759
I ain't even speaking about what
it does to your knees and your back.

683
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,528
Get that through your head.
Once and for all, we can't do it.

684
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,001
Stop thinking about it
before you kill yourself!

685
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,197
Now you listen to me.

686
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,241
If we lose this place, you're going
back to begging for meals.

687
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,174
They'll put you in a state home.

688
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,280
I'll lose what's left
of my family.

689
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,710
I won't let that happen.

690
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,351
I don't care what it takes.
I don't care if it kills me.

691
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,817
I don't care if it kills you.
I won't give up.

692
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:23,558
And if the two of you do,
you can go straight to hell!

693
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,850
Careful with that now, hon.

694
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,064
I bet she isn't ready.

695
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:36,204
All the time we been coming here,
she's never been ready.

696
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,637
I'm here. I'm coming.

697
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,604
I start out an hour early,
I always end up a half-hour late.

698
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,278
Okay, what can I do to help?

699
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,812
Get the cards
on top of the chest of drawers.

700
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,211
- That looks good.
- Want me to do something?

701
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:51,477
Set up the table, would you, Buddy?

702
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,937
Let me help you with that,
Margaret.

703
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,386
Can you find them?
Here, let me get the light.

704
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,495
Right here.

705
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,293
Come on.

706
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,787
You want my peanuts, honey?

707
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:14,169
I'll take your six, honey.
Discard and rummy.

708
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,369
I don't believe you.

709
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,138
Thirty-two here.

710
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,767
Thirty-two. What's the damage,
Margaret?

711
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:23,839
Seventy-three.

712
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,570
Seventy-three?

713
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,245
Listen, you two. Vi and me
got a little announcement.

714
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,851
Next time you want
to play cards with us...

715
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,924
...you'll have to go to Houston.

716
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,790
I got an offer from an oil company
down there...

717
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,561
...too good to pass up.

718
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,925
You've lived here all your lives.

719
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,567
Well, don't look at me.
It was Vi's idea.

720
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:54,442
You know how hard it is to change
her mind once she gets it set.

721
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,802
We'll miss you, Margaret.

722
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,480
It's just such a wonderful
opportunity for Bud.

723
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,418
We just can't pass it up.

724
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:11,782
We'll miss you a lot more
than you'll miss us.

725
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,896
Congratulations.

726
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,597
Congratulations, Buddy.

727
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,167
We're real happy for you.

728
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:25,636
Thanks. I'll get another drink.
You want one?

729
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,289
It's my deal.

730
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:17,089
Whatever happened between you and Vi,
I don't want to know about it.

731
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,086
I don't ever want to hear about it.

732
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,994
Am I right?

733
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,591
Am I right?

734
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:30,802
Yes.

735
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:38,173
I'm not the same dumb beauty operator
you married eight years ago.

736
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,221
What are you gonna do?

737
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,362
I don't know.

738
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,126
I got the shop.

739
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,900
Rosalie and me can get along
without you.

740
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,939
I'm never going to see Viola again.

741
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:12,074
- It's over between us.
- It's too late for that.

742
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,781
I don't think I can
live with you anymore.

743
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,654
I don't think I love you anymore.

744
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,425
Please don't say that.

745
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,307
Lord, this ain't gonna work.

746
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:29,484
Ain't no way we gonna get
all this cotton picked...

747
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,812
...and yet you sent us
out here anyway.

748
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,387
I swear, sometimes I don't know
what's gotten into you.

749
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,045
Mr. Will, you gotta talk
to that woman.

750
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,514
She won't pay me no mind,
but she listens to you.

751
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,381
It won't do any good.

752
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,948
We only picked 2 acres today.
Should've done at least 4.

753
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:13,620
And that's when we're fresh.
What's it gonna be in a week?

754
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,957
How many pickers would it take
to get the cotton in on time?

755
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,267
Nine or 10, at least.

756
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,396
Okay. We better hire them.

757
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,800
- Hire pickers?
- With what, Mrs. Spalding?

758
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,410
You said yourself you only had
$24 in the bank.

759
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,876
That ain't near enough
to hire 10 pickers.

760
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,742
I'll pay them out of the first bale.

761
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,577
And what happens if you don't get
the first bale in?

762
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,185
Then I'll pay them out
of the money I get from the gin.

763
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,822
If you do that,
you'll have hardly any money left.

764
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,382
I'll take that chance.

765
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:14,251
We ain't got much time before
them pickers in the South...

766
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:20,292
All right, ma'am.
You got what you asked for.

767
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,658
Have they had breakfast yet?

768
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,498
I doubt it.

769
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,218
Governor Johnson appealed to
President Roosevelt today...

770
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:51,586
...for emergency relief due to
the failure of the WPA program...

771
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:53,658
...to get started in Dallas.

772
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,989
The governor had asked
the administration...

773
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:59,099
...for $1,000,000
in direct relief yesterday.

774
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:02,566
Texas was allotted $500,000 instead.

775
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,207
Governor Johnson said the situation
was becoming critical.

776
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,236
Meanwhile, in Baton Rouge...

777
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:12,436
...Huey Long's last legislative
measures, 37 of them...

778
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:16,378
...took a fall last Tuesday, as the
administration he left behind him...

779
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,884
...pushed its investigation
of his assassination 10 days ago...

780
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,522
...by Dr. Carl A. Weiss, Jr.

781
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,853
The Chicago Cubs retained their lead
in the National League pennant race...

782
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:31,430
...by defeating the New York Giants
8-3...

783
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,101
...before a crowd of 29, 740...

784
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,293
...at Wrigley Field in Chicago.

785
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,905
It was the Cubs' 13th
straight victory.

786
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:42,736
Second place St. Louis Cardinals
beat Brooklyn 1-0...

787
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:46,277
The Giants are now 4 1/2
games behind the Cubs.

788
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:53,619
The weather in central Texas today
will be clear, no sign of rain.

789
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,874
Over here, Mr. Will!

790
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:29,481
- Moze, the pickers are here.
- How you know that?

791
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,026
I heard 11 trucks
pass by the house...

792
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,320
...and from the direction
they were headed...

793
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,394
...they were going out
to the Rapp place.

794
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,429
- How much land the Rapps have?
- Four hundred acres.

795
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,699
That means we got three days left.

796
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:45,134
We ain't got no time to waste!
Let's get to work!

797
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,244
Git along there!

798
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,179
Git along now.

799
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:05,147
You ain't no more tired than I am.
Git along!

800
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,452
Morning, ma'am.

801
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:59,071
Mrs. Spalding, I hate to be
the one to tell you this...

802
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:03,335
...but that sister of yours doesn't
have a natural talent for cooking.

803
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:15,318
I got to thinking, if we all weren't
gonna die of ptomaine poisoning...

804
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,889
...I'd have to do something about it.

805
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,765
So I'm fixing us some green beans
like my mother used to make.

806
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:32,873
Mrs. Spalding?

807
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,439
Mrs. Spalding, are you okay?

808
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,943
I was remembering a dream.

809
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:55,826
What day is this?

810
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,890
It's Friday, ma'am.

811
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,529
When do we have to be at the gin?

812
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,339
Tomorrow morning.

813
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,776
Recordings for The Blind presents:

814
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:19,378
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.

815
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:22,482
Chapter one, "Bad News."

816
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:26,015
"Between what matters
and what seems to matter...

817
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:28,781
...how should the world
we know judge...?

818
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,328
You all right?

819
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:30,611
The end.

820
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,198
Ma'am?

821
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:54,338
Miz Spalding.

822
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,407
Hey, Miz Spalding!

823
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,248
We're finished.

824
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:04,083
We done it.

825
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,023
He'll be here any minute.
Get this straight.

826
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,488
He'll try to charge you
for ginning the cotton.

827
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,354
I'll tell him no, do it for the seed.

828
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,461
He'll say he'll take all the seed.

829
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:17,392
I say he can only have half.

830
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:20,432
No, we offer a third
and settle for half.

831
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,536
We gotta get 31/2 cent a pound,
even with the prize money.

832
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,569
You gotta remember that...

833
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,974
Here he comes.

834
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,459
- Howdy, Mrs. Spalding.
- Howdy, Mr. Simmons.

835
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:53,225
Nice load of cotton.
You ought to be real proud.

836
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:57,063
Let's go into my office
and see if we can do some business.

837
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,547
Well, look who's here.

838
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:13,619
Go on and have a seat.

839
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:18,081
I ought to explain to you
how things work around here.

840
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:23,230
I gin the cotton for a fee, then I buy
your cotton if we agree on a price.

841
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:26,423
For ginning, it's customary
to charge $5 on the ton.

842
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,067
Excuse me.

843
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:31,969
I was told that you sometimes
gin the cotton for the seed.

844
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:36,837
Yes, that's another way of working it.
I gin the cotton and keep the seed.

845
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,912
The way it was explained to me,
you're supposed to keep...

846
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:43,912
...a third.

847
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:49,885
I'll tell you right now,
I won't pay that. Excuse me.

848
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,919
A little too much sun.

849
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:57,257
Out of respect for your late husband,
I am prepared to go 50/50.

850
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,096
Fine.

851
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,736
I expect you realize the bottom
dropped out of the cotton market.

852
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:06,202
I'm pretty much doing you a favor,
taking it off your hands.

853
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:11,304
Mr. Simmons, I want 41/2 cents
a pound for my cotton.

854
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,878
You don't want me,
you want Santa Claus.

855
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:17,074
I'll pay you 2.75
and not a red cent more.

856
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:18,783
Four?

857
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:21,911
Maybe you haven't heard about
the Depression.

858
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,591
I can't pay that
or anything close to that.

859
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:26,919
Three cents a pound,
take it or leave it.

860
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:35,664
You know what your trouble is? You're
the victim of unbridled greed. 3.5.

861
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,970
Ma'am, that is the honest price.

862
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:42,802
That's it.

863
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,278
I did my best. I tried to help.

864
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,415
You can't blame me.
I can't do no more for you.

865
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:52,552
Go on down to the square and see
how much you get for your cotton.

866
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:11,130
Mr. Simmons?

867
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:18,135
It just occurred to me. I was looking
at the pictures here on your wall.

868
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,008
I remember how much store
your daddy set...

869
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:23,843
...on ginning the first bale
of cotton each year.

870
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:29,449
This'll be the first year
since I don't remember when...

871
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:31,249
...that y'all aren't first.

872
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:36,793
I guess Mr. Wheeler at Wheeler's Gin
will be pleased to meet my price...

873
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,933
...just so he can show off
all next year at the Masons.

874
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:41,260
Mrs. Spalding...

875
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,460
...come back and sit down.

876
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:53,312
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

877
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:57,242
Let's get this wagon
to the loading bay.

878
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:58,441
Well?

879
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:02,213
What happened? How much did you get?

880
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:05,221
3.75 cents per pound.

881
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,723
That's more than market price.

882
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:12,332
If we'd planted the other 10 acres in
cotton, think what we would've made.

883
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:14,330
We would've been dead.

884
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:18,904
- Mr. Estes is selling 12 acres.
- Have you taken leave of your senses?

885
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:22,166
- We'd have almost 60 acres of land.
- You can't afford that!

886
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:24,241
We only need one crop of cotton.

887
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:28,211
Just one good crop, and we could
afford to buy us a tractor.

888
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:29,513
A tractor.

889
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,544
I always wanted to have a tractor.

890
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:36,985
I always thought if I had a tractor,
ain't no telling what I could do!

891
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,604
Mrs. Spalding?

892
01:31:56,477 --> 01:31:59,105
Could I trouble you for a cup of tea?

893
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:02,479
Of course. I'll put
the water on for you.

894
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,851
Do you mind if I wait in here?

895
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:09,352
Not at all.

896
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,976
Trying to fix Frank's shoe.
It's got a big hole in it.

897
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:36,883
Mrs. Spalding, can I ask you
a question?

898
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:44,119
What do you look like?

899
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:01,236
I have long hair
and I tie it up in the back.

900
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:04,077
And I have brown eyes.

901
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:09,841
I always wanted to have blue eyes,
like my mama, but...

902
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,777
...Margaret got those.

903
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:20,320
And my teeth stick out
in front a little...

904
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:28,394
...because I sucked my thumb
a long time when I was a little girl.

905
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:40,443
I'm no real beauty.

906
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:44,714
I'm all right.

907
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,648
Thank you.

908
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:53,723
Your tea's ready.

909
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:08,474
All right, friends...

910
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:12,339
...one of our all-time favorites:
"A Golden Dream."

911
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,353
Mama?

912
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:32,690
May I please have this dance?

913
01:34:36,704 --> 01:34:38,296
Frank Spalding...

914
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:41,104
...I'd be most pleased.

915
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:54,747
One...

916
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:20,705
Twenty-five dollars.

917
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:23,950
Miz Spalding give me $25.

918
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:26,751
She ought not to have done that.

919
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:31,050
She can't afford to go around...
What's the matter?

920
01:35:36,197 --> 01:35:37,789
I thought I heard something.

921
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:40,857
Course you did. You heard me talking.

922
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:44,765
You ought to speak with her. If
she goes around spending money...

923
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:47,133
Moze, there's somebody out there.

924
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:52,470
I don't expect so, but I'll go see,
just to make you feel better.

925
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:01,620
Light's on in the barn.
Be right back.

926
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:46,296
Get him!

927
01:36:56,544 --> 01:36:57,806
Moze!

928
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:03,476
Hold him!

929
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:11,353
I'm gonna hit him again.
Get hold of him for me.

930
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:12,617
Give me him!

931
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:21,894
- Grab him! Come on!
- Goddamn nigger son of a bitch.

932
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:26,770
Get him!

933
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:28,870
Moze!

934
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:32,274
Keep out of this.
It's none of your business.

935
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,470
You move away from him right now.

936
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:37,611
Put that away, Mr. Will,
before you hurt somebody.

937
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:39,183
Goddamn!

938
01:37:41,455 --> 01:37:42,479
Now!

939
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:38,676
Hold it, Mr. Will. We don't have
any quarrel with you.

940
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:41,871
Mr. Thompson, why are you
doing this to him?

941
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:44,874
You got the wrong man.
That ain't Thompson.

942
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:49,346
That's Mr. Thompson. I've been
selling him brooms for years.

943
01:38:49,556 --> 01:38:51,353
As sure as you're Mr. Shaw.

944
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:54,857
And that's Mr. Simmons
over there by the barn.

945
01:38:55,896 --> 01:38:57,830
All right, boys, let's go home.

946
01:39:12,646 --> 01:39:14,045
All right, nigger.

947
01:39:15,015 --> 01:39:16,983
But I ain't through with you yet.

948
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:08,328
- Want a Coke?
- No.

949
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,973
Would you rather just go on home?

950
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,069
Want to dance with me?

951
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:20,945
I guess.

952
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:25,646
You sure?

953
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:32,985
- Howdy, Wayne. Margaret.
- Hi, Mr. Cheeves.

954
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:36,185
- Good evening.
- My, don't you two look nice together.

955
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:37,796
Thank you, ma'am.

956
01:40:44,838 --> 01:40:47,238
Been a long time
since we danced together.

957
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:53,707
That dress sure looks pretty.

958
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:55,479
It's new.

959
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:58,247
The color. I really like the color.

960
01:41:06,293 --> 01:41:08,989
What do I have to do
to tell you I'm sorry?

961
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:33,048
He's out in the shack.

962
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:43,426
Moze!

963
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:48,066
Yes, ma'am.

964
01:41:55,008 --> 01:41:57,533
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to be
moving along.

965
01:41:57,744 --> 01:42:02,306
Won't be long before that bunch comes
back, and I'd best be gone by then.

966
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:05,477
What am I gonna do without you?

967
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:13,617
I'd appreciate it if you say goodbye
to Frank and Possum for me.

968
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:16,896
I'd soon as not have them
see me like this.

969
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:23,402
I been making on this doll
for Possum.

970
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:26,664
If you could give it to her,
I'd be most grateful.

971
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:32,343
And old Frank, he had his eye on this
rabbit foot of mine for a spell...

972
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,513
...so I expect he might as well
have it.

973
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:39,641
Here.

974
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:43,013
This is for you.

975
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:47,189
It's a handkerchief
belonged to my mama.

976
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:49,721
I thought maybe you could use it.

977
01:42:56,937 --> 01:43:00,998
I reckon I got a bit more attached
to this place than I intended to.

978
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,840
Well, Miz Spalding...

979
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:13,877
I'm gonna miss you.

980
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:25,029
Yes, ma'am.

981
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,359
You took a no-account piece of land...

982
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:31,197
...and people that didn't know
what they were doing...

983
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:34,533
...and you farmed that land
better than anybody could...

984
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:35,799
...colored or white.

985
01:43:36,476 --> 01:43:39,673
You brought in the first
bale of cotton this year.

986
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:43,012
Don't you ever forget that.

987
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:45,708
Yes, ma'am.

988
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:49,884
Reckon I did that.

989
01:43:55,495 --> 01:43:57,224
I reckon I did.

990
01:44:57,624 --> 01:45:00,650
This morning we take our text
from First Corinthians...

991
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:04,854
...the 13th chapter,
verses one through eight.

992
01:45:05,999 --> 01:45:09,696
"Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels...

993
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:11,734
...and have not love...

994
01:45:11,938 --> 01:45:16,238
...I am become as a sounding brass
or a tinkling cymbal.

995
01:45:17,177 --> 01:45:19,372
Though I have the gift of prophecy...

996
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:24,312
...and all knowledge and have not
love, I am nothing.

997
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:29,788
And though I bestow all my goods to
feed the poor and have not love...

998
01:45:30,223 --> 01:45:32,555
...it profiteth me nothing.

999
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,497
Love is patient, kind.
Love is not jealous or boastful.

1000
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,268
Love never ends."

1001
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:06,354
On the night before his crucifixion...

1002
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:09,358
...our Lord gathered
with his disciples.

1003
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:12,963
He broke the bread
and blessed it...

1004
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:17,330
...saying, "Take, eat.
This is my body."

1005
01:46:18,004 --> 01:46:19,904
And he took the cup and said:

1006
01:46:20,107 --> 01:46:24,441
"Drink. This is my blood
which I shed for thee."

1007
01:46:31,418 --> 01:46:32,646
Peace of God.

1008
01:46:58,311 --> 01:46:59,710
Peace of God.

1009
01:47:35,248 --> 01:47:36,476
Peace of God.

1010
01:47:38,018 --> 01:47:39,417
Peace of God.

1011
01:47:55,902 --> 01:47:57,369
Peace of God.

1012
01:51:14,902 --> 01:51:15,369
{{{ the end }}}
