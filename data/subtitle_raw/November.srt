1
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:33,086
Come, come.

3
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:09,686
Alright. You want work?

4
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:13,360
Go make a ladder out of bread.

5
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,284
What's wrong with him?
 - I don't know.

6
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,483
Might be because of the rain.

7
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:29,481
Goddamnit! I used my best tools on him.

8
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:22,046
It's so beautiful. 
Like the Christmas tree in church.

9
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:26,405
I like slaughtering pigs more.

10
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:37,718
Based on Andrus Kivirähk's novel "Rehepapp".

11
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,436
Get up! It's All Souls' Day.

12
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,121
Go heat the sauna.

13
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,518
And you set the table.

14
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:17,122
Let them eat and bathe, the poor beasts.

15
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,483
They're not beasts!

16
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:26,482
They're mother and grandfather. 
How can you say that?

17
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:32,396
No need to mince words about it.
 The dead can't afford to be picky.

18
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:38,755
They're no longer people.
 So why not call them beasts?

19
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:53,921
When my grandmother was little,

20
00:07:54,087 --> 00:08:00,037
she snuck into the sauna to see 
what the dead were doing in there.

21
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:04,404
She opened the door, and what did she see?

22
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,719
Human-sized chickens 
thrashing themselves with birch twigs.

23
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,997
Isn't a chicken an animal?

24
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,802
Are you trying to heat the village?

25
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:41,759
What did you bring for me?

26
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:46,205
Hold on. You'll see.

27
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,717
How pretty!

28
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,520
My God! It's so fancy!

29
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:10,521
Not bad, eh?
 - Where did you get it?

30
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:15,880
>From the old baroness. It's her last one.

31
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,965
I went through all her trunks

32
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:27,200
but she has nothing left to take. 
It's all mine.

33
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:31,719
I feel bad for the old lady.

34
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:36,880
She's bedridden and doesn't
 even have a night gown to wear.

35
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:42,396
Once I felt so bad for her
 that I gave her one of mine.

36
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:47,357
Yours? Aren't your nightgowns really hers?

37
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,123
What's in the past doesn't matter.

38
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,961
What do you want for it?

39
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:04,356
It's a very expensive and nice dress.

40
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:22,597
What happened to your silver brooch?
 I'd give up the dress for that.

41
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:30,242
For this, all you get is a strip of silk.

42
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,401
She's all tarted up. It's disgusting.

43
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,637
I don't know. She looks beautiful.

44
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,879
You try cooking that beauty in a pot

45
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,356
and see if it fills your belly.

46
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:11,643
I saw... 
your mother by that willow tree.

47
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:24,760
How did you know I was
 looking for my mother?

48
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:27,487
I'm also waiting.

49
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,517
My mother is buried here too.

50
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:48,122
The Rääk dead are here.

51
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:52,405
Welcome! Let's go home.

52
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:02,038
Come on.

53
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:15,486
Are you coming? Let's go!

54
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:27,403
Wasn't that Liina?

55
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:30,401
Yes.

56
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:35,322
She's grown into a beautiful woman. 
-Yeah.

57
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:50,402
The sauna is ready.

58
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,525
As always, you'll take the bed

59
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:00,837
and we'll sleep on the floor.

60
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:07,799
I'm not worried about my hidden treasure.

61
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:15,076
But I brought some trinkets home.

62
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:21,404
Where are they?
- Liina?

63
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:52,238
Where is it? 
Where's the ring?

64
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:03,722
It's gone!

65
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:15,838
So that's why the kratt 
was snooping around!

66
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:20,285
Why didn't you tell me? When was it?

67
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,158
The day before yesterday!

68
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:26,364
I came from the well with buckets

69
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,882
and I saw a kratt 
scurry out of the back.

70
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,799
What did it look like?

71
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,084
It had a broom for a tail 
and a bucket for a head.

72
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:41,323
I'm going to find that thief
 and tear him to pieces.

73
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,525
Where are you taking that bread?

74
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:57,522
If she's that hungry,
 she can come in with the others.

75
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,527
Father hasn't changed.

76
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,995
How could you bear him?

77
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,558
But I didn't.

78
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:30,444
Eat, mother.

79
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,596
I had you.

80
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:27,045
Everyone needs something... 
Even better, someone.

81
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:41,002
I have someone. 
-Very good.

82
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,563
Mother!

83
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,035
God speed, dear ghosts!

84
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:05,243
How's life in the other world? 
Get enough to eat?

85
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:08,399
Can't complain.

86
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:13,083
Of course not, if you have bread to eat.

87
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,845
All we have is willow bark and slush.

88
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:25,284
We heard the Rääk silver 
is buried somewhere.

89
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,483
I wonder where?

90
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:37,085
We want to go for a walk 
to pick some flowers.

91
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:41,035
It's so nice out!
 We want to make a wreath!

92
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:44,961
What flowers will you pick 
in November, you old hag?

93
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:23,075
The body and blood of Christ.

94
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:28,044
The body and blood of Christ.

95
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:58,360
<i>Talupojad hakkavad Jumalasõna kuulama.</i>
 The peasants are listening to the Word of God.

96
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:11,202
<i>Mida nad teevad?</i>
 What are they doing?

97
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:18,083
<i>Mida nad teevad?</i>
 What are they doing?

98
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:25,125
What are they doing?
 -They use the wafers as bullets

99
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,279
so they'll never miss 
when they're hunting.

100
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:31,966
<i>Mida?</i> 
What? - It's the body of Christ.

101
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:38,396
No beast can resist Jesus. 
Jesus will bring it down.

102
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,077
<i>See on ju patt!</i> 
That is a sin!

103
00:27:53,887 --> 00:27:55,525
Give me work Sander.

104
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:59,684
A kratt needs to work.

105
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:03,965
My master didn't give me work.

106
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:09,281
So I wrung his neck.

107
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:14,676
And who was that fool?
- Some shepherd boy.

108
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,645
A child, of course.

109
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,719
A kratt could never get 
the better of a grown man.

110
00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:31,720
Stop staring.

111
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:34,526
You'll never wring my neck.

112
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:39,238
I didn't make you
 so my name's not in the Devil's book.

113
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:43,480
Why do you think
 I pulled you out of the mud?

114
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,840
I came to ask for currants.

115
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:53,521
Going to the crossroads again?

116
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:56,838
Well, my last kratt caught fire.

117
00:28:57,807 --> 00:29:02,358
And I'm too lousy of a man 
to manage without a kratt.

118
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,846
What do you want?
 -To buy a soul for a kratt.

119
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:26,400
A soul? 
Are you eating your kratts?

120
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:32,324
Eat fish instead, 
they taste much better.

121
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:35,684
My family eats tree bark and bats.

122
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:39,442
We won't survive the winter 
without a kratt.

123
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,801
Write your name here in blood

124
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:52,516
and you can even make your pants dance!

125
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:57,044
Shall we make those pants dance?

126
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:01,204
Leave my pants be.

127
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:06,919
I have a kratt's body ready at home. 
Just give it a soul.

128
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:10,045
We can make 
my pants dance next time.

129
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:29,479
Blood for you, a kratt soul for me.

130
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:33,686
Go now. It already lives.

131
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:43,279
That hit the spot! 
Pour me another.

132
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:46,803
So, how are things 
in your neck of the woods?

133
00:34:56,367 --> 00:35:02,237
It's a constant shit storm. 
Fucking hard work.

134
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:04,477
No time to take a dump!

135
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:38,886
We can have the wedding at Christmas.

136
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:49,681
The pig, the old cunt, 
isn't putting on weight this year.

137
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:56,036
She should be ready by then.

138
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:02,079
Then we slit her throat and good to go.

139
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:09,996
And how will you marry her 
with a slit throat?

140
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:19,600
Who? 
-The pig. Your bride.

141
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:30,236
What is this bullshit?
 The pig isn't my bride.

142
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:37,357
So who is? 
- Well, you are.

143
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:40,323
Me?

144
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:48,246
Are you sure?
 -Very sure.

145
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:51,444
And I thought it was the pig.

146
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:01,560
What is this bullshit?

147
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:08,485
Pig and pig...

148
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:18,077
I'm leaving.

149
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:33,277
Everything set?
 - Piss off!

150
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:33,364
The baron's daughter
 came to visit from Germany

151
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:35,836
and brought a suitcase full of under pants.

152
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,366
How many do you want?

153
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:44,956
How can you take them? 
Won't the baron find out?

154
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:48,483
It's not his business
 what I do with my underpants!

155
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:51,798
How are they your underpants?

156
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:55,721
Who else's? 
This land belongs to Estonians.

157
00:39:56,807 --> 00:40:01,278
Everything on Estonian soil 
belongs to us.

158
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:08,361
Don't you know about King Lembitu 
and our ancient freedoms?

159
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:11,405
How the baron's forefathers 
unjustly killed our king

160
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,398
and began ruling over us?

161
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,525
That doesn't give them 
the right to our land!

162
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:21,440
I am an Estonian.

163
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,485
Thus, the baron's underpants belong to me.

164
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:31,202
Is that what you'll tell the baron?

165
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:39,081
I'll tell the baron 
that his underpants got horny

166
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:42,444
and ran off into the woods!

167
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:57,562
How many do you want?
- Wait, Ints. Slow down.

168
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:00,560
I have another problem.

169
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:04,886
Can you sneak me 
into the baroness's room?

170
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:11,998
A strange desire.
- Why?

171
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:20,046
Isn't her room on our land?

172
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:23,561
Don't I, as a descendant of Lembitu,

173
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:25,843
have the right to go 
in there if I want?

174
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:31,843
That's right!

175
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:38,762
And no German thug 
can take that right away!

176
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:45,719
Come to the kitchen door tonight.

177
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:02,761
Luise!

178
00:43:53,327 --> 00:43:55,238
Hello.

179
00:47:23,327 --> 00:47:26,125
<i>
Isa, keegi oli siin!</i>
 Father, someone was here!

180
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:29,836
<i>
Rahune. Siin pole kedagi.</i> 
Calm down. There's no one here.

181
00:47:31,087 --> 00:47:35,956
<i>
See on su haigusest. Täna on täiskuu.</i> 
It's your illness. There's a full moon.

182
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:02,803
I love you. I love you.

183
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:05,686
I love you.

184
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:19,123
Move that stump.

185
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:42,405
Move that by tonight.

186
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:47,963
Let me help you.

187
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:53,558
Keep it up.

188
00:49:57,967 --> 00:50:02,404
Well, men, taking a rest?

189
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:08,395
Let's get to work! Take these...

190
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:12,845
Arsehole! You can't tell us what to do!

191
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:16,761
Manor lackey! Arse-kisser!

192
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:18,963
Hans!

193
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:26,117
You weasel! Damned prick!
- Hans!

194
00:50:32,727 --> 00:50:34,683
Stop it!

195
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,966
Don't do that!

196
00:50:41,047 --> 00:50:44,642
Hans!
 -Your Hans became the overseer!

197
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:47,879
Liar! 
-That maggot!

198
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:58,640
I want to be his wife.

199
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:28,957
Witch, can you make him forget her

200
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,244
and love me instead?

201
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:55,158
One thing we can do

202
00:51:55,327 --> 00:51:59,400
is kill the girl Hans loves.

203
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,278
I'll do it.

204
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:26,042
Throw this at her window.

205
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:29,961
When she looks out,

206
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:35,599
the arrow will hit her head and
 spill out her brains.

207
00:54:48,087 --> 00:54:51,557
Uncle! Take me across the river.

208
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:55,436
I'll repay you with a kiss.

209
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:14,357
Where's my kiss?

210
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:03,918
Take your pants off 
and put them on your head.

211
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:06,726
The plague will think we have two arses

212
00:56:06,887 --> 00:56:09,037
and won't dare to touch us.

213
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:24,561
Drop dead, cretin!

214
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,204
That was close.

215
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:15,196
Get up! No time to waste.

216
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:18,006
The plague will be back

217
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:22,763
and we won't fool it twice.

218
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,479
It has transformed into something else

219
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:30,516
and we have to find it. Go look!

220
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:34,043
What the hell are we looking for? Tell us what it turned into.

221
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:39,520
I don't know. Use your heads.

222
00:59:39,687 --> 00:59:42,485
If you find something unusual, 
bring it to me.

223
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,200
That's a nail.

224
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,558
A mosquito.

225
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:16,959
A button. Haven't you seen a button before?

226
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:30,206
A snail. - What about the manor?
 Will the plague go there?

227
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:35,561
I hope it goes and 
strikes down every one of them.

228
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:39,041
This is no time 
to squabble with each other.

229
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:42,085
Tomorrow we'll all lie 
side by side in one grave.

230
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:51,925
There's nothing here!

231
01:01:00,247 --> 01:01:06,163
No, Liina, dear. This time,
the plague was cleverer than us.

232
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:37,082
Well, hello!

233
01:01:39,127 --> 01:01:43,359
This one couldn't bear to 
show the coin to others.

234
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:48,116
But the plague isn't a sausage 
you eat alone.

235
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,083
Come on, then!

236
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:03,958
Why spare the likes of us?

237
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:06,918
We steal from each other

238
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:13,322
but bury our haul or gobble it down.

239
01:02:13,487 --> 01:02:17,799
We should be happy 
to be freed from our shame.

240
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:24,444
I only ask one thing of you plague.

241
01:02:34,047 --> 01:02:39,599
Let one boy and one girl live 
to keep our race alive.

242
01:02:49,207 --> 01:02:51,243
Do you swear?

243
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:23,561
Swear it on the Bible!

244
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:59,725
What happened dear?

245
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:07,885
Hans loves her. 
And he always will.

246
01:06:09,447 --> 01:06:15,920
So you didn't kill her?
-  I can't.

247
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:24,366
If I did, Hans might die of sadness.

248
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,643
And where would that leave me?

249
01:06:29,647 --> 01:06:32,400
Die of sadness?

250
01:06:34,287 --> 01:06:41,796
Hans seems quite strange 
if such a death awaits him.

251
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:45,477
Yes, he is.

252
01:06:49,847 --> 01:06:55,205
But that's why I love him. 
Do you understand?

253
01:06:57,727 --> 01:07:03,597
Maybe. Right now, I'm an old hag.

254
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:12,277
But I once waited for a boy 
to climb into my hayloft.

255
01:07:12,447 --> 01:07:14,563
Did he?

256
01:08:42,647 --> 01:08:49,564
Did you come to cheat me
 as well, you scoundrel?

257
01:08:50,607 --> 01:08:53,917
I'll give your kratt a soul

258
01:08:54,087 --> 01:08:59,605
and in return I get yours.

259
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:07,078
Now your blood is mine!
 Here is the soul for your kratt.

260
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:26,360
Greetings, Master! 
And blessed be your home!

261
01:09:36,887 --> 01:09:38,957
I have a job for you.

262
01:09:46,927 --> 01:09:51,000
I am truly sorry to disappoint you Master.

263
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,681
But kratts cannot carry people.

264
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:58,477
You created me for nothing
 and I regret my shortcomings.

265
01:09:58,647 --> 01:10:05,246
I would like nothing more than to
 bring two loving hearts together.

266
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:09,365
Is she enchanting,
 your beloved?

267
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:16,080
Enchanting? No. She is pretty.

268
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:24,238
I can imagine. 
Skin like white marble, lips like velvet,

269
01:10:24,407 --> 01:10:30,243
eyes deep like two dark springs 
where the water is bewitched

270
01:10:30,407 --> 01:10:33,683
and drinking it makes you lose your mind.

271
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:37,396
Where did you learn
 to talk like that kratt?

272
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:44,803
Everywhere. I flowed through old cities as a river,

273
01:10:44,967 --> 01:10:49,597
I burbled in splendid gardens 
as a fountain,

274
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:55,285
I fell as rain and carried countless ships.

275
01:10:55,447 --> 01:11:00,726
Now l am snow and for the first time I have the ability to speak

276
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:04,562
through the mouth you gave me, Master!

277
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:14,637
Well, Hans, what is this?

278
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:17,002
Building snowmen like a child?

279
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:24,918
This snowman is my kratt.

280
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:29,916
You won't believe the stories he tells.

281
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:59,038
Until a few months ago,
 I lapped along the Venetian canals

282
01:11:59,207 --> 01:12:03,723
and a gondola carried
 two lovers over me.

283
01:12:26,087 --> 01:12:29,045
This is for you, for being so divine.

284
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:36,806
Now it is time for us to part ways. 
We will never see each other again.

285
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:43,839
Let this ring remind you of me.

286
01:12:44,007 --> 01:12:45,679
I don't buy it.

287
01:12:46,887 --> 01:12:51,915
If he was leaving, 
why did he give her his ring?

288
01:12:52,087 --> 01:12:53,725
Was he stupid or something?

289
01:13:02,687 --> 01:13:07,477
If I cannot have you, 
then I do not need your ring!

290
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:40,680
Maybe we can still find that ring?
 I'll go look.

291
01:13:48,487 --> 01:13:51,957
Unbelievable stories!

292
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:58,722
They're so enchanting.

293
01:14:09,207 --> 01:14:12,643
Enchanting? 
Where did you hear that word?

294
01:14:16,647 --> 01:14:20,799
Do you want to take a wife? That's easy.

295
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:26,080
It's about time we had a wedding
 and got to gorge ourselves.

296
01:14:26,247 --> 01:14:31,002
The woman... She's the baroness.

297
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:53,636
You know very well why I'm here.

298
01:14:53,807 --> 01:14:56,924
I didn't come to warm my arse, I want to marry Liina.

299
01:14:57,087 --> 01:15:00,363
I don't have time to wank off.

300
01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:02,836
We made a deal at the pub.

301
01:15:03,007 --> 01:15:05,999
So let's finish the booze and that's that.

302
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:16,320
Drink this, it'll make your fur shine.

303
01:15:20,327 --> 01:15:21,806
I brought you a roll.

304
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:26,279
Eat your own rolls! 
And I hope you choke on them!

305
01:15:26,447 --> 01:15:31,680
Calm down.
 Endel is a good man.

306
01:15:31,847 --> 01:15:34,520
But he doesn't stand for this behavior.

307
01:15:49,687 --> 01:15:55,080
Go away! 
- You can't escape Endel.

308
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:57,397
I'm your father and l decide.

309
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:18,922
You don't have to get married. You can simply love.

310
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:25,117
I have seen plenty of young
 men who cannot marry their loves

311
01:17:26,967 --> 01:17:30,437
and write beautiful poetry about it.

312
01:17:30,607 --> 01:17:33,804
And when the lovers part ways,

313
01:17:33,967 --> 01:17:39,246
a dagger finds its way
 into the lover's heart.

314
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:04,040
I came to ask you for help.

315
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:09,440
Liina came to me. She's very sick.

316
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:14,886
She's in love with a man 
who doesn't know it.

317
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:21,402
A man who loves another.

318
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:33,880
Sander! We can't let love destroy them.

319
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:38,757
I don't remember anyone going nuts 
over something so insignificant.

320
01:18:43,527 --> 01:18:49,796
I was ready to eat poison toad when you courted another girl.

321
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:51,241
Did you?

322
01:18:57,607 --> 01:19:03,557
Oh, Minna...
 I caused you pain back in the day.

323
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:09,199
I did the same to you. 
- My wife...?

324
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,362
Yes, of course.

325
01:19:24,287 --> 01:19:27,324
Don't bear a grudge.

326
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,206
It's in the past. Let it be.

327
01:20:11,727 --> 01:20:14,161
I feel sorry for you two.

328
01:20:15,927 --> 01:20:19,237
Why is your path so rocky?

329
01:20:19,407 --> 01:20:22,205
You seem meant for each other.

330
01:20:22,367 --> 01:20:25,279
The two of you with your frozen souls.

331
01:20:27,487 --> 01:20:29,603
I'm not jealous.

332
01:20:31,607 --> 01:20:37,159
I close my eyes and pretend 
his words are meant for me.

333
01:20:39,967 --> 01:20:43,437
I know that the baroness 
will never hear them.

334
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:49,603
Poor Hans.

335
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:01,843
Liina, listen.

336
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:07,639
Do you have a dress 
that the baroness might wear?

337
01:21:10,127 --> 01:21:14,803
Why? I could get one.

338
01:21:40,807 --> 01:21:45,403
So this is the kratt 
who's been pinching our treasure.

339
01:22:33,447 --> 01:22:35,403
Damn it!

340
01:22:39,967 --> 01:22:41,958
Do not try to hold on!

341
01:22:42,847 --> 01:22:45,315
I am the crumbling sand.

342
01:22:45,487 --> 01:22:49,526
Before the morning dawn
 I will be gone from your hand.

343
01:22:52,047 --> 01:22:54,607
Do not try to understand.

344
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:57,998
I am a primordial being.

345
01:22:58,167 --> 01:23:02,638
Shining down divinely, 
in every form and feeling.

346
01:23:03,727 --> 01:23:09,085
I am the echo of an angel. I am true Love.

347
01:23:10,247 --> 01:23:16,163
Wherever you may need me I am in your heart, my dove!

348
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:22,996
That's good.

349
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:28,002
If Sander brings us together,
 I'll recite it for her.

350
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:30,920
You can do that.

351
01:23:31,087 --> 01:23:36,719
But it is much more endearing 
when a beau writes the poem himself.

352
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:45,197
I have to write the poem?
 I don't know how.

353
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:49,876
Imagine your beloved.

354
01:23:51,887 --> 01:23:55,960
The poem will write itself, trust me!

355
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:33,364
You breathe like a calf... 
Like a small cow.

356
01:24:36,727 --> 01:24:41,005
How's that?
 -Very good.

357
01:24:44,407 --> 01:24:50,118
Old pastor Moses caught me
 scraping gold from the altar.

358
01:24:56,607 --> 01:25:00,486
He said he would send me to the gallows.

359
01:25:01,807 --> 01:25:06,005
Why were you scraping it?

360
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:11,002
You know the altar is sacred.
 - Of course! It's sacred gold.

361
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:16,525
If I pay with it at the pub, 
the gold will return to my pocket.

362
01:25:19,527 --> 01:25:25,238
How will it return? Will it walk?

363
01:25:25,407 --> 01:25:28,524
Jesus will bring it. It's sacred gold.

364
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:32,566
Who told you that?
 -A Latvian.

365
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:38,916
Latvians have an arse for a mouth
and only shit comes out of it.

366
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:53,046
What's your plan?
 To poison the pastor?

367
01:25:53,207 --> 01:25:59,157
No, why? He's the hand that feeds me. 
Let's turn him stupid.

368
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:02,519
I brought some of his hair.

369
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:11,842
Have mercy... Have mercy...

370
01:26:14,327 --> 01:26:17,205
That's enough. We don't want him too dumb.

371
01:26:17,367 --> 01:26:19,881
They'll only send a new one 
and he'll probably be worse.

372
01:26:20,847 --> 01:26:24,999
I'm going home to bed. I was up all night drinking.

373
01:26:29,447 --> 01:26:34,202
What do you want? You can see I'm busy.

374
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:39,958
I heard... Maybe you have... Well...

375
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:46,918
What do I have? Speak up, don't mumble.

376
01:26:47,087 --> 01:26:50,079
A love potion.

377
01:26:51,767 --> 01:26:56,158
A potion that makes a girl love you.

378
01:26:57,967 --> 01:27:00,959
You have to make the potion.

379
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:07,963
Mix your sweat 
and armpit hairs with your shit.

380
01:27:08,127 --> 01:27:12,245
And that's your love potion.

381
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:19,995
Feed it to her 
and she'll fall for you.

382
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:34,358
Beautiful!

383
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:46,923
My name is Hans.

384
01:29:17,687 --> 01:29:19,962
You're not cold, are you?

385
01:30:17,567 --> 01:30:20,877
Two fools.

386
01:30:36,927 --> 01:30:39,600
Luise!

387
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:59,441
Look Luise, l brought you a gift.

388
01:30:59,607 --> 01:31:01,245
I baked it myself.

389
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,357
Why does it stink?

390
01:31:13,247 --> 01:31:18,401
It's shit.
 - No, it's not. It's... Chocolate.

391
01:31:20,527 --> 01:31:22,597
That is shit.

392
01:31:26,487 --> 01:31:28,842
I made it for Luise.

393
01:31:32,047 --> 01:31:35,676
You disgusting creature! 
Eat your own shit!

394
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:42,799
Those are real feelings.

395
01:32:38,247 --> 01:32:40,602
This man shot Jesus!

396
01:33:36,047 --> 01:33:39,483
My God, you can't melt!

397
01:33:39,647 --> 01:33:42,366
I have to, it must be so.

398
01:33:43,647 --> 01:33:48,675
I understand you perfectly 
even when you are silent.

399
01:33:48,847 --> 01:33:53,318
I have heard many passionate promises 
and seen storms of emotion,

400
01:33:53,487 --> 01:33:59,323
but here sat two lovers in silence.

401
01:33:59,487 --> 01:34:01,284
And it was beautiful.

402
01:34:01,447 --> 01:34:04,678
Do you really think that she... 
- I'm certain of it.

403
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:09,357
That girl loves you...

404
01:36:02,407 --> 01:36:07,527
Where is your kratt?
 - It melted.

405
01:36:07,687 --> 01:36:09,723
Then it is time to pay!

406
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:36,318
Hans!

407
01:37:29,007 --> 01:37:32,124
Your kind is a burden on humanity!

408
01:37:32,287 --> 01:37:35,120
You don't think twice 
before cutting our throats.

409
01:37:35,287 --> 01:37:42,523
It's your own fault! Who told you 
to make a deal with the Devil?

410
01:37:42,687 --> 01:37:48,125
Right, we should avoid your kind. We should set you all on fire!

411
01:38:27,327 --> 01:38:31,161
You fool the plague and the Devil

412
01:38:31,327 --> 01:38:36,765
but you don't want to pay 
with your soul as promised!

413
01:38:48,927 --> 01:38:50,679
But I don't have a soul.

414
01:38:53,647 --> 01:38:57,959
You'll be boiling 
in my cauldron soon enough.

415
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:27,919
You went to the manor pantry yesterday.

416
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:31,682
You could've grabbed a dress. It doesn't weigh anything.

417
01:39:31,847 --> 01:39:35,078
Shame on you! I got a sausage and half a lamb!

418
01:39:35,247 --> 01:39:36,760
Where would I put the dress?

419
01:39:36,927 --> 01:39:38,360
Over your shoulder.
 - Hush!

420
01:39:38,527 --> 01:39:41,121
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

421
01:39:41,287 --> 01:39:44,882
have mercy on this soul sold to Satan.

422
01:39:45,047 --> 01:39:48,244
May your blood wash us of our sins.

423
01:40:08,807 --> 01:40:14,359
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, 
have mercy!

424
01:40:19,567 --> 01:40:22,286
Have mercy on us, the sinners!

425
01:42:33,727 --> 01:42:38,357
Gold!

426
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:40,483
Pure gold!

427
01:43:00,247 --> 01:43:02,920
It's the buried Rääk treasure!

428
01:43:28,967 --> 01:43:31,925
Take this, child.

429
01:43:32,087 --> 01:43:34,999
It'll make a nice dowry for a virgin bride.

430
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:41,003
Oh, yes, 
just what a virgin bride dreams of.
