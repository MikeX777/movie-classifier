00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,864
<i>Dream, Dream</i>

2
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:37,056
You got a light?

3
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:40,760
Yeah.

4
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,732
Charlie Bronson.

5
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,078
You look just like him.

6
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:57,731
Bye.

7
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:01,662
Ok, Charlie. Ok, Goodbye.

8
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,014
Charlie Bronson.

9
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,090
Ok, baby.

10
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,039
Oh my god!

11
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,983
Today, in the bar "La Ilusión"
in Three Corners,

12
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,223
A big show,

13
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,313
Mario "The Curly One"
and his talking dummy,

14
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:19,669
Today, in the bar "La Ilusión,"
in Three Corners, a big show

15
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,300
Mario "The Curly One"
and his talking dummy,

16
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,105
Ok, baby.

17
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:00,227
Thank you, thank you,
Thank you very much.

18
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:05,438
And now we're off to old Paris.

19
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,471
Turn off the lights.

20
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,509
- By the great Aznavour
- Mario...

21
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,013
Hey Mario, over here...

22
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,969
- Do you remember me?
- Yes, Charlie.

23
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,580
He calls me that
because I look like Bronson.

24
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:22,544
Huh?

25
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,521
I said, he calls me that
because I look like Bronson.

26
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,660
- Huh?
- Nothing, nothing

27
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:32,717
<i> It's better like that
Turn off the lights</i>

28
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:37,204
<i>In the darkness of your youth</i>

29
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,860
<i>Tell me the truth</i>

30
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:43,928
<i>I know Paris sleeps fearlessly</i>

31
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:48,496
<i>While our hearts burn vis-à-vis</i>

32
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,338
Say it fast, Charlie, firmly
and without hesitation!

33
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,216
If an elephant fell in the water,
how would it come out?

34
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,238
- Uh, I don't know?
- Wet!

35
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:58,186
Charlie, Charlie, answer fast,
firmly, and without hesitation

36
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:02,874
How do you get all of the women
in the world to follow you?

37
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:06,320
I don't know.

38
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,468
Walk in front of them!

39
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:16,922
Charlie, Charlie, answer fast,
firmly, and without hesitation

40
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,748
What's the first thing a cow
makes when the sun comes up?

41
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:21,849
I don't know.

42
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,776
A shadow.

43
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,235
What time does the bus to
the city leave?

44
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,411
I don't know, I think around 4.

45
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,946
- Are you leaving?
- Mhm.

46
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:16,464
I've been meaning to
ask you something.

47
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,208
When you said I look like
Charlie Bronson...

48
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,203
Were you serious?

49
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:28,471
Yeah, I'm serious.
If I were as handsome as you,

50
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,501
I wouldn't spend another
minute in this small town.

51
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,421
What do you have to do?

52
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:43,430
To do what?

53
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,369
To do that, to be an artist.

54
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,714
How should I know?

55
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,258
Leave!

56
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:56,083
Leave for Buenos Aires.

57
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,656
Oh yeah, of course.
Buenos Aires.

58
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:08,040
The thing is, I'm so happy here.

59
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:12,823
I work at Town Hall.

60
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:16,937
On top of the... salary,
they give me two suits per year.

61
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,812
One in the winter,
another one in the summer.

62
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,068
And they let me use the bicycle.

63
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:33,062
Two suits? Two suits per year?

64
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:35,202
Are you nuts?

65
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,801
We're talking about art, fame,
thousands of dollars.

66
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,199
And you come up with two suits!

67
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,901
Oh, of course.

68
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,523
And how do you get started?

69
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,713
Get what started?

70
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,523
That, being an artist.

71
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,462
The first thing you need
is a stage name.

72
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,841
If you ask me...

73
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:18,235
- Charlie Bronson!
- Yeah, but there's one already.

74
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,631
Right...
But as my name is Carlos too...

75
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:25,720
It's OK, but it's not happening.

76
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,436
I've always liked the idea
of being an artist.

77
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:37,109
I've already been in the
paper El Pueblo once.

78
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:39,956
Look. You see?

79
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,332
I got kicked by a horse.

80
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,570
It says right there.

81
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:49,373
"Our neighbor, Carlos Irrazábal
was kicked by a horse."

82
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:50,874
That's great.

83
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:53,900
- With a photo and everything!
- How great is that?

84
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:56,343
That's when I got the
job at Town Hall.

85
00:10:57,888 --> 00:11:00,707
You see?
Because I got kicked by a horse.

86
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,188
- You got a light?
- Yeah, yeah.

87
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,772
Thanks.

88
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,404
You know what?
I've been meaning to tell you...

89
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:27,714
If you want, I can invite
you to sleep in my room.

90
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:31,085
After all, you don't have
a show tomorrow.

91
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,165
I wouldn't want to bother you.

92
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,753
Oh no, no problem at all.

93
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:41,846
It's not 5 stars, but...

94
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,043
It used to be my Mom's bed.

95
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,283
I'm going to get it ready for you.

96
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,180
- Could you give me a hand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,006
Thanks.

98
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,132
There won't be any trouble
with the neighbors, right?

99
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:06,159
The closest hotel is 3 blocks away.

100
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:11,631
- You're gonna sing?
- No, no, I don't sing.

101
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:15,053
- I lip sync.
- Ba dum chhh.

102
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:24,542
- Coffee?
- Sure.

103
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:04,158
- Can I watch?
- Hmm?

104
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,102
- Is it OK if I watch?
- Mhm.

105
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:24,467
What's that for?

106
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:29,009
- What's "that"?
- That.

107
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,409
For my curls.

108
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:37,953
That's what I'm known for.

109
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:41,292
It's my persona.

110
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:49,727
You know everything.

111
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,729
Mine are like wires.

112
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:02,804
That's how hard they are.

113
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:12,033
I use gallons of gel,
but they're still that hard.

114
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,873
That's how hard they are!

115
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,961
- Coffee?
- Sure.

116
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:53,343
1... 2... 3...

117
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,299
Do you have any extra ones?

118
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:18,539
Can I offer you some
constructive criticism?

119
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:20,151
About what?

120
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,115
About the ventriloquist's
dummy thing.

121
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,761
In the picture,
you're with the dummy.

122
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:28,991
But you didn't have it
at the show.

123
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:31,539
No, the thing is...

124
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:36,099
Back when they took the photo,

125
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,741
I was working with a dwarf.

126
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,535
I was working as
a ventriloquist.

127
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:52,499
I used to go on stage carrying
a suitcase with the dwarf inside.

128
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,737
All the while, the lights were dim.

129
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,140
I would open the suitcase,
and the dwarf would jump out.

130
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:04,870
That dwarf was a genius.

131
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,127
- Polvorita!
- Yes?

132
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:10,290
- Do you trust your girlfriend?
- Of course I trust my girlfriend!

133
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,461
- Why do you trust your girlfriend?
- Well, because I believe her.

134
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:15,961
- Does your girlfriend love you?
- Of course she loves me.

135
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:18,315
- And where is she right now?
- She must be at home.

136
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:22,286
No, sir, the other day she was seen
buying eggs at the general store.

137
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,854
- Of course, to cook with.
- But they were golden eggs.

138
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:27,825
- Of course, she went to buy them.
- But the shopkeeper wasn't there.

139
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:30,062
- So, who'd she buy them from?
- The jeweler.

140
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,757
Oh really?

141
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:39,482
<i>Turn off the lights,
Jasmine and carnations</i>

142
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:44,264
<i>My crossed arms
dream of your skin</i>

143
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:48,876
<i>Stop the clock,
Come closer to me</i>

144
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:53,425
<i>Only you and me,
It's better like this</i>

145
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:59,958
<i>Turn off the lights,
And in the darkness of your youth</i>

146
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:02,823
<i>Tell me the truth</i>

147
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,044
Those were my finest moments.

148
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,764
I bought all that stuff back then.

149
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:23,711
And what happened?

150
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:26,606
It went to his head.

151
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,460
All of the success
went to his head.

152
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,284
That's what always happens.

153
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:47,770
You work hard, invent them
a persona, make them famous,

154
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:51,391
And when success comes?

155
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,204
Bye. They say, "Haven't I
seen you somewhere before?"

156
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,338
I would never do such a thing.

157
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,928
Everybody loves me here.

158
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:13,780
Because I'm a good friend.

159
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,538
When I lost my Mom
a little while ago,

160
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,865
A ton of people came to the wake.

161
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:22,729
A ton!

162
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:30,643
Mother! Your name is everything.

163
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,791
I cry before your tomb,
And I bless you with my life

164
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:39,537
Who doesn't feel protected
by your sacred name?

165
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:43,282
Only he who has lost you
knows your value

166
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:47,095
I cry because I don't have you

167
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:50,391
I laugh because I have had you

168
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:54,512
And now that I've lost you,
I wonder why

169
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,044
Why did God take
her away from me?

170
00:19:57,746 --> 00:20:00,002
Why this infinite pain?

171
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,905
A mother is like a blazon

172
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,643
A mother is everything in life

173
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,841
A mother is a heart

174
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:13,745
A mother is a torrent of tears

175
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:17,286
And a mother is forgiveness
if we lose our way

176
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,060
Ay, mother, I get on my knees

177
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,578
And ask for your blessing

178
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:39,701
Mario...

179
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,261
Huh? What?

180
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:53,997
The poem was beautiful.
Who wrote it?

181
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:59,787
- It's mine.
- I'd like to write it down.

182
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,331
Carlitos, you came.

183
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:51,220
I came to say goodbye, Mom.

184
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:55,708
I'm going to Buenos Aires
to work as an artist.

185
00:21:55,976 --> 00:22:00,140
To Buenos Aires!
To work as an artist!

186
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:03,823
I always wanted to
be an artist, Mom.

187
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,959
Let's go tell your Aunts!

188
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:14,085
Oh no, Mom! Not the Aunts!

189
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:17,492
They're dead, they scare me!

190
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:25,419
Don't say that about your Aunts,
poor thing, they love you so.

191
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:33,801
Not the aunts, they're dead,
they scare me.

192
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:38,170
Genoveva! Custodia!
Come here, come here!

193
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:42,815
Carlitos is going to Buenos Aires
to work as an artist!

194
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:44,891
Come here!

195
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:50,366
Carlitos is going to Buenos Aires
to work as an artist!

196
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:54,078
Carlitos is going to Buenos Aires.

197
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:16,876
Mario...

198
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,252
Mario...

199
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:26,716
Huh, what?

200
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,394
It's me.

201
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,188
- What time is it?
- It's 6.

202
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:39,668
What are you doing up
this early?

203
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm making breakfast,
I'm going to work.

204
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,358
- What is that for?
- What?

205
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:56,608
Your glasses.

206
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,288
- Do they look bad?
- No, just saying.

207
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:06,052
- Are they for your persona?
- No, no.

208
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:13,412
It's just that I have round eyes.
They're small, like a little pig's.

209
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,247
Like my gramps.

210
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:24,357
But when I make enough money,
I'm going to get surgery.

211
00:24:25,126 --> 00:24:29,305
They're going to look like this,
like Omar Sharif.

212
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:32,271
You know everything, huh?

213
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:49,807
I've got a surprise for you.

214
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:54,804
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

215
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,426
Good morning, Don Toto.

216
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,826
Carlitos, what happened to you?

217
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:06,916
Nothing, why? I'm going to Buenos
Aires to work as an artist.

218
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:08,908
Oh, good for you.

219
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,922
Say, Don Toto, you wanted to
buy my little plot, right?

220
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:17,549
Good morning... Good morning...

221
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:22,527
Good morning... Good morning...

222
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:51,420
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

223
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,461
- Is something wrong, Carlos?
- No, nothing, sir. Why?

224
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,895
No, it's nothing. I'm listening.

225
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:05,939
Well sir, I, I was thinking,
I came to say goodbye.

226
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,099
Because I'm going to Buenos
Aires to work as an artist.

227
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:15,689
Carlitos is off to Buenos Aires
to work as an artist, Carlitos!

228
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,220
Carlitos is off to Buenos Aires
to work as an artist!

229
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:28,209
Carlitos is off to Buenos Aires
to work as an artist, Carlitos!

230
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:59,541
<i>Stay here! Stay here!</i>

231
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,661
Shut up!

232
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:08,158
Mario.

233
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:16,214
This is from my plot.
I sold it.

234
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:19,500
I want you to keep it.

235
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:24,076
- Because it's for both of us.
- Why?

236
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:26,549
Why...?

237
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,593
Alright Charlie, it's OK.

238
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:35,251
Carlitos, look at you!

239
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:42,601
<i>Stay here! Stay here!</i>

240
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:58,735
I... I...

241
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,727
Never had a father, or a mother.

242
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:12,847
That is to say, I lost them.

243
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:17,673
The town hall...

244
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:23,623
Was my mother and father.

245
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:32,579
And although I had a job,
they gave me two suits

246
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:38,515
One in the winter,
another in the summer,

247
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,931
And they lent me the bicycle.

248
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:47,307
I never changed, never!

249
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:51,373
I was always the same
for my friends.

250
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,555
I didn't change when I got the job.

251
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:00,785
I was always the same
for my friends.

252
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,625
Even now that I'm going to
Buenos Aires to work as an artist,

253
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:11,518
I'm still going to remember you.

254
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:14,890
I will never forget you.

255
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:17,220
Never!

256
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,384
Take care of the bicycle.
It's yours now.

257
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,447
Rosita! Rosita!

258
00:29:56,154 --> 00:29:58,298
You didn't love me, huh?

259
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,098
Now you're gonna see who I am!
Now you're gonna see who I am!

260
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:22,851
Rosita! This is for you!

261
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,241
Mom...

262
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:49,263
Long live my country!

263
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,831
Mario...

264
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:13,926
Mario! Mario!

265
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,562
- So you made it?
- You have to take me with you!

266
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:23,163
Please, please!

267
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:25,209
I gave you a note saying that
I'd wait for you here.

268
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:27,411
- That's a lie!
- It's true!

269
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:32,003
You have to take me please,
they already sent me off.

270
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:37,252
Please, they already sent me off.

271
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:47,130
- Speak, answer.
- Lady.

272
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,098
- Speak, answer now.
- Baby.

273
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:52,150
- Don't hesitate, Charlie.
- Red.

274
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:56,372
- Answer, speak.
- Coat.

275
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:59,507
- Now, answer, speak.
- Young.

276
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,786
- Speak, answer now.
- Gentleman.

277
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,544
- Without delay...
- Child.

278
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,264
- Answer.
- Handbag.

279
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,566
- Answer, speak.
- Blue.

280
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,889
- Repeat it, Charlie.
- Coat.

281
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:20,661
- Speak, answer now.
- Fur coat.

282
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,667
- Answer me, tell me now.
- Brown.

283
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,443
- Think, Charlie. Don't answer, think.
- Child.

284
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,303
- Don't waver, Charlie, answer.
- Mr.

285
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:50,835
- Think, don't answer, Charlie.
- Red.

286
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:54,523
- What're you waiting for, Charlie?
- Blue.

287
00:34:55,997 --> 00:35:00,199
- Think, Charlie. Don't answer, think.
- Brown.

288
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:06,975
- Think, Charlie, answer.
- Old man.

289
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:12,729
- What're you waiting for, Charlie?
- Old man.

290
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,423
- Say it, Charlie.
- Baby.

291
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:23,913
- Should we call a doctor?
- Don't worry. Take this.

292
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:29,582
The House of Horror, with the fattest
electrocuted person in the world,

293
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:32,106
The decapitated woman,
with blood, lots of blood,

294
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:33,830
Mixed with oriental beauty.

295
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:36,348
Come and see, come and see,
ladies and gentelmen,

296
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:39,570
Come and see the House of Horror,
with the fattest electrocuted...

297
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:18,591
This is incredible, people!
We have here Manzour

298
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,427
The Cossack prince and the
Queen of Siberia!

299
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:24,813
And the most spectacular
acrobats of the century!

300
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,680
Come, people! It's a show
worth seeing!

301
00:36:38,288 --> 00:36:44,279
<i>Beautiful girl, the rarest pearl
in all of Jalisco and Guadalajara</i>

302
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:50,032
Balancing acts, ponies, clowns,
take a good look.

303
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,097
Dog weddings, the one and only,
come, ladies and gentlemen,

304
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:56,573
Come and see our special show,
Balancing acts, ponies, clowns...

305
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:21,117
Come see the talking dummy!
Come and see!

306
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:25,917
Ritar, the Gypsy prince, the dwarf
Polvorita and his great gypsy ballet!

307
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:28,372
Charlie, the Memory Cowboy,

308
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,040
Will respond firmly
and without hesitation

309
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,362
To each of your queries.

310
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:40,066
Your hopes and dreams
will become reality.

311
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:47,116
The reality of an unknown world,
truly mysterious, and truly magical.

312
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:50,879
And to lead us to
this magical world...

313
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:54,680
- Hey, careful with that gun...
- Quiet, jerk, we're working here.

314
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,540
As I was saying, to lead you to
this unknown and magical world,

315
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:07,228
Will be the steadying hand of
Mario, the Curly One.

316
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:09,420
The European.

317
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,616
Ok, Charlie. Concentrate.

318
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,135
Are you concentrating, Charlie?

319
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:23,663
Of course, my brother.

320
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:27,916
Let's go, Charlie. Kazam!

321
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:31,652
Thank you. Concentrate, Charlie.

322
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:33,864
Ok, speak, fast, firmly and
without hesitations,

323
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:36,144
Who am I in front of
and what do I have in my hand?

324
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:40,930
C'mon Charlie, concentrate.

325
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:43,165
Who am I in front of
and what do I have in my hand?

326
00:38:45,997 --> 00:38:48,645
Answer, Charlie, fast, firmly
and without hesitations.

327
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:51,557
Who am I in front of
and what do I have in my hand?

328
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,905
Good, Charlie. Thank you.

329
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:08,374
Firmly and without hesitation,
Charlie, answer fast.

330
00:39:08,673 --> 00:39:10,742
What color is this man's blazer?

331
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:16,114
C'mon Charlie, firmly and
without hesitation,

332
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:17,990
What color is the man's blazer?

333
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,430
Don't think about it, Charlie,
don't think about it.

334
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:28,996
What color is the man's blazer?
Concentrate.

335
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:33,376
C'mon Charlie, concentrate.
What color is the man's blazer?

336
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,248
- Hurry up, would you? I'm on now.
- Wait a minute, we're working here.

337
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:42,161
C'mon Charlie, concentrate.
What color is the man's blazer?

338
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,521
He can't see.

339
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:47,129
No, people, we can't work like this.

340
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:52,723
Charlie, don't think any more,
what color is the man's blazer?

341
00:39:57,305 --> 00:39:59,817
What color is the man's blazer?

342
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:18,705
I forgot.

343
00:40:20,473 --> 00:40:22,865
How did you forget?
Motherfucker.

344
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:45,937
Charlie...

345
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,471
Come here.

346
00:41:13,945 --> 00:41:17,317
It's over. The past is the past.

347
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:24,547
I forgive you, OK?
Sit down.

348
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:32,817
I'm not mad at you.

349
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:37,107
I've already forgiven you.

350
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,883
Would you be willing
to swallow swords?

351
00:41:59,966 --> 00:42:03,851
- Swallow what?
- Swords, it's the easiest there is.

352
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,191
You stand like this.

353
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:10,997
The sword doesn't have a blade.

354
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:15,055
And you swallow the whole thing.

355
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,209
It's easy, and there's no danger.

356
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:23,001
- And why don't you swallow it?
- Because I'm your presenter.

357
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:28,787
No, no, I'm not swallowing it.
If you want, I'll present you.

358
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:34,984
You, present me?
Moron! Indian!

359
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:39,964
I'm an Indian?
And what are you? European!

360
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:42,661
Io sono europeo!

361
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:48,993
- I wish I had the dwarf...
- Go find the dwarf!

362
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:52,961
You always bring up the dwarf!
Go find the dwarf!

363
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:55,676
You're always insulting me!

364
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:06,732
I'll take a double hot chocolate and
6 croissants with jelly and butter.

365
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:12,036
For him, a coffee. Black.

366
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,076
No, sir. I will also take a double
hot chocolate with croissants!

367
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,099
Here in Argentina, you don't eat
if you don't work.

368
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:01,156
The money is mine,
it's from the plot.

369
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:03,823
You spent the money from the
plot on your pneumonia.

370
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,607
I caught pneumonia when I went
looking for you at the station.

371
00:44:07,138 --> 00:44:08,782
Because you were leaving
with my money!

372
00:44:09,158 --> 00:44:12,230
No, sir. I left you a note telling
you to wait at the station.

373
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:17,293
You're lying.

374
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:29,019
You don't love me, then.

375
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:33,509
But of course I love you.

376
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:38,205
Who took care of you when
you got pneumonia?

377
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:41,669
You.

378
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:43,696
So...

379
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,770
Why do you say that I don't
love you?

380
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:50,209
Why do you always bring up
the dwarf, huh?

381
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:56,195
-Why?
-Because you don't want to work.

382
00:44:56,494 --> 00:45:01,534
But I don't want to
swallow swords, you know?

383
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:09,071
It's scary. I'm like this
because of the pneumonia.

384
00:45:12,272 --> 00:45:14,336
That's why I can't remember
anything, you know?

385
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:23,948
Do you want to rehearse again?

386
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:30,917
Weren't you the one who said
that I look like Charlie Bronson?

387
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,628
Alright.

388
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,978
We're going to rehearse again.

389
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:42,697
OK, but don't mention
the dwarf again.

390
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:47,440
Alright.

391
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,232
The past is the past.

392
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,105
Waiter! He'll have a hot
chocolate too.

393
00:45:58,137 --> 00:46:00,210
- Speak, answer.
- Red.

394
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,324
Come here. Lorena, come here!

395
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:19,360
I said come here, Lorena.

396
00:46:20,098 --> 00:46:22,446
If you don't come here,
we're never coming back again.

397
00:46:26,932 --> 00:46:30,552
Mario... Mario...

398
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,522
I'm falling asleep, Mario.

399
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,624
I'm fainting from hunger,
I can't take it anymore.

400
00:48:43,993 --> 00:48:46,509
Thief! Thief!

401
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:49,905
After the thief!

402
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:55,303
After the thief!

403
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:58,573
Please, everybody after the thief!

404
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:05,573
Help, I've been robbed by a thief!

405
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:09,691
After the thief!

406
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:12,306
Scumbag!

407
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,562
Help! Everybody after the thief!

408
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:27,962
Where did the furball go?

409
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:31,028
Tell me, where is your bearded
friend? Where is he?

410
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,057
- I didn't do anything, sir!
- Where is he? Answer me!

411
00:49:34,969 --> 00:49:37,556
Come on, answer me!
Where is the furball?

412
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:43,068
There's a thief over there, a thief.

413
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,472
Dimwit! Where have you been?

414
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:38,821
What happened to you?

415
00:50:47,395 --> 00:50:49,039
I've been waiting for you.

416
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,969
Want to eat?

417
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,486
What's the matter with you?

418
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:09,676
- Bye.
- Bye.

419
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:26,429
Thief! Thief! That's the
tip of the iceberg!

420
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,668
- Scream softly!
- Thief!

421
00:52:28,669 --> 00:52:30,724
- Shut your mouth!
- I'm not shutting anything,

422
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,874
- That's the tip of the iceberg!
- Shut your mouth!

423
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:35,827
What is my dead mother
going to say?

424
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,611
I'm killing myself!
Me, a thief!

425
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:44,024
Go on, kill yourself, but don't
scream. Let me eat!

426
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:49,828
I'm going to jump and kill myself.
I'm going to kill myself!

427
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:12,242
Mario... Mario...

428
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:15,312
Look, Mario.

429
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:51,646
It's been so long since
I've been with a woman.

430
00:53:57,874 --> 00:54:02,406
The artist was born to fly.

431
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:07,921
Women, children...

432
00:54:09,506 --> 00:54:12,386
They're an obstacle.

433
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,834
Stay calm.

434
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:21,998
Stay calm and stick with me.
I know all this very well.

435
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:24,697
Yeah, but I feel bad.

436
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:32,072
I need to go to the
bathroom, Mario.

437
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:44,577
Look, that brunette over there
is the most...

438
00:54:58,683 --> 00:55:04,211
You, you, you, and you.
The rest can leave, go home.

439
00:55:15,047 --> 00:55:17,839
- Not me? Excuse me.
- No, the rest can leave.

440
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:22,296
No, I want the darkie, not you.
I want the darkie, where is he?

441
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:25,205
I brought him, I'm his brother.
I can help with the co-production.

442
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:27,597
Excuse me.

443
00:55:28,816 --> 00:55:31,268
- I told you, he's a moron.
- Darkie, come over here.

444
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:37,465
All I'm interested in is the role,
I don't care about the money.

445
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:38,926
I'm not interested in the money.

446
00:55:39,242 --> 00:55:41,157
What's going on?
Everybody's looking for you.

447
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:42,453
I didn't do anything, sir.

448
00:55:42,453 --> 00:55:43,986
"God gives bread to
those without teeth."

449
00:55:44,156 --> 00:55:46,264
Let's go, the director is waiting.

450
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:49,249
- Hurry up before he gets mad!
- Hurry up, please!

451
00:55:49,352 --> 00:55:51,624
- Can he ride a horse?
- Yes.

452
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:57,081
I'm not in it for the money.

453
00:55:59,608 --> 00:56:02,930
- Can he swim?
- Yeah, I think so.

454
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:06,772
But all I'm interested in is the role,
I don't care about the money.

455
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:11,075
You...

456
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,603
You're just like the rest.

457
00:56:16,663 --> 00:56:18,985
Like the dwarf and everyone else.

458
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,208
Now that you've made it...

459
00:56:25,824 --> 00:56:28,810
You say, "Haven't I seen
you somewhere before?"

460
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:33,993
I'm not the dwarf.
I am true to my friends.

461
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:38,078
Everybody loves me.

462
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,265
Mario, how do you do this?

463
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:08,065
Let's see...

464
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:15,861
I knew it. A role with
dialogue and everything.

465
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:28,664
<i>I'd sooner be dead than defeated.
I'd sooner be dead.</i>

466
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:33,871
<i>I'd sooner be dead than defeated.</i>

467
00:57:35,467 --> 00:57:38,899
<i>I'd sooner be dead than defeated.</i>

468
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:44,880
<i>I'd sooner be dead than...</i>

469
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,191
Than...

470
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:55,418
Than what?

471
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,362
- Than defeated?
- Yes, defeated.

472
00:58:02,693 --> 00:58:04,356
But what's the matter with you?

473
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:08,382
Don't you feel it?
Don't you have blood?

474
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:10,645
Feel it! Feel it!

475
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:13,210
<i>I'd sooner be dead than defeated!</i>

476
00:58:13,801 --> 00:58:16,544
<i>I'd sooner be dead than defeated!</i>

477
00:58:36,656 --> 00:58:38,347
You're disturbing the neighbors!

478
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,360
You were good. Really good.

479
00:58:47,177 --> 00:58:50,146
That's how you have to do it.
Like that.

480
00:58:58,553 --> 00:59:00,688
You're a prince, Carlos!

481
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,447
- You look like a prince!
- Where are they taking me?

482
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:13,798
Mario! Where are they taking me?

483
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:16,980
Don't worry, man.

484
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:21,865
- Mario!
- Don't worry!

485
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,743
Where are they taking me, Mario?

486
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:37,824
Film crew. Film crew!

487
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:42,482
Thanks.

488
00:59:43,474 --> 00:59:45,034
Motherfuckers.

489
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:53,937
Attention, hill. Tell me when the
zone 2 director's crew arrives.

490
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,197
Attention, hill. Tell me when the
zone 2 director's crew arrives.

491
01:00:05,652 --> 01:00:07,995
Attention, they're coming
with the double.

492
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,908
C'mon, baby. Let's go kid.
Step on it.

493
01:00:15,788 --> 01:00:18,068
Stay calm, give the kid the script.

494
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:19,811
- Give the kid the script.
- Stay calm.

495
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:21,303
Is there a bathroom around here?

496
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:23,742
- Here's the script, kid.
- What?

497
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:26,419
- Read the script, let's go.
- What script?

498
01:00:26,555 --> 01:00:28,783
- The script.
- The script?

499
01:00:31,643 --> 01:00:33,922
Son of a bitch, park it, man!

500
01:00:50,607 --> 01:00:52,976
Step on, get up there. Don't be
scared, you're not going to fall.

501
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:55,243
Hey kid, don't worry, we're
going to make you look good.

502
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:56,961
Hey, don't mess with him, man.

503
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:58,847
C'mon, mount, don't be afraid,
don't worry about them.

504
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:00,573
No, no, I'm not mounting.

505
01:01:01,893 --> 01:01:04,602
- Let's go, kid, mount.
- No, I don't know how.

506
01:01:04,922 --> 01:01:06,267
You don't know how?
I'm gonna kill you.

507
01:01:06,387 --> 01:01:09,664
I swear it. I don't know how.
I'm scared.

508
01:01:10,023 --> 01:01:12,193
C'mon, c'mon. Get up there.

509
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:15,654
No, sir! No, sir!

510
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:23,947
It looks like he's gotten away.

511
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:48,225
We have some tracks here.

512
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,040
Film crew!

513
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:04,293
Can you take me?

514
01:02:05,984 --> 01:02:07,383
Turtle-faced bastard.

515
01:02:35,347 --> 01:02:40,630
Attention, attention. Look
for him in zone 3.

516
01:03:45,294 --> 01:03:46,709
Charlie!

517
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,478
- What's wrong with you?
- Ay, Mario.

518
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:53,487
- C'mon.
- Ay, Mario.

519
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:00,924
Let's go. Calm down.

520
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:06,511
- Stop crying, come on.
- They wanted me to mount a horse.

521
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:10,615
If you keep it up, you're
gonna make me cry too, Charlie.

522
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,738
- Calm down.
- They want me to mount a horse.

523
01:04:26,702 --> 01:04:30,087
All you need is a little
practice, that's all.

524
01:04:36,408 --> 01:04:38,238
It's alright, Charlie.

525
01:04:39,184 --> 01:04:42,433
What's up, kid? The Italian
producer's going to fire us all.

526
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,427
I don't want to mount, sir.

527
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:47,364
He'll mount, he'll mount.
He's like a child.

528
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:52,141
What's wrong with you?
He's making us lose time.

529
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,667
It's simple. Grab the flag and jump
off the cliff with the horse and all.

530
01:04:55,865 --> 01:04:57,453
What did he say?

531
01:04:57,759 --> 01:05:02,429
It's simple. Grab the flag
and get on the horse.

532
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:08,411
And then, with the horse and all,
you jump off the cliff.

533
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,683
- Ah, shit.
- Take it easy...

534
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:15,144
How can I "take it easy,"
I can't take it easy

535
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:17,239
With all of these animals.

536
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:21,149
Let's see. He's alive.

537
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:34,201
- Mario, I didn't do anything.
- Be quiet.

538
01:05:57,877 --> 01:05:59,581
Carmen!

539
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,414
Stop, please!

540
01:06:03,063 --> 01:06:05,036
Stop! Let me through.

541
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,420
Excuse me. Carmen.
Stop, please.

542
01:06:55,703 --> 01:06:57,275
Carmen.

543
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,665
Carmen.

544
01:07:35,653 --> 01:07:38,218
Carmen, how are you?

545
01:07:44,569 --> 01:07:47,797
- How have you been?
- Fine. Can't you see I'm doing fine?

546
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:50,547
I...

547
01:07:53,506 --> 01:07:55,502
We... wanted to talk to you.

548
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:57,232
I can't now, I'm busy.

549
01:07:58,527 --> 01:08:01,150
Wait for me in the bar out front.
Bye.

550
01:08:05,212 --> 01:08:06,713
- OK.
- So long.

551
01:08:07,214 --> 01:08:08,971
Let's go, Charlie.

552
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:24,013
He's a genius.
The midget's a genius.

553
01:08:25,132 --> 01:08:27,287
If you want, I'll leave.

554
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:31,751
- No, why?
- So you can chat in peace.

555
01:08:31,883 --> 01:08:33,597
Are you crazy or something?

556
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:37,258
You're with me, right?

557
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,623
Here he comes.

558
01:08:53,944 --> 01:08:56,165
I want some bread.

559
01:09:07,052 --> 01:09:08,663
- This is...
- Waiter!

560
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,694
This is Charlie.
The Memory Cowboy.

561
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:16,137
What's up, man?

562
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:18,714
You wanted to talk to me?

563
01:09:23,477 --> 01:09:25,575
Carmen, long time no see, eh?

564
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,212
Come here!

565
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:34,951
Alright, I wanted to...

566
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:39,327
- Is there a bathroom?
- There, in the back.

567
01:09:40,236 --> 01:09:43,217
- The usual.
- No, nothing for me, I'm good.

568
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:57,109
I'm doing fine, too.

569
01:10:00,148 --> 01:10:03,032
We have some sensational
memory routines.

570
01:10:05,555 --> 01:10:07,480
We just shot a film.

571
01:10:11,004 --> 01:10:12,672
You see how handsome he is?

572
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:16,490
Charlie Bronson!

573
01:10:26,911 --> 01:10:28,163
Milk?

574
01:10:29,436 --> 01:10:33,061
Yes, milk. What did you
want to talk about?

575
01:10:39,188 --> 01:10:40,719
Carmen.

576
01:10:47,822 --> 01:10:49,311
Carmen.

577
01:10:53,599 --> 01:10:55,868
Why don't we work
together again?

578
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:00,846
Do you remember?

579
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,470
How the people used to applaud...

580
01:11:06,731 --> 01:11:09,240
How they would laugh...

581
01:11:13,057 --> 01:11:14,716
It was...

582
01:11:16,256 --> 01:11:18,475
We were destined for glory.

583
01:11:20,437 --> 01:11:21,838
And the cowboy?

584
01:11:22,893 --> 01:11:24,178
What cowboy?

585
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,935
Your friend, the cowboy.

586
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:29,507
That fool?

587
01:11:32,619 --> 01:11:36,124
No, he's a moron.
A moron.

588
01:11:36,967 --> 01:11:38,546
An Indian.

589
01:11:39,186 --> 01:11:41,141
I found him in the country.

590
01:11:42,663 --> 01:11:44,344
He's hard-headed.

591
01:11:45,478 --> 01:11:49,087
I was just telling him that
if we get back together,

592
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:52,898
He has to go.

593
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:55,093
Who's "we"?

594
01:11:57,398 --> 01:12:00,296
Us. That's what I'm saying.

595
01:12:03,191 --> 01:12:06,400
I told him that if we get
back together...

596
01:12:10,586 --> 01:12:11,769
He has to go back home.

597
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:13,873
You're always the same dirtbag.

598
01:12:14,985 --> 01:12:17,953
- What's the matter with you?
- Always the same dirtbag.

599
01:12:18,202 --> 01:12:19,698
Why do you want to work
with me?

600
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:21,638
To sell me to another circus?

601
01:12:21,966 --> 01:12:23,154
Me?

602
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,856
I didn't sell you.

603
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,454
Yes, you swapped me for 100,000
pesos and crept out in the night.

604
01:12:28,575 --> 01:12:30,324
- Me?
- Yes, you, you!

605
01:12:30,627 --> 01:12:33,840
I had to work in that circus for
one year until I escaped!

606
01:12:34,412 --> 01:12:36,792
But I swear I didn't sell you.

607
01:12:43,915 --> 01:12:45,143
The thing is...

608
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,134
They threatened me, you know.

609
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:55,270
They said they would kill me if
I didn't leave you.

610
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,857
Lies!
You lost me in a card game!

611
01:12:58,988 --> 01:13:00,107
I swear by all the saints.

612
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:02,708
What saints? Didn't you say
you were a communist?

613
01:13:02,977 --> 01:13:06,549
Me, a communist? Swear on
this that I'm a communist!

614
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:11,676
I don't know what's wrong
with me. I feel bad.

615
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:23,296
So, he's a moron? An Indian?
Why don't you say it now?

616
01:13:26,732 --> 01:13:28,844
You're nuts. I said that?

617
01:13:29,247 --> 01:13:31,102
Yeah, you said it.

618
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,765
You're a shitty little dwarf.

619
01:13:37,258 --> 01:13:40,319
An ulcerous dwarf.
No wonder you drink milk.

620
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,197
What do you think you are?
You think you're indispensable?

621
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:49,315
At every circus I've been,
I've had a ton of dwarves. A ton!

622
01:13:49,427 --> 01:13:51,506
And they were tinier than you!

623
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,910
I hope you grow up.

624
01:14:12,496 --> 01:14:14,717
So you starve to death.

625
01:14:16,525 --> 01:14:18,416
Let's go, Charlie.

626
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:43,596
You know what the
problem is, Charlie?

627
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:46,772
This country's not big
enough for us.

628
01:14:49,925 --> 01:14:52,200
- We've got to go to Europe.
- To Europe?

629
01:14:52,838 --> 01:14:56,702
Yes, to Europe, to Europe!
The actors there are all fags.

630
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:02,152
With your manly looks,
we'll knock'em all dead.

631
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:06,309
All you're missing is a little
bit of concentration.

632
01:15:07,945 --> 01:15:09,947
- What?
- No, nothing.

633
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:13,188
But how?

634
01:15:14,974 --> 01:15:17,690
Don't worry, leave it to me.

635
01:15:21,045 --> 01:15:22,433
Have I ever done you wrong?

636
01:16:42,689 --> 01:16:45,542
Firmly and without hesitation,
what is the gentleman's number?

637
01:16:46,312 --> 01:16:52,085
The gentleman has cap number
14994/33.

638
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:13,700
You see, Charlie? All we needed
was a little bit of concentration.

639
01:17:48,217 --> 01:17:52,701
Incredible, people! Come and see!
It's a show worth seeing!

640
01:17:53,164 --> 01:17:58,952
Come one and come all, people!
Right here! Come and see!

641
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,309
Ladies and gentlemen, come and see
this special show,

642
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,744
Trapeze artists, jugglers, balancing
acts, ponies, clowns, dog weddings,

643
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:07,421
The one and only in the world,
Come and see!
