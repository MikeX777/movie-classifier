1
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,490
- Hi, I'm Taylor.

2
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,050
I'm 22 years old.

3
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,983
I'm from Miami, Florida.

4
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:39,898
I think that I'm more
than perfect for the show

5
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:43,731
because I'm cute, I'm
spunky, I'm spontaneous.

6
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,477
I'll try anything once.

7
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,144
Who can so no to me?

8
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:04,650
- What's up guys?

9
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm Shawn.

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,144
There's really only three things
you need to know about me.

11
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:09,347
I'm young, I'm dumb,

12
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:12,453
and I'm full of surprises.

13
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,880
- Hi, my name is Ashley.

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,973
I live on a farm outside of Charleston.

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,340
- My name's Derrick.

16
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,024
I'm 24 years old.

17
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,674
I'm competitive and I'm a winner.

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,060
- The name's Adam.

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,260
I am 20 years old.

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,563
I think I'd be good
for your survival show.

21
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,815
- And you know cast me in the show.

22
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:54,394
Maybe it'll raise your
production value a little bit.

23
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,343
- Hey there.

24
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,810
I'm Derrick.

25
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,320
- Ashley.

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,930
- I'm guessing you're here for the show.

27
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,325
- Yeah.

28
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,500
It's where the e-mail I got said to be.

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,333
- Same here.

30
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,093
- Hey guys.

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,300
I'm Taylor.

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,850
- Adam.
- Ashley.

33
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,683
- Derrick.

34
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,030
- Is this it?

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,040
- The e-mail I got said

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,846
that we should all be

37
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:57,519
- Whoo!

38
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:00,990
Let's get this party started.

39
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,530
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Shawn.

40
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,363
I'm the winner.

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,580
Hey, Shawn, I'm the winner.

42
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,610
- Cocky much?

43
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,380
- I'm just stating the facts, baby girl.

44
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,030
- Okay, on that note,

45
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,740
you guys all got the same e-mail, right?

46
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,870
- Blah, blah, blah,
grand prize of $50,000.

47
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,713
- Wait a minute, is that an iPod?

48
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,783
- Yeah.

49
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,193
- Why do you have an iPod?

50
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,173
- Well they said

51
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,030
that we could each bring
one item of our own.

52
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,980
- And you decided to bring an iPod?

53
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,280
- You do know those
things need charge, right?

54
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,173
- And what did you bring, your pom poms?

55
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,113
- What?

56
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:42,890
This complexion doesn't come naturally.

57
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,820
- I don't think you're gonna need

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,007
any help with that out here.

59
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,870
- But if you need any help
applying it, I got your back.

60
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,503
- Well, I brought this.

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,250
My fiance gave it to me
on our second anniversary.

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,390
It was a really, really nice--

63
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,990
- Did any of you guys bring
anything that's actually useful?

64
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,990
- Since you're the expert,

65
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,023
why don't you educate us, survivor man!

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,470
- Bug spray?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,050
Have any of you guys actually
ever seen one of these shows?

68
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,100
All the contestants are
covered from head to toe

69
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,690
in mosquito bites by the
end of the first night.

70
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,390
- Did you bring a night light too?

71
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,440
- Well what'd you bring?

72
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,273
Muscle milk?

73
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,340
- I got everything I need right here.

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,223
- Welcome to reality TV.

75
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,333
- Hey guys.

76
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:54,700
- Are you here for us?

77
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,637
- Throw a line, tie her up.

78
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,570
- Are you sure this thing is safe?

79
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:14,353
- Tell me this thing is just for the show.

80
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:42,963
So where are you taking us?

81
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,040
- Is it just me or does it feel like

82
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,823
these trees are watching us?

83
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,910
- I'm a little more worried
about this floating death trap.

84
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,703
- Wouldn't wanna get that iPod wet.

85
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,150
- Honestly I think I'd rather be swimming.

86
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,870
- In that case, I'll
just throw you overboard.

87
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,703
- Stop it.

88
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:29,100
- Guys, be careful with
any sudden movement.

89
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,583
This thing may capsize.

90
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,420
- They say war flanked these hills

91
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,563
years before the white man settled.

92
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,160
Tribes butchered tribes for nothing more

93
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,603
than land and crops.

94
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,810
Blood seeped through the ground

95
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,533
and cried out for retribution.

96
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,920
What crawled out of the womb of the Earth

97
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,273
was a force neither man
nor God could shackle.

98
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,200
When settlers finally came

99
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,763
their eyes played witness
to unimaginable horrors.

100
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,610
What was one a place of life

101
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,133
was now a gallery of death.

102
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,190
Bodies littered the
earth, consumed the trees,

103
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,530
yet the forest seems as
if it feeds day and night

104
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,113
on the souls of men.

105
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,333
Its hunger for flesh remains unsatisfied.

106
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,113
Its thirst for blood remains unquenched.

107
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,677
Beware all mortal souls
who enter these woods.

108
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,700
None shall return.

109
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,350
- Bravo, bravo!

110
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,140
Now that, ladies and gents
is quality entertainment.

111
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,320
Coulda gone with a few more
fireworks and explosions

112
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,392
but overall not too bad.

113
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:52,700
- At least he looks the part.

114
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,220
- And he sure is cotton
pickin' good at it.

115
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,000
- Hey now.
- Guys, it's usually

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,230
not a good idea to make
fun of a man with a gun.

117
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,690
- Come on, it's not real.

118
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,893
All show it is.

119
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,620
It's just in case the Union soldiers

120
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,690
happen to come marching
through these here parts.

121
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,920
- Hey, you mind if I borrow some chew?

122
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,260
I hear cancer's making a comeback.

123
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,170
- Oh that's so disgusting.

124
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,003
- What?

125
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,060
You mean to tell me you don't
wanna play tonsil hockey

126
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,380
with Jed Clampett over there?

127
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,963
- That's it, I resign.

128
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,720
Dry land.

129
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,010
Thank God, I never thought being stranded

130
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,440
would look so good.

131
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,170
- Wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.

132
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,300
- Where is everyone?

133
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,560
- Yeah, shouldn't there be
some kinda host or camera crew?

134
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,193
- Hey, is this it?

135
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,053
- Is it really just us?

136
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:51,770
It's a Sony Handycam.

137
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,970
- Are you serious?

138
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,140
What year did they steal that thing from?

139
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,700
Jesus, it still
uses mini DV tapes.

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,870
Mini what?

141
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,940
- Guys, am I the only one
concerned that nobody is out here?

142
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,880
- You guys are so naive.

143
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,000
They probably have this whole
forest rigged with cameras.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,270
They've probably been
watching this whole time.

145
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,110
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

146
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,110
And this, thank you,
is for our POV footage.

147
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,257
You know for our diary shots and stuff.

148
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,490
- All right, let's say you're right.

149
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,200
So what do we do now?

150
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,980
- How about we just walk into the woods

151
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,200
until we find a good spot?

152
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,310
- Wait a minute, I think we gotta be

153
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,240
a little bit more strategic than that.

154
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,810
- You got a map there, Marco Polo?

155
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,130
- No, but I got a little
bit of common sense.

156
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,670
- Why don't we just follow the river

157
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,970
and maybe it'll lead to
a large source of water.

158
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,860
- You know what, how about
we just follow the river.

159
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,260
I'm sure it'll lead to a
larger source of water.

160
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,013
- Let the journey begin.

161
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,393
Journey begins.

162
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,959
So ladies, why don't
you tell us about yourselves.

163
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,580
- What would you like to know?

164
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,430
What do you like to do for fun?

165
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,135
- The usual.

166
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:07,750
Sleepovers, pillow
fights in our underwear.

167
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,260
Mm, what do you say, Ashley?

168
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,390
Is that accurate?

169
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,660
- I prefer horseback riding,
going to the theater,

170
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,950
hanging out with my fiance, Brad.

171
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,010
So you like movies?

172
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,400
- No, like musical theater.

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,520
You know plays?

174
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah, that's boring.

175
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,680
Well as you ladies know,
the 50,000 big ones

176
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,120
will only be awarded to
the last man standing.

177
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,600
Of course man standing, obviously.

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,890
And since there's no question
that I'll go the distance,

179
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,580
which many females can attest to,

180
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,670
my question is this, who do you think

181
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,120
will be the first person
to leave the island?

182
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
- I'd say Adam.

183
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,790
Interesting.

184
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,630
Why Adam?

185
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,080
- I know his type.

186
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,670
Unless he can turn that hoodie of his

187
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,870
into a fully functional RV,

188
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,660
I don't think he'll stand a chance.

189
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,787
Oh I like that.

190
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,655
It would appear the kitten has claws.

191
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,610
- So who do you think
will be the first to go?

192
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,090
My money's on
Lieutenant Dan back there.

193
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,901
Hey Lieutenant Dan, you
want some ice cream?

194
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,910
Not one of us girls?

195
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,860
Oh don't get me wrong, ladies.

196
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm going to win.

197
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,580
But if I had to choose,
I'd rather get stuck

198
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,100
out here with you two.

199
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,820
Who knows what might happen.

200
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,461
- Dreaming, lover boy.

201
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,498
- Who knows what may happen.

202
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,165
- Oh, what the hell?

203
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:24,679
What is that?

204
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,480
- That's so gross.

205
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,140
- Anybody have any idea
what type of animal this is?

206
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,990
Or was.

207
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,070
Could be a wild boar.

208
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,450
- It was a snare.

209
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,930
- A what?

210
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,550
- Hunters used 'em to catch animals.

211
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,000
My guess, poor guy tried to get loose.

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,660
And something came along
before the hunter could.

213
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,049
- Who would be hunting out here?

214
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:50,610
- It doesn't look that fresh,
so it's probably been a while.

215
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,180
- Thanks for the science lesson, Bill Nye.

216
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,013
I'm gonna go.

217
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,760
- Hey, do you need us to stop
and take a break for a second?

218
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,630
- Why would you ask that?

219
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,730
- I just noticed you were
having a hard time keeping up.

220
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,563
- I'm fine.

221
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,340
Look at me, I'm doing my part.

222
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,173
No, now I'm itching.

223
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:33,006
Ow, ow.

224
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:34,400
Yeah, get that fly.

225
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,880
That's what I do.

226
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,713
Pick up sticks.

227
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:37,580
Oh look, another stick.

228
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,880
How 'bout that.

229
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,033
Hmm, okay no.

230
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,860
You don't understand
it's more than a choice.

231
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,290
It's a lifestyle.

232
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,320
I'm just too close-minded
to understand though.

233
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,550
Being a furry isn't just about sex.

234
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,890
Well, it is for me though.

235
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,723
I'm bored.

236
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,640
Oh yeah, yeah put on some lotion.

237
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,980
Yeah, just spray though.

238
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,300
Just rub, oh right there,

239
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
yes down the thigh.

240
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,040
And lay back, lay back.

241
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,620
Yeah oh nice, nice
rotation towards camera.

242
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,150
Oh I love it.

243
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,983
I love it.

244
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,360
Oh just bask in all your glory.

245
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,493
Oh my god.

246
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:19,643
Man, can I get a hand?

247
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,743
- I was just thinking the same thing.

248
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,483
I would, but you seem
to be doing a great job.

249
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,470
Wouldn't wanna steal all your glory.

250
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,243
Harry Potter.

251
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,460
Keep an eye on this for me.

252
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,840
- I really hope if you have a girlfriend

253
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,200
that you actually treat
her with more respect.

254
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,920
You know or boyfriend, or whatever.

255
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,127
- You think I'm gay?

256
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,110
- No, I just didn't wanna
jump to any conclusions.

257
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,080
I'm not judging you or anything.

258
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,180
I just, there's this guy
in my women's studies class

259
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,013
and he was so--

260
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:13,540
- I'm just messing with you.

261
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,433
And I don't have a girlfriend.

262
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,510
If you haven't noticed

263
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,663
I don't exactly have the
most inviting personality.

264
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,170
- Well that's not true.

265
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,800
- Seriously?

266
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,830
- I mean yeah, just 'cause
you're not an uber extrovert

267
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,150
doesn't mean you're not
worth getting to know.

268
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,370
- Try telling that to the other

269
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,570
eight and a half million
people in New York.

270
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,573
- Come on, I'm sure you
have somebody back home.

271
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,950
- Actually I just got out

272
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,353
of being in a pretty serious relationship.

273
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,760
- What was their name?

274
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,293
- Her name was Brittney.

275
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,500
She had this knack for making me feel like

276
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,050
I could actually accomplish
something with my life.

277
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,285
But in the end I guess you could say

278
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,773
we had a difference in opinion.

279
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,453
- What about?

280
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,453
- I saw us being exclusive and she didn't.

281
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,650
- I'm sorry.

282
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,600
You're probably better off without her.

283
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,360
- What about you?

284
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,303
How did you meet your wonderful boyfriend?

285
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,073
- Fiance.

286
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,530
Brad and I actually grew up together.

287
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,080
But it wasn't until I went away to college

288
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,230
that he finally mustered up
the courage to ask me out.

289
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,230
I turned him down at first.

290
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,460
You know, 'cause a long
distance relationship.

291
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,650
Not really a good idea.

292
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,040
But every time I came home from school,

293
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,400
every time, he brought me a dozen roses

294
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,500
and asked me to dinner, like without fail.

295
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,960
After a year and a
half, I finally said yes

296
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,603
and I don't know, I've never
regretted it, ever since.

297
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,193
- Wow.

298
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,333
That's a nice story.

299
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,130
You should sell the rights
to the Hallmark Channel.

300
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,430
- I know it sounds cheesy.

301
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,450
But it's our story.

302
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,570
- I don't mind the pain of the betrayal.

303
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,140
Helps make me a better artist.

304
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,473
- Well everyone's got their own rosebud.

305
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,583
- Yeah.

306
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:34,078
- You know, it's much nicer in here.

307
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,880
- Is that a fact?

308
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,730
- How about you come in and find out?

309
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,150
- Really?

310
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,500
- Promise to keep you safe.

311
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,213
Oh my god it's cold in here.

312
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,153
And that's for getting me wet.

313
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,615
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?

314
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,700
- I've done this a couple times.

315
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,510
- My father taught me
how to fend for myself

316
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,950
growing up on the farm.

317
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,923
Did your father teach you to do this?

318
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:19,303
- I don't have a father.

319
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,240
- Oh.

320
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,170
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

321
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,020
- What about you?

322
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,633
What are you doing here?

323
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,100
- What do you mean?

324
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,600
- You seem like you
got a pretty good life.

325
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Good head on your shoulders.

326
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,323
So, why do you want to be on reality TV?

327
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,660
- I guess I could say
the same thing to you.

328
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,593
You did it!

329
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,823
Yes!

330
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,030
What do we have here?

331
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,390
- It's day one in the
wilderness and Derrick here

332
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,340
has created fire out
of practically nothing.

333
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,950
- It's beautiful out here.

334
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,053
- Yes, it is.

335
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,820
- Do you think they're watching us?

336
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,350
What was that?

337
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,310
- It was probably an animal or something.

338
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,550
It's the woods.

339
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,750
- We haven't seen a single
animal since we got here.

340
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,060
- So what?

341
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,330
You think a curse haunts them there hills?

342
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,973
- No, kind of creepy though.

343
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:49,445
What?

344
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:52,935
Shawn?

345
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:54,746
Shawn!

346
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:55,579
Shawn.

347
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,870
You're an asshole!

348
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,230
- It was a joke.

349
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,140
- It wasn't funny.

350
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,350
I really thought that you--

351
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,233
- The Loch Ness monster got us?

352
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,273
- You're such a dick!

353
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,080
- Do you think it's edible?

354
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,963
- Oh it's edible.

355
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,310
Question is will you eat it?

356
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,483
- Oh well I was hungry.

357
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,253
- Hmm, it's a bit chewy.

358
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,303
Not that bad.

359
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,470
- Ugh, I'm gonna be sick.

360
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,760
- Are you sure you guys don't want any?

361
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,170
I'm sure there's more around.

362
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,670
- He's got the right idea though.

363
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,620
We do need to start thinking about food.

364
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,570
And bugs are a great source of protein.

365
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,900
- If that's our only option,

366
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,270
I definitely just became a vegetarian.

367
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,460
- All right, you say that now,

368
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,390
give it two days.

369
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,970
I bet that grub over there
start looking like Big Mac.

370
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,830
- No way.

371
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,140
- The good news is I bet
there are plenty of fish,

372
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,193
frogs and small animals we can eat.

373
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,470
If we set traps maybe we
can catch bigger game.

374
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,600
Whoever set that snare back there

375
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,950
obviously had some success.

376
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,003
- Could we possible carve some spears?

377
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,190
- I really don't know how I feel

378
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,900
about sharp objects around this group.

379
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,460
- At least we have a fire.

380
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,530
And that's one of the
biggest hurdles out here.

381
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,190
- Thanks to you.

382
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,660
- What if it rains?

383
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,950
- That would be good.

384
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,860
That way we don't have to worry

385
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,771
about filtering our drinking water.

386
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,806
- What was that?

387
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,560
- What happened?

388
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,610
- Take a look, Rambo.

389
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:13,911
- What the hell is that?

390
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,650
Better question is

391
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,674
what would do a thing like that?

392
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:21,163
It was probably
a wolf or something.

393
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,720
- You know last I checked

394
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,013
wolves don't drag their prey up a tree.

395
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,630
- What do you think we
should do, detective?

396
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,780
Interrogate the victim?

397
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:31,809
- We need to stick together.

398
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,130
There are animals out here
that know this terrain

399
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,330
a lot better than we do.

400
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:38,130
And the last thing I want
is any of us getting hurt.

401
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,610
- Thanks Dad.

402
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,853
But I think I'll manage.

403
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,513
I mean, after all, it is
every man for himself.

404
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,910
- It's chilly out here.

405
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,683
Thank God we have a fire.

406
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,100
- After what we saw today

407
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,280
I'm just glad we're not in the dark.

408
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,977
- What are you so scared of?

409
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:42,190
You know most animals
are more afraid of us

410
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,190
than we are of them.

411
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,670
- Let's just hope
whatever it was, it's full

412
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,900
and far away from any of us.

413
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,870
- Don't worry, if it shows up again

414
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,447
I'll turn it inside out
and make a rug out of it.

415
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:56,050
- Guys, you know what, I really
hate to be a buzz kill here,

416
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,263
but don't forget, this is a game.

417
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:01,750
- What do you mean?

418
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,880
- My point is, eventually
there won't be no more

419
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,593
of this buddy buddy stuff.

420
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,670
I wish it wasn't the case,

421
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,090
but some of us are gonna be going home.

422
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,740
It's a competition with
50 grand on the line here.

423
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,310
- So what you're saying is that eventually

424
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,180
we all have to stab
each other in the back?

425
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,540
- I'm not saying that.

426
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,073
But like it or not
there's gonna come a time

427
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:25,510
when we gotta fend for ourselves

428
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,113
and forget about everybody else.

429
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,000
- There's nothing wrong
with sticking together.

430
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,360
If somebody wants to
leave then they can leave.

431
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,340
- I'm trying to be realistic here.

432
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,690
At the end of the day there
can only be one winner.

433
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,223
- If we're being realistic.

434
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,050
I think we all know
who that's going to be.

435
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,990
- I'm not trying to start an argument.

436
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,823
All I'm saying is--

437
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:48,890
- What Derrick is trying to say

438
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,030
is that while it's convenient
to stick with the group now,

439
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,283
when push comes to shove, he'll
do anything for the money.

440
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,665
Am I wrong?

441
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,453
Why don't you tell us what
you need it for so badly?

442
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,750
- Well I know what I plan
on using the money for.

443
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,793
As you guys know I'm
due to get married soon.

444
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,220
I was planning on using
the money to help pay

445
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,530
for the wedding and honeymoon.

446
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,290
- Where are you planning on going?

447
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,930
- Well we had a couple places in mind,

448
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,980
but I really wanna take this train

449
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,050
through the mountains in Canada.

450
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,240
And stop at all these sweet
little towns along the way.

451
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,060
- Sounds like a blast.

452
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,893
I thought you said

453
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:39,300
your parents are paying for your wedding.

454
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,683
- They are, but Brad and
I wanted to help out.

455
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,810
- Doesn't Mr. Perfect have a day job?

456
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,340
- Well yeah, but he's
already done so much for me.

457
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,600
I just...

458
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,083
- Well I'm just going to get a boob job.

459
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
- No shit?

460
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,370
- My plan is for the show
to be a stepping stone

461
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,220
for something greater.

462
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,910
I know it might seem shallow,

463
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,230
but I really wanna be famous.

464
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,743
- So your goal is to be a reality star?

465
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,760
- What and you're going to
cure cancer with 50 grand?

466
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,150
- Damn.

467
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,807
Now I'm thinking about
throwing in the towel.

468
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,570
What kinda after market
parts are we talking here?

469
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,350
C, D?

470
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,183
- I was thinking--

471
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,050
- I think you look just
fine just the way you are.

472
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,690
- No it's fine, I know it's superficial,

473
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,190
but I really don't mind talking about it.

474
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,560
- Why would you put
yourself through all that

475
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,160
for a bunch of guys who
aren't worth your time?

476
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,820
- Dammit woman, you're
killing my boner over here.

477
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,080
- Look, there's a difference between

478
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,650
being beautiful and being remembered.

479
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,670
Beauty is for pageants and princesses.

480
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,363
But the rest of us, we have
to claw our way to the top.

481
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,230
- I just think you should
do what makes you happy

482
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,660
and not what makes everybody else happy.

483
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,910
- I'll sign the petition.

484
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,940
You with me Derrick?

485
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,790
- It's your body.

486
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,960
I'd say just be sure
that's what you wanna do

487
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,410
before you go under knife.

488
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,130
- Oh gees, you sound just like my parents.

489
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,420
- You've actually talked
to your parents about this?

490
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,603
- Well when this airs I won't have to.

491
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,250
- So Adam, you said you're an artist.

492
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,700
But you never said what kind.

493
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,120
- I'm in this band.

494
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,630
We play a lotta local gigs.

495
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,230
But we haven't really taken off.

496
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:39,123
- What are you gonna do
with the money if you win?

497
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,313
- I'd like to find some dedicated members,

498
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,893
spruce up our gear and hopefully
record a kick ass demo.

499
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,543
- That's actually really cool.

500
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,560
What kinda music is it?

501
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,550
- It's kinda like, melodic hard core

502
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,623
meets Viking death metal.

503
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,493
With a touch of folk
and classical mixed in.

504
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:10,930
- Well that's nice.

505
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,573
Brad plays a little bit on the guitar.

506
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:13,573
- Oh my god.

507
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:15,848
- What?

508
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,220
- So what's the name of your band?

509
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,070
- I've been toying with
a few different names.

510
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,460
- Well what do you got?

511
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,770
- Nothing that great.

512
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,650
- Come on, let us be the judge of that.

513
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,483
- Yeah come on.

514
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:29,316
- Let's hear it.

515
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,053
- We were thinking Bloody Skyscrapers.

516
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,263
Or Bumper Planes.

517
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,973
The Fold-up Chairs.

518
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,028
Or The Liquid Shitters.

519
00:28:51,034 --> 00:28:52,343
What?

520
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:54,200
- No, those, those are great man.

521
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,240
Just make sure you save
us a seat at the Grammys.

522
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,390
- Hey, we can't fault
you on the originality.

523
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,030
- Whatever.

524
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,750
It's not like it matters.

525
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,300
- Hey, don't give up hope.

526
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,230
Even a blind squirrel gets
a nut every once in a while.

527
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,370
- Speaking from experience?

528
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,263
- More than Brad.

529
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,520
- So what are your big plans?

530
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,170
I mean you are the winner, right?

531
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,313
- Isn't it obvious?

532
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,410
Take my winnings, move to New York or LA.

533
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,860
Jumpstart my modeling career.

534
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,350
- No surprises there.

535
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,583
- Come on, body like this.

536
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,700
Be a crime not to show it to the world.

537
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,050
- I'm sure you'll fit right in.

538
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,630
- I always do.

539
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,430
- I'll give you the 50k
if you can go five minutes

540
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,430
without making another sexual reference.

541
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,133
- So?

542
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,703
Last but not least.

543
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,087
What about you?

544
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:51,090
- Oh you know, I'll buy myself a new ride.

545
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,690
- Please, do you think we're stupid?

546
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,020
- Come on dude.

547
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,660
We may all want this money,

548
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,290
but you, you need it.

549
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,001
The question is why?

550
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,360
- It's not important.

551
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,913
- Well if it's not important,
what's the big deal?

552
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,620
- It's personal.

553
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,220
- More personal than a boob job?

554
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,687
- I played football in high school.

555
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,003
My auntie, she really pushed me hard.

556
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,033
Wanted me to actually go places.

557
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,543
When I graduated

558
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,680
I landed a couple of
different scholarships.

559
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,463
I was even given a full ride
as long as I kept my grades up.

560
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,050
They always say you
should have a backup plan.

561
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,100
So I went for communications.

562
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,663
Played ball for two years.

563
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:52,093
Everything was going great.

564
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:56,791
Until this one game,

565
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,310
it was close to the end of the season.

566
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,363
Playoffs on the line.

567
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,240
I was running this hitch route.

568
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,560
Defensive end came around the corner

569
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,030
with a little bit too much momentum.

570
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,000
Cut me off at my knee.

571
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,883
Jacked up my ACL in my left leg.

572
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,250
Doctors did everything they could I guess.

573
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,253
I had a lotta complications.

574
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,230
But I was determined.

575
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:35,320
I was gonna work hard and go to rehab

576
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,033
every single day.

577
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,453
But in the end it just wasn't enough.

578
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,663
They took away my scholarship.

579
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,440
And before I knew it, I
was $30,000 in the hole

580
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,333
with a semester left and no prospects.

581
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,160
So that's why I'm here.

582
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,567
I'ma get outta debt, I'ma finish school

583
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,080
and I'ma get my life back on track.

584
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,580
- I'm sorry that happened to you.

585
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,493
- It is what it is.

586
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,573
- So what are you gonna do if you lose?

587
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,510
- I don't allow myself to
consider failure as an option.

588
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:42,164
What the fuck is that?

589
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:46,355
- I think Brad's balls just dropped.

590
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,100
- Maybe one of us should stay up?

591
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,830
Who wants first watch?

592
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:57,270
Guys!

593
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,293
Morning.

594
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,070
- Have you seen Adam?

595
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,570
- It's too early to be up.

596
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,240
Did you hear
anything weird last night?

597
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,890
- Other than The Liquid Shitters?

598
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,183
- Adam's gone.

599
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,740
- Maybe Rainman went into the woods.

600
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,670
Had to take a piss or something.

601
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,780
- What's going on?

602
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,150
- So nobody's seen Adam?

603
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,700
- Who cares.

604
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,820
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

605
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,180
He most likely woke up and
decided to take a walk.

606
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,120
- She's right.

607
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,190
There's nothing wrong.

608
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,090
I'm sure he just went off
to have some alone time.

609
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,510
It's day two out here in the wilderness.

610
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,260
And I've decided to take some time

611
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,080
out of my busy schedule

612
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,910
to demonstrate survival tactic number one.

613
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,390
Create a deadly weapon
with your bare hands.

614
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,540
Now I know what you're thinking

615
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,610
and yes, may bare hands
are deadly weapons.

616
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,060
But for those less fortunate,

617
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,250
search your surroundings
for a suitable object

618
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,720
capable of mass destruction.

619
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,063
My weapon of choice?

620
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,780
This stick, which with a little work

621
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,151
could be the difference
between winning and...

622
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:43,320
What was that word again?

623
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,690
I'm having a hard time remembering.

624
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,010
- Hey.

625
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,843
I hate to break it to you

626
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,950
but unless you're hunting caterpillars,

627
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,670
that thing isn't big
enough to do you any good.

628
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,917
- I wouldn't just to
conclusions if I were you.

629
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:56,793
- You need something much bigger.

630
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,253
- I'm impressed.

631
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:13,650
You really don't seem to be
afraid to get your hands dirty.

632
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,040
- Well I didn't have much of
a choice growing up on a farm.

633
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,600
- Sorry, I just find
it hard to picture you

634
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,190
as a farm hand.

635
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,120
- Why do you say that?

636
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,950
- You seem too dainty.

637
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,150
- Please, when was the last
time you touched a shovel?

638
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,400
- I used to do landscaping.

639
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,170
So I've had my share of splinters.

640
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,290
- I have a hard time picturing
you performing manual labor.

641
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,440
- Yeah well I didn't
have much of a choice.

642
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,100
- Sorry, I didn't realize--

643
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
- No, it's fine.

644
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,253
I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks.

645
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,650
My mom left before my sixth birthday

646
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,253
and my dad started drinking.

647
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,810
As a kid I used to walk
up to the pawn shop

648
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,563
and steal DVDs outta the cases.

649
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,433
And one day I got caught.

650
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,180
My dad had to pay the store
back for everything I stole.

651
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,683
So did I.

652
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,963
But you know I deserved it.

653
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,853
- So, modeling.

654
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,143
- Actually I,

655
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,780
I kinda wanna be an actor.

656
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,060
- Really?

657
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,210
- Yeah.

658
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,860
Not a lotta people make it
out from where I'm from.

659
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,453
I mean hey, if you shoot for the stars,

660
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,800
even if you don't make it

661
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,653
at least you won't be where you are now.

662
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,230
- Well I'm impressed.

663
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,493
- Well maybe you shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.

664
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,791
Even when that cover's so
hard to look away from.

665
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,140
- Still no sign of him, huh?

666
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,250
- Not yet.

667
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,140
- So strange.

668
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,450
It's been several hours now.

669
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,630
I don't know where he could be.

670
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,833
- Maybe he gave up.

671
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,413
- Hey, you mind giving
me a hand with these?

672
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,460
- I guess.

673
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,180
What do you want me to do?

674
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,950
- Until we find a source of protein,

675
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,430
this is gonna be our
best best for sustenance.

676
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,890
We just have to separate the
good ones from the bad ones.

677
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,820
- What's the difference?

678
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,930
- It's not that difficult.

679
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,360
You see these?

680
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,280
These are extremely poisonous.

681
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,115
- Well then why would you pick them?

682
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:41,980
- Because I wanted you guys to know

683
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,670
which ones to stay away from.

684
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,040
- So are any of them edible?

685
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,290
- Yeah.

686
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,820
Look, these are okay to eat.

687
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,300
You see how they look like tiny clusters

688
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,573
of even smaller berries?

689
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,890
You want some, don't you?

690
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,080
- What happened to fending for ourselves?

691
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,113
- Well, maybe I couldn't
resist those puppy dog eyes.

692
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,220
- What are you guys munching on over here?

693
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,720
- Berries.

694
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,360
- Are there any left?

695
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,193
- Yeah.

696
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:24,310
Come on, help yourself.

697
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,060
- I'm not sure I trust
your berry picking skills.

698
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,013
- Your loss.

699
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,450
- Guys, I'm really starting
to worry about Adam.

700
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,670
- Yeah, it's been way too long.

701
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,963
- One down, three to go.

702
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,520
- Really?

703
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,640
You're gonna do that now?

704
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,940
- It's really past the
point of joking around.

705
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:48,380
- Only the strong survive.

706
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,990
- All right, you know what, that's it.

707
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,470
We're gonna go looking for him.

708
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,820
Now.
- Mm hmm, definitely.

709
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,883
- Seriously?

710
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,330
You guys are gonna follow Mr. Clean?

711
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,883
Okay yeah, all right, I'm coming.

712
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:15,733
And this is what happens
when furries go missing.

713
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,030
Hang onto your pets, folks,

714
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,333
because if they run away you
should just let 'em run away.

715
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,760
Well we're in a forest,
what do you expect?

716
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,683
This is what we signed up for.

717
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:33,023
And there's the winning ticket.

718
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,320
Wow.

719
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,263
Ladies and gentlemen, you
cannot get enough of that.

720
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,437
Adam!

721
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,740
I hope he's all right.

722
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,710
I really don't
see what the big deal is.

723
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,710
- What if he's hurt?

724
00:41:51,693 --> 00:41:53,460
I'm telling you,
this is a waste of time.

725
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,840
- No, Ashley's right.

726
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,720
We've seen some really
weird shit out here.

727
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,430
Starting to believe that old man.

728
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,490
- What do you mean?

729
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,650
On the boat.

730
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,793
The old perv was going on
about some legend out here.

731
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,190
- This is getting outta control.

732
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,140
What if he just gave up?

733
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,340
We all knew it was gonna
happen at some point.

734
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,233
- Yeah, but where'd he go?

735
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:16,520
It's not like he can just walk home.

736
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,783
- You guys can go back.

737
00:42:17,783 --> 00:42:18,730
I'ma keep looking.

738
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,190
- I thought you were the one that said

739
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,790
we needed to stick together.

740
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,623
- This is a waste of time.

741
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,689
I'm headed back.

742
00:42:23,689 --> 00:42:24,663
- Shh.

743
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:28,575
- What?

744
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:29,673
♪ Imagination in mind ♪

745
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,506
- You hear that?

746
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,580
- I don't hear any--

747
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,663
- Shut it up.

748
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:36,812
♪ You can spend your life ♪

749
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:38,658
What is that?

750
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:40,053
- It sounds like music.

751
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,940
- Where's it coming from?

752
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,483
- Sounds like over there.

753
00:42:49,855 --> 00:42:52,185
- No.

754
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,070
We need to call for help.

755
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,610
- Everybody calm down.

756
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,375
We don't know what happened here.

757
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,208
- What, are you blind?

758
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,870
Something serious has happened.

759
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,900
- How do you know,
because we found his iPod

760
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,733
with some blood on it?

761
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:08,420
I'm sure it's not even real blood.

762
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,290
- Gosh you can't be this stupid.

763
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,123
Fake blood?

764
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,490
You think that's fake blood?

765
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,370
- Haven't you seen those
Scared Straight shows?

766
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,380
That's all this is.

767
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,500
They want you to think it's
real, but it's all fake.

768
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,090
I mean let's look at the facts.

769
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,780
Adam goes missing during the night

770
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,000
while we're all asleep.

771
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,610
Nobody knows what happened to him

772
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,960
and the next day we find his iPod.

773
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,793
That's it.

774
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:31,650
I've said it a thousand times.

775
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,350
It's all a part of the show.

776
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,990
- I don't see how making
us think he's dead

777
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,690
is a part of the show.

778
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,140
- I'm telling you, we're being pranked.

779
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,973
That's all.

780
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,950
- Or somebody's trying to cover it up.

781
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:42,980
- What?

782
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,010
- The way I see it, there's
been one person stalling us

783
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,843
this entire time.

784
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:48,630
- What are you trying to say?

785
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,180
- Adam's been gone all day.

786
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,480
Everybody else here is
concerned except you.

787
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,090
And you keep bringing this stupid camera.

788
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,250
- You think I had something to do with it?

789
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,200
- I'm not ruling it out.

790
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,370
- You outta your fucking mind?

791
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,160
- I don't know, you tell me.

792
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,340
- If anybody has something
to gain, it's you.

793
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,840
We all heard your sob story last night.

794
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,430
Maybe you couldn't wait any longer

795
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,480
so you decided to balance
the odds in your favor.

796
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,685
- Now what you talking 'bout?

797
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:12,240
- Couldn't handle the competition.

798
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,600
So you decided to start
picking us off one by one.

799
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,433
Am I right?

800
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:16,266
- No, stop it.

801
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:19,070
- You seem a little upset
for someone who's innocent.

802
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,953
- You see any blood on my hands?

803
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:21,150
- You see any on mine?

804
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,070
- It doesn't matter, okay?

805
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,660
We just need to keep looking.

806
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:26,422
- You know what?

807
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:27,255
You're right.

808
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:29,990
You wanna play CSI?

809
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,430
I'm down.

810
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,090
But I vote we split up
to cover more ground.

811
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,410
- Are you sure that's a good idea?

812
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,680
- Fine.

813
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,160
We'll split up.

814
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,400
We'll circle the lake and
we'll meet back at the camp.

815
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
- Sounds good to me.

816
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,724
- I'll go with him.

817
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,557
- You be safe.

818
00:44:46,557 --> 00:44:47,750
We'll see you back at camp.

819
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,520
- What a fucking dick.

820
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,423
It's so painfully obvious
it's all part of the show.

821
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,517
He's gonna feel like a real
jackass when he finds out.

822
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,393
- Let's give them something to edit out.

823
00:45:34,544 --> 00:45:36,420
You know I had
nothing to do with this, right?

824
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,570
- Yeah, of course I do.

825
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,270
You think something bad really happened?

826
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,730
- Honestly I don't know.

827
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,640
If something bad did happen,

828
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,360
we need to be prepared.

829
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,460
Nobody gonna help us out here.

830
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,780
- Hey, why don't we stop for a minute?

831
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,613
- No, I'm good.

832
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:52,446
Let's keep going.

833
00:45:52,446 --> 00:45:53,483
- It's not a problem.

834
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,250
- I said I'm fine.

835
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,210
- Why do you get so hostile
when people try to help you?

836
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,960
- I keep telling you the
same thing, I'm okay.

837
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,793
- You're not okay.

838
00:46:00,793 --> 00:46:03,303
You've been grabbing your
knee ever since we got here.

839
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,310
What is it with you guys

840
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:09,085
every time a woman offers you
help you think you're weak?

841
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:11,013
Are you really that narrow minded?

842
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,140
Why did I come out here?

843
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:26,309
I mean look at me, I'm filthy,
I'm sweaty and for what?

844
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,373
50 grand?

845
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,020
I could be at home
right now riding horses.

846
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,623
But no, I just had to come out here.

847
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,293
- Look, I know you said why you're here.

848
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,053
But it's not just about
the money for you, is it?

849
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,980
- You wanna know what it is?

850
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,523
Pride.

851
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,280
Brad takes care of me.

852
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,223
He always has.

853
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,023
Anything I ever needed he would handle it.

854
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,790
That may sound nice, but after a while

855
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,540
you start to feel pretty worthless.

856
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,190
Like you can't even brush your teeth

857
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,740
without somebody there to help.

858
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,110
- So you're here to prove to yourself

859
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,260
that you can stand on your own two feet?

860
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,743
When I got hurt,

861
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:40,111
I had to go through
multiple knee surgeries.

862
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,300
I couldn't even walk.

863
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,803
My auntie, she had to
do everything for me.

864
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,833
She helped me get dressed,
get in and out of the car,

865
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,210
she even had to help me take a shower.

866
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,083
Man was I miserable.

867
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,453
So now, anytime somebody tries to help me,

868
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,253
it just takes me back to
that place and that time.

869
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,100
I couldn't do anything for myself.

870
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,070
So you not wanting to
rely on other people,

871
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,280
I can understand that.

872
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,613
Come on man.

873
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:29,313
Don't you go crying on me or nothing.

874
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,173
- You look relaxed.

875
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:39,579
- Eh.

876
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,260
- Where are you going?

877
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,670
- Gotta take a piss.

878
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,210
- Thanks for sharing.

879
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,327
- Thanks for asking.

880
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:04,986
Taylor!

881
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:14,642
Taylor hold on!

882
00:49:22,104 --> 00:49:22,937
Taylor!

883
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:01,280
There's no
way that that is true.

884
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,113
- I swear to you it is.

885
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:03,480
- Nope, there's no way they switched

886
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,230
your medical chart with another person.

887
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,067
- Yep.

888
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:07,470
Apparently it happens all the time.

889
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,303
- No way.

890
00:50:08,303 --> 00:50:09,136
- Can you believe that?

891
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:09,969
- No!

892
00:50:09,969 --> 00:50:10,985
That's like wrong.

893
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,260
Shawn.
- What the hell?

894
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,300
- We have to leave right now.

895
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,850
- Dude, where's Taylor?

896
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:16,910
- I don't know, it happened so fast

897
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:17,743
I didn't have time to do anything.

898
00:50:17,743 --> 00:50:19,173
- We can't help you until
you tell us what happened.

899
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:20,570
- We have to leave right now.

900
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,880
- Why?
- Where's Taylor?

901
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,713
- I don't know.

902
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:23,546
Something got her.

903
00:50:23,546 --> 00:50:25,660
I turned away for a second
and the next thing I knew

904
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,587
she was gone.

905
00:50:26,587 --> 00:50:27,420
- What do you mean something got her?

906
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,550
- What happened to your leg?

907
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,610
We have to go get help.

908
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,443
- Who's gonna help us?

909
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:33,100
- Well nobody if we stay here.

910
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,974
- So she just disappeared, huh?

911
00:50:34,974 --> 00:50:35,807
- Yeah, that's what I said.

912
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:36,880
- Just like Adam, right?

913
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,713
- Yeah, I guess.

914
00:50:37,713 --> 00:50:38,970
- Seems kinda odd, doesn't it?

915
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,410
- Really, you wanna do this again?

916
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,060
- You're the one standing
here with blood on your hands.

917
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,020
- Yeah, my own fucking blood.

918
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,870
- All of it?

919
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,773
- Hey fuck you.

920
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:45,606
This is bullshit.

921
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:47,030
- No one is accusing anybody here.

922
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,863
Okay?

923
00:50:47,863 --> 00:50:49,440
We just, we need to go
back to where you were

924
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,930
and see if we can find some answers.

925
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,353
Take us there, Shawn.

926
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,563
- It doesn't matter.

927
00:50:57,563 --> 00:50:59,280
I'm sure we're already dead anyway.

928
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:29,963
- Hey,

929
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,870
this place isn't safe anymore.

930
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:36,703
- Anymore?

931
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,890
- I think it might be a good
idea for you to head back.

932
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,620
- Where am I supposed to go?

933
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,950
- Just head back the way we came.

934
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,503
Try to get to the river
and flag somebody down.

935
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,030
- Seriously?

936
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,573
You think it would be safer
for me out there by myself?

937
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:07,479
Where'd you get that?

938
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:10,013
- I found it this morning while
I was out looking for food.

939
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:14,410
Look, I don't know what
we're about to walk into.

940
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,640
And I'm not so sure I can protect you

941
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,182
if something were to happen.

942
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:18,560
- I'll take my chances.

943
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,720
- I don't think you understand.

944
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,683
No one is coming to help us.

945
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,583
- How do you know that?

946
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,416
- I don't.

947
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,280
But based on everything that's happened,

948
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,080
I'm not counting on it.

949
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,750
- They wouldn't just
send us out here to die.

950
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,583
- We don't know that.

951
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:40,500
- And our families, they
have to know where we are.

952
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,333
Right?

953
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:46,960
- It's gonna be okay.

954
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,790
We're gonna make it outta here.

955
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,950
Somehow.

956
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,053
It's right over here.

957
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:58,903
- Remember,

958
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,893
if anything happens, you run.

959
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,083
- This is where it happened.

960
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,310
This isn't a fucking game anymore.

961
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:45,450
We need to make our way back to the river.

962
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,050
Hopefully we can find some help.

963
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,590
- Let's give them something to edit out.

964
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,141
- Where is she?
- What?

965
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:08,974
- What did you do?

966
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:09,807
- This isn't helping.

967
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:11,550
- You don't know what he is, what he did.

968
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,383
What'd I do?

969
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:13,359
Fuck off me.

970
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:30,320
What'd you do, Shawn?

971
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,153
- Guys.

972
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:36,402
Guys!

973
00:54:38,263 --> 00:54:40,596
There's something out there.

974
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:42,951
What?

975
00:54:52,195 --> 00:54:53,028
Come on.

976
00:56:30,362 --> 00:56:31,671
No Derrick!

977
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:33,171
No, Derrick, wait!

978
00:56:35,054 --> 00:56:36,419
Derrick wait.
- No no no, come on.

979
00:56:36,419 --> 00:56:41,419
Come on.

980
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:44,842
No, no!

981
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:50,887
No, no, no, no.

982
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,003
- Go.

983
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:13,363
Do you think someone's in there?

984
00:57:20,049 --> 00:57:21,882
- I don't see anybody.

985
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,190
- Wait.

986
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,517
Are you sure it's safe?

987
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:00,498
Shawn.

988
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:02,322
- What?

989
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:08,715
What is this?

990
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:11,410
I don't know.

991
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,651
- Hold on, you don't think this is--

992
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:13,484
- I don't know what it is.

993
00:58:13,484 --> 00:58:15,233
I just don't think we need to be in here.

994
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,734
- Is this some kinda cult shit?

995
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:29,305
None of this was ever a fucking game.

996
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,310
- What are those?

997
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,848
Oh my god.
- Oh my god.

998
00:59:08,848 --> 00:59:09,681
Wait.

999
00:59:24,248 --> 00:59:25,165
No!

1000
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:27,438
- Oh my god we're gonna die.

1001
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,113
We're gonna die.
- No, no, no, no.

1002
00:59:29,113 --> 00:59:30,170
No, no, no.

1003
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,740
We're gonna make our
way back to the river.

1004
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,650
We're gonna leave this place.

1005
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,993
We'll find out, okay?

1006
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:42,441
You can't just hide.

1007
00:59:42,441 --> 00:59:43,774
- Come on, okay?

1008
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:49,560
After I open the door, make
your way back to the river.

1009
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,440
No matter what don't look back.

1010
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,273
Okay?

1011
00:59:57,692 --> 00:59:59,241
- Shawn help me please, help me, help me.

1012
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:00,074
Ashley, Ashley!

1013
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:01,196
Ashley no!

1014
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:02,614
- Shawn please help me.

1015
01:00:02,614 --> 01:00:04,826
Shawn!

1016
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,863
- We quell the beast with this sacrifice.

1017
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,803
May the blood of these
lambs bring fulfillment.

1018
01:01:26,865 --> 01:01:27,698
- Ashley.

1019
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:29,873
Ashley wake up.

1020
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,570
Ashley.

1021
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,960
- Shawn?

1022
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,660
- Ashley, I'm right here.

1023
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,743
- Shawn what?

1024
01:01:42,743 --> 01:01:44,140
What happened?

1025
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,800
- I don't know.

1026
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,730
Try to get your hands free.

1027
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:47,843
- I can't, I can't.

1028
01:01:53,378 --> 01:01:55,555
Shawn you have to help me, please.

1029
01:01:55,555 --> 01:01:56,478
Please help me Shawn, please?

1030
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,750
I can't feel my fingers.

1031
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,827
Help me.

1032
01:02:19,827 --> 01:02:20,674
Please.

1033
01:02:20,674 --> 01:02:23,282
- Hey, hey, I got you, okay?

1034
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:24,524
- Okay.

1035
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:26,770
- Try to get the rope over.

1036
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:27,971
Help me please.

1037
01:02:27,971 --> 01:02:28,804
He's coming.

1038
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:30,045
He's coming Shawn, help me.

1039
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:30,920
- Hold tight.

1040
01:02:34,747 --> 01:02:36,309
- Please, please.

1041
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:39,105
I can't, I can't.
- All right, come on.

1042
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,737
- Don't please.
- Almost, almost, almost.

1043
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:41,570
- Shawn, he's coming.

1044
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:42,403
He's coming.

1045
01:02:43,918 --> 01:02:46,251
Ow!

1046
01:02:50,878 --> 01:02:51,969
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn.

1047
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:52,821
Please help me.

1048
01:02:52,821 --> 01:02:54,108
- I'm sorry, I really am.

1049
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:55,595
- No, I don't wanna die.

1050
01:02:55,595 --> 01:02:57,345
Shawn please, please.

1051
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:05,863
No, no, no, no!
