00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,157
THE BRAZILWOOD MAN

2
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,871
Did you like it?

3
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,391
Please, two by two.

4
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,280
Madame is tired, please.

5
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,076
We're theater critics.

6
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,715
We came to see the show
and to interview you.

7
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,350
But, after seeing you dance,
we are speechless.

8
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,713
How lucky that your wandering
genius brought you to Brazil.

9
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,238
It seems you were born dancing...

10
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,471
touching the five corners
of the world

11
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,035
with your scandalous personality.

12
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,916
Before my birth,

13
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,715
my mother was deeply depressed.

14
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,151
Her state was so tragic...

15
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,112
that she could only
eat oysters...

16
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,675
and drink iced champagne.

17
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,511
When asked when
I began to dance

18
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,357
I reply: In my mother's womb...

19
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,470
perhaps as a result of the oysters
and of the champagne...

20
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,230
...Aphrodite's food.

21
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,188
Thank you.

22
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,278
You were superb!

23
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,595
How nice of you to come.

24
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,388
Let's go!

25
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,997
My folks almost made me into...

26
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,077
a mystic Puritan...

27
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,873
prepared for heroism

28
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,033
and definitely removed...

29
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,231
...from any sensual expression.

30
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,674
When I started to dance,
as a child...

31
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,158
I was moved by an
interior urge...

32
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,555
...the joy that ran
through my nerves...

33
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,952
...was so strong...

34
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,318
...that the simple idea
of physical contact...

35
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,354
...even imaginary
made me shiver with ecstasy.

36
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,712
And I swooned...

37
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,918
...awaiting the sting,
both sweet...

38
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,472
...and painful of pleasure.

39
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,954
I wanted to scream.

40
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,430
As if all the fibers of my body...

41
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,598
...were waiting for...
the apex of love...

42
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,838
...which lasts but an instant.

43
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,350
As if all my nerves...

44
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,880
...vibrated so intensely...

45
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,398
...that I no longer knew if
I was enjoying an endless joy...

46
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,240
...or a pain without reprieve.

47
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,155
I felt these sensations...

48
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,670
...so languid and terrible...

49
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,870
it seemed pleasure would kill me.

50
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,718
And I swooned.

51
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,235
My soul was a battlefield...

52
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,798
over which Apollo and Dionysus...

53
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,311
Christ, Nietzsche...

54
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,755
and Richard Wagner

55
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,800
fought for my possession.

56
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,798
It's Dorotéia.

57
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,915
She lives with us.

58
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,391
She also dances.

59
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,998
How old is she?

60
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,551
Eighteen.

61
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,269
There are thousands like her.

62
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,391
Here, it was for you.

63
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,790
Her panties!

64
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,917
Give me a sniff?

65
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,760
What the hell is this?

66
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,195
What's that in your hand?

67
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,675
That's what I'd like to know!

68
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,715
If I'm not mistaken,
it's a pair of panties...

69
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,753
...medium size,
your size, actually.

70
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,349
It was next to the front door.

71
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,954
You've gone crazy!

72
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,515
Has someone bitten your ass?

73
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,756
One of your panties was
next to the front door...

74
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,872
...through which you should
have left a long time ago!

75
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,398
But, I don't use panties.

76
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,836
What's this panties story
that's driving Lala mad?

77
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,999
- She's imagining things...
- Don't hide it... Show me!

78
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,432
Has anyone seen the panties
I've just bought?

79
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,949
It was just a cloth
hanging outside...

80
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,718
Lala is dumb.

81
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,070
To work, Dorotéia.

82
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,392
Let's do number one.

83
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,839
Attention!

84
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,031
One, two, three and four...

85
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,474
It's the romanticized intellect...

86
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,638
...that chooses the poetic themes.

87
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,157
But the poem can be born
from an onion...

88
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,391
...or from a lost love.

89
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,951
It doesn't need night or darkness

90
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,950
nor solitude...
nor silent hours...

91
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,558
It can be inspired by a sunset...

92
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,797
...or by a smokestack.

93
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,958
By a woman's divine body...

94
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,797
...or by the polished hood
of a Cadillac.

95
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,079
Blaise Cendrars...

96
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,954
one of today's greatest poets...

97
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,037
...asks:

98
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,873
"The woman?

99
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,680
But what about irony?"

100
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,910
Haven't the modern poets picked...

101
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,872
Einstein's theories...

102
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,958
...sports, soccer,
the telegraph...

103
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,595
...politics...

104
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,873
and nightclubs...
as sources of lyrical impulses?

105
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,310
This noisy opera plays
on the stage of our century:

106
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,919
The man on the street.

107
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,471
Let's play it!

108
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,711
Congratulations.

109
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,275
Thank you. Thank you.

110
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,870
"...Provoked by a sunset..."

111
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,395
"...or by a smokestack..."

112
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,318
"...by a woman's divine body..."

113
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,715
"...or by the divine body of
a Cadillac."

114
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,831
Figures my friend, just figures.

115
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,312
"Everything is vital,
there are no poetic themes."

116
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,875
"The poem can be born from an onion...

117
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,758
...or from a lost love."

118
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,397
"Poet Guilherme de Almeida,
Still In Love With The Telephone"

119
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,071
"Luis Aranha Shocks Lover
With Electric Poem"

120
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,636
"Freedom of choice enriches
the modern poet."

121
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,918
"He can use everything:
Scientific discoveries..."

122
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,795
"The poet, no longer in
his ivory tower..."

123
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,390
...receives the telegram of
Intelligence in the tramway."

124
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,673
Anything eminently lyric.
Everything is pertinent!"

125
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,560
"On the stage of our century..."

126
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,758
"...we play this noisy opera..."

127
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,510
"that of the man on the street.
Let's play it!"

128
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,388
Publish it!

129
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,638
Take off your hat.

130
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,514
You take it off!

131
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,518
Let's stop daydreaming
And invest in ourselves!

132
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,517
We need basic orientation.

133
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,837
For instance: The question of
Impersonality in art.

134
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,029
We need to solve it.

135
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,118
We must clarify
some shocking stories...

136
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,437
...like the one between
Victor Hugo and Saint-Boeuf.

137
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,918
- If true, we must start from zero.
- I decided to study seriously.

138
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,599
Rehabilitate my ignorance.

139
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,439
Portuguese, arithmetic,
ballistics etc.

140
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,515
There's only one way
to boost my moral:

141
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,030
Cutting off this carrot
that God gave me!

142
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,468
I had a completely idiotic idea:

143
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
To bugger the poet Fontes!

144
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,757
We, his admirers,
went to see him yesterday.

145
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,596
He thinks that here,
there's no public opinion.

146
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,118
He says he's a victim
of intrigues and scandals.

147
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,630
I got a hard-on.

148
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,957
It's time to take an
ir-re-vo-cable decision!

149
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,794
To hell with Lala's jealousy...

150
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,674
...and the kid's eternal bronchitis...

151
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,073
It's time to jilt her!

152
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,669
But with style!

153
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,678
And Dorotéia?

154
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,151
A goddess who descended onto earth.

155
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,277
You should have seen her
<i>Dance of the Elephants</i>. Mimed.

156
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,478
A true genius!

157
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,112
The other day,
she showed me her tits.

158
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,594
And?

159
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,992
If there was a double
or triple force... multiple...

160
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,313
To touch all balls at once.

161
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,837
"Under the forceful penis
of Herr Eckstein..."

162
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,429
You waste too much light reading.

163
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,551
Do you want us to be ignorant?

164
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,548
Here, drink up.

165
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,756
It's a ginger and cinnamon punch.

166
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,837
What are you insinuating?

167
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,271
- And the day before yesterday?
- Three days ago...

168
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,960
"During Herr Eckstein's embraces,
she felt..."

169
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,149
"...the contact of his penis
on her body."

170
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,555
- What's that?
- Freud.

171
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,469
"This revolting perception
was repressed..."

172
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,711
"...and substituted in her memory..."

173
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,191
"...by the innocent sensation
of a pressure on her breasts."

174
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,437
"Dora then evoked the most
tender scene of her infancy..."

175
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,911
"...where she sucked
her nurse's breast..."

176
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,430
"...while pulling rhythmically..."

177
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,075
"...at her little brother's penis."

178
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,591
"Clearly, the primary erogenous object;
or the nipple..."

179
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,439
"...was substituted by..."

180
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,277
"...the sexual organ at hand:"

181
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,915
"Herr Eckstein's penis."

182
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,877
"We further observe
that this perverse fantasy..."

183
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,755
"...of penis sucking..."

184
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,272
"...has an innocent origin..."

185
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,109
"...as a remote memory
of the mother's or nurse's breast."

186
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,474
"In other cases,
the teats of certain cows..."

187
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,277
"...play an intermediate role..."

188
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,388
between the breast
and the penis."

189
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,354
What's this?

190
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,272
A surprise.

191
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,394
It's a new spermicidal.

192
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,638
Science's latest find!

193
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,871
It'll help us a lot.

194
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,709
It's fool-proof.
A great contraceptive.

195
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,678
Must one stick it up?

196
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,359
Just a bit.

197
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,198
No, it's not poetic.

198
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,074
Don't be old-fashioned.

199
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,998
It's the latest thing.

200
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,510
Most modern people are using it.

201
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,749
- Just a little!
- No!

202
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,797
An umbrella can hide
such feelings...

203
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,595
I'm terribly alone.

204
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,674
Dorotéia, you're a bright angel...

205
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,998
...the dancer of mystic tangos.

206
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,194
The spring from where
poetry flows.

207
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,671
Even without knowing you,
everyone admires you!

208
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,310
Alone, but surrounded
by the greatest honor...

209
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,432
The applause of
the literary youth!

210
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,913
I can't bear it anymore!
That woman isn't my mother.

211
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,795
She falsified my papers,
it's all fake!

212
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,752
She says I'm wasting my time
with you.

213
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,633
That I could have
princes in my bed.

214
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,718
Let's escape to Ethiopia!

215
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,917
I'll abandon everything,
but you leave the old witch!

216
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,599
They want to kill love,
To subvert the pole...

217
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,951
To quench the thirst
I have for another.

218
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,993
They come from all sides.

219
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,760
If he comes, I'll defend you.

220
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,395
If she comes, I'll fight.

221
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,871
If they all come,
with raining arrows...

222
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,873
I will defend you!

223
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,717
You don't want to marry me.

224
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,717
I can't, my sweet.

225
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,070
Not even Lala I married,
with a son and all...

226
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,635
Haven't you heard my father?
He'd disinherit me.

227
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,239
I need time.

228
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,715
I won't live in the
boarding house!

229
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,075
It's a good home, my child.

230
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,556
We'll spend Carnival there.

231
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,196
Perhaps then, some people
will make up their minds...

232
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,951
Why do you only squirt
the others?

233
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,754
Why do you squirt everyone
but me?

234
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,313
I squirt who I want to.

235
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,433
The perfume squirter is mine!
Biriba gave it to me!

236
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,517
You don't love me.

237
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,837
You suffocate me.
I'm leaving for Rio.

238
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,509
I'm going to star in a movie.

239
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,994
Which film?

240
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,193
<i>Love and Patriotism</i>.

241
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,075
Who is the idiot directing it?

242
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,508
None of your business!
I'm leaving forever.

243
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,395
Get out of my life!

244
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,910
Hussy!
A whore a thousand times over!

245
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,428
Our great love,
killed by jealousy.

246
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,558
My kingdom for a wheelchair.

247
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,597
I've become the critic
of my own tragedy.

248
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,789
She could have left a letter,
written in violet.

249
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,192
Our love should've been protected.

250
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,754
Now, anything is possible.

251
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,269
Jails, courts, asylums...

252
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,437
The electric chair.

253
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,912
Madam Corina!
What a pleasure. Please sit down.

254
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,429
I had to come
and compliment you, Dr. Coelho.

255
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,349
Your poem about the little dog
that was raped in the street...

256
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,471
How moving!

257
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,597
That description
of the moral suffering...

258
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,195
...of that little animal!

259
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,597
How humane!

260
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,917
Moreover, it seems to me,
the poem is ironic.

261
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,511
I haven't penned it unfortunately...

262
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,958
The author died recently
in that absurd accident...

263
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,711
Was it he who visited Italy
and fell into Mount Vesuvius?

264
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,951
How extraordinary!

265
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,313
My friends, the surprise...

266
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,039
...I've been saving.

267
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,835
Dorotéia, the future
and promising star...

268
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,071
...of <i>Love and Patriotism</i>...

269
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,908
...a very important
Brazilian film.

270
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,998
This young girl will enchant us...

271
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,350
...with the magic whirlwind
of her art...

272
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,195
...reproducing the splendor
of the divine inner flame...

273
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,431
...of the bacchants of the spirit.

274
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,592
At the piano, her eminent mother.

275
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,758
Dance, Dorotéia...

276
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,955
...the rising sun
of our national art.

277
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,634
My dream is to deserve
the applause of the families.

278
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,195
She doesn't answer in S<i>ã</i>o Paulo.

279
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,472
That third generation whore!

280
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,075
For me, man is a microcosm...

281
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,508
...a summary of the Earth.

282
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,676
And thus guided by
immutable eternal laws.

283
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,555
I agree with these ideas...

284
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,751
...corroborated by science.

285
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,352
However there are eruptions,

286
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,870
cataclysms!

287
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,039
Dorotéia is my Etna in bloom.

288
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,154
The most extraordinary of whores!

289
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,674
She left for Rio without paying
the boarding house.

290
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,793
She's still there
frequenting the worst literary circles,

291
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,950
the highest degree
of national idiocy!

292
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,709
Let's trip them!

293
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,354
Let's fix them up in great style!

294
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,595
We'll do no literary politics.

295
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,438
Just intrigue.

296
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,912
Down with rich rhymes
and poor ideas!

297
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,794
We'll create the modern woman.

298
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,352
Cecil B. De Mille killed
the bad French theater.

299
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,870
Soaked, sick...

300
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,397
...rheumatized by a tradition...

301
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,280
...of artistic tears...

302
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,479
We demand surgery!

303
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,277
Removal of the tear glands!

304
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,394
Down with the yawn
as an aesthetic sensation!

305
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,750
And long live dizzying audacity!

306
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,838
We want athletic Dulcineas.

307
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,275
Don Quixote was a great athlete
in the wrong century.

308
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,676
Today, he would be
a champion horseman!

309
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,190
We don't care about being new.
We're contemporary.

310
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,829
Brazil wasn't discovered
by chance!

311
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,031
The intellectual sanitation begins.

312
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,512
Long live us! Down with the others!
Summon the intellectuals...

313
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,394
...even that dull Aranha.

314
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,157
The modernist revolution
has begun!

315
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,753
Agile the theater,
son of the acrobat!

316
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,238
Agile and illogical.
The novel born from invention.

317
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,070
Agile, our everyday poetry
The Brazilwood poetry!

318
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,273
Our themes shall be
the struggles

319
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,194
taking place in this huge city.

320
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,040
Workers fighting
for their rights...

321
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,920
The bourgeoisie defending
its savings.

322
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,119
Bureaucrats backsliding
on the rails of state rules...

323
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,318
Manufacturers competing
with each other.

324
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,473
Aristocrats showing off.

325
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,718
Politicians ascending.

326
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,834
Women breaking their secular handcuffs.

327
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,071
Poetry exists in facts.

328
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,911
The green slums and shacks...

329
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,193
...under the tropical sky,
are aesthetic facts!

330
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,513
Carnival is the religious
event of the people.

331
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,072
Brazilwood!
Barbarous and ours!

332
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,272
Synthesis, invention...

333
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,275
...a new perspective, a new code.

334
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,592
Language without archaisms,
or erudition...

335
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,793
...the millionaire contribution
of errors!

336
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,355
We speak as we are.

337
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,631
I insult the bourgeoisie.

338
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,878
The bourgeois-money,
the bourgeois-bourgeois.

339
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,355
S<i>ã</i>o Paulo's good digestion.

340
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,877
The bent-man. The rump-man.

341
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,080
The ever-cautious side...

342
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,558
The scholarly side,
the fatality of the first white...

343
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,229
...landing and dominating
the savage jungle.

344
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,990
Everyone to the center
of my inebriating rancor.

345
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,434
Red rage, fecund rage,
cyclic rage.

346
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,359
Out!

347
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,195
Out with the good bourgeois!

348
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,870
Imagine, I dreamt
I had a sex change...

349
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,752
...and I was your fiancé.

350
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,554
It's the downfall.

351
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,877
If I do nothing,
I'll lose myself.

352
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,198
I must act energetically at once.

353
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,992
Kidnap Dorotéia and get married
at the police station.

354
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,033
Yes, I have a plan.
I can't let her finish this film.

355
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,277
She'll be forced to kiss that
idiot hero at the end, as always.

356
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,073
We're going to Rio today.

357
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,635
We'll have a truck
at the hotel's entrance.

358
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,155
You'll pretend to be filming.

359
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,237
I already rented
the truck and the camera.

360
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,668
I arrive in a taxi...

361
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,349
...club the old lady
and grab Dorotéia.

362
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,393
If anyone asks for help,
you scream: It's a film!

363
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,358
...and nobody will react.

364
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,598
Camera! Action!

365
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,873
The next day, in the headlines:

366
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,276
"Star Honored By The Hardness
Of The Tropics."

367
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,949
Below, a photo of the kiss...

368
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,840
...with an obvious erection.

369
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,717
I warned her that the camera lens...

370
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,759
...would soil her for good.

371
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,112
Yesterday I weakened,
and I buggered Lalá.

372
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,518
But my attitude is now
absolutely stoic.

373
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,912
Total abstinence, isolation,
serious studies.

374
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,834
I spend days locked in my study.

375
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,794
By the way, yesterday

376
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,119
...a true Adonis moved
across the street.

377
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,360
I've been planted here
for two hours!

378
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,349
Didn't you get my telegram?
Where's the other one?

379
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,518
Outside, waiting.
He didn't want to come in.

380
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,280
Why? What's the matter with him?

381
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,830
Now, come!

382
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,720
Not only that photo appeared
in the paper...

383
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,912
...but he was there, he saw it.

384
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,468
Saw what?

385
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,034
That kiss in
<i>Love and Patriotism</i>...

386
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,231
...the leading man with
the hard-on.

387
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,511
Who had a hard-on?

388
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,991
Look, don't play innocent.

389
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,874
The leading man got a hard-on
while shooting...

390
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,430
it was in the papers...
Everyone saw it.

391
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,671
You call that nothing?

392
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,719
It's not my fault!
Was it my prick?

393
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,079
Let's say that a prick is not your
most notable attribute.

394
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,960
But the fact that certain pricks
have been your property...

395
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,875
...more or less private,
for more or less time...

396
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,310
...is a fact.

397
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,311
You've always thought
that I'm a whore, haven't you?

398
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,671
If I had the fare,
I'd take the first train.

399
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,911
And really become one.

400
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,037
It's not my fault
the guy got a hard-on!

401
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,557
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

402
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,634
Sometimes,
a slight touch is enough.

403
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,350
Or even a look.

404
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,957
The film stinks.

405
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,435
The actor is even more stupid
than the director.

406
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,950
They didn't even pay me.

407
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,952
My dance was crummy.

408
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,630
The critics ridiculed it.
My friends vanished.

409
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,876
I was unfaithful to you.

410
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,516
I went out with men...

411
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,679
...who chased me insistently.

412
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,834
Mother begged me.

413
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,991
Nothing much happened.

414
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,511
But I was unfaithful
to our dream.

415
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,912
I no longer deserve
the life we dreamed of.

416
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,591
Dorotéia, our dream is invincible.

417
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,794
These critics from Rio are fools.

418
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,278
You're a sly angel. An artist.

419
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,438
We'll launch your career
in S<i>ã</i>o Paulo.

420
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,671
And at the Opera, no less.

421
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,197
We'll bribe all the critics.

422
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,113
Thank you.

423
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,629
Thank you for coming.

424
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,191
The critics from Rio were unfair...

425
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,431
...with our young dancer.

426
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,231
You will now see a spectacle...

427
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,516
...of great simplicity.

428
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,630
You, the critics from S<i>ã</i>o Paulo...

429
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,671
...will recognize the talents
of our little Dorotéia.

430
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,270
The show is starting!

431
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,030
My legs are paralyzed.

432
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,634
I can't dance.

433
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,871
Don't be a smart ass.

434
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,156
The critics are waiting. Dance!

435
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,754
What's up?

436
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,672
She's got a nervous paralysis...

437
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,788
The number is starting.
Dance! Immediately!

438
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,679
No dead weight!

439
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,911
- Hold on!
- Go!

440
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,078
Please excuse us,
but she's not well.

441
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,635
It's purely psychological.

442
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,199
- Back off!
- Son of a bitch!

443
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,274
Get up, you're heavy!

444
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,916
Quick, the Juvenile Court!

445
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,557
- Bitch!
- Cads!

446
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,395
Out of my way,
I want to speak to the judge.

447
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,796
- Speak to my lawyer...
- Is she a minor?

448
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,230
It's a serious affair.
She's my client.

449
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,593
It's not allowed to put
anything on this table!

450
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,195
What's going on here?

451
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,235
Your honor, this child is being
exploited and debased...

452
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,996
...by this woman who says
she's her mother, but isn't.

453
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,952
Enough!

454
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,428
- The poor girl's just fainted...
- This woman is a pimp...

455
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,633
An exploiter, a shrew...

456
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,838
They abducted my daughter!
Bandits! You fakes!

457
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,993
Get up at once!

458
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,156
I'm this ingrate's mother,
Your Honor.

459
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,998
I can prove that these
are creeps!

460
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,988
This one's a scorpion
and that one a red spider.

461
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,999
I can explain it, Your Honor!

462
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,034
The minor will be
put in a reformatory.

463
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,877
Oh, no! For Christ's sake!
I'm her mother!

464
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,235
Enough!

465
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,557
What relationship have you got
with the minor?

466
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,956
- Where's the father or the tutor?
- I'm the mother!

467
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,118
Enough! Quiet!

468
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,637
I must proceed to the
gynecological exam.

469
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,428
Your Honor, is this
really necessary?

470
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,595
Don't spread your legs!

471
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,995
Spread them!

472
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,596
Let go of me! Let go!

473
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,635
Take this man off me!

474
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,672
It's good to see you.

475
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,513
"LEADING MAN IS NOT THE FATHER"

476
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,676
Did you believe that story?

477
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,838
Look at my belly.
You really believe I'm pregnant?

478
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,552
Only if by God.
Now I'm God's bride.

479
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,478
I belong to Him only.

480
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,911
I can't stay long.

481
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,550
Put this on your father's grave.

482
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,111
Will you leave me
this newspaper?

483
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,278
I'd like the photo
as a keepsake.

484
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,918
You'll excuse me...

485
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,509
...but the Parnassians
are totally obsolete,

486
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,671
verse machines.

487
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,996
Times changed.

488
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,876
Recently a businessman cashed
the same check several times...

489
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,548
...with the aid of photo-collage.

490
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,789
An innovation in Brazil, finally!

491
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,629
Do tell me everything, quickly.

492
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,469
Despite the booing,
the Art's Week was a success.

493
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,399
Henceforth, no one will dare
to write prettily!

494
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,238
You can't be circumspect...

495
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,353
...if you want to renovate art:

496
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,914
One doesn't need to be boring
to be serious.

497
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,714
So nice of you to come.
We must talk.

498
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,476
Social snobs open their doors
to modern art.

499
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,870
My dear Branca Clara...

500
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,514
When one begins to fancy
our stores windows...

501
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,276
...it's time to re-visit Paris.

502
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,236
I want to escape, leave.

503
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,758
I don't know,
play golf, badminton...

504
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,639
...have fun, go wild!

505
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,791
We, the modern poets...

506
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,311
...are the aspirins of madness
and junkyards.

507
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,830
The 'Cloud-Breaker'
is pulling anchor soon, as you know.

508
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,760
We could travel together.

509
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,511
Wonderful! When do we leave?

510
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,715
Branca...

511
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,309
Branca Clara...

512
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,593
...what could be awaiting us
after so many waiting rooms?

513
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,034
I'm a loner, my dear sirs.
Bored in First Class.

514
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,233
Existence means little to me.

515
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,997
São Paulo, Paris, Luxor, Ashwan...

516
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,880
...the dams of the Upper Nile...

517
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,751
...nothing satisfies me.

518
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,473
Life is dull, my friends.

519
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,830
Yes, next to you, Madam.

520
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,990
But, take this little red purse.

521
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,433
It'll make you look like a hussy.

522
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,718
Perhaps not very elegant
in the street, in daytime.

523
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,554
But, at night, in bed...

524
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,155
I only ask an "après-minuit"
of your life.

525
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,039
What is an "après-minuit" anyway?

526
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,151
We'll part at 1 a. M...

527
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,828
but you'll carry in your body
the pride...

528
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,594
...of having made love
to a modern poet.

529
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,598
You enchant me.

530
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,230
Stop. Don't bewitch me...

531
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,237
For your Mother's soul sake...

532
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,032
I'd like to fill your pockets...

533
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,277
...with loaded,
drugged cigarettes.

534
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,916
Hold the hairs
of your hairless body...

535
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,909
...the belly that points
to the cold center of the Earth.

536
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,675
My dear Sir,
all men whoever came near me...

537
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,113
...went limp! All of them!

538
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,313
I'm completely anxious.

539
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,194
I dreamt I had sex...

540
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,755
...with Jesus Christ
and other gods!

541
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,799
Don't you think that's too much?

542
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,274
You know what I think of you, Madam?

543
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,878
That you're your own victim.

544
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,000
An impassive victim.

545
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,874
Explain everything, please.

546
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,475
Simple, Madam.

547
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,594
You should leave us
sufficient space...

548
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,710
...for a few cynical jabs
of psychoanalysis.

549
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,555
I permit everything, gentlemen.

550
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,755
Except one thing...

551
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,991
A capricious personality...

552
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,470
...never finding happiness...

553
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,038
...calmly surrendered
to pleasure...

554
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,155
to the ephemeral pleasures...

555
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,789
An analysis and then some...
Shit!

556
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,548
You've already suffered too much.

557
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,680
Don't you see that's over?

558
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,873
You're in a state...

559
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,191
...that can be truly dangerous...

560
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,714
Not for yourself...

561
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,031
...but for the rest
of the male mankind.

562
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,551
Our faith in life...

563
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,394
...could be useful to you
in this delicate moment.

564
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,874
Our permanent dynamite
of willpower...

565
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,395
No.
Why restart this endless game?

566
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,434
For me, it's like potato race...

567
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,320
I'm not interested.

568
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,350
If you like...

569
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,833
...send a written
declaration of love to my cabin.

570
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,558
It's the night watchman.
A message for Madam Branca Clara.

571
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,637
Come in and read it.

572
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,555
It's long!

573
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,795
Read it.

574
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,474
"Madam..."

575
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,351
..."our pride crumbled..."

576
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,553
"...before the chirping
of your gestures."

577
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,269
"Meanwhile, note
that from these words..."

578
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,358
"carelessly put down on paper,
like a billionaire's gold..."

579
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,232
"...on a roulette wheel,"

580
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,434
"rises, like a phallus
inside the pants..."

581
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,359
"...the hard nerve of a personality".

582
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,668
"You, on the other hand,
are a gutless chicken..."

583
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,590
"...only interested
in two things:"

584
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,878
"Greyhounds and chewing gum".

585
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,274
"Since tender childhood,
we've endured..."

586
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,990
"...the battle
of the crocodiles..."

587
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,033
"...and of the earthworms
of our native country".

588
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,274
"You look for exterior beauty..."

589
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,156
"...while we, on the contrary,
search for the beauty within".

590
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,551
"You are given to whims..."

591
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,794
"...while we, to the masculine fight".

592
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,870
"In our free time, we practice..."

593
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,754
"...hitting below the belt".

594
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,389
"This stand-offish happiness
that we protect..."

595
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,717
"...was achieved, like by
the other men,"

596
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,911
"through humiliations
and piracy."

597
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,954
"It is in fact, made of pacts
with the non-existent".

598
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,869
"But tonight, love hits us."

599
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:53,478
"From the bridge
of the Transatlantic..."

600
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,680
"...we see this
humiliating mardi-gras..."

601
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,477
"...of all these fools
aboard..."

602
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,237
"...we compare the solar scorn..."

603
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,835
"...of our new friend..."

604
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,272
"...lying, by now,
in her orthopedic bed..."

605
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,551
"...with all the rest".

606
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,549
"Signed: Oswald".

607
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,593
St Joseph...

608
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,754
Patron Saint of Fools.

609
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,709
What a kiss.

610
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,591
It went all the way down...

611
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,630
How I miss
Miss Bankhurst's advice.

612
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,400
Whatever he wants, it's there.

613
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,438
I gave him all.
For the first time.

614
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,595
My spherical breasts, my belly.

615
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,028
But he has obstinate hands.

616
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,274
He wants to get there,
at the division of my being.

617
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,111
He made me play
with his perfume squirter.

618
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,995
He licked my pussy.

619
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,913
I never knew it was so nice.

620
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,069
And the other way around...

621
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,151
Good idea, Captain.

622
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,351
Such an ingénue...

623
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,595
Portside.

624
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,353
Excuse-me.

625
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,149
Starboard, shit!

626
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,677
Branca... Branca Clara.

627
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,270
Why this anesthetic suicide?

628
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,920
To love is vulgar, dear sir.

629
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,468
Another?

630
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,119
Thank you, I'm full.

631
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,153
I just want to wash my hands
and take a piss.

632
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,556
An eggnog?

633
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,789
I'm afraid it'll give me gas.

634
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,231
After so many years,
for the first time...

635
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,356
...my weary heart blushes.

636
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,874
At last, I can touch happiness,
worn in a man's suit.

637
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,030
Shall I wait in vain
for the masked bandit...

638
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,271
...to steal my pearls...

639
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,550
...and rape
my anti-hygienic virginity?

640
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,279
No, let's do it now.

641
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,110
On a full stomach.

642
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,676
Ah, Paris, Paris...

643
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,154
City of lights.

644
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,717
The Seine, the Eiffel Tower...

645
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,594
The Louvre, Pigalle.

646
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,034
Maître...

647
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,911
Please, try
our black tobacco.

648
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,799
Typically Brazilian.

649
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,192
Eat, drink, smoke it
and fall down.

650
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,637
La cachaça...

651
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,074
My dear Jacques...
I find the <i>feijoada</i> tastes like shit.

652
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,748
But this cachaça...

653
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,313
<i>C'est absolument détestable!</i>

654
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,148
Is anybody looking?

655
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,799
No, all clear.

656
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,719
It's gone. <i>Discrètement.</i>

657
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,838
Without offending
your Brazilian pride...

658
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,469
...I must say,
you're a Russian princess.

659
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,917
Beautiful, generous, amiable.

660
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,191
Your studio is as original...

661
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,677
...as your canvasses
are beautiful.

662
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,120
Big spaces always attracted me,

663
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,078
my dear poet.

664
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,634
Traveling is my life's leitmotiv.

665
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,117
But now, I'm traveling
within myself...

666
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,358
...with my two new friends.

667
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,239
And not only spiritually.

668
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,632
To leave, travel, forget parents...

669
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,234
Dogs...

670
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,472
And lovers!
Adventure is what counts.

671
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,990
What is Brazil actually?

672
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,231
A slave philosophy...

673
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,478
...braced in the depths
of national character.

674
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,990
Prince Tovalu!

675
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,517
A rare example
of our cultural roots.

676
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,076
My latest composition;
"The Brazilian Woodpecker".

677
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,796
A rhombic piece...

678
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,669
with the empathy of heavy humor.

679
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,430
One doesn't sense the design...

680
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,191
Oswald, can I slap this faggot?

681
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,874
Of course, my dear.

682
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,391
You know, M'am, in my country,

683
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,952
There is a small village
called Brazi.

684
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,470
"Corruption of Brazil", you know.

685
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,310
It's a town of old slaves

686
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,470
who made an illustrious entry
among us.

687
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,359
Brazil in Africa.

688
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,636
They had taken over
the names of their masters:

689
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:11,194
Nogueira, Camargo, Mesquita, etc.

690
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,834
Oh, you little niggers are so delicious!
<i>Que c'est mignon</i>!

691
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,555
I'm sorry, Madam.
My name is "Filet".

692
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,589
Please sit down.

693
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,712
Here, my latest painting.

694
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,835
It's called "The Negress".

695
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,994
A metaphysical portrait
of my black mother.

696
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,880
An image asleep for a long time
in my unconscious...

697
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,475
that I recovered by reading Freud...

698
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,991
which they made me swallow.

699
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,353
What do you think?

700
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,398
But... it's grandma!

701
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,271
Who? The dry cleaner?

702
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,557
Tell him to come up. No wait.

703
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,434
I'll see him tomorrow at 3:30.

704
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,032
My tea and toast!

705
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,592
Your stockings are so sheer!
Do they last?

706
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,279
For three... four hours.

707
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,236
You're so silent and spiritless...

708
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,599
Tongues that lick themselves
as in the best kennels.

709
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,997
And I, who expected myself
to be cynical forever!

710
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,435
You talked about embellishing
the passing days.

711
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,278
With someone else,
I would burst out laughing.

712
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,879
But your simplicity,

713
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,990
your barbarity...

714
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,398
I never thought
you were so strong.

715
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,797
You're held in the atmosphere
that you yourself created.

716
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,476
Fornication is delectable.

717
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,317
I'm the newest and the
most beautiful of loves...

718
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,670
...in a new skin...

719
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,390
You're the answer in life's
vast telephonic dialog.

720
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,514
When we foxtrot in these hotels...

721
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,439
...with rotten orchestras...

722
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,917
...I feel your breasts prick my heart...

723
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,397
...and I take your warm ass...

724
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,993
...muscular, lively,
like in the best Charlestons...

725
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,475
Love's effects...

726
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,198
Today, I was nude in my room...

727
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,355
...and noticed
my thighs got rounder.

728
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,038
My tits became hard...

729
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,319
...by the labor of your hands.

730
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,277
And now my nipples itch.

731
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,873
The light comes from above.

732
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,117
Let's see these two for now.
They're not bad at all.

733
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:44,155
Four days of joy and parades
that take over the capital.

734
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,874
Carnival is unique, Blaise.

735
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,034
The bacchanals of antiquity...

736
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,311
...are no comparison.

737
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,477
Total debauchery.

738
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,956
You can't miss it!

739
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,277
This is more symbolist.
That one's more radical...

740
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,871
...more ironic,
absurd, provocative!

741
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,351
Paulo, finally I'll see the sun.

742
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,191
Just existing is happiness.

743
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,349
Thanks to you, I found Brazil.

744
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,834
I'm as happy as a king...

745
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,111
Free like a man.

746
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,280
Let's go.

747
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,994
You only steal
from whom you love.

748
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,514
<i>Mal de mer</i>, my dear...
<i>Mal de mer...</i>

749
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,953
It's always like that,
my dear big Olive.

750
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,157
Going is always better
than coming back.

751
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,270
Especially, from Paris...

752
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,473
Ah, Paris...

753
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,075
If you lift your bust
over the ocean...

754
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,675
...you'll see, my dear sir...

755
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,598
...Brazil.

756
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,479
Like a harp or a ham,

757
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,952
with the Andes behind.

758
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,518
Even birds have trouble
in going over them.

759
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,716
- The Sugar Loaf is artificial!
- <i>Mais quelle merveille</i>!

760
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,274
Brazilian women are so chic...

761
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,756
that they're not content
with taffeta.

762
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,675
They're so bejeweled...

763
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:33,359
that it seems
that rubies and diamonds...

764
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,837
rained on them.

765
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,748
All delicious...

766
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,674
The Indians don't have
the verb "to be".

767
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,552
Therein lies the difficulty
in making them moral creatures.

768
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,993
The most you can get
is a suckling Christian.

769
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,837
People there are born
with tails...

770
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,078
Tails?
All people have tails, señor.

771
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,036
What changes is
the use one makes of it.

772
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,795
Surely, dear Madam.

773
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,713
Montaigne said:
"We're all animals".

774
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,838
Not everyone, dear sir...

775
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,111
In our country, Blaise...

776
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,994
...we have one called the 'sloth'.

777
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,758
His neck hairs stand on end...

778
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,632
and it moves so slowly...

779
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,957
...that even hurrying,
he takes fifteen days...

780
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,233
...to cover a child's
stone throw.

781
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,638
But, we also have
the wild eagle.

782
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,078
And "emus" so big
that their wings...

783
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:43,514
...look like enormous sails
in the wind.

784
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:48,313
Even St. Domingo
lost patience.

785
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,954
He said:

786
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,118
"If you won't
listen to my pleas..."

787
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,038
"...I'll club you to conversion."

788
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,277
It seems the Indians
are a sad race, aren't they?

789
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,393
All animals are sad
post-coitum.

790
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,591
It's universal.

791
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,309
Our famous Duchess
of Santos should know...

792
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,790
Remember Our Lord.

793
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,038
He lived in Jerusalem
and other great cities.

794
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,712
He only passed through
the smaller ones.

795
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,719
Four centuries of beef!
Scandalous!

796
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,834
Let's have frog's legs.

797
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,078
If not with too much garlic,
they're delicious.

798
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,555
Now, let's get to the widows...

799
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,717
...our greatest source of income.

800
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,514
Always exaggerate
our troubles with them.

801
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,676
Thus, we can profit
from their pity.

802
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,874
Even if we must resort
to violence.

803
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,996
It seems that Champagne
in Paris has less alcohol.

804
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,234
It must be delicious...

805
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,871
There comes our food, jumping!

806
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,154
"Tupi or not Tupi,
that is the question!"

807
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,398
To be or not to be Tupi,
that is the question!

808
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,910
Down with spiritual dictators!

809
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,397
What matters now are dentures!

810
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,471
Freedom for frogs!

811
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,438
Have mercy...

812
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,435
The Indians didn't have mercy.

813
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,717
Just contempt.

814
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,830
Hans Staden saved himself
by crying.

815
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,988
Your Archbishop "Sardinha",
all macho that he was,

816
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,918
...was eaten alive.

817
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,395
Not from behind, surely.

818
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,272
Brazilians...

819
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,957
Only anthropophagi unites us!

820
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,313
We're all anthropophagous!

821
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:44,669
Anthropophagi flows
from the lack of fauna.

822
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,111
It is the basis of the
instinctive aesthetic of Brazil.

823
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,392
The destruction
of imported idols.

824
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,235
The totemic ascension
of the national revelry!

825
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,317
I want to be crowned
the Queen of the Anthropophagous!

826
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,039
We'll take care of that.

827
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,118
Gentlemen! Never have ideals
or religious questions existed,

828
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,795
which haven't been resolved
through blows!

829
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,638
Historically!

830
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,469
Down with Father Vieira
who made our first foreign loan...

831
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,034
...to get a commission.

832
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,198
Down with low anthropophagi...

833
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,392
...clustered in the sins
of catechism.

834
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,320
We'll attack the dove of peace!

835
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,514
At times, I think that God,
in flooding the earth...

836
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,395
...made His only error: Noah!

837
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,871
I decided to leave at once.

838
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,111
Poetry is exploding worldwide.

839
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,358
I came to live an adventure.

840
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,234
You're lucky not to be bookworms.

841
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,398
What are three or
four centuries of history...

842
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,188
...in terms of this savage
and prolific continent?

843
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,631
The time it takes for the worms
to devour the libraries...

844
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,877
...and for men to knock down
jungles and to reproduce.

845
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,674
Down with theories!
Civilization! That's it:

846
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,316
Establishing Man in a climate,
come what may.

847
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,917
When purchasing land,
always use a friend's name...

848
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,840
who's trustworthy and secretive...

849
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,674
...so as to better show our poverty.

850
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,313
Please, don't touch this.

851
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,399
They're only cult objects,
no value whatsoever.

852
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,955
Religious objects.

853
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,553
At customs, everything has value.

854
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,513
No need to open.
Discipline instruments.

855
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,199
Thirty bottles of perfume!

856
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,874
Impossible!
You have to pay tax.

857
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,358
Let's settle this between us.

858
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,278
Afterwards.

859
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,395
Brazil needs the work
of strong arms.

860
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,989
You're missing one.
You can't come in.

861
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,633
What a lack of respect!

862
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,955
How absurd!

863
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,435
He's a French intellectual!

864
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,119
He's not a worker...

865
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,277
What of it? You creep.

866
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,119
He's not immigrating.
He's a tourist.

867
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,679
Only in Brazil.

868
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,268
Disgusting country!

869
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,433
Please, come in.
A Frenchman, here.

870
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,554
What a great day! I'm so...
Oh, forgive me.

871
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,440
I'm so happy, my dear Sir.

872
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,035
A French poet!

873
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,958
I adore France...

874
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,111
You're the first
Frenchman to ever come here.

875
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,799
The first!

876
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,952
Feel free. My house is yours.

877
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,595
Breno is at your service.

878
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,513
It's too much for me.

879
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,671
Permit me to take some air...

880
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,834
...we'll meet afterwards.
We have a lot to talk about.

881
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,758
You're very kind.

882
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,513
Breno, I need a good hot bath...

883
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,956
Master Padroso is quite nervous...
understandably so.

884
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,794
I too love France,
Monsieur Blaise.

885
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,674
My daughter was to be called,
'Battle of the Marne'...

886
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,316
...but we only got
as far as 'Joffrinette'.

887
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,792
I'm sorry to come so late.

888
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,037
Not at all.

889
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,550
Master Padroso has no set hours.

890
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,434
Sometimes he dines at 2 a.m.

891
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,951
We're used to it.
He's sub lunar.

892
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,872
Somnambulist you mean.

893
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,079
No, sub lunar.
It's the moon that makes him walk.

894
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,271
Be frank, Breno.

895
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,314
What's this animal up there?

896
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,591
You noticed it?

897
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,911
Something's spying on us.

898
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,669
Don't say the name,
it's listening.

899
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,511
It's a rattlesnake,
queen of these lands.

900
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,110
My white suit, please.

901
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,675
Master Padroso must be waiting.

902
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,878
Finally, my dear friend.

903
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,310
Come and see my discovery:

904
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,870
A new constellation.

905
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,710
I want to ask you a favor:

906
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:20,234
Register it officially in Paris.

907
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,432
My life's dream.

908
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,069
My supreme homage to France.

909
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,317
Finding the Eiffel Tower...

910
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,636
...in our austral hemisphere.

911
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,115
It's France's
spiritual projection.

912
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,950
As I informed the Academy of Sciences,

913
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,510
it's not merely a whim.

914
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,350
The Institute didn't answer me!

915
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,234
In spite of the proofs I've sent!

916
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,438
Like the astronomical photos

917
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,314
which confirm my discovery.

918
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,035
And all of my notes...

919
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:03,995
...that I've sent since
the Battle of the Marne.

920
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,517
Come. Look!

921
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,350
See for yourself...

922
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,032
The sidereal Eiffel Tower.

923
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,395
<i>Quelle merveille</i>!

924
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,599
It makes one dizzy to think...

925
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,873
That each of these shrubs
built a sky-scraper in S<i>ã</i>o Paulo.

926
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,031
That another brought to Santos

927
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,709
a ship laden with European luxuries.

928
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,157
It's incredible.
Why so much coffee?

929
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,997
Why this need of intoxication...

930
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,238
...since the beginning of times?

931
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,398
Every epoch has its drug.

932
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,280
As our modernists say...

933
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,434
...the thing now is the
import-export of human meat.

934
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,270
Big iceboxes,
great slaughter houses.

935
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,515
Canned scoundrels.

936
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,953
Finally, the diversification
of exports.

937
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,718
The end of monoculture.

938
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,553
How am I not to be a communist
if I'm modern?

939
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,718
The proletariat prepares
for the final assault.

940
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,917
While the rich have a ball...

941
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,079
...the humiliated cooks
conspire in the kitchens.

942
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,280
The bourgeoisie wavers.

943
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,638
You're quite wrong.

944
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,752
Not only in art. Also in life.

945
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,679
You're the painful middle class.

946
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,719
Ah, this heart too alive to stagnate.

947
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,388
Rosa. I'm a feudal upbringing...

948
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,557
...in the 20th century!

949
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,069
This bench you're sitting on...

950
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,989
...is very insensitive.

951
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,791
You must understand art
in it's material causes.

952
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,317
Modernism is the peak
of the coffee bourgeoisie.

953
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,797
You modernists are exactly
like coffee.

954
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,390
Your valorization
is entirely artificial.

955
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,512
Imagine. We, anonymous artists
of the revolution.

956
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,628
A bourgeois like you.
Marxist by accident...

957
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,195
...will at most be towed
by the proletariat.

958
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,272
Be careful. I'll jump!

959
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,834
Life is the conflict of classes!

960
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,439
My God, the archangels' revolt...

961
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,353
...was the first class struggle!

962
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,231
Rosa, will you fuck me?

963
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,475
Us!

964
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,640
The sexual question
is secondary.

965
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,880
What do you think
about anthropophagi?

966
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,792
I don't "think it", I like it.

967
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,672
And modernism?

968
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,834
It's like the coffee graph.
Right now it's low.

969
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,071
I feel middle class:

970
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,276
Between the hammer and the sickle.

971
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,911
What a growing sexuality!

972
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,754
Our first phase...

973
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,270
...was Export Poetry...

974
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,835
against import-colonization.

975
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,077
Anthropophagi is the ideological apex.

976
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,954
The rising wave of the future!

977
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,151
Dearest, not everything
that grows is soft.

978
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,753
Brazilwood first, anytime.

979
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,636
Governor, I didn't come to Brazil
to make films.

980
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,475
On the contrary,
I didn't even want to hear about it.

981
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,269
But traveling through
your marvelous country...

982
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,198
I said to my companions:

983
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,074
It's too beautiful...
too spectacular.

984
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,271
No one can imagine a country
like this.

985
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,111
Silence! Beware of the dog!

986
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,634
Careful of the tilt. Slow down.

987
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,957
Attention. Take care with this shit.

988
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,312
The hole, I told you!

989
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,557
You made this hole?

990
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,711
Seeing the countryside...

991
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,958
...I was so charmed,
I bought a jungle...

992
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,470
...not for profit or speculation...

993
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,319
...but with the intent of returning.

994
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,229
Upon my return to France
I'll search for the financing...

995
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:50,070
...to make a film in this country.

996
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,509
- "Independence or Death"
- "Long Live Brazil!"

997
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,474
...but a great documentary capturing reality.

998
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,989
My stars will be the stars of Brazil.

999
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,835
Nature, the light, the jungle...

1000
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,355
...and a giant river,
like the Tietê...

1001
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,831
...which historically was the way
to penetrate the jungle.

1002
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,670
I heard, Governor,
you have an obsession:

1003
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,911
History.

1004
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,475
A friend told me that your thesis...

1005
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,598
...traced the history
of a family in S<i>ã</i>o Paulo.

1006
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,360
I read it. Would you permit me...

1007
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,437
...to use as the basis for my film?

1008
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:33,630
Not only may you use my modest study...

1009
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,434
...as your screenplay, but also...

1010
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,430
...I wish to have the honor
of financing your project.

1011
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,189
After all it's
a 100% Brazilian film.

1012
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,628
Alerted by friends,
I took the liberty to ask...

1013
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,911
...a Treasury Bond...

1014
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,397
...for 50 million...

1015
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,510
...which is my pleasure to sign
and turn over to you.

1016
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,512
This is a secret mission!

1017
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,235
We can't get the Palace
from here...

1018
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,033
...but the Defense Department
is in our line of fire.

1019
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,553
Isn't this is a job
for our double agent?

1020
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,958
A military mutiny?

1021
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,431
They're going to bomb the Palace?

1022
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,833
The only safe place
is the Defense Department?

1023
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,911
Let's go there immediately.

1024
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,790
This is the first time
in the history of Ballistics...

1025
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,468
...that instead of the
bullet searching for the target...

1026
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,592
...it is the target that searches
for the bullet.

1027
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,637
This never was a revolution.
Both sides...

1028
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,911
...have a mutual interest...

1029
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,799
...stockholders of the same
bankrupted crowd.

1030
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,919
One must side with the exploited,

1031
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,151
against the great parasitical trusts...

1032
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,074
...that live off of our
Turkish bath of workers.

1033
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,278
You believed in the
high society's comedy.

1034
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,835
You've contaminated yourselves...

1035
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,674
...gotten stuck in the mud
of this perverse bourgeoisie.

1036
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,235
Which nowadays
hardly defends itself.

1037
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,120
I don't want any more of it,
I quit.

1038
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,318
Today, a memorable day...

1039
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,478
...we rid ourselves of two cows:

1040
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,399
- Branca Clara...
- And the bourgeoisie!

1041
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,518
Bravo, comrades!

1042
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,958
Isn't my misery beautiful?

1043
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,437
It's beautiful, Cesar.
I never want to leave here.

1044
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,918
Nothing better than a
revolutionary grub at Cesar's.

1045
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,994
People say that my house
is a chicken coop.

1046
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,839
Comrades, our two friends here...

1047
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,351
...until today were clowns
of the bourgeoisie!

1048
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,874
Bearded in London...

1049
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,754
...I ran into Karl Marx,
not knowing that he existed.

1050
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,951
I often got stuck...

1051
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,191
...in reactionary ditches.

1052
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,071
For me, the opposite of the bourgeois...

1053
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,954
...wasn't the proletariat
but the Bohemian.

1054
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,432
My epitaph of the man I was...

1055
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,035
...will be the obituary
of the bourgeoisie!

1056
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,430
Faggots, opportunists, rebels...

1057
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,354
...conservative and sexual...

1058
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,631
...now they're at most...

1059
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,429
...the lancers of the
Proletarian Revolution.

1060
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,598
Heroic tasks, for who was an altar-boy...

1061
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,831
...square-danced in the countryside...

1062
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,793
...and dressed as a Turk
on board of a cruise.

1063
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,589
I know the road is hard...

1064
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,118
...numerous vices
and hesitations.

1065
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,715
But turning back is impossible.

1066
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,838
History is like my watch.
It only runs forward!

1067
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,679
My sons: Marx and Engels.

1068
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,433
Comrades,
imperialism defends itself.

1069
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,678
They want to smother...

1070
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,235
...the revolt
that the exploited lead...

1071
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,754
The U.S.A. Sends us cinema...

1072
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,120
England, soccer; Italy, priests...

1073
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,950
...and France, prostitution!

1074
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,636
Is "sucking" imperialism?

1075
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:58,598
Let's get serious,
the fight approaches.

1076
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,597
The comrade wants to split us.

1077
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,837
Demoralize our blocks...

1078
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,031
...and take control
of our strike.

1079
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,598
Down with bossism
in the labor movement!

1080
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,430
The bourgeois avant-garde
penetrates the proletariat...

1081
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,671
...disguising itself as the left.

1082
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,432
Comrades, we must avoid
ideological immobilism.

1083
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,711
The bourgeoisie has lost its meaning.

1084
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,632
Now it crumbles and divides.

1085
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,518
The good bourgeois of today...

1086
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,711
...might be the revolutionary
of tomorrow!

1087
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:36,030
Bourgeois is bourgeois, fuck!

1088
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,995
I've given up for good
the filthy morals...

1089
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,918
...and politics of the bourgeoisie.

1090
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,313
I'll prove its validity
in the fight.

1091
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:13,154
Your political line is perfect!

1092
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:30,471
We're here to strike, now!

1093
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,753
They take the bread from our mouths...

1094
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,031
...cut our wages.

1095
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,231
We can't allow that!

1096
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,270
Our kids go hungry. Strike!

1097
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,437
The fight is now.
At night, we don't even have strength...

1098
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,993
...to cradle our kids.

1099
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,794
But lamentations weaken the strike.

1100
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,714
We must unite to fight the bourgeoisie!

1101
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,230
...who turn us into rags...

1102
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,791
...and take the last drop of milk
from our breasts...

1103
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,311
...to live on champagne and parasitism.

1104
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,550
Dear comrades,
our wages are late.

1105
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,434
Our bosses live luxuriously...

1106
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,230
...but we won't be slaves forever!

1107
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,268
They defend themselves
with armed lackeys.

1108
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,469
But we too...

1109
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:45,468
...can defend ourselves.

1110
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:52,637
Comrades, let's unite
against the bourgeoisie!

1111
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,118
Police repression incites
us to fight!

1112
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,679
For the freedom of
our friends in prison!

1113
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,513
Strike!

1114
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,910
A general strike...

1115
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,430
...against the bourgeoisie
and their armed lackeys!

1116
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,357
Don't shoot your brothers...

1117
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,280
...shoot your officers!

1118
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,474
They kill the workers,
but the proletariat won't die!

1119
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:33,548
Murderers! Bastards!

1120
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:43,190
Rosa, you must know the story
of the old woman...

1121
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,790
...who wouldn't open the door...

1122
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,310
...thinking it was the landlord...

1123
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,240
...but in fact was a friend...

1124
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,075
...coming to give her money.

1125
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,118
I know you won't refuse
to hear the word of God.

1126
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,788
Open the door.

1127
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,594
I'm warning you.
You'd better not go inside.

1128
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,918
You know...

1129
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,232
that nigger who died at the meeting...

1130
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,590
...his funeral was a no show.

1131
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,712
Inspector,
at Christ's funeral...

1132
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,558
only three people attended.

1133
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:26,398
It's your responsibility.
I'm warning you.

1134
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,913
Everybody has sinned,
Rosa Lituana...

1135
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,916
...you're no exception, nor I.

1136
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,790
If you ask what to do now...

1137
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,674
...with your life...

1138
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,709
...the Bible has a diagnosis.
Listen:

1139
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,670
The importance of the Works.

1140
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,918
"Not all who say onto me, Lord... '</i>'

1141
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:59,034
She's crazy. Dangerous. Violent.

1142
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,271
Let her be, you witch!

1143
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,111
I'm getting you out of here.

1144
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,595
The lyrical catacombs
either waste themselves...

1145
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,870
...or flow into the
political trenches.

1146
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,158
Get into your tanks,
you fucking intellectuals!

1147
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,074
Joy is the final proof!

1148
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,431
Do you like beer?

1149
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,237
To sell.
I only drink champagne.

1150
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,115
I'm like my friend, Ford,
who only drives Rolls Royces.

1151
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,000
Pardon my timidity.

1152
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,914
Cleopatra,
the Queen of this Whorehouse!

1153
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,193
A shame Cleopatra
didn't rule over Greece...

1154
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,356
Man conquered woman...

1155
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,279
...and she crowned the winner!

1156
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,597
Spermatozoids,
here is your prison!

1157
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,233
The rubber!
I should've invented it!

1158
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,432
What's this henhouse?

1159
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,558
The first to speak will get
a cannonball up his ass!

1160
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,070
Today, nobody fucks!

1161
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,591
Not even up the ass!

1162
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,071
We haven't even earned
dinner yet!

1163
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,954
"Have mercy on the whores!"

1164
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,192
"Give us today our daily cock..."

1165
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,398
"Remember you too got paid
to screw."

1166
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,868
Oh, gonorrhea!

1167
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,880
Clap! Cancer!

1168
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,711
We've got to regulate this profession!

1169
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,634
You fucking fairies!

1170
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,073
A woman's job is not to fuck
nor to give birth!

1171
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,911
It's to salute the flag.

1172
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,710
Remember your aunts,
the Amazons.

1173
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,594
Joan of Arc, your grandmother...

1174
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,195
Pulquéria, our own heroine...

1175
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,313
...who alone, breast fed
18 sergeants...

1176
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,351
...during the Paraguayan War.

1177
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,109
Get a lifesaver.
We gotta jump in the water.

1178
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,998
Sailors! Know how to fuck?

1179
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,918
Yeah!

1180
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:30,193
Then you know how to eat.
To eat and to fuck...

1181
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,357
...all men are prepared.

1182
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,200
The ether is finished.
Garçon, whiskey!

1183
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,033
Sailors, get up!

1184
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,277
The spirit of revolt has come
to the depths of the furnaces...

1185
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,959
...where you toast your veins.

1186
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,151
Now, you dance...

1187
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,472
...and you the bosses,
get to work!

1188
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,557
I'm going to call the police.

1189
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,075
Form a militia
of rich men's sons.

1190
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,550
Socialism is Soviet power...

1191
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,638
...plus electrification.

1192
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,514
Naval aviation has abandoned us...

1193
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,517
...the decadence of monogamy...

1194
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,440
...the ruin of bourgeois morale...

1195
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,911
Clearly, freedom was near!

1196
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,478
No more repression of clothes!

1197
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,069
Clothes hide the truth!

1198
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,350
I'm a nudist for health.

1199
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,199
What an idea!

1200
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,075
Get into the water to expose ideas!

1201
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,552
From the horse to horse-power...

1202
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,791
...from one animal to another...

1203
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,310
...that's the great
Leninist metaphor.

1204
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,878
This bastard will pay.

1205
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:42,437
He destroyed two bungalows
of mine.

1206
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,277
We must do something
before it's too late.

1207
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,151
Today I received a call
at 2 a.m.

1208
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,671
You know why?
To tell me to fuck off.

1209
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:59,473
Covet not thy neighbor's
wife or husband.

1210
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,274
Thou shalt not steal.

1211
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,711
Thou shalt not use my name in vain.

1212
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:10,554
Thou shalt love God above all.

1213
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,952
Let peace be with you!

1214
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:20,912
Christ indoctrinating
the natives!

1215
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,191
Sailors, catch them.

1216
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:27,029
This man introduced the super-natural
into procreation!

1217
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,276
You can't deny that
the Sermon of the Mount...

1218
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,433
...was just a provocation.
It made way for the Roman Empire.

1219
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,957
You can't deny your relations
with Pontius Pilate.

1220
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,795
They were all interested
in the olive oil monopoly.

1221
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,036
I only wanted goodness!

1222
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,232
Then explain Matthew 5,
Verse 35:

1223
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,471
"Harmonize quickly..."

1224
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,711
"...before he puts you in prison."

1225
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,197
I taught: "If someone slaps your cheek...

1226
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,515
...offer the other."

1227
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,400
In political language,
that means:

1228
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,957
If the Romans take Judea,
give them Galilee too!

1229
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:04,471
At the Gethsemane meeting
when a self defense group...

1230
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,028
...led by Peter...

1231
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,595
...tore off the ear of
the pig who arrested you...

1232
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,069
...you put it back in place.

1233
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,554
- You!
- You!

1234
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,116
Religion isn't even madness,
it's a con game.

1235
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,114
Not this!

1236
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,351
Cut the magic.

1237
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,838
Idiotic magic. Out of style...

1238
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,276
You have to create
through homosexuality...

1239
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,438
...friendships and vigorous relationships.

1240
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,951
Impossible. Between the cock
and the asshole...

1241
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,277
...they've erected a wall.

1242
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,639
We've captured the fiancée
of the unknown soldier!

1243
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:53,077
A great catch! Kneel.

1244
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,275
I wouldn't fuck you for anything.

1245
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,116
I can wait. This is hard
as a rock, take her!

1246
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,793
And who is this little bourgeoise?

1247
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,319
Lil' Mariana.

1248
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,112
- Age?
- 20

1249
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,351
What's your biggest defect?

1250
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:12,908
Caprice.

1251
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,794
What should we teach our kids?

1252
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,033
Religious ideas.

1253
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,634
What's your biggest goal?

1254
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,871
To own a convertible.

1255
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,793
What leads a country to ruin?

1256
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,388
Revolution.

1257
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,312
What do you want to be?

1258
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,918
An envied woman...

1259
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,760
What's your favorite pastime?

1260
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,035
Dancing.

1261
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:35,952
What's jealousy?

1262
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,675
Without it, there's no love.

1263
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,472
What bothers you most?

1264
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,672
To have to work.

1265
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,471
There. The transformation
of sweat into cocktail.

1266
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,148
Christ, at least,
was the son of a mother.

1267
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,511
Yes, because the Holy Ghost
is the tribal prick.

1268
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,632
Here we'll build socialism.

1269
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,831
Contests of laying hens...

1270
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,071
...heated stables, daily work...

1271
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,960
...in the springtime snow
and summer's heat.

1272
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,669
Neither love for one's country nor God...

1273
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,472
...nor honest hypocrisy...

1274
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,711
...but organized flocks...

1275
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,158
...the tractor,
the pathetic collective milk skimmer...

1276
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,030
...the end of magic.

1277
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,954
Without mystery...

1278
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,470
...nothing happens,
without magic, without cheating...

1279
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,795
Long live matriarchy.

1280
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,355
Woman giving orders and fucking man.

1281
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,558
The dogma of the immaculate revolution
is proclaimed.

1282
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,758
We'll erect here
the society of desire.

1283
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,155
The hollow cock!

1284
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,512
Fuck him! Rip his cock off!

1285
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,831
Calm down, let's talk.

1286
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,351
Not with your teeth!

1287
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,794
We'll start the
"Caraiba" Revolution.

1288
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,991
Bigger than the French...

1289
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:06,437
...Bolshevist and Surrealist
revolutions combined.

1290
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,038
Go fuck yourselves,
you shithead revolutionaries.
