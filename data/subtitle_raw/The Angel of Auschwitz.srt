2
00:04:57,945 --> 00:04:59,465
Josef, what are you doing?

3
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:02,185
- I want to protect myself.
- From what?

4
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,745
I don't know what exactly.

5
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:08,985
If you do not know what you are doing,
take your hand away, you look a fool.

6
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:11,345
There is diseases out there.

7
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:14,505
Who told you that?

8
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,665
I can smell it in the air.

9
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:21,865
Only disease is the smell of those

10
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,185
who do not conform to our chosen society.

11
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,025
Take it away.

12
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,305
Well, if there is a disease,

13
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:31,985
maybe I can help them.

14
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:37,705
There are some things you cannot control.

15
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:40,825
I won't ask again.

16
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,225
Hello, Sylwia.

17
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,145
Hello, Sylwia.

18
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,905
Oh.

19
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,665
Shh.

20
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:39,145
Mother, you are an inspiration to me.

21
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,065
A giver of life.

22
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:43,905
What's wrong?

23
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:48,065
God is a giver of life.

24
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:50,425
And I am merely an assistant.

25
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,065
I cannot be responsible

26
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,705
for the achievement
of the mothers who give birth.

27
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:58,865
Come.

28
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,305
Let me show you something.

29
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:21,585
Life. We often forget that life

30
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:23,865
from birth needs nurturing.

31
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:27,505
Consistent care, from birth until death.

32
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:31,225
The Lord gives us the opportunity,

33
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:35,065
the start, the tools
to nurture future lives.

34
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,625
We must care for not only the poor,
sick and weak.

35
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:42,825
Each life without care

36
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:46,225
can become poor, sick and weak.

37
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:50,745
What I do is just a small role
at the beginning.

38
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:03,905
The stone entered the water,
it's the beginning.

39
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,665
Creator of the energy to make the ripples.

40
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,425
I assisted the beginning.

41
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:14,585
The ripples are life itself,

42
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:17,105
of which I have no control.

43
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:21,105
The stone, I had no part in its creation

44
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,865
and the ripples are beyond my control.

45
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,625
The Lord creates the stone.

46
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,265
And the Lord determines

47
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:32,585
the duration of the ripples.

48
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:36,145
It cannot last forever.

49
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,305
Why another stone?

50
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,905
We are the ripples. Are you?

51
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:56,265
Let's enjoy you.

52
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:11,505
Get it out. That's fine.

53
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,945
You can make as much noise as you wish.

54
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,145
The baby will be with you very soon.

55
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:10,865
It's time.

56
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:23,865
That's it. That's right.

57
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:26,265
Almost over. Now, push.

58
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,105
Now my dear, one small push.

59
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:54,985
It's the placental expulsion.

60
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,225
So?

61
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:23,585
Twins.

62
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:25,265
Twins?

63
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:29,465
Bring me as many twins as you can.

64
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:30,825
Why twins?

65
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:34,665
If they are not blond
and blue-eyed, or twins...

66
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:37,425
you drown them.

67
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,505
Your role of midwife...

68
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:49,145
has changed.

69
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:50,505
How so?

70
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:53,745
I need you to help me with something else.

71
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:55,065
Just as important.

72
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:57,745
More important, in fact.

73
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,545
You are here for your crimes

74
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,905
but... not for your ethnicity.

75
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,385
Child killing?

76
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:13,425
- How many abortions...
- I...

77
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,465
It's OK.

78
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:17,585
We all make mistakes.

79
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,465
However, we have to learn from them.

80
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:22,025
This is why I need you.

81
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:25,505
You taught yourself how to kill a child.

82
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,785
That makes us have a similar interest.

83
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:32,545
Expect my children are Jews and Gypsies.

84
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:34,825
You like killing children?

85
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,745
For research, of course.

86
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,865
I get to make my mistakes
and learn from them.

87
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:42,545
Especially on these Jews.
We have many to choose from.

88
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,545
For fun? No.

89
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:48,025
But to help the future of Germany

90
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,705
and to ensure good health

91
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:52,305
for the future generations
of the thousand-year Reich,

92
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:55,385
I would do... anything.

93
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:57,865
And so must you.

94
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:01,625
But I'm a midwife?

95
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,625
A good midwife

96
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:09,665
with many years of experience.

97
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,705
Many of which, mostly successful.

98
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,505
Obviously, the conditions here
do not help and...

99
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:23,065
I will, of course, do as you say.

100
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:26,385
I have no right to disagree
with any of your orders.

101
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:30,865
- I am just a midwife.
- Not anymore!

102
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,305
Too afraid to look at me?

103
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:40,505
You will have to look at God one day

104
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,545
and explain why you are a child killer.

105
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,785
Medical research

106
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:48,905
will be my answer.

107
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:51,745
And your answer will be?

108
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,265
Can I ask why I was taken
from my midwife duties?

109
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:20,345
41335, Stanisława Leszczyńska.

110
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:22,865
A Catholic?

111
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:17,105
- Occupation?
- Dressmaker.

112
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:21,225
Dressmakers.

113
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:27,105
- Occupation?
- Dressmaker.

114
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:01,225
Bless us, O Lord, for these dying gifts.

115
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,945
Which we are about to receive

116
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,385
through thy bounty.

117
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,145
Through Christ, our Lord.

118
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:11,345
Amen.

119
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:00,865
She should be dead.

120
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,545
She has lied about her occupation

121
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:08,345
but has come to us with the offer
and honesty of her true occupation.

122
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,985
She is a midwife and she isn't a Jew.

123
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,745
Hail Mary, full of grace.

124
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,425
The Lord is with thee.

125
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,265
Blessed art thou among women.

126
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:47,665
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

127
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:53,665
Holy Mary, mother of God.

128
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:55,745
Pray for our sinners.

129
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:59,185
Now and at the hour of our death.

130
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:01,705
Amen.

131
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,265
She is highly accomplished.

132
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:20,105
She will do her duties
and you will do yours.

133
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,225
Duties?

134
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,625
Drown the offspring of these parasites.

135
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:27,265
Being rid of them early is the only way

136
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:29,425
to cut these leeches from our lives.

137
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:32,105
From existence.

138
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:37,425
Once I have,
where do you want me to put them?

139
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:40,665
Do you want me to bring them to you?

140
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,585
Most certainly not!

141
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,905
You will need some help, too.

142
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,865
Who do you have in mind?

143
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:48,905
Sister Pfani.

144
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:50,465
She is a strong woman.

145
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:52,545
Most prostitutes are.

146
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,865
But, doctor, I am still unsure.

147
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:59,505
Where do you want the children to go?

148
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,665
After we have killed them?

149
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:04,145
Feed them to the dogs or the rats.

150
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,385
I don't care.

151
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:40,185
Typhus will kill us
before the SS will at this rate.

152
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:53,585
You think I'm a sinner?

153
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,345
What I think has no relevance here.

154
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:03,025
If the world needs to be clean
of the Jews,

155
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:04,745
then so be it.

156
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:06,905
Amen.

157
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,225
27893.

158
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:19,665
Remove this. Get me another.

159
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:28,625
No prayers today, my dear?

160
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:31,985
I gave up praying a while ago.

161
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,505
And has that made a difference
to your life?

162
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:40,225
Just as much difference as praying did.

163
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:45,665
Faith is all that will
get us through this.

164
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:48,705
Tell that to my family.

165
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:51,425
Taken.

166
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:54,065
All of them.

167
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:56,825
And they left you all alone?

168
00:24:57,865 --> 00:24:58,825
Yes.

169
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:02,825
So that means
even more reason to pray, no?

170
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,465
There comes a time

171
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:09,945
when your mind can't accept hope
and optimism.

172
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:13,825
We need to fight through this.

173
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,865
We need to work together.

174
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:17,945
You're a stranger.

175
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:25,105
Strangers are those
who want to separate us.

176
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:27,785
Our family

177
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:30,785
are those who sit in the ark together.

178
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:34,625
Ark? This is slaughter.

179
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:52,905
What is this?

180
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,545
My paperwork.

181
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:10,305
And the 15 different names?

182
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:11,905
You help these pigs?

183
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:13,465
Why?

184
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:17,145
You know that falsification of documents
is against the Third Reich.

185
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:19,225
And punishment is death for treason.

186
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:27,385
You want to help the Jews?

187
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:28,905
I will allow you to.

188
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,265
You will travel with them on the train.

189
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:33,545
The train?

190
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:36,225
Your new home.

191
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,145
Regular work.

192
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:42,505
Food and plenty of opportunities
to help the Jews.

193
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:44,745
But I have a family.

194
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:47,225
Your family too.

195
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:25,345
It's OK.

196
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:32,545
Nice?

197
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:35,545
Good. Good.

198
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:58,105
These women need these for their babies.

199
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,585
But they also need the bread.

200
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,465
We all need bread.

201
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,705
It's OK, my dear.

202
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,545
We're all hungry here.

203
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:12,985
I'm sure it will be met with need
rather than greed.

204
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:15,185
Thank you.

205
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:27,665
God bless you.

206
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:53,585
I...

207
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,105
killed... my...

208
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:01,185
child.

209
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:06,785
My...

210
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,985
intention...

211
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:12,585
was not...

212
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,425
to kill... my...

213
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:18,865
child.

214
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:11,745
Can you pass the water, please?

215
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:48,785
Dr Mengele is waiting.

216
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,865
Run along. Fetch the water.

217
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:55,225
Why?

218
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,425
I'm sorry.

219
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,705
Shh. Rest.

220
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:38,625
You will be with your child very soon.

221
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,145
You see.

222
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:46,825
We remove a piece of the skin on the back,

223
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:50,265
the wrists and the back of the calf muscle

224
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:52,225
on both subjects.

225
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,505
Then we simply attach them to each other

226
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:57,105
back to back.

227
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,145
Attach them?

228
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:01,985
But surely this...
they will reject each other?

229
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:04,225
In theory, yes.

230
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:08,785
But if twins are identical
from the same egg,

231
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:11,905
mono twins can be conjoined in the womb,

232
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,745
so why not outside the womb?

233
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:17,185
I... What about infection?

234
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:20,865
This will not
allow you to test this theory

235
00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:23,265
and it will make it difficult to rule out

236
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:26,345
whether it is rejection or infection.

237
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:28,745
You are absolutely right.

238
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:31,225
But we have quite a few.

239
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,825
It's me or typhus. So, why waste them?

240
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:36,945
No, it is very true.

241
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,865
17854.

242
00:34:41,185 --> 00:34:42,905
Bring me the twin boys.

243
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:45,385
648322

244
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:47,945
and 648323.

245
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:00,585
You refuse an order from me?

246
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:01,665
No, Artz Mengele.

247
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:05,585
Look at me!

248
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:10,265
36543.

249
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:16,785
Bring me 20 children
and line them up outside.

250
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:18,545
Yes, Dr Mengele.

251
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:24,905
I know. I know.

252
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,785
You want to save your people.

253
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,625
You wish for liberation

254
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,305
and freedom.

255
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:36,305
Well, I am afraid to tell you

256
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,585
that Germany rules the world

257
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:41,065
and will do for at least a thousand years.

258
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:44,345
When I give an order

259
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:46,785
you must follow.

260
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:50,785
The children, you...

261
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:55,265
personally are responsible
for their death now.

262
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:59,945
20 children for your defiance.

263
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:03,545
But they would have died anyway,

264
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,625
so don't feel too bad about it
and they won't feel a thing.

265
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:09,345
A simple injection to the heart.

266
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:11,185
Now...

267
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:13,225
I will try again.

268
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,545
OK?

269
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:19,425
Get me the twin boys.

270
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:22,865
Yes, Artz Mengele!

271
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:27,705
I need your help.

272
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:32,425
The milk. There is not enough.

273
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:37,345
The baby will need more
when Klara returns from sick bay.

274
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,065
My dear.

275
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,585
And I have been drying this on my back.
Just like you told me.

276
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:47,425
My dear, listen to me.

277
00:36:48,865 --> 00:36:51,105
May I have another piece of bread?

278
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:53,545
But I must have another diaper.

279
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:57,705
Eat the bread.

280
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,425
It is for the baby.

281
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:06,065
The baby is with the Lord.

282
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:08,505
But Klara said...

283
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:11,505
Klara is untruthful, not to be trusted.

284
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:17,065
She is with the Lord now.

285
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:37,865
You have been given the responsibility
of midwife here.

286
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:40,745
And I understand your deliveries are many?

287
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,905
In order to monitor the survival rate

288
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:49,105
and to test the resilience
of mothers and children,

289
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:52,185
for the purposes of future research,

290
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,465
can you please tell me how many

291
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:58,545
of your 1,800 deliveries were stillborn?

292
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:01,545
Come along.

293
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:03,505
How many?

294
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:07,705
None.

295
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,105
All the children were born alive and well.

296
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:13,465
Your delinquent behavior astounds me.

297
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:18,905
You were ordered to register
all births as stillborn,

298
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:20,705
yet I see from this list...

299
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:25,465
that all the children were born alive.

300
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,825
You may be a good midwife
but I do assure you,

301
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:33,745
you won't last very long here
if you persist like this.

302
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:38,985
I witness many atrocities here.

303
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:42,985
Life tends to find a way.

304
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,905
Even under the conditions,

305
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,505
the life starts.

306
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:50,785
No different from an animal in the wild.

307
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:54,545
Although a wild animal
can forage for food,

308
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,025
a mother cannot.

309
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,985
I understand that you would like for me

310
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:09,745
to declare the baby dead once born.

311
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:13,385
But if they are alive...

312
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,065
I will not.

313
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:20,345
OK.

314
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:24,105
Let's begin at the beginning.

315
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:27,305
I'm intrigued by your... research.

316
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:29,345
My research is merely fact.

317
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:31,425
None of the children were born still

318
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,905
and all the mothers
also survived the birth.

319
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:38,545
One thousand eight hundred and twenty four

320
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:41,865
of my patients and their children
all survived...

321
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:44,745
the birth, that is.

322
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:48,345
The intervention of the SS to those lives

323
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:51,345
after that, I cannot say.

324
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,345
It's impossible.

325
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:57,305
Even the finest German physician

326
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:59,985
could not claim such a success rate.

327
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,945
The mothers' suffering is beyond belief.

328
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,505
The children are drowned in the...

329
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:14,345
I see that many of your patients

330
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:17,625
are marked as suffering
from the influenza virus.

331
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,025
Surely it's typhus?

332
00:40:22,105 --> 00:40:22,905
No.

333
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:26,825
Although my midwife title
stays my profession,

334
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:29,265
it does not state my experience.

335
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,185
These women just have the flu.

336
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:36,905
You do understand the consequences
of lying, don't you?

337
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,465
I understand.

338
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:41,985
Good.

339
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:45,745
These people...

340
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:49,825
it is essential that they are eliminated.

341
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:52,825
To prevent the spread
of this foul disease.

342
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:57,025
It's all very confusing.

343
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:58,185
What is?

344
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:00,105
The process.

345
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,625
To avoid cross-contamination.

346
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:05,105
But to work everyone to death.

347
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:11,945
Dr Mengele has a very keen interest
in certain children.

348
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:13,265
Twins.

349
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:17,705
We would appreciate it
if you would notify us of such births.

350
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:21,385
Also all children with blond hair
or blue eyes.

351
00:41:22,385 --> 00:41:23,985
For Germanization.

352
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:26,625
Ahh, you see.

353
00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:30,225
Those can be saved.

354
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:51,665
Miss Janina.

355
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:57,625
I cannot fathom
what I have just been informed of.

356
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:00,545
I'm sure nothing you are going to say
will surprise me but...

357
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:02,625
you have my attention.

358
00:42:02,705 --> 00:42:04,105
Where to start.

359
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:06,425
Doesn't the fact that we are here
surprise you?

360
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:10,345
This is beyond anything
of our imagination.

361
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:13,225
This is not a war of countries.

362
00:42:13,785 --> 00:42:15,785
This is a war against humanity.

363
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:17,225
Walk with me.

364
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:24,505
This is more safe than inside.

365
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,785
Do you think
we're safer out here, in the open?

366
00:42:26,865 --> 00:42:30,265
I would rather risk being caught outside
by an SS officer

367
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:32,385
than anyone hearing of the atrocities

368
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:35,785
that are being conducted on them
that lay dying only feet away from us.

369
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:39,425
You think I'm not aware of the disease?

370
00:42:39,505 --> 00:42:42,225
Of the famine? Of the gas,
Mrs Leszczyńska?

371
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:45,865
This entire place has no room.

372
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:48,825
Stop for a moment and smell the air.

373
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:52,505
Take it in. Tell me, what is it?

374
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:55,425
Death.

375
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:58,505
Death is what we know.
Evil is what is coming.

376
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:00,505
Evil is already here.

377
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:02,505
It has been from the beginning.

378
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:07,265
I know this entire place is more evil than

379
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:10,385
anything in all of my years
I could have ever imagined.

380
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:14,545
They aren't just killing the children.

381
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,265
They're experimenting on them.

382
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:17,865
Selecting twins.

383
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,545
I hear experimentation,

384
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,505
although I cannot be sure of this.

385
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:27,185
The risk of not assuming is too high
for innocent lives to be wasted.

386
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,025
Along with this, I have been ordered

387
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:33,185
to deliver all children with blond hair
and blue eyes

388
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:34,665
directly to the superior.

389
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:37,145
A puzzle that cannot be solved.

390
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:40,105
Hitler is of small build,

391
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:41,825
dark hair, dark eyes

392
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:44,425
and wants to create a race
opposite himself?

393
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:46,785
I thought you were going to mention
the rise in typhus.

394
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,025
This is a serious issue
that is affecting the whole camp.

395
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:53,785
To liquidize anyone
who has a typhoid virus.

396
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,505
They could recover.

397
00:43:55,585 --> 00:43:57,625
I am willing to disobey

398
00:43:57,705 --> 00:44:01,025
in the hope that we can save
as many lives as we possibly can.

399
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,905
But how can you guarantee that disease
will not spread further?

400
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:05,345
We do not have medicine.

401
00:44:06,345 --> 00:44:08,065
Are you suggesting that we kill

402
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,025
our future generation of mothers
out of laziness

403
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:12,865
just in case it spreads?

404
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:14,665
No.

405
00:44:14,745 --> 00:44:17,065
But to risk the lives of everyone else.

406
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:24,065
The sick are in our hands.

407
00:44:25,785 --> 00:44:29,265
The innocent children.
The twins. The fair.

408
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:31,585
What do you suggest we do to help?

409
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:33,385
Do we not have any power?

410
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:35,585
Any say?

411
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:47,145
Why did you bring me here?

412
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:50,225
To make you aware that we are in charge

413
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:52,625
of ensuring that the future mothers

414
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:55,465
who are sick are our responsibility.

415
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:58,865
If we can continue to help every mother
survive their flu,

416
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,985
safely deliver their children

417
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,985
and make sure every child
delivered is delivered alive,

418
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:07,545
we live in hope that these children

419
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,305
can live a long, happy and Nazi-free life.

420
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:15,265
If we forget to look for that hope,

421
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:19,825
we may as well forget our sanity.

422
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,705
I am sorry, Stanislawa.

423
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:26,585
Sorry for what?

424
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,705
Sorry that...

425
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:31,985
The realization of this
has only just been delivered to you.

426
00:45:32,585 --> 00:45:34,225
You know about this?

427
00:45:34,305 --> 00:45:37,585
I'm a doctor, you're a midwife.

428
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:41,465
You are the angel of life.

429
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:44,545
Mengele, the angel of death.

430
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:47,785
Of course, there is a group resistance
in here.

431
00:45:48,865 --> 00:45:51,065
And when it is possible, they will resist.

432
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:55,585
Too soon... they will die.

433
00:45:56,785 --> 00:45:57,785
Too late...

434
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,425
they will die.

435
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:02,865
We have no power.

436
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:06,345
We have no choice but...

437
00:46:07,785 --> 00:46:09,345
to do our duty and...

438
00:46:10,425 --> 00:46:12,305
deal with this
in the best way that we can.

439
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:16,745
Stanislawa.

440
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:19,905
You work tirelessly day and night.

441
00:46:20,785 --> 00:46:23,225
You too need to rest or you will not

442
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:25,545
be fit enough to care for these women
and children.

443
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,545
You are saving two at a time.

444
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:31,985
Without you...

445
00:46:33,785 --> 00:46:35,065
they would die.

446
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:40,185
Especially if Sister Klara took control
of delivering the babies again.

447
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:47,465
Can I ask you something?

448
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,305
Of course.

449
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:53,385
Do you think this will ever end?

450
00:46:56,825 --> 00:46:57,785
It must.

451
00:46:58,625 --> 00:46:59,505
And it will.

452
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:03,665
One way or another we...

453
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:05,905
we will be free from this place.

454
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:10,225
We are the survivors

455
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:14,305
and whether we live or die...

456
00:47:16,825 --> 00:47:18,625
we will have helped others to survive.

457
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:23,865
And they in turn will help out others.

458
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:27,745
So you see all we need to do is...

459
00:47:29,465 --> 00:47:31,585
continue with our work,

460
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:33,585
whatever Mengele is doing.

461
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:37,345
We have no control.

462
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:43,185
Are you OK?

463
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:45,785
Of course.

464
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:49,305
I'm tired but I'm fine.

465
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,105
Take care of yourself.

466
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:58,185
We need you.

467
00:48:37,345 --> 00:48:38,705
How are you doing today?

468
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,705
Issue with...

469
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:50,065
voice box.

470
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:52,545
Voice box.

471
00:48:53,545 --> 00:48:54,385
He speaks!

472
00:48:55,385 --> 00:48:57,865
How are you feeling
about the surgery today?

473
00:48:58,425 --> 00:49:00,265
What are you going to do to me?

474
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,265
Well, a wise man once said

475
00:49:04,905 --> 00:49:07,505
that curiosity killed the cat.

476
00:49:08,385 --> 00:49:12,185
Just as well I'm not working with felines,
isn't it?

477
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,425
Why?

478
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:23,985
Well, well, well.

479
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:28,465
You feel you are entitled
to ask me such a question?

480
00:49:29,145 --> 00:49:30,625
No, Dr Mengele.

481
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:34,545
Farming.

482
00:49:42,425 --> 00:49:46,105
My father. A hobby
that went on to be big business

483
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:48,145
producing farm machinery in Germany.

484
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:51,905
However, farming was not the fascination.

485
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:54,505
Medicine was my focus.

486
00:49:55,185 --> 00:49:58,865
To assess and deliver
extraordinary results.

487
00:49:59,905 --> 00:50:01,945
University taught me the basics.

488
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:05,585
Everything that a young medical student
would desire to know.

489
00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:08,745
Human genetics.

490
00:50:08,825 --> 00:50:10,505
They are most baffling.

491
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:14,505
Constantly changing factors to discover.

492
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:18,265
I served my time.
For the Nazi Party, of course.

493
00:50:19,065 --> 00:50:20,505
Even after I was wounded,

494
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:23,385
I remained true to my leader
and my people.

495
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:26,225
My goal has always been

496
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:28,745
to increase the world's knowledge

497
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,745
on the biggest mystery
we have yet to solve.

498
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:35,705
The human race.

499
00:50:37,145 --> 00:50:38,185
Why we get sick.

500
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:41,185
Why we dysfunction.

501
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:43,505
Why we die.

502
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:47,705
And why the Jews

503
00:50:47,785 --> 00:50:50,065
are such a disability to the world.

504
00:50:51,065 --> 00:50:52,545
To help the imperfect.

505
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:56,305
To create a race of people

506
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:58,945
who do not fear for their imminent death

507
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:02,505
by natural selection.

508
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:16,185
Your blood is beautiful...

509
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:19,665
but wasted.

510
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:32,145
Dr Mengele, may I ask you
why you are putting the subject to sleep?

511
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:37,385
If I am to make any use of a fail first

512
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:40,865
I must make sure
that the second is not far behind.

513
00:51:41,425 --> 00:51:44,785
The results can be used
accurately this way.

514
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,585
So, what would you like me
to do with them?

515
00:51:50,665 --> 00:51:53,225
Stop the heart of this little one.

516
00:51:53,745 --> 00:51:57,385
Dissect and label the parts
individually for measurements.

517
00:51:57,905 --> 00:52:00,265
We shall begin testing
while the blood is still warm.

518
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:04,465
The measurements of the organs
is of great interest to me.

519
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:07,865
You need to quieten down.

520
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:10,585
No, no.

521
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:14,425
You don't understand
the pain I am feeling right now.

522
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:17,065
You will stop this selfishness at once!

523
00:52:17,145 --> 00:52:19,905
Screaming is only going to bring attention

524
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:22,865
and attention is not what you
or your baby needs right now.

525
00:52:22,945 --> 00:52:25,185
You need to move to the furnace.

526
00:52:25,265 --> 00:52:28,265
He is coming. I cannot move.

527
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,825
You are one of the lucky ones.

528
00:52:30,905 --> 00:52:33,865
The fire in the furnace only burns
a few times a year.

529
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:37,025
Most of the women around you

530
00:52:37,105 --> 00:52:39,385
have dealt with the cold icy conditions

531
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:41,465
this camp enjoys to torture us with.

532
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,545
So, for you and your baby,

533
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:45,905
let's move.

534
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:49,865
He's coming.

535
00:52:52,465 --> 00:52:55,025
Slowly.

536
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,305
Slowly.

537
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:57,465
That's it.

538
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:09,505
I need you to breath.

539
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:17,225
What's wrong?

540
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:20,385
You're suffering from preeclampsia.

541
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:22,785
The blood pressure is too high.

542
00:53:23,665 --> 00:53:27,305
If we don't deliver this baby right now,
you and your baby are both at risk.

543
00:53:27,385 --> 00:53:30,145
The next contraction, I need you to push.

544
00:53:30,225 --> 00:53:32,825
Just take a nice deep...

545
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:34,665
That's it, keep pushing!

546
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:57,665
Every life is as precious as the next.

547
00:53:58,185 --> 00:54:01,985
I cannot guarantee that life
will last longer than this moment.

548
00:54:02,945 --> 00:54:05,825
But if I can bring a mother
and her child together

549
00:54:06,345 --> 00:54:08,145
for any amount of time,

550
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:10,065
then I have done my duties.

551
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:12,065
Keep her safe.

552
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:13,705
Keep her hidden.

553
00:54:14,225 --> 00:54:15,305
Keep her alive.

554
00:55:03,185 --> 00:55:04,185
I will go.

555
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,865
You feed the dogs.

556
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:30,585
Hello, sir.

557
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:33,025
Now, before we start,

558
00:55:33,465 --> 00:55:34,825
you know what you paid for?

559
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:37,865
All look. No touch.

560
00:55:38,665 --> 00:55:40,065
Or big man finds out.

561
00:55:41,345 --> 00:55:43,545
And we don't want that happening,
do we now?

562
00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:48,865
I hear you have package for me?

563
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:53,225
It's a shame I won't be able
to see what's inside.

564
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:58,465
For a price.

565
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:13,585
Double it.

566
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,065
And you can do whatever you like.

567
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:20,105
I want you to dance.

568
00:56:22,305 --> 00:56:23,825
And I haven't got all day.

569
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:29,705
You are a dancer, correct?

570
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:33,625
So dance.

571
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:18,465
Go.

572
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:29,425
We should be ready for phase two.

573
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:36,465
It is time.

574
00:57:38,185 --> 00:57:39,945
Record the time of removal.

575
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:41,945
21:47.

576
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:45,385
Which will make it
50 minutes in immersion.

577
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:46,665
Still alive.

578
00:57:47,305 --> 00:57:48,105
Just.

579
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:52,345
- How long was the last subject?
- 57 minutes.

580
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,985
So we have already proven

581
00:57:57,065 --> 00:58:00,105
that the body cannot handle
the icy temperature

582
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,705
beyond the extra seven minutes.

583
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:06,225
Where there is the differential
of the subject, Herr doctor.

584
00:58:07,185 --> 00:58:10,505
Which is why we must repeat this
to get the most accurate result.

585
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:14,025
At least with this patient alive,

586
00:58:14,105 --> 00:58:18,105
we will be able to discover
how to treat someone with hypothermia.

587
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:19,545
Intriguing.

588
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:22,225
Boiling water will warm him up.

589
00:58:29,825 --> 00:58:31,385
Help us.

590
00:58:33,185 --> 00:58:35,825
You do need help. I agree.

591
00:58:43,785 --> 00:58:45,745
It's because you are a filthy Jew.

592
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:54,225
Spotted fever in your blood stream.

593
00:58:59,505 --> 00:59:02,265
You must all think that I am evil.

594
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:06,025
That I am doing this for sole enjoyment.

595
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:10,305
If I can use your results

596
00:59:10,385 --> 00:59:12,825
in finding a way to defeat
the typhus disease,

597
00:59:12,905 --> 00:59:14,945
some of you may live
to see the end of it.

598
00:59:15,025 --> 00:59:16,465
But if they die?

599
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,985
Then we will try again
with new test subjects.

600
00:59:20,065 --> 00:59:21,745
- If you are sure...
- Please!

601
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:23,705
Don't question me again, doctor.

602
00:59:24,585 --> 00:59:26,665
I wouldn't choose to challenge
your intelligence

603
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:28,625
and I would appreciate the same in return.

604
01:00:19,425 --> 01:00:20,425
Kill her.

605
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:25,505
What is your purpose?

606
01:00:25,585 --> 01:00:27,345
I need no purpose.

607
01:00:27,945 --> 01:00:30,065
I am in charge of your decisions.

608
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:32,225
Kill her.

609
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:40,345
How dare you suggest I kill this woman!

610
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:42,385
She can be saved.

611
01:00:48,585 --> 01:00:50,145
Who do you think you are?

612
01:00:51,505 --> 01:00:53,865
You realize why they made you Kapo?

613
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:55,425
Why you're in charge?

614
01:00:56,505 --> 01:00:59,705
Because I can see what is right
and what is wrong.

615
01:01:00,305 --> 01:01:02,785
Therefore my decision-making is accurate

616
01:01:02,865 --> 01:01:03,985
and efficient.

617
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:06,465
You are delusional.

618
01:01:06,985 --> 01:01:11,185
They chose you because you
are an unprofessional criminal.

619
01:01:11,265 --> 01:01:14,825
Why waste someone who lacks a conscience
on delivering children

620
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:17,585
when they can use you to murder

621
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:19,305
without a second thought.

622
01:01:20,345 --> 01:01:22,865
What makes you so competent
in killing an infant?

623
01:01:28,265 --> 01:01:29,465
Your hesitation

624
01:01:29,545 --> 01:01:32,505
tells me you might actually have something
pumping in there.

625
01:01:32,585 --> 01:01:34,225
I do what I have to do.

626
01:01:34,305 --> 01:01:35,745
You never have to kill a child!

627
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,465
I am in charge. It's my job.

628
01:01:39,745 --> 01:01:41,785
If you keep retaliating like that,

629
01:01:42,585 --> 01:01:45,305
it will not just be infants
that I'm killing.

630
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:49,345
It's your job because most are forced
into leadership in this camp.

631
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:52,265
Now you get on with your day

632
01:01:52,345 --> 01:01:55,105
and let me help this poor women
deliver her child.

633
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:24,345
I'm suggesting we follow up the experiment
with female barracks.

634
01:02:24,905 --> 01:02:26,745
- Maternity?
- Yeah.

635
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:28,505
They're diseased.

636
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:31,745
Not only with dysentery and typhus
but with children.

637
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:33,705
I may need some of those children.

638
01:02:33,785 --> 01:02:34,745
Correct.

639
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:38,385
With the information similar to that
in the latrines

640
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:39,985
but from pregnant women.

641
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:45,465
We may push our research
in further direction.

642
01:02:46,425 --> 01:02:49,105
For now, I keep them alive.

643
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:51,305
I'm finding it...

644
01:02:51,385 --> 01:02:54,425
entertaining watching the Catholic
save the day.

645
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:56,745
What an earth are you doing in here?

646
01:02:59,185 --> 01:03:01,105
You need to come to the female barracks.

647
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:13,545
- Leave her alone.
- Her number was called.

648
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:16,665
She's done nothing to you!
Get off her!

649
01:03:22,425 --> 01:03:25,865
Her number was called
moments after she gave birth.

650
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:27,025
And?

651
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:38,865
And it is not in good standing
for a new mother and her offspring

652
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:42,105
to be among all this stress
so soon after the birth.

653
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:44,865
If I may...

654
01:03:44,945 --> 01:03:46,265
I shall test their health

655
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:49,145
to ensure the children shall survive.

656
01:03:51,145 --> 01:03:52,465
Her number was called?

657
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:57,265
Then take them both.

658
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:46,785
Do you know how old you are?

659
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:52,705
Where are you from?

660
01:04:55,505 --> 01:04:57,505
The world isn't yet perfect.

661
01:04:58,425 --> 01:04:59,545
It can be.

662
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:06,265
You are a strong one.

663
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:14,305
What if it's dysentery?

664
01:05:16,065 --> 01:05:17,585
Then you will fight it,

665
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:20,425
as all these women have for the terror.

666
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:22,585
The disease.

667
01:05:31,825 --> 01:05:33,105
What are your symptoms?

668
01:05:33,905 --> 01:05:34,945
Stomach cramp.

669
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:39,105
Diarrhea, blood.

670
01:05:48,665 --> 01:05:49,865
Then you shall rest.

671
01:05:52,825 --> 01:05:55,305
I'm lifting you from any duties

672
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:56,785
for a while.

673
01:06:41,145 --> 01:06:42,585
Hmm, yeah. Right.

674
01:06:44,305 --> 01:06:46,785
Your condition seems
a little more serious.

675
01:06:48,865 --> 01:06:50,545
Ahh, and you're a doctor.

676
01:06:52,025 --> 01:06:55,585
Yes, flu, right. You already told me.

677
01:06:57,505 --> 01:07:00,265
Only your desperation tells me otherwise.

678
01:07:00,345 --> 01:07:01,465
If I may?

679
01:07:02,425 --> 01:07:03,305
Proceed.

680
01:07:03,865 --> 01:07:05,465
I care as much as you do.

681
01:07:07,265 --> 01:07:09,785
Why would I want the babies I deliver

682
01:07:09,865 --> 01:07:11,545
to be exposed to illness?

683
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:13,345
Continue.

684
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:17,145
This woman is a little sick.

685
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,025
But what you're forgetting

686
01:07:19,105 --> 01:07:22,065
is that she's also carrying
an eight-month-old child.

687
01:07:23,225 --> 01:07:26,425
You will never know the sensations,

688
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:28,385
especially in these conditions.

689
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:32,385
Flu as well?

690
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,105
She is in recovery.

691
01:07:34,585 --> 01:07:36,305
The flu has already left her system.

692
01:07:37,665 --> 01:07:40,145
A nice cold shower
will bring you back to life.

693
01:07:40,225 --> 01:07:42,385
I will bring her back to life.

694
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:44,705
Up and around in no time.

695
01:07:54,305 --> 01:07:55,105
Very well.

696
01:07:57,785 --> 01:07:58,625
Flu?

697
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:16,185
Mother. Am I going to die?

698
01:08:17,585 --> 01:08:21,385
The disease nor the evil
will destroy you.

699
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,065
You're a survivor.

700
01:08:40,265 --> 01:08:41,745
Angel of the heart.

701
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:44,825
You are the strength of the future.

702
01:08:45,385 --> 01:08:47,745
And the beauty of past memories.

703
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:50,745
You are the love,

704
01:08:52,025 --> 01:08:52,985
the light

705
01:08:53,665 --> 01:08:55,545
and the hope.

706
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:58,305
You are life's precious gift.

707
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:01,905
An unbelievable miracle.

708
01:09:02,545 --> 01:09:05,745
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy ghost.

709
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:08,985
Amen.

710
01:09:23,545 --> 01:09:24,905
Stanislawa

711
01:09:26,385 --> 01:09:28,305
- Stanislawa.
- I'm fine.

712
01:09:31,065 --> 01:09:33,545
I would like you to lie down
while I go and get a doctor.

713
01:09:34,265 --> 01:09:36,745
I would like to see Dr Janina

714
01:09:36,825 --> 01:09:38,745
regarding an issue with data.

715
01:09:41,025 --> 01:09:41,905
An issue?

716
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:45,185
Easily fixed

717
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,745
by a woman of her intelligence.

718
01:09:50,545 --> 01:09:51,945
I will notify her.

719
01:10:20,785 --> 01:10:22,985
The midwife has requested to see Janina.

720
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:24,545
Why's that?

721
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:28,105
She claims it's something to do with
a data issue and the doctor can fix it.

722
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:29,985
Why not just call Lagaraztem?

723
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:31,305
She didn't give me a...

724
01:10:31,385 --> 01:10:33,305
A chance to what?

725
01:10:33,825 --> 01:10:34,745
Demand?

726
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:36,425
Direct?

727
01:10:37,145 --> 01:10:38,545
You are in charge.

728
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:41,065
No, Klara, you are in charge.

729
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:44,145
Fine. Get Janina.

730
01:10:44,225 --> 01:10:45,625
I'm far too busy.

731
01:10:45,705 --> 01:10:47,145
I'm just a messenger.

732
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:52,225
You're the one that has the control to
bring Janina back to the barrack, not me.

733
01:10:56,865 --> 01:10:59,105
You understand why we do what we do?

734
01:10:59,825 --> 01:11:01,105
Of course.

735
01:11:01,185 --> 01:11:03,985
We are part of a larger scheme

736
01:11:04,785 --> 01:11:06,625
that will make the world better.

737
01:11:07,465 --> 01:11:10,305
A superior version of the one
we have lived in before now.

738
01:11:10,385 --> 01:11:11,145
I know that.

739
01:11:13,105 --> 01:11:14,385
What did you do before?

740
01:11:14,465 --> 01:11:15,865
You know what I did before.

741
01:11:15,945 --> 01:11:18,985
If you're not ashamed, tell me out loud.

742
01:11:20,345 --> 01:11:22,425
I slept with men for money.

743
01:11:23,105 --> 01:11:25,305
And did that make you feel powerful?

744
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:28,785
Yes.

745
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:34,705
The death of an infant is relevant.

746
01:11:35,865 --> 01:11:39,705
It's life. It's destined for diseases.

747
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:44,065
And fatalities, regardless if we kill it
or nature does.

748
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:47,665
We have the power to survive this place.

749
01:11:47,745 --> 01:11:49,185
Don't waste it!

750
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:55,465
Take this to Artz Mengele.

751
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:57,665
And bring Janina.

752
01:12:21,025 --> 01:12:22,185
What's that?

753
01:12:23,185 --> 01:12:24,465
We're being relocated.

754
01:12:26,945 --> 01:12:28,825
Why? What's happening to the house?

755
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:30,825
The Nazis are turning this into a ghetto.

756
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:35,105
Can we stop them from doing that?

757
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:37,585
You know full well we can't.

758
01:12:39,985 --> 01:12:40,865
Pack lightly.

759
01:13:40,265 --> 01:13:41,425
Doctor.

760
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:45,905
My guess is that you didn't just
request me regarding a data issue.

761
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:50,145
Stay down. You need your strength.

762
01:13:52,465 --> 01:13:54,385
You know I would

763
01:13:54,465 --> 01:13:57,185
never have called you away from work

764
01:13:57,785 --> 01:13:59,705
unless I needed to.

765
01:13:59,785 --> 01:14:03,425
Coming from a woman that has delivered
over 2,000 babies alive,

766
01:14:04,585 --> 01:14:06,505
that's actually not so hard to believe.

767
01:14:08,345 --> 01:14:10,385
They rely on me...

768
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:13,945
to make sure they are healthy

769
01:14:14,505 --> 01:14:17,945
and protected from the doctors

770
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:21,705
who claim to look after us here.

771
01:14:22,385 --> 01:14:24,785
To make sure their children

772
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:27,345
are born safely into the world.

773
01:14:28,065 --> 01:14:30,905
I... I am sick.

774
01:14:31,985 --> 01:14:33,745
Who assists you normally?

775
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:35,265
I work alone.

776
01:14:35,945 --> 01:14:39,025
The other two are murderers.

777
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:41,785
- Of the women?
- Of the children.

778
01:14:43,825 --> 01:14:45,865
So what do you need me to do, Stanislawa?

779
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:50,625
I need you to take over

780
01:14:50,705 --> 01:14:54,465
my duties until I am well again.

781
01:14:54,945 --> 01:14:57,625
And does that include lying to the SS?

782
01:14:59,825 --> 01:15:01,905
Do you think I would

783
01:15:01,985 --> 01:15:04,225
have been as successful in here

784
01:15:04,985 --> 01:15:08,625
if I hadn't lied to the SS?

785
01:15:11,665 --> 01:15:12,945
You are a good women.

786
01:15:13,705 --> 01:15:14,785
You need your rest.

787
01:15:38,105 --> 01:15:39,305
I'll take it from here.

788
01:16:02,985 --> 01:16:04,825
What is the purpose of your travels?

789
01:16:04,905 --> 01:16:07,905
I have been ordered to deliver
this bicycle to Heimlich Abelard, sir.

790
01:16:07,985 --> 01:16:10,305
I'm not aware of a delivery
to Mr Abelard.

791
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:13,265
With urgency.

792
01:16:14,305 --> 01:16:16,265
So I shall be on my way.

793
01:16:55,825 --> 01:16:59,265
What we're doing is being good people.

794
01:17:00,905 --> 01:17:02,385
Does that make us stupid?

795
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:05,905
Would you not rather die stupid

796
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:08,465
then die guilty?

797
01:17:14,665 --> 01:17:16,705
Well, whatever happens with any of this,

798
01:17:16,785 --> 01:17:18,225
we must stay true

799
01:17:18,825 --> 01:17:21,345
to the people we have decided to be.

800
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,625
I will, my love.

801
01:17:28,545 --> 01:17:32,345
Are you suggesting to me
that this is only flu?

802
01:17:32,425 --> 01:17:35,065
I'm not suggesting, I'm telling you.

803
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:37,705
And the rash on her arm?

804
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:42,425
Excuse my lack of appreciation,
doctor, but...

805
01:17:43,185 --> 01:17:45,745
have you seen the environment
these women are living in?

806
01:17:46,305 --> 01:17:47,105
Rats,

807
01:17:48,105 --> 01:17:50,025
feces, the dead.

808
01:17:50,105 --> 01:17:52,585
Why are you still on duty here?
This is her job.

809
01:17:54,185 --> 01:17:55,665
The woman is exhausted.

810
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,425
She has worked 18 months without a break.

811
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:00,225
Sleepless nights.

812
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:02,265
Now, if you will,

813
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:04,145
my shift is not yet over.

814
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,305
I'm keeping a close eye on you.

815
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:16,705
I will be better soon.

816
01:18:18,465 --> 01:18:20,465
Until then...

817
01:18:20,545 --> 01:18:22,225
...you rest.

818
01:19:05,705 --> 01:19:06,905
Catch your breath.

819
01:19:10,825 --> 01:19:13,025
They could still be following us.

820
01:19:13,105 --> 01:19:14,145
What about Mother?

821
01:19:15,345 --> 01:19:17,705
She will bring your brother
and sister to safety.

822
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:19,425
Will we see them again?

823
01:19:21,585 --> 01:19:22,705
We need to run.

824
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,905
Dr Mengele, what are you doing?

825
01:20:45,985 --> 01:20:47,865
There are rumors of liberation.

826
01:20:48,425 --> 01:20:50,265
This research must be destroyed.

827
01:20:51,385 --> 01:20:53,825
You're going to abandon
all your present subjects?

828
01:20:53,905 --> 01:20:57,305
In two weeks' time, there will be no walls
for the subjects to be tested on.

829
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:59,105
Oh, and where are you going?

830
01:20:59,825 --> 01:21:01,945
The Gross-Rosen camp in the south-east.

831
01:21:02,745 --> 01:21:05,545
You will continue to run away
until you're caught.

832
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:07,105
I will run until I need to.

833
01:21:07,785 --> 01:21:09,385
I suggest the same for you, doctor.

834
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:32,585
What are you doing here?

835
01:21:32,665 --> 01:21:34,945
I'm admiring your naivety.

836
01:21:35,025 --> 01:21:38,185
I can assume you're good at reading data.

837
01:21:38,665 --> 01:21:42,065
But I can assure you,
you cannot read my mind.

838
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:43,105
You think?

839
01:21:43,185 --> 01:21:46,145
I have... doubted myself.

840
01:21:47,185 --> 01:21:48,585
That I can get well.

841
01:21:50,665 --> 01:21:52,945
And you stopped doubting yourself.

842
01:21:53,905 --> 01:21:54,905
Why?

843
01:21:54,985 --> 01:21:59,025
Because the hope I have invested
in everyone around me

844
01:21:59,105 --> 01:22:02,305
cannot be unless I demonstrate it myself.

845
01:22:04,265 --> 01:22:05,585
To live for others.

846
01:22:07,345 --> 01:22:10,385
I had a similar conversation
with an optimist once.

847
01:22:11,145 --> 01:22:12,545
After she prayed

848
01:22:13,305 --> 01:22:16,785
and after she preached to me about hope.

849
01:22:17,225 --> 01:22:18,985
And how did that end?

850
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:20,625
However you want it to.

851
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:26,865
Why?

852
01:22:27,905 --> 01:22:28,785
Lord.

853
01:22:32,305 --> 01:22:33,745
Answer me!

854
01:22:34,505 --> 01:22:36,745
Why, Lord?

855
01:22:42,705 --> 01:22:44,345
I shall conquer this.

856
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:49,465
We shall conquer this.

857
01:23:13,065 --> 01:23:14,065
How are you?

858
01:23:15,705 --> 01:23:17,705
I have been very sick, my child.

859
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:19,225
But you're strong.

860
01:23:20,985 --> 01:23:22,185
As are you.

861
01:23:27,345 --> 01:23:28,305
The child?

862
01:23:30,185 --> 01:23:31,985
Taken from my arms.

863
01:23:33,785 --> 01:23:35,625
Murdered before my eyes.

864
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:42,425
My child that lived inside me for so long,

865
01:23:42,505 --> 01:23:44,145
safe and healthy,

866
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:46,025
has been killed.

867
01:23:47,825 --> 01:23:49,905
The camp is being liberated.

868
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:52,585
How do you know?

869
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:54,265
We need to be ready.

870
01:23:54,345 --> 01:23:57,785
What's the point of living
knowing that my child is dead?

871
01:23:59,305 --> 01:24:02,985
And I... I couldn't protect her.

872
01:24:04,465 --> 01:24:07,945
Every life has the chance to be full.

873
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,225
You will have other children.

874
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:13,945
You will live a full life.

875
01:24:14,785 --> 01:24:16,585
I have faith in that.

876
01:24:56,225 --> 01:24:57,665
For something so silent...

877
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:00,425
you say so much.

878
01:25:04,505 --> 01:25:05,865
My name is Fritz Hollman.

879
01:25:08,065 --> 01:25:08,865
For now.

880
01:25:18,225 --> 01:25:19,505
You scare crows.

881
01:25:22,385 --> 01:25:23,305
Inspiring.

882
01:25:26,505 --> 01:25:28,425
I grew up in the country, not far.

883
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:32,705
And now...

884
01:25:35,745 --> 01:25:36,665
I'm a prisoner.

885
01:25:37,785 --> 01:25:38,785
Fugitive.

886
01:25:41,185 --> 01:25:42,665
I am a man...

887
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:46,905
who has been sinned against
more than sinning.

888
01:25:52,185 --> 01:25:53,545
I'll share a secret with you.

889
01:25:57,425 --> 01:25:59,065
I'm going to Buenos Aires.

890
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:03,425
I have friends from the Fatherland there.

891
01:26:04,905 --> 01:26:05,905
I will be safe.

892
01:26:14,345 --> 01:26:15,945
What happens to you eventually?

893
01:26:18,905 --> 01:26:21,865
Do you just fade to dust in the wind?

894
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:29,585
I guess we all fade to dust.

895
01:26:44,105 --> 01:26:45,185
Sweet?

896
01:27:33,785 --> 01:27:35,185
Signature, please.

897
01:27:45,825 --> 01:27:46,625
Sir?

898
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:51,425
Sir.

899
01:27:54,505 --> 01:27:55,305
Thank you.

900
01:29:20,305 --> 01:29:21,385
My boy.

901
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:32,625
Come in.

902
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:46,185
You have a lovely home.

903
01:29:46,825 --> 01:29:49,425
Thank you. I painted it myself.

904
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:52,905
Now Hitler, there was a painter.

905
01:29:55,865 --> 01:29:56,825
How was the journey?

906
01:29:57,785 --> 01:29:58,625
It was good.

907
01:29:59,225 --> 01:30:00,785
I ate on the train.

908
01:30:01,345 --> 01:30:02,425
Good food?

909
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,785
Train food.

910
01:30:10,185 --> 01:30:11,065
Thank you...

911
01:30:12,105 --> 01:30:12,945
for writing.

912
01:30:14,225 --> 01:30:16,105
The letters...

913
01:30:16,185 --> 01:30:19,345
I would wait for the postman to deliver.

914
01:30:20,745 --> 01:30:22,545
I can't imagine what you've been through.

915
01:30:24,025 --> 01:30:25,425
I've seen the pictures.

916
01:30:26,425 --> 01:30:29,985
Please. Do not believe all the crap
you see from these people.

917
01:30:30,945 --> 01:30:32,785
It's like I've been living a nightmare.

918
01:30:35,025 --> 01:30:36,825
That's a waste.

919
01:30:36,905 --> 01:30:38,225
I'm concerned.

920
01:30:38,785 --> 01:30:40,585
That you may have a different
frame of mind.

921
01:30:43,345 --> 01:30:45,945
You should see the data,

922
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:48,865
the information I collected
with my experiments.

923
01:30:50,465 --> 01:30:51,305
Now...

924
01:30:53,065 --> 01:30:53,985
nothing.

925
01:30:55,905 --> 01:30:58,345
But you are pleased that the camp
has been liberated?

926
01:31:00,105 --> 01:31:01,305
The Jews won the day.

927
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:05,385
And I am scratching around
trying to find documents

928
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:08,385
so I can lead a guilt-free life.

929
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:11,225
Alright.

930
01:31:12,145 --> 01:31:14,065
You look like you disapprove, boy.

931
01:31:14,145 --> 01:31:15,145
You're my father.

932
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,145
I would never betray you.

933
01:31:18,225 --> 01:31:19,505
You stay as long as you need.

934
01:31:23,305 --> 01:31:24,265
Thank you.

935
01:31:30,505 --> 01:31:31,825
Are you comfortable?

936
01:31:33,065 --> 01:31:36,505
If you hadn't slept in two years

937
01:31:36,585 --> 01:31:38,465
would you be comfortable?

938
01:31:39,505 --> 01:31:41,825
Were you forced not to sleep?

939
01:31:43,145 --> 01:31:45,425
There was nothing more rewarding

940
01:31:45,505 --> 01:31:49,225
than hearing the cry of a newborn baby

941
01:31:49,305 --> 01:31:52,385
that I had just assisted into the world.

942
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:55,625
What were the conditions?
We have all seen the pictures

943
01:31:55,705 --> 01:31:58,505
but are they as gruesome as they look?

944
01:31:59,665 --> 01:32:02,225
The pictures are...

945
01:32:02,905 --> 01:32:06,345
a mouse's squeak to a lion's roar.

946
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:10,385
Rats, feces, urine,

947
01:32:10,465 --> 01:32:14,265
old hay for bedding,
no space for the women to sleep

948
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:16,745
or deliver their children.

949
01:32:17,705 --> 01:32:20,905
Without heat, freezing almost to death.

950
01:32:21,785 --> 01:32:24,305
The smell was...

951
01:32:28,105 --> 01:32:29,425
unimaginable.

952
01:32:30,985 --> 01:32:33,505
I did my best

953
01:32:33,585 --> 01:32:36,705
to keep the women away from infection,

954
01:32:37,665 --> 01:32:39,265
infested bodies.

955
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:43,985
When the rain came down

956
01:32:44,065 --> 01:32:45,985
we were all soaked through.

957
01:32:46,745 --> 01:32:50,265
Walking in puddles 12 inches high

958
01:32:50,345 --> 01:32:53,825
just to get from one end of the barrack
to the other.

959
01:32:55,505 --> 01:32:57,505
They were the best days

960
01:32:57,585 --> 01:33:00,185
because they drowned the rats

961
01:33:00,265 --> 01:33:04,185
and kept the evil doctors out.

962
01:33:05,425 --> 01:33:07,905
And you dealt with this alone?

963
01:33:07,985 --> 01:33:10,425
Soon after the baby was born,

964
01:33:10,505 --> 01:33:14,665
I would tattoo the newborn
under the armpit.

965
01:33:15,825 --> 01:33:19,305
What gave you the motivation
to not give up?

966
01:33:22,025 --> 01:33:25,545
Because I had the power

967
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:28,865
to bring life into the world.

968
01:33:29,705 --> 01:33:33,105
In the two years that I was in Auschwitz,

969
01:33:33,185 --> 01:33:36,625
I delivered over 3,000 children.

970
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:41,345
Life gave me the motivation to

971
01:33:41,425 --> 01:33:43,425
help the mothers in need.

972
01:33:43,505 --> 01:33:46,385
To deliver their child
as safely as possible.

973
01:33:47,825 --> 01:33:51,345
And together they cherish

974
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:54,785
the most beautiful thing in this world.

975
01:33:54,865 --> 01:33:56,785
The smile of a child.

976
01:33:58,425 --> 01:33:59,705
Precisely.

977
01:34:00,345 --> 01:34:02,865
Mother, who are you talking to?

978
01:34:03,665 --> 01:34:05,745
My dear daughter,

979
01:34:06,705 --> 01:34:10,625
you will think I have
completely lost my mind.

980
01:34:12,185 --> 01:34:15,985
The only way I have managed
to get through this

981
01:34:16,505 --> 01:34:18,665
is by talking to others

982
01:34:18,745 --> 01:34:22,225
and inspiring them with my words.

983
01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:27,065
I need to do that for myself now.

984
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:32,225
The only person who will completely listen

985
01:34:32,745 --> 01:34:35,905
and completely understand

986
01:34:35,985 --> 01:34:37,825
what I am saying...

987
01:34:40,185 --> 01:34:41,105
is me.

988
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:32,905
Wolfgang, huh?

989
01:35:33,985 --> 01:35:37,825
I'm talking to a spirit who's identity's
turned more times than the tide itself.

990
01:36:56,785 --> 01:36:59,585
A drowning. Over in second.

991
01:37:00,905 --> 01:37:02,185
You're an alias to the world.

992
01:37:03,385 --> 01:37:04,545
An alias to me.

993
01:37:10,705 --> 01:37:13,025
OK, now, we're going to take

994
01:37:13,105 --> 01:37:15,105
big deep...

995
01:37:15,185 --> 01:37:16,025
I can't do it.

996
01:37:17,905 --> 01:37:19,545
Of course you can.

997
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:20,905
Now, push.

998
01:37:25,585 --> 01:37:27,945
That's it. That's it.

999
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:41,737
