1
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,600
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,640
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,760
<i>Loud and clear, kid.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

4
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,440
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,360
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube</i>
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

6
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>The sensors are placed.</i>
<i>I'm going back.</i>

7
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,120
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,200
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,480
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

10
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,560
Steady.

11
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,080
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,280
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,200
All right.
Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

15
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,360
Solo.

16
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,160
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,920
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,160
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.

21
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,040
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,360
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,240
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,160
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,640
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,360
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

27
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,240
That's right.

28
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,320
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

29
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,320
Han.

30
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,000
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,120
Han, we need you.

33
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,240
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,760
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,240
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,720
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,120
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,720
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,320
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,000
Come on.

41
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
Am I?
Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,360
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

44
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,120
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,680
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,960
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,400
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
Oh, switch off!

51
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,800
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,960
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,040
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,520
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,720
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,600
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,880
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,680
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,040
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,560
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might l...

61
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,360
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,080
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,320
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,280
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

66
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,600
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,600
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,640
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,960
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,480
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,520
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,640
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

74
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,600
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,680
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,760
There's really
nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,840
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,640
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,440
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

81
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,000
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,000
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no...

83
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,920
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,920
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,280
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,480
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,400
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,400
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,080
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,600
from time to time.

92
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,480
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,880
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,640
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,720
<i>Luke.</i>

96
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,760
Luke.

97
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,480
Ben?

98
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,120
You will go to
the Dagobah system.

99
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,880
Dagobah system?

100
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
There you will
learn from Yoda...

101
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,080
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

102
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.

103
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,000
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,320
Hang on, kid.

105
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,520
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,200
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,360
Yoda.

108
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,800
But it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,880
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,520
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,400
on the outside.

112
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,280
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,240
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

114
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,840
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

115
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,800
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,480
This is Rogue Two.

117
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,320
Captain Solo, do you copy?

118
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,080
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

119
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,960
This is Rogue Two.

120
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,080
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

121
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,880
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

122
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,480
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.

123
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,960
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

124
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,080
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

125
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,760
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

126
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,280
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

127
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,120
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

128
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,880
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

129
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,280
Well, Your Worship...

130
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,400
Iooks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

131
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,320
I had nothing to do with it.

132
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,960
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

133
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,880
until we've activated the energy field.

134
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
That's a good story.

135
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,080
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

136
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

137
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,840
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

138
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,920
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

139
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,160
She expressed
her true feelings for me.

140
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
My...

141
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,800
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

142
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,880
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

143
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,920
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

144
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,360
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

145
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,680
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

146
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,920
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command centre.</i>

147
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,920
Take it easy.

148
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,000
Excuse us, please.

149
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,160
Princess, we have a visitor.

150
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,000
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

151
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,280
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

152
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,040
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

153
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,680
There's something
very weak coming through.

154
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,800
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

155
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,920
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

156
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,680
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

157
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,680
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

158
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,360
- "I'm afraid there's not much le"ft.
- What was it?

159
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,440
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.</i>

160
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,840
- "Must have had a self-destruct."
- An imperial probe droid.

161
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,720
<i>It's a good bet the Empire</i>
<i>knows we're here.</i>

162
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,000
We'd better start the evacuation.

163
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,520
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

164
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,640
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

165
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,520
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

166
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,640
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

167
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,560
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

168
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,840
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

169
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,880
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

170
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,280
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

171
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,880
That's it.
The rebels are there.

172
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,240
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

173
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,040
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

174
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,440
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

175
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,440
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

176
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,840
General Veers,
prepare your men.

177
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,240
Admiral.

178
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,800
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

179
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,640
As soon as each transport is loaded...

180
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,760
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

181
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,440
Right, sir.

182
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,520
All right. That's it.

183
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
Try it.

184
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,320
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

186
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,440
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

187
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,560
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

188
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,800
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

189
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay, okay.

190
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
Hi, kid.

191
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,880
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

192
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
Wait a second.

193
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,680
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

194
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,720
Be careful.

195
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,600
You too.

196
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,320
General, there's
a fleet of Stardestroyers...

197
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,560
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

198
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,520
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

199
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,640
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

200
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,720
Prepare for ground assault.

201
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,240
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

202
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,320
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

203
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,920
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

204
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,440
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

205
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,920
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

206
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,000
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

207
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,240
He felt surprise was wiser.

208
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,360
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

209
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,960
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

210
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,640
Yes, my lord.

211
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,360
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

212
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,400
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,</i>
<i>and we're preparing to...</i>

213
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,400
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

214
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,800
- Captain Piett.
- "Yes, my lord?"

215
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

216
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,720
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

217
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,920
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

218
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,760
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

219
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,280
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

220
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

221
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,040
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

222
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,120
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

223
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,600
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

224
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,720
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

225
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,840
The ion cannon will fire
several shots...

226
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,920
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

227
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,040
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

228
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,160
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

229
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,080
Understood?

230
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,720
Good luck.

231
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,240
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.

232
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,640
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

233
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
Prepare to open shield.

234
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,160
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

235
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,280
Good. Our first catch of the day.

236
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,240
Stand by, ion control.

237
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,240
Fire.

238
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,760
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

239
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,560
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

240
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,600
Feeling all right, sir?

241
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,520
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

242
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,440
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

243
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,520
I know what you mean.

244
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,240
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

245
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,760
<i>Imperial walkers</i>
<i>on the north ridge.</i>

246
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,160
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

247
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,240
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

248
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,440
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

249
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,960
Steady, Dak.

250
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,800
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

251
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm coming in.

252
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,360
Hobbie, you still with me?

253
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,240
That armour's too strong for blasters.

254
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,640
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

255
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,840
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.

256
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,320
Stand by, Dak.

257
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,120
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.

258
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,160
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

259
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,120
Just hang on.

260
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,880
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

261
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,000
Dak?

262
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

263
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,080
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

264
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
Rogue Three.

265
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,440
Copy, Rogue Leader.

266
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,400
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.</i>
<i>You'll have to make this shot.</i>

267
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,200
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

268
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,520
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

269
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,560
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

270
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,760
Steady, Rogue Two.

271
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,680
Activate harpoon.

272
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,000
Good shot, Janson.

273
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,040
One more pass.

274
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,520
Cable out.
Let her go!

275
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,800
Detach cable.

276
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,600
Cable detached.

277
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,760
Come on!

278
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,720
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

279
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,240
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

280
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,560
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

281
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,240
We have no choice.

282
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,720
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

283
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,760
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

284
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,200
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

285
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,040
And do take good care of yourself.

286
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

287
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,080
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

288
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,600
Prepare to target
the main generator.

289
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,400
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

290
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,280
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

291
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,640
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.

292
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,760
Set for position three.

293
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
Steady.

294
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,600
Stay tight and low.
This is it!

295
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,440
Hobbie!

296
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,000
I've been hit!

297
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

298
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,560
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

299
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

300
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,040
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

301
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,120
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

302
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,680
<i>Imperial troops</i>
<i>have entered the base.</i>

303
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,360
<i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>

304
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Come on. That's it.

305
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,600
Give the evacuation code signal.

306
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,440
And get to your transports.

307
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,600
Wait for me.

308
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,160
Begin retreat!

309
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,920
Fall back!

310
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,480
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

311
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,040
Target. Maximum firepower.

312
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,800
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

313
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,760
I'll get her out on the "Falcon."
Come on.

314
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,280
Where are you going?
Come back!

315
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,240
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

316
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,120
- How typical.
- Come on.

317
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,720
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

318
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,480
Wait! Wait!

319
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,760
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

320
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,000
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

321
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,800
Sir, might I suggest that you...

322
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,480
It can wait.

323
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,960
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

324
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,080
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

325
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,600
Come on! Come on!

326
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,520
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

327
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,120
See?

328
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,480
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

329
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,280
Punch it!

330
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,640
R2.

331
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,200
Get her ready for take-off.

332
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,440
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

333
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,160
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

334
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,240
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

335
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,520
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

336
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,240
Yes, R2.

337
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,840
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

338
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,200
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

339
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,360
Stardestroyers,
two of'em coming right at us.

340
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,160
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

341
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,880
Check the deflector shield.

342
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,840
Take evasive action!

343
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,560
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

344
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,200
They're getting closer.

345
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,360
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

346
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,920
Watch what?

347
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,800
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

348
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,280
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

349
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,360
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

350
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,640
Horizontal boosters!

351
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,680
Alluvial dampers.

352
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,000
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.

353
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,920
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

354
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,640
Chewie!

355
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,160
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

356
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,600
Han, get up here.

357
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,640
Come on, Chewie!

358
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,440
Asteroids.

359
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,680
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

360
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,280
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

361
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,040
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

362
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,960
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

363
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,160
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

364
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,400
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

365
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,200
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

366
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,920
I take it back.

367
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,000
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

368
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,840
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

369
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,680
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.

370
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,560
- Closer?
- Closer?

371
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,400
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

372
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,400
There. That looks pretty good.

373
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,320
What looks pretty good?

374
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,720
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

375
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,560
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

376
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,240
I hope you know
what you're doing.

377
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,680
Yeah. Me too.

378
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,280
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

379
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,800
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

380
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,080
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

381
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,160
Massive life form readings though.

382
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,160
There's something alive down there.

383
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,480
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

384
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,560
I know! I know!

385
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,240
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

386
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,240
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

387
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,720
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

388
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
R2?

389
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,040
Where are you?

390
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,800
R2!

391
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,920
You be more careful.

392
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,480
R2, that way.

393
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,680
R2!

394
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,640
Oh, no.

395
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,840
Are you all right?
Come on.

396
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,200
You were lucky
to get out of there.

397
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,120
Anything broken?

398
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,720
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

399
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,880
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

400
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,600
R2, what are we doing here?

401
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,040
It's like...

402
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,080
something out of a dream or...

403
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,960
I don't know.

404
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,040
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

405
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,400
Yes, Admiral?

406
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,480
Our ships have sighted
the "Millennium Falcon," lord...

407
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,600
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

408
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,360
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

409
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,880
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

410
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

411
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,640
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

412
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,760
No. I need you
to talk to the "Falcon..."

413
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,000
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

414
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,920
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

415
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,840
Not entirely stable?

416
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,920
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

417
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,480
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

418
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,960
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.

419
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,320
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

420
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,560
Let go.

421
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,560
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

422
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,200
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

423
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,080
Sorry, sweetheart.

424
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,800
I haven't got time
for anything else.

425
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,120
Ready for some power?
Okay.

426
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,280
Let's see now.

427
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,640
Put that in there.
There you go.

428
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,280
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

429
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,600
if he even exists.

430
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,680
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

431
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,800
This place gives me the creeps.

432
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,920
Still...

433
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,080
there's something familiar
about this place.

434
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,000
I don't know.

435
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,080
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

436
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,680
Like we're being watched.

437
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,680
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.

438
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,440
I am wondering,
why are you here?

439
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,960
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

440
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,600
Found someone you have,
I would say.

441
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,240
Right.

442
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,440
Help you I can. Yes.

443
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,400
I don't think so.

444
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,600
I'm looking for a great warrior.

445
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,280
Great warrior.

446
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,360
Wars not make one great.

447
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,080
Put that down.

448
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,000
Hey! That's my dinner.

449
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,840
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

450
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,080
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

451
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,640
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

452
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,720
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

453
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,440
Get out of there.

454
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,800
Hey, you could have broken this.

455
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,320
Don't do that.

456
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,000
You're making a mess.

457
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,400
Hey, give me that.

458
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,920
Mine, or I will help you not.

459
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,960
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

460
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,760
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

461
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,920
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.

462
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,960
R2, let him have it.

463
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,200
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

464
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,160
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

465
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,280
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

466
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,880
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

467
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,240
Jedi master. Yoda.

468
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,800
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

469
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,520
Take you to him I will.

470
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,680
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

471
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,400
Come.
Good food. Come.

472
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,360
Come, come.

473
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,520
R2...

474
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,480
stay and watch after the camp.

475
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,480
Where is R2 when I need him?

476
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,160
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

477
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,080
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

478
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,600
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

479
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,080
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

480
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,240
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

481
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,600
Here. And, Chewie...

482
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,760
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

483
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,800
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

484
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,280
Would you please
stop calling me that?

485
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,280
Sure, Leia.

486
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,680
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

487
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,840
You could be a little nicer though.

488
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,560
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

489
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,960
Occasionally, maybe...

490
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,480
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

491
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,920
Scoundrel?

492
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,400
I like the sound of that.

493
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,080
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

494
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,280
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

495
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,480
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

496
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,680
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

497
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,560
I'm not trembling.

498
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,360
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

499
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,760
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

500
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,880
I happen to like nice men.

501
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,560
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

502
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,320
Sir, sir!

503
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,160
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

504
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,480
Thank you.

505
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,440
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

506
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,280
<i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time</i>
<i>they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

507
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,240
<i>Considering the damage we've sustained,</i>
<i>they must have been destroyed.</i>

508
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,480
No, Captain, they're alive.

509
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,760
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

510
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,280
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

511
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,560
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

512
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,760
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

513
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,040
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

514
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,760
Yes, my lord.

515
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,120
What is thy bidding, my master?

516
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,240
<i>There is a great disturbance</i>
<i>in the Force.</i>

517
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,280
I have felt it.

518
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,840
<i>We have a new enemy...</i>

519
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,840
<i>the young rebel who destroyed</i>
<i>the Death Star.</i>

520
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,920
<i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>

521
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,280
<i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

522
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,520
How is that possible?

523
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,880
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

524
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,080
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

525
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,600
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

526
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,680
He's just a boy.

527
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,200
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

528
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,760
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

529
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,760
<i>The son of Skywalker</i>
<i>must not become a Jedi.</i>

530
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,960
If he could be turned...

531
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,840
he would become a powerful ally.

532
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,480
<i>Yes.</i>

533
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,360
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

534
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,640
<i>Can it be done?</i>

535
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,560
He will join us or die, master.

536
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,280
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

537
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,040
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

538
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,240
Eat. Eat.

539
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,320
Hot.

540
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,680
Good food. Good.

541
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,600
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

542
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,840
Not far. Yoda not far.

543
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,640
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.

544
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,520
Root leaf. I cook.

545
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,640
Why wish you become Jedi?

546
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,240
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

547
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,320
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.

548
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,400
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

549
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,920
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

550
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,400
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

551
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,960
I cannot teach him.

552
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,040
The boy has no patience.

553
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,280
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

554
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,240
Much anger in him...

555
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,080
like his father.

556
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,760
<i>Was I any different</i>
<i>when you taught me?</i>

557
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,000
No.

558
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,000
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

559
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,760
I am ready.

560
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,720
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm...

561
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,520
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?

562
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,400
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

563
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,160
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

564
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,640
AJedi must have
the deepest commitment...

565
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,520
the most serious mind.

566
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,440
This one a long time have I watched.

567
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,120
All his life
has he looked away...

568
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,120
to the future,
to the horizon.

569
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,640
Never his mind on where he was...

570
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,920
what he was doing.

571
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,520
Adventure.

572
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,400
Excitement.

573
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,640
AJedi craves not these things.

574
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,320
You are reckless.

575
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,240
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

576
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,360
He is too old.

577
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,320
Yes, too old to begin the training.

578
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,280
But I've learned so much.

579
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,960
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

580
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm not afraid.

581
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,320
You will be.

582
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,400
You will be.

583
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,240
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

584
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,280
There's something out there.

585
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,280
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

586
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,360
There it is. Listen!

587
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,280
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

588
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,840
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

589
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,000
Then I'm going with you.

590
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,160
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

591
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,240
Oh, no.

592
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,680
This ground sure feels strange.

593
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,200
It doesn't feel like rock.

594
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,000
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

595
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,680
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

596
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,960
Yeah.

597
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,840
Watch out!

598
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,280
It's all right. It's all right.

599
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,760
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

600
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,880
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

601
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,800
chewing on the power cables.

602
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,440
Mynocks?

603
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,680
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

604
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,840
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

605
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,600
Wait a minute.

606
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,720
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

607
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,800
No time to discuss this
in committee!

608
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,600
I am not a committee!

609
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,560
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

610
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,040
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.

611
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,920
- Look!
- I see it.

612
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,320
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

613
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,240
- This is no cave.
- What?

614
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,720
Yes, run.

615
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,320
Yes.

616
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,640
AJedi's strength
flows from the Force.

617
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,040
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

618
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,240
The dark side
of the Force are they.

619
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,800
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

620
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,040
If once you start down
the dark path...

621
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,360
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

622
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,280
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

623
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,160
Vader.

624
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,240
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

625
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,800
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

626
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

627
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,920
You will know...

628
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,200
when you are calm,
at peace...

629
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,600
passive.

630
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,640
AJedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence...

631
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,520
never for attack.

632
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,120
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

633
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,880
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

634
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,880
Clear your mind of questions.

635
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,920
There's something not right here.

636
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,000
I feel cold.

637
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,320
- Death.
- That place...

638
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,760
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

639
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,720
A domain of evil it is.

640
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,960
In you must go.

641
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,280
What's in there?

642
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,120
Only what you take with you.

643
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,920
Your weapons...

644
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,160
you will not need them.

645
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,200
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

646
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,960
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

647
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,600
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer "Avenger."

648
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,200
Right.

649
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:35,880
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the "Millennium Falcon."

650
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,920
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

651
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,080
but I want them alive.

652
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,520
No disintegrations.

653
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,400
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

654
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,440
My lord, we have them.

655
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,680
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

656
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,200
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

657
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,440
One, two...

658
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,640
three!

659
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,160
It's not fair.

660
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,360
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

661
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,280
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

662
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,800
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

663
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,080
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

664
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,840
Turn her around.

665
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,480
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

666
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,520
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

667
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,480
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

668
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,440
Shut up!

669
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,560
They're moving to attack position.

670
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,720
Shields up.

671
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,520
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

672
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,920
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

673
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,520
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

674
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,320
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

675
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,160
Get a shuttle ready.

676
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,040
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

677
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,120
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

678
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,800
Use the Force.

679
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,880
Yes.

680
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,960
Now, the stone.

681
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,520
Feel it.

682
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,480
Concentrate!

683
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,480
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.

684
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,240
So certain are you.

685
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,240
Always with you
it cannot be done.

686
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,320
Hear you nothing that I say?

687
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

688
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,320
This is totally different.

689
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,600
No. No different.

690
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,720
Only different in your mind.

691
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,920
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

692
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,200
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

693
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,400
Do...

694
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,040
or do not.

695
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,760
There is no try.

696
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,200
I can't. It's too big.

697
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,280
Size matters not.

698
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,280
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?

699
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,680
And well you should not...

700
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,320
for my ally is the Force.

701
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,720
And a powerful ally it is.

702
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,040
Life creates it...

703
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,120
makes it grow.

704
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,640
Its energy surrounds us...

705
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,360
and binds us.

706
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,560
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

707
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,720
You must feel
the Force around you.

708
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,040
Here, between you, me...

709
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,040
the tree, the rock...

710
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,160
everywhere.

711
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,640
Yes...

712
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,400
even between
the land and the ship.

713
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,280
You want the impossible.

714
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,360
I don't believe it.

715
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,840
That is why you fail.

716
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,440
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

717
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,520
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

718
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,520
If the "Millennium Falcon"
went into light speed...

719
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,480
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

720
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,360
Alert all commands.

721
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,560
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

722
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,920
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

723
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,760
Admiral.

724
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,000
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

725
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,440
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

726
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,520
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

727
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,600
The fleet's beginning to break up.

728
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,480
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

729
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,640
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

730
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,080
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

731
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
The Empire may be
gracious enough...

732
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,640
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

733
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,600
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

734
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,880
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

735
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,880
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

736
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,360
Then what?

737
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,600
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

738
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,040
Any ideas?

739
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,440
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

740
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,040
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.

741
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,880
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.

742
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,760
- Lando.
- Lando system?

743
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,320
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

744
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,600
Card player, gambler.

745
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,200
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

746
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,880
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

747
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,240
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

748
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,120
Lando conned somebody out of it.

749
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,840
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

750
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,760
- Can you trust him?
- No.

751
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,640
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

752
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,200
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.

753
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,600
You do have your moments.

754
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,160
Not many of them,
but you do have them.

755
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,360
Concentrate.

756
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,560
Feel the Force flow.

757
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,240
Yes.

758
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,200
Good.

759
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,640
Calm.

760
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,040
Yes.

761
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,400
Through the Force,
things you will see.

762
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,840
Other places.
The future. The past.

763
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,280
Old friends long gone.

764
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,760
Control, control.

765
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,000
You must learn control.

766
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,720
I saw a city in the clouds.

767
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,800
Friends you have there.

768
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,320
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

769
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,440
Future?

770
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,440
Will they die?

771
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,560
Difficult to see.

772
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,040
Always in motion is the future.

773
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,800
I've gotta go to them.

774
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,640
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

775
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,520
If you leave now,
help them you could...

776
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,960
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

777
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,120
No, I don't have a landing permit.

778
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,720
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

779
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,880
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

780
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,880
<i>You will not deviate</i>
<i>from your present course.</i>

781
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,600
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

782
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,080
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

783
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,800
<i>Permission granted to land</i>
<i>on Platform 327.</i>

784
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,240
Thank you.

785
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,880
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

786
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,600
Who's worried?

787
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,800
No one to meet us.

788
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,400
I don't like this.

789
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,240
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

790
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,960
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

791
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,640
Trust me.

792
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,160
See? My friend.

793
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,360
Keep your eyes open.

794
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,520
Hey.

795
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,560
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

796
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,720
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

797
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,120
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

798
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,160
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

799
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,240
Yes. Very friendly.

800
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,920
What are you doing here?

801
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,960
Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.

802
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,600
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

803
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:50,120
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

804
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,280
How you doin', Chewbacca?

805
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,760
Still hanging around with this loser?

806
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,920
Hello.
What have we here?

807
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,760
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

808
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,680
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

809
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,360
Welcome, Leia.

810
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,800
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.

811
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,400
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

812
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,200
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

813
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,600
- What's wrong with the "Falcon"?
- Hyperdrive.

814
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,680
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

815
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,760
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

816
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,320
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

817
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,960
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

818
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,760
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

819
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,840
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

820
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,040
I've had labour difficulties.

821
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,280
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

822
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,080
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

823
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,000
Who'd have thought that, huh?

824
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,920
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.

825
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,200
Yeah.

826
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,360
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

827
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,760
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

828
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,840
Nice to see a familiar face.

829
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,520
How rude!

830
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,000
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

831
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,640
I wonder if... Hello?

832
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,280
How interesting.

833
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,360
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

834
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,440
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

835
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,640
Luke, you must complete the training.

836
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,360
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

837
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,520
You must not go.

838
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,600
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- "You don't know that."

839
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,040
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

840
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,800
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

841
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,000
But you cannot control it.

842
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,440
This is a dangerous time for you...

843
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,440
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

844
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,640
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.

845
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,840
The cave.

846
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,960
Remember your failure at the cave.

847
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,920
But I've learned
so much since then.

848
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,600
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

849
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,600
You have my word.

850
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,400
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

851
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,120
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

852
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,080
That's why I have to go.

853
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:34,360
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

854
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,920
You won't.

855
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,200
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

856
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,360
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

857
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,960
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

858
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,080
If you end your training now...

859
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:53,320
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

860
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,960
you will become an agent of evil.

861
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,000
Patience.

862
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,120
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for...

863
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,200
yes.

864
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,280
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

865
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,320
I cannot interfere.

866
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,480
I understand.

867
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,440
R2, fire up the converters.

868
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,480
Don't give in to hate.

869
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,240
That leads to the dark side.

870
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,000
Strong is Vader.

871
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,520
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

872
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,880
I will.

873
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,360
And I'll return. I promise.

874
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,080
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

875
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,720
Now...

876
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,520
matters are worse.

877
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,600
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

878
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,520
No, there is another.

879
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,520
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

880
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,600
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

881
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,680
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

882
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,920
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

883
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,680
Relax.

884
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,560
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

885
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,040
I don't trust Lando.

886
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,360
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

887
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,040
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

888
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,400
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

889
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,440
What happened?

890
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,120
Where?

891
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,120
Found him in a junk pile?

892
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,680
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

893
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,120
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

894
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,400
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

895
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,400
Not really.

896
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,720
You look absolutely beautiful.

897
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:56,000
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

898
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,520
Thank you.

899
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,440
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

900
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,240
Everyone's invited, of course.

901
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,360
Having trouble with your droid?

902
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,000
No. No problem. Why?

903
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,880
You see, since we're
a small operation...

904
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,120
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

905
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,680
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

906
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,880
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

907
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,960
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

908
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:33,320
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

909
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,160
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

910
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,440
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

911
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,160
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

912
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,440
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

913
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,440
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

914
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,320
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

915
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,840
I'm sorry.

916
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,480
I'm sorry too.

917
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,040
No, 3PO's with them.

918
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,400
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

919
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,880
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

920
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,880
No, please don't get up.

921
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,720
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.

922
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,320
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

923
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,560
Lord Vader.

924
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,960
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

925
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,000
after I have Skywalker.

926
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,920
He's no good to me dead.

927
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,200
He will not be
permanently damaged.

928
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,960
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

929
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,680
They must never again leave this city.

930
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,880
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

931
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,760
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

932
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,360
No.

933
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,880
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

934
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,480
This deal is getting worse
all the time.

935
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,920
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

936
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,920
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

937
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,480
That's much better.

938
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,160
Wait. Wait.

939
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,240
Oh, my!
What have you done?

940
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,840
I'm backwards!

941
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,760
You flea-bitten furball!

942
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,440
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

943
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,320
I feel terrible.

944
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,920
Why are they doing this?

945
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,880
They never even asked me
any questions.

946
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,920
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

947
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,000
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

948
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,920
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

949
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,080
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

950
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,520
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

951
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,880
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

952
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,440
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

953
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,320
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

954
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,360
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?

955
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,600
My friend.

956
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,640
Stop!

957
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,960
I've done all I can.

958
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,400
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

959
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,760
Yeah.

960
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,640
You're a real hero.

961
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,360
You certainly
have a way with people.

962
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,920
This facility is crude...

963
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,000
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

964
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,280
for his journey to the emperor.

965
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,280
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

966
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,640
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

967
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:21,640
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

968
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,520
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.

969
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,600
We will test it on Captain Solo.

970
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,440
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

971
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,120
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

972
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,880
so don't do anything foolish.

973
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,360
What's going on, buddy?

974
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,280
You're being put into carbon freeze.

975
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,760
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

976
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,120
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

977
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,040
Chewbacca, stop!

978
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,080
No, Chewie, stop!

979
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,080
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

980
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,080
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.

981
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,600
Chewie, this won't help me.

982
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:41,200
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

983
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,560
The princess.

984
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,360
You have to take care of her.

985
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,440
Do you hear me?

986
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,600
- I love you.
- I know.

987
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:38,040
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.

988
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,480
They've encased him in carbonite.

989
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,400
He should be quite
well-protected...

990
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,360
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

991
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,880
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

992
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,560
Yes, he's alive.

993
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,200
And in perfect hibernation.

994
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,160
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

995
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,640
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

996
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,720
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

997
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,560
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

998
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,440
Calrissian...

999
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,880
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1000
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,040
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.

1001
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,120
I am altering the deal.

1002
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,840
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1003
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,560
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1004
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,040
It's a trap!

1005
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,840
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1006
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,120
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1007
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,160
Well done.

1008
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:50,560
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1009
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,280
Move.

1010
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,720
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1011
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,520
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1012
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,360
Do you think that
after what you did to Han...

1013
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:08,480
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1014
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:11,480
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1015
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,080
I'm just trying to help.

1016
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,720
We don't need any of your help.

1017
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,080
What?

1018
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:26,600
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1019
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,640
at the east... platform.

1020
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,720
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1021
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,520
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1022
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,000
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1023
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,760
R2, where have you been?

1024
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,680
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1025
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,480
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1026
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,440
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1027
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,800
Look what's happened to me.

1028
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,760
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!

1029
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,440
You have learned much, young one.

1030
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,600
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1031
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:56,680
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1032
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,880
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1033
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,920
All too easy.

1034
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,320
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1035
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,920
Impressive.

1036
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,160
Most impressive.

1037
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:35,240
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1038
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,000
Now, release your anger.

1039
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,600
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1040
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,040
The security code
has been changed.

1041
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:54,320
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1042
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:56,880
R2, hurry.

1043
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,240
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>

1044
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,240
<i>The Empire has taken control</i>
<i>of the city.</i>

1045
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:07,080
<i>I advise everyone to leave</i>
<i>before more imperial troops arrive.</i>

1046
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,880
This way.

1047
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,120
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1048
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:20,000
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1049
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,520
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the "Falcon." It's fixed!

1050
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,000
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1051
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,560
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1052
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,680
That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1053
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,840
Go!

1054
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,680
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1055
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,600
Of course I've looked better.

1056
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:41,600
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

1057
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:45,080
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1058
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:01,800
There is no escape.

1059
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,680
Don't make me destroy you.

1060
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:11,160
You do not yet realize
your importance.

1061
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,840
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1062
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,720
Join me...

1063
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,120
and I will complete your training.

1064
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,520
With our combined strength...

1065
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:23,440
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1066
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,760
and bring order to the galaxy.

1067
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:28,280
I'll never join you!

1068
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,320
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1069
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:36,480
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1070
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,960
He told me enough.

1071
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,240
He told me you killed him.

1072
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,960
I am your father.

1073
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,000
That's not true.

1074
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,400
That's impossible!

1075
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:01,640
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1076
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:14,080
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1077
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,960
It is your destiny.

1078
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:18,720
Join me...

1079
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,960
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1080
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:34,720
Come with me.

1081
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,640
It is the only way.

1082
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,520
Ben.

1083
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,120
Ben, please.

1084
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,440
Hear me.

1085
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,080
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1086
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,440
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1087
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,680
Chewie, just do it.

1088
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,440
All right, all right!

1089
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:41,200
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1090
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:53,280
Look, someone's up there.

1091
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,840
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

1092
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,120
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1093
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,640
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1094
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,560
- Lando?
- "Okay, let's go."

1095
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,160
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1096
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,040
I'll be back.

1097
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,880
Stardestroyer.

1098
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:51,280
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1099
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,360
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1100
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:55,720
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1101
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,240
Punch it!

1102
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,680
They told me they fixed it.

1103
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,600
I trusted them!

1104
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,120
It's not my fault!

1105
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,040
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1106
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:25,560
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the "Millennium Falcon?"

1107
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,600
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1108
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:31,200
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1109
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,200
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:38,880
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1111
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,520
We can't?

1112
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,920
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1113
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,840
The city's central computer told you?

1114
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,600
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1115
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:54,880
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.

1116
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,800
Father.

1117
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,640
Son, come with me.

1118
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,920
Ben.

1119
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,960
Why didn't you tell me?

1120
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,600
It's Vader.

1121
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:46,640
Luke, it is your destiny.

1122
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,200
Why didn't you tell me?

1123
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:06,000
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1124
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,960
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1125
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:15,440
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1126
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:19,800
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1127
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,240
You did it!

1128
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:22,480
- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- "Good luck, Lando."

1129
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:27,280
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt and</i>
<i>that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.</i>

1130
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:29,920
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1131
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:33,320
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.

1132
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,560
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1133
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,320
Take care, you two.

1134
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,400
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>
