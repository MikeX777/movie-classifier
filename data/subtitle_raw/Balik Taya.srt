1
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:25,243
Pip?

2
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:27,162
You ready?

3
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:43,929
How much?

4
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,851
Which one? Which one?

5
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:08,815
Sawahdee kah!

6
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:10,203
Kabayan!

7
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,866
- Filipino?
- Yes!

8
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,126
Kabayan!

9
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:13,952
Kabayan!

10
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:16,830
Bro, help me out,
you know where this is?

11
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:18,026
What's the address?

12
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,374
It's my employer, man.

13
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,349
Yeah, I know where that is!

14
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,389
- I'll bring you there.
- Really?

15
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:22,729
- Come on!
- Seriously?

16
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:23,982
Yeah, I know it!
Come on.

17
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,728
Thanks, man.

18
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:28,053
It's good there's a lot of Pinoys
here in Thailand.

19
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,934
Yeah, of course I'll help you.

20
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,842
Appreciate it.

21
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:42,896
- Kabayan, are we there yet?
- Almost there!

22
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:50,337
Get all his stuff!
Check his bag!

23
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:53,665
Hey! Let me go!

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Hold him!

25
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,556
There's a Buddhist saying that goes...

26
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,134
"If you meet Buddha on the road,

27
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,110
kill him."

28
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:12,150
It's probably an illusion.

29
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,180
Me?

30
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:18,198
I've already seen the most
beautiful illusion.

31
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:19,223
Hey!

32
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:21,017
Hey!

33
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,565
Careful.

34
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,392
We're almost there.

35
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,214
Just a sec.

36
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,596
Come in.

37
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,206
Thank you.

38
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:28,510
Ouch!

39
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,315
Stay there.

40
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:37,089
I'm going to get medicine for you.

41
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,626
Don't look, alright?

42
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,420
You aren't a pervert,
are you?

43
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,440
No way.

44
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:02,417
I know you're Filipino,
even if you don't look like one.

45
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,057
Let me do that.

46
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:10,935
You're like a kid.

47
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:27,487
Go! I told you to go!

48
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:28,828
- Don't come here!
- You don't want me anymore?

49
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:30,628
I don't want you anymore!

50
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:33,133
- You might regret this.
- Go! Leave me alone!

51
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,412
We broke up!

52
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,124
No!

53
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:37,984
- I like you.
- I don't like you!

54
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,297
Go!

55
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:42,077
What the fuck,
go away!

56
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,601
Or I will call the police!

57
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:46,222
Call them,
so they can deport you!

58
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,068
Is this your new guy?

59
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,366
- Leave us alone!
- You asshole!

60
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:52,805
Go! Just go!

61
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,965
Stop coming and seeing me!

62
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:56,466
Go!

63
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:57,935
Shithead!

64
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,165
Who was that?

65
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:02,806
My ex. Let's talk inside.

66
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:19,698
Sorry about that.

67
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:21,861
So who was it?

68
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:23,391
My ex.

69
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:26,774
He owns the bar in Patpong
I used to work at

70
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,500
during my early days in Thailand.

71
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:29,999
Where do you work now?

72
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,710
Secret.

73
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,413
I came to Thailand
to become a teacher.

74
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:44,347
But I wasn't so lucky.

75
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,689
That's why I ended up
in Cake's bar.

76
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:49,239
Cake?

77
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:51,056
What kind of name
is Cake?

78
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:52,147
Is that a call sign?

79
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,648
He's a thug,
but his name is Cake.

80
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:57,827
You moron, it's not like that.

81
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,426
That's just his nickname.

82
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:01,438
His real name is Ittipong.

83
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,902
- That's just how it is in Thailand.
- Ittipong.

84
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:08,297
His sibling's name is Donut.

85
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:12,292
- The fuck?
- Why are you laughing?

86
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,086
If you know what they're like,
you wouldn't be laughing!

87
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,605
- It's a stupid name.
- He has a lot of connections

88
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,174
that's why he can threaten
to have me deported.

89
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,410
What does he really want?

90
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,155
He wants us to get back together,

91
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,055
and go work at his bar again.

92
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:31,366
But he also wants me
to accept that

93
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,586
he's going to have
other girls, too.

94
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,323
I don't want that!

95
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:40,214
Not even for your peace of mind?

96
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,328
No thanks!

97
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,310
Wanna go back to
the Philippines, then?

98
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,151
I do, but...

99
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,727
Do I want my siblings to starve?

100
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:50,942
No way.

101
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,623
Look here,

102
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,343
I bought a cellphone
for my sibling.

103
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,433
Because he wanted
to do Tik-Tok.

104
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,215
It's cute, right?

105
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:01,633
You?

106
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,491
What will you do now?

107
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,179
Find my employer.

108
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:07,097
Do you remember the address?

109
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,187
Don't worry.

110
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:11,762
I'll help you.

111
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,025
Over here.

112
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:23,734
Here.

113
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,618
I wrote the directions there, okay?

114
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:26,894
You shouldn't get lost.

115
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,174
I don't get why you're doing this,

116
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:36,654
but thanks.

117
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,031
Especially for the phone.

118
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:40,618
You moron, it's nothing!

119
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:42,815
We'll help each other.
Same country and all.

120
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,319
You keep that for now,
but give it back

121
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,222
because I still need to send that
home to my sibling.

122
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:50,723
Yes, boss.

123
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:52,923
Thanks a lot!

124
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,797
You need to walk two blocks,

125
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,352
keep going straight.

126
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,938
When you get to the white building,

127
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:25,067
take a tuk-tuk.

128
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:45,302
Then get down and your office
should be there.

129
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:49,750
No!

130
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,103
We don't have issue this!

131
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:55,687
We are not looking for employees.

132
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:56,685
Ma'am,

133
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,466
my agency gave this to me,

134
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:00,654
this paper.

135
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,230
No, I don't have job.

136
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,291
No agency.

137
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:04,275
- Okay?
- Ma'am,

138
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,965
- Okay, okay.
- can you give me any job?

139
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:10,451
Ma'am, please, I'm begging,
I have no one else!

140
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:44,861
So, how'd it go?

141
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:49,346
Bad.

142
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,094
It was a scam.

143
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:52,944
The agency doesn't even exist.

144
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,038
Huh? I don't get it.

145
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,017
They gave me fake documents.

146
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,938
I didn't find work.

147
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,856
Nevermind.

148
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,263
There's loads of work here.

149
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,748
You just need to lay low for now.

150
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,423
I'll ask around the Pinoy Community.

151
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,590
Don't worry.

152
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:28,552
Let's walk around.

153
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:32,998
I know how you feel!

154
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,426
I've been there.

155
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,888
When I didn't get a job as a teacher,
I just thought...

156
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,935
What's gonna happen
to my six siblings now?

157
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,802
They already gave me a list
before I even left.

158
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:46,115
They all wanted shoes.

159
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:48,130
Like, fuck! What now?

160
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,271
I hooked up with Cake.

161
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,091
I didn't know he had other girls.

162
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:57,310
And now that I want out,

163
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:59,280
he's trying to get me back.

164
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:02,193
I just want to go back to the Philippines.

165
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:03,325
You sure?

166
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,706
I can help you get
work here, you know.

167
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,334
Probably not in Bangkok, though.

168
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,129
Maybe in the provinces.

169
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:16,935
At least you'll earn something.

170
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,592
Whatever gets you by, that's it?

171
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,599
Exactly!

172
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,623
I just realized

173
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:27,475
I've never made a selfish decision.

174
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,607
Everything had to include

175
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,310
my family.

176
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:34,435
Right? That's why we're
going to have fun now.

177
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,735
But I'm broke!

178
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:40,833
Did I make you pay
for anything?

179
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,708
It's my treat, so let's go!

180
00:14:55,864 --> 00:15:00,004
I made Cake my boyfriend
so I could keep my job.

181
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:04,129
You want to just buy clothes?

182
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,204
Or you're sticking to that?

183
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:09,700
Ow!

184
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,693
Hey, you've got a good eye!

185
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,708
Really?

186
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:20,497
Yeah!

187
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,629
See? Looks good.

188
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,336
You wanna go here?

189
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,897
No, not here!

190
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:47,025
- Why?
- I might run into Cake's men.

191
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,843
So what? We're just going
to drink.

192
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,161
Forget it, let's go!

193
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:14,323
You know, I used to be a bar girl.

194
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:16,313
That was my first job.

195
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,933
But I'm a college graduate,
mind you!

196
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:20,088
Really?

197
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:23,104
You're kind of nosy.

198
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,721
Aren't we buddies?

199
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:27,924
You took me around town for free.

200
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,502
Shut up and drink.

201
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:34,013
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

202
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:45,102
Is that a kiss mark?

203
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:47,511
Did I do that?

204
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,675
That's a birthmark.

205
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:52,149
Unique, right?

206
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:56,851
If I die, I'll be identified immediately.

207
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:58,650
Why are you so morbid?

208
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:01,197
We're really talking
about that after sex?

209
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:04,828
- What topic did you have in mind?
- Anything!

210
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:07,885
You haven't even told me
where you live!

211
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,602
In Albay.

212
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:10,728
Albay?

213
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:12,534
There's a small village there,

214
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:16,995
where, if you ask anybody,

215
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:19,845
they know immediately
where Jessy lives.

216
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,390
What about you?
Where do you live?

217
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,573
Isabela.

218
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,733
But I went to highschool in Manila.

219
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:27,806
With my uncle.

220
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,662
Can I hug you?

221
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:38,269
Would I refuse now?
Come here.

222
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:21,524
Here's your fare.

223
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,384
Take care at work, okay?

224
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,250
And don't let go of this.

225
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:27,736
Most of all, don't let them know you're...

226
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:29,249
- you know.
- What?

227
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:30,414
Illegal?

228
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,805
I'm not illegal!
Who are you talking about?

229
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:37,105
Don't be loud.

230
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,413
But, really, thanks.

231
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,961
If it weren't for you,
I'd never get a job,

232
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,368
I'd probably be back home empty-handed.

233
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,258
Don't mention it.

234
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:51,718
You know...

235
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:55,416
I want to visit you

236
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,871
on my days off.

237
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,871
No matter how far,
I'll be there.

238
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,409
You don't need to!

239
00:23:02,662 --> 00:23:04,479
I actually want to do video calls with you.

240
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:06,893
I charge extra for video calls.

241
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:08,027
Really?

242
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,472
I'm kidding!

243
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:11,574
No, really, how much?

244
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:13,134
I'm kidding, you idiot!

245
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,503
You're too serious!

246
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,813
Line up there!

247
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:18,425
I need to give you something.

248
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,920
- Oh! You don't need it anymore?
- Nope.

249
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:23,402
- Got a new one.
- Wow!

250
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:24,553
Give me that.

251
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:30,090
Don't really want to see Hello Kitty
while masturbating.

252
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:38,700
This is it.

253
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:55,980
Take care.

254
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:57,688
You, too.

255
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,613
See you around.

256
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,668
Do you know this address?

257
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:37,398
- Ah, here!
- Here?

258
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:39,621
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

259
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:55,804
- Jessy! How are you?
- I'm good.

260
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,367
I just finished working.

261
00:25:57,392 --> 00:26:00,167
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

262
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:03,462
I get three square meals a day.

263
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,774
They pay me some

264
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,546
so it's fine.

265
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:10,741
By the way,
I'll visit you next weekend!

266
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:15,516
Up to you. I'm always here for you.

267
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:18,789
Take care.

268
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,251
I'll visit on my day off.

269
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,957
I miss you.

270
00:27:07,883 --> 00:27:11,567
Sure thing. I'm always here.

271
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:13,474
I'm here.

272
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:15,784
Show me.

273
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:18,978
There.

274
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:20,557
Move closer.

275
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:23,370
Put your hand in.

276
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:26,089
Where? Down there?

277
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,347
Lower.

278
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:34,692
Lower, lower.

279
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:38,051
Keep going.

280
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:15,168
Busy?

281
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:54,402
The subscriber cannot be reached.
Please try again later.

282
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:02,840
Yes?

283
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,566
You're looking for Jessy?

284
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:07,443
Yes! Do you know where she is?

285
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:11,332
Ah, some guys from
immigration took her.

286
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:13,489
Immigration?

287
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,324
My friend, one more.

288
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,246
Jessy.

289
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:50,933
What the fuck?

290
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,973
Fuck you, Cake.

291
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,186
Thanks, mister.

292
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,037
Uncle Gani?

293
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:55,916
Uncle Gani?

294
00:32:58,168 --> 00:32:59,239
What is it?

295
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,231
Uncle,

296
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,113
it's Pip!

297
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:05,473
Oh!

298
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,612
- Motherfucker!
- How are you?

299
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:08,871
Wait a sec!

300
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:13,500
Pip!

301
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:15,821
What happened to you?

302
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:20,157
Oh, wait, wait.

303
00:33:25,357 --> 00:33:26,438
Well?

304
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,774
You didn't even say you were coming?

305
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,961
Come in, come in.

306
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:34,852
Do your parents even know you're back?

307
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,844
I gotta earn money here in Manila first.

308
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:48,151
What, you think no one will recognize you?

309
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,511
Manila is so small!

310
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,133
Doesn't matter.

311
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:53,001
Wait a minute.

312
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:54,884
Why did you think

313
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:56,711
to come here?

314
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,274
Well.

315
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,003
You're my asshole of an uncle!

316
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:06,852
Oh!

317
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:09,537
Sorry, sorry. Uncle.

318
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:11,188
Fine, you can stay here.

319
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,752
But don't give me a headache.

320
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:14,969
I won't.

321
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:19,657
Your folks might think I'm
letting you get away with shit!

322
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:29,426
Uncle! What's that?

323
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:32,009
Wait, that's mine.

324
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:33,704
So what is it?

325
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,844
Betting App.

326
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:40,037
Betting?

327
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:41,938
Yeah!

328
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:44,069
You've never heard of it?

329
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,407
Online gambling.

330
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:47,369
There's a lot of games here.

331
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:48,680
You have Cara Y Cruz.

332
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:50,433
There's color game,

333
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,118
Tong-its.

334
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:55,039
Oh, it's like... online cockfighting.

335
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:56,610
They have that, too.

336
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,427
Does it pay a lot, uncle?

337
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,648
Pay? This is gambling!

338
00:35:03,149 --> 00:35:08,440
You'll only know how much you get
once you play.

339
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,977
How do you get the money?

340
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:13,141
E-cash.

341
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,695
Online banking.

342
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,406
Hey Pip.

343
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,056
Don't even think about it.

344
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:21,779
You're broke enough as it is.

345
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,672
What's this

346
00:35:24,314 --> 00:35:27,180
"Knock-Out" at Pataya?

347
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:29,062
I can't get in.

348
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:31,367
I haven't tried that yet.

349
00:35:31,392 --> 00:35:36,021
I think you need 100 thousand pesos
credits to get in.

350
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,304
Look at those girls there,

351
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:42,008
the ones manning the rooms.

352
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:44,946
This is just a rumor I heard...

353
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:48,988
Those girls go naked
and give live shows!

354
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,680
But you need
to have 100 thousand pesos.

355
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,944
I don't have that kind of money.

356
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:58,360
And if I did, why would I
waste it on beat-ups and boobs?

357
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:04,328
High, please! High, high!

358
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,953
Shit!

359
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,953
Finally, I'm winning!

360
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,348
Jessy?

361
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:45,088
Wait, I'm confused.

362
00:40:46,115 --> 00:40:48,201
So you're saying that you came here,

363
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:49,686
right here at the precinct,

364
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,502
to look for a missing woman,

365
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:55,562
who isn't actually missing
because you saw her?

366
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,063
Kind of, yeah.

367
00:40:58,184 --> 00:41:00,270
You're saying she was kidnapped?

368
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:03,064
She wasn't kidnapped.
I told you, I just saw her.

369
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,681
Hang on, did you try
all her social media accounts?

370
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:09,117
What about her number? Just text her.

371
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,087
I've done all that.

372
00:41:11,786 --> 00:41:14,400
It's either deactivated,
or just keeps ringing.

373
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:16,189
Maybe you got ghosted.

374
00:41:17,988 --> 00:41:21,392
You know, boy.
I don't think you need our help.

375
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,215
You'll have better luck
pitching to Jessica Soho.

376
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,617
Send your story to their show.

377
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,611
We're busy with actual crimes here.

378
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:33,400
Just last night,
a father stabbed their kid.

379
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:35,617
An addict and a drunkard.

380
00:41:35,715 --> 00:41:38,673
We're not going to
prioritize you over that, sonny.

381
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,041
Got it, sir. Thanks anyway.

382
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,703
Wait.

383
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,717
You said you saw this woman again, right?

384
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:51,752
Where?

385
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,855
Let's hit up DSWD or something.

386
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,242
I feel bad for you.

387
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,853
Don't pity me.

388
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,478
Come on!

389
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,750
Just tell me where you saw her.

390
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:05,852
Online.

391
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:10,681
I thought you said you already
hit up her socials?

392
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:13,235
Online gambling.

393
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:21,345
She ferries players.

394
00:42:23,212 --> 00:42:25,356
How can you tell it's her?

395
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:26,853
I know something about her.

396
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:32,454
Alright. Let's dig into this.

397
00:42:33,263 --> 00:42:34,853
Online gambling, huh?

398
00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:52,481
From what we know,

399
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:55,098
that compound is where
their operations are.

400
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,349
You know someone from the inside?

401
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,663
We've had complaints but,

402
00:43:01,688 --> 00:43:03,210
we don't have any evidence.

403
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:07,418
And their business is registered,
so we can't do anything.

404
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:14,023
Just don't let them know
you got their address from us.

405
00:43:17,068 --> 00:43:18,227
Good day.

406
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:21,379
What is it?

407
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,236
Hello. I wanted to apply for
an IT position for the Pataya App.

408
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:29,806
They said this was
the application center?

409
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:33,219
Someone referred me here,
maybe you know them.

410
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:34,999
Here.

411
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:40,906
Aiko!

412
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:46,484
What?

413
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,632
Why are you showing us
someone's boobs?

414
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:58,421
You think we know
each other's boobs here?

415
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:00,496
No, I mean--

416
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:01,856
Wait! I know her!

417
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,202
Really?

418
00:44:03,656 --> 00:44:06,616
Wait! Kate! Kate!

419
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:10,089
Girl with a birthmark
on her boob, this guy's asking.

420
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,784
Me? Are you looking for me?

421
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,459
Sorry.

422
00:44:44,707 --> 00:44:45,875
I didn't mean to...

423
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,078
stare.

424
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:51,500
My cellphone.

425
00:44:55,134 --> 00:44:56,636
Alright, you guys go upstairs.

426
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:17,991
Okay, so now that you've
seen me, what do you want?

427
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:23,663
Sorry. I was just looking for a woman

428
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,723
with a birthmark on her chest.

429
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:27,550
It looks like a heart, like yours.

430
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:34,822
When I saw you on the app,
I thought I found her.

431
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:41,859
And now you know that it's not me,
why are you still here?

432
00:45:42,022 --> 00:45:45,730
Well, I saw you and thought...

433
00:45:47,152 --> 00:45:49,078
maybe we could be friends.

434
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:52,355
Wow, that's some pick-up line.

435
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,585
How many girls have you used it on?

436
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,285
It's not a pick-up line.

437
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,699
I'm just being honest.

438
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:03,379
Here.

439
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:07,293
Oh shit, it's real.

440
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,879
But that's not me.

441
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:13,246
Is she your girlfriend?

442
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,975
Well, our birthmarks are different.

443
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,801
Hers is shaped like a heart.
Mine is...

444
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:26,855
shaped like a dong.

445
00:46:28,394 --> 00:46:29,812
Hey, I'm proud of it!

446
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,278
It doesn't grow when you caress it, though.

447
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:36,219
I'm Kate.

448
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,469
Pip.

449
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,910
Ah, Kate!

450
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:48,012
Could I have your number?

451
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,600
I'm not easy to get, but...

452
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:51,851
if...

453
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:55,379
you're really interested,
you can visit later.

454
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:59,379
You already know where we live.

455
00:47:33,105 --> 00:47:34,436
Shit.

456
00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:42,677
Pip, you fucking moron!

457
00:47:43,356 --> 00:47:45,138
Lock your damn door!

458
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,692
Pervert!

459
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:50,910
Goddamn it!

460
00:48:05,825 --> 00:48:07,618
- Uncle!
- Let's eat.

461
00:48:08,523 --> 00:48:10,043
Sorry about last night.

462
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:15,496
Can we not talk about that shit?

463
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,153
I might lose my appetite.

464
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:18,443
Sorry, uncle.

465
00:48:25,386 --> 00:48:27,180
How's the job hunt going?

466
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:30,391
It's going.

467
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,715
Oh, your mom called.

468
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:43,446
She's asking for money.

469
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,613
Said she'll pay me back
when you've sent them some.

470
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:49,843
Alright, I'll take care of it.

471
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,374
Go find some work first you dumbass,

472
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:56,918
so you can actually send something.

473
00:48:57,335 --> 00:49:00,004
Stop jacking off!

474
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:36,749
Hi!

475
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:39,752
What are you here for?

476
00:49:40,628 --> 00:49:42,046
I'm waiting for Kate.

477
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,798
Are you her boyfriend?

478
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,442
No, just a friend.

479
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:47,903
Fubu?

480
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:50,653
What's Fubu?

481
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:53,106
Nevermind.

482
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:56,258
Do you know who I am?

483
00:49:57,019 --> 00:49:59,772
Has Kate told you about me?

484
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:00,957
No.

485
00:50:00,982 --> 00:50:03,207
Are you one of the other girls?

486
00:50:05,528 --> 00:50:06,487
Me?

487
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:12,118
I know we're close in age,

488
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:14,870
but,

489
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,515
I assure you,

490
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,000
we work in different departments.

491
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,462
Sorry, ma'am, but who are you?

492
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:25,223
Nina.

493
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:29,707
I'm one of the operators here.

494
00:50:30,037 --> 00:50:34,361
I take care of the girls.

495
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,879
So tell me. What do you want from Kate?

496
00:50:39,442 --> 00:50:41,236
I just want to be friends.

497
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,978
Don't take me for a fool, boy.

498
00:50:44,236 --> 00:50:47,030
I know that leads to fucking in the end!

499
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:49,439
I don't have a problem with that.

500
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:52,116
But,

501
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,452
what work do you do?

502
00:50:55,181 --> 00:50:58,793
Don't tell me my girl
has to feed you, too?

503
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:02,418
Honestly, I'm still looking for work.

504
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:06,448
I'm supposed to be in Thailand. OFW.
But I got scammed.

505
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:12,136
What can you do?

506
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,645
Plenty.

507
00:51:24,573 --> 00:51:27,418
Call me if you can't find anything.

508
00:51:29,278 --> 00:51:30,946
Maybe I'll have something for you.

509
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:33,616
Thanks.

510
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,243
Take care, you two.

511
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:38,979
I guess you've met my boss!

512
00:51:41,624 --> 00:51:43,761
Don't get knocked up, okay?

513
00:51:43,786 --> 00:51:45,395
I'll go now.

514
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,838
Whoever you're thinking of,

515
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:26,473
I'm the one here now.

516
00:55:52,202 --> 00:55:53,288
Pip.

517
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:55,344
Wake up.

518
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:57,391
We still have work.

519
00:55:57,836 --> 00:56:02,938
Huh? Work? What time?

520
00:56:07,437 --> 00:56:08,771
It's nine o'clock.

521
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,789
I guess you had fun last night!

522
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:19,054
Kate.

523
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:21,244
What is it?

524
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:22,640
Sorry.

525
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,282
For what?

526
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,316
For last night.

527
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:31,967
I was hammered last night.

528
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:35,455
I don't really have sex with others.

529
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:38,600
Okay... why are you explaining this?

530
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:40,476
I want it to be... just us.

531
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,164
I don't want you to
think differently of me.

532
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:44,594
That's alright.

533
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:48,334
I mean, just because
you have sex with others

534
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:50,055
doesn't mean you love them, right?

535
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:53,413
But I'm only after you.

536
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,831
You know what, I'll tell you.

537
00:56:58,266 --> 00:57:01,418
If we do end up being a thing,
I'm cool if you have sex with others.

538
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:06,698
I know the girls here
will take care of you.

539
00:57:07,513 --> 00:57:11,225
And I know the girls who
will have sex with you anyway.

540
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,618
- Right, ladies?
- Of course.

541
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:15,568
Are you serious?

542
00:57:17,556 --> 00:57:18,807
Do I look like I'm kidding?

543
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:24,462
I don't know.

544
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:27,749
I've never met anyone like you.

545
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,614
Get used to it.

546
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,343
Go on, I have work to do.

547
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:45,906
There's your kid.

548
01:00:03,042 --> 01:00:04,741
You piece of shit!

549
01:00:05,437 --> 01:00:06,811
Sixta, that's enough!

550
01:00:08,616 --> 01:00:09,647
Pip!

551
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:11,902
You think you can lie to me?

552
01:00:12,717 --> 01:00:15,045
I thought you were in Thailand!

553
01:00:15,413 --> 01:00:18,349
Where did you come from?
Did you actually go to Thailand?

554
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,035
The agency was fake.

555
01:00:22,387 --> 01:00:23,972
There was nothing for me there.

556
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:26,660
When did you come home?

557
01:00:28,263 --> 01:00:29,918
Are you trying to make fools out of us?

558
01:00:29,943 --> 01:00:31,085
No.

559
01:00:33,113 --> 01:00:34,692
I'm really not, mom.

560
01:00:34,989 --> 01:00:37,884
Then you should have just come home!

561
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:40,100
Why didn't you tell me anything?

562
01:00:40,226 --> 01:00:43,032
I don't know what
you're doing with your life

563
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:44,755
and with ours!

564
01:00:45,427 --> 01:00:48,480
I thought you said
you were going to help?

565
01:00:48,505 --> 01:00:50,513
But here you are wasting your life away,

566
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:53,233
like you don't have a family!

567
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,161
Your father is old!

568
01:00:58,371 --> 01:00:59,481
Mom.

569
01:01:01,434 --> 01:01:02,575
Don't worry.

570
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:05,012
I found work.

571
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:09,874
What is it?

572
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,089
Look at you. All that bravado.

573
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:16,653
Now you're begging.

574
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:19,287
What do you have for me?

575
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:22,292
Do you think you get to choose?

576
01:01:22,317 --> 01:01:24,656
I thought you said
you had plenty of talents,

577
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,100
and you're up for anything?

578
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:30,295
I don't know if I can do sex work.

579
01:01:30,971 --> 01:01:33,763
Why would you think that?

580
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:35,708
It's getting late.

581
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:41,281
Well. Everyone who works
sells their body in a way.

582
01:01:41,987 --> 01:01:45,657
Chefs get wounded.

583
01:01:46,145 --> 01:01:51,192
Call center agents develop
hypertension from stress.

584
01:01:52,774 --> 01:01:57,487
You can't get anywhere
without selling your body.

585
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:03,003
So what is it then?
Am I gonna be a call boy?

586
01:02:04,451 --> 01:02:05,633
No.

587
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:07,452
Then what?

588
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,541
No more questions.

589
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:18,119
Where are we going?

590
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,599
Are you deaf?
Didn't I say no more questions?

591
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:28,627
You'll have to excuse me,
I've had bad experiences on narrow alleys.

592
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:38,599
Welcome to your new office.

593
01:02:42,406 --> 01:02:43,692
What is this?

594
01:02:44,085 --> 01:02:46,489
This is Patayan (To the Death).

595
01:02:49,692 --> 01:02:52,299
I don't like this shit.

596
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:58,400
I thought you could do lots of things?

597
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,311
But I'm not a boxer.

598
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,223
You just need to fight.

599
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:08,946
Haven't you gotten into fistfghts
when you were younger?

600
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:14,041
Sorry, Nina, I can't do this.

601
01:03:14,587 --> 01:03:20,213
Even if I tell you 80 thousand is the
lowest you can get when you lose?

602
01:03:20,439 --> 01:03:24,637
Obviously, it's bigger if you win.

603
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:30,227
There's no age limit,

604
01:03:30,252 --> 01:03:34,488
no weight divisions. Just fight.

605
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:37,279
But how do you earn from this?

606
01:03:38,813 --> 01:03:40,400
You see this?

607
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:49,013
This match right now
has a total bet of eight million.

608
01:03:50,037 --> 01:03:52,665
And that isn't a big fight.

609
01:03:53,034 --> 01:03:57,959
It's just like online cockfighting,
but with people.

610
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,528
But unlike cockfighting,

611
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:07,398
here, entertainment is important.

612
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:13,397
The audience wants blood and broken bones.

613
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:18,075
No gloves, no safety.

614
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:27,214
Our audience are businessmen. Politicians.

615
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:30,099
They're sick and tired of their safe lives.

616
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:35,171
Every now and then,
to release their animal instinct,

617
01:04:35,196 --> 01:04:38,251
they want to participate
in something risky.

618
01:04:38,276 --> 01:04:40,152
Violence.

619
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:44,839
Stuff they can't experience
from their penthouse condominiums.

620
01:04:44,864 --> 01:04:48,918
We had one boxer
who got so beat up,

621
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:53,199
he ended up with a
hole in his lungs. Dead.

622
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:58,764
But because the fight was good,
one of our high betters took pity on him.

623
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:03,054
They added an extra 50 thousand
as an offering to the family.

624
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:04,638
Not a bad deal.

625
01:05:04,663 --> 01:05:08,238
"Not a bad deal"? These are
people's lives on the line.

626
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:13,112
If he were alive, where would
he get 50 thousand?

627
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:18,912
I'm pretty sure he'd rather die for it.

628
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,149
Thank you.

629
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,961
Take care, you two.

630
01:06:04,883 --> 01:06:07,786
Hey, why didn't you say
you were with Miss Nina?

631
01:06:10,025 --> 01:06:11,036
Come on.

632
01:06:11,628 --> 01:06:14,351
Where did you go,
why didn't you tell me?

633
01:06:17,415 --> 01:06:19,459
I just asked her for work.

634
01:06:22,476 --> 01:06:23,620
Okay. It's cool.

635
01:06:24,739 --> 01:06:26,198
You just forgot to mention.

636
01:06:28,773 --> 01:06:30,650
Hey, I'm not jealous, okay!

637
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:34,782
What?

638
01:06:36,588 --> 01:06:37,255
Nothing.

639
01:06:38,526 --> 01:06:39,485
You're so cute.

640
01:06:40,279 --> 01:06:43,491
Yuck! What's wrong with you? Move.

641
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,753
Hey, by the way...

642
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:50,607
what kind of work
did Miss Nina offer?

643
01:06:51,482 --> 01:06:52,524
Knock-Out.

644
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:54,639
What do you think?

645
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:56,834
Should I take it?

646
01:07:00,337 --> 01:07:01,297
Up to you.

647
01:07:02,482 --> 01:07:03,858
If you think you can take it.

648
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:08,313
Do you have other options?

649
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:14,697
There's your answer.

650
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,881
This used to be a warehouse.
Closed because of the pandemic.

651
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:35,019
You can use anything you like here.

652
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:39,649
Shower and lockers at the back.

653
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:46,156
That's Anjo. He's one
of the best boxers here.

654
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,699
Last night he won 250 thousand.

655
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:52,967
Talk to him, maybe he'll give you tips.

656
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,836
Don't be fussy.

657
01:09:46,398 --> 01:09:48,858
Here, water.

658
01:09:56,937 --> 01:09:59,339
Let's eat!

659
01:12:21,495 --> 01:12:22,495
Kate!

660
01:12:23,076 --> 01:12:24,076
Kate!

661
01:12:25,077 --> 01:12:26,077
Kate!

662
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,761
Kate!

663
01:12:29,113 --> 01:12:30,220
Kate!

664
01:12:31,269 --> 01:12:33,104
- Kate, let me explain!
- Let go of me!

665
01:12:33,129 --> 01:12:34,333
What's your problem?

666
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,337
What?

667
01:12:37,362 --> 01:12:39,980
I thought you said it's cool.

668
01:12:40,005 --> 01:12:41,436
You said that.

669
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:44,548
It's fine if it's with someone
you know, hell, that's even better.

670
01:12:44,795 --> 01:12:46,463
I thought it was okay.

671
01:12:47,799 --> 01:12:49,217
I really did.

672
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,887
But when I saw you
with Nina, it felt different.

673
01:12:58,433 --> 01:13:00,853
This setup used to be fine
with my exes, I was okay with it.

674
01:13:00,878 --> 01:13:02,713
I didn't have a problem, but,

675
01:13:04,655 --> 01:13:05,948
I don't know.

676
01:13:07,313 --> 01:13:08,356
I don't know anymore.

677
01:13:11,589 --> 01:13:12,600
What is it?

678
01:13:12,731 --> 01:13:13,764
Just wait.

679
01:13:17,466 --> 01:13:19,093
I have something to confess.

680
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:23,252
I just want to know if
Jessy is the girl from the app.

681
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:29,418
And I'm telling you,
you can be part of our operation!

682
01:13:29,443 --> 01:13:30,694
As an informant.

683
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:34,503
Get in, know how things work.

684
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,969
Use that lady friend you met.

685
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,639
As soon as when we have enough evidence--

686
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,628
if there's prostitution, or
anything illegal associated with

687
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,297
that online gambling,
then we'll take them to court.

688
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:49,184
Of course, you'll get a reward.

689
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,347
It's not much, but it'll help.

690
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:55,472
It'll help your life with
that woman you're looking for.

691
01:13:57,018 --> 01:13:58,436
I said yes.

692
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,002
Fuck you!

693
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:03,284
Listen to me.

694
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:05,863
I'm falling for you.

695
01:14:06,854 --> 01:14:07,855
Sorry I didn't tell you.

696
01:14:10,889 --> 01:14:13,517
Is that from a script the
police told you to say?

697
01:14:23,955 --> 01:14:25,149
I love you.

698
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:41,614
Here's your coffee.

699
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,210
Good morning.

700
01:14:52,586 --> 01:14:53,420
Yes?

701
01:14:54,096 --> 01:14:55,389
Is Kate there?

702
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:57,497
Come in.

703
01:14:57,533 --> 01:14:58,284
Thanks.

704
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:59,621
Not here.

705
01:15:00,403 --> 01:15:01,946
She's not here.

706
01:15:01,971 --> 01:15:04,598
We don't know where she is.
She didn't come home.

707
01:15:04,858 --> 01:15:05,776
Did she run away?

708
01:15:06,453 --> 01:15:11,124
She left her things but
she didn't say she was leaving.

709
01:15:11,919 --> 01:15:13,587
What happened?

710
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,975
Sorry for the trouble. Sorry.

711
01:15:27,749 --> 01:15:30,576
Chief. Can we talk?

712
01:15:30,981 --> 01:15:32,027
About what?

713
01:15:32,649 --> 01:15:33,691
The... you know...

714
01:15:36,262 --> 01:15:37,555
Okay, let's talk there.

715
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:53,963
What's up?

716
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,677
Chief.

717
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:59,439
I can't do what you want.

718
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:01,497
I'm going crazy.

719
01:16:01,741 --> 01:16:06,204
Even Kate left me!
No one knows where she is!

720
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:07,735
She's missing?

721
01:16:09,013 --> 01:16:10,556
What makes you say she left you?

722
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,143
She's part of a gambling circle.

723
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:16,840
Anything could have happened to her.

724
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:20,046
Like?

725
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,598
I really don't want to say but...

726
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:26,252
she could have been kidnapped?

727
01:16:27,204 --> 01:16:29,298
Killed? Beaten up?

728
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,343
What's the last thing you did with her?

729
01:16:35,497 --> 01:16:36,911
We fought.

730
01:16:40,252 --> 01:16:42,212
I told her about the operation.

731
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:43,820
You fucking moron!

732
01:16:44,943 --> 01:16:47,224
Don't you know what confidential means?

733
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:48,937
I trust Kate!

734
01:16:49,075 --> 01:16:50,243
And now she's missing!

735
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:55,357
What if she ran to her bosses?

736
01:16:56,803 --> 01:16:58,886
What if you're next?

737
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:00,689
And you go missing, too?

738
01:17:02,559 --> 01:17:04,603
Go on, leave, we're not gonna stop you.

739
01:17:05,105 --> 01:17:08,149
But I can't guarantee that
you'll be safe if something happens.

740
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:19,778
What do I need to do?

741
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:23,851
Just follow our instructions.

742
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,809
And I'll make sure you're safe.

743
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,238
Deal?

744
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,863
Can we talk?

745
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,019
Why haven't you answered my texts?

746
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:36,210
I'll fight again.

747
01:19:37,429 --> 01:19:39,139
I gave your slot away.

748
01:19:39,353 --> 01:19:41,105
To who?

749
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:45,026
Chikoy.

750
01:19:45,783 --> 01:19:48,221
He's gonna fight Anjo.

751
01:19:48,391 --> 01:19:49,550
Anjo?

752
01:19:49,633 --> 01:19:51,218
What can he do against Anjo?

753
01:19:52,131 --> 01:19:54,425
Anjo will slaughter him!
Take him out!

754
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,642
Why don't you remove him instead?

755
01:19:58,393 --> 01:19:59,757
Then.

756
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,380
Take him out.

757
01:20:31,908 --> 01:20:35,275
Any news? Did you get a fight?

758
01:20:35,484 --> 01:20:38,851
They didn't give it to me,
but I have a plan.

759
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:42,490
Chief. The fight is staged.

760
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:46,191
I'll place my life on your hands.

761
01:20:47,722 --> 01:20:50,516
Yeah, just calm down.
We'll take care of you.

762
01:20:51,573 --> 01:20:52,741
Don't worry.

763
01:20:53,343 --> 01:20:54,895
Get into the fight.

764
01:20:55,421 --> 01:20:58,215
Before the three rounds are over,
we'll raid the place.

765
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:10,763
We've gotten a number
of complaints about you.

766
01:22:12,034 --> 01:22:14,105
But you're a legit business, right?

767
01:22:14,718 --> 01:22:17,513
You have your papers,
so we won't take a swing at you.

768
01:22:19,112 --> 01:22:21,167
So what do you need from us?

769
01:22:21,355 --> 01:22:23,626
Does Boss Paps know about this?

770
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:25,757
We just want to partner up with you.

771
01:22:26,168 --> 01:22:27,313
Partner?

772
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:29,155
How?

773
01:22:29,322 --> 01:22:30,837
We're not POGO.

774
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:34,421
You wanna keep raking in cash,
don't you? So do we.

775
01:22:35,662 --> 01:22:39,082
We've thought of a market
you haven't tapped into yet.

776
01:22:39,964 --> 01:22:43,051
Live shows and underground boxing.

777
01:22:43,349 --> 01:22:45,669
But this isn't for your small fish.

778
01:22:46,374 --> 01:22:49,584
We'll just use the app
and then we'll split the spoils.

779
01:22:49,956 --> 01:22:52,083
Where would we get these boxers?

780
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:55,447
Who wants to bet on something
that's underground?

781
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:57,411
We don't need to find a fighter!

782
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:03,043
Just people who can fight
and are desperate for money.

783
01:23:03,105 --> 01:23:04,857
Isn't that more exciting?

784
01:23:05,476 --> 01:23:07,781
Just like the battle of YouTubers!

785
01:23:08,134 --> 01:23:09,783
You can use your girls, too.

786
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,840
What do you mean?

787
01:23:14,133 --> 01:23:17,276
They can lure in men
to join the betting app.

788
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:20,704
Hold on,

789
01:23:21,235 --> 01:23:22,903
I'm a little confused.

790
01:23:23,997 --> 01:23:25,969
Why do you need to do this?

791
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:29,228
We're legal! Legal!

792
01:23:29,454 --> 01:23:33,384
Let's just say that we need
to make a little revenue.

793
01:23:33,774 --> 01:23:37,211
It's for the politicians
running next election.

794
01:23:37,564 --> 01:23:40,856
It's 2025. How time flies, right?

795
01:23:41,943 --> 01:23:45,113
No. I don't agree to this, alright?

796
01:23:45,511 --> 01:23:46,762
I don't want this kind of trouble.

797
01:23:47,227 --> 01:23:48,437
That's the wrong answer.

798
01:23:48,887 --> 01:23:51,306
We'll put you through
something much worse

799
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:53,041
if you don't agree to this.

800
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,682
Come on!

801
01:23:56,992 --> 01:23:59,584
Want the money, or not?

802
01:24:03,057 --> 01:24:06,830
Thanks for your cooperation.
You won't regret it.

803
01:24:07,536 --> 01:24:11,012
Thanks for your help finding Jessy.

804
01:24:26,134 --> 01:24:29,372
Hello, Nina? Good afternoon, how are you?

805
01:24:31,056 --> 01:24:32,683
Yes, I have a prospect for you.

806
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:39,568
Hello, sis?

807
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:41,284
Yeah?

808
01:24:42,387 --> 01:24:44,204
Yeah, I'll take care of it,
I'll send money.

809
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:45,909
100 thousand minimum.

810
01:24:47,519 --> 01:24:49,563
I'll take care of it, sis,
you'll have it soon.

811
01:24:50,306 --> 01:24:51,205
Okay?

812
01:25:01,094 --> 01:25:04,080
Fuck, man, sorry about this,
I need this fight.

813
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:39,866
Give me the fight.

814
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:43,860
Please.

815
01:25:44,193 --> 01:25:45,402
Give the fight to me.

816
01:25:46,612 --> 01:25:48,715
You really took it seriously.

817
01:25:48,771 --> 01:25:49,987
All right.

818
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:51,610
It's yours.

819
01:25:52,643 --> 01:25:54,979
But this fight is special.

820
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:56,960
What?

821
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,389
What do you mean?

822
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:00,469
Win or lose...

823
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:06,677
100 thousand
is the lowest you'll get.

824
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:08,137
But...

825
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:13,524
you can get as much
as 500 thousand.

826
01:26:15,226 --> 01:26:17,508
Are you going to fight again?

827
01:26:19,433 --> 01:26:21,187
What's the special arrangement?

828
01:26:23,572 --> 01:26:26,215
You need to lose on purpose.

829
01:26:28,871 --> 01:26:30,039
What?

830
01:26:30,663 --> 01:26:32,081
Why would I do that?

831
01:26:36,034 --> 01:26:36,993
Okay.

832
01:26:38,103 --> 01:26:41,144
I'll tell you since I trust you,

833
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:47,459
we have a bettor who's
a businessman. Very wealthy!

834
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:49,954
But...

835
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:54,626
he plans to run in the next election.

836
01:26:55,807 --> 01:27:02,367
He needs funds, and he needs
to win, so he can protect us.

837
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:08,900
So the fight is staged.
Do you consent?

838
01:27:13,599 --> 01:27:15,309
Am I up against Anjo?

839
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,360
Yes.

840
01:27:19,645 --> 01:27:21,480
Is there a problem?

841
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:56,224
Goddamn you, Pip, what
did you do to my brother?

842
01:29:56,499 --> 01:30:01,001
Chikoy just wanted to help
send our siblings to school!

843
01:30:02,344 --> 01:30:04,589
and you almost beat him to death?

844
01:30:06,231 --> 01:30:09,401
He'd be in bigger trouble
if he continued the fight.

845
01:30:12,758 --> 01:30:13,843
Where did you go?

846
01:30:14,384 --> 01:30:15,869
- What happened to you?
- Listen very carefully!

847
01:30:15,894 --> 01:30:17,574
I don't have much time.

848
01:30:17,599 --> 01:30:18,879
Kate, what do you mean?

849
01:30:19,097 --> 01:30:20,348
- Why are you running out of time?
- Just listen to me, please!

850
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:23,977
- The fuck happened to you?
- Just listen to me, please!

851
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:26,698
That policeman S.E. Publito guy--

852
01:30:27,733 --> 01:30:30,942
He's a pawn and in cahoots
with that fucking Nina!

853
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:34,137
They're using you as bait, Pip!
You're bait!

854
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:38,074
- Bait? Being baited the fuck where?
- Yes!

855
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:43,112
If you lose the fight with Anjo on purpose,
that means one thing.

856
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:46,399
They'll beat the shit out of you!

857
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:51,754
They'll beat you until you're dead
or bedridden for life!

858
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:55,583
What the hell are you saying? Kate?

859
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:59,746
That's what they're paying
for in large fights.

860
01:31:01,059 --> 01:31:04,584
And Anjo never plays in the small ones.

861
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:14,802
Please, if you survive this fight,
just let me know.

862
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:21,017
This is the address. Find me.

863
01:31:26,121 --> 01:31:27,289
Kate, pick up.

864
01:31:28,843 --> 01:31:32,774
Where are you?
Where are we meeting?

865
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:38,826
Kate? Kate?

866
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:40,995
Damn it!

867
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,049
Bro, good morning.

868
01:31:57,386 --> 01:31:58,846
Sir, please place your stuff here.

869
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,640
I think that Buddhist saying got
it wrong when they said that

870
01:34:05,665 --> 01:34:08,167
they should kill the illusion
of Buddha before them.

871
01:34:08,904 --> 01:34:10,072
Because, I'm...

872
01:34:10,539 --> 01:34:12,207
I'm willing to kill

873
01:34:12,232 --> 01:34:15,527
just to keep the most
beautiful illusion I have.
