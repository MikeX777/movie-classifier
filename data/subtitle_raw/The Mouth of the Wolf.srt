How are you, Father Serafino?

171
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,873
It helped me when I came out of jail
Pianosa, some years ago.

172
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,075
Pippo's son: "Lighters, apparatus,
aerosols, hand grenades ...".

173
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,315
Do you remember the little Enzo?

174
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,072
The son of that Pippo that
sold cigarettes ...

175
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,150
I went to greet you, Father.

176
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,871
I'm in trouble.

177
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,233
I'm too young to retire,
too old to work. Where am I?

178
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,915
What should I do?
Is going to steal? Kidnapping ¿?

179
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,917
To shoot back to the police? Are you shooting
again to end my days in jail?

180

- What health for whom? Do you pay?
- Yes, do not worry.

201
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,830
- To your health, nothing. You have not paid.
- Here's to your health.

202
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,492
- Pants pay!
- He says he pays.

203
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,032
- To me! A bottle of champagne.
- I should!

204
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,630
- Want to bet?
- No. You're gonna lose.

205
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,789
It was a round,
Do you want to offer!

206
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,952
He touched my ass!

207
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,357
No, I pondered the situation
economy.

208

Do not bother! I am very hot.

209
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,715
Break my balls!

210
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,789
I pierced my eyes!
Do not start again.

211
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,819
I want to ask a question.

212
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,471
Where fulfilled your worth?
No, seriously.

213
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,513
Where was what? Does the jail?

214
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,995
What the fuck do you care where
I turned my grief?

215
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,714
- Were you in jail?
- Ever ...

216
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,151
And now, chupámela!
What the fuck are you looking at me?

217
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,396
I asked, is all.

218
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,673
Go ask the police!
They will tell you where I turned off!

219
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,916
They have a good record.

220
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,193
Claudio, do you serve a beer?

221
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,833
A Turbo.

222
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,914
- A Bourbon?
- A Turbo!

223
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,599
Understood bourbon,
as whiskey.

224
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,995
A Tuborg!

225
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,074
- I hate that.
- I am deaf.

226
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,113
Man, I wash your head?

227
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,630
- Do not touch!
- Stop it. What are you doing?

228
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,558
A wash!

229
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,275
I will make one.
A kick in the ass!

230
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,709
Then, play the juke-box.

231
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,879
You put a disc and I sing.
The juke-box!

232
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,157
Tell me what you want to hear ...

233
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,989
... and I get to the stage.
And I sing.

234
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,554
- Do you sing?
- I sing!

235
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,198
<i> - I sing!
- It is not the same as you. </ I>

Oh, Richard!

00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,517
- Pausini? No, Cocciante.
- Exactly.

239
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,356
It Cocciante, I'm sure.

240
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,950
- For, Enzo!
- Bravo!

241
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,316
I put the horns
in my nose!

242
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,313
- First me, then she.
- Do we stop?

243
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,075
Do not forgive this. I
you loved me.

244
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,153
- You're a friend!
- You betrayed me!

245
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,919
Coward!

246
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,668
You is friendship,
with her is love.

247
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,394
- You betrayed me! Before you kissed me!
- Who do you tell?

248
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,354
- Yes, for the film, to the scene.
- Be careful, huh?

249
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,790
She's a friend.
To you, I love you.

250
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,514
Right now, he kissed me.

251
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,438
You is love. With it is friendship,
40 years.

252
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,074
She is the wife of Mimmo,
of Piccadilly.

253
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,953
- I was the wife of Mimmo.
- Yes, he died.

It is not true what he said.

283
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,591
I was in prison in

284
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,998
... because before I got high.

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,116

... of despair.

287
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,192
He sent me almost five grams
of heroin a day.

288
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,279
It was really a scrap.

289
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,592
Until a supervisor told me:

290
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,715
''Mary, there is a Sicilian boy
upstairs ...

291
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,992
... that can give you cigarettes ...

292
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,953
... if you shorten the pants. "

293
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,958
As I had nothing
at all, ...

294
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,391
... I have a package suited
of cigarettes.

295
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,192
And I agreed.

296
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,276
Then I brought the pants
and I fixed it.

297
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,672
And when I finished ...

298
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,310
... I went to the floor where he was.

299
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,433
The cell and the door was closed,
then scrimmage.

300
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,514
The peephole opens soon ...

301
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,357
... and I see it in all its glory.

302
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,994
Wearing shorts ...

303
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,677
... and it was all ...
Long sport.

304
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,998
He had a magnificent physique
at that time.

305
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,716
I was struck by her composure, ...

306
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,070
... for its impressive beauty.

307
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,911
But at the same time,
was intimidated ...

308
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,796
... by air so rude.

309
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,631
I expected nothing at all.

310
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,354
I was almost intimidated,
could hardly speak.

311
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,117
And he ... ''Thanks.''
And he gave me cigarettes.

312
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,110
He said:''If you
sending poems, ...

313
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,509
... I can do you translate?''

314
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,038
In short, it was an excuse
to approach me.

315
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,232
Seeing that I was alone, ...

316
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,991
... I was happy
to make friends.

317
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,715
So I get these letters, ...

318
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,869
... to translate these poems,
and I took them in my cell.

319
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,435
Thus began.

320
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,114
But I was a little reserved, ...

321
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,232
... I kept my distance.

322
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,429
Until one morning when I went
library section ...

323
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,829
... I had to go through a broker
to get to the library.

324
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,798
I walk into the library, ...

325
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,032
... and when I leave the door
bookstore, I find it before me.

326
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,597
He grabs my hand ...

327
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,914
... give me a kiss on the lips, ...

328
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,430
... so ... I was shocked.

329
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,633
And that was the beginning
of our history.

330
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,509
As soon as we could, we were
during the hour ride.

331
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,279
It was the only one speaking.

332
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,396
He, too, had not a penny ...

333
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,798
... but he was gifted with his hands.
Did you know ...

334
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,593
With the matches, was
lighters, ...

335
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,197
... small frames. Very beautiful things.

336
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,837
Those items manufactured
exchanged ...

337
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,994
Over the supervisors,
was supplied ...

338
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,988
... cans of tomatoes,
peas, pasta.

339
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,157
With it, we've never gone hungry
in my cell.

340
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,148
I was with two other
transsexuals.

341
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,478
We were separated from the others.

342
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,035
I saw it during the daily walk.

343
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,030
I spent my time to ride
in your company.

344
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,038
As we were in two
different cells, ...

345
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,870
... took place in my apartment,
front of my cell.

346
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,554
In this way, we could talk.

347
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,357
To achieve this, as
I could not scream ...

348
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,033
... taught me a dumb alphabet.

349
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,993
I learned little by little, ...

350
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,988
... We communicated through
this alphabet.

351
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,638
I do not know.

352
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,109
It is he who ... communicated
that way.

353
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,555
Honestly, ...

354
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,229
... I spent four months ...
It may sound absurd ...

355
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,796
... but those four months
were wonderful.

356
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,470
I'm not saying they have been
the best of my life ...

357
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,309
... but those four months
were exceptional.

358
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,080
This is absurd since
was in jail.

359
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,637
But honestly, for
those four months, ...

360
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,469
... I got everything you could want ...

361
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,036
... tenderness and understanding.

362
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,316
All the love I sought,
I met him.

363
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:52,310
He showed me and I spent
four wonderful months.

364
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,676
This is how our story
began.

365
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,318
And it takes twenty years.

366
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,398
Twenty years have passed since
we're together.

367
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,390
These are the four best
months of your life.

368
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,115
I owe you the best fourteen
years of my life!

369
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,388
He was sentenced to
almost ten years.

370
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,750
But I waited.

371
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,552
Meanwhile, I went from
one prison to another ...

372
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,558
... to see him almost every month.

373
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,594
But it's ...

374
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,116
First, it's like
I stopped using drugs ...

375
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,071
... because when I met him ...

376
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,790
... No one had visited ...

377
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,118
... neither my family nor my friends
ones.

378
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,518
He had tried to give me advice:

379
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,235
''For, you should stop
take drugs. "

380
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,389
"Step into the wonderful person
you were. "

381
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,435
I said "Yes, yes," but not
had the strength.

382
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,513
- Meanwhile he ...
- Thanks to my strength.

383
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,871
... with her tenderness, her character, ...

384
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,551
... its hardness, but also
with its sweetness, ...

385
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,918
... gave me the strength to have
a purpose.

386
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,911
Even to wait ten years.

387
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,914
I said, I see ...

388
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,910
... I have to go far,
how far we can go.

389
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,997
It has almost become a target
in my life.

390
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,274
- And twenty years later, we're here.
- We did it!

391
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,558
Not without difficulty, because ...

392
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,072
... life is not only difficult in prison
even in prison is easy because ...

393
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,756
... the only problem that exists,
is eating and sleeping.

394
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,956
And make the time pass.

395
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,994
What is ugly in life ...

396
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,311
... are all problems
to be faced to live.

397
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,917
- There is something else, my love.
- What?

398
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,071
¿I can say something?

399
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,153
The guards who brought the food ...

400
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,515
... did not like homosexuals.
The mistreated.

401
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,111
One day, I called one. Peace to his soul,
because they died.

402
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,876
I said,''you bring to eat
to this cell.

403
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,753
"If you touch Mary, I play to me, and
're dead. "

404
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,116
- Who do you bother then? No one.
- It's true.

405
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,314
You belong to Enzo and nobody bothered
for a long time.

406
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,754
Thirty people lay alone for
When walking, does not it?

407
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,272
Yes, indeed.

408
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,152
And I broke a leather ball
in the face. He blew his head.

409
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,510
Is not it true?

410
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,230
This boy was the goalkeeper.
I said, "Forward."

411
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,795
I threw a pitch and
I broke the ball.

412
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,992
- It's true.
- She confirms it.

413
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,432
And woe to those that touch!
Neither the guards was allowed.

414
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,156
One night, a guard put chile
under the nose.

415
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,594
I said, "Guard, come here a
moment ... Do you see?

416
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,793
If you allow it once again, I cut
the head. I stab with or without uniform. "

417
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,798
I had shit to lose.
Or not?

418
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,910
It's true.

419
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,148
We were so close to both ...

420
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,274
... which was isolated from all ...

421
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,356
- Of all the rest of the band!
- In the entire section.

422
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,791
They were afraid of me. We were
time of thirty to ride ...

423
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,356
... and nobody said a word wrong.

424
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,676
Otherwise, they are
was seen.

425
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,558
All detainees!

426
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,199
She and I both are
dominant.

427
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,912
She dominates me and I domain.
But she's the one going.

428
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,030
Only when I raise my voice,
all is well. Is repeated.

429
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,880
Not because I want to dominate.

430
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,515
Because we understand!
We are old now.

431
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,595
What is the song of the old?

432
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,633
"Both of us must do one."

433
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,114
No, the beginning.

434
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,836
No, better not
sing it now.

435
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,592
Dila, I sing.

436
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,510
In any case, not dominate.
We know, that's all.

437
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,669
Both <i>, we must make one. </ i>

438
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,716
We consoled ourselves <i> old and happy. </ i>
