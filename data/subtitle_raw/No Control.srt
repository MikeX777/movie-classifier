1
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:19,404
NO CONTROL

2
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,878
<i>Danilo Porto, after years
of promises of teaching</i>

3
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,642
<i>life to a character,
reveals a confuse story.</i>

4
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,417
<i>A confuse and cold story,</i>

5
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,319
<i>with bad structure
and without conflict.</i>

6
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,521
<i>A fruitless effort.</i>

7
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:48,999
<i>A disappointment...</i>

8
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,181
<i>A disappointment...</i>

9
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,453
<i>A misfortune...</i>

10
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,882
<i>You need to really push
the stool!</i>

11
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,685
<i>Failure...</i>

12
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,953
<i>Go away, now!</i>

13
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,093
<i>Take your script!
Take this script!</i>

14
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,831
<i>Take this script
and go away!</i>

15
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,334
<i>Failure...</i>

16
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,134
<i>Danilo Porto, after years
of promises of teaching</i>

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,969
<i>life to a character,

18
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,842
<i>You need to really push
the stool!</i>

19
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,043
<i>Take this script!</i>

20
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,718
<i>Danilo!</i>

21
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,735
<i>Danilo!</i>

22
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:00,777
<i>Danilo!</i>

23
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,070
It's a friend of mine, Joana.
It's ok.

24
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,001
Ok, doctor Márcia.
Goodnight!

25
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,109
Goodnight!

26
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,206
How are you feeling?

27
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,441
Danilo?

28
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,882
I'm going to give you
some meds, ok?

29
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,681
Here it is.
Try to get some rest.

30
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,134
I'll come back
tomorrow, ok?

31
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,895
Tomorrow morning,
I'll be here.

32
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,519
Good morning!

33
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,565
What a beautiful day!

34
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,300
So, are you feeling better?

35
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,007
Did you put me in your clinic?

36
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,919
Well, here I can
take care of you.

37
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,411
I am exhausted!

38
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,886
Danilo, for how long
have we known each other?

39
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:52,958
Fifteen years, maybe?

40
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,718
I don't know if I'll manage
to get out of this.

41
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,460
I've seen you do it before.

42
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,523
Do you want talk?

43
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,732
So, let's go
grab some coffee.

44
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,171
Stop it, Danilo! Come on!
Come see the clinic.

45
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,806
Hi, Nelson!

46
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,950
Good morning!

47
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,017
Not everyone stays here.

48
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,911
Some of them attend
the therapeutic classes

49
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,717
and then at the end of the day,
they go home.

50
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,356
They don't receive just
psychiatric treatment, you know?

51
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,825
It's a place
for social reintegration.

52
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,259
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

53
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,231
Here, they learn
a bit about themselves.

54
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,961
They make wonderful things
over at the art classes.

55
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,836
Look at how beautiful they are!
They've made all of this!

56
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,302
Tonhâo!
Tonhâo!

57
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,337
Principal Márcia, look at
the bull I've made in art class!

58
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,305
Heloisa got jealous! She is not
all that good with her hands.

59
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,071
She is not good with anything!
I've tasted her food!

60
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,612
Her cooking is worse
than my mother's.

61
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,078
The crab took the little one on
his back, and entered the jungle.

62
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,116
I think they went
to do naughty things there...

63
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,945
One time, my mom made
scrambled eggs, without the egg.

64
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,291
I think I am going to give
my bull to Heloisa...

65
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,824
Did you like it?

66
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,085
I loved it!

67
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,992
Edmilson, this is Danilo,
a theater director.

68
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,365
Pleasure to meet you, Danilo.
My name is Edmilson.

69
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,060
One time, I went to the theater,
it was that play with that actress

70
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,534
from the soap opera.
It was boring!

71
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,569
I've slept through the whole thing
although I have trouble sleeping!

72
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,003
Sometimes, my mom gives me
chamomile tea to sleep,

73
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,868
but it doesn't usually work.

74
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:15,996
Chamomile tea
is good for you!

75
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,007
It's good! You should
drink a lot of chamomile tea.

76
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,408
It doesn't really work
all that well...

77
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,905
Tonhâo!
Tonhâo!

78
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,274
Look at the bull
that I made in art class.

79
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,406
Heloisa was jealous...

80
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,249
Eat something, Danilo.

81
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,544
- Shall we go, Márcia?
- In a second. I'm going!

82
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:30,951
Ademir!

83
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,457
Hold on! Are you going
to leave me all alone?

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,824
They are not going to jump you!
Relax, Danilo.

85
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,055
You are not going to jump
them either, right?!

86
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,436
It's over! It's over!
The cake is finished!

87
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,177
Good morning!
What is your name?

88
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,313
Did you forget, honey?!

89
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,324
It's Vânia.

90
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,828
<i>And the cake,
is there any left?</i>

91
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,796
<i>Isn't there any more cake?</i>

92
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,448
I bought it for you.

93
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,788
Did you like it?

94
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,702
I liked it.

95
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,474
Do you want to talk
about it?

96
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,105
I want to forget!

97
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,580
Forgetting does not make it
go away.

98
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,443
But if you don't want to talk
about it, it's fine.

99
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,622
I need to go.

100
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:15,992
Bye!

101
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,236
<i>I don't want to!</i>

102
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,403
<i>I don't want to go...</i>

103
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,947
<i>I don't want to go today!
I don't want to!</i>

104
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,276
<i>Please take me home
just for today!</i>

105
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,283
<i>I'll be quiet...
I don't want to...</i>

106
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,223
<i>I don't want to go today!</i>

107
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,524
<i>Come on, Estela.
I have another doll.</i>

108
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,330
<i>Hey! Yo!
Come back, nutty!</i>

109
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,418
Danilo, what is it
that bothers you?

110
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,666
Lack of justice.

111
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,976
Lack of justice
is what bothers me.

112
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,916
Yeah, right.

113
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,195
I've dedicated years of my life
on this project! Many, many years.

114
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,986
And I lost it all,
that I had put it in.

115
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,604
Come on! Motta Coqueiro
was responsible for the end

116
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,333
of death penalty in Brazil,
and nobody knows it!

117
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,380
I was crushed like a bug!

118
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,811
And what are you
going to do about it?

119
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,011
I don't know!

120
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,849
I don't know...

121
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,885
It's funny,
you know Danilo...

122
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,425
You think it is funny?!

123
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,754
I'm sorry! Bad choice of word!
It is interesting

124
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,532
that you feel that they did
you wrong, like your character,

125
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,102
and as Motta Coqueiro.

126
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,929
But I think that at this moment,
you have bigger issues to solve.

127
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,001
What other issues?

128
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,546
Danilo, your wife left you,
you are buried with debts,

129
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,443
your play
didn't turn out well...

130
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,426
Come on all,
last time.

131
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,089
<i>Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!</i>

132
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,699
<i>You can't even kick the stool!
You can't even kick the stool!</i>

133
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,268
<i>This way, it is impossible!
Impossible!</i>

134
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,963
<i>Kick it!</i>

135
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,731
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

136
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,066
<i>You! Get on top of this.</i>

137
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,105
<i>Let's roll.</i>

138
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,776
<i>You guys are playing around!
Playing around!</i>

139
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,546
<i>This looks like school theater!</i>

140
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,686
<i>When one of you find someone
that can kick a stool</i>

141
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,584
<i>we will do
the last scene of the play.</i>

142
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,621
<i>Because without it,
we won't have a hanged man!</i>

143
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,382
Would you like
to participate?

144
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,452
No! I'm Márcia's friend.

145
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,905
Did you know that this book
caused several suicides in Europe?

146
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,703
Thanks for letting me know.

147
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,281
You must be thinking:
"who is this crazy man,

148
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,145
that showed up out of no where
talking about death?"

149
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,210
That did cross my mind.

150
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,780
Nice to meet you.
My name is Danilo.

151
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,589
I'm Márcia's friend.

152
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,368
Aline.

153
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,199
I think he chose to suffer.

154
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,673
What?

155
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,344
Sorry... Werther.

156
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,346
He was never going
to give up on Charlotte.

157
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,182
"We have nothing, when we are
in debt with ourselves."

158
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,655
You know it by heart?!

159
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,259
I've tried to turn it
into a play.

160
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,526
Do you work with theater?

161
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,100
I try...

162
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,395
I direct,
and at times I write.

163
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,700
What are you doing here?
Researching?

164
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,878
No. I am...
I'm resting.

165
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,109
I'm trying to regroup
some thoughts in my head.

166
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,410
Love?

167
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,741
Work...

168
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,586
life...

169
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,755
Things get complicated
sometimes, you know?!

170
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,559
Is he your boyfriend?

171
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,898
They guy that was with you
yesterday?

172
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,242
I'm going to go.
Márcia is expecting me.

173
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,413
I'm sorry for the remark.

174
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,255
That play wouldn't turn out
too well either way.

175
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:05,103
It was cold...
It didn't reach out to people.

176
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,731
It's nice that you are starting
to see this. Real nice!

177
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,168
People are still torn
about Motta Coqueiro.

178
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,047
Some people fear it,
others are ashamed about it.

179
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,881
My mom was one
that was against it.

180
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,746
She used to say
that it brought bad luck.

181
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,213
So did my parents.

182
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,588
You are such a talented man...

183
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,951
Forget this, Danilo.

184
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,359
I can't!

185
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,426
Didn't bring anything
to read today?

186
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,205
Felipe came for his meds.

187
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,468
Your boyfriend?

188
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,842
Would you like to know?

189
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,450
And the theater?

190
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,142
Oh, the theater...

191
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,312
Well, I'm still digesting
my last big failure.

192
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,191
It was a play
about Motta Coqueiro's life.

193
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,661
It was you
that directed that play?!

194
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,863
Wasn't it he the guy
that was hung

195
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,398
because he ordered the murder
of a whole family?

196
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,598
It was something
like that.

197
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,408
I really didn't want to talk
about Motta Coqueiro right now.

198
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,811
Oh! I wanted so bad
to know more about this story!

199
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,174
Well, I really don't feel like
talking about it. I'm sorry.

200
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,148
Please, tell me!

201
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,885
Motta Coqueiro...

202
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,502
In real life, Motta Coqueiro
was married to a farmer

203
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,928
known as Úrsula das Virgens.

204
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,704
What a name?!

205
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,373
They were both
extremely greedy.

206
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,870
They used to take over
unproductive land,

207
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,345
and used to settle people
there to work on it.

208
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:09,519
The problem was that those lands
had owners. Powerful ones too!

209
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,020
Motta Coqueiro and Úrsula
made a lot of money,

210
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,093
and a lot of enemies.

211
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,298
There was a massacre
on their farms, wasn't there?

212
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,634
Yes, but two years
before the massacre,

213
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,508
Motta Coqueiro brought
someone to work

214
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,405
on one of those
unproductive lands

215
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,909
a planter called Benedito.

216
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,382
Benedito had
a beautiful daughter.

217
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,949
Although Motta Coqueiro
was dearly in love with his wife,

218
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,716
he was no ángel!

219
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,054
Go on...

220
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,825
Where was I?

221
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,294
So, Motta Coqueiro had an affair
with Benedito's daughter

222
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,196
and she got pregnant.

223
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,730
And so he ordered the murder
of the whole family?

224
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,741
Hold on! What is up with "he
order to kill the whole family"?!

225
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,371
Well, then Benedito started
to blackmail Motta Coqueiro

226
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,481
threatening to tell
everything to Úrsula,

227
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,847
if he didn't register
the farm on Benedito's name.

228
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,010
Did he tell her?

229
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,619
Well, there are some
history tellers that say

230
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,088
that Úrsula was the mentor
of the massacre.

231
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,323
Like it was the revenge
of a betrayed woman,

232
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,062
you know?

233
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,098
I know...

234
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,369
Around that time, it wasn't
all that common for rich men

235
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,167
to be condemned
with the death penalty.

236
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,103
But did he know it was her
that ordered the killing?

237
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,574
I think so.

238
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,546
And he didn't say anything?

239
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,543
I got the stuff.

240
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,955
Felipe, this is Danilo.

241
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,317
What's up, bro?
Chilling?

242
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,121
Chilling.

243
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,089
Let's bounce.

244
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,498
Wait.

245
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,760
I loved the story!

246
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,333
That's good.

247
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,432
Are you coming tomorrow?

248
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,769
It depends on Felipe.

249
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:14,974
Bye!

250
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,375
Let's go nutty!
Come on, nutty! Bounce!

251
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,241
Danilo?

252
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,251
Danilo Porto!
It's been a while man!

253
00:20:58,857 --> 00:20:59,983
- How are you, Iván?
- Good.

254
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,553
I read the critics
about your play...

255
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,423
A bit harsh, huh?!

256
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,527
Yeah, you know...

257
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,097
But tell me,
what are you doing up here?

258
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,030
Don't tell me
you came to work here?!

259
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,227
I was waiting for you at my office,
so that we could talk...

260
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,336
about the theater project?

261
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,670
I didn't know
that Iván worked here.

262
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:18,673
Danilo has everything

263
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,539
to do a great job
with us, Márcia.

264
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,614
It was exactly about that,
that we were going to talk about.

265
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,874
Well, I am going head back.

266
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,481
Aggressive, huh?!
Aggressive!

267
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,729
That's a good idea!

268
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:39,859
What is it?

269
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,091
You teaching theater here.
Great idea!

270
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,099
Don't start, Márcia.
Don't even start, ok?!

271
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,703
I've just said to ditch
Iván's questions.

272
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,667
The aggressive.

273
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,738
Come on, Danilo.
Let's talk about it.

274
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,872
Ok, dad.
Mom has already told me.

275
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,174
Of course...

276
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,578
I know... I know!

277
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,113
Dad, I know it!

278
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,013
Dad, I can't really talk
right now.

279
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,815
I'm working.

280
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,522
I did fix it, dad!

281
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,186
Can we talk later?
I will drop by.

282
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,761
Love, daddy!
Hugs!

283
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,195
I love you too.
Bye!

284
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,796
Father's way,
you know?!

285
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,399
No, I don't know.

286
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,578
Have you thought that it might
be a relation within the stories?

287
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,769
What stories?

288
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,940
Your father was also a victim
of injustice, right?

289
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,849
My father was not condemned.

290
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,751
He died as a scapegoat.

291
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,947
You all think everything has to
deal with father, and mothers.

292
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,689
I think that
pursuing this story

293
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,024
is a way of staying
confined in the past.

294
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,824
<i>The transplant of multiple parts,
like the kidneys,</i>

295
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:55,132
<i>it's facilitated by the fact that
the donors can be alive.</i>

296
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,543
Could you lend me a smoke?

297
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:05,947
No, no.

298
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:13,422
A theater class right here,
it's going to be awesome!

299
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,142
Hi!

300
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,108
I was waiting for you.

301
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,847
"Elective Affinities",
excellent!

302
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,786
You know what gets me
about Goethe?

303
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,484
How well he knows
the female soul.

304
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,156
I'm leaving.

305
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,494
I can't just be sitting here.
I need to get my life back.

306
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,971
But I think I will keep
on visiting the clinic.

307
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,467
Márcia has invited me
to open a theater class here.

308
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,244
How wonderful!

309
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,581
I thought about starting
with improvise games,

310
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,549
body language,
and things like that.

311
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,888
Why don't you work
with a script?

312
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,223
I don't think
they will be able to do it.

313
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,820
Go ahead.

314
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,363
May I?

315
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,341
Call me.

316
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,591
You've missed, Manoel!

317
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:56,625
Holy cow!

318
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,786
- Mr. Severino?
- Yes?

319
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,158
Do you have my key?

320
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,089
Oh! Your key!

321
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,735
Thank you.

322
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:49,310
On the way.

323
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,278
"Another one the way.

324
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,418
I am a poor man, with no land,
with 6 children,

325
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,816
and another one on the way.

326
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,352
My agreement with Mr. Motta
Coqueiro, it's a pact with God."

327
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,040
Did I wake you?

328
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,016
I'm sorry!

329
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,414
How mysterious, huh?!

330
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,952
- Are you curious?
- Very!

331
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,296
This is a very special place
for me. Very special.

332
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,467
I hide out here sometimes.

333
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,902
There is a bit about
my story in here.

334
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:57,247
The Mistake Comedy,
"Tartufo".

335
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,783
And Motta Coqueiro...

336
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,884
Motta Coqueiro?

337
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,892
I've rewritten the play.

338
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,932
I'd like for you to read.

339
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,340
Danilo, I don't know
anything about theater.

340
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,813
Ok. I will read it.
I promise!

341
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,518
Wow! How beautiful!

342
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,000
What do you think?

343
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:57,573
Sorry...
I was out of it.

344
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,110
Do I look like Úrsula?

345
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,507
I doubt that
she was this beautiful!

346
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,686
Felipe...

347
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,031
He is just a friend.

348
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,838
I'm not wearing panties...

349
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,714
Excuse me?

350
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,643
Come in.

351
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,977
Late!
You are late!

352
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,376
We've already started!

353
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,677
Grab a chair.
Open up a space for him.

354
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,586
It wasn't fair, obnoxiously
unfair, the contempt

355
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,488
of the dramatic talents
here at the clinic.

356
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,952
To open this theater class,
it's an act of justice!

357
00:29:59,097 --> 00:29:59,995
Your name is...

358
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,257
Godofredo.

359
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,588
What about you?

360
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,459
Your name is...

361
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,265
His name is Tonhâo.
He doesn't speak.

362
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,340
At least I haven't seen it. He
just keeps that stuffed owl face.

363
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,103
Always quiet.
He doesn't speak...

364
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,041
My name is Edmilson.
I root for "Flamengo", teacher!

365
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,408
"Flamengo"!
"Flamengo"!

366
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,141
<i>"Fluminense"!</i>

367
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,408
<i>Teacher, I root
for "Cruzeiro"!</i>

368
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,042
I root for "Fluminense", teacher!
My soccer team is "Fluminense".

369
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,016
I'm going to the bathroom!

370
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,178
There's no problem!

371
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,582
I'm going to the bathroom!

372
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,318
Tonhâo, Edmilson,
and you are?

373
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,425
Claudionor.

374
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,167
Claudionor.

375
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,239
Forgive me, Claudionor.

376
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,348
No, I am sorry teacher.
It's just that...

377
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,179
it makes me real
happy to be here.

378
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:03,855
André.

379
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:10,526
I used to attend the art classes,
but all that paint,

380
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,736
all that clay...

381
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:16,670
Theater is not like that!
Theater is an art more...

382
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,373
I like that.
I dig it!

383
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,743
My name is Nelson.
I love theater...

384
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,989
I don't know if I like it...
I do not know...

385
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:36,657
You?

386
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,123
The doctor told me that
this class could help me

387
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,530
improve my social skills,
on dealing with other people.

388
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:44,963
Your name?

389
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,203
Otávio.

390
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,806
You are Felipe.

391
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,568
Felipe.

392
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,811
My name is Danilo Porto,
I am a theater director.

393
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,244
I am Aline, and I've been
a patient here for 3 years.

394
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,119
This is the first time that I join
one of this therapeutic classes.

395
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,628
Loved it!

396
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,569
Come here.

397
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,273
No more games!

398
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,005
What game?

399
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,801
Why didn't you tell me
that you were one of the patients?

400
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,139
Because you didn't ask me.

401
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,345
We can't cross this line.

402
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,349
Danilo, it happened.
It happened...

403
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,979
I can't get involved
with a patient,

404
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,490
who is going to be
my student.

405
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:16,916
Why?

406
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,536
I'm trying
to overcome a crisis.

407
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,263
Are you afraid?

408
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,280
We can't do it!

409
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,179
Are you afraid that
it might rub off on you?

410
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,204
That's it.

411
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,572
See you
next class, teacher.

412
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,208
<i>Right!
One, two...</i>

413
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,483
Right! To the right,
Claudionor. Right!

414
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,877
Without fighting, Nelson.

415
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,055
Let's go.
One, two, right...

416
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:53,985
Claudionor!

417
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,023
He is left-handed.

418
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,592
Claudionor, come over here!

419
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,120
<i>Keep the rhythm!
Come back, Claudionor!</i>

420
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,753
Be careful not
to run into your friends!

421
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,430
Faster!
Faster! Come on!

422
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,427
Let's do the bus exercise.

423
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,367
We need a driver.
Who is going to be the driver?

424
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,475
Cashier?

425
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,543
Who is going to sit? Who is
going to be standing? Come on!

426
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,942
The bus is going to turn
on the left!

427
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,475
This drill goes like this,
I am going to call up someone,

428
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,811
and this person will come over
here on the chair.

429
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,579
Looking at the mirror, the person
will respond to my command.

430
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,725
Happy.

431
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,194
That's right, happy!

432
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,431
This is the first time
I've seen his smile.

433
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,999
Slowing down!
Take it easy.

434
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,396
Come on, Nelson!

435
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,602
What happen, Nelson?
What is the problem?

436
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,067
Let me handle it.
Let me handle it.

437
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,401
Keep on walking guys!
Keep on, don't stop!

438
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,272
- Do you want me to quit the drum?
- Quit the drum.

439
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,241
So, I will stop with the drum.

440
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,676
The bus stopped.
Who is getting off?

441
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,712
I'm getting off.

442
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,815
Aline got off...
The driver did too!

443
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,144
There is no driver!
There is no driver!

444
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,583
I'm the driver!

445
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,717
For the love of God!
Hurray!

446
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,954
Thoughtful.

447
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,431
Very good, Godofredo!

448
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,980
Can I go, Danilo?
Can I?

449
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,743
Not now, Edmilson.
Be patient.

450
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:28,807
Aline!

451
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,113
Anger.

452
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,718
Anger, Aline!

453
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,658
I can do it much better!
She doesn't know how to do it!

454
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,295
Let's move on.
Next one!

455
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,641
Tell me, Danilo.
How are your students?

456
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:58,737
Interesting...

457
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,341
To say the least, right?!

458
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:07,552
The funny thing is that
some of them look normal.

459
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,761
They are being treated:
therapy, medication.

460
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,331
It all helps a lot.

461
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:20,293
Felipe and Aline are two
that look normal.

462
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,660
They just look normal!

463
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,206
Aline for example,
she is beautiful,

464
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,375
but on the inside
things are much different.

465
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,378
Is that right?

466
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,782
She acts up and doesn't feel
guilt for what she does

467
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,514
Not even the slightest guilty.
It's absurd!

468
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,090
Really.

469
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,718
On her last crisis, she caught her
ex-boyfriend with another girl

470
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,555
and she just cut the girl
with a knife.

471
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,368
She was committed
for sometime and then left

472
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,063
on the condition of continuing
with her treatment, and she is.

473
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,441
You could never tell, huh?!

474
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:07,375
Danilo, your students might
seem very interesting.

475
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,183
They might even
seem normal.

476
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,949
But you cannot forget
that they are patients

477
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,852
with very delicate issues.

478
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,295
To hell with adaptation, rules,
guidelines... doctor Márcia...

479
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,727
I'm done with these meds!

480
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,701
This is outrageous!
I can't live without my meds!

481
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,080
I rewrote the play
about Motta Coqueiro.

482
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,256
I thought about
rehearsing it with them.

483
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,692
With the patients?

484
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,396
I think that
it might be good.

485
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,730
Right.

486
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,505
It could even result in some
good feedback for the clinic.

487
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,811
Danilo, it's a heavy plot...
people die!

488
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,514
I could leave
the massacre out.

489
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,752
And who are you going to choose
for the hung man?

490
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,251
Oh, I haven't thought
about that yet.

491
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,448
Is that so?!

492
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,189
I could get someone
from the outside.

493
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,753
No way!

494
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,828
Danilo, it's a violent story.
It could affect them.

495
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,059
Don't you get that?

496
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,895
I could be Motta Coqueiro.

497
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,574
A sketch, a lab, it's one thing,
but a whole script?!

498
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,716
You know, watching you
from up close, I can't remember

499
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,150
why we broke up.

500
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,380
Because you chose
another girl with bikinis.

501
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:04,025
I didn't choose nobody
with bikinis over you.

502
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,763
What a dog!
You are such a dog!

503
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,165
You will do just about anything
to convince me of it.

504
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,701
It will turn out well.
I am sure of it

505
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,512
Ok! So, you think that remaking
the play with the patients

506
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,374
is going to solve
your problem?

507
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,617
I do think so!

508
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,387
Fine! But I am going
to watch you closely, ok?!

509
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,064
And please try to find a way
that it will not set them off.

510
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:35,932
I will!

511
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,093
No way!

512
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,702
- Just a kiss!
- You fool!

513
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,504
One kiss...

514
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,307
"To stand the darts and throws..."

515
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,205
Pause.

516
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,675
"of the ever adverse load..."

517
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,301
That's right!

518
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,849
"or to be prepared against an
ocean of misfortunes and end it"

519
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,814
That's right!

520
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,043
"while trying to resist.

521
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,118
Period.

522
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,187
"To die, to sleep

523
00:40:59,023 --> 00:40:59,955
nothing more...

524
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,556
maybe to dream."

525
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,454
Good job, Edmilson!

526
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,364
Good job, man!
Excellent job, man!

527
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,631
Thank you, Nelson!
Thank you!

528
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,271
Great rehearsal guys!
Really good!

529
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,933
I am going to
memorize everything!

530
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,543
Do it!
Memorize it all, Vânia!

531
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,504
Did you see, Márcia?

532
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,510
They knew it all!
They are ruling it!

533
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,773
I did. But you cannot forget
that they are on meds, Danilo,

534
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,316
they are molded.

535
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,147
I won't forget
that they are molded

536
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,118
to society's rules.
Don't worry!

537
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,824
That's not what I've said.
The meds stabilizes their mood.

538
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,483
And it doesn't slow
them down?!

539
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,486
It's the side effects.

540
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,962
But they can't be
without their meds.

541
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,725
Do you get that?!
They cannot!

542
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,232
Ok, doctor Márcia.

543
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,160
Bye, Danilo.

544
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,531
Bye, Vânia!

545
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,799
Bye, Danilo.

546
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:52,772
Did you like it?

547
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,212
Can we talk?

548
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,007
No, not really.

549
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,140
Aline, I'm a bit tired.

550
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,015
I need to take a shower,
and relax a bit.

551
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,449
Are you avoiding me?

552
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,621
No! Of course not!
I just have a headache.

553
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:11,792
Bye!

554
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,475
Danilo? Hold up!
Hold up!

555
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:29,135
Danilo, how are you liking to
give classes to nut jobs, nutty?

556
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,574
I bet that
it is a real disorder.

557
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,516
I wouldn't stay in a room
with them for nothing!

558
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:37,947
I'm going to hit
the restroom, guys!

559
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,655
It's not how we expect it to be.
It's interesting, they do learn.

560
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,949
Really?

561
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,055
How did you end up
there, man?

562
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,325
I don't know if
you remember Márcia,

563
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,864
a friend of mine.
Doctor Márcia.

564
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,058
Short girl with glasses?

565
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,999
No! I don't know if you
recall it, she is a...

566
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,938
Are you feeling better?

567
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,877
Yes, I am feeling better.

568
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,141
Danilo, introduce her
to us.

569
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,684
This is Aline, she is one
of my students at the clinic.

570
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,489
Hello, Aline. Pleasure
to meet you, Fernando.

571
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:14,585
The pleasure is mine.

572
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,984
- Marcos.
- Nice to meet you.

573
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,022
- Glaucia.
- How are you?

574
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,098
- Marta.
- Sit down, have a drink with us.

575
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,930
No, thank you.
Medical orders... I can't mix up.

576
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,728
But it was a pleasure
to meet all of you.

577
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,130
Get well.

578
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,836
What a cute nutty, huh?!

579
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,405
What are you going to have?

580
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:42,083
Nothing. I've seen
what I came here for. Let's go.

581
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,920
Oh, Danilo.
The nutty is leaving.

582
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,491
It might be a crisis.

583
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,158
Well, I brought you
some scripts.

584
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:56,196
I want you to read
and memorize the character

585
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,927
that each one of you
is going to play on the plot.

586
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,057
Come on, guys!

587
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,568
Come on! Let's get
this room ready, ok?!

588
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,002
Giris, bring the chairs
down here.

589
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,174
Vânia.

590
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,038
Tonhâo and Godofredo,
go get the structure.

591
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,076
Claudionor.

592
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,908
The curtains -
Edmilson and Otávio.

593
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,242
Give this to Nelson, please.

594
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,145
Did you get it?

595
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,376
Aline...

596
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:15,540
Come on!
Get up!

597
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,551
André...

598
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:17,585
Be careful!

599
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,813
And Edmilson.

600
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:19,980
Take this off, now!

601
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,091
- No, I won't take it off!
- Take it off!

602
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,159
Nelson, yours is here Nelson.
This is Otávio's.

603
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,284
But mine
doesn't have medals!

604
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,420
Don't worry about that!
Look at this one, it's gorgeous!

605
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,222
Fool!

606
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,331
Stop! Both of you, stop!

607
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,899
His is much nicer than mine!

608
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,299
Mine doesn't have medals!

609
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,869
Edmilson, Edmilson!
Come over here! Yours is here!

610
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:33,867
I wouldn't let it go like that!

611
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,164
<i>- Here is yours, Edmilson.
- Where is mine?</i>

612
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,469
Edmilson, Fidélis, Carolina,

613
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,970
Claudionor.

614
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,876
Try to memorize as much
as you can, ok?

615
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,881
For next class, ok?

616
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,744
"I'm just taking you
as a settler, Benedito

617
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,988
because of this
darn lack of slaves."

618
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,552
"I'm a poor man with no land,
with 6 children to raise

619
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,420
and another one
on the way."

620
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,120
Comma! Comma!
You need to breathe, Edmilson!

621
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,389
I forgot the comma, Danilo!
Without it you can't understand!?

622
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,259
No, I can't understand!

623
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,832
Could I try it again?
Please!

624
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,366
Ok. I am going to give
you the cue, ok?

625
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,200
"I'm just taking you
as a settler, Benedito

626
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,569
because of this
darn lack of slaves."

627
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,140
"I am a poor man,

628
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,039
Comma!

629
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,042
with no land...

630
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:15,941
Comma!

631
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,070
and 6 children to raise...

632
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,910
Serious face,
with evil looking eyes! Quick!

633
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,083
and another one on the way."

634
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:20,706
Period!

635
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,216
"My agreement with you,
Mr. Motta Coqueiro,

636
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:22,910
Yes!

637
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,078
it's a pact with God."

638
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,120
That's it!

639
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,814
He had a bad guy
expressión!

640
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:27,889
Guys! Guys!

641
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,323
Please, the play is not over!
Please!

642
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,755
"If in two years you do not meet
with the improvements

643
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:37,095
that we agreed on, I will
be forced to kick you out...

644
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,799
Vânia?!

645
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:39,732
Vânia!

646
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,132
Vânia? Vânia!

647
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,772
This is not the time
for make up!

648
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,966
Come on! You should have already
been behind Edmilson.

649
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,273
Please, let's all pay attention
to the cues!

650
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,411
I'm sorry.

651
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,279
"lf... the improvements that we
agreed on, I will be forced

652
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,281
to kick you out
of Bananal's farm."

653
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,042
Who is there behind you?

654
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,050
It's Vânia.

655
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:56,982
It's Francisca.

656
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,110
It's Vânia!

657
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,482
Edmilson, stay with me.
Focus, please!

658
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,091
"It's Francisca. Francisca
is my oldest daughter.

659
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,784
She is as shy
as a Christmas' turkey!

660
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,223
Chica, come on over to the front
where our boss can see you."

661
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,257
"But she is an adorable girl!"

662
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,030
Thank you, Mr. Coqueiro.

663
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,736
"No formalities!
Call me Motta."

664
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,367
"Ok, Motta."

665
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:30,852
Wasn't it a French kiss?
It was written!

666
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,458
No, Vânia. It's not
a French kiss! Good job!

667
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,192
He kissed her!
He kissed her!

668
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,728
Now, you can applaud!
Great job all!

669
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:46,231
It was a great rehearsal, Edmilson!
Great job! Don't forget to pause!

670
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,428
Breathe!

671
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,630
Guys, please pay attention!

672
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,734
Tomorrow, we'll do the scene with
Juliâo, Úrsula and Motta, ok?

673
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,839
Let's be prepared!
You are doing a great job!

674
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,245
Excellent!
Good job!

675
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,389
I'm glad you liked it!
I'm going to go change.

676
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:18,629
"I've came to offer my sincere
wishes of happiness for both.

677
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,504
May you, Motta, have
an everlasting relationship.

678
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,243
"My wish is for you, my cousin,
to have a great trip

679
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,742
back to your farm."

680
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,110
"Motta, that is not how
you should treat our visits."

681
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,237
"Cousin,

682
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:38,146
I've just came to offer you
my friendship, and one advice."

683
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,621
"So, do it!"

684
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:44,158
"Dear cousins, you didn't
only unit your farms,

685
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,190
as you have also occupied
other areas."

686
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,727
"And what exactly do you
have to deal with that?"

687
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:57,070
"Some of those areas already
had owners. Important people."

688
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:00,868
"I just settle people
in abandoned areas."

689
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,640
"Cousin Motta,
here is my advice"

690
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,044
Stand up, on "Primo Motta",
stand up, then say it!"

691
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,341
"Here is..."

692
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,019
"Cousin Motta,
here is my advice"

693
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,252
Walk...

694
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,213
Turn to the other side,
to the public.

695
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:19,893
Watch carefully..."

696
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,225
"Watch your steps carefully

697
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,526
Because if some day
you end up tripping and falling,

698
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,393
you won't find a single soul
to help you get up."

699
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,465
"Are you threatening
my husband?"

700
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:34,710
"I'm not threatening anyone!"

701
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,804
"Juliâo, get out
of my house!"

702
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:42,315
André, no! André, through
the aisle. There you go!

703
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,512
We wrap it up here,
looking at each other.

704
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,214
Very good!

705
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,085
Excellent, André!

706
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,631
Excellent job, Juliâo!
Very good!

707
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:58,695
Aline, I need
to talk to you.

708
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,639
Danilo, do I have to wear
a wig? The judge, does he?

709
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,968
We haven't thought
about that yet, Godofredo.

710
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:07,935
Aline, I wanted to...

711
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:09,442
I'm sorry.

712
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,603
No worries! Come in.

713
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,545
I wanted to talk to you.

714
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,448
I brought you a text...

715
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:20,614
About us?

716
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,720
You don't give up, do you?

717
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,988
Never! I always
go until the end.

718
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:33,896
I would like for you to read
this at the end of the show.

719
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:42,004
"After the hanging of Manoel
da Motta Coqueiro..."

720
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,543
It's an important text.

721
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:44,836
Very.

722
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,013
What about our end?

723
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,049
Our end...

724
00:49:55,826 --> 00:50:01,389
Let's take it easy.
Don't tease me.

725
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,474
What's going on, Danilo?

726
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,752
Don't you know it?
Passión!

727
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,814
Put your clothes on,
and leave.

728
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:26,920
No! I am going to stay.

729
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,082
Leave, right now!

730
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,590
Bye!

731
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,302
I am sorry...

732
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:50,602
There are no excuses.

733
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:53,875
It wasn't my fault!

734
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:58,884
You allowed it, Danilo. You are
not a child. You've allowed it!

735
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,784
I didn't know she was a patient,
in the beginning!

736
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,688
This is very serious.
What you've done is very serious!

737
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,319
I've should had notice on
that day by the waterfall...

738
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,429
Those questions at
the waterfall... At the waterfall!

739
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,522
No! You might not believe it, but
I didn't want

740
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,531
any of this
to have happened!

741
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,330
It's unethical!
It's unethical!

742
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,836
She played me!

743
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,333
You've created
a big problem for her...

744
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,101
You've created a big problem
for the other patients, and me!

745
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,868
I am sorry, but you cannot
continue teaching here.

746
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,403
What about the play?

747
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,377
They've memorized the script...
we have a rehearsal tomorrow!

748
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,546
What do you want?
Do you want to ruin everything?

749
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:30,677
Me?

750
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,816
You've ruined everything!

751
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,849
Tomorrow, I want you to come up
with a great excuse

752
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,585
to say goodbye to them.

753
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:39,922
You are making a mistake!

754
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,361
Shut up!

755
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:47,597
I work very hard
to make lifes of people like her

756
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,171
a bit better.

757
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,506
And that, you are not
going to ruin! You won't!

758
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,974
I'm going to leave
town for a while.

759
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:11,190
It's a complicated
family issue.

760
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,194
So, I hope you
can understand.

761
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:26,834
Danilo, please!
You can't leave us!

762
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,545
I'm not going
to leave you, Claudionor...

763
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:35,280
Doctor Márcia is going to get
someone else to work here.

764
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:39,288
Bad... bad...

765
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,449
It's ok! Sit down for a second,
and we will talk.

766
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,259
I must go.

767
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,973
I've already contacted
another teacher.

768
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,016
We are going to meet
this weekend,

769
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:13,284
and on Monday he's going to come
by to meet you guys, ok?

770
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,213
I wish you all
a great weekend.

771
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:24,893
Felipe, close the door.

772
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:37,139
Márcia, can we talk?

773
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,374
No, let's forget it.
Go away!

774
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,482
Everything is a lie!

775
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:48,390
Danilo doesn't have
any issue!

776
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,723
Doctor Márcia came up
with this whole story.

777
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,518
I heard them talking
yesterday.

778
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,596
She said that she didn't
like our rehearsals,

779
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:59,727
that nobody here, nobody,
was capable of acting...

780
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,665
That's not true!
We did it!

781
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,804
We all memorized
our characters!

782
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,642
So, she pretended?

783
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,004
She was pretending
to like it?

784
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,171
She lied.

785
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:19,112
That's not fair! It's obnoxiously
unfair for her to do that

786
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,280
with us, and for him
to go along.

787
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,493
Teacher, Danilo.
Teacher, Danilo!

788
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,627
Open the door, teacher!
Open up! Open up!

789
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,931
Hello, teacher Danilo!
How are you?

790
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,063
We came over to invite you
to come to your farewell party

791
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,367
that we are having
tomorrow in the afternoon.

792
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,771
Everybody from the theater class
is organizing it.

793
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,639
We are going to have sodas,
juice, and...

794
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,043
Hold on, Edmilson!

795
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,673
We would really
like for you to come.

796
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,339
We really, really do
want you to come, ok?

797
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,883
A party?

798
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:53,181
I'm not really up for parties,
Edmilson.

799
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,751
Oh, teacher! But we did
everything with so much love!

800
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,814
Are you just going to leave us
out like that, teacher?

801
00:54:56,926 --> 00:55:00,623
Drop by, Danilo.
Look, here is the address.

802
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:10,836
Ok.

803
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,165
Alright! Alrighty then!
Edmilson, let's roll!

804
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,838
Bye, teacher! My stepfather is
giving me a new pair of sandals

805
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,707
for the party...

806
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,541
Let's go, Edmilson!

807
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,705
Hold on!
Why the hurry?!

808
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,108
Listen, we are going to wait
for you, Danilo!

809
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,114
Please don't bail on us!

810
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,152
<i>Now, you are all in a hurry,
but to come, you were slugguishing</i>

811
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,319
The house is huge!
And it is full of wood!

812
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,187
No, thank you very much.
I don't want any.

813
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,187
Is there any
alcohol, grandma?

814
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,658
No! Only juice.

815
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,163
This house is all of wood,
if it gets termites in here...

816
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,365
Look who is here!

817
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,132
It's so nice of you to show up,
Danilo. I'm so glad!

818
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,344
Thank you, Claudionor.

819
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,705
Look, my aunt gave me!
It's furry!

820
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:50,871
- It's nice, Nelson.
- Thank you!

821
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,141
Beautiful! Beautiful!

822
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:52,977
It's a pleasure!

823
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,142
Teacher Danilo,
look at my new sandals.

824
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,718
It was a gift
from my stepfather.

825
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,481
I missed you!
So did she!

826
00:55:58,888 --> 00:55:59,820
I missed you too!

827
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:00,955
Give me a kiss.

828
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,786
Let me say hi
to everybody, ok Tonhâo?

829
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:05,418
André.

830
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,760
Did you like
my outfit, Danilo?

831
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,489
Teacher, there is a chair
for you over here

832
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,664
<i>I came by bus with Nelson.</i>

833
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,584
Hi!

834
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,081
Hi...

835
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,726
Grandma! Grandma! Come here!
This is Danilo.

836
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,327
He was my theater teacher.

837
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,827
Oh, ok. Are you
also a patient?

838
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,092
No, grandma! He is my
theater teacher.

839
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,100
Oh... what would you
like to drink?

840
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,433
Nothing, thank you.

841
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,441
Ok, then.

842
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,976
- Is it your house?
- Yes.

843
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,146
Where are your parents?

844
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:00,483
Traveling.

845
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,208
I was waiting on you!
I want to show you something!

846
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:09,856
Come in, Danilo.

847
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:14,861
This party is all on you,
isn't it?

848
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,132
It's a party for you.

849
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:19,767
Hey, hold on!

850
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,402
A gift... for you.

851
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,208
It's been here for years.

852
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:43,853
Wow! This is so rare!

853
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,961
Watch out for termites,
this house is made out of wood.

854
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,965
- What about the bread?
- I don't like bread!

855
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,203
Watch it!

856
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,675
Relax, grandma!

857
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,076
We are just talking.

858
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,511
Where is the bar key,
grandma?

859
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,022
I don't know.

860
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,724
I loved it!
Can we go back?

861
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:36,601
Give me the key!

862
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,481
Hold on! Calm down, Tonhâo!
Calm down!

863
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:52,457
Thanks, Otávio!
Guys, let's drink up!

864
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,328
Give me the liqueur!
Give me the liqueur!

865
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,830
I can't! I'm breastfeeding.

866
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,992
Just a sip won't do you harm.

867
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:00,729
No! I want real liqueur!

868
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:02,630
Give it to me, Tonhâo!

869
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,432
Oh, my God! My son-in-law
is going to kill me!

870
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,395
All hell is going
to break loose!

871
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,231
Didn't I tell you that
there were termites in here?!

872
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,705
Mrs. Yolanda,
where is the restroom?

873
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,336
I'm feeling some
pleasure on my genitalia.

874
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,578
Oh, my God!
It's there.

875
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,863
- Can you do it?
- Yes, I can.

876
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,164
- I want to see it.
- Ok!

877
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,242
Are you scared?

878
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,039
I am not afraid of anything.
I just don't feel like it.

879
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:18,873
Why?

880
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,074
Because I don't want it.
Give me the key!

881
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,811
Because I'm crazy

882
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,216
Insane...

883
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:25,550
Nuts...

884
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:26,620
I want to go downstairs.

885
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,522
One moment!
Where is the key?

886
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:32,657
One moment!

887
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,993
Hot dog and some juice,
from Mrs. Yolanda.

888
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,295
I don't want it!
Excuse me.

889
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,029
But I brought it for you!

890
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:50,241
Thank you.

891
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:13,936
Aline?

892
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,179
What the hell is this?!

893
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,453
<i>Motta Coqueiro!</i>

894
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:46,526
<i>Motta Coqueiro!</i>

895
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:51,907
<i>Motta Coqueiro!</i>

896
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,676
Motta Coqueiro! Come out of there,
so that we can talk!

897
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:03,110
It's Carolina.

898
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,654
Benedito wants to talk
to you, Sir.

899
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,453
Where are we, Estela?

900
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,753
Sir, it's better that you know
that he has drunken a few...

901
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:23,969
Motta Coqueiro!

902
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,138
I've came to tell you that
I'm not leaving Bananal farm.

903
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,012
What's going on, Edmilson?

904
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,277
Don't you try to fool me with
the talk of how it has been

905
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,575
two years and you
haven't seen any changes.

906
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,741
If I didn't raise it for me,
what would my children eat?

907
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,816
Is everybody here?

908
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:41,082
I'm tired of hearing that to you
there are no advantages

909
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,384
of keeping me as a settler.

910
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,458
Well, do know that all
the advantage that you could have

911
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,618
taken, you have done it.

912
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,559
Chica! Chica!
Come over here, Chica!

913
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,491
Come here, Chica!

914
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,899
For the services executed
by my daughter to you,

915
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,701
I deserve to have the land
that I am occupying

916
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,035
What have you done to her?

917
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,336
Are you threatening me,
Motta Coqueiro?

918
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,508
First, you knock up my daughter,
and now you threaten my life?

919
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:12,211
That's enough, Edmilson.
Enough!

920
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,514
You are starting
to cross the limits.

921
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,319
I'm going to punch you so bad,
that I will cave your nose!

922
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:17,449
You are crossing
the line, Edmilson!

923
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,720
You are starting to hurt me.
Stop it!

924
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:22,896
With no nose, you are going
to look like a dried coconut.

925
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,465
I've already said
that I'm not Motta Coqueiro!

926
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,829
I've already said
that I'm not Motta Coqueiro!

927
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,060
Could someone
please help me?!

928
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,338
I'm going to kill you!

929
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,965
You are hurting me!
That's about enough, Edmilson!

930
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:38,241
Felipe!
Felipe! Felipe!

931
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,548
I am going to kill you,
Motta Coqueiro!

932
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,480
Fidélis!

933
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,312
Let him go!
Let him go!

934
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,189
Are you out of your mind?
Are you crazy?

935
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,251
You should speak
with Mrs. Úrsula.

936
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,724
Mrs. Úrsula is a mother,
Mrs. Úrsula is a woman.

937
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:52,623
She is going to understand
the situation of my dear Chica.

938
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:53,922
Shut up!

939
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,258
What do I do with him?

940
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,634
Get them away from me!

941
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,738
But don't hurt them.
Neither him, nor Vânia.

942
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,007
I heard it all, Motta.

943
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:11,538
What the hell is this?

944
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,882
You were the one that brought
everyone over here, weren't you?

945
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,510
Manoel da Motta Coqueiro
don't change de subject!

946
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:18,918
Did you see
what he did to me?

947
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,546
Is the girl carrying
your child or not?

948
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,623
Did you see
what he did to me?

949
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,487
Excuse me, Mr. Coqueiro,
Mrs. Úrsula,

950
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,117
lunch is being served.

951
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,466
If I were you, I would start
looking for a new lover.

952
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,546
Why did you
bring me over here?

953
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,790
There is no need to serve me,
I don't want it!

954
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,291
Are you aware of what
you are doing to them?

955
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,395
No, you aren't!

956
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,660
What did you put in my drink?

957
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,972
Aline... Aline.

958
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,476
Could you stop
messing around?

959
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:21,107
Motta, your issues with Benedito
are making you so nervous.

960
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,410
I am not nervous!
Can you stop?

961
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:23,746
Let's end this.
Enough! It's over!

962
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,922
It's over! Over! Over!
Enough with this game, ok Estela?

963
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:30,621
Quit it!

964
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,926
Your food is getting cold.

965
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,528
Carlos!

966
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,759
Bring your lord's food
to him.

967
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:41,667
I don't want it!

968
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:43,828
I really don't want it, Tonhâo!
I do not want it.

969
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:53,571
Alright then,
I will leave!

970
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,030
Aline!

971
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,334
Aline!

972
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,165
Tonhâo!
Estela!

973
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:01,981
<i>Mrs. Úrsula!</i>

974
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,322
<i>Mrs. Úrsula!</i>

975
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,334
<i>Mrs. Úrsula!</i>

976
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,800
- What took you so long?
- It took a while to gather them.

977
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,037
Mrs. Úrsula!

978
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,233
Mrs. Úrsula, you know
that I hear a lot, don't you?

979
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:02,068
And I've heard...

980
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,076
What have you heard,
Domingos?

981
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,511
I've heard that...
Nevermind, Mrs. Úrsula.

982
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,009
People are talking about a quarrel
among the lord and Benedito.

983
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,476
Let's bounce!
Come on, hurry!

984
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,490
Everybody?

985
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,294
Everybody.

986
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,267
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's bounce! Let's go!

987
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,891
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

988
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,527
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

989
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,176
Benedito, it's Fidélis.

990
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,313
Coqueiro wants to set
a deal with you.

991
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,413
I came to get you,
so that you could talk to him.

992
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,817
Businesses should be handled
at sunlight!

993
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,390
He wants to talk
to you today!

994
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,254
Don't open it!
Don't open it!

995
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,328
He is leaving to Rio de Janeiro,
early tomorrow morning.

996
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,190
Open the door!

997
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,558
Edmilson! Edmilson!

998
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,895
Let's get this over with!

999
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:07,991
Let's do it!

1000
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:23,780
Get her!

1001
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,046
The bitch is running away!
Get her!

1002
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:30,554
Get that bitch!
Get her! Get her!

1003
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:08,162
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

1004
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:40,853
Where is everybody?

1005
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,265
Estela!
Estela!

1006
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,261
Gather everyone, Aline!

1007
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,436
Let's end this.
Let's be serious! It's serious!

1008
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,300
They've killed them both!

1009
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,743
Are you listening to me?
They've killed Edmilson and Vânia.

1010
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:09,789
Say something!

1011
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,823
They killed Edmilson and Vânia.
Aren't you hearing?

1012
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,629
If you are speaking about
Benedito and Francisca,

1013
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,757
I did what it had
to be done.

1014
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,569
Or are you going to tell me that
you would like to have a baby

1015
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,935
by that slut and lose our lands
to that drunk man?

1016
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:34,447
She is not a slut!
She is Vânia! Vâ-nia!

1017
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:40,018
He is not Benedito, he's Edmilson.
They've died, beaten to death!

1018
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,816
Don't you get it?

1019
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,453
They had it coming.

1020
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,361
You are losing your mind!
Where is everybody?

1021
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:57,397
André! Otávio! Heloisa!

1022
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,007
Everyone.
It's over!

1023
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,006
Aline, stop!

1024
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,371
Who is Aline?

1025
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,208
Who is Aline?
Who is Aline?

1026
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,311
Who is Aline?

1027
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,245
Who is she?

1028
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:14,217
Why don't you tell me?!
Who is Aline?

1029
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,027
I was so afraid...

1030
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,226
I was so afraid
of losing you...

1031
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:32,033
so, so afraid!

1032
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,171
Are you taking your meds?

1033
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:39,673
I don't need medication.
I am as strong as a horse!

1034
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,673
I don't need drugs!

1035
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:42,443
So, let's bounce.

1036
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,213
So, let's go!
It's over! Come on!

1037
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:45,944
Come on, gather everyone!
Come on!

1038
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:46,747
Where will we go?

1039
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,050
Call Otávio, Estela...
call everyone up! Let's bounce!

1040
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,815
It's safe here.

1041
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,392
It is safe here,
at our home, on our farm.

1042
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:55,986
Do you know what is going
to happen with me after massacre?

1043
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,155
No... how would I know?

1044
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:59,392
I don't have
a crystal ball, Motta.

1045
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,297
They're going to want to catch me!
I cannot stay here!

1046
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:02,734
Motta, stay here! Motta!

1047
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,505
Motta come back!
Come back!

1048
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,280
Motta Coqueiro!

1049
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:21,614
Motta Coqueiro!

1050
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:23,951
Motta Coqueiro!

1051
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:26,960
Motta Coqueiro!

1052
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,221
Motta Coqueiro!

1053
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,690
Motta Coqueiro!

1054
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,379
I caught you,
Motta Coqueiro.

1055
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,647
My name is Danilo, man!
I am Danilo!

1056
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:56,883
It's useless to try
to use a fake name.

1057
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,118
The whole town
wants your neck!

1058
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:00,622
Tell them to get off
from me, Otávio!

1059
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:03,663
Son of a bitch! Come here!
You are going to face trial.

1060
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:04,762
What trial?

1061
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,333
You are going to face trial,
Motta Coqueiro.

1062
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,733
And you know exactly
what happens to killers.

1063
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,463
Nelson! Nelson!

1064
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:11,931
Let's bounce!

1065
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,735
Mr. Luiz Tinoco,
as you declares the defendant?

1066
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:19,870
Innocent.

1067
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,217
The prosecutor Paulino
has the stand.

1068
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,087
We are gathered here
to judge a hideous crime

1069
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,750
The massacre of a family!

1070
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:34,392
Your Honor, juries,
please look

1071
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,055
at the victim's clothes.

1072
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:41,865
Blood! A lot of blood!

1073
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,072
Slave, clean this up!

1074
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,500
The police report revealed,
as the killers

1075
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:52,905
two slaves, and two employees
of Manoel da Motta Coqueiro.

1076
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:56,312
And as the mentor of the crime,
he himself, Mr. Coqueiro.

1077
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,012
I call the first witness
to the stand,

1078
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,818
the slave Balbina.

1079
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,549
Object!
That's unconstitutional.

1080
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,055
Well done, Mr. Tinoco.

1081
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,423
The defender has pointed out
that according to the law,

1082
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,724
slaves cannot testify
against their owners.

1083
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:16,161
Your Honor, the defendant's
turned her over to his stepson.

1084
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,566
She doesn't live
on his farm anymore.

1085
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,336
Denied! Go on.

1086
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,539
On the 12th,
early morning,

1087
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,371
I heard Coqueiro
calling up four men.

1088
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:28,583
That's a lie!

1089
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:30,183
He wanted to know
if they had done the job.

1090
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,547
That's a lie! How would she
see anything,

1091
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,450
if she didn't live on
Motta Coqueiro's farm,

1092
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,715
but on Carrapato's?

1093
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,380
I was visiting my niece,

1094
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:39,517
Did you hear Mr. Coqueiro say
why he ordered the killing?

1095
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:43,028
No, sir. But everybody knew that
Benedito thought he had the right

1096
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:45,361
to keep the Bananal's farm,
because Mr. Coqueiro...

1097
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,025
because he had knocked up
his oldest daughter.

1098
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,596
No further questions,
your Honor.

1099
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,706
Would the defender like
to question the witness?

1100
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:00,882
Carolina, do you confirm what your
aunt has said about

1101
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,415
what she had heard the defendant
asking the 4 men about the job?

1102
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,385
Everything happened
like she said.

1103
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:12,217
No further questions, and I call
the slave Fernandes to the stand.

1104
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:16,289
Do you belong to Juliâo
Baptista Coqueiro,

1105
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,131
Motta Coqueiro's cousin.

1106
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:23,564
My lord prefers to be called by
his new legal name,

1107
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,466
which is...

1108
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:32,803
Juliâo Baptista
Pereira de Almeida.

1109
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:37,313
What do you know about
the massacre of Benedito's family?

1110
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,348
I heard that...

1111
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,479
Testimony of "I've heard"
is not a proof!

1112
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,292
Juliâo wanted retaliate
Motta Coqueiro!

1113
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,956
He wants to
manipulate this court!

1114
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,788
Silence, defendant!

1115
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,066
Do you have ways of proving
what you have just said?

1116
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,434
The only proof I can give you
is my word.

1117
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:01,303
The word of Juliâo Baptista
Pereira's slave

1118
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,410
is good enough
for this court.

1119
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,947
The defender may call
his witnesses.

1120
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,014
No witnesses?

1121
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:18,021
But to this court it does not
seem fair to allow the jury

1122
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,727
to decide without hearing
the defendant's plea.

1123
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:25,597
After the recess, we will hear
what Manoel da Motta Coqueiro

1124
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,393
has to say.

1125
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:53,090
<i>Aline!</i>

1126
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,661
<i>I loved the story!</i>

1127
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:57,622
<i>They cannot be without
medication, do you get that?</i>

1128
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,194
<i>Am I crazy? Nuts?</i>

1129
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,270
<i>To insist on this story is
to be tied to the past.</i>

1130
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,634
<i>Do I look like Úrsula?</i>

1131
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,505
<i>But did he know that she was the
mentor, and didn't say anything?</i>

1132
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:11,669
<i>Couldn't it be a connection
within the stories?</i>

1133
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,904
<i>I loved the story!</i>

1134
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:17,451
<i>Danilo, your students might
seem interesting,</i>

1135
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:21,215
<i>they can even look normal,
but you can't forget</i>

1136
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,518
<i>that they're patients
with very delicate issues.</i>

1137
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:24,852
<i>You are scared.</i>

1138
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:27,860
<i>To insist on this story is
to be tied to the past.</i>

1139
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,290
<i>Your father was also a victim
of lack of justice, wasn't him?</i>

1140
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,195
<i>Did you know that it was her
that ordered the murder?</i>

1141
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:39,499
Love, my love...
my love, please forgive me!

1142
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,543
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen!

1143
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,477
Jealousy! I was jealous!
I wanted revenge...

1144
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,278
I didn't know they would go
all out until the end!

1145
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,225
But I didn't tell them to kill.
I didn't! I swear!

1146
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,057
I'm not going to leave you
alone on this!

1147
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,288
I'm going to do everything
to get you out of this mess.

1148
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,828
I've spoken with everyone.
It's just a matter of time!

1149
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,328
They are going to hang me!

1150
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,769
Listen! Listen to me.
Pay attention!

1151
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,906
You cannot argue with them!
Are you listening?

1152
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:17,205
You cannot argue with them!

1153
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:18,703
What do I do?

1154
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,911
I have it all under control.
Trust me!

1155
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:25,219
Trust me! I have to go.
Just trust me!

1156
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:29,587
What do I do?

1157
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,493
State your name.

1158
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:41,992
Danilo Maciel Porto.

1159
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,165
Bastard!
Evil!

1160
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,431
That's a lie!

1161
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,802
Order! Order!
Order in courthouse!

1162
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:54,147
If your client steps out of line
one more time, he'll be punished.

1163
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:03,657
Don't try to hide!
You can't run from the truth!

1164
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,490
Assume who you are.

1165
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:19,263
Manoel da Motta Coqueiro.

1166
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:22,471
Do you know those
that have accused you?

1167
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,431
I thought I knew.

1168
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:50,660
The prosecutor may ask
the defendant a final question.

1169
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:56,100
Mr. Motta Coqueiro,
we are really astound.

1170
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,405
Astound!

1171
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,709
Your lawyer weren't able
to provide not even one witness!

1172
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,376
No friends, no neighbors,

1173
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,145
not even your slaves came
to testify on your behalf!

1174
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:09,720
To what do you
attribute this fact?

1175
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:14,350
To injustice.

1176
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,390
Lack of justice my ass!
Killer!

1177
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,462
The prosecutor may go.

1178
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,094
Does the defender has any last
questions to ask the defendant?

1179
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:25,366
The mentor?

1180
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:28,667
Mentor...

1181
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:30,140
Mentor...

1182
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:34,806
Mr. Coqueiro, who do you
believe has ordered the massacre?

1183
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,849
I must remind you that the mentor
might be condemned with death,

1184
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:44,422
whomever she may be.

1185
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,299
Trust me.

1186
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:54,893
Mr. Coqueiro,
this is your last chance.

1187
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:03,805
I don't know who ordered
the killing of Benedito's family.

1188
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,674
Bullshit!

1189
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,481
But I am innocent!

1190
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:18,655
I would like for the jury
to state the guilty

1191
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:22,655
or innocence of
Manoel da Motta Coqueiro.

1192
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,324
Innocent!

1193
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:28,629
He's not innocent!

1194
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:32,364
Guilty! He is guilty!

1195
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,237
He is guilty!

1196
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:48,946
The defendant may go.

1197
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,060
No honorable death for you,
Mr. Motta Coqueiro.

1198
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:05,566
It hasn't been that long that
the Emperor has proclaimed a law

1199
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,436
prohibiting the torture of
the condemned prior to his death.

1200
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:13,413
<i>Fortunately, we haven't been
deprived of capital penalty.</i>

1201
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,352
<i>Death to the beast of Macabu!
Death!</i>

1202
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:01,654
Killer!

1203
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,263
Beast of Macabu!

1204
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:10,061
Manoel da Motta Coqueiro,
the Emperor Pedro II has denied

1205
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,638
the clemency wish
from your defender.

1206
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:28,914
May the sentence be executed,
and may you die a natural death.

1207
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,468
Do you have anything
to say?

1208
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:51,903
I am innocent!

1209
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:07,881
<i>"After the hanging of Manoel
da Motta Coqueiro,</i>

1210
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,489

01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,023
<i>was a victim of conspiracy

1212
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:13,886
<i>Repenting for not conceding
clemency to a condemned man</i>

1213
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:18,057
