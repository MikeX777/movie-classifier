00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,627
- THE POSTER SAID,
"JOIN THE ARMY.

00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:40,863
SEE THE WORLD."

4
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,698
I'D JUST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE

5
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:44,800
WITH NO FUTURE PLANS.

6
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:50,639
THE WORLD TURNED OUT TO BE
THE DESERTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST.

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,943
THE PERSIAN GULF WAR
HAD BEEN OVER FOR FOUR YEARS.

8
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,784
SO FAR, MY FIRST YEARS
IN THE ARMY HAD BEEN UNEVENTFUL

9
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:04,820
UNTIL NOW.

00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:14,189
CORPORAL JANIS MCKENZIE
REPORTING.

14
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,724
ARE YOU CAPTAIN BEN ROGERS?

15
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:18,293
- NO, CAPTAIN ROGERS IS
ON ASSIGNMENT.

16
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:19,828
I'M CARLYLE.

17
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,897
I SEE YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE.

18
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:24,233
- I WAS BRIEFED AT HEADQUARTERS.

19
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,935
- DO YOU HAVE A NICKNAME,
OR WILL JANIS DO?

20
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:28,270
- JANIS WILL DO.

21
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,107
- THIS IS
PRIVATE BERNARD SCHWARTZ.

22
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,610
- SCHWARTZ?

23
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:37,446
- THEY CALL ME BERNIE.

24
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,714
- WE'RE BRITISH
SPECIAL AIR SERVICES.

25
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,150
WE'RE A SECRET UNIT.

26
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,984
WE OFTEN WORK WITH DELTA FORCE.

27
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:46,988
- I KNOW SADDAM HUSSEIN
AND HIS ARMY

28
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,624
ARE THREATENING TO INVADE AGAIN.

29
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,560
BUT WHY AM I HERE?

30
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:55,464
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA BE
OUR LIAISON TO HEADQUARTERS.

31
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:56,765
GIVE HER A CLIPBOARD.

32
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,107
BUT IN THE MEANWHILE,

33
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:08,110
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU TWO TO DO.

34
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:12,381
THIS IS SECTION "D."
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DESERTED.

35
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:15,317
I WANT YOU TO GO THERE,
RECONNOITER THE ENTIRE AREA,

36
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,954
AND BRING ME BACK
A FULL RECONNAISSANCE REPORT.

37
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,222
GIVE HER THE M9.

38
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,131
[gun clicks]

39
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:31,633
NOW, YOU KEEP THAT HIDDEN.

40
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:34,636
ALL RIGHT,
YOU TWO ARE DISMISSED.

41
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:37,106
- IT SOUNDED LIKE A NICE BREAK.

42
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:40,775
SURE BEAT THE TEDIUM OF A DESK
AT ARMY INTELLIGENCE.

43
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:45,581
HOW COULD I KNOW TODAY
WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE FOREVER?

44
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:03,165
RELAX, BERNIE.

45
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,733
THIS SECTOR'S DESERTED.

46
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,335
SERGEANT SAID SO.

47
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:10,272
- I KNOW, BUT SOMETHING
JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

48
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:13,542
WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE OPEN,
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.

49
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,310
- DON'T WORRY.

50
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,379
I'LL BACK YOU UP
WITH MY CLIPBOARD.

51
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,649
- HMM, I PREFERRED YOU HAD
YOUR BERETTA LOCKED AND LOADED.

52
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,883
- OH, I GOT THAT TOO.

53
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:25,020
HEY, YOU STILL WANT A MERCEDES?

54
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,321
- [scoffs]
- [chuckles]

55
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:29,558
- JANIS, SADDAM HUSSEIN
HAS A VERY LARGE ARMY,

56
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,994
READY TO INVADE AT ANY TIME.

57
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,397
THIS IS SERIOUS.

58
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:38,167
- I KNOW.

59
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,334
TRY THE DOOR?

60
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:40,435
- UH, DON'T DO THAT.

61
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:58,187
- SAYS HERE, "AUTO REPAIR SHOP."

62
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:01,923
- [chuckles]
LOOKS LIKE A JUNKYARD.

63
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:04,560
[plastic rustling]

64
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:07,262
- I DON'T THINK SO.

65
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:18,006
UH, NOW YOU'RE GONNA RELAX?

66
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:20,742
- JANIS, HOW MANY IRAQIS
DOES IT TAKE

67
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:23,278
TO FIRE OFF A SCUD MISSILE?

68
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,614
- HOW MANY?

69
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:26,615
- THREE:

70
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:27,616
ONE TO LOAD IT,

71
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:28,783
ONE TO FIRE IT,

72
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,220
AND ONE TO WATCH NEWS TV
TO SEE WHERE IT LANDS.

73
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:36,925
[laughing]

74
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:39,695
JANIS...

75
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:42,297
UH, THAT WAS A JOKE.

76
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:45,734
- BERNIE, THIS PLACE
IS NOT DESERTED.

77
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:47,936
- WHICH COULD LEAD TO CONFLICT.

78
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:49,705
LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

79
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,210
[explosion]

80
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,181
- SADDAM HUSSEIN'S
STILL AT THE BORDER?

81
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:01,383
- 'FRAID SO.

82
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:03,118
HE WON'T INVADE.

83
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,654
- THAT'S WHAT YOU YANKS SAID
FOUR YEARS AGO.

84
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:08,890
STILL GOT MY DESERT STORM PATCH.

85
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:13,228
SO WHAT'S NEWS AT HEADQUARTERS,
CAPTAIN?

86
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,863
- I SEE YOU'RE READY.

87
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,898
- YOU KNOW, YOU DELTA GUYS,

88
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:20,335
THE MOST SECRET WELL-TRAINED
GROUP IN THE ARMY,

89
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,804
YET YOU WEAR CIVILIAN CLOTHES.

90
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:25,940
- WE HAVE TO SWIM IN A SEA
OF PEOPLE, SERGEANT MAJOR.

91
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,876
- I KNOW WHO SAID THAT.

92
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:31,045
YOU JUST GIVE ME
ONE LITTLE SECOND, AND I'LL--

93
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:36,585
OH, CORPORAL MCKENZIE REPORTED
THIS MORNING.

NOW, SHE'S NOT A DELTA OPERATOR,
IS SHE?

95
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,756
- NO, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.

96
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:44,660
SHE'LL COLLECT OUR FINDINGS
AND REPORT BACK TO HEADQUARTERS.

97
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,529
SO WHERE--
WHERE IS CORPORAL MCKENZIE?

98
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,231
- SENT HER AND SCHWARTZ
OVER TO "D" SECTION,

99
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:51,466
THE DESERTED SECTION.

100
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,835
- YOU DID WHAT?

101
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:55,504
THAT'S WHY
I WAS AT HEADQUARTERS.

102
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,972
TERRORISTS ARE MOVING
INTO THAT AREA RIGHT NOW.

103
00:07:57,973 --> 00:07:59,140
- BETTER GET OVER THERE.

104
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,720

THAT'S IT.

105
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,855
- NO!
- YES, YOU ARE.

106
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:17,125

EVERY DAY TO EARN THIS PLACE,

107
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,461
AND YOU JUST GO
AND THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY!

108
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:21,496
- GET OFF OF MY CASE.

00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:23,865
AND THAT'S IT.

111
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,634
- SHUT UP.

112
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:33,041
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

113
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,943

HOW'S SHE DOING?

168
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,669
BAD SIGN IS, SHE'S NOT GONNA
WALK FOR A FEW MONTHS.

JANIS, I'M NOT A DENTIST.

IT IS NOT MY HABIT TO PRY
INFORMATION OUT OF A PATIENT.

335
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:07,414
IF I'M TO HELP YOU,

00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:21,088
[telephone continues ringing]

355
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,894
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

356
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,065
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

357
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,969
- HEY, HEY, NONE OF THAT.

358
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,671
- KNOCK IT OFF.

359
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:38,773
- ANYMORE OF THAT CRAP,

360
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:41,675
AND YOU GUYS WILL NEVER
GET OUT OF HERE.

361
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,277
- MCKENZIE,
THEY'RE READY FOR YOU.

362
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,211
- LET'S GO.

363
00:24:56,992 --> 00:24:58,959
- YOUR BROTHER, JAMEY MCKENZIE,

364
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,796
WHERE IS HE NOW?

365
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:05,099
- PRISON.

366
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,835
- ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

367
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:55,615
CAROL AND I WENT TO CHINA
TWO YEARS AGO.

368
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:59,186
<i>THAT'S QUAN YIN,
GODDESS OF WISDOM AND MERCY.</i>

369
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:02,456
<i>SOMETIMES I THINK OF CAROL
AS QUAN YIN.</i>

370
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,590
[chuckles]

371
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:06,360
- CAROL SAID YOU HELPED HER.

372
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:10,364
- SHE DID?
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

373
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:12,867
- JUST THAT YOU HELPED HER OUT
OF A BAD TIME.

374
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:17,471
- HMM, WELL, ANYTHING ELSE,
YOU GET FROM HER.

375
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,706
- DOCTOR-PATIENT PRIVACY?

376
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:25,479
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

377
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,114
YOUR BROTHER IS UP FOR PAROLE.

378
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:29,083
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

379
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:31,752
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

380
00:26:31,753 --> 00:26:35,655
- I CHECKED, JUST NOW.

381
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:39,226
ARE YOU IN CONTACT WITH HIM?

382
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:40,995
- ALL THE TIME.

383
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:44,698
- REALLY?
THAT'S SURPRISING.

384
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,566
- NOT IN THE WAY YOU THINK.

385
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:51,171
YOU SEE, WE'RE TWINS.

386
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:54,574
SOMETIMES, I JUST KNOW
WHAT HE'S THINKING.

387
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:57,411
- WHAT IS HE THINKING?

388
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:00,981
- JANIS, I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

389
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:16,797
- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE WANTS TO KILL YOU.

390
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:18,999
- MY TESTIMONY SENT HIM TO JAIL.

391
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,002
- WELL, THAT WOULD'VE
HAPPENED ANYWAY.

392
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:25,272
- HE DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

393
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:33,914
- DO YOU DREAM AT NIGHT?

394
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,916
- NIGHTMARES.

395
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,185
- DO THEY CONCERN YOUR BROTHER?

396
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,995
- I GET THESE
ABOUT ONCE A MONTH.

397
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:57,337
JAMEY KILLED MY PARENTS--

398
00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:59,640
- WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE.

399
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:02,843
- AND HE'LL TRY AND KILL ME
WITH THE SAME WEAPON.

400
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:07,615
- WHAT ABOUT THE TRUCK?

401
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:09,950
WAS JAMEY INVOLVED IN THAT?

402
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:12,553
- WARNINGS.

403
00:28:12,554 --> 00:28:15,756
YOU SEE, JAMEY THINKS
HE'S MESSING WITH MY HEAD,

404
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:18,559
BUT HE'S NOT,

405
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,829
'CAUSE I KNOW HE WANTS
TO KILL ME HIMSELF.

406
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:30,404
[telephone ringing]

407
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:32,472
- I DON'T THINK HE LIKES YOU.

408
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:39,613
HOW MUCH TIME YOU DOING?

409
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:41,381
- 20 YEARS.

410
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:43,817
- DAMN, BOY, WHAT'D YOU DO?

411
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:53,493
- I SLICED, DICED, AND FILLETED
MY PARENTS WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE.

412
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:59,567
WHAT DID YOU DO?

413
00:28:59,568 --> 00:29:01,936
- STOLE A CAR.

414
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:05,940
- SO HE SENDS YOU THESE THINGS
ONCE A MONTH.

415
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:07,374
MAY I KEEP THIS?

416
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,209
- HOW MANY DO YOU WANT?

417
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,911
I HAVE A WHOLE BOX FULL OF 'EM.

418
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:15,348
- ONE IS SUFFICIENT.

419
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,951
GET TO KNOW CAROL.

420
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:20,654
DON'T LET THAT TEXAS BRAVADO
FOOL YOU.

421
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:24,357
SHE HAS A WAY OF RECOGNIZING
PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP.

422
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:26,259
- BECAUSE I'M DIFFERENT?

423
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,596
- DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DIFFERENT?

424
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:32,165
- YEAH.

425
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,401
- NO, YOU'RE NOT DIFFERENT.

426
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:38,072
THE WORLD IS FULL OF PEOPLE
LIKE YOU.

427
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:42,342
AS A CHILD, YOU EXPERIENCED
A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

428
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:45,613
YOU LACKED THE EMOTIONAL
MATURITY TO DEAL WITH IT.

429
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:48,782
CONSEQUENTLY, YOU BECAME
AN EMOTIONAL VICTIM.

430
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:57,190
- I WILL NOT BE A VICTIM.

431
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,259
- AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

432
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,831
TOSS JAMEY OUT OF A WINDOW?

433
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:06,734
- SINCE I WAS 16 YEARS OLD,

434
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:10,370
I'VE KNOWN MY BROTHER
WOULD COME FOR ME.

435
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,740
I'M READY.

436
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:21,348
- JANIS, DO YOU LIKE YOURSELF?

437
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,150
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE?

438
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,653
WOULD YOU CHANGE?

439
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:31,725
- I LIVE WITH DEMONS, DOCTOR.

440
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:35,295
NIGHTMARES AT NIGHT,

441
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:38,598
SINISTER SHADOWS BY DAY.

442
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:44,237
YEAH, I WOULD LIKE FOR THAT
TO CHANGE.

443
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:47,307
BUT HOW DO YOU
GET RID OF DEMONS?

444
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:50,010
- YOU DON'T FEED THEM.

445
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:56,216
[telephone ringing]

446
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:57,217
EXCUSE ME.

447
00:30:57,218 --> 00:31:00,788
[telephone ringing]

448
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:02,556
HELLO?

449
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:06,226
CAROL, YES, MM-HMM.

450
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:07,360
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

451
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:13,500
GOOD, MM-HMM,
OKAY, YEAH, BYE.

452
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,634
THAT WAS CAROL.

453
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:26,279
THIS IS YOUR PRESCRIPTION.

454
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,315
- YOU CAN'T WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS.

455
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:30,718
- TAKE THIS.

456
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:38,158
[sighs]

457
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:48,936
- OKAY.

458
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:51,271
I'LL SEE YOU SOON, DOCTOR.

459
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:52,840
- OKAY.

460
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:19,233
- HEY, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D COME.

461
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,334
- DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

462
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:25,839
- TENNIS WITH CAROL
THREE TIMES A WEEK,

463
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,274

BYE.

GOOD TO SEE SOME FRESH BLOOD

- I HOPE YOU TOLD HER

484
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:10,250
THAT WE PLAY FOR
SOME PRETTY HIGH STAKES.

485
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,919
- OH, YOU BETCHA, YOU KNOW,

486
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,620
DRINKS AT THE BAR,
AND THE LOSER PAYS.

487

[laughter]

488
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:17,757
- WELL, I'M GONNA GO CHANGE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:19,693
- BYE, MALIBU BARBIE.

00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:20,994
- TOODLES.

491
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:23,997
- COME BACK AS TENNIS BARBIE.

492
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:25,432
YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING'S GONNA MATCH.

493
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:26,900
- I KNOW THERE'S PINK SHOES

494
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,669
- OH, YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

495

- YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES,
MCKENZIE.

496
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:50,023
[rotary dialer hissing]

497
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,702

- COOL AS AN ICE CUBE, MAN.

503
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:20,988
CLASSIC IT WAS.

504
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,389
TOO BAD YOU WEREN'T THERE.

505
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,824

00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:39,940
I MEAN, SHE JUST LOOKED AT ME.

A TOUGH LITTLE...

513
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,312
[mouthing words]

514
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,480
GIRL.

LOOKS LIKE I GOT TO GO.
GOOD-BYE.

516
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,358

517
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:01,128

00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,002
- HA, DRINKIN' RUM
AND COCA-COLA.

522
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:11,838
- [laughs] WE HAVE SOMETHING
DIFFERENT EVERY TIME.

523
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,808
- HOW ABOUT SOMETHING SPECIAL?

524
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:16,310
- LIKE A SURPRISE?
- UH-HUH.

525
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,312

- DON'T PANIC.
I'VE HAD HIS SURPRISES BEFORE.

528
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,783
- I KNEW YOU WERE COMING.

529
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:26,719
- THAT'S NOT LEMONADE.
- THAT'S NOT LEMONADE.

530
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,489
- WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT?

531
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,492
ALL RIGHT, HERE IS

<i>I'M WORKING
FOR SRQ MAGAZINE TODAY.</i>

712
00:51:56,276 --> 00:51:58,410
- DOES THAT MEAN
ANYONE CAN HIRE YOU?

713
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:01,013
- UH-HUH.

714
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:05,317
- HEY, LET ME TAKE YOU TO LUNCH.

715
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:09,655
NO, NO, SORRY, SORRY, NO, NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN--LOOK,

716
00:52:09,656 --> 00:52:13,492
YOU KNOW, I'M A WRITER.

717
00:52:13,493 --> 00:52:16,729
I'M PLANNING A SPECIAL BOOK
ABOUT SARASOTA.

718
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,164
- WHAT HAVE YOU WRITTEN?

719
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:21,467
- FIVE NOVELS.

720
00:52:21,468 --> 00:52:23,269
- I'M IMPRESSED.
- DON'T BE.

721
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:28,207
THEY'RE ALL IN A DRAWER
WITH 73 REJECTION LETTERS.

722
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,243
BUT NOW, THIS BOOK
ABOUT SARASOTA

723
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:32,078
COULD BE MY BREAKTHROUGH.

724
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,612
- HMM.

725
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:35,714
JANIS MCKENZIE.

726
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:39,718
- HEY, DIDN'T I SEE YOUR NAME
ON A BOOK?

727
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,254
<i>- BEHIND THE MYSTERY?</i>

728
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:44,157
- YES, I LOVE MYSTERIES.

729
00:52:44,158 --> 00:52:45,324
- I DID THE PHOTOGRAPHY.

730
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:46,759
STUART KAMINSKY
DID THE NARRATIVE.

731
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,828
- OH, KAMINSKY'S THE BEST.

732
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:51,530
NOW, YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO DO WITH THIS BOOK,

733
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:54,366
ONLY ABOUT SARASOTA,
ITS PEOPLE AND PLACES.

734
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:56,568
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

735
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:59,571
- WELL, IF YOU'RE WILLING,
I'VE FOUND MY PHOTOGRAPHER.

736
00:52:59,572 --> 00:53:01,674
- YOU'VE FOUND HER.
- ALL RIGHT.

737
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:04,510
- HERE, LET ME GIVE YOU A CARD.
- OKAY.

738
00:53:04,511 --> 00:53:06,946
- GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN YOU WANT TO GET STARTED.

739
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:08,181
- YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

740
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:09,849
- ALL RIGHT,
TAKE CARE OF THAT KNEE.

741
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:10,783
BE CAREFUL.

742
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:27,900
HERE WE ARE.

743
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:29,568
- WAIT, YOU LIVE ON A BOAT?

744
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:31,737
- YEAH.
- TOO COOL.

745
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:33,840
- COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.

746
00:53:37,144 --> 00:53:38,610
- AWESOME.

747
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:43,182
- OKAY, NOW, WATCH YOUR STEP,
SINCE THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME.

748
00:53:43,183 --> 00:53:45,517
JUMP.
- WHOO!

749
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:52,191
[laughter]

750
00:53:52,192 --> 00:53:53,993
- LITTLE MORE WINE, CAROL?

751
00:53:53,994 --> 00:53:56,628
- UH, LICK THAT UP,
YOU SPILLED IT.

752
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:58,664
- [laughs]

753
00:53:58,665 --> 00:54:00,666
THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE
BOTTLE OF WINE.

754
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:03,202
- OH, HERE IS TO GOOD FRIENDS--

755
00:54:03,203 --> 00:54:04,971
- GOOD FRIENDS.
- TONIGHT IS KIND OF SPECIAL.

756
00:54:04,972 --> 00:54:05,905
[laughter]

757
00:54:07,941 --> 00:54:13,412
- LIKE, I'M TALKING
ABOUT A HUGE PERSON...

758
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:15,047
CAROL, GET YOUR MIND
OUT OF THE GUTTER.

759
00:54:15,048 --> 00:54:16,548
- IT'S NOWHERE IN THE GUTTER.

760
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:17,583
NEVER IN THE GUTTER.

761
00:54:17,584 --> 00:54:18,684
CLEAN CAROL.

762
00:54:18,685 --> 00:54:19,718
[laughter]

763
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:26,558
- LET ME GET THE UMBRELLA
FOR YOU.

764
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,327
- OKAY.

765
00:54:30,364 --> 00:54:32,464
IT'S JUST ABOUT TO POUR.

766
00:54:32,465 --> 00:54:34,733
- BE CAREFUL.
- THANK YOU.

767
00:54:34,734 --> 00:54:35,834
IT WAS FUN.
- IT WAS.

768
00:54:35,835 --> 00:54:37,436
- BYE...
- WE'LL DO IT AGAIN SOON.

769
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:39,705
- OKAY.
- BYE.

770
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:44,810
- [screaming]

771
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:46,178
[knife clattering]

772
00:55:05,632 --> 00:55:06,865
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES.

773
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:08,467
- WHERE'D IT HAPPEN?

774
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:10,803
- ON THE DECK.
HE HAD A BUTCHER KNIFE.

775
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:13,739
- I'M GONNA GO
AND CHECK FOR FINGERPRINTS.

776
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,042
OKAY?
- OKAY.

777
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:17,977
- TAKE CARE OF HER.

778
00:55:27,387 --> 00:55:30,323
[thunder rumbling]

779
00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:37,997
[sirens wailing distantly]

780
00:55:37,998 --> 00:55:39,332
- [hyperventilating]

781
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:43,269
- NO, NO, IT'S OKAY,
BACKUP'S ON THE WAY.

782
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,237
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL THEM?

783
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:47,406
- THAT SOMEBODY TRIED
TO KILL ME?

784
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:50,776
- ACTUALLY,
SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL JANIS.

785
00:55:50,777 --> 00:55:51,844
THIS IS HER BOAT.

786
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:55,647
THEY ALMOST GOT YOU BY MISTAKE.

787
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:59,718
- I THINK IT'S TIME I TOLD
YOU GUYS ABOUT MY BROTHER.

788
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:02,654
[sirens wailing]

789
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,969
- OKAY, THAT ONE RIGHT THERE.

790
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,509
OKAY.

791
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,211
OKAY, LOOK,
I'VE TRIED THIS FIVE TIMES.

792
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:26,945
I DON'T GET IT.

793
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:30,082
- THAT'S BECAUSE...

794
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:33,819
- [chuckles] AMAZING.

795
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,922
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

796
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:39,758
YOUR TIME IN PRISON WASN'T
TOTALLY SQUANDERED, WAS IT?

797
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:43,095
- JAMEY MCKENZIE
INTRODUCED ME TO THIS GUY,

798
00:56:43,096 --> 00:56:45,231
COST ME 300 BIG ONES.

799
00:56:45,232 --> 00:56:46,732
- AND YOU LEARNED THIS TRICK?

800
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:51,003
- NO, I LOST $300 GAMBLING.

801
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:53,139
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE LAUGHED
AT ME, THOUGH.

802
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,274
I SLAMMED HIS FACE
AGAINST THE WALL

803
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:56,775
AND MADE HIM TEACH ME.

804
00:56:56,776 --> 00:57:00,212
- [chuckles]
WELL, A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT,

805
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:02,181
IF I SAY SO MYSELF.

806
00:57:02,182 --> 00:57:03,582
THOUGH WITH
WHAT JAMEY MCKENZIE'S

807
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:04,850
GONNA BE PAYING US,

808
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,685
THIS SHOULD BE
A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

809
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:10,122
IN OUR REVENUE STREAM.

810
00:57:10,123 --> 00:57:12,124
- REVENUE STREAM?

811
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:15,428
- LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.

812
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:16,429
[knock at door]

813
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,396
GET THE DOOR.

814
00:57:27,307 --> 00:57:28,574
WHOA, WHOA,

815
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,443
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

816
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:32,611
- AH, COULDN'T HELP IT, BOSS.

817
00:57:32,612 --> 00:57:33,712
- SHE HIT ME IN THE BALLS.

818
00:57:33,713 --> 00:57:34,980
- WITH AN UMBRELLA!

819
00:57:34,981 --> 00:57:38,817
WITH A STUPID LITTLE UMBRELLA.

820
00:57:38,818 --> 00:57:40,052
- ACTUALLY, IT WAS QUITE LARGE.

821
00:57:40,053 --> 00:57:42,988
- SHUT UP!

822
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:46,992
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO SCARE JANIS.

823
00:57:46,993 --> 00:57:48,360
- AHH...

824
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:51,897
- NOT MAKE HER LAUGH.

825
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:13,051
[camera clicking]

826
00:58:18,024 --> 00:58:20,959
[camera clicking]

827
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:40,212
- CORPORAL MCKENZIE.

828
00:58:45,185 --> 00:58:46,785
- CAPTAIN ROGERS?

829
00:58:46,786 --> 00:58:49,988
- COLONEL ROGERS.
I'VE BEEN PROMOTED.

830
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:57,163
- CONGRATULATIONS, COLONEL.

831
00:58:57,164 --> 00:59:00,799
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

832
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,735
- IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

833
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:07,273
I WASN'T SURE
YOU'D WANT TO SEE ME.

834
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:09,908
- FOUR MONTHS
IN THAT ARMY HOSPITAL--

835
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:11,510
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO CARED.

836
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:14,079
- WE ALL WORRIED
YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE IT.

837
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,217
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
I'M TOUGH.

838
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:23,656
- [chuckles]
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

839
00:59:25,992 --> 00:59:28,093
- I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN CAREFULLY,

840
00:59:28,094 --> 00:59:31,963
BECAUSE THIS IS VERY SIMPLE.

841
00:59:31,964 --> 00:59:34,032
YOU GOT THE CHLOROFORM?

842
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:35,033
- UH-HUH.

843
00:59:35,034 --> 00:59:37,002
- YEAH?
GOOD.

844
00:59:37,003 --> 00:59:38,937
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE MARINA.

845
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:41,473
YOU'RE GONNA WAIT FOR JANIS.

846
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:43,309
YOU'RE GONNA GRAB HER.

847
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:46,144
YOU'RE GONNA CHLOROFORM HER.

848
00:59:46,145 --> 00:59:47,713
YOU'RE GONNA TIE HER UP,

849
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:51,684
AND YOU'RE GONNA WAIT FOR ME
TO GET THERE.

850
00:59:51,685 --> 00:59:54,353
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT, GUYS?

851
00:59:54,354 --> 00:59:55,454
- SURE, WE CAN DO THAT.

852
00:59:55,455 --> 00:59:56,722
- ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN DO THAT?

853
00:59:56,723 --> 00:59:59,124
- YES.
- YEAH?

854
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:00,326
GOOD.

855
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:02,561
- DON'T MESS THIS UP.

856
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:03,995
- GOT IT.

857
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:07,799
- SO HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME?

858
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,436
- YOUR FRIEND CAROL DODD TOLD ME
YOU WERE DOING A PHOTO SHOOT

859
01:00:10,437 --> 01:00:11,970
AT JUNGLE GARDEN.

860
01:00:11,971 --> 01:00:14,640
- INTERESTING.

861
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:17,343
AN ARMY COLONEL,
INTELLIGENCE BRANCH--

862
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:19,177
YOU ARE STILL INTELLIGENCE,
RIGHT?

863
01:00:19,178 --> 01:00:20,178
- RIGHT.

864
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:22,013
- WHO JUST HAPPENS
TO PASS THROUGH

865
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:27,353
A COZY FLORIDA BEACH TOWN
AND RUNS INTO AN OLD FRIEND

866
01:00:27,354 --> 01:00:29,955
AT THE JUNGLE GARDENS?

867
01:00:29,956 --> 01:00:31,022
COME ON.

868
01:00:31,023 --> 01:00:33,726
WHAT GIVES, COLONEL?

869
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:38,096
- [sighs] TEN YEARS AGO,

870
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:39,765
YOU HAD A SHOOT-OUT
WITH FIVE TERRORISTS

871
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,300
ON A BACK STREET IN KUWAIT.

872
01:00:44,704 --> 01:00:47,139
- AND A YOUNG AMERICAN PRIVATE
WAS KILLED.

873
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,409
- MM-HMM,
PRIVATE BERNARD SCHWARTZ.

874
01:00:53,446 --> 01:00:55,648
- BERNIE WAS A GOOD KID.

875
01:00:55,649 --> 01:00:58,250
- YES, HE WAS.

876
01:00:58,251 --> 01:01:04,790
GRAY'S REGISTRATION FOUND
FOUR DEAD TERRORISTS, NOT FIVE.

877
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:05,924
COULD WE HAVE MISCOUNTED?

878
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:11,897
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

879
01:01:11,898 --> 01:01:14,132
- SCHWARTZ'S IDENTIFICATION
DISAPPEARED.

880
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:18,270
FOR A LONG TIME, HE WAS LISTED
AS MISSING IN ACTION.

881
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:19,571
- SO WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?

882
01:01:19,572 --> 01:01:20,839
- IT MATTERED.

883
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,809
SCHWARTZ RECENTLY ENTERED
THE UNITED STATES,

884
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:28,580
OR SOMEBODY WHO CLAIMS TO BE
BERNARD SCHWARTZ.

885
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,183
- FORGED PASSPORT?

886
01:01:31,184 --> 01:01:32,584
WHERE IS HE NOW?

887
01:01:32,585 --> 01:01:35,187
- WELL, WE TRAILED HIM
FROM KUWAIT TO FLORIDA.

888
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:36,755
APPARENTLY,
HE CHANGED HIS APPEARANCE

889
01:01:36,756 --> 01:01:38,256
BEFORE HE DISEMBARKED IN MIAMI.

890
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:41,393
WE LOST HIM.

891
01:01:41,394 --> 01:01:43,295
- THAT'S TWICE YOU'VE SAID "WE."

892
01:01:43,296 --> 01:01:46,598

OF HOMELAND SECURITY.

893
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:48,701

894
01:01:48,702 --> 01:01:52,270
- JANIS, THIS MAN,
HE'S SWORN TO KILL YOU.

895
01:01:52,271 --> 01:01:53,772
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

896
01:01:53,773 --> 01:01:57,309
- WE HAVE INFORMANTS.

897
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:59,077
DO YOU REMEMBER
SERGEANT BRONSON?

898
01:01:59,078 --> 01:02:02,981
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
HE WAS YOUR SERGEANT IN KUWAIT.

899
01:02:02,982 --> 01:02:05,283
- YES.

900
01:02:05,284 --> 01:02:07,986
KADIR MURDERED HIM
THREE YEARS AGO.

901
01:02:07,987 --> 01:02:12,891
HE BLAMES YOU AND BRONSON
FOR THE DEATHS OF HIS RELATIVES.

902
01:02:12,892 --> 01:02:17,195
JANIS, THIS MAN IS COMING
TO KILL YOU.

903
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:21,266
- WELL, TELL HIM TO GET IN LINE.

904
01:02:27,173 --> 01:02:29,107

COME ON.

905
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:31,410
LET'S GET A DRINK.

908
01:02:41,187 --> 01:02:42,721
- A SODA?

909
01:02:42,722 --> 01:02:43,789
MARIE...

910
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,156
- IT'S BEFORE 5:00.

911
01:02:48,862 --> 01:02:50,396
I SPOKE TO CAROL.

912
01:02:50,397 --> 01:02:52,498
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE RECOVERED.

913
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:58,370
JANIS?
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

914
01:02:58,371 --> 01:02:59,538
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THIS

915
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:02,541
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN"
LOOK.

916
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:03,609
- I'M SORRY, MY MIND--

917
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:06,945
IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE ELSE
RIGHT NOW.

918
01:03:06,946 --> 01:03:10,549
- JAMEY WAS RELEASED
FROM PRISON YESTERDAY.

919
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,884
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

920
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:14,219
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

921
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,220
- I'M GONNA WAIT.

922
01:03:15,221 --> 01:03:16,922
- YOU'RE GONNA WAIT FOR JAMEY?

923
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:20,292
JANIS, JAMEY IS A KILLER.

924
01:03:20,293 --> 01:03:23,028
- SO AM I.

925
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:32,203
- IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO TELL ME?

926
01:03:32,204 --> 01:03:36,809
- I'M BEING FOLLOWED,

927
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:39,445
AND IT'S NOT JAMEY.

928
01:03:39,446 --> 01:03:42,748

- SURE.

932
01:03:54,627 --> 01:03:57,162
- SORRY, DID I FRIGHTEN YOU?

933
01:03:57,163 --> 01:04:02,568
- NO.
I KNEW YOU WERE THERE.

934
01:04:02,569 --> 01:04:03,936
- BRILLIANT.

935
01:04:03,937 --> 01:04:05,504
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT
FOR THE BOOK.

- GOOD.

937
01:04:06,606 --> 01:04:08,540

PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, HUH?

01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:41,540
WAR'S OVER.
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

01:05:56,216 --> 01:05:58,283
- WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE LUNCH.

01:06:01,554 --> 01:06:03,722
I'M WAITING ON...

967
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:05,591
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT.

- ALL RIGHT.

970
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:13,932
I THINK JANIS IS
INTO SOME TROUBLE.

971
01:06:13,933 --> 01:06:16,201
THERE'S A TERRORIST COMING IN
FROM KUWAIT TO KILL HER.

972
01:06:16,202 --> 01:06:17,869
LOOK, I'LL EXPLAIN MORE LATER.

JUST DON'T BREATHE
A WORD OF THIS TO ANYBODY.

974
01:06:20,206 --> 01:06:23,509
HOMELAND SECURITY THINKS
HE'S ALREADY HERE.

975
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:26,478
- I UNDERSTAND.

976
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:31,517

ARE YOU ALWAYS LIKE THIS?

981
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:58,477
MOST WOMEN BY NOW
HAVE A MILLION QUESTIONS.

982
01:06:58,478 --> 01:06:59,478
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

983
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:02,113
LIKE, WHAT DO YOU DO?

984
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,551

AND YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.

990
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,401
- VERY GOOD.

991
01:07:22,402 --> 01:07:24,403
PERFECT, IN FACT.

HOW ABOUT DINNER?

01:08:08,848 --> 01:08:11,783
HEY, BOOMER.
- HI, JANIS.

1002
01:08:11,784 --> 01:08:13,918
- YOU'RE ALWAYS POLISHING MUGS.

- REALLY?
OH, "BOOMER."

1008
01:08:24,163 --> 01:08:25,497
- MM-HMM.

1009
01:08:25,498 --> 01:08:27,466
- THAT'S QUITE A NAME
FOR A BARTENDER.

1010
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:30,135
- HEY, I WASN'T ALWAYS
A BARTENDER.

1011
01:08:30,136 --> 01:08:32,404
WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS
A PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER,

1013
01:08:33,573 --> 01:08:36,107
USED TO HIT THE LONG BALL,
YOU KNOW?

1014
01:08:36,108 --> 01:08:38,209
OUT OF THE PARK.

1015
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,111
THAT'S WHY I GOT THE NAME,
BOOMER.

1016
01:08:40,112 --> 01:08:41,880
- SO WHY'D YOU QUIT?

1017
01:08:41,881 --> 01:08:44,949
- PITCHERS FOUND OUT
I COULDN'T HIT A CURVE BALL.

1018
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:54,326
- SHE'S AT THE BAR...

1019
01:08:54,327 --> 01:08:56,828
TALKING TO THE BARTENDER.

1020
01:08:56,829 --> 01:08:57,829
- TALKING?

JANIS THE MUTE?

1022
01:08:59,365 --> 01:09:01,266
WELL, THAT WON'T LAST LONG.

- I'VE GOT THE CHLOROFORM.

1024

- YOU KNOW
WHAT I TOLD YOU TO DO,

1025
01:09:05,738 --> 01:09:06,871
YOU NEED TO DO IT QUICK.

1026
01:09:06,872 --> 01:09:08,540
WHEN SHE COMES DOWN THE LADDER--
- I GOT IT.

1027
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:09,541
- UNDERSTAND?
- I GOT IT.

1028
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:10,809
IF I MISS, SHE'LL KICK MY ASS.

1029
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:12,577
- DAMN RIGHT, SHE'LL KICK
YOUR ASS, COME ON.

1030
01:09:12,578 --> 01:09:15,113
COME ON, WE GOT TO GET TO
THE BOAT BEFORE JANIS DOES.

1035
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:26,858
- COMING RIGHT UP.

1036
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:27,826
- ALL RIGHT.

[telephone ringing]

1038
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:55,086
- ABE, GO HOME.

1039
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:56,988
ARREST SOMEBODY.

1040
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,425
STOP LOITERING
BY THE FAX MACHINE.

1041
01:10:03,563 --> 01:10:07,131
HEY, LISTEN,
IF THE FAX COMES IN,

1042
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:08,800
I'LL CALL YOU.

1043
01:10:11,904 --> 01:10:13,905
- DO YOU STILL HATE ME?

1044
01:10:13,906 --> 01:10:17,909
- I NEVER HATED YOU.

1045
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,178
- YOU SHOULD HAVE.

1046
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:25,751
- I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

1047
01:10:25,752 --> 01:10:28,720
I THOUGHT WE WERE IN LOVE.

1048
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:33,291
- WE WERE.

1049
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:35,494
I STILL AM.

1050
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:46,104
I BOUGHT AN ENGAGEMENT RING
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

1051
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:49,674
- REALLY?

1052
01:10:49,675 --> 01:10:52,210
WELL, I HOPE YOU GOT
A FULL REFUND.

1053
01:10:55,648 --> 01:10:58,550
- THAT SAME NIGHT,

1054
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:02,554
TWO MEN IN SUITS
CAME TO MY DOOR.

1055
01:11:02,555 --> 01:11:04,088
THEY SAID...

1056
01:11:04,089 --> 01:11:06,525
- EMILIO VARGAS?

1057
01:11:06,526 --> 01:11:09,628
YOU HAVE 30 MINUTES TO PACK.

1058
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:11,830
- HE HAD THE WRONG PERSON.

1059
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:14,065
- NO.

1060
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:17,101
MY SUPERIORS CREATED
A NEW IDENTITY FOR ME.

1061
01:11:19,806 --> 01:11:25,544
I WAS GOING UNDERCOVER
IN A NEW COUNTRY.

1062
01:11:25,545 --> 01:11:26,878
- WHY YOU?

1063
01:11:26,879 --> 01:11:32,317
- NO FAMILY, FLUENT IN SPANISH,

1064
01:11:32,318 --> 01:11:35,821
AND I WAS TRAINED.

1065
01:11:35,822 --> 01:11:38,189
- [sighs]

1066
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:41,793
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

1067
01:11:41,794 --> 01:11:45,196
- NO COMMUNICATIONS ALLOWED...

1068
01:11:45,197 --> 01:11:46,698
WITH ANYBODY.

1069
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:50,669
THEN JUST AS I WAS TO COME HOME,

1070
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,471
I WAS DISCOVERED.

1071
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:54,539
MY CAPTORS DIDN'T TAKE KINDLY
TO MY DECEPTION.

1072
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:01,847
THEY TORTURED ME
FOR THREE YEARS.

1073
01:12:01,848 --> 01:12:04,415
WHEN I ESCAPED,

1074
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:07,352
I HID OUT IN THE JUNGLE
FOR THREE MORE YEARS.

1075
01:12:07,353 --> 01:12:10,722
I WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE
WHEN I FINALLY GOT RESCUED.

1076
01:12:10,723 --> 01:12:17,428
AND THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME
ALIVE WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU.

1077
01:12:19,365 --> 01:12:21,900
I DIDN'T GET A REFUND.

1078
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:44,722
I'VE NEVER STOPPED LOVING YOU.

1079
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,258
I MISSED YOU.

1080
01:13:37,343 --> 01:13:39,444

1083
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,111
- GOOD MORNING.

1084
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:20,451
- GOOD MORNING.

1085
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:27,292
YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

1086
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:32,196
- I HAVE TO GO.

1087
01:14:32,197 --> 01:14:35,833
- NO, DON'T GO, JANIS.
DON'T GO.

1088
01:14:35,834 --> 01:14:38,803
- I JUST HAVE TO GET
A COUPLE THINGS FROM MY BOAT.

1089
01:14:38,804 --> 01:14:41,306
AND THEN I'LL BE BACK.

1090
01:14:56,422 --> 01:14:59,357
[pen tapping]

1091
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:05,697
- YOU CAN'T STILL BE ON DUTY.

1092
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:11,001
- DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M STILL ON DUTY?

1093
01:15:11,002 --> 01:15:14,572
- THIS WHO
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR?

1094
01:15:14,573 --> 01:15:16,307
WHO'S THIS GUY?

1095
01:15:16,308 --> 01:15:17,775
- HE'S A TERRORIST.

1096
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:20,177
AND HE MAY BE IN SARASOTA.

1097
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:34,258
- SON OF A BITCH.

1098
01:15:34,259 --> 01:15:36,160
MAX!

1099
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,261
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

1100
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:39,163
- WHERE IS SHE?
IS SHE HERE?

1101
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:40,164
- SHE'S NOT HERE.
- AHH...

1102
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:42,600
- GET OUT OF HERE.
- HEY, DAMN.

1103
01:15:42,601 --> 01:15:44,402
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
- WHERE'S SHE AT?

1104
01:15:44,403 --> 01:15:45,403
OW.

1105
01:15:45,404 --> 01:15:47,572
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD...

1106
01:15:47,573 --> 01:15:50,241
- HEY, SWEETIE.
JUST PULLED UP.

1107
01:15:50,242 --> 01:15:55,580
OKAY, I'LL BE UP IN JUST
A COUPLE MINUTES, ALL RIGHT?

1108
01:15:55,581 --> 01:15:58,549
YEAH, RIGHT, SWEETHEART,
I GOT TO GO, BYE.

- OH!

1111
01:16:12,898 --> 01:16:16,601
- I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, THINKING
YOU'RE GONNA COME INTO MY TOWN.

1112
01:16:16,602 --> 01:16:18,002
BUT YOU GOT THE WRONG TOWN.

1113
01:16:18,003 --> 01:16:20,137
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE?

1114
01:16:20,138 --> 01:16:21,606
- OH, SAVE IT.

1115
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:22,840
- THANKS, PAL.

1116
01:16:27,646 --> 01:16:32,149
- THE PLAN WAS SO SIMPLE.

1117
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,786
I WANTED JANIS TO SUFFER.

1118
01:16:34,787 --> 01:16:36,888
I WANTED TO INTIMIDATE HER.

1119
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:41,191
I WANTED TO SCARE HER.

1120
01:16:41,192 --> 01:16:42,593
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

1121
01:16:42,594 --> 01:16:45,930
YOU GUYS MAKE LIKE
THE THREE STOOGES.

1122
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:52,102
- BUT THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US.

1123
01:16:52,103 --> 01:16:54,238
- WHAT?

1124
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:58,275
- WELL, THERE'S THREE STOOGES,
AND DAD AND I--

1125
01:16:58,276 --> 01:17:00,377
WE'RE, LIKE, TWO.

1126
01:17:00,378 --> 01:17:04,449
- SHUT UP, MAX.
JUST SHUT UP.

1127
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,884
JAMEY IS QUITE RIGHT.

1128
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:12,089
PERHAPS WE SHOULD'VE PLANNED
A MORE VIABLE LINE OF ATTACK.

1129
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:19,330
- WHAT IF JANIS HAS AN ACCIDENT?

1130
01:17:19,331 --> 01:17:22,366
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1131
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:30,808
- WHAT IF...
JANIS HAS AN ACCIDENT?

1132
01:17:30,809 --> 01:17:33,678
- JANIS HAS AN ACCIDENT.

1133

JANIS HAS AN ACCIDENT.

1135
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:54,499
- JANIS HAS AN ACCIDENT.

1136
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,333
- THAT'S NOT BAD FOR A HALF-WIT.

1137
01:17:56,334 --> 01:17:59,737
- THANKS, BOSS.

1138
01:17:59,738 --> 01:18:03,240

[camera clicking]

1157
01:20:02,193 --> 01:20:05,162
- YOU COULD'VE WALKED AWAY
THAT DAY.

1158
01:20:05,163 --> 01:20:07,464
YOU COULD'VE SAID,

1159
01:20:07,465 --> 01:20:10,534
"I SAW NOTHING," BUT NO.

1160
01:20:10,535 --> 01:20:13,604
YOU HAD TO TELL, DIDN'T YOU?

1161
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:17,842
- YOU KILLED OUR PARENTS, JAMEY.

1162

WORLD WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

1250
01:27:30,775 --> 01:27:34,978
HERE'S JAMEY'S PICTURE.

1251
01:27:34,979 --> 01:27:38,815
- NASTY-LOOKING AS HOMEMADE SIN.

1252
01:27:38,816 --> 01:27:39,983
WATCH OUT FOR THAT CREEP.

1253
01:27:39,984 --> 01:27:41,552
- I WISH IT WERE THAT SIMPLE.

1254
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:44,588
THERE'S A SECOND MAN
TRYING TO KILL JANIS.

1255
01:27:44,589 --> 01:27:47,491
JANIS.

1256
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:49,359
- IT HAPPENED
DURING THE GULF WAR.

1257
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,360
KUWAIT,

1258
01:27:50,361 --> 01:27:52,529

1259
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:53,997

- YEP, CORPORAL JANIS MCKENZIE.

1261
01:27:59,137 --> 01:28:00,737

- JANIS WAS IN A FIREFIGHT
WITH A TERRORIST NAMED KADIR

1263

AND FOUR RELATIVES.

1264
01:28:05,243 --> 01:28:08,145
ALL DIED EXCEPT KADIR.

1265
01:28:08,146 --> 01:28:10,113
- AND NOW HE'S HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES

1266
01:28:10,114 --> 01:28:13,551
UNDER A FORGED PASSPORT GOING BY
THE NAME OF BERNARD SCHWARTZ.

1267
01:28:13,552 --> 01:28:15,953
- FAKE DATES, FAKE PICTURE.

1268
01:28:15,954 --> 01:28:17,755
- WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

1269
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:21,492
- DARK SKIN, BEARD, BROWN EYES.

1270
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:22,993

HE'S A MASTER OF DISGUISES.

1272
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:26,597
THANKS TO A HIDDEN CAMERA
IN MIAMI,

1273
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:27,731
WE KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE NOW.

1274
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:36,974
- OH, MY GOD.

1275
01:28:36,975 --> 01:28:41,078

- YEAH, ALIAS "KADIR."

1279
01:28:55,226 --> 01:28:58,095
- JANIS, YOU SPENT LAST WEEK
WITH THAT MAN.

1280
01:28:58,096 --> 01:28:59,630
WHY DIDN'T HE KILL YOU THEN?

1281
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:02,800
- I DON'T KNOW.

1282
01:29:02,801 --> 01:29:05,202
- THE CAT PLAYING WITH HIS PREY.

1283
01:29:05,203 --> 01:29:06,770
- DO ANY OF YOU HAVE GUNS?

1284
01:29:06,771 --> 01:29:08,739
- I DO,
AND I KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

1285
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:09,807
- WELL, I DON'T.

1286
01:29:09,808 --> 01:29:11,208
ABE.
- CAROL, NO.

1287
01:29:11,209 --> 01:29:12,943
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
GETTING YOURSELF SHOT.

1288
01:29:12,944 --> 01:29:15,145
WE'RE GONNA BE
TAKING CARE OF IT.

1289
01:29:15,146 --> 01:29:16,714
FEDERAL AGENTS
ARE COMING IN TOMORROW.

1290
01:29:16,715 --> 01:29:18,048
RIGHT, BEN?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

1291
01:29:18,049 --> 01:29:20,283
- WE ALREADY ARRESTED
THE CRASS BROTHERS YESTERDAY.

1292
01:29:20,284 --> 01:29:21,351
THEY WERE TRYING TO ROB

1293
01:29:21,352 --> 01:29:22,887
A CONVENIENCE STORE
OR SOMETHING.

1294
01:29:22,888 --> 01:29:25,656
BUT YOUR BROTHER
IS STILL AT LARGE.

1295
01:29:25,657 --> 01:29:26,924
- FINE.

1296
01:29:26,925 --> 01:29:29,660
MEANWHILE, WE ALL NEED
TO STAY CLOSE TO JANIS.

1297
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:31,028
- JANIS, DO YOU HEAR THAT?

1298
01:29:31,029 --> 01:29:34,798
YOU'VE GOT FRIENDS
THAT WILL STICK BY YOU.

1299
01:29:34,799 --> 01:29:37,668
- NO, THIS IS SOMETHING I DID.

1300
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:40,303
ME.

1301
01:29:40,304 --> 01:29:42,973
I NEED TO DISAPPEAR.

1302
01:29:42,974 --> 01:29:44,808
- JANIS, BE REASONABLE.

1303
01:29:44,809 --> 01:29:46,877
SOONER OR LATER,
AND PROBABLY SOONER,

1304
01:29:46,878 --> 01:29:48,779
ONE OF THESE MONSTERS
IS GONNA COME AND FIND YOU.

1305
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:51,448
- I SAID NO.

1306
01:29:51,449 --> 01:29:53,751
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT,
SO JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME,

1307
01:29:53,752 --> 01:29:54,885
ALL OF YOU.

1308
01:29:54,886 --> 01:29:57,421
- NO, JANIS, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA DO THIS.

1309
01:29:57,422 --> 01:30:01,525
EVIL ONLY WINS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE
DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

1310
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:04,127
- AND WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

1311
01:30:08,099 --> 01:30:14,605
- COME ON, WE'LL WALK YOU HOME.

1312
01:30:14,606 --> 01:30:17,641
- IT'S OKAY.

1313
01:30:17,642 --> 01:30:20,544
I HAVE MY BIG STRONG SOLDIER
TO PROTECT ME.

1314
01:30:25,817 --> 01:30:27,017
IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY.

1315
01:30:27,018 --> 01:30:29,286
THANKS.
- DON'T LEAVE HER SIDE.

1316
01:30:29,287 --> 01:30:30,287
- I WON'T.

1317
01:30:30,288 --> 01:30:31,956
- GET SOME REST.
- I WILL.

1318
01:30:36,294 --> 01:30:40,130
- YOU, COME HERE.
- HELLO.

- YOU'VE BEEN HIT.

1324
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:14,898
- WHOA.
[gunshot]

1325
01:31:14,899 --> 01:31:16,500
- YOU GOT A GUN?
- MY LEFT LEG.

1326
01:31:19,971 --> 01:31:21,872
- I LOVE YOU.

[slow gunshots]

1328
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:44,294
- WE MEET AGAIN.

1329
01:31:44,295 --> 01:31:48,666
DROP THE GUN.

1330
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:51,535
TOO BAD THIS HAS TO END.

1331
01:31:51,536 --> 01:31:55,472
WHEN WE WERE OUT
AT THE BIG CAT HABITAT,

1332
01:31:55,473 --> 01:31:59,209
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEGINNING
TO LIKE ME.

1333
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:01,979
- I LIKED YOU BETTER
WHEN YOU WERE DEAD IN KUWAIT.

1334
01:32:08,352 --> 01:32:11,588
- WELL, MY FAMILY YOU KILLED.

1335

[gunshot]

1336
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:20,363
[gunshots]

1337
01:32:26,871 --> 01:32:29,539
- SISTER DEAR.

1338
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:33,310
I HEAR YOU'RE AN EXPERT
AT MARTIAL ARTS.

1339
01:32:35,747 --> 01:32:40,084
LET'S JUST SEE HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

1340
01:32:40,085 --> 01:32:42,252
[guns clattering]

1341
01:32:47,592 --> 01:32:49,026
- HUH!

1342
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:50,961
UH!

1343
01:32:53,297 --> 01:32:56,700
UGH!

1344
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:58,235
HA!

1345
01:32:58,236 --> 01:32:59,669
- UH--
- AH!

1346
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:03,273
- [screaming]

1347
01:33:09,948 --> 01:33:12,482
- IT'S ALL OVER, LOVERBOY.

1348
01:33:12,483 --> 01:33:14,551
- DON'T HURT HIM, JAMEY.

1349
01:33:16,788 --> 01:33:18,421
- YOU WOULDN'T SHOOT
YOUR BROTHER.

1350
01:33:26,064 --> 01:33:28,999
[gunshot]

1351
01:33:36,908 --> 01:33:38,942
- ARE YOU OKAY?

1352
01:33:38,943 --> 01:33:42,545
- YOU GUYS OKAY?
- YEAH.

1353
01:33:42,546 --> 01:33:47,751
- JANIS, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?

1354
01:33:47,752 --> 01:33:49,787
- CLOSURE.
