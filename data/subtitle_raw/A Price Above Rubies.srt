1
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:18,065
A hundred years ago
in a shelter near Pinsk...

2
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,004
a young girl ran off into the woods.

3
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:24,975
Her father wanted her to marry a scholar
from the Pinsker yeshiva...

4
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:29,515
but for some reason,
maybe she was a little crazy, who knows?

5
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:32,608
She didn't want to.
Anyhow, she ran away.

6
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,950
- She ran away from home?
- Yeah.

7
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,387
It was in the middle of winter.

8
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:40,823
She wandered into the forest.

9
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:43,794
At first, no one at home
even knew she ran away.

10
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:46,923
They thought she got lost
in the snow somewhere and died.

11
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:50,867
They looked and looked for her,
but they never found her body.

12
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,336
They decided the wolves
ate her up.

13
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:59,373
Shh, Yossi, they'll hear us.

14
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,108
Yossi, they'll kill us
if they find you here.

15
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:07,744
No, they'll just kill me. I'm your
older brother so it falls on me.

16
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:10,755
I'm the only one around here
gettin' killed.

17
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:13,655
But, Yossi,
I love you more than anything.

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,820
More than Papa or lmma.
More than anything.

19
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,194
- More than God?
- A million times more.

20
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,065
You're a sinner! You're supposed to
love God above everything.

21
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,228
And after that,
your father and mother.

22
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:28,432
The Torah doesn't even say anything
about brothers and sisters.

23
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,170
- Then we'll add it in.
- You can't add anything
to the Torah, dunce!

24
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,076
Is finished.
Is the Word of God and thas that.

25
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:38,048
Not even the greatest scholar
can change a letter of it.

26
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:41,086
Then we'll write
our own Torah.

27
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,454
It was the longest, hardest winter
anyone could remember.

28
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:51,496
They sat shiva in Pinsk
for the girl who had disappeared.

29
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,035
And everyone went on
with their business until one day...

30
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,832
just as suddenly as she had disappeared,
the girl came back into town.

31
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,500
She was also, you know,
carrying a baby in her stomach.

32
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,441
She was pregnant.

33
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:07,911
In Pinsk, they said,
she got lost in the snow...

34
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:12,314
and was saved by a demon
who made her his wife.

35
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:15,979
That spring the woman had a baby,
a baby girl.

36
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:19,217
- They called her Yitta.
- Baba Yitta?

37
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:23,318
Thas right. Our whole
family's descended from Baba Yitta.

38
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:26,956
If you don't watch out,
you're gonna end up just like her.

39
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,533
Like how?

40
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:33,095
When she was real old and finally died,
Baba Yitta went up to heaven.

41
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:36,972
But God didn't want her,
so He sent her down to hell.

42
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:41,172
But when she got there,
Satan recognized her as his niece.

43
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,079
He couldn't bring himself
to make her suffer in hell...

44
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,981
so he sent her back
up here to our world...

45
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:51,819
where she wanders the earth like Cain,
alone forever.

46
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:54,119
Poor Baba Yitta.

47
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:57,719
Don't cry.
Remember what day it is?

48
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:07,168
Happy birthday.

49
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,978
A ruby!

50
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:19,751
I bought it from Papa's shop
with my savings.

51
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,990
Is fake!

52
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:30,188
Is the fake one Papa took out of
that ring. He was gonna throw it away.

53
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:42,770
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm going out to the lake.

54
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,241
But, Yossi,
you're not supposed to.

55
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,245
Imma says with your asthma
you could choke up and...

56
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:50,475
I'm the only boy around here
who can't swim.

57
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,245
I've been watching everybody else,
and I know what to do.

58
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,253
No one's even gonna be there
to see you swim.

59
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:59,052
They won't know you did it anyway,
so whas the point?

60
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,832
You'll know.

61
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:13,972
Yossi!

62
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:19,507
Yossi!

63
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:24,975
Yossi!

64
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,609
Good job.

65
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,656
Okay, very good. Thas it. Come on.

66
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,926
Wonderful job, dear.

67
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,931
We'll take care of him.

68
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:43,126
You have a beautiful baby.

69
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:48,672
You were calling out
the name "Yossi," Mrs. Horowitz.

70
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,903
Is that the name
you'd like to give your son?

71
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:01,382
Sonia, ill be all right.

72
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,547
Sonia, where are you going?

73
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:30,112
Easy, Sonia. You're turning my only
grandchild into a tube of toothpaste.

74
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:34,380
He's like a sacrifice.
They're gonna sacrifice my baby.

75
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:38,583
If your father, olov hasholem,
wasn't already in his grave...

76
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:42,218
you would put him in it with
the spectacle you're making of yourself.

77
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:44,353
Shimmie's gonna be just fine.
Look at those men.

78
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:47,831
Every one of them had the same
thing, and they're perfectly normal.

79
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:50,494
Well, not my baby, not today.

80
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:55,540
Hey, hey,
where are you going?

81
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,667
My brother told me he married a smart
girl, he married a pretty girl...

82
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:01,747
but he never told me
he married such a chicken.

83
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:05,249
Be proud, Sonia. This is the moment
your son becomes a Jew.

84
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,122
- Bring up the boy, please.
- No, wait.

85
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:14,057
Is okay? You checked?
Is sharp, no nicks or anything?

86
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,151
- You checked?
- Trust me.

87
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:19,163
Okay, double check. Check again
to make sure everything's okay.

88
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:21,256
Oh, is hot.
Is like an oven in here.

89
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,268
I don't want my son
cooking in this oven.
Can somebody open a window, please?

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,771
You've been coming to this shul
for 23 years. When was the last
time you saw an open window?

91
00:07:27,874 --> 00:07:31,105
- What kind of building for people
doesn't have an open window?
- When was the last time?

92
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:38,882
Sonia, come on.

93
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:40,885
Come on.

94
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:46,516
Shh.

95
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:49,891
Don't you drop him.

96
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,962
Careful.

97
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,268
Don't any one of you
dare drop him.

98
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,011
Nice girl you married.

99
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,210
How about the doors?
Maybe somebody could open the door.

100
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,777
Maybe we could get a draft.
Baruch, maybe you could get us a draft.

101
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,451
- A draft of what?
- Air, Baruch! So my son
doesn't choke to death in this.

102
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:24,553
I'm looking forward
to knowing her better now that
we're going to be neighbors.

103
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:35,806
I talked to Reb Fedder. You got the job
teaching at the yeshiva in Boro Park.

104
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:39,105
I already found you an apartment on 45th
Street. Is a stone's throw from by me.

105
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:42,044
And the Rebbe?
I'm going to be close to the Rebbe?

106
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:45,481
Three blocks from the Rebbe's house.
Thas where you're gonna be.

107
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:48,713
You'll pray with the Rebbe, you'll hear
the Rebbe's fabrengen every shabbes.

108
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:52,450
- You'll be up to your ears
with the Rebbe.
- I, I don't know what to say.

109
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:56,654
Only that Sender Horowitz
always looks out for his family...

110
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:59,822
especially his favorite
kid brother.

111
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:10,299
Mendel.

112
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,554
Is easier if you don't watch.

113
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:33,154
If they can do it,
I can watch it.

114
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:39,100
Amen.

115
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,884
Is fantastic!

116
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:03,791
So many different kinds of people.

117
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:07,059
- Fantastic and not so fantastic.
- Why not fantastic?

118
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,499
- Lots of people, lots of influences.
- They could be good influences.

119
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:13,401
Sometimes good,
sometimes not so good.

120
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:19,777
Go around, nu.

121
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,315
- There's no room for a car to pass.
- There's plenty of room for a car.

122
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,908
Unfortunately we're not in a car.
We're in this ridiculous boat.

123
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,921
- Is a station wagon.
- Whoever heard of a station wagon
for three people?

124
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:34,390
- You could fit a family
of 12 in this thing.
- God willing.

125
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:45,893
Sonia, I know you're still mad at me
because I named Shimmie after the Rebbe.

126
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,939
But he's our first son...

127
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,501
and I feel he should be invested with
the highest level of spirituality.

128
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,740
We can name our next boy Yossi.

129
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:58,874
Hmm?

130
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,457
The Rebbe.

131
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,934
A few pennies, young rebbe.
A little change for a woman...

132
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:18,299
who's been too long
on her tired feet.

133
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:21,168
- But my wife has all our money.
- Is been such a long time.

134
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,400
Four years.

135
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:25,670
Such a long time.

136
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,680
A thousand blessings
on your house.

137
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,279
Don't worry, bubbie,
it won't bite.

138
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:40,683
Bless you.

139
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,329
For what?

140
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:50,534
Is the Rebbe.

141
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:00,542
And so God picked that
humble, little mountain...

142
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:02,978
on which to present
His greatest gift.

143
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:07,178
The gift of His Torah.

144
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:10,687
But the question still remained:
To who was He going to give such a gift?

145
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,987
So God set out on a journey
to find which amongst
the nations of the earth...

146
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,653
was worthy of receiving His Torah.

147
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:20,289
God went to the Goyim in Canaan
and he asked them...

148
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,924
"Look what I have for you.

149
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,731
Is the Torah.

150
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,567
- Do you want my Torah?"
- No!

151
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:30,437
No, of course not.
No, no, not this.

152
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:36,379
Maybe something lighter like
this sweet floral pattern here,
or this nice blue chiffon look.

153
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,677
Personally, I'd recommend
something light and airy...

154
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,275
to complement the charming atmosphere
of your home.

155
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:44,185
Charming means "small," right?

156
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,885
I assume you'll be hanging
curtains in the living room
as well as in the kitchen...

157
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:50,325
which opens up
a whole range of choices.

158
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,989
For instance, you could decide
on an atmosphere of integration...

159
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,225
and unify the space
with a single theme...

160
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,996
or you could separate
the rooms visually.

161
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:01,231
Different looks, different atmospheres,
different states of mind.

162
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,501
America!

163
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:06,703
Yes, God came to America.

164
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:10,612
And also he asked the American Goyim,
"Do you want my Torah?"

165
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:14,208
And also they asked,
"Tell us what is in it first."

166
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,689
"Honor thy father and thy mother."

167
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:22,056
"Nah! Respect our parents?
I don't think so.

168
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:26,120
Get that thing. What do you call it?
Torah? Get it out of here?"

169
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,395
So, God came...

170
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:34,404
to Israel.

171
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:37,407
"Israel," He asked us...

172
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,741
"Jews, do you want my Torah?"

173
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:44,315
And what did they answer?

174
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,385
"Naaseh ve nishmah!"

175
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:51,946
Quiet down. You're wrecking
your auns new apartment
before she's moved into it.

176
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:55,220
In one case,
the apartment is a whole, unified.

177
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,457
In the other, the living room is the
living room, the kitchen is the kitchen.

178
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:02,090
You're cooking all day.
You're exhausted.

179
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:05,728
You walk out of the kitchen and presto,
is like you're in another world.

180
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:08,864
One of us here is completely insane
and I think is you.

181
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,033
But you're gonna have company real soon
if I have to listen...

182
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,077
to one more word of this meshugas.

183
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:16,636
- Aunt Sonia, I think the baby's hungry.
- Come here, sweetheart.

184
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,943
Shh, shh.

185
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:35,723
Shh, shh.

186
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,933
Shh, shh.

187
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,636
Listen to me.
Sit down!

188
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:56,113
Are you all right?
I know it can hurt sometimes.

189
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:58,485
It doesn't hurt.

190
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,549
Here. Is too, um...

191
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,135
Mendel?

192
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:31,582
Didn't you pray already?

193
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,961
I wasn't praying.

194
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,695
I was learning a little Mishnah.

195
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:55,001
- Anything good?
- Yes, is all good.

196
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:03,573
- Can't we leave it on? Just for a while?
- Sonia.

197
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:08,279
Enough, Sonia.

198
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,746
Enough!

199
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:16,681
Sonia, enough!

200
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:22,691
- Enough what?
- Just enough.

201
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:26,286
- Is indecent.
- Making love to your wife is indecent?

202
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,731
Making love to your wife
like that is.

203
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,769
We're not alone, Sonia.

204
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,065
We're under the eyes of God.

205
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:36,937
The Talmud teaches a man to love
his wife, and I try. God knows I try.

206
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:41,445
But for a man is supposed
to be different. Is supposed
to be a mitzvah, a holy act.

207
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:44,277
And I'm supposed to think exalted
thoughts in order to sanctify it.

208
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:47,546
And I'm supposed to enjoy this,
I'm supposed to enjoy myself knowing...

209
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:51,612
you're up there thinking about Abraham
and Isaac and the Rebbe while...

210
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:55,921
God forbid! God forbid you talk
that way about the Rebbe!

211
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:22,045
Sonia, I'm sorry.

212
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:25,282
I'm sorry I raised my voice to you.

213
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:32,629
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,186
Can I play a little?

215
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:59,951
Of course.
A little's okay.

216
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:24,043
Amen.

217
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:27,949
You don't have to eat it. Just put it
in your mouth and chew a little.

218
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:31,022
- He's not hungry.
- Are you his mother? No.

219
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:33,819
So how do you know
he's not hungry?

220
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:36,655
So God spared the Moabites.
The reason being...

221
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:38,662
- Mendel.
- That Ruth's family
was living among them.

222
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:41,392
Wait. He's giving a dvar Torah.
Is nice. Please listen.

223
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,231
- Is just a story.
- Is still a dvar Torah.

224
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:49,797
Why didn't God allow Ruth's
family to survive an attack?
He coulïve done that.

225
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:52,342
The answer to the question is
of course God coulïve done it.

226
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:55,140
But a young girl needs a mother.
And a mother needs a husband.

227
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:59,013
- And a family needs a house.
- What else?
Maybe a VCR and a video recorder?

228
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:01,517
And they need someone
to make their clothes.

229
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,713
Why don't you shush everyone up
so your son can finish?

230
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:07,314
- He's a man. He can make himself heard.
- But nobody's listening.

231
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:09,587
- He won't eat.
- Who are you to tell me what to do?

232
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:11,890
- He's not gonna eat.
- Obviously you're
a better mother than I am.

233
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:16,331
It shows us how family is
so important, even the evil
Moabites were spared by God...

234
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,665
because they were needed
in order to bring up Ruth.

235
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,237
- Yasher.
- Yasher coach.

236
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,000
Yasher coach.

237
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:24,940
Keep it up and you'll be a great scholar
like your Uncle Mendel.

238
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:27,534
Please, I'm not so great just yet.

239
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,580
Modesty is becoming
unless is false.

240
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:33,549
All I hear at the yeshiva these days is
"Mendel said this, Mendel said that."

241
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:35,677
Like the Rambam came
to learn by them.

242
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:39,018
While we're on the subject
of the yeshiva...

243
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:41,092
the other day a young boy,
one of my students...

244
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,821
asked me a question
I couldn't really answer.

245
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:48,593
His father says is okay to steal
as long as you steal from Goyim.

246
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,727
His teacher tells him
stealing from anyone is a sin.

247
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:54,999
So if he agrees with his teacher,
he's disrespecting his father.

248
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,302
But if he agrees with his father,
he's honoring a thief...

249
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,003
and in danger
of becoming one himself.

250
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:03,548
- Is a tough question.
Only because you're a scholar.

251
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:14,251
If is just an opinion and the boy
disagrees with it, thas all right.

252
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,157
You can respect those
you disagree with.

253
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:19,787
But if his father
really is a thief...

254
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:22,560
then the boy should keep
his nose in his own business...

255
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,465
so he doesn't have to judge
what he doesn't know about.

256
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:49,986
Hey, those little fingers
are gonna get chopped off...

257
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:52,256
if they wander
where they don't belong.

258
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:55,299
Tsipi, please take care
of your brother.

259
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:01,034
- Here.
- Oh, please, Sonia,
tonight you don't need to work.

260
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:05,576
- You should be inside
with Mendel and the baby.
- No, is okay, is okay.

261
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,305
Is such a wonderful meal.
I have to do something.

262
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:10,108
And you have such a beautiful home.
Thank you.

263
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:14,208
Baruch haShem. The kids are healthy,
they have what to eat.

264
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,514
Thas whas important.

265
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,521
Here.

266
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,295
Do you have a second?

267
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:45,413
Relax.

268
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:48,350
Is not for you.
I just want your opinion.

269
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:59,494
My principal buyer
came across it.

270
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:04,058
Is an antique brooch from Paris,
circa 1880, from Querelle.

271
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,797
Thas an eight-carat emerald
set in gold.

272
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:10,966
My wife's birthday is coming up,
so I thought I'd surprise her.

273
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:15,877
- Is beautiful!
- Five thousand bucks!
What a bargain, huh?

274
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:19,015
Yeah.

275
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:22,348
- You did great.
- Bullshit.

276
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:25,355
I understand your father,
may his memory be a blessing...

277
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:28,051
was the finest gemologist
in the state.

278
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,027
I also understand you picked up
a thing or two from him.

279
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,841
Querelle never designed
a base like this.

280
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:48,344
I can't tell you what the date on it is,
but it is not 1880.

281
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,347
I also think if you check on this stone,
you'll find is just a composite...

282
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:56,580
a layer of emerald fused with
glass and then backed by foil
to give it all that brilliance.

283
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:58,588
Is excellent work.

284
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,353
But I wouldn't price it
at a dime over 800 bucks.

285
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,224
Why didn't you go
into the business?

286
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,630
Because my parents didn't want me
mixing with unsavory characters.

287
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:15,400
They wanted me to marry
a great scholar, and live
a decent, spiritual Jewish life.

288
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:17,407
Did you?

289
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:22,940
Did you marry a great scholar?

290
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:27,715
Well, that I'm not qualified
to answer.

291
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,912
But I know I married a tzaddik.

292
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:34,424
A holy man? Don't you think our Mendel's
a little young for such distinction?

293
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:37,552
Age has nothing
to do with it.

294
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:40,426
Either you're born with the heart
of a tzaddik or you're not.

295
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:42,625
And your heart?

296
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,995
Is it in your heart to be
the wife of a tzaddik?

297
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:52,339
All right, dessers on the table.

298
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:07,558
Sonia.

299
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:09,593
Sonia?

300
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,391
Gottenyu!
You're red as a beet.

301
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:16,797
And hot like an oven.
You're burning with fever, poor thing.

302
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,495
Why didn't you say something?

303
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,999
Sit, sit on the bed.

304
00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:28,909
You're having a panic attack.

305
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:32,006
Breathe.
Slowly breathe.

306
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:35,780
Your muscles are like iron knots.

307
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,549
Just relax and breathe.

308
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:40,557
Good.

309
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:43,856
It must be overwhelming for you.

310
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:48,296
A new city, a new family,
all these new pressures.

311
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,196
You're just wound up too tight.

312
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,636
Just relax and breathe.

313
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:59,301
Relax.

314
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,902
I know it can be hard sometimes.

315
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:05,380
Is a new neighborhood,
new people.

316
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:07,383
You'll be all right.

317
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:11,353
You just need to breathe.
Just relax and breathe.

318
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:21,197
Sonia, my God!

319
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:28,031
Whas gotten into you?
You need help.

320
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:33,969
The Rebbe will see you now.

321
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,578
You know, some of these others
have been waiting longer.
Maybe another day might be...

322
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,353
Sonia, don't make a scene, please.
Okay?

323
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,362
Go on.

324
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:04,274
Come on in, Mrs. Horowitz.

325
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:15,815
Take a seat.

326
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:23,783
I understand your husband
is a truly inspired teacher...

327
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:26,591
as well as a great scholar.

328
00:28:26,698 --> 00:28:31,260
Filling the hearts of our children
with a love of Torah...

329
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:35,965
is the greatest mitzvah of all
in Goïs eyes.

330
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:42,572
He's making you nervous?

331
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:46,779
Get my wife right away.

332
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,156
I understand you're troubled.

333
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,640
I don't know what to say.

334
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:13,006
I can't find the words.

335
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:17,306
The Almighty gave you
a soul to nurture.

336
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:20,873
He gave you a body
in which to house it.

337
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:25,684
He gave you a mind in order
to understand your soul's needs.

338
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,193
And He gave you a tongue
in order to express them.

339
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:37,296
If the desire to hear your soul
is strong enough...

340
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,427
you'll find the words.

341
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:46,769
I don't even know where my body ends
and my soul begins.

342
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:52,839
I felt, ever since
I was a very young girl...

343
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:58,150
like there was a fire...

344
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:02,124
inside of me.

345
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:05,856
It used to be nice.
It kept me warm.

346
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:11,559
But is been getting hotter.

347
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:16,205
It...

348
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,642
It makes my stomach burn...

349
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:24,772
and my nerves and my skin.

350
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:28,080
I can hardly put on a shirt.

351
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:33,815
I can't even breast feed my child.

352
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:36,223
Is too hot!

353
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:39,091
Everything is too hot.

354
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,593
Every touch burns me.

355
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:49,499
I have no soul.

356
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:53,008
The Almighty gave every one
of us a soul!

357
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:58,845
Whatever torment you are suffering,
you must always remember that.

358
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,918
You have a soul!

359
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:06,321
Maybe. But if I do,
it wasn't God who gave it to me.

360
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:16,556
"In defiance of Biblical prophesy...

361
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,364
and the holy redemption
of the Jewish people...

362
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,701
through Goïs grace alone,
Boro Park's Rebbe Moishe Myerson...

363
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:26,368
has demonstrated that he is little more
than a gentile heretic...

364
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:28,502
in the guise of a Jew."

365
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,173
Who do these people think they are?

366
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:33,807
They've gone too far this time,
these fanatics.

367
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:39,049
Rebbe, please tell
us you won't let this attack go
without a stinging rebuttal.

368
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:41,648
Rebbe?

369
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,624
If you prefer,
we can compose a letter.

370
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:52,499
- Tomorrow.
- But, Rebbe, if we wait
till tomorrow, this article...

371
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,867
I said tomorrow!

372
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,017
Guess who!

373
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:21,092
Have you gone crazy?
You could give a person a heart attack.

374
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:23,565
Ah.
Something smells good!

375
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:27,536
- Is the cholent.
I'm making it special for...
- No, no, is not that.

376
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:36,870
Is you that smells so good.

377
00:32:36,981 --> 00:32:38,949
God forgive me.

378
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,453
But I think is 20 years
since I told you how beautiful you look.

379
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:47,786
Is been 20 years
since I looked beautiful.

380
00:32:47,892 --> 00:32:52,158
Moishe! You've heard
too many evil stories today.

381
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:55,562
Sometimes is the exposure to evil
that brings out our best side.

382
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:58,191
Look, you shouldn't get
so excited.

383
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:00,361
The doctor says you can't
allow yourself to get...

384
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:04,874
Oh, what doctor?
What do doctors know about love?

385
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:25,855
When the Rebbe's heart
stopped beating last night...

386
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,659
we lost more than just a man.

387
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:36,196
For his was a heart that beat not only
to maintain the life of one man...

388
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:41,768
it beat to maintain
the vital circulation
of the entire nation of Israel.

389
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:45,277
And who can even begin
to understand...

390
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:50,548
what force could be strong enough
to still such a heart?

391
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,123
What kind of a terrible power...

392
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:56,682
could have caused such a tragedy?

393
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:59,592
When the Rebbe's heart
stopped beating last night...

394
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:02,188
we lost our own Moishe Rebbenu...

395
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,135
who led us from the depths of the
holocaust and reinvigorated an entire...

396
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,864
Sonia, what did she say?

397
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:37,059
Sonia?

398
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,077
Shh.

399
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:00,817
Shh. I know.

400
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:03,792
Oh. Shh.

401
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,694
Shh.

402
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:38,351
Why are you hiding?

403
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:45,434
There's nobody here but you.

404
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,663
Who are you hiding from?

405
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:10,226
Are you cold?

406
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:13,329
Mendel isn't home.

407
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:17,663
I know.
Can I come in?

408
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:41,417
Actually it was you I came for.

409
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:47,128
I want to offer you a job.

410
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:54,764
Your analysis of the brooch I showed you
last shabbes was right on the money.

411
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:02,304
I want you to run my store
here in Boro Park.

412
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,575
I thought you worked in Manhattan.

413
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:10,347
I didn't know you had a store
here in the neighborhood.

414
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:12,786
Thas because I don't.

415
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,257
At least not officially.

416
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,158
Is a basement a few blocks away.

417
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:23,927
From there, I see a select variety
of jewelry, only the very finest pieces.

418
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:29,166
My buyer Heschel has impeccable taste,
but he's getting old.

419
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:31,366
I want you to take over for him.

420
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:35,336
Hmm? Go into the city
three days a week...

421
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:39,382
and pick out only the best pieces
you come across.

422
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:44,182
There should be no more than 30 or 40
pieces in the store at any given time.

423
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:46,518
Three days a week,
you stay in the store to sell...

424
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,592
but the other three
you'll be in the city...

425
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:52,094
on 47th street, all over.

426
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:56,257
Sometimes even out of state
for a few days on a special buy.

427
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,063
What do you say?

428
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:03,837
Ah, oh, well...

429
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:06,239
Well, I'm a mother now.

430
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:11,441
Half the mothers in Boro Park
are running cash businesses
out of their own basements.

431
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:15,212
The days that you're in
the city, you can leave Shimmie
by my wife or by Rachel.

432
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:19,346
- The other days you keep him
with you in the store.
- Oh, what does Mendel say?

433
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,857
Does it matter?

434
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:27,421
Does he even know about it?

435
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:30,091
I thought I'd let you tell him.

436
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:38,734
A cash business means no taxes paid,
and no taxes paid means theft.

437
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:41,243
Even if it is from
the government, is a sin.

438
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:43,939
Once when I was a boy...

439
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:48,508
I stole the answers to a test
from my teacher's drawer.

440
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,849
I copied them and put them back
before he noticed.

441
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:54,413
I got 100 on the test,
and I felt terrific.

442
00:38:56,327 --> 00:39:00,593
I was dancing for a week
like Gene Kelly.

443
00:39:00,698 --> 00:39:03,394
I knew then that my conscience
would be useless to me.

444
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:08,962
So, without telling him why, I asked
my father to teach me how to avoid sin.

445
00:39:09,073 --> 00:39:10,973
He told me about his teacher...

446
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:14,977
a tzaddik who kept a notebook
in which he recorded all his sins...

447
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,038
from the day of his bar mitzvah onward.

448
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,448
One day when he was 93 years old...

449
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:25,283
the tzaddik forgot his notebook
on his desk at the yeshiva.

450
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:28,847
Just one notebook.
Most people would have a library full.

451
00:39:30,694 --> 00:39:34,653
My father and some of
the other boys ran over...

452
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:37,893
to see what sins
the great rebbe had committed.

453
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:46,073
But when they opened the notebook,
they couldn't believe their eyes.

454
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:49,613
The first page had not yet even been
completely filled up.

455
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:53,882
If we all wrote down our sins,
my father said...

456
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:56,782
we'd be more careful
about committing them.

457
00:39:56,887 --> 00:40:00,482
We sin because we're careless
and we don't think about it.

458
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:09,529
My father was an idiot.

459
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:15,933
The tzaddik kept his book of sins
for his students to discover.

460
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,672
But his other sins
he kept in his heart...

461
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:24,577
for they were dearer to him
even than was God...

462
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:27,412
and he couldn't bear
to part with them.

463
00:40:30,654 --> 00:40:34,886
Piety is the standard
by which we are judged.

464
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:38,689
But is the quality of our sins
which sets us apart.

465
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:42,052
You'll start on Monday.

466
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:22,698
Good morning, Mr. Kapoor. I'm Sonia
Horowitz, Sender Horowitz's new buyer.

467
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,633
Good morning, Miss Horowitz.
But I'm not...

468
00:42:25,736 --> 00:42:30,400
Actually is Mrs. Horowitz. And there's
something I'd like to show you.

469
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,374
You recognize this?
No?

470
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:37,106
You can't remember an antique
brooch designed by Querelle
worth 30,000 bucks...

471
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:41,708
which you parted with for only
five, but is really worth
nothing because is a fake?

472
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:44,982
- Is that what you can't remember?
- I can hardly remember my name...

473
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:49,423
- Ramon.
- This is Mr. Kapoor. I just work here.

474
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:53,219
I'm Hrundi Kapoor.

475
00:42:54,798 --> 00:42:57,096
I've never seen
that piece before.

476
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:03,466
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Mr. Kapoor.

477
00:43:03,574 --> 00:43:06,042
Mr. Horowitz's previous buyer
may have been too old...

478
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:09,772
or just too trusting to detect
this fake, but he can remember
where he bought it from.

479
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,848
As I said,
I've never seen that piece before.

480
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:14,315
We have one of two
possibilities here, Mr. Kapoor.

481
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:17,353
One, you yourself didn't know it was
a fake and unwittingly passed it on.

482
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:20,423
Two, you knew. Either way,
you're doing dishonorable business.

483
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:22,992
And as I understand it,
if Mr. Horowitz so desired...

484
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:25,789
he could tarnish your reputation
so thoroughly that within a week...

485
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:29,923
you would be out on the street corner
hawking watches out of a suitcase.

486
00:43:30,034 --> 00:43:35,472
Normally, Mr. Horowitz would have come
down here and told you all this himself.

487
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:38,336
But I think he was a little concerned
with losing his temper.

488
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:41,605
So here I am. And although I happen
to have a temper myself...

489
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:45,204
I have no particular
emotional investment in
this unfortunate transaction.

490
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:48,614
So it might be possible for you and I
to start on a fresh page...

491
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,678
and embark on a relationship
that would better profit
both yourself and Mr. Horowitz.

492
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:57,193
The emphasis, of course,
being on Mr. Horowitz. What do you say?

493
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:10,465
- What can I say?
- How about...

494
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:13,600
"Good morning, Mrs. Horowitz.
Welcome to 47th Street.

495
00:44:13,711 --> 00:44:16,373
From now on, I'll be selling
to you at 80°/ below retail.

496
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,971
Is there anything
I can interest you in today?"

497
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:26,916
Good morning, Mrs. Horowitz.
Welcome to 47th Street.

498
00:44:27,024 --> 00:44:30,983
Mr. And Mrs. Mizrachi,
Mrs. Horowitz is my new buyer.

499
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:32,722
- Hello.
- Hello.

500
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,923
I'm sure Heschel will be missed.

501
00:44:35,032 --> 00:44:39,799
But whatever she lacks in experience,
she'll make up for with a superb taste.

502
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:41,928
Thas nice.
Any relations?

503
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:45,338
- Excuse me?
- She's my sister-in-law.

504
00:44:45,442 --> 00:44:48,741
I'm keeping things in the family so she
can put my brother through yeshiva.

505
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:52,247
You like them, Mrs. Gelbart?

506
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:56,376
What I'd really like is for my husband,
God bless him...

507
00:44:56,487 --> 00:45:00,184
to get off his fat ass,
surprise me with something...

508
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,554
instead of handing me
a wad of cash...

509
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:05,992
and telling me,
"Go make yourself happy."

510
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:09,031
I understand, Mrs. Gelbart.

511
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:12,500
But the joy of the surprise
lasts only a few moments...

512
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:15,538
and then you're at the mercy
of his taste.

513
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,607
At least this way you can choose
something for yourself...

514
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:19,676
that will give you naches
for the rest of your life.

515
00:45:19,777 --> 00:45:22,541
You've got excellent taste,
Mr. Sugarman.

516
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:25,046
That ring was designed
by Eddie Sakamoto.

517
00:45:25,149 --> 00:45:29,210
A beautiful combination of cobachon
and diamonds laid in a platinum band.

518
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:32,948
That design won first prize
in the Spectrum competition last fall.

519
00:45:33,056 --> 00:45:36,617
So, uh, what range
are we talking about here?

520
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:40,356
Mr. Sugarman, I'm not going to pretend
to give you some kind of fancy bargain.

521
00:45:40,464 --> 00:45:42,364
I'll sell it to you
for what is worth.

522
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:06,182
Is so nice to see
a new face here.

523
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:10,087
Is very inspirational.

524
00:46:10,194 --> 00:46:15,689
It just makes me want to...
buy something.

525
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:18,529
Well, since is your wife's birthday,
Mr. Fishbein...

526
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:20,830
I recommend this bracelet.

527
00:46:20,938 --> 00:46:24,840
Is silver inlaid with ruby.
Is her birthstone, and mine.

528
00:46:24,942 --> 00:46:27,604
Could you model it for me?

529
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:37,987
Ahh.
That looks fabulous.

530
00:46:39,323 --> 00:46:43,453
But such a lovely wrist,
I imagine anything would.

531
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,188
The question is, Mr. Fishbein...

532
00:46:46,296 --> 00:46:50,756
whether you think your wife,
Mrs. Fishbein, will like it.

533
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:54,470
The question is, Mrs. Horowitz...

534
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:59,941
why a woman as lovely as you...

535
00:47:00,043 --> 00:47:02,477
is not wearing any jewelry of her own.

536
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:23,765
Well?

537
00:47:27,604 --> 00:47:29,504
Mmm, is good.

538
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:31,938
But what?

539
00:47:34,578 --> 00:47:37,240
- But nothing. Is good.
I didn't say "but."
- But you thought it.

540
00:47:37,347 --> 00:47:40,316
I could see it there over your head
like a little gray cloud.

541
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:43,318
A little "but" something.
But what?

542
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,447
I understand most of the nutrients that
can be found in freshly-cooked foods...

543
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:49,923
are absent in microwaveable products.

544
00:47:50,027 --> 00:47:53,053
Sounds like you've
been reading articles...

545
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:56,496
on a rather wide variety
of subjects.

546
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,296
Or else you've been getting an earful
from your sister Rachel.

547
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:03,362
In which case, I'd thank her
to keep her nose out of my affairs.

548
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:11,839
Do you know what
today is, Mendel?

549
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:13,883
No, I don't.

550
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:15,884
Is my birthday.

551
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:25,427
Sonia.

552
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:32,035
Sonia...

553
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:34,695
I know that you're working now.

554
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:37,933
And I know that you like it,
so I'm glad for you.

555
00:48:39,676 --> 00:48:42,975
But you run out of the house at the
crack of dawn. I hardly ever see you.

556
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,813
And when I do is to get
a microwave dinner tossed at me
like I'm some charity case.

557
00:48:49,152 --> 00:48:51,279
I know I spend my day
with my nose stuck in a book...

558
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:54,687
but I'm not a complete idiot
when it comes to these things.

559
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:57,316
Is clear that something's missing.
What is it?

560
00:48:57,427 --> 00:48:59,418
What is what?

561
00:48:59,529 --> 00:49:02,760
- What is it that you want?
- I don't know.

562
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:05,801
Mendel, if I knew...

563
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:13,339
Mendel, I just want
something beautiful.

564
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:17,038
Sonia, you have it right here.
You have a home, a child...

565
00:49:17,147 --> 00:49:20,082
and a husband who loves you
more than anything in the whole world.

566
00:49:20,183 --> 00:49:22,879
Yes, in this world, maybe.

567
00:49:22,986 --> 00:49:25,318
But what about
the other world?

568
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:27,720
The world of the spirit
and the Torah and the Talmud?

569
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:32,124
What about that world?
Do you love me more than that, Mendel?

570
00:49:34,364 --> 00:49:36,889
What about God?

571
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:42,601
Do you love me more than
you love God, Mendel?

572
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:47,333
Sonia, thas a terrible thing to ask.

573
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,424
I'm sorry, Mendel.

574
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:11,963
You're a good man.

575
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:15,004
And this life is good,
but is not beautiful.

576
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:18,632
But... goodness is beauty.

577
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:20,710
No!

578
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:24,770
Beauty has goodness in it,
but it can also be terrible.

579
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,111
Is that what you want?

580
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,518
That, that things
should be terrible?

581
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:37,952
Is that what
would make you happy?

582
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:12,460
Whoa, whoa. Is too early.
You come back in a half hour. Sorry.

583
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:23,267
Just for a moment.

584
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:34,278
"A woman of fortitude, who can find?

585
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:38,184
For her price is far above rubies.

586
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,920
When her husband relies on her,
he shall lack no fortune.

587
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:50,794
She rises in the morning
to feed her household.

588
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:54,803
Strength and majesty are her raiment...

589
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:59,308
and joyfully she can anticipate
the day of judgment.

590
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:05,473
False is grandeur
and vain is beauty.

591
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:10,212
Only a God-fearing woman
deserves praise.

592
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,550
Give her the fruits of her handiwork...

593
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:17,525
and let her be praised at the gates
of heaven for her countless deeds."

594
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:27,666
Sometimes I look at men
and wonder...

595
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:30,137
how could God have created...

596
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,007
so ugly a creature
for woman to cling to.

597
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,045
Men are ugly!

598
00:52:41,051 --> 00:52:42,985
But you...

599
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:47,188
Sender Horowitz...

600
00:52:49,392 --> 00:52:53,328
you are the ugliest man of all.

601
00:52:56,333 --> 00:53:00,167
Thas a flawless
brilliant cut stone from
South Africa. Top of the line.

602
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:04,902
Hmm. How's business, Mr. Kapoor?

603
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:12,409
Business? The rich are buying
at Tiffany's and Saks. The poor
are carjacking the rich ones...

604
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:16,679
and everybody else is sitting
on their couches watching
the Home Shopping Network.

605
00:53:16,786 --> 00:53:19,653
Not surprising if this is the kind
of merchandise you showcase.

606
00:53:19,756 --> 00:53:23,283
Listen here, Mrs. Horowitz,
I triple check everything I show you.

607
00:53:23,393 --> 00:53:26,521
Thas a perfectly sound diamond
in a perfectly sound ring.

608
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:31,090
Mm-hmm. Is perfectly sound.
And perfectly boring.

609
00:53:33,036 --> 00:53:36,437
Hey, back me up here.
Boring or not?

610
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,608
Boring.

611
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,043
Ramon, isn't today your...

612
00:53:44,147 --> 00:53:49,414
Half day? Yeah.
Today I'm outta here at... Right now.

613
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,420
I'm outta here now.
Thank you, Mr. Kapoor.

614
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:55,150
Is a classic, Mrs. Horowitz.

615
00:53:55,258 --> 00:53:58,489
And the point of a classic
is its steadfastness.

616
00:53:58,595 --> 00:54:02,361
There are some things
nobody wants to change.

617
00:54:02,465 --> 00:54:05,957
I was holding this one just for you,
but I'll be more than happy...

618
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:08,094
No, no, no, no.
I'll take it.

619
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:11,833
The sad fact is, is probably
the best piece I've seen all week.

620
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:14,535
Lucky for me,
is on an 80°/ discount rate.

621
00:54:14,644 --> 00:54:17,670
Good choice, Mrs. Horowitz.

622
00:54:21,685 --> 00:54:23,880
I like this one.

623
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,719
And since when are you an expert?

624
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:35,889
I didn't say I was an expert.
I just like this one.

625
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,427
That one?

626
00:54:42,205 --> 00:54:44,105
What is this?

627
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:47,836
Just some free-floating junk that came
in with a batch of useless gold items.

628
00:54:47,944 --> 00:54:50,970
I'll sell it
to the melters at cost.

629
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:55,177
- Where did you find this?
- Somewhere. Chinatown. I don't know.

630
00:55:00,657 --> 00:55:03,558
You look at this...

631
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,060
and call it a piece of junk
from Chinatown...

632
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:08,824
and you wonder why
your business is bad?

633
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:13,460
What? Did God put you on this earth
for the purpose of busting my chops?

634
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:16,903
If you like it, I'll throw it in
with the other one. All right?

635
00:55:17,006 --> 00:55:18,837
Okay.

636
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,913
- You like that piece?
- Yeah, I like it.

637
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:34,922
I'm asking you about it.
I like it.

638
00:55:35,024 --> 00:55:37,959
Then it came from my store.

639
00:55:38,061 --> 00:55:41,030
- Anything you like,
this is where it came from.
- Oh, no, no.

640
00:55:46,603 --> 00:55:49,128
If this piece is hot or something,
I've got nothing to do with it.

641
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:51,434
- You cops have got to stop hassling me.
- Cops?

642
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:54,135
Maybe the guy before me
had some kind of shady business.

643
00:55:54,244 --> 00:55:56,144
I'm clean as a whistle,
you understand me?

644
00:55:56,246 --> 00:55:58,146
I've got receipts.
You want to see? Everything.

645
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:05,776
Excuse me.

646
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:09,848
Could you... Excuse me.

647
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,584
You're going to hell.

648
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:44,183
For eating an egg roll?

649
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:46,558
For eating pig.

650
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:48,688
Mmm, is delicious!

651
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:53,633
- You're going to hell.
- Really?

652
00:56:54,938 --> 00:56:57,372
And yesterday...

653
00:56:57,474 --> 00:56:59,999
when I was lying on a desk getting
shtupped by my brother-in-law...

654
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:02,600
yesterday I wasn't going to hell?

655
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:08,617
I'm sorry.

656
00:57:09,953 --> 00:57:12,649
Yossi, I'm sorry.
I'll shut up, okay?

657
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:22,196
Little boys always hate any noise
they're not making themselves.

658
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:30,601
Something sweet with which to coat
the worlïs bitter pill, tataleh.

659
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:35,575
What are you doing
so far from home?

660
00:57:35,678 --> 00:57:38,078
I might ask you
the same question.

661
00:57:38,181 --> 00:57:42,550
Spare some change for a woman who's been
walking too long on her tired feet?

662
00:57:42,652 --> 00:57:44,620
I'm sorry.

663
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:52,056
Nice earrings.

664
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:59,626
Excuse me.
Those earrings are beautiful.

665
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:02,261
Thanks.

666
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:05,773
Do you mind if I take
a closer look?

667
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:14,716
Where did you get these?

668
00:58:14,817 --> 00:58:17,718
Listen, lady, I'm glad you like them,
but they're not valuable or nothing!

669
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,448
There's this guy who makes them
in my neighborhood.

670
00:58:20,557 --> 00:58:24,084
- Just some neighborhood guy
who makes nice stuff.
- What neighborhood?

671
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,480
Buenos dias.

672
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:50,177
Hello.
Um, I'm looking for a jeweler.

673
00:58:50,286 --> 00:58:54,245
I was given this address.
Jeweler?

674
00:58:54,357 --> 00:58:56,985
- Jewelry maker?
- Ah, si.

675
00:58:57,093 --> 00:58:59,823
Si. Entra, por favor.

676
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,067
Mi hijo.

677
00:59:12,175 --> 00:59:15,008
- My son.
- Oh!

678
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:17,705
Venga.

679
00:59:17,814 --> 00:59:20,681
Pase. Down.
Down the stairs.

680
00:59:27,323 --> 00:59:30,520
Those the ones that I wanted?

681
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:32,891
- Yeah, is the same ones.
- They don't look like it.

682
00:59:32,996 --> 00:59:36,454
- Is the ones. I'm telling you.
- They don't look like Charlene's.

683
00:59:36,566 --> 00:59:39,660
This is better.

684
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:41,669
Suits your face.

685
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:45,172
You getting picky now? You know mine
are sold. Yours can never be like this.

686
00:59:45,274 --> 00:59:49,370
Whatever, girl.
How much you want for it?

687
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:52,448
The reward is seeing it on such a
lovely ear. Thas all I could ask for.

688
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:54,448
Yo, Ramon.

689
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,145
I've been posin' my naked ass
over here for three weekends in a row.

690
00:59:58,254 --> 01:00:01,553
You ain't paid me jack,
and now you're turning down her dollars?

691
01:00:01,658 --> 01:00:06,095
Shut up. Thas 'cause your fat ass
ain't worth my dollars, homegirl.

692
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:08,095
The hell with this, all right?

693
01:00:08,197 --> 01:00:11,826
Come on. Whas up with acting
like this? All right?

694
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:14,300
Come on.
Whatcha doin'?

695
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,481
Here.

696
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:31,085
Take this for now.
Talk to her, all right?

697
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:34,088
- Is cold in here, man.
- I need you guys. I know.

698
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,158
One more time, all right?

699
01:00:39,562 --> 01:00:41,462
Let me guess.

700
01:00:41,564 --> 01:00:46,433
You didn't quite succeed at
getting my ass fired at work today...

701
01:00:46,536 --> 01:00:49,403
so you decided
to follow me home...

702
01:00:49,505 --> 01:00:52,406
and make sure my life
is a living hell here as well?

703
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:55,568
Not exactly.

704
01:00:55,678 --> 01:00:57,703
You're quite a collector.

705
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:04,814
You mean these?
Not exactly.

706
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:07,412
I mean, I make them.

707
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:10,458
Nobody buys any,
so I guess I'm collecting them.

708
01:01:14,897 --> 01:01:17,388
What about these?

709
01:01:19,335 --> 01:01:24,602
Is just stuff I sell
to the neighborhood girls
for some pocket money.

710
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:28,040
You know? Mostly metal shavings
from my sculptures.

711
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:31,477
- Is worthless.
- Worthless?

712
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:33,446
This is art.

713
01:01:35,618 --> 01:01:38,178
- Yo, Ray. Peace.
- Yo. Peace, Ty.

714
01:01:38,287 --> 01:01:41,450
- Later. All right?
- Yeah, all right.

715
01:01:41,557 --> 01:01:45,550
You have
an interesting style, Ramon.

716
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:50,064
Is not really no style.
Is mostly unfinished. But thanks.

717
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:56,629
So, what brings you to my neck
of the woods, Miss, uh, Horowitz?

718
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:03,907
I found it in a pile of junk
Kapoor was gonna sell to the melters.

719
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:06,072
Is yours, isn't it?

720
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:10,380
How did that get in...
It musve fell in there somehow. Jesus!

721
01:02:10,486 --> 01:02:12,386
Twenty-two carat gold.

722
01:02:12,488 --> 01:02:15,389
Whatever stone you had in it is gone.
I'm sorry.

723
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,328
It was never there.

724
01:02:21,764 --> 01:02:25,530
- I made this for my muse.
- For who?

725
01:02:25,635 --> 01:02:28,695
My muse.
My inspiration.

726
01:02:28,805 --> 01:02:31,433
Who is that?

727
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:33,441
I don't know.

728
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:37,843
But... when I meet her,
I'll know what stone
to put in there.

729
01:02:37,947 --> 01:02:40,245
Hmm.

730
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:42,340
Hey, Ramon...

731
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:44,851
Kapoor doesn't have a clue, does he?

732
01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:50,320
Does anyone in the trade know?

733
01:02:50,426 --> 01:02:53,293
- Know what?
- Know what you can do.

734
01:02:55,097 --> 01:02:57,657
Listen, I got a job.

735
01:02:57,767 --> 01:03:02,636
You know, this is a hobby,
a distraction. Thas all. Is not...

736
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:05,138
I want to commission your designs.

737
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:08,267
And I don't know from sculpture...

738
01:03:08,377 --> 01:03:13,542
but other than a few Florentine antiques
that passed through my father's store...

739
01:03:13,649 --> 01:03:17,085
I've never seen any jewelry
as beautiful as yours in my life.

740
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:22,788
I am very moved, Mrs...

741
01:03:22,892 --> 01:03:24,792
Sonia.

742
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:28,826
I am moved, Sonia.

743
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:32,367
But we don't know each other.

744
01:03:32,468 --> 01:03:36,768
Do you want this for me,
or do you want this... for you?

745
01:03:36,873 --> 01:03:38,773
Does it matter?

746
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,208
Sonia?

747
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:24,948
Mendel?

748
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:28,421
What are you doing lurking
out here in the dark?

749
01:04:28,524 --> 01:04:31,391
- Where's Shimmie?
- He's by Rachel.

750
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:35,225
- Oy gevalt. I better go get him.
- He'll be all right.

751
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:38,232
I said...
he'll be all right.

752
01:04:44,373 --> 01:04:47,274
- Where have you been?
- Working.

753
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:52,311
- What is all this?
- Oh, they're samples...

754
01:04:52,415 --> 01:04:55,748
from a jeweler I'm going
to be representing as part
of my work for Sender.

755
01:04:55,851 --> 01:05:00,345
- Look.
- I told Sender you won't
be working for him anymore.

756
01:05:01,657 --> 01:05:04,922
I've asked him to replace you
as soon as possible.

757
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:12,999
Well, what did,
what did Sender say?

758
01:05:13,102 --> 01:05:16,003
What did Sender say?

759
01:05:16,105 --> 01:05:19,097
I'm your husband, Sonia.
By you, Sender does what I ask.

760
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,733
I told him you were needed here at home
and that was the end of it.

761
01:05:21,844 --> 01:05:25,473
- Mendel, all the women around here work.
- Yes, they work.

762
01:05:25,581 --> 01:05:27,674
But their husbands don't get snickered
at by everyone in the neighborhood...

763
01:05:27,783 --> 01:05:29,808
as soon as his back is turned.

764
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:31,978
Why should they snicker?

765
01:05:32,088 --> 01:05:35,649
If I knew that I wouldn't be
standing here asking you about it.

766
01:05:35,758 --> 01:05:40,821
Is that what you're doing?
You're asking me about it?

767
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:45,333
Sonia...
Sonia, I know that you've got...

768
01:05:47,937 --> 01:05:51,202
We've got problems.

769
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:54,174
I-I talked to some people about it,
some people who know about these things.

770
01:05:54,276 --> 01:05:56,437
Please, Sonia.

771
01:05:56,545 --> 01:06:00,208
I realize I've been too busy at
the yeshiva with my own learning to do...

772
01:06:00,316 --> 01:06:03,615
To give you the attention you deserve.
I also realize...

773
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:06,620
that we are in desperate need
of help right now.

774
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,418
What kind of help, Mendel?

775
01:06:11,527 --> 01:06:14,655
I'd like for us
to see a counselor.

776
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:16,823
A marriage counselor, a psychologist.

777
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:20,368
Someone who specializes in problems
married people are having.

778
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:24,805
Do you pray every morning,
Mrs. Horowitz?

779
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:30,704
Do you pray, Mrs. Horowitz?

780
01:06:30,813 --> 01:06:32,804
You said...

781
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:35,315
I thought you were a psychologist.

782
01:06:35,418 --> 01:06:39,650
I am a psychologist, Mrs. Horowitz,
but I'm also a rabbi...

783
01:06:39,755 --> 01:06:44,124
uniquely qualified to appreciate
the problems afflicting the Jewish soul.

784
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:48,629
Which is unique in that it is directly
connected to the spirit of the Holy One.

785
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:50,824
Blessed be His name.

786
01:06:50,933 --> 01:06:53,800
Sonia, can we give the doctor a chance?

787
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:59,464
So? Hmm?
Do you pray, Mrs. Horowitz?

788
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:01,440
No.

789
01:07:01,544 --> 01:07:04,809
- Have you been to the mikveh?
- Not this month.

790
01:07:04,914 --> 01:07:08,850
- Are you lighting shabbes candles?
- If I get in on time.

791
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:11,010
- Have you been keeping kosher?
- At home.

792
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,317
- At home?
- Now we're getting somewhere.

793
01:07:14,423 --> 01:07:17,324
- Where exactly is it that we're getting?
- Well, is clear...

794
01:07:17,426 --> 01:07:20,691
that you've been neglecting
your relationship with the Almighty...

795
01:07:20,796 --> 01:07:23,492
- which, in psychological terms,
is translated into behavior...
- I thought...

796
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,261
I thought that you said
he was going to be impartial.

797
01:07:26,368 --> 01:07:28,268
Whose side is he taking?
I don't see.

798
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:31,737
He's taking Goïs side, Mendel.
Thas whose side he's taking.

799
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:35,902
You can't choose sides
with the Lord, Mrs. Horowitz.

800
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:40,613
You don't tell me
what I can and can't do.

801
01:07:40,716 --> 01:07:43,014
I'm gonna pick whatever side I want.

802
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,451
And if God happens to be
on the other end...

803
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:49,354
well thas just the way
is gonna be.

804
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:52,894
Sonia, sometimes the way you talk,
I mean, don't you fear God?

805
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:58,559
I'm tired of being afraid.

806
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:02,569
If I'm so offensive
in His eyes...

807
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:04,730
then let Him do
what He wants to me.

808
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,708
- I really don't care anymore.
- How can you be so blind?

809
01:08:08,811 --> 01:08:11,541
Don't you see the kind of suffering
that you're asking for?

810
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:15,981
Mendel, my learned husband...

811
01:08:16,085 --> 01:08:19,452
we don't suffer because we ask for it.

812
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:23,514
We suffer because
thas just the way it is.

813
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:25,958
There is no reason for it.

814
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,529
And if there is,
then is certainly something...

815
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:32,499
that neither you nor you
knows anything about.

816
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:36,128
We bring suffering on ourselves,
Mrs. Horowitz, when we sin against God.

817
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,740
Really.

818
01:08:41,677 --> 01:08:45,272
And my, my aunts and uncles?

819
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:47,645
And all their children...

820
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,742
who were marched into
the gas chambers at Treblinka?

821
01:08:50,853 --> 01:08:53,515
My Aunt Chani who watched her son...

822
01:08:53,622 --> 01:08:57,649
tortured in front of her eyes?

823
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,820
What the hell did they do
to deserve that?

824
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,191
And Yossi.

825
01:09:07,303 --> 01:09:12,172
He was only ten years old.
What did he do?

826
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:15,710
We don't question
the ways of God, Mrs. Horowitz.

827
01:09:15,811 --> 01:09:17,369
- We just...
- No!

828
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:20,505
You don't question...

829
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:22,516
Dr. Rabbi.

830
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:26,520
I'm gonna question
whatever I want to.

831
01:09:28,857 --> 01:09:32,486
But since I'm not likely
to find any answers here...

832
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:38,593
Is Sender home?

833
01:09:38,701 --> 01:09:41,135
- Mendel, are you all right?
- Is my brother home?

834
01:09:41,237 --> 01:09:43,296
Yes, of course.
He's in his study.

835
01:09:43,405 --> 01:09:46,135
Why don't you wait right over here?
I'll go get him.

836
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:48,142
Shah!
Everyone to your rooms.

837
01:09:48,244 --> 01:09:51,441
On the double. Double time.
March. Les go, les go.

838
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:16,236
Why?

839
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:19,000
Why what?

840
01:10:19,108 --> 01:10:22,339
Why is this happening to me?

841
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,479
Whas happening, Mendel?

842
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:27,947
Sonia's gone crazy.

843
01:10:33,389 --> 01:10:37,450
- What do you mean "crazy"?
- She's running around
like a meshuggener thing.

844
01:10:37,559 --> 01:10:39,754
Such things, I don't know
where she gets them from.

845
01:10:39,862 --> 01:10:41,762
About God. About...

846
01:10:41,864 --> 01:10:45,561
I don't know. I-I, I don't know
what she's talking about.

847
01:10:45,668 --> 01:10:49,069
She just sounds a little wound up.
I'm sure she'll calm down soon.

848
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:54,738
What have I done?
What have I done wrong?

849
01:10:57,112 --> 01:10:59,012
Nothing.

850
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,915
- You're a tzaddik, Mendel.
- Then why is this happening to me?

851
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,921
Because you've never
done anything wrong.

852
01:11:10,826 --> 01:11:13,294
Sender...

853
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:15,989
I don't know what to do.

854
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:17,998
Please.

855
01:11:19,101 --> 01:11:21,797
Help me.

856
01:11:23,305 --> 01:11:25,535
This is an excellent
representative selection...

857
01:11:25,641 --> 01:11:28,109
of the designer's skill
and versatility, Mr. Berman.

858
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:30,110
Is a little confusing.

859
01:11:30,212 --> 01:11:34,979
I mean, to someone with a smidgen of
taste, this work might border on kitsch.

860
01:11:35,084 --> 01:11:38,212
But there's a purity
to the classical influences.

861
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,120
And a boldness to the modern flourishes
that totally belies that.

862
01:11:42,224 --> 01:11:45,819
It also enhances
the appearance of the wearer...

863
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:49,329
without drawing
undue attention to itself.

864
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:54,827
I apologize for lack
of a better model.

865
01:11:54,937 --> 01:11:58,373
Uh, but with some imagination,
I'm sure that you'll see...

866
01:11:58,474 --> 01:12:02,501
- a world of possibilities.
- Yes. And without as much imagination...

867
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:04,602
as you might think.

868
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:10,143
Uh, here's an example...

869
01:12:12,254 --> 01:12:15,155
of the designer's work
in fine metals.

870
01:12:15,257 --> 01:12:19,387
Is 22-carat gold, hand-carved,
one-of-a-kind, with an open setting...

871
01:12:19,495 --> 01:12:21,486
for a gemstone.

872
01:12:21,597 --> 01:12:25,590
The perfection of this piece is clear,
even to the naked eye.

873
01:12:25,701 --> 01:12:29,193
If you can bear to part
with these samples, I'd like
to show them to my partners.

874
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:34,401
- Of course.
- I'd also like yourself and Mr...

875
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:39,206
- Garcia. Ramon Garcia.
- Yes.

876
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,942
I'd like you to meet
my manufacturer.

877
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,678
He's in town every Thursday.
We can make an appointment...

878
01:12:44,787 --> 01:12:47,847
- in a couple of weeks.
- This week.

879
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:50,083
This week would be best.

880
01:12:52,194 --> 01:12:54,685
I'll see what I can do.

881
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:58,733
I'll just...
hold on to this piece.

882
01:13:00,969 --> 01:13:03,665
Is one of a kind,
and I'm sure they'll be able to see...

883
01:13:03,772 --> 01:13:06,240
what they need to see
from the rest of the selection.

884
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:19,712
Damn!
Can you believe this?

885
01:13:19,822 --> 01:13:22,791
She bugged out on me.
I can't find anybody to replace her.

886
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:25,451
I'm getting it.

887
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:29,526
Is nice.

888
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:31,531
Nice?

889
01:13:31,633 --> 01:13:34,932
- You hear that, Ty? You look nice.
- Yo, leave her alone, Ray.

890
01:13:35,037 --> 01:13:38,097
- You're embarrassing her.
- The sculpture...
The sculpture looks nice.

891
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:44,071
Don't ask.

892
01:13:44,179 --> 01:13:46,079
Whas all this?

893
01:13:46,181 --> 01:13:48,308
Gold chachkes.
Junk.

894
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:50,749
I can see that.
Why is it all over my table?

895
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:53,947
You can melt it all down
and start to work on some pieces...

896
01:13:54,056 --> 01:13:56,183
- to augment your portfolio.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

897
01:13:56,291 --> 01:14:00,785
I got a job. A real fuckin' job
to hold on to. I told you.

898
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:05,060
- This is all just a hobby.
- You seem to be working on it
awfully hard for just a hobby.

899
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:08,728
Hey! Who are you, lady?

900
01:14:08,837 --> 01:14:10,737
I mean, I just met you.

901
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:15,276
And you come busting in here
like your ass is on fire,
telling me how to live my life?

902
01:14:15,377 --> 01:14:17,277
Is this how you want to go on?

903
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:19,313
Wasting your talent?

904
01:14:19,414 --> 01:14:22,178
Working for some cheap
junk macher day in, day out...

905
01:14:22,284 --> 01:14:25,253
just so you can hold on to,
what, some lousy job?

906
01:14:29,258 --> 01:14:31,818
I don't know where you come from.

907
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:34,760
But around here, thas a hell
of a lot more than most people got.

908
01:14:34,863 --> 01:14:38,594
So don't go laughing it off
like it ain't shit, all right?

909
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:42,261
This shis gettin' too deep
for my shiverin' ass.

910
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:45,431
- I'm gonna leave you...
- Yo, stay right there. We not done yet.

911
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:49,978
Ramon, you're an artist.
I just wanna help you.

912
01:14:50,078 --> 01:14:53,377
Do you wanna help me?
Come here. Come over here.

913
01:14:53,482 --> 01:14:56,178
- What?
- Come here.

914
01:14:57,452 --> 01:14:59,352
Oh, no. No, Ramon.

915
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,355
- No, come on.
Just so I can get this angle, okay?
- Ramon.

916
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:04,652
- Come on.
- I, I shouldn't be so close.

917
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,921
No. Hey, is okay.
You know?

918
01:15:07,029 --> 01:15:08,997
- It isn't really you.
- Ramon.

919
01:15:09,097 --> 01:15:12,999
Just use your imagination, okay?
This is art. Remember?

920
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:16,662
This is the Garden of Eden.
Right? There's no shame here.

921
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:19,935
This is Adam, and you're Eve.

922
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:23,671
- And I suppose that makes you the snake?
- The devil in disguise.

923
01:15:23,779 --> 01:15:27,738
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Snake.
I hate to tell you, but this Eve
is keeping her clothes on.

924
01:15:27,849 --> 01:15:31,717
- No, no, is okay.
Just put your hand like this.
- No.

925
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,380
- Come on, Ray...
- Put it right there. All right?

926
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:39,760
No!

927
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:46,333
Smooth, homes.

928
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:57,176
Sonia. Sonia!

929
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:00,180
I can't believe
I did that to you, man.

930
01:16:02,618 --> 01:16:04,176
Just, uh...

931
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:08,186
You fuckin' scared me, all right?

932
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:13,159
My father used to say that a jeweler's
work is the expression of his soul.

933
01:16:13,261 --> 01:16:17,630
Your work is beautiful, Ramon.
But whas the point
if nobody's going to know about it?

934
01:16:17,733 --> 01:16:21,294
You'll know.

935
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:23,303
Seems like you had
a wise old man.

936
01:16:23,405 --> 01:16:26,772
I never knew mine.

937
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:31,073
My mother, she' ain't got nobody in this
whole world but me and Jesus Christ.

938
01:16:31,179 --> 01:16:33,773
And He don't seem to be makin'
no grocery runs these days.

939
01:16:33,882 --> 01:16:35,440
Know what I'm sayin'?

940
01:16:37,653 --> 01:16:41,248
How do I know you're gonna
come through for me?

941
01:16:41,356 --> 01:16:44,814
You don't.
But thas life, isn't it?

942
01:16:48,797 --> 01:16:50,992
Just give me a little time.

943
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:55,632
I'm running out of time.

944
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:39,706
Mendel?

945
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:46,485
The locks to my house
have been changed.

946
01:17:46,588 --> 01:17:49,955
Your house? You've hardly set foot
in that door for months.

947
01:17:50,058 --> 01:17:52,891
- Now suddenly is your house.
- Where's Shimmie?

948
01:17:52,994 --> 01:17:55,224
He's sleeping.

949
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,493
- Don't get between me and my baby.
- Your baby.

950
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,501
You've hardly seen hide nor hair of him
for months. Now suddenly he's your baby.

951
01:18:01,603 --> 01:18:04,436
- You sound like a broken record, Rachel.
- Sit down!

952
01:18:04,539 --> 01:18:06,871
Um, ladies,
I think it might be a good idea...

953
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:10,968
Grab your coat, round up the kids and
take them to daven maariv up at shul.

954
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:14,378
Right. Thas what
I was gonna do. Shul.

955
01:18:15,617 --> 01:18:18,051
I think you'd better
sit down.

956
01:18:27,429 --> 01:18:29,329
Is over.

957
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:33,492
Mendel will be granting you a divorce
at the earliest possible moment.

958
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,300
He's going to stay in the house.
And Sender has agreed...

959
01:18:37,405 --> 01:18:40,738
to let you use an apartment
he's been keeping for business
on the Lower East Side.

960
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:43,606
You are not welcome here anymore.

961
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:49,211
Is this coming from Mendel,
or is this coming from you?

962
01:18:49,317 --> 01:18:51,217
What do you think?

963
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:53,913
Where is Mendel?
I want to hear this from his mouth.

964
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:56,422
Haven't you put him
through enough already?

965
01:18:58,293 --> 01:19:00,693
I'll just take Shimmie
and be on my way.

966
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:03,287
Shimmie stays here.

967
01:19:03,398 --> 01:19:05,195
How dare you!

968
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:08,201
Shimmie's gonna stay here by us where
he can live in a healthy environment.

969
01:19:08,303 --> 01:19:11,363
And who's the expert fit to judge whas
a healthy environment all of a sudden?

970
01:19:11,473 --> 01:19:14,533
Certainly not a woman who leaves
her husband and baby at home...

971
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:18,306
while she runs around town
having affairs with Puerto Ricans.

972
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:22,577
Is that what this is all about?
Who said this?

973
01:19:22,684 --> 01:19:25,084
It doesn't matter.
Whas done is done.

974
01:19:25,187 --> 01:19:28,816
And whas said is said, and the truth
doesn't matter anymore. Does it?

975
01:19:28,924 --> 01:19:32,155
If you don't get out of my way,
I'm gonna call the cops.

976
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:35,787
I'm taking Shimmie and I'm going back
to Muncie to stay by my mother.

977
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:39,799
We already spoke to your mother.

978
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:44,600
She begged us not to let you go back
there and ruin your sisters' chances...

979
01:19:44,706 --> 01:19:47,300
of making decent matches.

980
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:51,505
We have a fine life here, Sonia.

981
01:19:51,613 --> 01:19:54,411
A decent life.

982
01:19:54,516 --> 01:19:58,418
And you are not gonna be allowed
to destroy it for everyone around you.

983
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:02,917
For the good of all concerned,
you've gotta be cut off.

984
01:20:03,024 --> 01:20:06,755
You can't cut a mother off
from her child.

985
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:11,492
No. You've already taken care
of that yourself.

986
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:16,631
I don't know where
you're headed, Sonia.

987
01:20:16,738 --> 01:20:19,138
But wherever it is,
you're going alone.

988
01:20:42,163 --> 01:20:44,063
Excuse me.

989
01:20:44,165 --> 01:20:46,497
Is Mendel here?

990
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:49,661
Mendel Horowitz.
Do me a favor.

991
01:20:49,771 --> 01:20:53,673
Go and find him for me.
Tell him his wife wants to talk to him.

992
01:21:13,929 --> 01:21:17,092
Excuse me. I think you should
find another time for this.

993
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:22,033
- Is he here?
- Like I said, I think perhaps
another time would be pref...

994
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:35,582
Mendel?

995
01:21:38,987 --> 01:21:41,080
Mendel?

996
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:44,124
Listen, Mrs. Horowitz...

997
01:21:44,225 --> 01:21:46,125
Is this it, Mendel?

998
01:21:46,227 --> 01:21:50,664
Is this how you want
to handle things?

999
01:22:06,281 --> 01:22:08,511
- Hi, Nelson.
- Sorry, Mrs. Horowitz.

1000
01:22:08,616 --> 01:22:10,811
- The store's off-limits.
- Excuse me?

1001
01:22:10,919 --> 01:22:14,377
Mr. Sender's orders.
Can't let you in.

1002
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:18,289
Listen to me, Nelson. There are things
in there that belong to me.

1003
01:22:18,393 --> 01:22:22,659
They are mine. I will go in, I'll get
them. I'll be out in ten minutes.

1004
01:22:22,764 --> 01:22:26,461
Can't do it.
Good night, Mrs. Horowitz.

1005
01:23:28,797 --> 01:23:30,890
Welcome home.

1006
01:23:39,174 --> 01:23:44,635
"An apartment he keeps for business,"
his sister says.

1007
01:23:44,746 --> 01:23:48,147
I wonder what she'd say...

1008
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:52,185
if she knew what kind
of transactions occurred here.

1009
01:23:53,254 --> 01:23:55,415
Make yourself comfortable.

1010
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:57,753
A bed.

1011
01:23:57,859 --> 01:24:01,226
I woulïve expected
a desk or a table...

1012
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:03,729
or maybe just the wall.

1013
01:24:03,832 --> 01:24:06,733
Who'd have thought
you'd have time for a bed?

1014
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:16,440
Your bitter tone strikes me
as inappropriate...

1015
01:24:16,544 --> 01:24:19,638
considering I've given you
exactly what you want.

1016
01:24:19,747 --> 01:24:22,272
And what is that?

1017
01:24:22,383 --> 01:24:24,476
Your freedom.

1018
01:24:24,586 --> 01:24:26,486
You're free of Mendel.

1019
01:24:26,588 --> 01:24:30,456
You're free of all the everyday
responsibilities that you hate.

1020
01:24:30,558 --> 01:24:35,188
You're free to work at a trade you
enjoy, and live in any manner you wish.

1021
01:24:35,296 --> 01:24:37,196
Free.

1022
01:24:39,067 --> 01:24:40,967
And you?

1023
01:24:46,174 --> 01:24:48,734
Am I free of you, Sender?

1024
01:24:50,078 --> 01:24:52,876
Freedom always comes
with a price.

1025
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:59,584
And... whas your price?

1026
01:24:59,687 --> 01:25:03,179
A price above that
of your virtue...

1027
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:06,454
but a price far below rubies.

1028
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,528
You'll have nothing, Sonia.

1029
01:25:14,636 --> 01:25:17,434
Not even this room. Nothing.

1030
01:25:35,723 --> 01:25:38,248
I'm not paying anymore.

1031
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:52,371
Yeah, sh-she told me, lmma.
Rachel told me that she talked to you.

1032
01:25:52,473 --> 01:25:55,931
But, um, I-I just wanted to call...

1033
01:25:56,044 --> 01:26:00,071
and, uh, a-and make sure that, um...

1034
01:26:01,683 --> 01:26:03,878
No, don't worry.

1035
01:26:03,985 --> 01:26:07,079
No, I-I, I won't be coming home.

1036
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:10,289
Don't worry.

1037
01:26:30,345 --> 01:26:33,212
Whas the rush?
You're late for a party?

1038
01:26:36,851 --> 01:26:38,751
I'm lost.

1039
01:26:38,853 --> 01:26:42,516
You're in the middle of Manhattan.
2nd Avenue and 3rd Street.

1040
01:26:42,624 --> 01:26:45,718
The "J" train, three blocks east.
The I.R.T.'s just around the corner.

1041
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:49,695
- Nobody's lost here.
- Who are you?

1042
01:26:49,797 --> 01:26:53,528
I'm just a woman who's been too long
on her tired feet.

1043
01:26:53,635 --> 01:26:57,503
Now I'm gonna rest.
You want to join me?

1044
01:27:04,112 --> 01:27:07,548
You've been following me
ever since I moved to Boro Park.

1045
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,443
Who's been following who?

1046
01:27:24,766 --> 01:27:27,166
A little manners
wouldn't kill you.

1047
01:27:27,268 --> 01:27:30,533
I'm not taking from a woman
who has nothing.

1048
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,776
Actually, I have very little.
You're the one who has nothing.

1049
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:40,178
How would you know that?

1050
01:27:40,281 --> 01:27:42,181
We have a mutual acquaintance.

1051
01:27:44,419 --> 01:27:47,183
She's old.

1052
01:27:47,288 --> 01:27:50,189
As old as God Himself.

1053
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:53,488
She's beautiful
and very wise.

1054
01:27:53,594 --> 01:27:55,926
But we hate and fear her...

1055
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:59,488
when we should be making her
our trusted ally.

1056
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,034
This makes her bitter and vengeful.

1057
01:28:02,136 --> 01:28:05,936
And she burns us
in the flames of her spite.

1058
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:07,974
She's sensitive.

1059
01:28:08,076 --> 01:28:10,670
Not very forgiving.

1060
01:28:10,778 --> 01:28:14,305
But if you learn to embrace her,
you will have made a valuable friend.

1061
01:28:17,852 --> 01:28:20,753
And whas God got to say
about all that?

1062
01:28:20,855 --> 01:28:25,622
Hmph. Better to stay
on His good side too.

1063
01:28:30,732 --> 01:28:33,200
Is a little late for that in my case.

1064
01:28:33,301 --> 01:28:36,361
Aah! He's an old bully.

1065
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:39,133
Best to keep bullies
in their place, I say.

1066
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,674
Even the big ones?

1067
01:28:41,776 --> 01:28:44,438
Especially the big ones.

1068
01:30:24,846 --> 01:30:26,746
Bubbie?

1069
01:31:05,286 --> 01:31:07,982
- Where's Shimmie?
- Shimmie? Is 3:00 a.m.

1070
01:31:08,089 --> 01:31:10,751
- He's sleeping in the kids' room.
- Thank you.

1071
01:31:10,858 --> 01:31:13,383
- Mendel, are you all right?
- Yes.

1072
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:23,359
Mendel?
Mendel, what are you doing?

1073
01:31:25,506 --> 01:31:27,633
I'm taking my son home.

1074
01:31:27,742 --> 01:31:30,142
Mendel, listen to me.
I understand how you feel.

1075
01:31:30,244 --> 01:31:33,179
- But Shimmie needs to stay...
- Shimmie's my son.

1076
01:31:33,281 --> 01:31:36,307
And from now on,
Shimmie's gonna sleep by me.

1077
01:31:36,417 --> 01:31:38,817
I'll appreciate your help
during the days while I'm teaching.

1078
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:42,151
But from this moment on, every night
I'm gonna do my own learning at home...

1079
01:31:42,256 --> 01:31:44,383
instead of the beit midrash.

1080
01:31:44,492 --> 01:31:47,984
And when I'm home,
Shimmie's gonna sleep by me.

1081
01:31:48,095 --> 01:31:50,859
Mendel, this is not
just about what you want.

1082
01:31:50,965 --> 01:31:53,957
- Shimmie needs...
- Thas enough, Rachel!

1083
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:59,205
I'll get together a couple guys
from the beit midrash.

1084
01:31:59,307 --> 01:32:01,901
We'll be happy to come over nights
and learn at your house.

1085
01:32:03,511 --> 01:32:05,570
We'll learn by you.

1086
01:33:02,637 --> 01:33:04,537
Jesus.

1087
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:13,246
Ramon, I'm sorry
to wake you up like this.

1088
01:33:14,982 --> 01:33:17,382
I wasn't sleeping.

1089
01:33:25,726 --> 01:33:30,288
After you, uh, took off down the street,
you know, the other day...

1090
01:33:33,267 --> 01:33:37,169
the way you was talking, I thought
I was never gonna see you again.

1091
01:33:38,906 --> 01:33:41,306
I cleaned off my table, you know.

1092
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:44,769
I ain't stopped working since.

1093
01:33:46,814 --> 01:33:51,376
I mean, the whole time
I was thinking about the way
you was walking, you know...

1094
01:33:51,485 --> 01:33:55,444
with your back held up all
straight like you was cracking,
but you wouldn't break.

1095
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:00,953
They are so beautiful.

1096
01:34:10,538 --> 01:34:12,438
All my life...

1097
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:17,068
I've been trying to make up
for my old man splitting, you know...

1098
01:34:17,178 --> 01:34:19,203
by looking out for my mom.

1099
01:34:26,454 --> 01:34:30,481
It ain't been easy, but...
I don't mind.

1100
01:34:30,591 --> 01:34:32,991
Then you walk in.

1101
01:34:34,795 --> 01:34:39,129
And I think, "Here's another desperate
woman that needs something from me."

1102
01:34:40,701 --> 01:34:42,601
But I was wrong.

1103
01:34:44,271 --> 01:34:46,569
I need you.

1104
01:34:46,674 --> 01:34:48,574
No.

1105
01:34:51,445 --> 01:34:55,279
You were right to be afraid of me.

1106
01:34:55,382 --> 01:34:59,512
I have destroyed every good thing
I have ever known!

1107
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:02,589
But I won't destroy you.

1108
01:35:04,325 --> 01:35:07,294
Sometimes a thing
has to be destroyed.

1109
01:35:07,394 --> 01:35:12,297
Walls got to be broke down
so you can see what they've
been hiding inside all along.

1110
01:35:15,803 --> 01:35:18,931
You can't even see yourself, can you?

1111
01:35:20,508 --> 01:35:22,408
Look!

1112
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:24,478
This is nice.

1113
01:35:25,846 --> 01:35:27,814
I agree.

1114
01:35:27,915 --> 01:35:30,406
Is nice.

1115
01:35:30,518 --> 01:35:32,486
But is a chachka.

1116
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,947
A nice little chachka.

1117
01:35:38,259 --> 01:35:40,159
This, look.

1118
01:35:45,366 --> 01:35:47,698
Is a chain, Sonia.

1119
01:35:47,802 --> 01:35:50,202
Thas all it is, a chain.

1120
01:35:56,744 --> 01:35:58,644
Now look at yourself.

1121
01:36:39,053 --> 01:36:41,021
Look at you.

1122
01:37:30,671 --> 01:37:32,571
Sonia?

1123
01:37:34,942 --> 01:37:36,500
Yossi.

1124
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:42,381
I swam.

1125
01:37:43,918 --> 01:37:45,476
Me too.

1126
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:54,620
- Yes?
- Is the Rebbitzn home?

1127
01:38:55,856 --> 01:38:57,756
What can I do for you?

1128
01:38:57,858 --> 01:39:00,383
I'd like to see
the Rebbitzn, please.

1129
01:39:00,494 --> 01:39:04,828
The Rebbitzn is still in mourning.
She doesn't grant audience to strangers.

1130
01:39:04,932 --> 01:39:07,332
My name is Sonia.
Please tell her...

1131
01:39:07,434 --> 01:39:10,232
that I am respectfully requesting
a moment of her time.

1132
01:39:10,337 --> 01:39:13,636
I'm sorry, but like I said,
the Rebbitzn won't...

1133
01:39:21,215 --> 01:39:23,115
Make yourself decent...

1134
01:39:23,217 --> 01:39:25,378
before you come in.

1135
01:39:25,486 --> 01:39:28,080
If you don't like the way I look,
then look at your shoes.

1136
01:39:28,188 --> 01:39:31,021
Or stick your nose in a book.
Is your problem, not mine.

1137
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:38,289
I'm sorry, Rebbitzn,
but this woman...

1138
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:41,527
- wouldn't listen...
- Yakov.

1139
01:39:55,382 --> 01:39:58,681
At the Rebbe's eulogy...

1140
01:39:58,786 --> 01:40:01,846
may his memory be a blessing,
you came to me.

1141
01:40:02,923 --> 01:40:05,050
You said...

1142
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:07,184
Thank you.

1143
01:40:07,294 --> 01:40:09,489
Why?

1144
01:40:18,305 --> 01:40:23,072
I was here when you spoke
to Moishe on that day.

1145
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:29,471
Your words rekindled a fire...

1146
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:32,484
in a body too old to contain it.

1147
01:40:33,654 --> 01:40:37,090
Like a flash he was consumed.

1148
01:40:42,196 --> 01:40:44,824
His eyes were looking into mine.

1149
01:40:46,867 --> 01:40:49,995
And the last words to pass his lips...

1150
01:40:50,104 --> 01:40:52,766
before he left this world...

1151
01:40:52,873 --> 01:40:56,206
were, "I love you."

1152
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:06,710
It was the first time
in 20 years...

1153
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,880
that he spoke those words to me.

1154
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:14,822
You took a man away
from his people forever.

1155
01:41:14,928 --> 01:41:20,298
But for one night,
you gave a wife back her husband.

1156
01:41:21,435 --> 01:41:24,199
Perhaps I sound selfish to you...

1157
01:41:24,304 --> 01:41:27,137
but you are still young.

1158
01:41:27,241 --> 01:41:29,505
I am very old.

1159
01:41:31,512 --> 01:41:33,412
Someday...

1160
01:41:33,514 --> 01:41:37,177
you might understand me.

1161
01:41:37,284 --> 01:41:39,775
I understand you.

1162
01:41:42,222 --> 01:41:44,122
But with all due respect...

1163
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:47,421
I'm not planning on waiting
for someday.

1164
01:41:47,528 --> 01:41:50,986
I don't belong here.

1165
01:41:51,098 --> 01:41:53,089
I know that now...

1166
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:56,101
and I've paid
a heavy price for it.

1167
01:41:56,203 --> 01:41:59,138
I'm leaving my child here.

1168
01:42:01,675 --> 01:42:05,839
Is for the best,
until I do know where I belong.

1169
01:42:10,384 --> 01:42:13,319
I accept your gratitude...

1170
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,446
for returning to you
what should have always been yours.

1171
01:42:16,557 --> 01:42:21,460
But now I'm asking you
to help me reclaim whas mine.

1172
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:53,191
Whas the meaning of this?

1173
01:42:53,293 --> 01:42:56,626
- You Sender's new guy?
- Mrs. Horowitz.

1174
01:42:56,730 --> 01:43:00,530
You look absolutely fantastic,
if I may say so.

1175
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:04,070
- Sit down, Mr. Fishbein.
I'm, I'm not in the mood.

1176
01:43:10,611 --> 01:43:14,103
I assume the combination
to the safe has been changed.

1177
01:43:14,214 --> 01:43:16,682
Would you be so kind
as to open it for me?

1178
01:43:16,783 --> 01:43:18,717
All these men were gabbaim
to the Rebbe.

1179
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:23,017
They'll be witnesses to the fact
that I will take only
whas mine and nothing more.

1180
01:43:23,123 --> 01:43:25,023
This is a joke?

1181
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:01,725
Now I'm free.

1182
01:44:16,476 --> 01:44:20,708
I couldn't bear the thought
of your muse going empty-handed.

1183
01:44:22,215 --> 01:44:25,616
I hope she'll be as inspiring to you
as you've been to me.

1184
01:44:28,488 --> 01:44:30,649
She already has been.

1185
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:45,800
Hold on to it for me.

1186
01:44:45,906 --> 01:44:49,171
Just for a little while.
Okay?

1187
01:44:53,547 --> 01:44:55,447
Sonia?

1188
01:44:55,549 --> 01:44:58,347
Where are you going?

1189
01:45:01,355 --> 01:45:03,846
I don't know.

1190
01:45:08,795 --> 01:45:11,286
If you need a place to...

1191
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,163
Stay here with me.

1192
01:45:15,268 --> 01:45:19,227
Ramon.

1193
01:45:20,774 --> 01:45:24,540
- There's someone upstairs
who wants to see you.

1194
01:45:26,947 --> 01:45:29,347
He says he's your husband.

1195
01:45:35,655 --> 01:45:37,885
I'm gonna talk to him.

1196
01:45:40,994 --> 01:45:45,556
Hey, you've got a life, you know.

1197
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:50,702
Do what you gotta do.

1198
01:45:50,804 --> 01:45:52,897
I ain't going anywhere.

1199
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,654
Mendel?

1200
01:46:11,324 --> 01:46:13,588
Sonia.

1201
01:46:13,693 --> 01:46:15,593
You look nice.

1202
01:46:18,698 --> 01:46:20,256
You too.

1203
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:27,434
Sender told me where I could find you,
in case you were wondering.

1204
01:46:27,541 --> 01:46:29,441
I wasn't.

1205
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,080
How's Shimmie?

1206
01:46:35,182 --> 01:46:38,413
He's good.
He stays by me now.

1207
01:46:38,518 --> 01:46:40,645
Oh, thas good.

1208
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:45,749
I'm sure he misses you.

1209
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:52,055
And you?

1210
01:46:52,165 --> 01:46:54,190
Do you miss me?

1211
01:47:00,674 --> 01:47:02,232
And you?

1212
01:47:20,794 --> 01:47:23,194
I-I came to tell you...

1213
01:47:28,635 --> 01:47:31,536
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday.

1214
01:47:35,108 --> 01:47:37,235
My birthday?

1215
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:40,245
Do you think thas
what all this was about?

1216
01:47:40,347 --> 01:47:42,542
Of course not.

1217
01:47:44,885 --> 01:47:47,649
I've been doing
a lot of thinking...

1218
01:47:47,754 --> 01:47:51,246
about things I never really understood
how to think about before.

1219
01:47:51,358 --> 01:47:54,885
I know that the pain we caused
each other couldn't be helped.

1220
01:47:54,995 --> 01:47:58,328
I am who I am
and you are who you are.

1221
01:47:58,431 --> 01:48:01,696
And we just weren't meant
to be together.

1222
01:48:01,801 --> 01:48:05,396
There was nothing we coulïve done
other than what we did.

1223
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:09,641
But I was wrong
to have forgotten your birthday.

1224
01:48:12,612 --> 01:48:15,172
Mendel, you know I,
I can't accept...

1225
01:48:15,282 --> 01:48:17,546
Please, if not for yourself,
then for me.

1226
01:48:17,651 --> 01:48:20,347
Yom Kippur is coming up
and I would like to face God...

1227
01:48:20,453 --> 01:48:22,546
knowing I tried
to do right by you.

1228
01:48:36,603 --> 01:48:39,128
A ruby.

1229
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:45,041
Is your birthstone.
I looked it up. I bought it loose.

1230
01:48:45,145 --> 01:48:49,605
I figured finding the right setting for
it is your specialty, so why interfere.

1231
01:48:52,452 --> 01:48:54,852
Please...

1232
01:48:54,955 --> 01:48:56,855
come by and visit...

1233
01:48:58,058 --> 01:49:01,084
on evenings or shabbes.

1234
01:49:02,729 --> 01:49:06,130
Shimmie should know
he has a mother who loves him.

1235
01:49:11,404 --> 01:49:15,101
- What would the others say?
- What others?

1236
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:18,268
As far as Shimmie
is concerned...

1237
01:49:18,378 --> 01:49:21,279
the only voices that matter
belong to his mother...

1238
01:49:22,449 --> 01:49:24,349
and his father.

1239
01:49:38,365 --> 01:49:40,265
Mendel?

1240
01:49:48,241 --> 01:49:50,732
God bless you.
