00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:08,550
[man narrating] <i>On a warm California day</i>
<i>at Pixar Animation Studios...</i>

2
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,221
<i>a familiar face has arrived
for a morning meeting.</i>

3
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,367
Let's go sit. Come on.
We'll talk about the day.

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,226
- Hello. Nice to see you.
- How are you?

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,936
- Come sit next to me.
- I know...

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,814
[narrator] <i>Bob Iger is the CEO</i>
<i>of The Walt Disney Company,</i>

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>which owns Pixar.</i>

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,485
<i>And these meetings,</i>

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,864
<i>the kind where he gets to talk ideas
with his creative people...</i>

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,158
<i>are the kind he loves.</i>

11
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,202
Well, I get to draw in the story.
[chuckling] At least let me do that.

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,123
<i>There are always new things
on the horizon to talk about.</i>

13
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>New concepts, new technology.</i>

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,793
Wow, it reached the Philippines.

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,170
<i>New possibilities.</i>

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,757
I mean, the stories, by nature,
are so hard to crack.

17
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,343
<i>And you never know when an old story</i>

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,013
<i>about his days in charge
of programming the Olympics on ABC</i>

19
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>might be good for a laugh as well.</i>

20
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,392
Everything starts to melt.

21
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,228
The bobsled run is melting.

22
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,191
And I've got nothing to put on, except
maybe Sweden versus Romania in hockey.

23
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,442
[people chuckle]

24
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,565
[narrator] <i>But ultimately,</i>

25
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,572
<i>he's always sure to remind his colleagues
of their greatest objective.</i>

26
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,117
A lot of what we do, what we make,
is to inspire audiences,

27
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:21,539
but it's just as valuable to us
and as fulfilling to us

28
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,625
when we inspire the people
who work for us too.

29
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,876
[male Pixar employee] Yeah.

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,587
[Iger] First of all,
I get motivated by great creativity.

31
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,130
- That's...
- [chuckling]

32
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,384
It's, you know, so much a part
of what we do as a company.

33
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:38,598
I get motivated by working
with an incredibly large and diverse group

34
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,767
of extremely talented people

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,561
that come to work every day
with a passion for what they do.

36
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,523
[narrator] <i>On any given day,</i>

37
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>in so many different places...</i>

38
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>you'll find countless ways
that people at Disney,</i>

39
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,698
<i>the cast members as they're called...</i>

40
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,826
<i>contribute to a common mission.</i>

41
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,496
[Ranft] The collaboration
is where it's most exciting.

42
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,379
[Mylniczenko]
We're very compassionate people.

43
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,542
You want to be able to solve problems.

44
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,712
[Roberts] I got in the habit
to be optimistic.

45
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,923
[Goldberg] I never thought
I'd be good enough to work at Disney.

46
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,968
[Lee] Every year for my birthday,
I would ask to go to Disneyland.

47
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,095
[Gonzales] It was that idea of adventure.

48
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,346
[Baker] <i>Star Wars</i> was something that
I never thought I would ever get to do.

49
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,395
[Meinerding] It is a joy that
we get to work on stuff that we all love.

50
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,230
[Girdich] I can create something

51
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,691
that I never thought could exist
in the physical world.

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,877
[Magudulela] I still get chills
when I'm... [chuckles] singing.

53
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,611
I feel like we're giving them a gift.

54
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,612
[narrator]
<i>These are the stories of what they do...</i>

55
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,242
<i>and what it means to them.</i>

56
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,039
<i>This is </i>One Day at Disney<i>.</i>

57
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,353
<i>Walt Disney,
the name so ingrained in the culture</i>

58
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,855
<i>it's almost easy to forget
it once belonged to a man...</i>

59
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,902
<i>who in the 1920s began a company founded,</i>

60
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,278
<i>more than anything else...</i>

61
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,031
<i>on the power of imagination.</i>

62
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,497
[Iger] Anytime a child goes
to his or her first movie

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,165
it's a memorable experience.

64
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:32,128
In my particular case, my grandparents
took me to see <i>Cinderella</i>,

65
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,090
when, I believe, I was four years old.

66
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:39,552
In Brooklyn, New York,
seeing a classic Disney film,

67
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,764
I think, was maybe fortuitous

68
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,849
because it stuck with me my whole life.

69
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,812
[Brown] <i>Iger is one of millions</i>
<i>who can tell that kind of story.</i>

70
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,357
<i>But across every generation,</i>

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,944
<i>Walt Disney's original passion has endured
at the company's heart...</i>

72
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,321
<i>animation.</i>

73
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,161
[Goldberg] I'm one of the guys
who gets to draw Mickey.

74
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:12,377
I take pride in the fact
that the studio trusts me enough.

75
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,173
It's kind of like being handed
the keys to the castle.

76
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:23,138
I remember the first time
that I drew Mickey in a public forum,

77
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,683
Roy Disney, Walt's nephew, was with us.

78
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:31,563
And I'm thinking to myself, "Oh, my God,
[chuckling] I better not screw this up."

79
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,902
When I was very young,
the first Disney movie I saw was <i>Dumbo</i>.

80
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,241
I was just absolutely struck...

81
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:49,247
by how wonderful animation looked
and made me feel.

82
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,418
It's life, pushed. [chuckles]

83
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,589
It's making something larger than life.

84
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,718
I was a very focused kid.

85
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,889
You know, knowing at a very early age
what I wanted to do.

86
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,142
I've made my key positions,

87
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:16,316
and now I'm putting the positions
in between to help flesh out the movement.

88
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,736
When I started making my Super 8 films,

89
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,823
my parents would willingly
give over the dining room table,

90
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,660
and I would lay out all my cels,
drying, you know, [chuckles]

91
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,748
and the living room would become
where I would shoot the stuff

92
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,500
on my downshooter.

93
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,460
Put a new sheet of paper down.

94
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,174
I never thought that I'd be good enough
to work at Disney.

95
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:48,056
Back in 1974,
I applied to their training program.

96
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,308
And the response was,

97
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,561
"Well, you didn't make it, Eric.
You're not good enough."

98
00:05:55,855 --> 00:06:00,777
In the late '80s, in London,
I was running my own animation studio.

99
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,948
It was a very successful
commercials company.

100
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,412
But I was getting very stressed out
working on commercials.

101
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:15,792
I go to an animation festival
in Los Angeles, bringing my reel,

102
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,920
and there are a couple
of Disney guys there.

103
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,507
One was Charlie Fink,

104
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,802
who just kept calling me once a month.

105
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,431
"You wanna jump ship yet, huh?
You wanna join Disney's yet, huh?"

106
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,642
Charlie finally dropped the bombshell.

107
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,604
He said, "They're thinking of doing
this film <i>Aladdin</i>.

108
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,691
And they're thinking
of getting Robin Williams."

109
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,611
I just thought,
"Okay, if I don't do this now,

110
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,864
I'm gonna miss the crest of a wave."

111
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,786
My first week at Disney,

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,332
and I'm starting to draw
developmental sketches of the Genie.

113
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,751
And here we are.

114
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:04,174
If you look at Mickey,
he's got this organic way of being drawn

115
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,634
where one line leads to the next.

116
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,470
Same thing with the Genie.

117
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,222
You know, you've got all these lines

118
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,018
that kind of add up to something whole.

119
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:20,190
So, I started doing Robin William-esque
Genies in my designs.

120
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942
John and Ron said,

121
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:28,406
"Why don't you take a couple
of Robin's bits off his comedy records

122
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,825
and animate a Genie to them?"

123
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,053
But first, before we do the play,

124
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,388
I'd like to talk about
the very serious subject of schizophrenia.

125
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,681
- No, he doesn't.
- Shut up! Let him talk!

126
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,706
[audience laughs]

127
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,127
[Goldberg] And I have to say,
it's one of the great joys of my life

128
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,546
to have made Robin Williams laugh.

129
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,216
[screams]

130
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,550
- Oy!
- [bones crack]

131
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,889
Ten thousand years
will give you such a crick in the neck!

132
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,534
[Goldberg] I was in the right place
at the right time.

133
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,852
Animation, all of a sudden, is hip again.

134
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:04,275
<i>Aladdin</i> was getting towards that peak
of what people call the Renaissance.

135
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,444
Welcome to my wall.

136
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,113
[chuckles]

137
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,408
The Shanghai assignment was great.

138
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:16,121
They wanted to decorate a restaurant
in Shanghai Disneyland,

139
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,041
à la Hirschfeld/Sardi's.

140
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,920
I even got to do modern characters
like Anna and Elsa.

141
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:28,466
Whenever I have to draw characters
from the Disney canon,

142
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,053
I always feel all those people
who created those characters

143
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,806
looking over my shoulder saying,
"Do it right."

144
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,890
[chuckles]

145
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:41,688
Often, they would straddle two drawings
like this with Gaston and LeFou.

146
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:47,068
Every one of these movies has a theme
and they're universal.

147
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:51,364
How many people of our generation
grew up dealing with death

148
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,700
because they saw Bambi's mother die?

149
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,285
[calling] Mother?

150
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,829
♪ <i>I've got no strings</i>
<i>To hold me do...</i> ♪

151
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,056
[Goldberg] With <i>Pinocchio</i>, it's,

152
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,416
"Always let your conscience
be your guide."

153
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,296
In the case of <i>Aladdin</i>,
the theme was, "Be yourself."

154
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,633
And even though, yes,
they do deal with serious subjects,

155
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,472
you always walk out of a Disney film
delighted and feeling like...

156
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,766
"Yeah, that was great.

157
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,393
I think I'm gonna see it again."

158
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,644
[chuckles]

159
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,777
Walt Disney's name is the company's name.

160
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,571
I'm reminded every day
that I come to work,

161
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,533
when I drive onto the Disney lot,
of the company's heritage.

162
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,996
I never lose sight of not only
the significance of that

163
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,332
but of just how fortunate
I consider myself.

164
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,753
Now we want you to share with us
our latest and greatest dream.

165
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,173
That's it. Right here.

166
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,175
Disneyland.

167
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,389
[Brown] <i>When Walt Disney</i>
<i>built Disneyland in the 1950s,</i>

168
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,101
<i>the park was designed
to inspire a timeless sense of adventure</i>

169
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,561
<i>for visitors of all ages.</i>

170
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,438
Look it. I got something for ya.

171
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,710
- You're gonna pin that onto your shirt.
- Oh, you wanna wear that?

172
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,755
- Wow. You're gonna wear it on your shirt?
- [Gonzales] That's a conductor badge.

173
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,492
Ours is not just a mode of transportation,
as I don't like to think of it that way.

174
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,119
Come on in, guys. Welcome aboard.

175
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:26,334
Here at Disneyland,
we try to recreate that idea of traveling

176
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,503
to get to somewhere new,
somewhere exciting.

177
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,172
Just the sound of that whistle.

178
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,134
[train whistle blowing]

179
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,469
[train bell ringing]

180
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,138
The wood burner.

181
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,724
Big plume of smoke
coming out through the top.

182
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,269
It never gets old.
It will never get old for me.

183
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,856
You hop on that train set, and boom,

184
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,275
and you just automatically
go right back in time.

185
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,321
It was that old idea of adventure.

186
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,201
That's one of my favorite parts
of the job, actually.

187
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,998
Welcome to Disneyland Railroad roundhouse.

188
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,375
We have four different sets of tracks.

189
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,794
We're standing in front
of locomotive number four.

190
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:14,049
This locomotive was built in 1925
by the Baldwin Locomotive Works company.

191
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,510
And it was brought here
to Disneyland in 1958

192
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,679
and put on the line in 1959.

193
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,517
Part of our rite of passage
when we first joined the railroad

194
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,977
is working night shifts.

195
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:31,024
At the end of the night, we'll have to
polish any of the brass that you see here.

196
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,744
When I was two years old,
probably one of my earliest memories,

197
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,456
my grandfather bought me
a train set for Christmas.

198
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,336
And, of course,
me being the little sneaky kid that I was,

199
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,046
I found it in the closet.

200
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,802
And I remember staring at that train set
for almost a month straight.

201
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,125
And, finally, Christmas came,
and you know, I opened it up,

202
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,893
"Oh, surprise, surprise.
There's a train set."

203
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,813
I still have it to this day.

204
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,065
In high school, I used to sneak out...

205
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,528
get on the Green Line, go to the Blue Line
and go to Union Station

206
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,239
and just study and do my homework
in the terminal.

207
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,325
Used to just sit there
and kinda take it in.

208
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,203
Think about the heyday in the '40s.

209
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,582
And the steam engines that were
coming in and out of that station.

210
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
All aboard!

211
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,631
[Gonzales] Through college,
I was working on cars

212
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,176
and taking apart motors
and anything I could get my hands on.

213
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,888
Naturally, I came here
when I was going to college,

214
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,434
looking to even get a glimpse
of the steam engines.

215
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,271
Now I get to run them
which is a dream come true.

216
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,402
People often say
it all started with a mouse,

217
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,155
but I firmly believe
it all started with a train.

218
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:06,244
Walt was coming out to Los Angeles,
and that's where he drew up Mickey Mouse.

219
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,371
It was on a train that he did that.

220
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,959
Often, he would come out
from his apartment

221
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,170
that's right here on Main Street,

222
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,672
hop on a locomotive and take it away.

223
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,884
Some people didn't even know
they were being pulled by Walt Disney.

224
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,928
He was just, you know,
a big kid playing with his toys.

225
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,931
[train whistle blowing]

226
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,478
Good morning.

227
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,022
It's unbelievable what I get to do,

228
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,525
be it I'm sitting inside the cab
of a locomotive.

229
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:42,614
It's also the people, not only
my coworkers that I get to work with,

230
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,034
which are like-minded
and they're a lot of fun to work with,

231
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,577
but also the guests.

232
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,331
- Make sure you visit Mickey Mouse's house.
- Okay.

233
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,793
It's satisfying everything I ever thought
I would wanna do in life.

234
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,463
It's pretty neat.

235
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,683
I wanted to be
a television news anchorman.

236
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,103
Twenty-five thousand tickets
were sold in advance for the concert

237
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,273
which will feature the Grateful Dead,
the Allman Brothers and The Band...

238
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,693
I aspired to be Walter Cronkite.

239
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,363
I discovered early on that the likelihood
of my being Walter Cronkite...

240
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,032
[chuckling] was pretty, pretty low.

241
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,952
And so I redirected
and ended up in production.

242
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,669
[Brown] <i>These days in New York City...</i>

243
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,922
<i>one of Iger's colleagues
who fulfilled her dream</i>

244
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,590
<i>of getting in front of the camera...</i>

245
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,819
- Morning.
- Good morning, Richie.

246
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,683
- Good morning, Ms. Roberts.
- You're on your best behavior, aren't you?

247
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,640
<i>...wakes up long before dawn
to be ready for work.</i>

248
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,352
[Roberts] I love this job.

249
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,312
- What's up, Elvis?
- Good morning.

250
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,024
I love saying, "Good morning, America."

251
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:04,237
Think about that. I get to set the tone.
We get to set the tone for America.

252
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,489
All right.

253
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,952
The hours, as you saw, going to bed early.

254
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,581
I'm a sports hound and have to go to bed
early and miss some of the late games.

255
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,416
Ah. It's a small sacrifice.

256
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,460
It's gonna be a magical day.

257
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,754
Sal. Getting ready.

258
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,923
- This is teamwork here.
- What up, troops?

259
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,401
- Good morning, Robin.
- Oh, my God.

260
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,927
I mean, I wish the camera
could go all around to see

261
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,097
what it takes to put on a show
like<i> Good Morning America</i>.

262
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,183
- What's up, people?
- Good morning.

263
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,268
Teamwork, discipline, determination.

264
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,356
I took that with me from playing sports.

265
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,649
This is my glam fam.

266
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,987
This is Elena, Petula, D'Andre.

267
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,989
It helped that I worked at ESPN,

268
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,033
that I had this love for sports.

269
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,494
Sports, knew it cold.

270
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,247
I never worked a day in my life at ESPN.
Shh, don't tell anybody that.

271
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,919
We're leading with the terrifying story,
it's the Denver story...

272
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,922
Coming here to ABC,
I loved that it pushed me.

273
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,050
I know. I got an e-mail during the show,
and it was really good.

274
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,302
My knees were knocking under that desk

275
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,305
when I was sitting next to Diane Sawyer
for the first time.

276
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,102
But then the athlete in me came through
in realizing that I had done my homework.

277
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,563
[whispering]
George Stephanopoulos. George.

278
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,482
I had earned the right to be there.

279
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,527
And I'm so grateful for the support staff
that I had to help me.

280
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,363
- <i>One Day at Disney.</i>
- Hi, guys.

281
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,447
[chuckles]

282
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,367
Optimism is a muscle
that gets stronger with use.

283
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,787
I got in the habit at an early age
to be optimistic.

284
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,373
[director] Five, four, three...

285
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,252
I almost feel like
we are a Disney attraction.

286
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,839
Like, people really look forward
to seeing us.

287
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,010
The news is very serious. The information
that we're conveying is very serious,

288
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,971
but there's also a component
of our program

289
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,734
where you can spend time
with the audience.

290
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,475
- [crowd] Good morning!
- How are you?

291
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,812
They've come from all over, not only
the country but all over the world.

292
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,773
- Just got off the airplane.
- Just got off the airplane?

293
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,776
And, boy, are my arms...
And, boy, are my arms tired?

294
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,779
I draw energy from them.

295
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,407
- Nice to have you all here.
- Thank you.

296
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,492
I'm curious. Curiosity.

297
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,328
I never... I never lose sight of that.

298
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,373
I'm always... I'm thirsty for knowledge.

299
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,877
[Brown] <i>So, every story is a chance</i>
<i>to learn something new</i>

300
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,005
<i>and the best ones
offer the chance for even more...</i>

301
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,301
<i>like the call she got
from Washington in 2012.</i>

302
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,056
There's word on the street
that President... then President Obama...

303
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,225
Was going to change his position
on marriage equality.

304
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,730
I was picked to do the interview.

305
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,152
So, I sit down across from the President
of the United States of America,

306
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,611
and I say to him, "Have you changed...

307
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,365
Mr. President, have you changed
your position on marriage equality?"

308
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:58,620
It is important for me
to go ahead and affirm that

309
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,581
I think same-sex couples
should be able to get married.

310
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,252
It was a very special moment
to know that you are part of history,

311
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,588
so I'm feeling pretty good about myself.

312
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,341
We have a producer over to the side
who has little blue cards

313
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,928
with little, you know, time cues
and little notes and everything.

314
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,638
Did you discuss this with...

315
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,057
I think she's gonna say,
"You rock! You're the best!"

316
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,519
It said, "Lipstick on teeth."
So, when I said the statem...

317
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,522
When he made the statement,
I had lipstick on my teeth,

318
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,650
which made me think of my mother's saying,
"When you strut, you stumble."

319
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,069
'Cause I thought I was all that.
I got the big get.

320
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,280
Got the big interview.
"Slow your roll, Robin."

321
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,827
[Brown] <i>The truth was that there was more</i>
<i>on Robin's mind that day anyway.</i>

322
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,373
<i>After overcoming breast cancer
years earlier,</i>

323
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,335
<i>she'd just been told that she had
a rare and serious blood disorder.</i>

324
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,715
I had... [clicks tongue] Wow.

325
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,179
I was at the doctor.
No one knew that I was there.

326
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,599
This was before I did the interview.
It was a day before.

327
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,895
So, after a long, long exam,

328
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,398
basically, a doctor said,

329
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,859
"You're gonna die in a year or two."

330
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,256
So when I'm sitting across from him
and he's making this statement,

331
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,032
and it's making national news,

332
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:22,787
my mind is racing, "Am I going
to even be around long enough to benefit,

333
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,540
as a gay woman, what this man just said?"

334
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:30,003
These two lines here,
so it makes it easier to draw blood

335
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:35,091
and also to administer medication
like the chemo that I'm about to have.

336
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,886
[Brown] <i>She decided to film her battle</i>

337
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,182
<i>and bring millions of ABC viewers
on the journey alongside her.</i>

338
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,729
The fact that I was out of work
for five, six months,

339
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:53,318
when you get a call from the very top
of the company where you're working,

340
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,821
and Bob Iger was one of the first calls
that I received

341
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:02,202
and had his full support, did not have to
worry about my job or anything like that.

342
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:06,164
And I thought about people who go through
something like this, who have to worry.

343
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,000
- Going home now!
- [people cheering]

344
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,039
It's tough enough
you're just fighting for your life.

345
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,799
[Brown] <i>Hope in the face of adversity.</i>

346
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,259
<i>A theme right out of a Disney movie,</i>

347
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,845
<i>and the moral of the story
that Robin Roberts lived.</i>

348
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,685
Everybody's got something.
Everybody's got something.

349
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,437
My mother used to say that
to us all the time

350
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,314
when we were like, "Woe is me. Woe is me."

351
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,566
She was like,
"Honey, everybody's got something."

352
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,947
Something that can be seen as a roadblock,
I used as a hurdle.

353
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,243
Yes, you are. That's what I love
about the morning, you never know.

354
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,540
[applause]

355
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,792
I didn't go through all this
just to hang around.

356
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,127
A minute 30.

357
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,630
That's why I say I'm a thriver,
not a survivor.

358
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,968
[male announcer] I would like
to thank Robin Roberts for being here.

359
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,555
[audience cheering, applause]

360
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,145
I was at <i>ABC Sports</i> for 13 years.

361
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,984
When I moved from sports to entertainment,

362
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,362
you know, they were both similar in that

363
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,948
the most important thing
about entertainment,

364
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,285
whether it was ABC or anywhere,
was essentially telling a great story.

365
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,291
[Brown] <i>After a long rise up the ranks</i>
<i>of ABC and then Disney...</i>

366
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:37,088
<i>Bob Iger was promoted to CEO
of the company in 2005.</i>

367
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:42,844
If you look at Disney's storytelling,
the quality of optimism exists

368
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,805
in almost every major story
that's been told by this company.

369
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,644
<i>One of the artists tasked
with bringing these stories to life</i>

370
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,855
<i>is Pixar's Jerome Ranft.</i>

371
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,859
<i>While Pixar is known
for computer animation...</i>

372
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,156
<i>every day at its headquarters,
Jerome does things the old-fashioned way,</i>

373
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,200
<i>with his hands.</i>

374
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:10,955
It's subconscious and innate.
I just love to make stuff.

375
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,963
Being a sculptor just fulfilled that need.

376
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:24,052
I almost feel like it found me,
like, I had this desire.

377
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,391
And I took my first sculpting class
when I got into college.

378
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,311
The first project
was a life-sized self-portrait.

379
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:37,857
And as soon as I finished that,
I was like, "This is what I'm gonna do."

380
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,796
[Brown] <i>Jerome's passion</i>
<i>has brought to life characters</i>

381
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,030
<i>such as Mike and Sully from</i> Monsters, Inc.

382
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,242
<i>And even a fish called Nemo.</i>

383
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,706
I usually get brought on
when they wanna start fleshing out

384
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,375
what these characters
will look like three-dimensionally.

385
00:22:55,917 --> 00:23:00,463
And mostly what I do
is pre-visualize 3-D design

386
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,299
before they spend the time and money
to develop it in a computer.

387
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,676
This one.

388
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,678
You're part of that group of people

389
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,432
trying to solve aesthetic problems
and make aesthetic decisions

390
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,852
that help make these things
become finished projects.

391
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:18,231
I think Waternoose
from<i> Monsters, Incorporated...</i>

392
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,941
I was very happy with that.

393
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,029
It was very, very complicated.
Very, very challenging piece.

394
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:27,157
I'm never asked
to do the same thing twice.

395
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,662
I've done three <i>Cars</i> films
and not one of them was like the other.

396
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:38,168
This was during the production of <i>Cars 3</i>
early, early, early on.

397
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,131
At one point McQueen
was gonna try to be in disguise,

398
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:47,844
so whatever disguise we did
had to fit over this sort of chassis.

399
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,347
And this was the disguise.

400
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,639
This story point changed

401
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:55,477
and this whole exercise
of making this sculpture became moot,

402
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,147
but, at the time,
this was what this was being used for.

403
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,275
It's not so much pride.
I feel humble, the fact

404
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,945
that this character's that's owned
by the world now, by you know...

405
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,782
Millions of children
have grown up with this character.

406
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,825
At one point, he was a drawing,

407
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,037
and it went in through my eyes
and out through my hands.

408
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,333
My brother was working at Disney
when I was in junior high school,

409
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:23,088
so I used to... I remember going
and visiting him at the Disney lot

410
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:26,758
and being completely blown away
by these projects.

411
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:30,637
He says, "You heard him, code red.
Repeat, we are at code red!"

412
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:35,266
[Brown] <i>Jerome's brother, Joe,</i>
<i>was a legendary Disney and Pixar animator,</i>

413
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,229
<i>who worked for decades
on the company's biggest movies</i>

414
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,980
<i>including some with his brother.</i>

415
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:47,821
Being able to work with him on any project
was, sort of, a dream come true.

416
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,365
...see it, and he's like, "Ahhh!"
and he starts...

417
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,284
I didn't realize how special it was
until he had passed.

418
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,331
[Brown] <i>Joe died</i>
<i>in a car accident in 2005.</i>

419
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,543
<i>He was just 45 years old.</i>

420
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,880
When he first passed away
and I walked into this building,

421
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,342
it was really hard, and I was questioning
whether I could do it.

422
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,473
He wouldn't have wanted that.

423
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:21,938
I have my own career and my own
set of standards that I do this work to,

424
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:26,818
and I think that's what my parents
taught us both.

425
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,949
He influenced me in ways
I'm still sort of figuring out.

426
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,454
I just miss him. I wish he was here.

427
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,336
[Brown] <i>Jerome's continued to grow</i>
<i>his family's legacy at Disney...</i>

428
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,174
<i>but there are fewer and fewer sculptors
working in animation today.</i>

429
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:54,012
The role I've played here is changing.

430
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,889
In the early days,

431
00:25:56,848 --> 00:26:00,643
the digital modelers they had here
came from a computer background,

432
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:04,689
and now they're training artists
to use the tool of the computer.

433
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:08,651
And there's incredibly talented
digital modelers

434
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,029
out there in the world
and especially here.

435
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,574
I wanna be a better sculptor.

436
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,244
That's never gonna... That...
How can I even put it?

437
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:22,123
The impulse to be better at what I do
is never ever gonna go away.

438
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,171
What this company is, more than anything,

439
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,799
aside from a collection
of many talented people

440
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,592
and the legacy of Walt Disney,

441
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,844
is a... is a great partnership...

442
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,599
between artists and technologists.

443
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:44,270
Jake definitely has his own personality
and you can't help but love him.

444
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:48,024
When you get to meet him, and see him,
and he's happy to see you,

445
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,484
it's a great feeling.

446
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:56,366
He's a maintenance droid.
He loves his job. He's very dedicated.

447
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,203
Jake doesn't talk,
so he's more like R2-D2.

448
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:03,623
He uses sounds and colors
and lights to communicate.

449
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,250
He's got an eye.

450
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,631
Yellow, he's happy. Blue, he's sad.
Red, he's angry.

451
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,758
Gray is, "Please, leave me alone."

452
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,760
[laughs]

453
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,929
So, how are you feeling
about the design, Tanner?

454
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,973
[Brown] <i>Ashley Girdich works</i>
<i>in California...</i>

455
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,975
It's looking pretty good.
Ready for the field.

456
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,703
Okay. Is there anything
we can do while we're...

457
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,896
<i>as a member of Walt Disney
Imagineering Research and Development...</i>

458
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,901
<i>where she takes her knowledge of
technology to create extraordinary ways</i>

459
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:34,904
<i>for guests to interact

460
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,408
The day that he went live outdoors,

461
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,745
I was jumping, screaming, laughing.

462
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,332
Having a character roaming around freely,

463
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,792
people were blown away.

464
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,129
Everyone was trying to find
how he was being controlled.

465
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:54,799
He was his own character,
without a puppeteer in the background.

466
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,804
I think the unreasonable ideas are
the ones we get the most excited about.

467
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,850
Things that we think
are impossible or outlandish,

468
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,394
we do whatever we can to make that happen.

469
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:10,732
All of the operations partners I've
talked to, that is a good time for them...

470
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:14,569
I think one of the biggest challenges
is the reputation this company has.

471
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:16,780
You've gotta be top of your game.

472
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:21,451
We don't just go out and build a robot
and say, "Now, what can you do with it?"

473
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,579
I take a character and say,
"Can I make this character come to life?"

474
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,497
[people chattering]

475
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,380
- [Girdich] Come in the front.
- [droid beeps]

476
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,126
When we were play-testing
Jake in the park,

477
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,838
we had a couple of children
who would put their hands on his shoulder

478
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,674
and just walk right alongside him.

479
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,221
They see him as their friend
and immediately take to him.

480
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,182
Kids would come up
and just give him a hug.

481
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:48,019
Sit, wrap their arms around him.
They would give him a kiss.

482
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,623
- [child] Hold me!
- [Girdich] And you realize the power

483
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,899
that these characters have
to inspire wonder.

484
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:53,983
Hi.

485
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,611
- [chuckles]
- [droid beeping]

486
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,824
We're constantly updating him.

487
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:04,411
And right now, what we're trying to do
is refactor some of his code

488
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,372
so that he can work a little bit better
than he has in the past.

489
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,251
More responsive, more reliable.

490
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,420
I want him to last forever.

491
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,133
You have to be resilient to try
and introduce new things into the park

492
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,677
and find ways to solve challenges.

493
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:27,934
We would love to have our characters speak
what we call natural language processing.

494
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,937
In the technology terms,
it's still very difficult,

495
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,857
and especially
in a theme park environment.

496
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,735
Very interesting challenge.

497
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,404
So, we'll see, we'll see.

498
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,822
[chuckles] We're working on it.

499
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,578
My dream would be
to reintroduce some of our characters

500
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,164
the way they are on the screen,
straight into our parks.

501
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,250
Dreams are incredibly important, I think,

502
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:55,462
because they can unify us
to go after something

503
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,423
that, alone,
we might have not been able to do.

504
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,551
Living out your dreams
in the way that our guests do in the park

505
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,636
really is a different way of saying,

506
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,474
"I can create something I never thought
could exist in the physical world."

507
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,160
[woman] Ellen,
you're not seeing the droid.

508
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,537
[Girdich] When you think about
what the outcome is of your work,

509
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:14,606
it's millions of faces smiling.

510
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,107
I love this guy.

511
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,911
It's a great reason
to get up every morning.

512
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,412
Usually when I'm just drawing,

513
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,956
it really comes from a feeling inside.

514
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,167
It kinda just flows out of my hand.

515
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,795
It's an emotion that I'm trying
to put down on paper.

516
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:43,093
Some of the favorite things
that I like to draw is my nephews.

517
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:46,513
I have all these great memories with them
and experiences with them.

518
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,557
I hear them laugh,
and I hear how they play with each other.

519
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,185
And that's kind of where my hand goes.

520
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:57,065
My parents came from Taiwan.
My dad came here first in his early 20s,

521
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,651
on a business trip,
and he fell in love with the country.

522
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,987
And so, he went back to Taiwan,
and then brought me and my mom.

523
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:06,449
I definitely grew up as a Disney child.

524
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,953
I remember having one Disney book,
and it was in Chinese,

525
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:13,164
but it was all Disney characters,
and my mom would read that to me.

526
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,001
And so even though
we didn't really recognize the reading,

527
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,336
like the pictures told the story.

528
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,839
And so we always had
a fondness for images.

529
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,930
I started working in animation,
and I was actually at a fork in the road

530
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:31,933
because I was thinking maybe
I would go into teaching

531
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,435
because I love working with kids,

532
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:36,354
and I thought it would be great
to bring art into education.

533
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,065
But as I was preparing for school,

534
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:42,527
I also just applied all over,
Disney included.

535
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,365
And I remember I got accepted
to all the schools I applied for,

536
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:51,327
but then I got a call from Disney,
and it was just no question.

537
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:54,456
Like, I was... I wanted to work at Disney.

538
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,542
As a senior illustration manager here,

539
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:02,297
I work with a team of artists
and provide them art direction,

540
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,549
make sure everything's in line.

541
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,843
We take the art direction of the film,

542
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:12,182
and we create a style of our own
for the books.

543
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:15,894
The first picture book
that I worked on here was <i>Sofia the First.</i>

544
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,521
I really like this book
because I got to add,

545
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:22,734
like, little flourish designs throughout
the book to wrap around the text.

546
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:26,529
And it was really fun to be able
to add the little hearts on the I's.

547
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,740
And it felt more personal.

548
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,659
It's something that I think,
as a child, I would have done too.

549
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:38,458
I work with the most creative people
that I know.

550
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,169
So, we have the <i>Frozen</i> middle grade cover.

551
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:45,173
And then, Winnie and I have been talking
about special effects.

552
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,801
When a film is in production,

553
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:50,887
we start illustrating the books
that go along with the films.

554
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:55,725
We're thinking, like, a burgundy color
that will match Anna's lining.

555
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:00,605
So, it's got a very <i>Frozen 2</i> color,
so all the palettes are cohesive.

556
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,857
There's books that retell the film,

557
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,527
and then there's also books
that are extension stories.

558
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,072
And as a manager,
I guide the team of artists

559
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,575
so that they can illustrate a book
that looks cohesive,

560
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,494
even though
there are multiple hands on it.

561
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,956
So, this is for the <i>Toy Story 4</i>
extension book. And...

562
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,167
One of the things that I really like
working on is extension stories

563
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:24,629
because you get to extend
the life of these characters

564
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:27,132
that you fall in love with
when you watch the movie.

565
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:30,635
Especially, like, when I was younger,
and I would watch this film,

566
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,680
and I would always wonder,
"Oh, what happens after they get married?"

567
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,016
Or "What happens
after this adventure's over?"

568
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:41,187
We get this foundation to work with,
but we get to take in so many directions.

569
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,522
Yeah, the book is really fun.

570
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:47,027
And it takes place in a carnival setting,
so it's actually really appropriate.

571
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,653
I think these extension stories

572
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:52,198
develop this new type of relationship
I have with the characters.

573
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:56,161
You experience them even in a closer way

574
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:59,122
because we get to tell,
like, what happens next.

575
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,834
I'm helping Jeff with the <i>Frozen 2</i> covers.

576
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:08,381
One of my favorite parts of the job is
we get to collaborate with the filmmakers.

577
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,135
They're the ones that create
this world and these people.

578
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:17,599
And to have this firsthand explanation
of all this knowledge

579
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:21,436
is what helps us
make our books so wonderful.

580
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,899
And we had decided on a cool silver ink,
so it'll be shimmery.

581
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,734
And so it will stand out from the page.

582
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:31,196
You have everything working
in a more analogous color scheme,

583
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,323
which is a more limited scheme,

584
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:36,034
but it's much more harmonious
to the environment.

585
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:39,120
You immediately recognize them
as Anna and Elsa.

586
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:42,665
I think it channels the <i>Frozen</i> aesthetic
quite a bit.

587
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:49,589
So another one of my favorite books
was <i>Three Little Words</i>.

588
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:54,719
I really love the message of this book,
and it's to just keep swimming.

589
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,639
I think it's a great, positive message
for little kids,

590
00:34:57,722 --> 00:35:00,517
and it's also something
that I tell myself every day.

591
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,979
What I love about art is
it forces me to find my voice.

592
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,441
It allows me a way to express myself.

593
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,527
And I've learned to love myself

594
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,447
because I learned that everyone
expresses themselves differently.

595
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,577
[Brown] <i>For the artists, and the audience,</i>

596
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,623
<i>Disney creations are ways to connect
with the magic of stories.</i>

597
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,794
<i>And for the man who oversees it all,</i>

598
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,297
<i>there's nothing more satisfying
than seeing the biggest,</i>

599
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:35,719
<i>most ambitious creations come to life
in almost unfathomable ways.</i>

600
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:41,433
[Iger] When you can not only experience
the story but live with the story...

601
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:45,603
that's a very, very powerful experience
to have.

602
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:57,449
<i>And it immediately thrilled visitors
when it opened the summer of 2019</i>

603
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,577
<i>at both Disneyland and Disney World.</i>

604
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,389
[Baker]
Grand openings are always hard for me

605
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:07,417
because you're giving a huge piece of your
heart to the world for the first time.

606
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:12,464
It's hard to turn it over that first time
and to see how the world's gonna react

607
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,187
because you don't know till they come in.

608
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:20,221
The fans of <i>Star Wars</i> have been
building <i>Star Wars</i> for 45 years now.

609
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,184
There's people that live and breathe
<i>Star Wars</i> every day,

610
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:26,186
and this land that we've built

611
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:30,148
now gives them a place
to live their <i>Star Wars</i> story.

612
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:36,571
I feel we owe them, to give them the best
possible experience they can have.

613
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:39,574
'Cause this is something that, you know,

614
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,951
they've waited their entire lives
to see this.

615
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,539
[Brown] <i>And so,</i>
<i>as Disney planned Galaxy's Edge,</i>

616
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,833
<i>Eric Baker traveled around the world...</i>

617
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,378
<i>hunting and collecting props</i>

618
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:54,631
<i>that would convince the most</i>
<i>knowledgeable</i> Star Wars <i>fanatics...</i>

619
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,344
<i>that every detail in the park
was just right.</i>

620
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:06,309
[Baker] They're getting the thrill
of a totally immersive world

621
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,436
that they're experiencing
for the first time.

622
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:12,357
This is the first time that we're really
putting it in front of guests' faces.

623
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,277
I mean, to be able to go 360
around something

624
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:19,698
and really look at it and study it,
"There's that and there's that."

625
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:23,702
And seeing all these pieces they've seen
in the films for years and years.

626
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,914
I mean, there's nothing like seeing
the reaction on the guest's face

627
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:30,875
the very first time that they walk
into anything that we've done.

628
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:36,631
It makes every minute of blood, sweat
and tears we put into this worth it.

629
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,135
Um... Sorry.

630
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,929
[chuckles] I get choked up.
I'm sorry. I'm emotional.

631
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,810
I mean, just in this little shop alone,

632
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:53,148
um, there's over 63 cages
hanging from the ceiling.

633
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:55,358
And all these cages
are made out of different things.

634
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:59,529
I mean, some of them, actually, are made
out of studio lights from film sets.

635
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:02,157
It's an incredible, beautiful mess.

636
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,244
I grew up in a very small town
in North Georgia.

637
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:09,998
We didn't even have a theater. You had
to go to the next town to go to a movie,

638
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,042
so if you went to a movie,
it was a special event.

639
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,170
I didn't see <i>Star Wars</i> till it had been
in the theater for about a year.

640
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:18,214
I finally got my parents to take me,
and it had changed my life.

641
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,799
I didn't know what I wanted to do,

642
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:22,093
but I knew I wanted to be
in the entertainment industry.

643
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,599
Funny enough, I was at a party one night,

644
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:31,770
and there was a prop master
from a TV show who showed up at the party

645
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,230
and saw some of the stuff
that I had built around my house.

646
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:38,109
And asked me if I was interested
in being a prop fabricator.

647
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,339
Going from film into the real world
was building stuff

648
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:44,616
that's gonna last
for the guests to enjoy every day.

649
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:47,595
When you build it for a film set, it's
something that has to last one or two days

650
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:48,912
and then it gets thrown out.

651
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:52,749
When we were in England, we would go
to aircraft scrapyards and stuff

652
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,959
because we were actually shopping
for aircraft parts

653
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,003
to match stuff that was used in the films.

654
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:59,756
And suddenly, there's a 747
sitting in a cow pasture

655
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,383
that they're tearing the parts off of.

656
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:05,178
And you would go in and say,
"I'll take all 57 miles of cable

657
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,556
and that seat and that seat
and that control panel." [chuckles]

658
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,453
When a stormtrooper takes off his helmet,

659
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:15,730
does he hang it on a coat rack,
or does he have a stand he puts it on?

660
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,483
Part of the fun for us was coming up
with these things

661
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,151
that hadn't been seen on camera,

662
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:24,072
and getting to add to this lore
that we've loved our whole lives.

663
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:28,076
My grandson thinks I'm famous now.
[laughs]

664
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:32,789
He's like, "You're famous."
I'm like, "No, I'm not. Not really.

665
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,708
I just make this stuff, you know."

666
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:40,463
I told my wife the bucket list
is checked off now,

667
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:41,881
to work on <i>Star Wars</i>. [chuckles]

668
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:43,800
I'm getting chills talking about it.

669
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:54,978
[Iger] If Walt could see
the company today,

670
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:59,566
I believe that
he would be extremely proud of,

671
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:03,319
not only the fact
that his legacy is still alive

672
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,906
and that the values that he infused
in his stories still exist,

673
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:10,910
but that we've, in many respects,
followed his footsteps,

674
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:14,914
which is to keep taking risks and chances
and exploring new ground.

675
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,210
[Brown] <i>The company covered new ground</i>

676
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:22,839
<i>when Disney's Animal Kingdom
opened in Orlando in 1998.</i>

677
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:27,260
<i>Today, the park is thriving
as much as ever...</i>

678
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,015
<i>thanks to a special brand of TLC
behind the scenes.</i>

679
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,561
[Mylniczenko]
Peri is a prehensile-tailed porcupine.

680
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:40,690
She's been trained to allow us
to do ultrasounds on her.

681
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:46,654
Giving us an opportunity to track
her pregnancy from conception until birth.

682
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:50,742
That way we could tell that she
was healthy, that the baby was healthy.

683
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:56,831
So, when there's a fetus,
it makes it a lot easier to see.

684
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:00,627
And right now, we're just been able
to see her urinary bladder.

685
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,088
And then you can see a hint
of her uterus popping in.

686
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,839
Now we're just doing checkups on her,

687
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:08,551
but we're also going to be preparing
for a second pregnancy.

688
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:19,437
Ever since I've been a small child,

689
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:22,857
I've just tried to help animals
and help heal them.

690
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:26,611
And so that's just been
an innate part of my growing up.

691
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:32,742
So far...

692
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:35,787
There we go.

693
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,959
I came here for a visit
during a vet conference,

694
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,712
and I was just impressed.

695
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,338
I loved the facilities.

696
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:49,551
I loved the opportunity
to care for the animals as well.

697
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:54,681
As I got to know all of the veterinarians,
I just thought it was an amazing team.

698
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:59,644
And because of all of that,
I was really enticed to come here.

699
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:03,231
I think that's what I love most.

700
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:07,694
We have a diversity of animals,
both terrestrial and aquatic.

701
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:09,362
It allows people to really get close.

702
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:12,282
It allows people
to understand the animals,

703
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:16,494
and it gives them an opportunity
to care and bond with those animals.

704
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:20,665
We have folks that come up here regularly

705
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:24,127
that... know all of the different animals.

706
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:29,049
Like the gorillas. There are some people
that know all of the gorillas by name.

707
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:31,509
And the guests will just visit them,

708
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:34,429
which is a unique opportunity.

709
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:39,809
We do routine examinations
on many of our animals.

710
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:42,520
And today we did an examination
on a southern stingray.

711
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:46,024
- ...at 950, so we got a good mark on her.
- Perfect.

712
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:49,986
This is a female that's been with us.
Her name is Dexy.

713
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,199
PH is 8.6.

714
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:57,494
So, right now we're measuring
the oxygen level

715
00:42:57,577 --> 00:43:01,373
of the... area that she's in.

716
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,583
Today she's getting her routine exam.

717
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,211
And so, because of that,
we need to do a little bit more.

718
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,338
Let's go ahead and look at her gills.

719
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:15,095
So, her cardiac contractions are great.
Her rhythm and rate are great.

720
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:16,930
So, I have no concerns right now.

721
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:18,973
We took an ultrasound as well,

722
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:22,268
which gives me an excellent view
of all of her organs

723
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:25,480
so I can determine health of her,
you know, from the inside.

724
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:27,440
Yeah, it feels like it's actually healed.

725
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:31,986
A typical day can mean anything
from doing a pregnancy exam on a scorpion,

726
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:36,408
to a bird gets an injury
in one of our aviaries.

727
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:39,703
You do have to get quite creative.

728
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,455
Every day we have to figure out

729
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:46,793
how to put a bandage on an animal
that wouldn't normally have a bandage.

730
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,713
So, how would you put a bandage on a fish?

731
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:53,550
Or a very tiny bird that has a broken leg?
How do you fix that broken leg?

732
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:57,971
And so you come up with toothpicks
and tape, sometimes, to make splints.

733
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:04,978
And then the conservation piece.
Disney really cares about conservation.

734
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:09,733
All of us have an opportunity to work
with conservation that Disney supports.

735
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:13,862
I'm particularly interested
in working with gorillas

736
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:18,491
in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
with a program called GRACE.

737
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:22,495
And that's the Gorilla Rehabilitation
and Conservation Education Center

738
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:25,498
that cares for orphaned gorillas.

739
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:30,211
We can then have those gorillas
rehabilitated,

740
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:33,173
and then placed
into a family group of gorillas,

741
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:34,591
with the ultimate goal

742
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:37,052
of reintroducing them
to a safe environment.

743
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,531
- [Mylniczenko] What do you think?
- [keeper] Probably.

744
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:43,183
- [Mylniczenko] Okay.
- [keeper] I could leave it right there.

745
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,810
- Does that work?
- [Mylniczenko] That can work.

746
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:50,148
All of our animals have bitey parts
and scratchy parts. [chuckles]

747
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:55,153
Yeah, there are times when you just need
to make sure you understand the animal.

748
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:58,281
But we also have keeper staff
that really know the animals well

749
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,867
and can help us with safety issues.

750
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,327
Oh, yeah.

751
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:05,455
Good job.

752
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:06,831
They choose. Right?

753
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:09,793
They can make the decisions
to come and participate if their...

754
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:12,921
With their medical care
or they can choose to go.

755
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:14,964
Hey, girl.

756
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:17,943
- [Mylniczenko] What a good job.
- [keeper] Good girl. That's very nice.

757
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:22,931
Sometimes what we do is really amazing.
We get to see animals through birth.

758
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:25,725
- [Mylniczenko] What a good girl.
- [keeper] Good girl. Good girl.

759
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:30,522
She's doing such a good job.

760
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:35,402
We get to see them overcome issues,
and those are amazing things.

761
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,572
Being a veterinarian is probably one of,

762
00:45:39,656 --> 00:45:41,574
in my opinion, [chuckles]

763
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:43,910
the most rewarding jobs you can have.

764
00:45:43,993 --> 00:45:47,372
Sweetie. It's just for you. I know.
It's just for you. Yummies.

765
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:49,457
[Iger] We're all, in many ways, in the...

766
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,210
Not only in the same business
but doing the same thing,

767
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,587
which is trying to reach people
all over the world

768
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:57,257
in very compelling ways,
trying to touch people's hearts.

<i>propelled by the gifts
of some amazing performers.</i>

774
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:19,112
Every start of the show gives me
a different vibe, a different energy.

775
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:21,865
- Testing, testing, testing, testing.
- All good.

776
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:24,826
That first call means a lot

777
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:28,329
'cause you find
the public members screaming.

778
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:31,624
[audience cheering, applause]

779
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:36,254
But the minute you start that call,
it's like total <i>silencio.</i> And then, boom.

780
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,839
[applauding continues]

781
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:39,466
I have their eyes on me.

[background singers singing in Zulu]

784
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,773
I still get chills when I'm...
[chuckling] singing.

785
00:46:58,276 --> 00:46:59,986
Especially the first song.

786
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,239
I just don't get over with
that first song, "The Circle of Life."

787
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,742
[continues singing in Zulu]

788
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:10,455
I look at individuals amongst the public.

789
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:14,584
And the connection I feel with their eyes,
even better when they are crying.

790
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:15,794
I'm like, "Oof."

791
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:16,878
[chuckles]

792
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:17,962
"I feel you."

793
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:22,050
I'm really proud.
It's a very special role.

794
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:25,595
I feel honored that I was trusted.

795
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:31,059
[Brown] <i>Zama's journey to Madrid</i>
<i>began years ago in South Africa...</i>

796
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:36,231
<i>where she grew up dreaming
bigger and bigger with every song.</i>

797
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:40,193
[Magudulela] I think I was about five.
I actually composed a song.

798
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:41,996
That's how much I knew
that I loved singing.

799
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:45,657
And then, of course, at nine years, that's
when I'm like, "I think I love singing."

800
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,411
'Cause I ended up copying my friend
who sang better than me at that point.

801
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:53,790
She can sing, I can try and sing too.
I'm going to be competitive.

802
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:56,751
I just sang and sang until I upstaged her.

803
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:58,253

<i>to support her friend at a casting call.</i>

805

<i>She caught the eye of the director,

806

[Magudulela] My first audition

At that point I just finished
my first musical in South Africa.

808

There was a long queue, and I asked
people, "Okay, what is this queue for?"

809

"It's, like, auditions, <i>Lion King</i>."
I'm like, "What is that?"

I went to the movie store,
bought myself that DVD.

811
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,084
I thought, "If I do <i>The Lion King</i>,
am I gonna be a cartoon?" [chuckles]

812
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,254
[Brown] <i>Four days later,</i>
<i>she was offered the part of Rafiki...</i>

813
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,258
<i>despite having
no acting experience at all.</i>

814
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:49,971
I do have moments
where I'm actually meditating.

815
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,014
[chuckles]

816
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:52,307
I close my eyes.

817
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,600
[chuckles]

818
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:55,560
- Clearing the mind.
- You know?

819
00:48:56,102 --> 00:48:58,772
I'm glad and grateful
that I've been part of this journey.

820
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:00,940
<i>Soy listo!</i>

821
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:05,445
Being around this show teaches me
every day to be a better person.

822
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:11,910
[singing in Zulu]

823
00:49:11,993 --> 00:49:14,329
I mean, all the songs for me are special.

824
00:49:14,412 --> 00:49:16,289
They tell a certain story.

825
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:21,920
And... for me, "The Circle of Life,"
I just connect with it.

826
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:24,506
♪ <i>It's the circle of life</i> ♪

827
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:26,841
It's like, "Wow,
we're so connected on this earth."

828
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,261
We need each other.

829
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:35,100
Ooh... [sighs]
It's just too much. It's deep.

830
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:36,183
[chuckles]

831
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:39,020
[singing in Spanish]

832
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:43,274
I just connect with it
as when I came on this earth.

833
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:46,444
How my family was happy.

834
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,822
And what dramas or what problems
we've been through.

835
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:51,825
[continues singing in Spanish]

836
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:54,869
My parents are no longer there.

837
00:49:56,871 --> 00:50:01,543
I always feel they are still with me
when I'm delivering this song.

838
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,212
Because, really,
when I talk to that Mufasa,

839
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:07,298
I'm not talking to Mufasa,
I'm talking to my parents.

840
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,136
That's why I'm grateful
to be part of this journey

841
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,888
because, really,
I've changed so many people's lives.

842
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:17,475
You know, knowing that there could be
people who are coming here sad.

843
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,896
When we perform, then they leave happy.

844
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:26,192
It's an amazing reaction.
I feel like we're giving them a gift.

845
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:30,321
It just makes me [chuckles] feel blessed.

846
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:47,714
[Iger] The Walt Disney Company
is almost a hundred years old.

847
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:52,052
And it's pretty extraordinary
when you think about a company

848
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:54,429
that's been around as long as ours

849
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:58,224
that is still extremely relevant
in the world, that, in many respects,

850
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:01,311
doesn't look anything like the world
that existed back in 1923

851
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:04,481
when Walt and his brother Roy
started the company.

852
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,987
[Brown] <i>Another company that's withstood</i>
<i>the test of time is Marvel,</i>

853
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:15,450
<i>which Bob Iger added
to Disney's portfolio in 2009.</i>

854
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:23,333
<i>Just like Bob Iger,
Ryan Meinerding works in Los Angeles.</i>

855
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:26,378
<i>He got his start on </i>Iron Man...

856
00:51:27,545 --> 00:51:31,299
<i>and has since risen to the head
of Visual Development at Marvel Studios.</i>

857
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,095
<i>Ryan creates the first visuals</i>

858
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:37,889
<i>that ultimately inspire
the characters' costumes.</i>

859
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:44,020
One of the reasons I love movies is going
on that journey the hero's going on

860
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,523
and trying to create the visual
for that character

861
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:49,025
that's going to lock in
the audience's empathy

862
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:51,361
and take them forward
through the journey of the film

863
00:51:51,444 --> 00:51:54,364
is something that I, you know,
I'm always going to pick the heroes.

864
00:51:56,866 --> 00:52:00,662
Marvel superheroes are powerful, not only
because they literally have powers

865
00:52:00,745 --> 00:52:02,706
but also because they have lots of flaws.

866
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:06,835
Spider-Man and Peter Parker are relatable
because he has real-world problems.

867
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:09,254
He, you know,
has problems with girlfriends.

868
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:12,215
He has problems with his Aunt May.
He has problems in school.

869
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:16,761
I pitched the idea of having
Spider-Man's eyes be emotive.

870
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:19,472
They would move
and essentially be able to understand

871
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:22,225
what Peter is thinking
under the suit through his eyes.

872
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,853
And that was one of the things
that I'm most proud about,

873
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:26,730
having solved here at Marvel.

874
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:29,917
That's one of the best parts
of working on this job too

875
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:32,193
is just working from those great icons.

876
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:36,990
I was trying to think of different ways
for Thanos to attack Doctor Strange.

877
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:40,452
I was thinking,
maybe he could destroy planets or...

878
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:43,955
A lot of us that work here in the Visual
Development department are fans.

879
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:47,250
And just make it come through
like portals or comets or whatever.

880
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,835
Just raining down on Doctor Strange.

881
00:52:48,918 --> 00:52:51,689
[Meinerding] A lot of what the characters
are about are sort of ingrained in us.

882
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:55,133
Being passionate about finding
new ways of representing them

883
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:57,969
- in a storytelling context...
- I think they're really great.

884
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,721
...just keeps driving me forward.

885
00:53:00,263 --> 00:53:02,283
If I could talk to
the 13-year-old version of myself

886
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:06,394
and tell him what I'm working on today,
I don't think that he would believe me.

887
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:10,607
Having worked on a character
like Captain America or Iron Man...

888
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:12,692
people love them.

889
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:15,904
And if you do justice by that character,

890
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:18,782
people will continue to love them,
and I'm excited by that.

891
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:21,385
I loved these characters
from when I was very young.

892
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:25,246
I started buying comics,
probably when I was ten or 11.

893
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:30,335
And then all through the '90s, I was
reading comics when I was a teenager.

894
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:33,254
So, I started pretty, pretty young
with the characters

895
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:37,008
and I've, sort of, been fortunate enough
to end up with a job

896
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:41,721
that really allows me
to play into my fanboy tendencies.

897
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:46,393
It used to be that a person like me
would be doing pencil drawings

898
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,716
that would need to be approved
before something got made.

899
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,772
[Stegon] The final pose
that we're interested in,

900
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:54,651
some of the initial pose wasn't dy...
Quite dynamic enough.

901
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:57,487
He feels too stiff.
Maybe he doesn't feel menacing enough.

902
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,157
Because he's a very powerful character,
so he needs to feel powerful.

903
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,370
It's using computers
and being able to get high resolution,

904
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:06,705
more finished images.

905
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,468
We're able to actually
accomplish something

906
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:12,002
that's as close
to the finished thing as possible.

907
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:15,505
All together, it probably took
about 30 or 40 versions.

908
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:17,799
And the main purpose of that
was to, essentially,

909
00:54:17,882 --> 00:54:21,011
put it into a 3-D maquette,
that was gonna be 3-D printed,

910
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:24,055
as a final sign-off
for the directors and the producers

911
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:26,808
to see the character,
and you know, be able to walk around it.

912
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:32,480
We're working on around three films a year
and adding more projects to that as we go.

913
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,191
Finding ways of accomplishing that,

914
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:38,445
both from an artistic standpoint
of actually solving problems,

915
00:54:38,528 --> 00:54:39,738
design problems, artistically,

916
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:45,452
also working with my team to art direct
and help them solve problems as well.

917
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:48,455
And working with visual effects
and the costume departments

918
00:54:48,538 --> 00:54:54,127
to really take our designs and help them
get resolved in a really amazing way

919
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,547
is enough to keep me busy
through the whole week

920
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,190
and into the weekends and... [chuckles]

921
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,179
As an artist, there's also just a sense of
wanting to do better than the last time.

922
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:07,015
Every artist wants to keep growing.

923
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:11,186
We're always having new chances
to reinterpret the characters.

924
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:12,896
We're having new places for them to go

925
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:15,565
with the stories the filmmakers
are coming up with.

926
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:19,361
And we're really getting the chance
to push ourselves.

927
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:23,782
This is the Captain America hero costume
from <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>.

928
00:55:23,865 --> 00:55:26,868
It's, sort of,
his culmination in that film

929
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:30,663
for blending,
being a symbol and being a soldier.

930
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:35,418
It was also the first time I was trying
to incorporate the stripes as straps,

931
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:38,296
turning them in, pulling them off of it,
just being on the costume.

932
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,508
And turning them into something that
was part of the utility of the costume.

933
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:46,805
So, to transition from the World War II
aesthetic to the end of Cap's journey,

934
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:50,308
so he's already had, I don't know,
probably six costumes

935
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:54,062
in between this and <i>The First Avenger</i>
costume and this one.

936
00:55:54,145 --> 00:55:57,732
One of the challenges we had on this suit
was really making these scales work.

937
00:55:58,316 --> 00:56:00,985
A lot of my job
is hopefully inspiring people,

938
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,446
but it's also just letting people
solve problems.

939
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:09,536
We did a whole bunch of iterations where
it would look perfectly fine in the front.

940
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:12,706
But the moment that, you know,
you would go into a three-quarter view,

941
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:16,084
those lines started to diminish
and not look as great.

942
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:20,922
One of the things as an artist is failure
comes as a fear with every brushstroke.

943
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:23,341
- Yeah, straight lines on a compound curve.
- Yep.

944
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:24,259
[both laugh]

945
00:56:24,342 --> 00:56:26,654
You're starting from a blank page
and you're building it up.

946
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:30,807
And a lot of times, you'll take a misstep.
You'll go the wrong direction...

947
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,642
There's, like, an odd banding shape.

948
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:34,954
[Meinerding]
...and have to course correct.

949
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:39,190
So, I sort of deal with failure
at every moment, I feel, of every day.

950
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:41,836
When you see it on screen you just say,
"Oh, cool, he's wearing the scales."

951
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,839
But the amount of engineering and artistry
that goes into making these things

952
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:46,448
really come to fruition is incredible.

953
00:56:46,531 --> 00:56:48,450
I had hoped it would look very good,

954
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:50,785
and it turned out better
than I could have ever expected.

955
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:54,497
Every part of this ride has felt like,

956
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,375
it can't get bigger,
it can't get more amazing.

957
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:01,963
And somehow the filmmakers and
Marvel Studios make it all come together

958
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:04,341
into something that's even bigger
than what came before.

959
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:09,471
It's nostalgia for me. It's really weird,
the characters hold a lot of nostalgia

960
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:11,514
because I love them
from when I was younger.

961
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:16,061
And now I've been working at Marvel
for a little beyond 13 years,

962
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:18,813
and those memories are, you know,

963
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:20,617
things I'll cherish
for the rest of my life.

964
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:28,823
[Brown] <i>Every day, across the world,</i>

<i>in theme parks and studios,

00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,548
<i>They're inspiring people.</i>

971
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:47,676
<i>And they're proving over and over again,</i>

972
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:51,763
<i>the power of their imagination.</i>

973
00:57:51,846 --> 00:57:57,644
I'm the same guy that I was when
I graduated from Ithaca College in 1973...

974
00:57:58,728 --> 00:58:01,523
that went to see <i>Cinderella</i>
with my grandparents.

975
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:03,608
I love a great story.

I also happen to love what I do.

979
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:18,373
We primarily, in our storytelling,
manufacture happiness,

980
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:19,916
is the way I like to describe it.

981
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:22,836
That's pretty motivating.
