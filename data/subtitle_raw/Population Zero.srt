00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,649
<i> Let's take this video</i>
<i>to the Idaho side of the park.</i>

2
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,286
But<i> to get to Idaho,</i>
<i> you go out the west entrance.</i>

3
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,587
<i> The west entrance?</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

4
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,656
Is that the region where, um...

5
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,658
Have you heard of this
constitutional loophole thing?

6
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,226
Is that the region
where that is?

7
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,161
Constitutional loophole?
I'm not following that.

8
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,563
You never read any
articles about that stuff?

9
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,698
- No.
-Okay.

10
00:01:40,467 --> 00:03:20,933
Thanks a lot.

11
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,801
- Here you go.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,802
-Have a great day.
-I will.

13
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,341
Knows nothing.

14
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,576
No one knows anything.

15
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,524
<i> Yellowstone national park.</i>

16
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,226
<i> Around every corner</i>
<i> is a reminder</i>

17
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,427
<i> of how still life can be.</i>

18
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,730
<i> How vast it can be.</i>

19
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,267
<i> How true it can be.</i>

20
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,303
<i> Until it isn't.</i>

21
00:02:21,407 --> 00:04:42,813
<i> Yellowstone woke up</i>

22
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,809
<i> to what has to be</i>
<i> the worst crime</i>

23
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,644
<i>in the national park's history.</i>

24
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,713
<i> A bizarre triple homicide,</i>

25
00:02:27,715 --> 00:04:55,428
<i>where the murderer immediately</i>

26
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:30,449
<i> turned himself in</i>
<i> and confessed.</i>

27
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,851
<i> First victim</i>
<i> was by the fire.</i>

28
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,323
The second one, I don't know,
maybe 10 feet from it.

29
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,829
This is where
the third victim was shot.

30
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,264
-Okay.
-By the back wheel?

31
00:02:48,802 --> 00:05:37,602
<i> I just really</i>
<i> can't understand</i>

32
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,704
<i> how a man can commit</i>
<i> all these horrific crimes,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

33
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,806
<i> and then just...</i>

34
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,408
<i> Talk about it like he's</i>

35
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,343
reciting the details
of a traffic violation.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,415
<i> Nobody could</i>
<i> have expected</i>

37
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,952
the side swipe that occurred.

38
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,788
<i> We're talking about</i>
<i>a confessed murderer here.</i>

39
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,558
<i> One who showed no remorse,</i>
<i> no regret.</i>

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,459
This guy should have been
put away for life.

41
00:03:17,664 --> 00:06:35,327
<i> There is no resolution.</i>

42
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:21,800
<i> I mean, it's just this thing</i>
<i> hanging over us.</i>

43
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,435
<i> I think most of the country,</i>
<i> most of the world,</i>

44
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,903
<i> hasn't even heard of this.</i>

45
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,672
Well, this whole thing
was swept under the rug.

46
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:28,941
It's an embarrassment.

47
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,456
<i> My name is Julian pinder.</i>

48
00:03:44,458 --> 00:07:28,914
<i> As a documentary filmmaker,</i>

49
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,726
<i> I believe anything in life</i>
<i> can be fascinating</i>

50
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,329
<i> when you delve</i>
<i> into the details.</i>

51
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,232
<i> I find characters and I</i>
<i> tell a story through them.</i>

52
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,768
<i> Their words, their actions,</i>
<i> their eyes.</i>

53
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,570
<i> But it's a completely</i>
<i> different story</i>

54
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,905
<i> when the camera turns on you.</i>

55
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,839
It's nice.

56
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,442
How's that?

57
00:04:07,513 --> 00:08:15,025
<i> I first heard of this story</i>

58
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:11,483
<i> when I received an email</i>
<i> not too long ago.</i>

59
00:04:12,619 --> 00:08:25,237
<i> Three boys were murdered</i>

60
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,588
<i> in a remote part of</i>
<i> yellowstone national park.</i>

61
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,459
<i> What struck me was</i>
<i> that the murders took place</i>

62
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,729
<i> on April 27th, 2009,</i>

63
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:24,963
<i> nearly five years ago.</i>

64
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,866
<i>Why was I being sent this now?</i>

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,342
<i> The email came from</i>
<i> chasingbison bear@gmail.Com.</i>

66
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,012
<i> I was unsuccessful</i>
<i> in contacting</i>
<i> the source of the email.</i>

67
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,481
<i> But when I did a search,</i>

68
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,384
<i> incredible images</i>
<i> immediately surfaced</i>

69
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,753
<i>of a bear chasing a burnt bison</i>

70
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,289
<i> down a winter road</i>
<i> in yellowstone.</i>

71
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,958
<i> Incredible and unbelievable.</i>

72
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,993
<i> A chase like none other</i>
<i> seen before.</i>

73
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,931
<i> These images would</i>
<i> prove to be a metaphor</i>

74
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,801
<i> for the yellowstone murders.</i>

75
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,476
<i> David drabeck,</i>
<i> Thomas Burnett and Cody Gibbs</i>

76
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,512
<i> were camping in</i>
<i> yellowstone national park,</i>

77
00:05:13,514 --> 00:10:27,026
<i> when tragedy struck.</i>

78
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:17,516
<i> A chance encounter</i>
<i> with a stranger proved fatal</i>

79
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,751
<i> when williston resident,</i>
<i> Dwayne Nelson,</i>

80
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,353
<i> killed the young men</i>

81
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,921
<i> in a self-described</i>
<i> moment of insanity.</i>

82
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,723
<i> Shocking news of</i>
<i> a three person homicide</i>

83
00:05:24,725 --> 00:10:49,448
<i> early this morning.</i>

84
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,692
<i> The suspect turned himself in</i>

85
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,660
<i> just after 5:30 A.M.</i>

86
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,629
<i> In what has to be</i>
<i> the worst crime</i>

87
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,697
<i>in the national park's history.</i>

88
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:33,965
I was here,

89
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,803
and I received a phone call.

90
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,940
It was our family doctor.

91
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,609
<i> There was</i>
<i> an emergency contact thing</i>

92
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,911
<i> in Thomas' wallet.</i>

93
00:05:45,913 --> 00:11:31,824
<i>It was the middle of the night.</i>

94
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,580
<i> I didn't know why</i>
<i> I was getting a call.</i>

95
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,652
I... I dropped to that floor.

96
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,822
And I didn't think I was
ever going to get up again.

97
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,525
First thing was...

98
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:02,994
Was violence.

99
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,097
Because, uh...

100
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,666
<i> I heard that</i>
<i> someone shot him...</i>

101
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,635
<i> In the back.</i>

102
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,138
<i> And I... was angry.</i>
<i> I was very angry.</i>

103
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,041
It took a while for

104
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,477
grief to set in.

105
00:06:19,712 --> 00:12:39,423
I didn't believe it.

106
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,015
I thought they'd made
a mistake,

107
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,083
came to the wrong house,

108
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,719
<i> had the wrong boy.</i>

109
00:06:27,721 --> 00:12:55,440
<i> I didn't believe it.</i>

110
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,756
<i> I didn't believe it</i>
<i> till I actually saw his body.</i>

111
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,165
<i> On that day</i>
<i> I can remember</i>
<i> pretty much everything.</i>

112
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,901
<i> I remember</i>
<i> the color of the sky,</i>

113
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,636
<i> the calmness in the air.</i>

114
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,407
I was just here at my post.

115
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,442
This particular
ranger station, um,

116
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,079
is the furthest south-west

117
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,814
that you can get to by vehicle

118
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,916
in yellowstone.

119
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,819
<i> It was just after 5:30</i>
<i> in the morning.</i>

120
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,089
<i> I'd just made myself</i>
<i> a cup of coffee.</i>

121
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,992
<i> He walked out of the woods,</i>

122
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,595
<i> the West Side,</i>
<i> the entrance side.</i>

123
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,497
<i> He left the weapon</i>

124
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,099
outside of the door,

125
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,801
and just walked in.

126
00:07:18,104 --> 00:14:36,207
<i> The way it happened,</i>

127
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,872
<i> you'd think there would</i>
<i> have been some emotion.</i>

128
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,576
But like I said before,

129
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,479
he seemed so calm and, uh...

130
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,781
<i> So normal.</i>

131
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,485
Right here.

132
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,022
This way.

133
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,160
It was right in here
that they parked the truck.

134
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,697
This is where
the third victim was shot,

135
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,132
-by the back wheel.
-Okay.

136
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,701
<i>It's a bit of a clearing here.</i>

137
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,172
And this is where the fire pit

138
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,741
was set up.

139
00:07:56,743 --> 00:15:53,484
Right around here.

140
00:07:56,743 --> 00:08:00,045
This is where the other two
victims were found.

141
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,546
First victim was by the fire,

142
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,249
and the second one,

143
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,651
I don't know,
maybe ten feet from it.

144
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,919
Never stood much of a chance.

145
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,865
The families...

146
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,900
Come and visit them.

147
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,202
They bring flowers and stuff.

148
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,042
<i> But he just wanted</i>
<i> to be outside, all the time.</i>

149
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,144
I mean, he's the guy that
organized all those trips,

150
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,746
every year.

151
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,947
<i>Even when they weren't around,</i>
<i>he'd grab his knapsack</i>

152
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,749
<i> and be gone.</i>

153
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,984
<i> Go off hiking by himself.</i>

154
00:08:38,986 --> 00:17:17,970
<i> He just...</i>

155
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,287
<i> I don't know what</i>
<i> it was about him.</i>

156
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,189
<i> I guess he found</i>
<i> something in nature that...</i>

157
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,791
<i> That put him at peace,</i>
<i> I don't know.</i>

158
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,126
<i> But he loved it.</i>

159
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,632
This is, uh,
Thomas and Alicia.

160
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,966
- Great looking couple.
-Yeah.

161
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,235
And Thomas on his wedding day.

162
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,670
That's a great shot.

163
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,239
And another one of
Thomas and Alicia.

164
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,542
This one over here,
this is, uh...

165
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,210
This is all the boys together.

166
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,745
Thomas, Cody and David.

167
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,115
Oh, you know.
I'll show you this, actually.

168
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,951
Here's...

169
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,656
I took that on the morning
that they left.

170
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,059
They did that trip every year.

171
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,194
Well, David didn't actually
join them until

172
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,195
the third year.

173
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,730
But, uh...

174
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,632
This was their...
This was their fifth year

175
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,001
doing the trip.

176
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,837
You know, they'd all come
over here in the morning,

177
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,306
and they'd have breakfast,
and...

178
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,909
And then they'd leave.

179
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,911
Thomas, he was the one
with the pickup truck. So...

180
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,080
And that's that.

181
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,191
Sorry.

182
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,359
It's all right.

183
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,030
Okay.

184
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,900
<i> I built a business</i>
<i> that I...</i>

185
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,703
<i> Wanted to leave to him.</i>

186
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,606
<i> You know, I respect what he</i>
<i> did and what he loved,</i>

187
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,142
<i> but I thought at some point</i>
<i> he's gotta grow up and accept</i>

188
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,812
<i> who he is and...</i>

189
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,982
<i> You know?</i>

190
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,283
At least make a life
for himself.

191
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,351
Make a career for himself.

192
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,358
- Drive safe.
-Will do. Bye.

193
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,393
-Love you, mom.
-Bye.

194
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,728
<i> He was going off to...</i>

195
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,298
Yellowstone the umpteenth time,

196
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,033
and it was just...

197
00:10:35,035 --> 00:21:10,680
He was on my last nerve
that day.

198
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,970
<i> We'd had a little spat</i>
<i> at dinner the night before,</i>

199
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,305
<i>and then he go... traipse off</i>
<i>to the...</i>

200
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,808
<i> To the park,</i>
<i> and I just, you know...</i>

201
00:10:43,810 --> 00:21:27,618
<i> The last thing I said</i>

202
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,779
was just, you know,
"good luck finding a career.

203
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,181
In the woods."

204
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,816
Or whatever I said. It just...

205
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,655
<i> There are</i>
<i> only four people</i>

206
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,189
<i> who truly know what</i>
<i> happened that night.</i>

207
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,260
<i> Three of them are dead.</i>

208
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,995
<i> The only eye witness account</i>

209
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,830
<i> comes fro Dwayne Nelson,</i>

210
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,198
<i>the man who pulled the trigger.</i>

211
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,835
You know, once the suspect
is talking,

212
00:11:11,937 --> 00:22:23,873
they don't shut up.

213
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,306
<i> It's like they need</i>
<i> to get it out.</i>

214
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,708
<i>But let me tell you something.</i>

215
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,144
<i> With Dwayne,</i>

216
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,211
<i> he gave us everything.</i>

217
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,981
It was almost like the...

218
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,082
It was rehearsed.

219
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,221
<i> I'm standing outside</i>
<i> the Cheyenne police station,</i>

220
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,590
<i>where Dwayne Nelson will</i>
<i>soon be moved to the courthouse</i>

221
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,292
<i>to attend a preliminary hearing</i>

222
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,528
<i>in a case that is being dubbed</i>
<i>"the yellowstone murders."</i>

223
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,196
<i> A bizarre triple homicide,</i>

224
00:15:32,198 --> 00:31:04,394
<i>where the murderer immediately</i>

225
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,699
<i> turned himself in</i>
<i> and confessed.</i>

226
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,269
I just really can't understand

227
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,406
how a man could commit
all these horrific crimes,
you know.

228
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,609
And then just talk about it
like he's, uh...

229
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,078
Reciting the details of
a traffic violation.

230
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,159
<i> If you could say</i>
<i> something to Dwayne Nelson,</i>

231
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,996
<i> and you had that opportunity,</i>
<i> what would you say to him?</i>

232
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,333
<i> If I could</i>
<i> say anything</i>

233
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,068
<i> to Dwayne,</i>

234
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,604
I would say that i
want my son back.

235
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,642
<i> I would say that</i>
<i> I want Cody back.</i>

236
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,578
Out of the way.

237
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,146
<i> He's never offered</i>
<i> me an apology.</i>

238
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,583
<i>He's never taken any</i>
<i>responsibility for his actions.</i>

239
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,651
<i>What will I have to say to him?</i>

240
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,753
Nothing.

241
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,198
We're live now.

242
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,434
He will pay for the murders
of these boys.

243
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,504
And he will understand
what it feels like

244
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,339
to have something
taken away from you.

245
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,509
<i> If I could even just...</i>

246
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,178
Understand why

247
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,415
this person did this,

248
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,784
then I could maybe

249
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,120
move better to forgiveness,
but...

250
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,588
Because it's just so...

251
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,291
Senseless and random.

252
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,496
It shook my faith
for a very long time.

253
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,437
<i> Cheyenne police</i>
<i> spent three months</i>

254
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,571
<i> looking for a motive.</i>

255
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,075
<i> They found none.</i>

256
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,677
<i> With Dwayne's confession,</i>
<i> they were certain</i>
<i> of a conviction.</i>

257
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,553
<i> There were still questions</i>
<i> that needed answering.</i>

258
00:17:37,256 --> 00:35:14,511
<i> I canceled my flight home</i>

259
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,324
<i> and headed to</i>
<i> Cheyenne, Wyoming,</i>

260
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,260
<i> where the hearing</i>
<i> took place years ago.</i>

261
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,075
<i> I think the only</i>
<i> regret I have is...</i>

262
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,243
<i> Is maybe the, uh...</i>

263
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,081
The over-confidence
that we were...

264
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,617
That it was a done thing.

265
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,486
A surefire

266
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,621
win for us.

267
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,622
But I, uh...

268
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,194
I honestly didn't think
that it would go through.

269
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,865
<i> I wouldn't call it arrogant,</i>
<i> but certainly,</i>

270
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,101
<i> it seemed like</i>
<i> an easy case to me.</i>

271
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,669
You wanna take
your feelings out of it,

272
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,472
but we're talking about
a confessed murderer here.

273
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,874
One who showed
no remorse, no regret.

274
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,777
<i> We had murder weapon.</i>

275
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,778
<i> We had fingerprints.</i>

276
00:18:34,646 --> 00:37:09,291
<i> Security footage,</i>

277
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,282
<i> and a population</i>
<i> screaming for justice.</i>

278
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,218
<i> And who wanted him</i>
<i> put away for life.</i>

279
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,487
<i> And at that time, there was</i>

280
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,189
<i> no doubt in my mind we were</i>
<i> gonna do just that.</i>

281
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,129
<i> The fact that</i>
<i> I got the Nelson case</i>
<i> was a surprise.</i>

282
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,463
<i> My first, uh...</i>

283
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,832
<i> Murder trial.</i>

284
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,702
And I knew it was
gonna be a big deal.

285
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,604
Uh...

286
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,707
And it was a big deal.

287
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,476
Dwayne's case was very unique.

288
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,378
Okay?

289
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,182
What you had here was

290
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,416
a classic plea pardon case.

291
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,921
There was no logic
to his motivation.

292
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:17,855
Absolutely none.

293
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,827
Which set it up
for an insanity plea.

294
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,429
I wanted to change
the location of the trial.

295
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,499
I wanted to, uh...

296
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,800
Make sure that we had
an impartial jury.

297
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,302
He wouldn't stand for it.

298
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,337
The loophole was
brought up to me

299
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,773
almost exactly 24 hours
before we went to the hearing.

300
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,279
So we looked at it.
We looked at it,

301
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,847
we danced around it,
it was a conversation.

302
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,416
And, uh...

303
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,285
And then we looked into
the legalities of it.

304
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,421
Then we ran with it.

305
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,858
<i> Will the defendant</i>
<i> please rise.</i>

306
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,295
<i> Based on federal and</i>
<i> district law,</i>

307
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:00,698
<i> the constitution and with no</i>
<i> legal precedent to draw from,</i>

308
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,934
<i> I have no choice but to</i>
<i> side with the defense.</i>

309
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,602
<i>Mr. Nelson, you are free to go.</i>

310
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,407
<i> The murder trial</i>
<i> in Cheyenne this morning</i>

311
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,776
<i> has taken yet another</i>
<i> unexpected turn.</i>

312
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,578
<i> During today's</i>
<i> preliminary hearing,</i>

313
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,313
<i> confessed murderer,</i>
<i> Dwayne Nelson,</i>

314
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,848
<i> was acquitted of all charges</i>

315
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,985
<i> due to what can only be</i>
<i> described as</i>
<i> a flaw in the system.</i>

316
00:20:20,987 --> 00:40:41,972
<i> ...an unusual case.</i>

317
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,355
<i> And families are</i>
<i> understandably shocked</i>

318
00:20:24,357 --> 00:40:48,712
<i> with the judge's decision.</i>

319
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,891
<i> Imagine a murderer</i>
<i> being allowed to</i>

320
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,826
<i>walk the streets as a free man.</i>

321
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,495
<i> That's exactly what took</i>
<i> place here today.</i>

322
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,736
I remember there was
absolute confusion

323
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,004
and shock.

324
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,239
All hell broke loose.

325
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,974
Right? It was...

326
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,643
Insanity.

327
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:48,446
We weren't prepared for that.
I wasn't prepared for that.

328
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,314
This guy should have been
put away for life.

329
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,418
<i> It was so far beyond logic.</i>

330
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,988
<i> So far beyond reason.</i>

331
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,723
<i> It was... it was...</i>

332
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,525
<i> Beyond justice.</i>

333
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,330
<i> And the worst part</i>
<i> was feeling the shift.</i>

334
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,668
You know, 'cause it
was like Dwayne

335
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,902
was no longer the bad guy.

336
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,038
I was.

337
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,043
<i> And it was</i>
<i> the assistants that came in</i>

338
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,379
<i>and gave us the news initially.</i>

339
00:21:22,547 --> 00:42:45,093
<i>So they could be the recipients</i>

340
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:27,285
<i> of all of our grief and all</i>
<i> of our anger at that moment.</i>

341
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,520
And then the head team came in

342
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,022
and explained to us
what had happened.

343
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,426
<i> The loophole</i>
<i>in the law changed everything.</i>

344
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,396
<i> And unless we could prove</i>

345
00:21:38,398 --> 00:43:16,794
<i> that the murders</i>
<i> were premeditated,</i>

346
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:42,967
<i>or that a felony was committed</i>
<i>leading up to the murders,</i>

347
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,469
<i> this crime could not</i>
<i> and cannot be tried.</i>

348
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,537
<i> You need a motive.</i>

349
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,806
We need motive
to move the trail,

350
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,875
to get him out from under
the protection of
that goddamn loophole.

351
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,378
<i> We had</i>
<i> covered all the bases.</i>

352
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,013
<i> We had looked for</i>
<i> any connection</i>

353
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,316
<i> between Dwayne Nelson</i>
<i> and his murder victims.</i>

354
00:21:58,318 --> 00:43:56,634
<i> But there wasn't any.</i>

355
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,584
<i> Dwayne was from north Dakota,</i>

356
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,087
<i> and the boys were</i>
<i> from rapid city.</i>

357
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,023
So, as Dwayne confessed,

358
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,659
it was an isolated incident.
There was no motive.

359
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,864
<i> We were all regular...</i>

360
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,433
<i> People who didn't</i>
<i> even understand</i>

361
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:16,834
<i> half of the system</i>
<i> to begin with.</i>

362
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,839
<i> And once we began</i>
<i> with the whole</i>

363
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,911
state line, federal,
the state...

364
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,948
I think we just assumed
that they would work it out.

365
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,586
I don't think anyone
really understood

366
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,555
the ramifications of this.

367
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,123
I think there was a feeling,

368
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,025
certainly in me,

369
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,094
and I know in a few
of the others, was that

370
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:46,530
this was just maybe
the first step

371
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,034
in crossing this huge hurdle,

372
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,770
<i> and that we would</i>
<i> stick with it,</i>

373
00:22:52,772 --> 00:45:45,542
<i> and there would be appeals,</i>

374
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:57,842
<i> and everyone would throw</i>
<i> their weight behind this.</i>

375
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,678
<i>And as the weeks,</i>
<i>and eventually months, passed,</i>

376
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,381
<i> and we realized,</i>

377
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:07,051
<i> "no. No, this isn't...</i>
<i> This isn't changing.</i>

378
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,554
This really is not changing
in our favor."

379
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,591
There was an incredible
amount of anger.

380
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,793
I don't feel guilty for
adhering to the constitution.

381
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,163
I don't feel guilty

382
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,965
doing what's right
according to the law.

383
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,101
Right? I don't feel guilty

384
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,437
for letting a man walk

385
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,106
because the constitution
says that he should.

386
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,041
I'm doing my job.

387
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,178
The court did their job.

388
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,880
We all did our job on this.

389
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,184
He walks.
He's supposed to walk.

390
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,186
Right?

391
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,791
Simple.

392
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,431
The fuck are we on?

393
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,599
Left on the main street.

394
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,203
<i> Daniel matcek was</i>
<i> a local yellowstone</i>
<i> newspaper reporter.</i>

395
00:23:59,205 --> 00:47:58,408
<i> He covered the hearings</i>

396
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,973
<i> and spent a lot of time</i>
<i> researching the murders.</i>

397
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,942
<i> It's a small town,</i>

398
00:24:04,944 --> 00:48:09,886
<i> and I've lived here</i>
<i> my whole life.</i>

399
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,446
<i> And nothing like this has</i>
<i> ever happened before.</i>

400
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,982
<i> So I have a responsibility</i>
<i> to tell the story.</i>

401
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:16,720
<i> I actually call my article</i>
<i> "the inconceivable truth".</i>

402
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,123
It's so funny that it
became a constitutional debate.

403
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,592
Three boys were shot

404
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,993
and killed.

405
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,829
In cold blood.

406
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,797
This is not
a constitutional issue.

407
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,566
It became
a constitutional issue

408
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,569
because Dwayne made it
a constitutional issue.

409
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,138
There's three dead boys,

410
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,606
and no one went to jail for it.

411
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,775
No one was punished for it.

412
00:24:38,210 --> 00:49:16,419
What did he do?

413
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:42,246
Six months for illegal
possession of a firearm

414
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,848
in a national park?

415
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,949
It's a joke.

416
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,517
That is a joke

417
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,985
to those families.

418
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,588
I am still angry.

419
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,957
I'm still in shock.

420
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:59,029
I still feel completely
betrayed by a system that

421
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,732
not only did I think
that was on my side,

422
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,134
but I was assured
it was on my side.

423
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,836
Who came up
with the loophole defense?

424
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,239
I don't recall.

425
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,007
I don't recall.

426
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,275
We started throwing around...

427
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,777
It was an idea that...

428
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,180
Looked more and more
interesting the more
we looked at it.

429
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,748
And we started to run with it.

430
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,150
But you don't recall
who came up with the one--

431
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,919
I don't recall.

432
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:24,722
I find that impossible
to believe.

433
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,123
-You find that
impossible to believe?
-Yeah.

434
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,792
Look, uh...

435
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,060
It was the basis of
your entire--

436
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,262
I was told that you were
coming in here

437
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:32,863
to talk to me

438
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,598
about practicing law
in Cheyenne.

439
00:25:34,600 --> 00:51:09,198
Well, this is part of it.

440
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,668
Not specific elements
about specific cases. Okay?

441
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,136
You want that stuff?

442
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,038
If you want it,
you can go down to the court,

443
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,841
there are court records,
you can take a look
at all that stuff.

444
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:44,875
Okay? It's all there for you.

445
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,611
-Okay.
-All right? Are we good here?

446
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:48,679
Can we just back up a little?

447
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,114
'Cause I'm good.

448
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,982
I'm good. All right?
Thank you very much.

449
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,217
I appreciate you coming by,
i really do.

450
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,318
Thank you. Thank you.

451
00:26:03,962 --> 00:52:07,923
<i> I went</i>
<i> to the courthouse,</i>

452
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:07,631
<i> but was denied access</i>
<i> to the records.</i>

453
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,667
<i> I was told the documents</i>
<i> had been sealed,</i>

454
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:10,901
<i>but they couldn't tell me why.</i>

455
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,781
<i> Investigating the loophole,</i>
<i> however,</i>

456
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:24,715
<i> was much easier.</i>

457
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,921
<i> The constitution is</i>
<i> the supreme law</i>

458
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,057
<i> for every citizen living</i>
<i> in the United States.</i>

459
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,126
<i> But the constitution</i>
<i> that protects us</i>

460
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,128
<i> also let a murderer go free.</i>

461
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,801
<i> Article three, section two</i>
<i> of the constitution...</i>

462
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,043
<i>This, however, does not clarify</i>

463
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,244
<i> where the jury</i>
<i> should come from.</i>

464
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,381
<i> So the sixth amendment</i>
<i> was written,</i>

465
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,083
<i> requiring that</i>
<i> the jury must be...</i>

466
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,359
<i> So based on the constitution,</i>

467
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:10,194
<i>any person charged with murder</i>

468
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:12,730
<i> must be tried</i>
<i> before a local jury</i>

469
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,132
<i> that comes from</i>
<i> the state and district</i>

470
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,734
<i>in which the crime took place.</i>

471
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,871
<i> Yellowstone national park,</i>

472
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,374
<i> established back in 1872,</i>

473
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:26,410
<i> recognized as the first</i>
<i> national park in the world.</i>

474
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:30,314
<i> It is predominantly situated</i>
<i> in the north-west corner</i>
<i> of Wyoming.</i>

475
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,183
<i> But approximately nine</i>
<i> percent of yellowstone</i>

476
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,919
<i> overflows north into Montana,</i>

477
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,122
<i> and west into Idaho.</i>

478
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,290
<i> The strip of the park</i>
<i> located in Idaho</i>

479
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,360
<i> is where the law and</i>
<i> civil rights collide.</i>

480
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,098
<i> Yellowstone park is not</i>
<i> governed by state law.</i>

481
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,334
<i>It is ruled under federal law.</i>

482
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,771
<i> So any crime committed</i>
<i> in the park</i>

483
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,273
<i> must be tried</i>
<i> at the courthouse</i>
<i> in mammoth hot Springs.</i>

484
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:59,043
<i> Or in Cheyenne at</i>
<i> the federal district court.</i>

485
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,012
<i> So what does this all mean?</i>

486
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,716
<i> The jurors must be drawn</i>
<i> from this small strip of land</i>

487
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,818
<i> of approximately</i>
<i> 50 square miles.</i>

488
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,754
<i> There is only one problem.</i>

489
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,157
<i> No one lives here.</i>

490
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,959
<i>You cannot select a jury of 12</i>

491
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,763
<i> from an area that has</i>
<i> a population of zero.</i>

492
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,812
Hello, sir.

493
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:36,447
Can I ask you a question?

494
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:37,948
Sorry to interrupt you.

495
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,016
I know you're in the middle
of your meal there.

496
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,250
But, uh...

497
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,087
You or anyone from your herd

498
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,321
happen to have
been in the region

499
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,756
where there's, uh,

500
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,858
a supposed
constitutional loophole,

501
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,892
near the Idaho side?

502
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,462
No?

503
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,063
Or any of your family
or associates?

504
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,399
Nothing?

505
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,235
Deutsch? Speak deutsch?

506
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,010
It's just right up here.

507
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,125
So if these maps are right,

508
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,060
I think this is pretty much
the line here.

509
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,864
So somewhere around here...

510
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,467
Is the loophole in
the constitution.

511
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,803
And somewhere around here

512
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,006
is the no loophole
in the constitution.

513
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,043
So the boundary is
kind of right there.

514
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,012
Most people,
when they hear about it,

515
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,448
they focus on the simple
matters of the case.

516
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,382
They...

517
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,452
Broad strokes.

518
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,521
The murders, the hole
in the constitution.

519
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:52,122
And understandably so.

520
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,291
I mean, these are
the boldest parts of the case.

521
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,827
But you can't,
and you really shouldn't

522
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,296
miss the kind of

523
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,064
mind boggling things

524
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,433
that happened from the murders

525
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,102
up until the court hearing.

526
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,136
All right?

527
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,871
Number one.

528
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,440
Dwayne turns himself in
voluntarily almost immediately.

529
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,442
Number two...

530
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,912
He confesses,
within his rights,

531
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,547
without representation
or legal counsel.

532
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,881
Number three...

533
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,082
He refuses

534
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,884
to plead insanity.

535
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,586
Number four, he refuses to move

536
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,122
the trial.

537
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,390
Now if you add all
those four things up,

538
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,058
and he goes away
for a triple homicide,

539
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,593
you can say, "fine."

540
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,029
But he didn't.
He got away with it.

541
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,097
And not because he
had a fair trial,

542
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,068
or there was reasonable
doubt raised.

543
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,837
But that there was
a hole in the constitution.

544
00:30:40,538 --> 01:01:21,075
An overlap.

545
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,509
Now you consider those
four things again.

546
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,078
Without them,

547
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,881
he goes away for
a very, very long time.

548
00:30:52,050 --> 01:01:44,990
So you're suggesting that

549
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:56,019
Dwayne knew exactly
what he was doing?

550
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,322
That's exactly what
I'm suggesting.

551
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,324
Of course, the only person
that's gonna know
the answer to that

552
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,992
is Dwayne.

553
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,560
Why haven't there been
further investigations
into this?

554
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,462
Well, this whole thing was
swept under the rug.

555
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,865
It's an embarrassment.

556
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,634
A hole in the constitution!

557
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,005
No, I think the right people
leaned in the right places

558
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,340
to make sure that this
all went away

559
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,108
before it became
a national uproar.

560
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,377
So the government basically
helped a guilty man go free,

561
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,478
is what you're saying?

562
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,647
No. I'm saying
Dwayne helped himself.

563
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,251
This cover up

564
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:29,419
is just a happy consequence
for him.

565
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,958
<i> When you dig</i>
<i> into Dwayne's past,</i>

566
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,629
<i> you're gonna find a broken,</i>
<i> shattered man.</i>

567
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,597
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> I watched his interrogation,</i>

568
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,133
<i> his confession.</i>

569
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,401
<i> Was that a man on the edge,</i>

570
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,069
<i> or a man in complete control?</i>

571
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:50,941
<i> The only person who really</i>
<i> knows what happened that day</i>

572
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,476
<i> is Dwayne.</i>

573
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,215
<i> I decided to head</i>
<i>out to williston, north Dakota,</i>

574
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,651
<i> to see what the people of</i>
<i> Dwayne's hometown had to say.</i>

575
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,523
Have you heard of
the yellowstone murders

576
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,491
and Dwayne Nelson?

577
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,458
-Yes.
-Yeah.

578
00:32:08,460 --> 01:04:16,918
You have.

579
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,128
Can I just ask you a quick
question about them?

580
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,429
-Oh, no.
-No?

581
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,964
We really don't wanna
answer any questions.

582
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,365
Okay. Thanks very much anyway.

583
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,275
No, I'm really not interested.

584
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,277
No? Okay, well, thank you.

585
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,480
Sorry, not right now.
I really must run.

586
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,982
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sorry.

587
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,523
Ever heard of Dwayne Nelson
and the yellowstone murders?

588
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,425
Uh, yeah. Sir, I don't
wanna talk about that.

589
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,660
Can you just answer
just maybe on... no?

590
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:44,661
Fuck!

591
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,968
<i> People in town were</i>
<i> reluctant to speak at all.</i>

592
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,705
<i> But those closest to Dwayne</i>
<i> before the murders</i>

593
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,273
<i> welcomed us with open arms.</i>

594
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,489
-Hi, Rachel?
-Hi. Yeah.

595
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,523
How are you? Julian.

596
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,624
-Julian? Hi.
-Yeah.

597
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,592
This is Adam.

598
00:33:16,194 --> 01:06:32,387
Right.

599
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,263
Come on in.
I'll take your coat.

600
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,598
Okay. Thank you very much.

601
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,167
So you knew Dwayne?

602
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,135
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

603
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,436
-Dwayne and Carol. Yeah.
-Okay.

604
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,738
-They were like family.
-Were they?

605
00:33:27,740 --> 01:06:55,478
-Lovely couple.
-Okay.

606
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,141
<i> After graduating</i>
<i> high school late,</i>

607
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,609
<i>Dwayne married his sweetheart,</i>

608
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,045
<i>Carol harson, at the age of 23.</i>

609
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,515
<i> She met Dwayne...</i>

610
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,151
Actually we were
in the car together.

611
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,121
And we were going to, uh...

612
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,323
To the bar and...

613
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,625
It was winter
and the car got stuck.

614
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:52,362
And, um...

615
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:56,566
I was driving, and she was
out trying to push the car,

616
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,136
and Dwayne came by

617
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,772
and he was sort of like
a knight in shining armor.

618
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,740
I wasn't too sure
about him at first.

619
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:04,775
He, uh...

620
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,277
He was really quiet.

621
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,311
<i> Like really quiet.</i>

622
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,814
<i> And smart.</i>

623
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,449
<i> But he, uh...</i>

624
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,553
He just was...

625
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,156
He wasn't what I thought
Carol would go for.

626
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,628
<i> He was a great family man.</i>

627
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,563
<i> Him and Carol, they were...</i>

628
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,598
<i> They were close, and...</i>

629
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,401
You know, I...

630
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,203
He's the kind of guy
that you'd wanna

631
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:36,139
emulate, I guess,
is a good word to use.

632
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:39,342
<i> You probably had it</i>
<i> growing up, too, that buddy,</i>

633
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,478
<i> you know, that you could</i>
<i> just conversate with.</i>

634
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,280
You know?

635
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,148
There was no dead space
when you spoke with him.

636
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,617
Oh, us going back.

637
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,388
Bear took us into yellowstone
many times.

638
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,091
I would...

639
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:57,427
I would tag along when
my family didn't

640
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,296
want me around,

641
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:00,797
or whatever.

642
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,332
And Dwayne...

643
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,768
Dwayne and bear,

644
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,603
they went in
pretty much all the time.

645
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,171
Sorry, "bear"?

646
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,873
<i> Bear, his dad.</i>
<i> He called bear.</i>

647
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,675
<i> Um...</i>

648
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,510
<i> Yeah.</i>

649
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,179
Yeah. He was, uh...

650
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,617
You know, sometimes you get...

651
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,552
When the husband's watching TV,
you know,

652
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,521
the wife's always complaining.

653
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:27,891
"He's not with us enough.
He's not with us enough."
Right?

654
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:30,327
But you know, Carol,
she just...

655
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,463
She let him be him,

656
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,898
and he let her be her.

657
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,503
<i> Five years</i>
<i> into their marriage,</i>

658
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:42,172
<i> Carol gave birth to</i>
<i> their first child, Lily.</i>

659
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:45,175
<i> However, when Lily was only</i>
<i> six-years-old,</i>

660
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,210
<i> there was a deadly accident</i>
<i> in their home.</i>

661
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,314
<i> A fire erupted</i>
<i> in their kitchen.</i>

662
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,217
<i> Dwayne heard his child's</i>
<i> screams from outside,</i>

663
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,253
<i> and ran to try to save her.</i>

664
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,255
<i> But the fire had</i>
<i> raged too long.</i>

665
00:35:59,223 --> 01:11:58,445
<i> Lily was already dead,</i>

666
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:04,928
<i> and Dwayne suffered</i>
<i> third degree burns</i>
<i> on his hands and arms.</i>

667
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,598
<i> It's devastating</i>
<i>when your child dies like that.</i>

668
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,867
<i> I can't imagine myself,</i>

669
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,669
<i> but for them...</i>

670
00:36:14,372 --> 01:12:28,743
It was horrible.

671
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:18,275
I think Carol somehow dealt
with it better than Dwayne,

672
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,543
in a way.

673
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:21,945
The scars that he had,

674
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,949
that was like his memory
of her.

675
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,885
He just shut down.

676
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,555
<i> It's remarkable,</i>

677
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,857
I think that their
marriage survived that.

678
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,294
Because lots
of marriages don't,
you know.

679
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,329
When you lose a child, it's...

680
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,565
It's a terrible,
terrible thing.

681
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,803
<i> He was ecstatic, you know,</i>

682
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,538
when Carol became
pregnant again.

683
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,208
<i> You know? But, um...</i>

684
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,777
<i> He was, um...</i>

685
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,214
<i> Absolutely terrified of</i>
<i> losing another child.</i>

686
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,221
<i> If that was</i>
<i> gonna happen, you know,</i>

687
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,356
<i> you'd want it</i>
<i> to happen to like,</i>

688
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,724
<i> and evil person, you know.</i>

689
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,892
<i> But I mean, he was...</i>

690
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,695
He was one of the good guys.

691
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,332
It's terrible.

692
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,900
Then Carol was diagnosed
with cancer.

693
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,971
<i> And she was</i>
<i> four-and-a-half months</i>
<i> pregnant.</i>

694
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:24,774
<i> So...</i>

695
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,010
<i> She had to make a choice.</i>

696
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,916
Take the chemotherapy and

697
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,387
risk the health of
her baby, or...

698
00:37:39,757 --> 01:15:19,513
Well...

699
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,495
When Carol died,
that was it for Dwayne.

700
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,001
He still lived in town, but he
practically disappeared.

701
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,839
Could you
tel me about how

702
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:58,408
the death of Carol affected you

703
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,643
on a personal level?

704
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,978
She was my best friend.

705
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,581
Um...

706
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:06,816
And I still miss her.

707
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,653
It was hard.

708
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,423
Uh...

709
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,728
It was hard.

710
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,597
<i> The loss</i>
<i> is just so deep,</i>

711
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,902
<i> that anything you say</i>
<i> is stupid.</i>

712
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,473
You know?
It's gonna get better?

713
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,042
You're gonna say that to him?
It's gonna get better?

714
00:38:32,044 --> 01:17:04,860
'Cause it's not gonna
get better.

715
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,847
<i> I wasn't in touch</i>
<i> with him much,</i>

716
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,816
<i> you know, at that time.</i>

717
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,984
<i> But you know,</i>
<i> that's life, right?</i>

718
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,852
I mean, people drift apart.

719
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,987
That's what happens, man.

720
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,790
Everybody leaves everybody
in the end.

721
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:48,625
Right?

722
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:51,428
Uh, the baby was...

723
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,432
It was not...

724
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,067
Quite right.

725
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,935
It was premature.

726
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,437
<i> And, uh...</i>

727
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:04,341
<i> His little lungs</i>
<i> weren't formed properly.</i>

728
00:39:07,011 --> 01:18:14,210
<i> It's understandable that</i>

729
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:11,514
<i> such a series of tragedies</i>
<i> would change a person.</i>

730
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,583
For him, it...

731
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,353
He had to find a reason

732
00:39:17,355 --> 01:18:34,709
why these things happened.

733
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:20,757
It was inconceivable
that it could just...

734
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,027
That that could just happen.

735
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,795
I don't blame him
for thinking that.

736
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,133
What I do blame him for
is what he did.

737
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,935
What I blame him for
is the fact that he

738
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,938
sought out a way

739
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,907
to punish us all

740
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,844
for what he thought
happened to him.

741
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,630
<i> There was no way</i>
<i> of contacting Dwayne.</i>

742
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,399
<i>Any numbers I managed to dig up</i>

743
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,900
<i> rang without a machine.</i>

744
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,436
<i> There were no</i>
<i> email addresses, nothing.</i>

745
00:40:07,972 --> 01:20:15,943
<i> Through further research,</i>

746
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:12,008
<i> I found a po box</i>
<i> located in a small town,</i>

747
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,144
<i> just outside</i>
<i> of windsor, Ontario.</i>

748
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,846
<i> He was living in Canada now.</i>

749
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,717
<i> The more research I did,</i>

750
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,152
<i>the more questions were raised.</i>

751
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,568
<i> After his wife passed,</i>

752
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,604
<i> Dwayne spent a lot of time</i>
<i> at the local library.</i>

753
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,973
<i> We were all</i>
<i> so broken up about it.</i>

754
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,943
<i> After Carol passed,</i>

755
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,813
<i> he never really recovered,</i>
<i> I think.</i>

756
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,451
<i> I didn't wanna pry too much.</i>

757
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:57,654
<i> And he wasn't the kind of</i>
<i> person who made you</i>
<i> feel comfortable.</i>

758
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,824
<i> He liked it here.</i>

759
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,494
He didn't talk to anybody.
We just left him alone.

760
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,697
Quiet. Quiet guy.

761
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,834
<i> It's a small town,</i>

762
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,102
we all go to church, and...

763
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,475
I think when we found out that
Dwayne had done these things,

764
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:22,011
there was a real feeling
of betrayal.

765
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:25,181
How could somebody that
was part of our community

766
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:26,516
have gone so wrong?

767
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,855
I'll tell you. It was all
anyone talked about
for a long time.

768
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,657
But nobody really wants
to talk about it anymore.

769
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,995
<i> They were three young boys,</i>

770
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,830
<i> you know, and...</i>

771
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,501
<i> I don't know, it's...</i>

772
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:48,238
I've got a lot of
mixed feelings about
the whole thing, obviously.

773
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,006
Why would he...

774
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,875
Do that?

775
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,810
You know?
He knows what loss is.

776
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,678
Right? He<i> knows</i> what loss is.

777
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,214
He lost Carol, he lost Lily.

778
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:02,886
You know, these boys,
they're someone's son.

779
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:05,288
Right? He knows what it's like
to lose a child. He knows.

780
00:42:08,692 --> 01:24:17,383
<i> I was still confused</i>

781
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:13,930
<i> as to why a seemingly</i>
<i> good natured,</i>
<i> hard working family man</i>

782
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:18,668
<i> would brutally murder David,</i>
<i> Cody and Thomas.</i>

783
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,238
<i> Three young men,</i>
<i> who by all accounts,</i>

784
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,907
<i> were innocent.</i>

785
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,579
Cody, growing up, was lovely.

786
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:34,183
He was smart and funny.

787
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,654
Very, uh, very happy kid.
Very open kid.

788
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,691
<i> And wonderful</i>
<i> with other children,</i>

789
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:45,228
<i> whether they were younger,</i>
<i> older, or his own age.</i>
<i> He was always...</i>

790
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,230
<i> A very compassionate child.</i>

791
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,632
Thomas met Cody at...

792
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,668
They were doing...

793
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,237
They were both going
for their bronze cross.

794
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,039
<i> They were trying</i>
<i> to be lifeguards.</i>

795
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,808
<i> And they were both</i>
<i> in the same...</i>

796
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,644
<i> I think they were both in</i>
<i> the same instructor's class.</i>

797
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,279
<i> And they hit it off.</i>

798
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:07,350
<i>And the next thing I knew,</i>
<i>they were really good friends.</i>

799
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:11,187
So do you remember
how David met
Cody and Thomas?

800
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,694
<i> David met</i>
<i> Cody and Thomas</i>

801
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,729
in junior high.

802
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,131
He was, um...

803
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,968
<i> He was always very...</i>

804
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,905
<i> Full of life and mischief</i>
<i> and jokes.</i>

805
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:31,040
<i> He liked to pull</i>
<i> practical jokes on us</i>

806
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,910
and things like that.

807
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,346
<i> I caught them</i>
<i> trying to take the canoe.</i>

808
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:38,014
<i> And they didn't know</i>
<i> how to use it,</i>

809
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:39,182
<i> and they weren't wearing</i>
<i> life jackets.</i>

810
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,218
I gave them a rather stern
talking to,

811
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,087
and then immediately jumped
in the canoe myself

812
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:45,855
to show 'em how to do it,

813
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,624
and capsized the canoe.

814
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,660
<i> That's probably the...</i>

815
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,929
<i> That's probably the most</i>
<i> I've ever seen Cody laugh.</i>

816
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,716
<i> The very nature</i>
<i> of a documentary</i>

817
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:15,685
<i> is truth and reality.</i>

818
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,320
<i> But what truth</i>
<i> are you presenting?</i>

819
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,757
<i> A murderer's, a judge's,</i>
<i> your own?</i>

820
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,191
<i>It's a perception of the truth.</i>

821
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:23,660
<i> What was the real story?</i>

822
00:44:23,662 --> 01:28:47,322
<i> What really happened?</i>

823
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:27,897
<i> There was no doubt that</i>
<i> Dwayne's story</i>
<i> was heartbreaking.</i>

824
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,437
<i> There was an unrelenting</i>
<i> feeling that something</i>
<i> was missing.</i>

825
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,341
<i> It wasn't that</i>
<i> everything didn't add up.</i>

826
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,109
<i> It added up too perfectly.</i>

827
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,725
Yeah, roll it, man.
It's fine. Yeah.

828
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:57,894
-Just come over here for
a minute and watch this.
-Okay. What you got?

829
00:44:57,896 --> 00:44:59,162
I want you to see this, man.

830
00:45:00,431 --> 01:30:00,861
Look at this.

831
00:45:00,432 --> 01:30:00,862
<i> When did they</i>
<i> start going up there?</i>

832
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:06,202
<i> I think Cody and Thomas</i>
<i> were going out there</i>

833
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,371
<i> for a few years</i>
<i> before David joined them.</i>

834
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,408
Did David spend
much time
in yellowstone on his own?

835
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,111
No, he didn't.
I mean, not to our knowledge.

836
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:17,914
No, he wasn't the outdoors-man
that Cody was.

837
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,450
In Dwayne's confession
he states that it was David

838
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:22,351
<i> who suggested the site</i>
<i> that they moved to.</i>

839
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,955
<i> I remember that, but...</i>

840
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,157
<i> Like I told Patrick,</i>

841
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,358
<i> that had to be a mistake.</i>

842
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,894
Cody must have suggested it.

843
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,329
I mean, our boy
wouldn't have known
to go to that spot.

844
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,399
See?

845
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,234
Dwayne specifically said

846
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,403
that it was David who
suggested that site.

847
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,238
I mean, we've got the--

848
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,006
you know, he could have
gotten the name wrong.

849
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,808
Yeah, then he might not
have as well.

850
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,079
I've got the confession
right here.

851
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,816
A transcript of the exact
confession that Dwayne says,

852
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:57,053
"i was gathering to leave
when Dave suggested
something a little different.

853
00:45:59,089 --> 01:31:59,770
About an hour..."
And blah, blah, blah.

854
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,926
"...that Dave stumbled across
a large area of these
on previous trips."

855
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,096
"Dave suggested
something a little different."

856
00:46:07,098 --> 01:32:15,940
-That's what Dwayne said.
-Okay.

857
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,800
And everything Dwayne says
is so precise

858
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,402
and so specific.

859
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:15,138
So, wait. You're thinking
there's a connection

860
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,539
between Dwayne and Dave?

861
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,207
A motive?

862
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,408
I'm just thinking that

863
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,211
everything so far
is so clean and so clear,

864
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,781
and this is really
the only whisper

865
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:26,082
of something that
doesn't compute.

866
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:34,290
So what are we
doing at 6:27 A.M.?

867
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,325
We got a call
from Theresa Fitzgerald.

868
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,928
The librarian?

869
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,263
The librarian.

870
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:46,169
She received
a visit last night
as she was closing up,

871
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,004
from Dwayne Nelson.

872
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,943
Theresa hasn't spoken
to anyone in years and years.

873
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,278
And we go to visit her,

874
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,148
and a few days later,
suddenly Dwayne shows up?

875
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,918
You think he's following us?

876
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,554
Well, obviously
he knows about us

877
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:06,389
and he's worried
about something.

878
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,024
He definitely worried
about something.

879
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,895
I don't know if
there's that much to tell.

880
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,934
So did you feel threatened
at all when he came in?

881
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:19,001
Oh, no.

882
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,269
No, he's very polite.

883
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:22,338
It was just a shock.

884
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,473
But he did ask you if you'd
been talking to anyone?

885
00:47:24,475 --> 01:34:48,948
Yeah, he did.

886
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:28,444
And I told him
about the documentary,

887
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:32,348
but after all, I only really
talked about Carol when
you interviewed me.

888
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,518
See, what's weird is that

889
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,054
I've contacted everyone
we interviewed,

890
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,857
and Dwayne hasn't tried to
get a hold of any of them.

891
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,359
So I'm wondering
what I'm missing here.

892
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,495
I don't know.

893
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,531
I don't know if there's
anything more to tell.

894
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,267
He came in in the morning,
left at night.

895
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:52,535
I told him he could...

896
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,571
Sign out anything he wanted,

897
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:58,274
but he said he preferred
to be in the library.

898
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:00,643
Was that to be closer to
his wife, do you think?

899
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:03,546
-Oh, I assumed so.
-Yeah?

900
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,615
The only other people
spent that much time here

901
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:07,884
are students doing research.

902
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,318
Right.

903
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,190
Did he ever take any of
the books home
that he was reading?

904
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,892
Uh, nope.

905
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,260
Not that I can remember.

906
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,928
And if you don't
check a book out,

907
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,396
is there any record
of what you've been reading?

908
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,665
No, of course not.

909
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,367
Do you have any idea
what he was reading?

910
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,603
Like I said, he just
sat in the back.

911
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,640
Where was that again?

912
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:31,941
Over in the corner there.

913
00:48:31,943 --> 01:37:03,884
Okay.

914
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,914
<i> Why did Dwayne come back now?</i>

915
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,082
<i> According to Theresa,</i>

916
00:48:40,084 --> 01:37:21,660
<i>he stopped visiting the library</i>

917
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,252
<i> about a year before</i>
<i> he committed the murders,</i>

918
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,187
<i>and had never been back since.</i>

919
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,490
<i> So what was he doing here?</i>

920
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,394
<i> The answer was staring</i>
<i> me in the face.</i>

921
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:53,663
Adam...

922
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,967
<i> Something so obvious,</i>

923
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,368
<i> I'd missed it on</i>
<i> the first visit.</i>

924
00:49:03,707 --> 01:38:07,413
<i> Of course he was looking</i>
<i> at the law books, man.</i>

925
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:07,944
What else are you gonna do
in your local library
law section?

926
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,712
You don't
go to the library,

927
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,214
hoping to find an overlap
in the constitution.

928
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,483
I mean, one that will allow
you to get way with murder?

929
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,252
No, you don't.

930
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,120
But he must have known about
this loophole beforehand.

931
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,423
Otherwise, it's just
what he says.

932
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:22,224
It's a bunch of, you know,
coincidences

933
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:23,592
that let a guilty man go free.

934
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,728
But, Julian, there are
a ton of cases

935
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,564
where people have gotten off
on ridiculous technicalities.

936
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,266
Yeah, but if we find a motive,

937
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:32,635
then we can prove Dwayne
orchestrated the entire thing.

938
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,370
Presuming there's
one to be found.

939
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,108
It's like what
matcek said, man.

940
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,345
It's not a guy who's crazy.

941
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:43,713
He's in complete control.

942
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,483
Patrick, sorry to
bother you again,

943
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,386
but I just got back
from the williston library,

944
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:53,389
and it seems Dwayne
was just there.

945
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:56,325
I also found out that Dwayne
spent a lot of time there

946
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,327
before the murders,
in the law section.

947
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:01,497
I mean, he was looking
at law books.

948
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,032
He was doing research there.

949
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:05,167
Doesn't that indicate
some sort of premeditation,

950
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,236
or a motive,
or something suspicious?

951
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,380
Okay, but he
comes out of hiding,

952
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:19,048
and he goes directly
back to the library?

953
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,449
Isn't that also suspicious?

954
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,061
Okay, no. Patrick, I get that.

955
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,462
But can I just ask you
another question here?

956
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,435
<i> There had to be a motive.</i>

957
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:43,072
<i>There had to be a link between</i>
<i>Dwayne and one of the boys.</i>

958
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,640
<i> I kept coming back</i>
<i> to David drabeck.</i>

959
00:50:45,675 --> 01:41:31,349
<i> According to Dwayne,</i>

960
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:50,746
<i>he was the one that</i>
<i>took them all to</i>
<i>the so called "zone of death".</i>

961
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,782
<i> I hope David's mother</i>
<i> might have some answers.</i>

962
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,718
Any connection maybe
through construction?

963
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,133
One more quick question.

964
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:14,804
Um, did David ever go to
north Dakota for any reason?

965
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:16,572
Have any friends or family
up there?

966
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,455
And who are we talking
about, Mrs. drabeck?

967
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:47,837
What was her name?

968
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,643
Mrs. drabeck, would you be able

969
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,212
to send me that letter,
do you think?

970
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,249
Earlier today, I got this
letter from Nancy drabeck.

971
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,219
She sent me the letter

972
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:05,121
that Kayleigh Brighton sent her

973
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:06,322
now Kayleigh Brighton...

974
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,160
Is not a photographer.
Kayleigh Brighton...

975
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,329
Is an environmental biologist,

976
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:18,501
at a university that happens
to be right above north Dakota.

977
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,903
Come around here, man.
Check this out.

978
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:23,439
I typed in Kayleigh's address
earlier today.

979
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:28,344
And she lives right above
Regina, saskatchewan.

980
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,747
The three boys are
from rapid city.

981
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,483
Check out this route.

982
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,318
Look at that.
Right in the middle.

983
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,621
Williston, Dwayne's hometown,
right where we are.

984
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,725
You're ready for
a road trip, buddy?

985
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,564
What are you
hoping to find?

986
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:51,667
There's a missing link
between Dave and Dwayne.

987
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,569
And I know this girl's got
some answers for us.

988
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,371
Do you realize how
ridiculous this sounds?

989
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,206
This one girl?

990
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,308
And what does this have to
do with Dwayne and Dave
anyways?

991
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,643
Well, you saw the map.

992
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,511
And I've just got
a good feeling about it.

993
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,779
What do you think
she'll tell you?

994
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,782
I have no idea, man.

995
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,486
But I have three hours
and 26 minutes
to figure it out.

996
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,255
She knows something.

997
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,629
I can't see anything in there.

998
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:55,831
Whoa.

999
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,299
It's a fucking pig, man.

1000
00:53:58,802 --> 00:53:59,935
Look at this.

1001
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,407
Hey man, we're looking
for Kayleigh Brighton,
actually.

1002
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,612
What's the camera for?

1003
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:12,348
Well, we're just hoping
to talk to Kayleigh here
for a second.

1004
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,649
What do you wanna talk
to my wife for?

1005
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,317
Listen, man,
we drove a long way.

1006
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,519
I'm just wondering if
i could talk to Kayleigh
for a second.

1007
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:18,721
Shut your camera off.

1008
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,923
Okay. But is she here?
Is she... she your wife?

1009
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:21,991
-Shut your camera off.
-Hey, man.

1010
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:23,359
Listen. Hey, hey, buddy. Hey.

1011
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:24,560
It's up to her,
you understand?

1012
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:26,428
Okay, buddy.

1013
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,330
I don't want you
going up there shoving
a camera in her face.

1014
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:30,399
Also, you know, when you
go up there, you make sure
that camera's off.

1015
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,902
I'm sorry what
happened to the guys.

1016
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,771
But the thing is we don't
have the Internet here.

1017
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,275
We didn't. So I just heard
about it on the radio.

1018
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,676
That's how we heard about it.

1019
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:42,378
- Right.
-But we...

1020
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,947
My parents let me know.
And it was a tragedy.

1021
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,650
Definitely devastating.

1022
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:50,686
I mean, I just can't believe
that happened.

1023
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,621
Yeah, it's a real shock
I'm sure, to hear that

1024
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,856
-about a friend.
-Yeah.

1025
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:55,324
So, okay.

1026
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:56,959
You got me alone.

1027
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,827
I don't even know what you're
looking for though.

1028
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,629
I mean, to be honest,
i don't know what
I'm looking for either.

1029
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:01,930
I'm just chasing every lead.

1030
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,334
But you have no idea

1031
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,536
about who Dwayne is, or...

1032
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,738
No, I have no idea. I'm sorry.

1033
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,473
With, um...

1034
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,043
With David, we worked
at camp together,

1035
00:55:14,045 --> 01:50:28,880
we hung out with
the same friends.

1036
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:19,481
And I might have been
with him for 10 days total.

1037
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,750
And you guys never had
a relationship
or anything like that?

1038
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,086
No, we were just friends,
that's it.

1039
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,029
All right, Julian,
let's get you miked up.

1040
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,664
Here you go.

1041
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,768
What are you doing with this?

1042
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:13,836
I watched this
a bunch of times.

1043
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:16,004
I know there's something...

1044
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:17,706
She's like--

1045
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,974
she's hiding something
for sure.

1046
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,376
Dude, you're reaching, man.

1047
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,744
Everything checks out.

1048
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,548
It's off, man. Something's
wrong with this.

1049
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,584
Come on, man.
It's a dead end.
You know it is.

1050
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,387
Here, take this.
We got work to do.

1051
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,827
<i> Sometimes,</i>
<i> when you're searching for</i>
<i> something so hard,</i>

1052
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,696
<i> you'll connect the dots</i>
<i> with wavy lines</i>

1053
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:42,998
<i> and convince yourself</i>
<i> they're straight.</i>

1054
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,933
<i> Sometimes they just don't</i>
<i> connect at all.</i>

1055
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,974
There's Patrick right there.

1056
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,483
-How you doing?
-Okay, good. You?

1057
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:02,751
Listen...

1058
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,686
Could I see those case files
for a moment?

1059
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,121
I can't give you
those case files.

1060
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:07,923
I could look at them
in your office
if you want, even.

1061
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,892
I'm sorry,
but they're private files.

1062
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,827
I know they're
private files, Patrick.

1063
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,729
-But could I just look at them,
maybe for a second?
-Sorry, I'm late.

1064
00:57:13,731 --> 01:54:27,460
I know there's something
in there, man.

1065
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:17,666
Patrick, maybe I can schedule
something with your assistant?

1066
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:19,768
Patrick!

1067
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:39,521
<i> I had actually accomplished</i>
<i> what I had originally</i>
<i> set out to do,</i>

1068
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,523
<i> which was to document</i>
<i> this bizarre murder case.</i>

1069
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,793
<i> My opinions had changed,</i>

1070
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,695
<i> but a theory is</i>
<i> just speculation.</i>

1071
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,900
<i> Without proof,</i>

1072
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:52,968
<i> without an interview,</i>

1073
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,970
<i> without any shred of motive,</i>

1074
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,739
<i> I was left staring</i>
<i> at the obvious.</i>

1075
00:57:57,741 --> 00:57:59,741
<i> This was simply</i>
<i> a freak occurrence,</i>

1076
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:01,009
<i> nothing more.</i>

1077
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,688
- Adam?

1078
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,126
-Adam.
-What?

1079
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,728
Look at this.
We got a package, man.

1080
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,996
-Wake up.
-What is it?

1081
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:22,931
Wake up. Come on.

1082
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:24,233
Come on, I'm trying to sleep.

1083
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:25,934
Take this.

1084
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,569
Adam, here. Come on.

1085
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,071
Take the camera. Let's go.

1086
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:30,739
Come on.

1087
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,742
- You rolling.
-It's rolling.

1088
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,852
There's nothing in this.

1089
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,887
It's a joke?

1090
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,036
Do you have a phone on you?

1091
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:02,905
I do.

1092
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,124
There's two videos here.

1093
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,266
<i> Wait, wait,</i>
<i> wait, wait, wait.</i>

1094
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,271
<i> I wanna get one</i>
<i> with all of you.</i>

1095
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:38,974
<i> All right. Come on, you guys.</i>

1096
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:40,242
<i> -Yeah?</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

1097
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,677
Oh.

1098
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:42,945
This is something.

1099
00:59:42,947 --> 01:59:25,892
<i> -Good?</i>
<i> -Yeah, great.</i>

1100
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:46,081
<i> It's the annual yellowstone</i>
<i> boys' weekend.</i>

1101
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:47,983
<i> All right?</i>

1102
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,620
Wild.

1103
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,923
Who the fuck got this?

1104
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:13,875
Ooh!

1105
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,789
Holy shit.

1106
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,031
<i> No, no, no.</i>

1107
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:37,132
<i> No, no!</i>

1108
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,101
Holy fuck!

1109
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,076
Ad, who the fuck
dropped this off, man?

1110
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,314
Let's figure this out.

1111
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,260
Here. Right here.

1112
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,162
Let's go down to
the front desk...

1113
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,774
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

1114
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,308
-How are you?
-I'm good.

1115
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,710
Can I ask a big favor of you?

1116
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,012
There.

1117
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,681
-So this is this morning?
-Yeah.

1118
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,883
Okay. That's 5:15.

1119
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:30,018
-Yeah, there he is.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1120
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,753
He's gonna come out over there.

1121
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,891
See?

1122
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:37,959
And this is
my door here?

1123
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:39,094
Yeah.

1124
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:40,429
That's number 15.

1125
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:47,469
Who the fuck is that?

1126
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,279
You don't have any other--

1127
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:58,847
nothing where we can
see someone's face?

1128
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:01,249
You might catch his face
on the other...

1129
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,186
Who is that?

1130
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,823
Is it Dwayne?

1131
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:20,769
<i> All right. This good?</i>

1132
01:02:20,771 --> 02:04:41,540
<i> Yeah, it's great.</i>

1133
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:24,306
<i> I watched the videos</i>
<i> for two days straight,</i>

1134
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:25,974
<i> and I didn't catch anything.</i>

1135
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:30,345
<i> But then, anything in life</i>
<i> can be fascinating</i>

1136
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:32,013
<i> when you delve</i>
<i> into the details.</i>

1137
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:39,187
The director,

1138
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,356
the crew.

1139
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,293
Kraft services...

1140
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,500
And beautiful America.

1141
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,536
Come here.

1142
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:56,204
-Come here.
-What do you need?

1143
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,073
Set up the camera
over here and look at this.

1144
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,274
All right,
all right, hold on.

1145
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,377
-Quit fucking around.
-I'm coming, dude.

1146
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,945
Put that down
and look at this.
Check it out.

1147
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:06,982
You gotta see this.

1148
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:08,850
Yeah. All right.
What am I looking at?

1149
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,152
Just leave that alone for now--

1150
01:03:10,154 --> 02:06:20,306
yes, yes.

1151
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:14,256
Look at this, look at this.
You gotta see this.

1152
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:16,792
- What am I supposed to be looking at?
-What's that?

1153
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,260
-See that logo right there?
-Yeah, on his jacket.

1154
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:19,494
-Yeah, have you seen
that before?
-No.

1155
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:20,896
You've seen that before.

1156
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:21,930
-Okay.
-Look.

1157
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,333
At Dwayne's house,
which is right here...

1158
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:26,802
Look at this.

1159
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,142
What's that right there?
That's the same logo.

1160
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,343
Yeah, what's that?

1161
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:36,511
That's a water
filtration system

1162
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:38,280
that every house in
this area has.

1163
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,915
It's the same company, man.

1164
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,383
-It's enrg. Look at this.
-Whoa, whoa.

1165
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:42,984
"Enrg."

1166
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,219
"Enrg."

1167
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,587
So?

1168
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:47,355
That's the same
company, man. Enrg.

1169
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,456
It's a fracking company.

1170
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,896
Jesus! That's Cody's dad, man.

1171
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:56,198
We might have just
found the motive.

1172
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,505
Raymond fucking Gibbs.

1173
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,574
Wait, wait, wait.

<i> The city of williston has</i>
<i> avoided the current</i>
<i> economic crisis</i>

1177
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,153
<i> due largely to the success</i>

<i>otherwise known as "fracking."</i>

1182

01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,533
<i> Why bother anymore?</i>

1211
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,442
<i> And it's... I don't know.</i>
<i> I don't wanna be a coward.</i>

1212
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,034
<i> Dwayne Nelson's</i>
<i> daughter died</i>

1213
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:15,403
<i> from an unexplained fire</i>
<i> in the kitchen sink.</i>

1214
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,974
<i>Dwayne's wife developed cancer</i>

1215
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:22,644
<i> after receiving a clean</i>
<i> bill of health a year</i>
<i> and a half earlier.</i>

1216
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:25,380
<i> Dwayne's son was born</i>
<i> with several birth defects,</i>

1217
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:28,049
<i> likely caused by harmful</i>
<i> chemicals ingested</i>

1218
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:29,284
<i> during pregnancy.</i>

1219
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,988
<i> Was all this</i>
<i> just a coincidence?</i>

1220
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:36,057
<i> Or were these murders</i>
<i> an elaborate act</i>

1221
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:37,392
<i> of revenge?</i>

- -Rolling.

<i> You have one saved message.</i>

1225
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,376
Okay, get this.

1226
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:55,677
<i> To review your messages--</i>

01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,380

1230
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,167
Isn't there some
kind of law
that's protecting him?

1231
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:20,769
Like a double jeopardy
or something like that?

1232
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,509
What's "empanelled" mean?

1233
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,151
But with a motive, then--

1234
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,331
holy shit. Okay.

1235
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,672
Yeah, unless he gave us
that footage out of guilt,

1236
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:59,174
and he wants to confess.

1237
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,216
Okay, thanks a lot,
Patrick, I appreciate it.

1238
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,451
Like hell.

1239
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:11,119
--What do you mean?

1240
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:13,521
Like hell we're gonna give
the footage to the authorities

1241
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:15,824
-and let them handle--
-we're gonna give the footage
to the authorities.

1242
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,392
"We" who?

1243
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:19,227
Us. You and I.

1244
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,662
We're gonna do
the Dwayne interview

1245
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:22,163
because we have
the opportunity to do it.

1246
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:23,631
If you do this, I'm walking.

1247
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:25,733
But we're here to do
the Dwayne interview.

1248
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:27,602
That's the whole point
of this story.

1249
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,404
Get the fuck out
of my way.

1250
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,873
Fuck off.

1251
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,509
-Come on, soldier.
-Yeah, yeah.
This is insane, dude.

1252
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:35,610
What do you mean
this is insane?

1253
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:36,811
This is what
we came here for, man.

1254
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,646
Do you realize
the guy is following us,

1255
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:40,448
and he's a murderer?

1256
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,217
We came here with a purpose.

1257
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:43,718
We are following a story.

1258
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,853
A purpose to stay alive.

1259
01:08:44,855 --> 01:08:46,488
You heard Patrick, all right.

1260
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,856
If he admits to a motive,

1261
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:49,390
he's not protected anymore.

1262
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:51,359
So we're gonna walk away now
after all this time?

1263
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:52,527
Yeah, we're sitting ducks.

1264
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:53,695
We came all this fucking way.

1265
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:55,163
You know what? Fuck you.

1266
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,265
Stop being a pussy.

1267
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,811
<i> Things finally started</i>
<i> to makes sense.</i>

1268
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:12,280
<i> The more I thought about</i>
<i> all the events,</i>

1269
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:15,583
<i>the more I began to comprehend</i>
<i>how Dwayne</i>
<i>got away with murder.</i>

1270
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,623
<i> There was the connection</i>
<i> to Raymond Gibbs and his son.</i>

1271
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,925
<i> But Dwayne killed three boys.</i>

1272
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:25,660
<i> That was the scary part.</i>

1273
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,695
<i> Ingeniously scary.</i>

1274
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,297
<i> If he killed Cody alone,</i>

1275
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:32,233
<i> it's far easier to draw</i>
<i> the lines together.</i>

1276
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:34,169
<i> So he diluted the motive.</i>

1277
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:37,172
<i> Kill Cody, you have murder</i>
<i> and motive.</i>

1278
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:40,708
<i> Kill them all, it's a random</i>
<i> act of violent insanity.</i>

1279
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,685
<i> Adam did have a point.</i>

1280
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,921
<i> I decided to take a copy</i>
<i> of the footage</i>

1281
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:55,757
<i> and a letter to the cops,</i>
<i> in case anything happened.</i>

1282
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,932
<i> When I started</i>
<i> this documentary,</i>

1283
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:06,834
<i> it was a passion project</i>
<i> based on a crazy story.</i>

1284
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,470
<i> It's not a story,</i>
<i> it's a tragedy.</i>

1285
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:11,706
<i> But I never thought</i>
<i> it would lead to this.</i>

1286
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,975
<i> I never though I would</i>
<i> fear for my life.</i>

1287
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:16,978
That's it, right there.

1288
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,758
When I get there,
shut that down.

1289
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:33,695
He was very,
very adamant about...

1290
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,666
The fact that he'll tell us
where to set up and what to do.

1291
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,470
You all right?

1292
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:43,638
I'm fine.

1293
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,274
Okay.

1294
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:47,408
I know you don't wanna be here.

1295
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,543
Dude, I'm fine.

1296
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,650
Jesus! Where the fuck
does this man live?

1297
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,260
All right. Shut it off.

1298
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:07,495
Let's do this.

1299
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,302
Where's your camera guy?

1300
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:15,403
It's just me and you.

1301
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:20,675
Okay.

1302
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,879
This isn't an interview, is it?

1303
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,286
No, it's not.

1304
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:33,921
-Where is your son?
-Oh...

1305
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,796
Just leave my son out of this.

1306
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,700
Okay, you've got
something to say,

1307
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:47,035
so why don't you just say it?

1308
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:48,469
You don't need me here.

1309
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,072
It's not true. I do need you.

1310
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,608
Why?

1311
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,643
I think that if you
see something

1312
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,980
that is completely
wrong and unjust,

1313
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,451
you have a philosophical

1314
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,453
moral obligation
to speak up against it,

1315
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:06,721
even if you cannot change it.

1316
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,826
You've seen my film.

1317
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,464
Yeah.

1318
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,901
I've seen
a lot of things, Julian.

1319
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:22,870
And nothing's changed.

1320
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,072
But an eye for an eye?

1321
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,341
Is that really your answer?

1322
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,409
Are you even now with Raymond?

1323
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:29,677
Oh...

1324
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,847
If...

1325
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,516
If a child is ripped away
from you like that...

1326
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,787
There's no replacing it.

1327
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:42,824
There's no eye for an eye.

1328
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,795
But you are a murderer now.

1329
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,064
I didn't ask to be
a part of it.

1330
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:54,902
But as I man,

1331
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,042
as a husband and as a father,
you do what's necessary.

1332
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,618
You found it necessary

1333
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,787
to kill three innocent boys?

1334
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,858
These people get away
with murder every day.

1335
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,162
Hell, you made documentaries
about it.

1336
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,833
But you're
just sitting there...

1337
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:27,168
You're sitting there
and you're judging me,

1338
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:28,469
just like everyone else.

1339
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,605
Those people, they...

1340
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,608
They manipulate the laws.

1341
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,413
And you can speak up,
you can...

1342
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:39,947
You can protest.

1343
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,184
It doesn't matter.

1344
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,656
I'm just the first guy
to play their...

1345
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:49,757
Their game by their rules.

1346
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,027
Are you saying
that you planned

1347
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,596
and carried out the murder
of Raymond Gibbs' son?

1348
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,098
Julian, I'm saying

1349
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,200
Raymond Gibbs hasn't
suffered enough.

1350
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,538
It still doesn't hide the fact

1351
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,939
that you killed Thomas Burnett

1352
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,041
and David drabeck.

1353
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,510
Do you think I'm a monster?

1354
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,679
You murdered three boys.

1355
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:13,815
And you filmed it.

1356
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,521
Yeah, I watch that film
every day.

1357
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,628
I watch that film every day.

1358
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,133
Because if I didn't,

1359
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,136
I would not have
the strength to...

1360
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,015
Okay, Dwayne, we'll take
a break if you want.

1361
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,585
Dwayne!

1362
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:51,786
Dwayne! Jesus!

1363
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:53,654
--Fuck!

1364
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:56,491
Dwayne! Oh, shit! Adam!

1365
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:57,925
Dwayne?

1366
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,861
Dwayne?

1367
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:01,095
Holy shit.

1368
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,231
Oh!

1369
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,535
Holy shit, dude.

1370
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:08,870
- Call an ambulance.
-Are you okay?

1371
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:09,937
Call an ambulance.

1372
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:11,072
I am, I am.

1373
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:12,673
What the fuck.
His kid's in the back.

1374
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:15,142
What did you do, man?

1375
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,120
<i> ...camera guy?</i>

1376
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,255
<i> It's just you and me.</i>

1377
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:31,926
<i> That's good.</i>

1378
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,729
<i>This isn't an interview, is it?</i>

1379
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,299
<i> No, it's not.</i>

1380
01:15:38,301 --> 02:31:16,600
<i> Are you saying that--</i>

1381
01:15:38,301 --> 02:31:16,600
<i> I wanted something good</i>
<i> to come from this.</i>

1382
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,805
<i> I thought that I would</i>
<i> find it in the truth.</i>

1383
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:47,542
<i> Raymond Gibbs</i>
<i> hasn't suffered enough.</i>

1384
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:50,044
<i> Some people</i>
<i> congratulated me on</i>
<i> getting to Dwayne.</i>

1385
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,846
<i> Cornering him into the truth.</i>

1386
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,181
- Jesus! Fuck!

1387
01:15:55,217 --> 02:31:50,433
<i> Dwayne! Holy shit! Adam!</i>

1388
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:58,286
<i> But there's more to it</i>
<i> than that.</i>

1389
01:15:58,288 --> 01:15:59,654
<i> Dwayne?</i>

1390
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,589
<i> Dwayne?</i>

1391
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:02,857
<i> Holy shit.</i>

1392
01:16:03,625 --> 02:32:07,249
<i> Oh!</i>

1393
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:10,197
<i> Holy shit, dude!</i>
<i> Are you okay?</i>

1394
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,132
<i> Call an ambulance.</i>

1395
01:16:11,134 --> 02:32:22,266
<i> I am, I am.</i>

1396
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:13,935
<i> What the fuck.</i>
<i> His kid's in the back.</i>

1397
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:19,974
<i> Dwayne's son</i>
<i> had died two months earlier.</i>

1398
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:22,843
<i> About the same time I had</i>
<i> received the anonymous email</i>

1399
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:24,612
<i>about the yellowstone murders.</i>

1400
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,114
<i> Losing his son</i>

1401
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,316
<i> was the final straw.</i>

1402
01:16:28,318 --> 01:16:31,752
<i> Dwayne was clinging</i>
<i> to his son's life</i>

1403
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,321
<i> more than he was</i>
<i> clinging to his own.</i>

1404
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,661
<i> When I returned home,</i>
<i> I had another email</i>

1405
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:42,096
<i> from chasingbison bear.</i>

1406
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,266
<i> No subject, no message.</i>

1407
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,936
<i> That image was always</i>
<i> a metaphor for me.</i>

1408
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,039
<i>The chase through yellowstone.</i>

1409
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:54,675
<i> But I never fully understood</i>
<i> if I was the bear,</i>

1410
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:56,310
<i> or if I was the bison.</i>

1411
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:58,112
<i> The hunter or the hunted.</i>

1412
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,682
<i> Now I realize I was neither.</i>

1413
01:17:01,684 --> 01:17:02,950
<i> I was just the guy</i>
<i> with the camera,</i>

1414
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,018
<i> who captured the story.</i>

1415
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,325
<i> ...or whatever.</i>
<i> And Dwayne...</i>

1416
01:17:11,327 --> 02:34:22,652
<i> Dwayne and bear,</i>

1417
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:14,829
<i> they went in</i>
<i> pretty much all the time.</i>

1418
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,031
<i> Sorry, "bear"?</i>

1419
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:19,734
<i>Bear, yeah. Barry was his dad.</i>

1420
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,769
<i> Yeah.</i>

1421
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:23,371
Dad's just a...

1422
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:25,973
<i> Barry was his dad.</i>

1423
01:17:26,341 --> 02:34:52,681
<i> Yeah.</i>

1424
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:30,044
<i> Unlike me, Dwayne actually</i>
<i> looked up to his father.</i>

1425
01:17:31,179 --> 02:35:02,357
<i> I should have</i>
<i> paid more attention</i>

1426
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,248
<i> to the email address</i>
<i> from the beginning.</i>

1427
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:39,020
<i> Two names appear under</i>
<i> the handle "bison Barry".</i>

1428
01:17:39,022 --> 01:17:43,257
<i> One, a sports director</i>
<i> from a university</i>
<i> radio station in Cleveland,</i>

1429
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:47,194
<i> the other a part time writer</i>
<i> for the west yellowstone</i>
<i> newspaper</i>

1430
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:48,963
<i> back in the '70s.</i>

1431
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:51,866
<i> His full name,</i>
<i> Barry Robert Nelson.</i>

1432
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:54,101
<i> Father to Dwayne Nelson.</i>

1433
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:57,438
<i>What caught my eye most</i>
<i>was one article in particular,</i>

1434
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,306
<i> written back in 1978.</i>

1435
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,743
<i> "Idaho - population zero."</i>

1436
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,747
<i>...as the yellowstone murderer</i>
<i>was found dead in his home</i>

1437
01:18:06,749 --> 02:36:13,496
<i> early this morning.</i>

1438
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:10,685
<i> Police have yet to reveal</i>
<i> the full details</i>
<i> surrounding his death,</i>

1439
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,887
<i> but early reports</i>
<i> suggests suicide.</i>

1440
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,321
<i> The whole time,</i>
<i> I believed that Dwayne</i>

1441
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:16,057
<i> wanted to admit the truth.</i>

1442
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:18,926
<i>But as way to cleanse his soul.</i>

1443
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:21,729
<i> Now I know that this was</i>
<i> all part of his plan.</i>

1444
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:23,998
<i> Everything from the get go</i>
<i> had been on his terms.</i>

1445
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,232
<i> Everything.</i>

1446
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,034
<i> The murders, the loophole.</i>

1447
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,202
<i> Even this film.</i>

1448
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,005
<i> He wanted revenge, he got it.</i>

1449
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:33,741
<i>He wanted the truth out there,</i>
<i>he got that, too.</i>

1450
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:36,444
<i> He used me,</i>
<i> he used the justice system,</i>

1451
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:37,812
<i> he used us all.</i>

1452
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,321
<i>I struggled a lot with whether</i>
<i>I should release this film,</i>

1453
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:49,990
<i> and whose story</i>
<i> I was trying to tell.</i>

1454
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:51,859
<i> I wanted something good</i>
<i> to come from this.</i>

1455
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,929
<i>I thought that I would find it</i>
<i>in the truth.</i>

1456
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:57,264
<i> The truth was worse.</i>

1457
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,902
<i>One man picked a fight with</i>
<i>a multi-million dollar company,</i>

1458
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,805
<i> whose fracking process</i>
<i> was poisoning his home</i>

1459
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:06,073
<i> and killing his family.</i>

1460
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:08,976
<i> But nobody won here.</i>

1461
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:11,212
<i> Not at the expense</i>
<i> of a man's life,</i>

1462
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:14,448
<i> his family's,</i>
<i> and three young men.</i>

1463
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,218
<i> I think there's a lot more</i>
<i> to it than even</i>
<i> Dwayne's letting on.</i>

1464
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,254
<i>You know, maybe something that</i>

1465
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,789
<i> can shed a better light.</i>

1466
01:19:24,993 --> 02:38:49,985
<i> That's Dwayne.</i>

1467
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:29,230
<i> He's just gonna bottle it up</i>
<i> and tell you what you need.</i>

1468
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,199
<i> Bye bye.</i>

1469
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:33,367
<i> Okay.</i>

1470
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,236
<i> -Muah!</i>
<i> -Muah!</i>

1471
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:36,804
<i> I love you, dada.</i>

1472
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:38,472
<i> Love you, dada.</i>

1473
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:39,840
<i> Oh, so sweet.</i>

1474
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,978
<i> The fact that he</i>
<i> could kill those three boys</i>

1475
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,412
<i> seems unreal to me.</i>

1476
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,215
<i> But...</i>

1477
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:51,152
<i> You know, you put a man</i>
<i> through what he went through,</i>

1478
01:19:51,154 --> 01:19:53,320
<i> I guess everybody would</i>
<i> have a breaking point, so...</i>

1479
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,102
<i> Yellowstone national park.</i>

1480
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,572
<i> Around every corner</i>
<i> is a reminder</i>

1481
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:13,507
<i> of how still life can be.</i>

1482
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,343
<i> How vast it can be.</i>

1483
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,848
<i> How true it can be.</i>

1484
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,884
<i> Until it isn't.</i>
