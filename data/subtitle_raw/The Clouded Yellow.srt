I have no passport.

00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,278
I see

12
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,518
I expect you'd like to see 
the airport's code(?)officer

13
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,504
Yes, thank you and
I know the way

14
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,396
Hello, Mac.

15
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,437
Good Morning, Sir. I'll tell
Mr. Chubb that you're here.

16
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,631
Good.

17
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,713
Mr. Somers is here,Sir.

18
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,715
Yes,Sir

19
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,236
Yes ,yes

20
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,197
- He'll see you now,Sir
- Thank you, Mac.

21
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,350
You managed to get out ?

22
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,676
Only just

23
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,795
So I heard

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,836
You used the emergency route, why?

25
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,838
I had too,the frontier was blocked,...

26
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,992
besides I had a bit of trouble

27
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,065
And?

28
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:07,173
No, I've got a rib strap up
 but it will be all right

29
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:12,613
Same old room,
nothing changes.

30
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:15,425
But people do

31
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,404
They get old you know

32
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:21,188
Of course there are some 
jobs where it doesn't matter

33
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:23,111
My job,for instance

34
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:25,645
Not mine.

35
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:31,480
How was I to know that Mark Bamm 
was going to change his mind halfway?

36
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:33,590
There was a time when you'd sensed it

37
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,199
And brought Bamm safely back.

38
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,795
Anyway I got Mark Bamm in the end

39
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,698
You were responsible from then

40
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,055
I know I was.I'm very sorry.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,709
Let's see, you
joined us in 1939

42
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,596
In 1940, parachuted into Bavaria.

43
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,469
Captured by the Gestapo, interrogated.

44
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,750
He escaped with Professor Jacob Werner

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,955
Yes, 1942, Paris.liaison Darrieux.

46
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,110
Returned Germany

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
and escaped with Professor 
Karl Cesare and wife

48
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,231
From 44 to 45 in charge of contra espionage
UK Northern Area

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,789
Headquarters,Liverpool

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,839
Hamburg, details
of mine defences.

51
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,890
Yes.

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,359
Yes,quite a good record...

53
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,869
...until now.

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,873
Aren't I allowed one mistake?

55
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,470
No

56
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,590
I see

57
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,394
What happens now?

58
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,629
The way you came in...

59
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,078
You are not a regular.You'd had 
to go sooner or later anyway.

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,032
I used to be a newspaper man once.

61
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,188
Do you think there'd be any future in the
real life story of the secret service?

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,468
I should think of a very short
 future, Major Somers.

63
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,956
Very short.

64
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,633
You got a little money,haven't you?

65
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,679
Well, then forget all this 
go back to real life again.

66
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,790
Real?

67
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,474
And how do I start?

68
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,279
Well,to begin with stop carrying a gun

69
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,078
You're going to miss me, you know.

70
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,151
I am one of the
best men you got

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,877
Had is the operative word,old boy.

72
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,410
You ought to start something
think about a jump for yourself

73
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,913
Something quiet, in the country.

74
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,679
I might be able to help you

75
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,751
So that you can keep tabs on me

76
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,279
Something like that,yeah

77
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:37,774
There will be decoration for you,
of course,you wouldn't mind that

78
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:40,205
What for,missing van?

79
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:42,739
No,for the time you didn't miss

80
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,853
Oh, very touching.

81
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,755
Down right sad

82
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,990
Good bye, Sir.

83
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,035
Good bye, David.

84
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,516
And thanks.

85
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,179
Get Mr.Shepley.

86
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:21,163
Hello, Shepley.Remember what 
I told you about Somers?

87
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:22,714
He just left.

88
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,717
- Same for me.
- Thank you.

89
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,191
Oh, my dear fellow

90
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:30,298
Back, again?

91
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,115
Marvellous life.

92
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:34,319
Always fancy myself 
as a newspaper man

93
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,580
If only didn't get so tiled

94
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,673
What do you do for a living,Willy?

95
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:41,674
Nothing, old boy.They never 
found anything to suit me.

96
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:43,045
Pity

97
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,256
That's what my old man's thinks

98
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,653
- How's the pen pushing?
- Rotten,I'm looking for a job.

99
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,104
Terrible life, isn't it?
Cheers.

100
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,733
So apart from your languages and
 this newspaper work that you did once

101
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:59,888
You have no qualifications 
at all, Major Somers.

102
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,397
Mr. Somers.

103
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,265
So,sorry,some officers like to retain the

104
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:06,386
Yes,yes I know

105
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,396
Well, we must see what we have for you

106
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,829
I suppose you haven't 
working knowledge

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,399
of commercial Portuguese?

108
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,592
No,I'm afraid I haven't

109
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,029
Well, there's is one here.

110
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:31,379
I don't miss recommend it, I
just mentioned in passing.

111
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,415
Why is it dangerous?

112
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,548
Oh,not at all, not exactly.

113
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,029
I think I should tell you we 
had greatest difficulties

114
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,659
in even getting people to consider it

115
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,695
What is the job?

116
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,072
Cataloguing butterflies.

117
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,332
Do I have to know anything about them?

118
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:49,332
Well,no

119
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,538
The only mentioned(?) qualifications
 seems to be..

120
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,636
... a sound general education
and an amiable disposition.

121
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,240
-You appear to have both if I may say so
-Thank you

122
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,254
But I think I must point
 out that, in our opinion,...

123
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,933
... there is very little future in it

124
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,176
Butterflies.

125
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,091
Well, I could think about it,I suppose

126
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,049
Yes, I'm afraid that's
what they all say

127
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,491
- Hello,Willy, have a drink?
- Hello old boy,thanks.

128
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,779
-How's the job hunting?
-Fine,all fixed up,I'm celebrating

129
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,609
-What will you have-Scotch?
-Two whiskeys please

130
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,378
Hello Chubb? Shepley here

131
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,419
He is fixed up.

132
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,318
Yes, all OK

133
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,510
Nice quiet family,nice quiet place.

134
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,504
Cataloguing butterflies.

135
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,163
I'm looking for a house
called White Lodge.

136
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,290
Yes,I know

137
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,073
- Do you know it?
- Yeah, I know it.

138
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,329
Do you mind telling
me how to get there?

139
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:55,755
I'll do better that that

140
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,850
I'll show you.

141
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,989
I'm going there myself.

142
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:00,909
That's jolly decent of you.

143
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,888
-Do you know the Fentons?
- No,and you?

144
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,819
Yes, in a manner of speaking

145
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,219
-What manner would that be?
-You'd better ask the Fentons.

146
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,054
Everyone knows me around here

147
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,952
That'll be your personality, of course.

148
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,623
Are you the chap that's come and help
with the butterflies?

149
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,736
That's right

150
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,415
Nice part of the country this

151
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,676
If you stick to the butterflies.

152
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,547
Codius Croceus

153
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,259
Clouded yellow

154
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,291
Where's Sophie?

155
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,372
Oh Jess, the light, you're 
blocking the light

156
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,566
Nicholas, do stop for a minute
 and listen to me.

157
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,134
I always listen to you, my dear.

158
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,160
I can do almost anything and at
the same time and still listen to you.

159
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,246
Nicholas, I'm serious.

160
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,982
Jess, let's have peace.

161
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,000
Where's Sophie?

162
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,305
Over in the far meadow trying
to find clouded yellows.

163
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,451
Why?

164
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,163
Well, this man who is coming,this Somers

165
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,438
He must be warned about her.

166
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,366
I'm afraid,my dear,that's
 a little unnecessary.

167
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,740
What should he be warned about?

168
00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:07,552
After all he's just a young man who's 
coming to stay with us and do a little work

169
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,295
You know Sophie just as well as I do.

170
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,367
But I really don't see what could happen

171
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,455
A local young man I can deal with 
.

172
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:15,187
but this is something quite different

173
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,656
Somebody here living in the house

174
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,483
Oh,no don't let's start 
of imagining things.

175
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,549
I don't like a stranger here 
talking to Sophie...

176
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,814
 asking her questions.

177
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:25,169
You'd no business to arrange 
it without consulting me.

178
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,034
Well, I'm sorry,my dear but it's done now.

179
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,198
I'm David Somers.

180
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,259
Makes a nice change to come
round to the front door

181
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,759
I've brought you a couple of rabbits
 for you, Mrs.Fenton.

182
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:51,811
-Take them around to the back, will you
-Anything you say,Mrs Fenton

183
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,064
-How do you do
-How do you do

184
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,805
I'm so pleased to meet you.

185
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,189
I think my husband is here

186
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,322
Nicholas, this is Mr. Somers.

187
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,870
- How do you,Sir
- How are you

188
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,563
I see you've done making friends already

189
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,138
Hick is quite well known 
round here,isn't he dear?

190
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,478
-I'll tell Addie to bring your bags
-Thank you.

191
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:10,701
- I'll show you where to put the car.
- Thank you,Sir

192
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:15,939
Come in.

193
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,494
Hello sir.

194
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:19,997
Our Addie has brought 
up your bags,I see

195
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,510
Please go on.

196
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:24,107
Usually she has to be told
things twice..

197
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,898
You must have made an impression on her

198
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,825
BTW there is a bigger room at the 
back of the house,if you prefer it

199
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:31,137
This is the one that has 
a view of the garden.

200
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,365
This is perfect, thank you,Sir

201
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,212
Good,well, I hope you'll be comfortable.

202
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,429
I'm sure I shall

203
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:38,914
If you don't mind my saying 
so you hardly seem to be

204
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,598
the sort of man that.

205
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,760
- Want to catalogue butterflies?
- Well yes.

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,009
Of course you made it quite clear in
 your letter that you were not interested

207
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,632
in the butterflies as such ..

208
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,477
but I can't help wondering
what attracted you to the job

209
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,191
Your references were
really excellent.

210
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,633
They did make it clear to you it was only
temporary,did they?

211
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,735
Oh yes,they did,Sir

212
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:03,219
It's simply that I got rather tired
of people and cities...

213
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,964
Well, the thought of two three
months doing something quiet...

214
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,574
peaceful in the country seemed
 to me just what I wanted

215
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,232
Yes I understand.

216
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:15,667
A convalescence of the mind

217
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,137
peace

218
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:18,923
That's what we all strive for,don't we?

219
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,311
I well understand

220
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,875
-I hope you'll be happy.
-Thank you sir.

221
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,954
We are very quiet here there is
just my wife and myself

222
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,772
... and my wife's niece.

223
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:34,049
I feel perhaps I ought to

224
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,976
tell you something about Sophie.

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,326
Your wife's niece?

226
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,715
Yes,we're her guardians

227
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,682
She has not had a very happy
life and may find her a

228
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,954
... a little strange
in certain respects.

229
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:47,140
Well I thought I just tell you that...

230
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:49,999
She is a sweet child but
she is very highly strung.

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,845
She isn't always quite reasonable
in the things she says.

232
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,257
Jess,my wife,understands her

233
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,844
Please don't think too much about it,
but I thought I let you know

234
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,921
I'll remember,Sir

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,558
Well.,that's that

236
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:04,932
Tea will be a little late today.

237
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,864
My wife always go down to 
Tapgrove on Tuesdays and Fridays

238
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,566
... so it will be five o'clock
instead of half past four

239
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:11,968
Well, I'll leave you to it.

240
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,124
If there is anything you want 
you will ring ,won't you?

241
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:16,189
Yes thank you

242
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,231
I can't promise that Addie 
will answer the bell.

243
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,774
... But it's always worth trying.

244
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,503
-Five o'clock downstairs,I'll see you then
- Fine thank you,Sir

245
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:46,238
I'm sorry.I'm very sorry,

246
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:47,893
I thought you'd gone down to the village.

247
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:50,301
I don't

248
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,184
Who are you?

249
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,492
My name is Somers.
David Somers.

250
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,591
Are you the one is going to do
the butterflies for Nicholas?

251
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:07,826
That's right

252
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:09,906
You must be Mrs. Fenton's niece

253
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,731
Yes.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,122
How do you do

255
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:16,396
How do you do

256
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,418
You play very well, Miss Sophie.

257
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:21,494
Do I?

258
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,093
Jess hates me to play

259
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,625
I thought you were
Jess when you came in.

260
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:27,399
I see

261
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:32,881
Are you a doctor?

262
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,698
No, I'm not a doctor.

263
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,564
And you haven't come here to explain
to me that I get things muddled and wrong

264
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,450
No, I came to help
with the butterflies.

265
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:46,801
That's what Jess said.

266
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:48,576
But it's true.

267
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,416
There was a doctor who 
came here once before

268
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,731
Yes.

269
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:58,826
- You think I'm very foolish,don't you?
-Oh,no, I don't

270
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:01,861
They asked me down to tea...

271
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,645
can you tell me where 
they have it?

272
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:04,904
On the terrace.

273
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:06,174
Thank you.

274
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,316
I'm sorry I disturbed your playing

275
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,628
Jess is back, so I couldn't go on anyway

276
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,877
What a pity.

277
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:14,817
Mr. Somers...

278
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,375
You won't tell Jess what
I said to you, will you?

279
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,813
No, I won't

280
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,827
Good Morning Sir

281
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,243
-Good Morning Addie
-Good Morning

282
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,408
Here is the list of my collection,you 
see how it goes,it's in alphabetical order

283
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,985
It tallies with the butterflies
 in these trays

284
00:16:57,452 --> 00:16:58,872
And with those over there

285
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,873
And here are the reference books

286
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:03,161
I'll just muddle through this morning

287
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:04,621
That's right see how you get on

288
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:08,554
and BTW when you push these 
trays in again will you do it very gently?

289
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:11,913
If they jar too much it
 harms the specimens

290
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,114
I'll be careful

291
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,314
Good

292
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:16,599
And if you want me I shall be 
just outside in the garden

293
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:17,882
Right,Sir,thank you

294
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,287
I told you not to come to
this part of the house.

295
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,855
I don't mind which part
of the house I come to.

296
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,538
Why can't I still come to you?

297
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,292
Because I like it better here.

298
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,325
I like the view

299
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,556
Get out of here before
I call my husband.

300
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,690
You should have called
him a long time ago...

301
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,129
... if you were to call him at all

302
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,212
Jim, sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

303
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:13,336
I didn't really,please.

304
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,990
Please.

305
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,238
Got any honey to spare?

306
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,569
What are you doing here?

307
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,176
Do not be so high and mighty

308
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,733
Why do not you relax a bit?

309
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,410
Don't you like me?

310
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,219
All the other girls do

311
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,213
You have no right to be here.

312
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,650
Go away.

313
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,576
That's not very friendly.

314
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,215
Give me my comb.

315
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,530
Say please.

316
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,691
Please.

317
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,932
No,not friendly enough.

318
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,535
Well, I can't get any honey
and I can't get friendly so

319
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,695
... I'll keep this.

320
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,496
Hick!

321
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,956
Hick!

322
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,296
Something matter?

323
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,654
He's taken my comb.

324
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,739
Is he a friend of yours,too?

325
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,270
I don't know.

326
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,775
He does stupid things.

327
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,009
What's Hick been up to?

328
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,516
Nothing

329
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,973
Well, I'll get back to my butterflies.

330
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,812
I should avoid Hick if I were you child

331
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:53,332
I do.

332
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,493
How long is Mr. Somers going to stay here?

333
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,629
A month or two.

334
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,263
I like him.

335
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:02,349
I shouldn't say so

336
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,411
Not to your aunt.

337
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,773
Well,I wouldn't,not to Jess

338
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,179
I must get another comb.

339
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,256
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,208
I'm sorry, I forgot.

341
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,610
Forgot? You do it purposely.

342
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,858
- No I don't
- Don't you lie to me.

343
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,730
Mr. Somers,I didn't 
see you standing there

344
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,888
I'm really very sorry.

345
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,019
Sophie,please go

346
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,054
I expect you think I'm
very unkind to Sophie.

347
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,696
Well,it's none of my business, Mrs.
Fenton.

348
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,179
But you must be
thinking it.

349
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,667
That was her father's 
music she was playing.

350
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,510
Her father?

351
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,571
It was George Malraux, the composer.

352
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,830
Malraux?

353
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,255
Didn't he shoot himself and his wife?

354
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,049
She was my sister.

355
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,132
The marriage was hopeless from the start

356
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,454
But why the suicide?

357
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,259
He was unbalanced.

358
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,734
He needed someone strong
who could understand him.

359
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,256
Sophie was only six
when it happened.

360
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,890
It was dreadful

361
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,250
You see, she found them.

362
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,013
When Nicholas and I arrived...

363
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,533
She was kneeling by her
mother, she bent over her...

364
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,013
... and it was blood in her hair

365
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,235
How dreadful

366
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,990
Mr. Somers, I have to tell you this

367
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,770
Sophie is like her father...

368
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,295
... and it is very bad for her
to be reminded of the past.

369
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,179
We have to watch her.She 
 get things twisted and wrong

370
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,654
It can be dangerous.

371
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,933
She's right,I do get things muddled

372
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,012
We've all get muddled sometimes

373
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,076
Good Morning.

374
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,470
Good Morning.

375
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,438
I was happy to see you Sophie

376
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,831
Why?

377
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,398
I have an apology to make to you.

378
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,239
You mean about last night?

379
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,597
- It was not your fault.
- No

380
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,273
You once told me that your Aunt
would not let you play the piano...

381
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,194
... and I didn't believe you

382
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,370
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,669
You are very kind,Mr Somers

384
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,239
No, it's not that

385
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,910
It's just that I suddenly
realized how very lonely you must be.

386
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,997
You never go out and nobody
ever comes here.

387
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,215
Except Hick.

388
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,110
Yes,but you haven't really  
got any friends,have you?

389
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,437
No

390
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,069
Or relatives apart from Mr. and Mrs.
Fenton?

391
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,755
When you always been alone,
you get used to it

392
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,279
Oh,is that quite true?

393
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,504
No,it isn't.

394
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,309
It's nearly true.

395
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,995
You wouldn't know

396
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,918
I know what it is like to be alone.

397
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,178
And I know what
despair can feel like too

398
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,356
Do you ?

399
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,671
Even the sun looks Gray.

400
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,915
And self pity is such a dreary thing

401
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,971
you despise yourself and wonders if 
it matters if you go on living or not

402
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,110
Yes I know.

403
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,229
Sophie, would you let me help you?

404
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,016
Help me?

405
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,555
Now I've got you.

406
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,625
No, I can shut you out

407
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,756
Sophie!

408
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,079
Sophie,where are you?

409
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,690
It's your move

410
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,716
Sophie!

411
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,468
That's the idea.

412
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,931
Yes,you're really doing a very good job.

413
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,831
Far more quickly than I could

414
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,439
It's a practical mind.

415
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,911
I started a catalogue three times...

416
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,640
... but always when I come
to one of my old favourites...

417
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,071
I stopped and think how I caught it.

418
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,419
Yeah, I know and then you're lost.

419
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,694
How well you understand

420
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,139
You have become a quite
stabilizing influence...

421
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,952
... during the weeks
you've been here.

422
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,033
I shall be very sorry 
when you have to leave us.

423
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,924
I shall be very sorry too,Sir,
I've been very happy here.

424
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,096
I'm glad

425
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,016
Got it

426
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,556
Silver-washed, see them all over the place.

427
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,028
All right, fly away.

428
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,598
Don't you ever get tired of butterflies?

429
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,369
I get tired of people first

430
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,455
Well of course.

431
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,150
But I've only had three weeks
with the butterflies.

432
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,712
What do you do when you
get tired of people?

433
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,755
You can't stick pins
through their middles

434
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,673
I think sometimes I'd like to

435
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,650
Yes, I know that feeling.

436
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,230
What was that?

437
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,296
What?

438
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,074
I thought I heard something cry out.
Yes,there it is again.

439
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,515
Why did you do that?

440
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,275
It was caught in one of
these beastly spring traps

441
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,555
... its legs were broken.

442
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,736
Poor little thing

443
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,949
I hate traps.

444
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,687
What do you think you're playing at?

445
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,894
What are you doing
with that rabbit?

446
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,228
How many of those traps have you got?

447
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,376
About a dozen.

448
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,589
Are you happy with that sort?

449
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,775
I bought them cheap.

450
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,855
Any objections?

451
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,512
I give five pounds for the lot

452
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,118
Well, that suits me fine

453
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,599
And I'll take delivery now

454
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,389
 I can't bring them now,
 I'm meeting someone

455
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,893
- I said now.
-You'd better get them,Hick

456
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,207
Five pounds is certainly 
better than any girl.

457
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,838
Maybe you got something there

458
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,748
I'll bring them round

459
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,070
Hick...

460
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,789
... could I have my comb?

461
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,858
I'll throw it in with the traps

462
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,495
He spoiled it.

463
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,515
I do not want it anymore.

464
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,529
Nice chap

465
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,751
He's one of the people I like to throw away

466
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,670
I'd stick to butterflies if I were you

467
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,949
- You see?
-Well, he brought her back

468
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,741
-That's bad for her.
-Nonsense

469
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,039
There you are, Sophie.

470
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,010
Any luck?

471
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,559
No, only silver-washed

472
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,037
I told Hick not to come here.

473
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,788
I have some work to do.

474
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,911
I'm afraid it's my fault, Mrs Fenton

475
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,230
I've just bought some
 rabbit traps from Hick

476
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,330
Oh,right

477
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,182
He's sorry for the rabbits.

478
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,554
What are you doing
with my knife?

479
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,618
I'll give it back to you later on.

480
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,456
I'll go and collect the traps

481
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,132
Mind you only give him five pounds.

482
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,271
I will.

483
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,713
- Mr. Somers.
- Yes.

484
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,518
He'll try make you give him 
more,I know Hick.

485
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:02,669
So do I

486
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,553
More tea,Sophie?

487
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,475
But I hadn't had any...

488
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,191
You really must remember
what you do, Sophie.

489
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,436
You really must

490
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:16,634
I better go upstairs and change.

491
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,412
There is no one to impress here.

492
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,397
Have you been with Mr 
Somers all the afternoon?

493
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,535
Yes,he likes being with me.

494
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,715
That's because he's kind

495
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,632
You mustn't take advantage of it, Sophie.

496
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,437
- It's nice to have a friend.
-But not for you,it's not safe.

497
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,595
Your father loved your mother,
and you are very like him.

498
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,695
I don't mind

499
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,034
I want to be like him.

500
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:44,998
Oh, Mrs. Fenton.

501
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,475
Hick asked me to give you this.

502
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,611
He said it was his bill

503
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,702
Oh! Thank you.Thank you Mr. Somers.

504
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,370
Mr. Fenton, Mr. Fenton!

505
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,516
What's it, Addie?

506
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,616
- It's Hick,he's dead.
- What?

507
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,054
Down by the stables.

508
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,611
There's a knife in his
back,it's horrible

509
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,897
I saw him lying there,I saw the knife.
who could have done it?

510
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,489
You must have been seeing things.

511
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,482
Somers,go with her,like 
a good fellow,will you

512
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:47,982
Let's see what this is all about.

513
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,234
I'll put on a coat

514
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,950
He's dead all right

515
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,291
You'd better send for the
police, Somers.

516
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,176
Yes,Sir

517
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,219
Come back into the house,Jess.

518
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,492
I'm all right, Nicholas.

519
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,774
Sure we'll have to remember where
we were when he was killed.

520
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,853
You, I, Addie, Somers.

521
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,788
Sophie.

522
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,898
She'll have to remember too.

523
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,152
All right, Mr. Somers,thank you very much.

524
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:49,522
Perhaps,you'd be good enough 
to send Ms Malraux in now?

525
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:50,704
Very well, Inspector.

526
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,032
Yes, Mr. Somers?

527
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,953
I know this is none of
my business, Inspector.

528
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,874
... but the girl is likely
 to be a bit nervous

529
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,230
I wouldn't get too much 
by appearances,that's all

530
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,574
That's all right, Mr. Somers.

531
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,052
It'll just be the facts that count

532
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,855
Right,I'll get her

533
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,519
Yes,I'd like to know something more
about Mr. Somers.

534
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,678
I bet he's talked to the girl already 
this morning,so it can't be helped

535
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,991
You know these people,Stuart, what 
do you think of Mrs.Fenton's evidence?

536
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,912
I think she's trying
to protect the girl,Sir

537
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,983
You noticed

538
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,398
She didn't really want to tell us 
about seeing her go out

539
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:24,498
in the middle of the night.

540
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,789
I think she's too honest not to

541
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,896
Yes, and she tried to hide the girl's coat.

542
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,693
It's beginning to look like an
open and shut case all right

543
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,914
Sit down, Miss Malraux.

544
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,151
I just like to ask
you a few questions.

545
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,651
That is if you are prepared
to answer them of course

546
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,789
I don't know anything.

547
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,754
Last night..

548
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,755
... did you go out at all?

549
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,771
Out?

550
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,074
Yes,Miss Malraux, out

551
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,109
Out of this house.

552
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:01,715
Yes, I think I did.

553
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,815
Aren't you sure?

554
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,810
Yes, I did go out

555
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,108
What time would that be?

556
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,719
I don't know, in the night.

557
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,096
- Where did you go to?
- To the wood, by the church meadow

558
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,354
And why did you do that?

559
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,673
Was it to meet someone?

560
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,356
No

561
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,610
-You knew this man,Hick,didn't you?
-Yes, I knew him.

562
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,079
- Did you like him?
-No, I didn't

563
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,515
But I didn't kill him.

564
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,159
Was it to meet Hick

565
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,614
that you went out to the wood
at three o'clock this morning?

566
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,258
-No,it was to get my comb
- Your comb?

567
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,739
I left it at the edge of the wood

568
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,398
Hick had spoiled it so I left it there.

569
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,971
And so in the middle of the
night you put on your coat...

570
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,634
and went to get a comb you'd
left in the wood. Is that it?

571
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,771
Yes.

572
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,299
-Will you show me the comb,Miss Malraux
-I haven't got it,I couldn't find it

573
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,197
-Had Hick taken it again?
- No

574
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,352
I get things muddled, I get 
things wrong way around

575
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,671
You're like Jess trying to confuse me.

576
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,391
We're not trying to confuse 
you,Miss Malraux.

577
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,473
We only want the facts.

578
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,237
Bur I was angry because
he took my comb.

579
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,914
Yeah, well, we are back to 
the comb again,Miss Malraux

580
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,233
This comb that you went out to look for
this morning and couldn't find,...

581
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:24,494
... what exactly was it like?

582
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,639
I brought it from France,
it belonged to my mother

583
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,437
Yes, Miss Malraux, but what was it like?

584
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,639
Was it like that for instance?

585
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,370
Yes, it was.

586
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,235
That's my knife.

587
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,672
That belonged to my mother too.

588
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,028
I see, Miss Malraux.

589
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:54,855
That'll be all for now, 
thank you very much.

590
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,360
I'll have to ask you not
 to leave the house,if you don't mind

591
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,287
I'll think we should be wanting you for 
questioning a little later on.

592
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,393
They want to see you again, Jess.

593
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,095
Well child?

594
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,635
Sophie

595
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,716
What happened?

596
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,871
They think I killed him
just because of my comb.

597
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,515
Where did you get it?

598
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,076
You told me that you could
not find it last night

599
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,774
But I found it,it was in the
wood where you dropped it

600
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,592
I couldn't find it,not in the dark.

601
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,909
I had no no light with me

602
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,717
You see, I think I didn't think

603
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,437
It was because of a
nightmare I have.

604
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,555
Are you sure?

605
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,715
I think so.

606
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,915
Well, this's one thing the
police won't find.

607
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,515
They've got your coat.

608
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,633
How did the blood get on it?

609
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,111
What blood? I haven't seen my 
coat they took it away

610
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,633
There is a blood stain on it

611
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,950
They found it because Jess tried to hide it

612
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,763
Did Jess try to hide it?

613
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,669
- I remember, she came and took it away
- When?

614
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,478
This morning,after the police came, she
said it had to be cleaned.

615
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,114
David, I'm so frightened.

616
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,669
-You will help me,won't you?
- Yes, of course I will.

617
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,432
But what you really need is a lawyer.

618
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,863
I know the very man.We drive 
up to London this afternoon

619
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:31,532
I can't, the police said I 
wasn't to leave the house.

620
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,729
Oh they did,did they

621
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:34,359
We'll that settles that

622
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,590
Never mind,you listen to me, I'll tell
you what we're going to do.

623
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,792
What's the matter,why
aren't you ready?

624
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,234
I'm not going,David

625
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,630
Do you want to stay
here and get yourself arrested?

626
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,599
I mustn't run away.

627
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,195
Sofie,if things were different,
you'd be right

628
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,996
But not know don't you realize
how strong the case is against you?

629
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,070
I did not kill him.

630
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,390
I know,bur someone trying to
make it look as if you did

631
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,212
- and they are succeeding.
- But who?

632
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,409
Your aunt,perhaps.

633
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,632
Jess would not do that to me.

634
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,998
Besides she was trying to hide the coat.

635
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,534
They found it just the same.

636
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,740
David, perhaps I did kill him and
I can't even remember

637
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:42,879
Of course you didn't kill
him,you couldn't kill him.

638
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,319
So who did ?

639
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,375
I'm not certain

640
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,034
But one thing I know

641
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,319
As long as you're free the
real killer won't feel safe.

642
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,199
Something more has to happen...

643
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,191
... and it is then the killer
make mistakes.

644
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,144
You mustn't help me they'll blame you too.

645
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,510
There is no crime in taking 
someone to see a lawyer

646
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,963
Besides, I hate traps, and I'm
getting you out of this one

647
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,116
I've done a bit before for
people I didn't even know.

648
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,499
So I can do it for

649
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,793
... for someone I love.

650
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,566
And don't you argue anymore

651
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,056
Go back to your room and
get your things ready,quickly

652
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,753
Had you had enough breakfast?

653
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,613
Good,I'll think I'll get along now

654
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,938
Aren't I going with you?

655
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,468
No, Sophie, better
I see Chubb alone first

656
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,118
Really, it's better that way.

657
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,589
Have you any money?

658
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,434
Good,now then, where shall we meet?

659
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,179
Do you know the Holborn underground?

660
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,508
No, but I'll can find it

661
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,770
Fine

662
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,056
Go to the Holborn underground and wait
on the King's Cross platform

663
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,564
... until I come, I'll get there by

664
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:54,564
by ten-thirty.

665
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,831
All right?

666
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,262
Holborn Underground, King's
Cross Platform.

667
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,157
- Good. Bye now

668
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,230
Well, I expected you before this.

669
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,676
I missed my breakfast.

670
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,036
What do you mean?

671
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,151
You've been staying with
Nicholas Fenton...

672
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,117
... at White Lodge,
Tapgrove, Hampshire.

673
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,471
So you did keep tabs on me

674
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,634
I thought Willy was too good to be true.

675
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,355
Do you know Fenton?

676
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,471
No

677
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,330
Do you know his wife?

678
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,430
No

679
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,673
And I don't know her niece.

680
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,558
The girl who is wanted for murder

681
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,115
What is this, Somers?

682
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,472
What makes you think she did it?

683
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,232
The knife, the coat, the cock 
and bull story about the comb..

684
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,674
... the nature of the girl

685
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,718
The aunt been expecting it, blames 
herself for letting it happen.

686
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,119
What are you doing in all this, Somers?

687
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,475
She had the opportunity too,
you forget that,Chubb.

688
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,234
She is on her head, she won't
 hang, they'll shut her up.

689
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,471
But what has that got 
to do with you anywhere

690
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,410
Where did you leave her?

691
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,835
Corner House, Piccadilly
Do you mind if I go myself?

692
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,111
As you like,the police 
will be with you there

693
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,350
They have been waiting
for you since crack of dawn.

694
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,656
Yeah

695
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,716
Catch

696
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,396
It's yours.

697
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,993
It works now.

698
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,436
There she is, overt there in the corner.

699
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,776
You coming over?

700
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,876
No, I'd rather wait outside.

701
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,109
Excuse me Miss.

702
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,872
Hello boys.

703
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,397
Come on.

704
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,831
Excuse me,Miss

705
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,115
They were ahead of us.

706
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,509
- The police?
- Yes.

707
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,478
There's a warrant out for your arrest .

708
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,632
-I should have to go
-No, Sophie.

709
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,994
There is too much against you.

710
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,759
We got to get away

711
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,274
- We're going north.
- How?

712
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,616
By boat.

713
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:52,172
Thank you.

714
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,875
Where are we going?

715
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,950
Newcastle.

716
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,054
Where do go when we get to Newcastle?

717
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,388
China, South America,
you choose.

718
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,878
We can't go abroad just like that

719
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,649
You have to have passports and 
tickets and things don't you?

720
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,995
I've got friends.

721
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,206
You'd be surprised at 
the chums I pick up you know

722
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,155
People will help us?

723
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,232
Yes,people have helped me before.

724
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,352
There are some clothes in there for you,
I bought them in Oxford Street.

725
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:24,379
I hope they fit

726
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,133
You'd better change into them,
there maybe a police description out.

727
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,988
Won't the police be checking
people getting off the boats?

728
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,590
No,they'll be watching 
those leaving the country

729
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,725
... not those coming in.

730
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,459
The trouble is Superintendent, you 
can never tell with these chaps

731
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,274
They are trained to look at
one thing and think another.

732
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,317
Any idea where he might make for,Sir?

733
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,872
Might be anywhere.

734
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,000
Remember that chap has
got contacts all over the place

735
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,193
Our men have a free rein, we
don't ask questions.

736
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,815
Yes,they have some pretty funny 
friends one way or another

737
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,311
Yes,I'm afraid you will have 
your work cut out to find him

738
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,028
If he lasts that long. He has that
girl with him, remember.

739
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,156
I'll tell you what.

740
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,198
I'll lend you someone who knows 
the ropes,if you like.Another agent.

741
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,594
It's very good of you,Sir

742
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,760
No, it isn't,I'm being good to myself

743
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,229
I don't want this department in the news.

744
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:20,282
<i>Scotland Yard has now 
has now been called in</i>

745
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:23,631
<i>for the enquiry into the murder 
at White Lodge,Tapgrove,Hampshire.</i>

746
00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:27,318
<i>The police of five counties are now
looking for a man and a girl.</i>

747
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:30,605
<i>Who,it is thought,may 
be help with the enquiries</i>

748
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,907
We haven't got a chance,have we?

749
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:35,012
Of course we have,don't 
you worry,we'll get away

750
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:37,304
You shouldn't be helping me,
they'll blame you too

751
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:39,822
Sofie,I don't like traps.
Traps of any kind.

752
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,367
Besides, you didn't kill him.

753
00:45:41,368 --> 00:45:42,368
Then who did?

754
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:45,049
I don't know,but we are 
getting time to find out.

755
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,935
If you can the girl at the
same time,so much the better...

756
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,455
... but Somers is our job.Bring him in.

757
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,550
I see

758
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,851
He knows half the secrets
of this department.

759
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,429
He had 18 months on counter-espionage
at the end of the war...

760
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,697
... and knows more ways in and out
of this country than a carrier-pigeon

761
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,629
It might be nice reading for 
the Sunday papers,wouldn't it?

762
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,253
Yes very

763
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,291
This is his history ever since I known him

764
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,253
The answer may be there.

765
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,652
With his experience in the north,
I'd say he'd make for Newcastle.

766
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,176
<i>This is Newcastle.</i>

767
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,409
<i>Passengers from the London train
travelling to Edinburgh...</i>

768
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,333
... should move over to
platform 8.

769
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:49,974
Fares, please.

770
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:57,758
Fares,please

771
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:01,688
Two for Jesmond, please

772
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,173
Thank you.

773
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,350
Get in,Mr. Somers, and the lady

774
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,399
No arguments,get in

775
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,751
Minna,he's here.

776
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,916
Minna

777
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,556
Dear Minna.

778
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,355
I didn't know.

779
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,910
I must be grateful to be here at all.

780
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,557
I'm very happy you came to us.

781
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,236
It was the last thing
I intended to do.

782
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,318
I'm afraid Karl persuaded me.

783
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,835
Karl was right.

784
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,995
Now perhaps we can 
pay a little of our debts

785
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,913
You see,I dare not come back 
to Minna without you

786
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,330
I'm Minna...

787
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,255
... and this is my husband, Karl.

788
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,832
We're friends of Mr. Somers.

789
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,278
And we want to be your friends.

790
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,389
We want to help you.

791
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,634
It's good to have friends.

792
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,154
Professor Werner.

793
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,715
Paul Duclas.

794
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,679
Max Reiner.

795
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,532
And Karl and Minna Cesare

796
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,434
Yes, Cesare

797
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,678
No, just their latest addresses.

798
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,390
And check them on the trains
 to Newcastle,there's a pal

799
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,455
Yes, I'll be here.

800
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,237
Sir.

801
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,909
Good afternoon.

802
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,277
- I want..
-Won't you sit down?

803
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,199
I'll take Pongo.

804
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,497
I give them all names
because they are so many.

805
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,635
Yes of course.

806
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,950
A gentleman has asked me to
call for the red fox.

807
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,198
Is the fox male or female?

808
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,679
The fox is female.

809
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,751
Will it remain with your
friends on this voyage?

810
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,273
Yes, that's the idea.

811
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,114
I'm told that there is
a good market in Mexico City.

812
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,474
Mexico City?

813
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,109
Right, I'll tell my
friend what you say.

814
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,830
Now then, when may I
call for the fox?

815
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,636
My daughter will bring
it to you tonight.

816
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,316
Kyra.

817
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,639
- Kyra is my daughter's name
- Yes Dad?

818
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,478
-Hello!
- Yes...

819
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,948
We've met before.

820
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,749
She will meet you down at the old
steps near Surtees' house.

821
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,991
Good,eleven o'clock?

822
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,394
She will be punctual.

823
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,949
The price of the animal
will be 150 pounds.

824
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,269
Yeah,yeah, it's ridiculous.

825
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,915
Inclusive.

826
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,031
You look very
tired, my friend...

827
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,639
You should take a holiday

828
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,837
Me?

829
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,273
Holiday costs money.

830
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,037
Would a hundred pounds give you
a pleasant weekend at the seaside?

831
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,271
There

832
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,673
Perhaps 125?

833
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,879
I will give it to you.

834
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,791
With your experience, it should be easy.

835
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,957
Yes.

836
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,997
Karl.

837
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,396
It might be easy but it will be expensive.

838
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,510
We grouse this out,we thought
you might need it.

839
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,035
Minna, I knew you would do this,
but I can't take it.

840
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,509
But you must have money,
where were you going to get it?

841
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,656
There are ways.

842
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,869
And take more risks ?

843
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,679
Now where would we be if we
refused your help?

844
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,512
He gave Karl and me our freedom,
now we want to help you

845
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,479
-Don't be silly.
- Thank you, Minna.

846
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,754
I'll see you get it back

847
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,876
We can manage,we don't 
care with that money

848
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,519
There is something more important.

849
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,316
We've been talking to this child.

850
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,199
She is very troubled.

851
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,314
While you were away I found out
that Karl was a doctor.

852
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,994
He's been trying to help me

853
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,794
You know, Mr. Somers...

854
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,873
... we had much experience of persecution

855
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,875
We know it's only necessary when
very big lies have to be told.

856
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,316
The girl is suffering from such a lie.

857
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,959
Yes, I think so too

858
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,152
But in one part of her mind
she still knows the truth.

859
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,513
-Are you expecting anyone?
- No

860
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,596
Into the kitchen.

861
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,776
Wait in there

862
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,610
Thank you, Karl.

863
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,716
Sophie.

864
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,352
- Doctor Cesare?
- Yes.

865
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,671
- My name is Shepley.
- Yes.

866
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,672
I trying to find a friend of yours.

867
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,831
We have only a few friends in England.

868
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,033
If it were not for this friend,
you wouldn't be in England now.

869
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,430
I haven't seen him not for years.

870
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,630
May I come in?

871
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,650
By all means

872
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,754
I'd like to meet your wife,
she may be able to help us.

873
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,991
Of course

874
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,115
Minna, we have a visitor.

875
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,435
Come on we go

876
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,828
I want you to understand...

877
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,131
... that I have nothing
to do with the police force.

878
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,679
I'm not looking for the girl.

879
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,793
So you see if you have helped him,

880
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,278
you may have done him a disservice

881
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,989
We don't worry...

882
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,598
... wherever he is, Mr Somers
can take care of himself.

883
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,250
And of her

884
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:41,327
Hello!

885
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,835
Hello, Kyra.

886
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,166
Here you are big boy, this will
get you on the boat.

887
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,223
Thanks

888
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,797
They sail a week tonight from Liverpool

889
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,995
And what about passports?

890
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,598
Be outside the Hainan coffee
on the same day at twelve-thirty.

891
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,711
There will be a street bookie waiting

892
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,758
You must speak from your
 language learning

893
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,794
... 'Har yen chow fan ber Lou gai'.

894
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,792
He'll answer: 'Yung chow Dan'.

895
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,150
'Har yen chow fan ber Lou gai'.

896
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,750
- And then 'Yung chow Dan'.
- Clever boy

897
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,719
Butterfly girl.

898
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,549
It's a pretty name,isn't it?

899
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,455
Did she do it?

900
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,598
No, but that's difficult to prove

901
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,975
Poor little thing.

902
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,919
- Well, goodbye.
- Bye, Kyra thank you.

903
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,856
David.

904
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,198
They're working very hard,aren't they?

905
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,633
They blocked both the bridges.

906
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,875
Never mind,we'll take that boat,
come on,the road across

907
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,677
- What about this one?
-No,no,too obvious.

908
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,955
That's ready

909
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,993
We'll soon fix this

910
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,351
Nothing safe is it?

911
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,497
We'll look after her

912
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,116
Right

913
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,429
All right,thank you.

914
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,188
They found the car abandoned
on the moor

915
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,789
Gives them a good start.

916
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,135
Not good enough.

917
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,112
You'll see, we'll get them.

918
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,072
I'll take this one.

919
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,777
Have you any buns,sausage 
rolls or something?

920
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,031
Sorry, sir, the baker doesn't
deliver until nine-thirty or so.

921
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,429
How about some apples?
They are good eaters

922
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,830
All right,two pounds of apples, please.

923
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:31,481
That'll be four and six

924
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:42,456
What do you do up there?

925
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:45,522
I'm hungry, David, can't we
stop here and have something?

926
00:59:45,523 --> 00:59:47,689
You're always hungry,what
about those apples?

927
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,393
There are still some left in your bag

928
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,815
I want some tea, I'm sick
of apples,aren't you?

929
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,172
Well,yes, but I don't
think we ought to stop here.

930
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,094
There's nobody in then and
we needn't stay long

931
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,215
All right just this once then.

932
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,609
Sophie, what did
you and Karl talking about?

933
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,805
I asked him about getting muddled and
that did happen to people.

934
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,332
He asked me a lot of questions.

935
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,295
Then he said it did happen
to some people...

936
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,755
... but not to me.

937
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,135
And the he said that there was
something I forgotten...

938
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,729
that I had to remember

939
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,617
And when I do remember it I 
won't feel muddled anymore

940
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,053
Was it something about finding
your parents dead?

941
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,636
That

942
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,893
Something else.

943
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,058
Come on, we'd better get our bus.

944
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,630
Mike.

945
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,969
What's the matter, Eric?

946
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,790
Fares, please.

947
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,336
All the way,please

948
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,730
-Two for Patterdale.
- Thank you.

949
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,698
I was looking forward to that tea.

950
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,469
You left your bag.

951
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,595
No, I've got it here.

952
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,512
- No, your hand bag.
- But I haven't got it..

953
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,093
You had it at the café.

954
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,418
- Yes, I left it on the chair.
- Come on.

955
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,979
That young man spotted
you,the one at the tea place

956
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,015
What are we going to do?

957
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,019
They will comb the lakes.

958
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,591
But we shan't be here 
we cut across to Liverpool

959
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,532
They got on the Patterdale bus.

960
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,938
Yes, about ten minutes ago.

961
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,651
Right, sir.

962
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,254
The main party is going up the 
hill with the wireless van,Sir

963
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,138
- Straight ahead
- Good thank you.

964
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,396
Straight on

965
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,772
- Joining ahead.
- Right,thank you,drive on

966
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,296
We'll give them a minute and
then we'll double back

967
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,069
Still hungry?

968
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,735
I'm scared

969
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,650
I know.

970
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,530
Here.

971
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,132
Put these things into your bag.

972
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,372
We got to travel light now

973
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:00,090
This is rough country, we are
damned to use the roads,not by daylight

974
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,236
Hot ?

975
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,611
All right

976
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,739
It's theirs all right

977
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,129
Anything interesting in it?

978
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,370
No,nothing they couldn't have
bought anywhere.

979
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,451
No,there wouldn't be

980
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,971
Look, we made 
three rings of police

981
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,616
This is where we found the bag,so we know
that they came through the outer ring

982
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,499
There is only one way they can go,
to the mountain.

983
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,373
And when they do that,
we got them

984
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,292
He's got out of tighter places than that

985
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,212
I believe you want him to get away

986
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,655
Well,I'm sounding the tally-hos this time

987
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:50,618
... but I tell you quite frankly 
I hope I don't give the bush

988
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,171
They've been sighted towards Copley Wood

989
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,290
Jess.

990
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,789
It's Jess.

991
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,664
Nonsense,nonsense

992
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,532
Of course it isn't

993
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:32,739
It was Jess.

994
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,413
I thought I saw Jess.

995
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,938
No, Sophie, you didn't

996
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,052
Come on here, we got to get moving

997
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,335
All right now?

998
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,219
That wasn't Jess you saw.

999
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,295
I thought,it was for a moment
I was so frightened.

1000
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,532
-Because I remembered.
-Remembered what?

1001
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,175
That's how what is was when I saw
my mother and father.

1002
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,093
Someone was there with a gun.

1003
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,772
I thought you found them first?

1004
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,528
That's what Jess said.

1005
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,858
She always explained it that way

1006
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,538
She said I had a shock

1007
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,339
... and I thought I saw someone.

1008
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,530
That's what I remembered
in the woods just now.

1009
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,169
I wasn't muddled

1010
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,177
Someone was there with a gun.

1011
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,490
Who was it, was it Jess?

1012
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,778
I don't know, I can't remember.

1013
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,497
The night when Hick was killed, you
didn't even see him, did you?

1014
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,371
No, but they tried to
make me think I did.

1015
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,053
You believe me, don't you?

1016
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,291
Yes, Sophie,of course
I believe you.

1017
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,453
But I'm not the police.

1018
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,380
Okay, fly captain, message understood.
Out

1019
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,395
The helicopter chap said there was 
no sign of anyone in Copley Wood

1020
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,933
Black mark,fly catcher

1021
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,859
Helicopter report,couple seen
 near Sourmilk Gill,Sir

1022
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,134
Telephone Keswick,tell them to send all
mobile reserves..

1023
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,153
...to the bottom of  
Sourmilk Gill,immediately.

1024
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,539
- Priority one.
- Yes sir

1025
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,730
This must be Sourmilk Gill.

1026
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,336
Well, if we follow
the waterfall down...

1027
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,531
 take us to old track that 
lead us to the main road

1028
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:45,773
Keswick Section Station,
here, Message 1350.

1029
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:49,939
Superintendent requests all
available mobile patrols

1030
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,556
Yes

1031
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,249
Concentrate north of Sourmilk Gill.

1032
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,169
We're trapped,aren't we?

1033
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,648
Look, Sophie, we just got time to
jump before they see us.

1034
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,014
Do you think you can make it?

1035
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,179
I can't,David, it's too wide.

1036
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,336
All right

1037
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,776
Never mind

1038
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,779
Do you see that ledge down there?

1039
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,135
Get in there and make 
yourself small as you can

1040
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,455
And what are you going to do?

1041
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,775
I'll draw them off

1042
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:13,815
Give me your raincoat.

1043
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,572
After they've gone and when it's dark.

1044
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,254
... make your way back to the lake side
 where we got off the bus.

1045
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,939
Do you remember?
And wait for me there.

1046
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,050
Supposing they catch you?

1047
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,699
They won't,I'll come
 for you,I promise.

1048
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,371
Lakeside, where we
got off the bus.

1049
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,596
See you tonight.

1050
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,934
- Be careful.
- I will

1051
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,535
Where's the girl?

1052
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,696
She's not here?

1053
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,696
-No, she's gone away
- Which way

1054
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,533
That's your worry.

1055
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,133
Well, we got Somers.

1056
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,291
The girl won't be much trouble on her own

1057
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,668
You'd better move the men to the other
side of the gully as quick as you can

1058
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:53,816
Is that wise?

1059
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,451
If she got away on that side and Somers
would not leave her behind.

1060
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,538
There's no point for a whole lot
 of men standing around on this side

1061
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,755
How bad is Somers?

1062
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:05,017
The say he broke a couple of ribs and
may have fractured an ankle.

1063
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,729
My ribs.

1064
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,396
Thanks

1065
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,529
How are your legs?

1066
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,776
Hurt.

1067
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,590
Sorry, chap

1068
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,048
Open the door!

1069
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,571
What?

1070
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,774
Get after him, quick,move

1071
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,134
Get a car as quick as you can.

1072
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,611
Knocked out the policeman
and struck the driver,I suppose

1073
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,079
- Come on.
- I told you

1074
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,430
Sophie.

1075
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,055
David.

1076
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,173
I was so afraid

1077
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:59,654
Are you really all right?

1078
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:02,420
Of course I'm all right
Just worried for you.

1079
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,810
I thought I was going to
have to give myself up.

1080
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,293
I'm very glad you didn't

1081
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:10,213
... because we got to take
things into our own hands now.

1082
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,735
And the first thing you
got to have a talk with Jess.

1083
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,069
With Jess?

1084
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,655
It'll be all right, only 
on the telephone.

1085
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,410
They are coming through

1086
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,931
Hello!

1087
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,856
Hello, Jess?

1088
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,256
Where are you?

1089
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:28,710
Now I see

1090
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,895
Why are you telephoning?

1091
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,378
I need help, Jess, to get away

1092
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,036
Abroad

1093
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,155
Where are you?

1094
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:41,017
You take the very wrong to run away,Sophie

1095
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,532
You must give yourself up to the
police, mustn't you,Sophie? "

1096
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,528
No, I need help, Jess.

1097
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,279
Things are not quite the same any longer

1098
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,853
Tell her you started
remembering.

1099
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,779
I don't get muddled anymore.

1100
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,236
What do you want?

1101
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,058
No, that's too much,
I haven't got it

1102
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,379
Two hundred?
Yes,all right

1103
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,693
How can I brief them?

1104
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,372
No, the place wouldn't be safe.

1105
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,533
I'll bring it to you myself.

1106
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,309
All right, Jess.

1107
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,016
Yes, all right

1108
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,176
- I'll be at...
- 5 Coronation Way, Liverpool.

1109
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,137
5 Coronation Way, Liverpool.

01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,296

Yes, Coronation, Thursday
afternoon at three o'clock

1112
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,213
You won't fail me, will you, Jess?

1113
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,810
No, I won't fail

1114
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,655
-Supposing she brings the police?
-No, I don't think she will.

1115
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,572
Anyway it is a chance that we got to take

1116
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,777
Sorry, we missed catching the Five

1117
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,658
- All right, Sir,hop in
- Thank you.

1118
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,449
Hello, Nora, anything
wrong with Glasgow?

1119
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,531
Yes, I try like a change
sometimes

1120
01:15:31,816 --> 01:15:34,599
Your room will cost you a fiver
 this time, Somers.

1121
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,179
She is hot.

1122
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,759
I only want it for an
hour or two, Nora.

1123
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,876
We're expecting a visitor
this afternoon, a lady

1124
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,739
We want a private
talk at three o'clock, you understand?

1125
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,651
I do, but it still cost you a fiver

1126
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,970
What's the matter?
Is this stuff getting more expensive?

1127
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,326
I like the room ready in an hour,Nora

1128
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:52,530
All right, but watch yourself, 
I do not want any trouble

1129
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,789
Nor do we.

1130
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,334
How do you feel like

1131
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,309

1132
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,549

01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,196
Midnight.

1135
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,775

Francesca.

1137
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,834
-What about the passports?
-Another twenty-five nickel

1138
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,709
Foxes are up today.

1139
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,029
So are butterflies.

1140
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,396

Mr. and Master Fox

1149
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,434
Master Fox, that means you've
 got to have your hair cut off

1150
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,631
Waiter.

1151
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,954

She can cut it later, for the photograph
I'll retouch

1160
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,451

I'm going out to get you a jacket.

1170
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,676
And while I'm away

1171
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,916

I'll put it down here,shall I?

1191
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,634
Good morning, Mr. Croft.

You got those clothes for me?

1194
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,790
I wasn't quite sure of the size.

1195
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,956
To fit a boy.

1196
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,499
- Yes - A slim boy.

1197
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,198
Well, one of these?

1198
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,393
No, too big.

1199
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,354
Not too big.

1200
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,870
No, no...

1201
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,435
Hello Chum

1202
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,457
Bring you sporter(?) 
shopping for Master Fox?

1203
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,240
Well, shall we push off?

1204
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,552
Yes, if you wish

1205
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,693
I shan't ask you where she is.

1206
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,360
No, of course not, could be 
a waste of time,wouldn't it?

1207
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,913
Anyway,it's you I'm after

1208
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,532
<i>The train now standing
at platform 7...</i>

1209
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,617
<i>... is the Express. for London..</i>

1210
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,295
<i>... and will be leaving 
in two minutes...</i>

1211
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:57,419
<i>... stopping at Crewe,
Rugby and Euston.</i>

1212
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:04,096
If the department did things properly,
Willy, you have reserved seat for us

1213
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,202
Yeah, I know,old boy

1214
01:21:05,302 --> 01:21:08,176
but then we couldn't absolutely depend 
on a chap like you to fill them

1215
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,898
You underestimate yourself

1216
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,976
I am a realist

1217
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,732
You ought to have done
it at the station.

1218
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,518
I did not want to

1219
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,571
- Madame, excuse me.
- David.

1220
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,200
Let me help you.
I'll take care of the child.

1221
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,316
Come with me.

1222
01:21:20,316 --> 01:21:22,116
Thank you very much. Go with the gentleman.

1223
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,173
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Do not push.

1224
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,793
That's right

1225
01:21:27,864 --> 01:21:28,936
Let me through,madam

1226
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,155
- Take your hands off me.
- Madam, please.

1227
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:34,217
I'll find out, how your son has
 probably been kidnapped

1228
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,376
Ernie!

1229
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,376
Yes.

1230
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,450
Nicholas.

1231
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:19,175
Now we mustn't make a sound 
child,we must be very quiet.

1232
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,853
- I know.
- You must be quiet.

1233
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,771
Nicholas!

1234
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,799
Do not scream or I'll have to stop you
and I don't want to do it that way

1235
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,130
You see, I am very fond of you

1236
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,216
Where is Jess?

1237
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,496
She's waiting for me,
she won't be here.

1238
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,291
This is something that I have to do

1239
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,215
It was you who killed my mother.

1240
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,459
I remember now.

1241
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,015
I saw you.

1242
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,094
And then Jess came.

1243
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,008
That day in the garden.

1244
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,175
... you killed my mother.

1245
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:55,908
Only because she interfered 
 I didn't want to kill her.

1246
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,814
It was him.

1247
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,648
Jess liked him

1248
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,489
He had to go

1249
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,253
Just like Hick had to go

1250
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:12,145
I warned Jess, but she 
wouldn't take any notice

1251
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,931
I'm the only one she protects.

1252
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,331
As long as I have
Jess, I'm safe

1253
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,288
I'm sorry, child

1254
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:23,495
It's locked

1255
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,298
We shan't be disturbed

1256
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,616
Sophie!

1257
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:46,990
Sophie!

1258
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,095
Sophie!

1259
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,476
Fenton.

1260
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,770
- Willy.
- Get in

1261
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,856
Willy.

1262
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,728
(?),Sir

1263
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,738
Little boy in blue here
 is getting impatient.

1264
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,994
If this another game of yours,I don't think
the department will be able to help.

1265
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,470
Hurry them up, Willy,hurry them up

1266
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:23,590
Inspector.
- Sir.

1267
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,412
-Bay D.
-Well, drive on

1268
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,556
Go right.

1269
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,489
She's up there.

1270
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:46,989
Yes, there's she is,let's get her.

1271
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,015
Now wait, there's your man.

1272

Come on quick

1273
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,571
Can you lift me up there

1274
01:28:26,059 --> 01:28:27,059
Right!

1275
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:44,103
Hold on, Sophie!
