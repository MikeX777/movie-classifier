00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:41,663
Eight years old, Richard Wagner is present at the death of his stepfather,
Ludwig Geyer, whose last words are: "Will Richard be musically gifted?"

Two years later, Richard spends an important night in Leipzig with his Uncle Adolf an Aunt
Frederike, sleeping in the ceremonial bed of August "the Strong" in the home of Jeannette Thomé.

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
At the age of 17, Wagner studies
with Cantor Weinlich in Leipzig.

6
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:09,190
At a celebratory dinner by Polish revolutionaries fleeing
to Paris, Wagner discovers his talent for conducting.

7
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:16,310
In 1834 Wagner, now 21 years of age, takes on his first employment as conductor at Lauchtstädt - as he
had fallen in love at first sight, with the beautiful Minna Planer, the star of the theatre company.

8
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:51,800
The conductor gets engaged to the Minna
Planer - under extraordinary circumstances.

9
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:21,069
On 24. November 1836, Wagner leads his wife into their future home. To furnish it, Wagner has
incurred substantial debts, which is a great source of worry to the the practical Minna.

00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:47,666
Wagner is pursued by his creditios as far as Riga, where he has, since 1838, become conuctor
of the Theatre. As he doesn't possess a passport, he is forced to escape in secret.

13
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:24,550
Dear Wagner, Return fortwith! The police are in your
house, Minna is in despair. Your friend Möller.

14
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,200
In 1839, he lees from
Russia by sea to Paris.

15
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,600
The tumultuous journey by sea gives him
the ideas for his "The Flying Dutchman".

16
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:07,300
In Paris, Wagner plays his opera "Rienzi" for the composer Meyerbeer, who
gives him a letter of recommendation to the Director of the Grand Opera.

17
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:49,050
My exteemed Duponchel! Herewith I recommend to you the young Wagner and his opera
"Rienzi". Please take on its production! The opera is brilliant! Meyerbeer.

18
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Meyerbeer's letter of recommendation,
however, has no effect on Director Duponchel.

19
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Wagner visit the composer Liszt in his hotel
to get support, likewise without success.

20
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:54,490
Wagner is increasingly in need of help. "The Flying Dutchman" is tormenting his spirit,
and Minna's complaints are leading him to despair. He close to breaking-point...

21
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Leipzig 26. February 1842 Dear Richard! I have just been informed that your opera "Rienzi" has been accepted by the
Royal Court Opera in Dresden. Come here at once; I enclose the money for your journey Your brother in law, Brockhaus.

22
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:37,400
On 20. October 1842, Wagner's "Rienzi" is performed by
the Royal Opera in Dresden and is a resounding success.

23
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:14,400
At the age of 30, Richard Wagner becomes
the Royal Court conductor in Dresen.

24
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:27,400
In an optimistic mood, he furnishes his house luxuriously,
which again instils fear and trepidation in Minna.

25
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:44,700
On 2. January 1843, however, Wagner's position is severely unnerved
by the premiere of "The Flying Dutchman" which is a fiasco.

26
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,800
This and other new worries
affect his musical endeavours.

27
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:29,300
Complaints about Wagner lead the Intendant Von Lüttichau to
admonish him sternly and to inform him of the King's displeasure.

28
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:31,150
To our Indentant Our conductor Wagner appears to have formed the opinion by
overestimating his own talent, that he is on a par with the great Meyerbeer.

29
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:42,150
Consequently, he has made such grave mistakes that it would
certainly be worth considering to ask him to offer his resignation.

30
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:53,150
On the other hand, his zeal and extraordinary achievements, which
have been brought to our notice, warrant giving him another chance.

31
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:04,150
In which case, attention should most certainly be
paid to his material cirumstances. Augustus Rex.

32
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:35,900
On 10. October 1845, to compound this disaster, his opera
"Tannhäuser", due poor attendance, is also a flop.

33
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:47,700
In this same period, Wagner is exchanging ideas about his musical reforms with
the Russian revolutionary, Bakunin, who was staying in Dresden at this time.

34
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:07,400
The Royal Court conductor carried away by the prevailing excitement, is led to
speak at a political gathering about freedom of art and the freedom of mankind.

35
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:02,800
Wagner openly takes part in the
subsquent riots in Dresden in 1849.

36
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:53,700
Thanks to a coincidence, he avoids being taken prisoner, and manages to flee, unlike his fellow revolutionaries
of the Preliminary Revolutionary Government, Hübner, Martin and Bakunin, who arrested and tried.

37
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:46,850
Liszt in Weimar provides Wagner with a false passport and the
necessary money, enabling him to cross the Swiss border.

38
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Warrant for Arrest The Royal Court conductor Richard Wagner, described below, due to
appear in court for his part in the havoc played out in this town, is on the run.

Wagner immediately if and when he re-enters the country.

00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:42,200
Part Three: Banishment.

43
00:57:42,322 --> 00:57:50,322
His period in Zurich as a political refugee was extremely creative; In
November 1852 he recites his "Nibelungen Poems" to his circle of friends.

44
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:26,700
Inspired by the ideal relationship between himself and the beautiful wife
of his neighbor Otto Wesendonck, Wagner creates "Tristan and Isolde".

45
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:36,600
To my beloved Isolde Tristan.

46
01:05:53,500 --> 01:06:01,500
Minna's jealousy and lack of tact destroys
not only, but also her own marriage.

47
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:47,200
In 1858, at the age of 45, Wagner
divorces his life's companion.

48
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:33,200
Lonely and deserted by all, he
now lives only for his work.

from the new young King of Bavaria, Ludwig II., recalling him from his solitude.

50
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:36,100
His Majesty the King of Bavaria expresses his deep admiration for the Great Master and invites him to come to
Munich without delay. There he will find a comfortable home and every means to continue, unhindered, his creations.

51
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:49,179
Part four: A royal friendship.

52
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:57,180
In an attempt to use the idolatrous friendship of the King for Wagner for their
own end, Ministers and Jesuits attempt, unsuccessfully, to bribe Wagner.

53
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:42,500
Appeal for the establishment of a Catholic Peaople's Bank. Lord Klindworth has decided with support of the Holy

To do Mister Wagner a special favour, the sum
has to be paid in small change. Pfistermeister.

01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:05,200
On higher orders, we herewith pay you 50.000 Reichsthaler as an
interest-free advance for life. The Holders of the Royal Coffers.

II. To refuse wagner residence in the countra. Everyone to sign the appeal to the King. The Committee.

61
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:31,600

force Ludwig II. To move Wagner out of Munich.

62
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:16,600

a while. Believe me, I'm forced to act thus. My friendship for you will last forever.

Please remember me with friendship because, I dare say hornestly, I'm worthy of it. Who
can part us? I know you sympathise with me, as you can understand my deep suffering.

65
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:59,100
I couldn't do otherwise, please be convinced of that, and
don't doubt your best friend. Yours until death, Ludwig.

66
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:12,300
In the villa Triebschen at the lake of Lucerne, the Master finally finds
peace, in his loneliness, he seeks solace by composting "Die Meistersinger".

acclaim. These performances are attended by Ludwig II. And Wilhelm I., King of Prussian.

74
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:12,300
But only the unforgettable performances of "Parsifal" in
1882 finally crown the life work of the Immortal Master.

75
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:30,300
Only in Bayreuth Parsifal may be performed in all future solely. Pasifal
should never be presented on any theatre to the audience to the amusement.
