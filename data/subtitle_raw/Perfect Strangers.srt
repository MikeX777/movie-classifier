1
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,569
-I'm sick of it.
-Yeah. So am I.

2
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,615
-Best will be getting ready to go.
-I know. Absolutely.

3
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,659
I can predict totally
what's going to happen.

4
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,954
-Yeah, I'll end up taking Geoff home.
-Dire.

5
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,457
-And you'll go home with Bill.
-No, I won't.

6
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,167
-Yes, you will.
-No, I won't.

7
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,879
Because he farts in bed
and his feet stink.

8
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,549
-So there's no truth to the rumour?
-Absolutely not...

9
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,678
-Can I borrow your orange jersey?
-No.

10
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
Sauce.

11
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,520
Thanks.

12
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,065
Next.

13
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,236
-How are you?
-Fine.

14
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:58,201
Can you tell me please...
what is paua?

15
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,248
Shellfish. And wouldn't like it. I'd
have the fish and chips if was you.

16
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,049
-Have a nice day.
-Same to you with knobs on.

17
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,011
Was ist das nobs?

18
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,895
Are you asleaze or tease
the quiz he wants you to take.

19
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,024
Come on, Mel. You could
be doing that at home.

20
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,986
He doesn't want to stay over on the
first date, but he does with you.

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,031
Do you a) believe him
and take him straight to bed?

22
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,491
b) smile wisely and
take him to bed anyway?

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,037
Or c) know he's lying and
steer ahead with caution?

24
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,621
C.

25
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,957
A.

26
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,089
B...I'd smile wisely.
I'm giving it up.

27
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,724
Isn't that the band Adrian was in?

28
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,351
Ahhh... nah.

29
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,436
-Who was he?
-Her ex.

30
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,856
-Yeah, ages ago.
-When she was young and stupid.

31
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,775
ike you.

32
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,574
I like this one.

33
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,591
-Gidday, Melsie. How's it going?
-Pete! How's your wife?

34
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,844
-Hey, Mel.
-Adrien.

35
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,555
What's the story?

36
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,892
I'll see you round, eh?

37
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,647
See ya.

38
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,444
-I like the look of that drummer.
-Got bad habits written over him.

39
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,196
You wish.

40
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,241
Hi. Just the usual, thanks.

41
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,911
-A drummer without girlfriend?
-I dunno. What?

42
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,038
Homeless.

43
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,345
What about them?

44
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,057
They don't look too bad.

45
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,020
-Anyone know'em?
-Nah.

46
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,272
Well, that's a start.

47
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,121
-You've been in the bush, have ya?
-Yeah.

48
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,790
-Oh yeah. How was that?
-All right.

49
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,376
Were you there for long?

50
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,005
What were you doing?

51
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,049
I was killing stuff.

52
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,551
Like what?

53
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,762
Pigs. Deer.

54
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,307
-Yeah, it was all right.
-I hate the bush.

55
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,229
People wander in there, you know,
and they never come out again.

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,233
You can't... yeah. You can't
escape into the bush. You can't..

57
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,153
Can't stand it.

58
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,030
Have we met before?

59
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,657
No.

60
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,960
They're nice shoes.

61
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,171
Where did you get those from?

62
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,841
Italy.

63
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,161
Let's go.

64
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,206
Your place or mine?

65
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,292
Yours.

66
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,878
I've been to mine.

67
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,704
Suppose you live in a luxury
yacht down here, do you?

68
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,457
You got that right.

69
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,462
I love that smell.

70
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,590
Seaweed, old rope, plastic bags?

71
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,467
Fish'n...

72
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,313
-I could carry you, if you want.
-No, you couldn't.

73
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,066
Oh I could. I used to be a fireman.

74
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,776
No, you didn't.

75
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,404
-I did.
-No, you didn't.

76
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,281
No, I didn't.

77
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,789
-So where is it?
-Close your eyes.

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,043
And I will lead you there.

79
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,596
Straight ahead.

80
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,364
Nice.

81
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,909
Sit down.

82
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,556
So who's your girlfriend?

83
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,684
It's for you.

84
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,442
Oh, you've got avery big heart.

85
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,656
And you see the way those
two lines cross there?

86
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:40,872
That mean's someone who is very
close to you is very dangerous.

87
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,920
And this hand...

88
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,257
This hand...

89
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:57,722
that's what you're born with and
this is what you make of your life.

90
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,100
A big mess.

91
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,020
Are you Taurus?

92
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,774
I'll bet you've got Taurus
in your rising sign.

93
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,818
I'm a Leo.

94
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,618
Is that good?

95
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,956
Well, Leo and Aries are
really good together.

96
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,377
-Right.
-You know like...

97
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,423
Right.

98
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,718
Do you know what else I can do?

99
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,263
I can read minds.

100
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,686
So what am I thinking?

101
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,314
Oh well, I'm not going to
tell you what you're thinking...

102
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,152
'cos you're thinking
what I'm thinking...

103
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,614
Hey...

104
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,394
Let me out!

105
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,356
You jerk.

106
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,555
Let me out!

107
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,686
Let me out!

108
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,695
Help! Let me out!

109
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,947
Let me out!

110
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,123
Good-morning.

111
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,208
What are you? Deaf or something?

112
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,212
Sleep well?

113
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,856
Where am l?

114
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,989
Exhilarating, isn't it?

115
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,493
For your hangover.

116
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,038
I've got work today.
Where are we going?

117
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,041
To my place.
You said you wanted to.

118
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,086
You're going to love it.

119
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,464
Well, what's the time now?
And when will we get back?

120
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,718
We can't go back now.
We're almost there.

121
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,722
Relax.

122
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,355
To you.

123
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,534
You know the best thing
about going away?

124
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,287
Coming home again.

125
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,154
You all right?

126
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,323
No, I'm not.

127
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,327
Silly billy.

128
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,873
Did I tell you, l, you know, really
don't go for all this nature shit?

129
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,834
Don't worry. I'll look after you.

130
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,090
There is nothing I wouldn't
do for you, you know.

131
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,353
Why are you so jumpy?

132
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,231
I'm not jumpy.

133
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,110
I just don't know you very
well, you know, and l...

134
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,739
I didn't realise
we were coming here.

135
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,367
Look, I'm sorry.

136
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,662
Look, I know it's silly...

137
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,916
-I just want to go home.
-Yes, it is silly.

138
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,087
But don't worry.
I'll get you back.

139
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,091
Not now. The tides
are wrong, but ah...

140
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,512
First thing in the morning.
I promise.

141
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,212
Just chuck up your wet stuff.
I'll dig you out something dry.

142
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,496
I suppose you provide these
for all your guests, do you?

143
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,948
I will always remember
you like this.

144
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:51,019
So, why don't you tell
me about yourself?

145
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,276
If I wasn't in love with you,
I wouldn't be so boring.

146
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:04,032
But I just want to say'l love you'
all the time - it's all I think of.

147
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,162
But you don't even know me.

148
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,670
Let me tell you astory.

149
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,843
Once upon a time
there was a lovely girl...

150
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,682
Let's call her Melanie,
Princess Melanie...

151
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,228
whose mother, the queen,
the wicked queen...

152
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:38,525
was so absent-minded she forgot
that she had a daughter...

153
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,445
and went away on long
journeys with nary a backward glance.

154
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:47,909
Her father, the king,
took many courtesans...

155
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,372
and the lonely girl
grew up wild and wanton.

156
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:56,668
Many princes were her suitors...

157
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,212
and she pleased herself
with all of them.

158
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:04,300
A troubadour stole her heart, but
he rode off into various sunsets...

159
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:09,139
Ieaving her slaving in the kitchen,
dumped there.

160
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,808
Poor, lovely girl.

161
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,311
But then...

162
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,398
one dark and stormy night...

163
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,652
a man who wasn't a prince,
just a man...

164
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:27,282
blew in and took her across
the seas to his castle...

165
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,827
where they fell in love...

166
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,621
and got married...

167
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,083
and lived happily ever after.

168
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,506
How did you know my name?

169
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,804
Well, you told me last night.

170
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,141
Right.

171
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,521
-What else forgotten about last night?
-Nothing to be ashamed of.

172
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,617
This place is going to
do you a lot of good.

173
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,245
How do you know so much about me?

174
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,873
I know everything about you...

175
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,004
because I love you.

176
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,259
You can't love me.

177
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,595
Oh, but I do.

178
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,223
So there it is.

179
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:20,687
But ummm...
I don't know anything about you.

180
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:25,483
Oh, don't worry about that.
Here I am.

181
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,698
Do you want me?

182
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,369
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I just thought I'd...

183
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,163
-What are you...
-Nothing, I just thought...

184
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,666
-What are you thinking?
-Oh, come on. You know you want...

185
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,128
Not like this. This is... different.

186
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,011
I need to know
do you love me?

187
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,516
You have to love me.

188
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,146
All right. I love you.

189
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,940
-No, no, no, l...
-Don't say it like that.

190
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,862
You make it sound cheap.
Make it cheap.

191
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,867
I want to marry you.

192
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,328
You understand?

193
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,627
Oh, that's funny...

194
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,006
-Oh, that's funny, is it?
-No.

195
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,428
You think that's funny?

196
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,515
You're insulting, you know.

197
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,892
Never, never laugh at me.

198
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,316
You are not kind.

199
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,529
You want to get some
kindness into you!

200
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,949
I'm too kind.

201
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,371
...too kind.

202
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,092
Oh no you don't.

203
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,180
Oh no you don't.
I wanna talk to you.

204
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,559
Open the door.

205
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,145
Open the door!

206
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,153
Are you listening?

207
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:36,614
Just open the door.
I just wanna talk to you.

208
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,742
Come on out.

209
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,509
I just want to talk to you.

210
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,146
God.

211
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,211
Good-morning.

212
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,555
Hello?

213
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:38,893
Hello, can you hear me because...
because I can't hear you.

214
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:44,315
Um... There's a, there's a,
there's a man that l...

215
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,404
He's... he's hurt and I think
he's going to hurt me.

216
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:58,413
There's a... a a jetty,
and there's and there's rocks...

217
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,331
and there is water...

218
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:05,086
and and and I l think
I've been kidnapped.

219
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:07,714
Um...'K' for...

220
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:12,719
kippers and'l' for idiot
and'D' for desperate...

221
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:15,597
and'N' for nothing.

222
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,351
I think I'm in danger.

223
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:26,608
I think I'm in danger.

224
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,278
Please don't do this to me.

225
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,741
Don't leave me.

226
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,202
Fat chance of that, isn't there?

227
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,206
You bastard!

228
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:29,170
Wipe that smile off your face.
You're not going to do this to me.

229
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,840
I'm not staying! You wake up!
I'm not staying here.

230
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,218
You friggin' help me,
for God's sake.

231
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,700
Come on.

232
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,077
That's it.

233
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,144
Get up.

234
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,816
Come on. Get up.
Get up!

235
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:10,772
Thank-you.

236
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,545
Which way is it to the
nearest neighbour?

237
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:38,299
You tell me - which way is it?

238
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,720
Is there anyone else on the island?

239
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:48,435
I could murder you for doing
this to me. You know that?

240
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,062
I know that. I do.

241
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,690
This isn't working.

242
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:58,528
Stitch it.

243
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:04,743
I'm not stitching. I'm not.
I'm not stitching that.

244
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:17,172
Okay...

245
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,680
Oh God!

246
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,185
You know what?

247
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:34,522
You should try reciting
your times table backwards.

248
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:37,567
It'll take your mind off the pain if
you concentrate on something else.

249
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,614
8O...

250
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,033
72, 64...

251
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,994
No, no you need something harder
than this...

252
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:52,707
Poetry, poetry.
Wait, wait, wait...

253
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,756
"What is true love, who can tell.
What causes such a..."

254
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,133
magic spell..."

255
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,220
that fills the veins
with liquid fire..."

256
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,556
and fills the heart
with warm desire."

257
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:13,311
God. Do it quickly for God's sake.

258
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,064
You nearly finished?

259
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,528
"To make the loved
one all your own..."

260
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,905
Jesus...

261
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,741
"And place her on
a loving throne..."

262
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:34,749
"... but change she earth and change
still I will love her till I die"

263
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:38,878
which might be quite soon.

264
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,673
Look, I'm I'm nearly finished.

265
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,968
I'm just tying the knots.

266
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:02,152
Don't die. Please don't die.

267
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:11,703
"l am bright with
the wonder of you..."

268
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:17,167
despite the dark
waiting I endure..."

269
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,672
"l am bright..."

270
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:25,550
with the wonder of you."

271
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:43,360
I'm so sorry.

272
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,410
Hello.

273
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:52,382
-Did you think I was dead?
-I'm glad you're not.

274
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:58,680
"Yesterday has gone.
Bring on the sensible day."

275
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,850
Who said that?

276
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:03,852
I don't know.

277
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,603
Me.

278
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:22,912
Open the flue. That's the thing at
the bottom of the chimney, see?

279
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:25,248
Should be vertical.

280
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,084
-Good.
-Good...

281
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:31,838
and now the second door down.
Open that.

282
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,175
And put the lid on.

283
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:39,971
All right. I've done that.

284
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:42,724
Now what?

285
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,936
Now you have to give it
a good talking to, you have to...

286
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:52,192
tell her how much better she'll feel
with a good fire in her belly.

287
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:57,405
-I'm not doing that. That's stupid.
-You talk to her firmly but clearly.

288
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:02,994
Right. Well...

289
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:08,249
I don't know you very well, but
I'm sure we're going to get along.

290
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,502
Good.

291
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:14,005
Now you listen to the fire.

292
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:18,176
The fire will tell you all...

293
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:21,012
that it needs.

294
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,024
There you go.

295
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,657
Eat it...

296
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:43,743
Eat.

297
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:46,788
Look.

298
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,416
Here comes the choo choo train.

299
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,627
Choo choo.

300
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,635
-lf you don't eat, you'll die.
-And go to Heaven.

301
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:07,976
Doubt it.

302
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,343
Hello.

303
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:04,551
Don't fall asleep, okay?

304
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:09,097
Stay awake and talk to
me please. I get lonely.

305
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,224
I'm not asleep.

306
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:13,560
Yeah, you are.

307
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,938
I've got my eyes closed
so I can see you better.

308
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:20,608
I'm manifesting you.

309
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:23,403
You're much nicer in here.

310
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:29,034
Actually, I know what you mean.
I went out with a guy like that.

311
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,956
Whenever I left his company,
he came with me inside my head.

312
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,210
That got your attention, didn't it?

313
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,339
-I'm jealous.
-God, don't be.

314
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,717
He took off with someone else.
Bastard.

315
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:49,346
-Good.
-No, it wasn't. It was awful...

316
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,725
Adrian.

317
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:57,687
You'd think I've known with a name
like that, don't you? Adrian.

318
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,981
Bloody Adrian.

319
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:04,152
This particular day,
I was standing in the kitchen...

320
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:07,113
staring out the window...

321
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:11,576
don't you reckon it's weird what you
remember when bad things happen...

322
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,332
Iike he says he's leaving...

323
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:19,626
really quietly like...

324
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:26,966
that he didn't love me.
Didn't think he ever did.

325
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:33,139
And then he runs outside...

326
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:37,602
and a car pulls up,
like magic or something...

327
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,648
And he gets into it, drives away.

328
00:49:42,732 --> 00:49:44,401
Gone. Just like that.

329
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,990
I wouldn't ever do that to you.

330
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,996
It's rather unlikely
under the circumstances.

331
00:49:57,205 --> 00:50:00,583
No, seriously, I would
never do that to you.

332
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:08,174
-You don't even remember me, do you?
-When?

333
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:10,635
I ordered oysters.

334
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:15,932
And you had a little bead of
sweat in the middle of your...

335
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:18,268
forehead and
I wanted to brush it off.

336
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,813
You needed rescuing.

337
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:25,358
Was it that obvious?

338
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,746
This can't go on.

339
00:51:52,445 --> 00:51:54,072
Come on, come on.

340
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,783
Wake up. Please.

341
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,997
We're gonna go back. And you're
going to help get us there.

342
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:06,042
-No.
-Yes, you have to. Come on.

343
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:08,169
You'll leave me.

344
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,755
Love equals trust.

345
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,590
Please.

346
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:15,343
I'm so happy here with you.

347
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:18,054
We'll work everything out
when you're better.

348
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:21,725
But we've gotta go.
Please come on. Let's just go.

349
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,234
If you love me...

350
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,237
you prove it.

351
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:42,662
In the shed.

352
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,251
Wheelbarrow.

353
00:52:58,553 --> 00:52:59,888
There you go.

354
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:03,767
Ready?

355
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,898
-You're being very brave.
-Stupid.

356
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:12,484
Yip. Well they go hand in hand, eh?

357
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:16,363
-Yeah, probably.
-I only do stupidity.

358
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:18,698
Oh, you can say that again.

359
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,837
Don't worry.

360
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:36,341
Your secret is safe with me.

361
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:39,511
What secret?

362
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:41,721
That you're afraid.

363
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,725
Yeah. Only of you.

364
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,020
Nah. Of commitment.

365
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,107
Yeah, right.

366
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:56,361
But love will find away.

367
00:53:57,737 --> 00:53:59,322
Will it?

368
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:16,548
You know, I've gotten used
to you a little bit.

369
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:19,843
It wasn't easy though, was it?

370
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:22,262
No.

371
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:28,977
No.

372
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:33,023
This is gonna hurt you more than
it's going to hurt me.

373
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,160
Okay.

374
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,538
When you get your breath back...

375
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:53,376
do I have to talk to
this to make it go?

376
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:58,715
You have to sing.

377
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:03,136
-Anything in particular?
-No, you choose.

378
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,267
""What shallqwe do qwith
the drunken sailor?

379
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:12,020
What shallqwe do qwith the
drunken sailor?

380
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:14,481
What shallqwe do qwith the
drunken sailor?

381
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:16,733
Early in the morning?

382
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:19,903
Hoo-ray and up she rises

383
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:24,908
Hoo-ray and up she rises""

384
00:56:16,209 --> 00:56:18,253
How much further is it?

385
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,325
We're there...

386
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,703
We're there!

387
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:40,061
No!

388
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:46,109
No!

389
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:51,998
Thank you, darling.

390
01:03:58,713 --> 01:04:02,008
Haven't even touched your tea and
I went to all the bother to make it.

391
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:05,428
Sorry.

392
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:15,730
I don't expect you to like this...

393
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:18,483
but you'll get used to it.

394
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,863
And it's foryour oqwn good. Because
I m goingto have to shut the lid...

395
01:04:25,448 --> 01:04:29,202
but at the coldest
hour, the one before daqwn...

396
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:34,165
...Illopen the lid and
qwe can do qwhateveryou qwant.

397
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:41,965
Within reason.

398
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:31,324
Stay there.

399
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:46,066
Everyday in everyqway
I m getting better and better

400
01:07:46,274 --> 01:07:50,653
Everyday in everyqway
I m getting better and better

401
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:54,741
Everyday in every qway
I m getting better and better

402
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:57,952
You've got to feel god about
yourself though, haven't you?

403
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:03,124
You have been so generous...

404
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:07,504
you're kind, you're good...

405
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:11,549
And I don't just mean
last night either.

406
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:16,054
You know, because at the risk of
sounding just a little bit crude...

407
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:21,935
you were brilliant.
I mean, you were the best.

408
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:26,690
Bar none.

409
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:29,943
I'm so grateful to you,
my beautiful thing because...

410
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:34,030
you helped me break
through my own resistance.

411
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:39,035
You know and you loved me
no matter what I did to you.

412
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:49,004
Do you know, for the first
time in my life, I'm happy?

413
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:56,219
And I don't even know
your name, do l?

414
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:00,432
God, you're cold.

415
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:03,852
No that's okay. That's good.
That's good.

416
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:14,237
I'll love you forever.

417
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,161
You and me...

418
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:06,081
born again.

419
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:37,529
You've got to feel good about
yourself though, haven't you?

420
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:46,121
God, it's so quiet.

421
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,544
Am I talking too much?

422
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:57,757
'Cos that's what men complain about,
that women talk too much.

423
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,719
But I reckon men talk just as
much, even more some of them...

424
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:02,887
and they're often not
very good listeners, are they?

425
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:06,725
Oh, I don't mean you, my darling.

426
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:10,895
You know, you're in
a class of your own.

427
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:13,773
You're a good listener.

428
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,542
No secrets.

429
01:12:21,257 --> 01:12:22,884
We must be honest.

430
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,544
Don't worry. I'll get rid of them.

431
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:36,768
Bill?

432
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:49,864
So what's been going on?

433
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:52,492
It's a delicate matter.

434
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,251
It's our honeymoon.

435
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:04,504
Who got who?

436
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,091
It's not funny, Bill.

437
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:09,926
I'll say...

438
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:13,930
So was it you or him?

439
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,726
-What?
-Smashed up my hut.

440
01:15:19,269 --> 01:15:21,312
He's supposed to maintain it,
not demolish it.

441
01:15:25,525 --> 01:15:27,485
-So where is he?
-He's fishing.

442
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:30,655
-On his honeymoon?
-Yeah.

443
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:36,119
-That's not very nice.
-Well, it's fine with me.

444
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,503
-Hiding in the dunny.
-I didn't know it was you, did l?

445
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:54,512
Hope you're not going to stay long.

446
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,349
Visitors are like fish.

447
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,061
After two days, they stink.

448
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:11,112
Does he know?

449
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,741
-What?
-About this mess.

450
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:20,997
This pisses me right... off.

451
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:25,210
Ionly slept qwith him once.
And he qwasn't even very good.

452
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:32,258
He's usually aggressively tidy.

453
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:35,595
I don't think you're
very good for him.

454
01:16:45,438 --> 01:16:47,941
You dig up the carrots too?

455
01:16:51,861 --> 01:16:54,531
-I like digging.
-Strange.

456
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:58,952
You're not very good at it...
I mean, what awaste, you know...

457
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:01,329
Complete bloody waste.

458
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:36,072
Dust to dust.

459
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:55,170
I'm having a learning curve.

460
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:05,096
Think the bullet...

461
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:07,057
right to the target...

462
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:10,560
-Can you feel your heart beat?
-Yeah.

463
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:12,604
Now, breath out.

464
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:22,906
Slowly, squeeze the trigger and...

465
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:29,621
I am so...

466
01:20:30,538 --> 01:20:32,624
so proud of you.

467
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:37,170
-I love you.
-And I love you right back.

468
01:20:37,587 --> 01:20:41,341
I'm going to do it myself
now, okay? Okay?

469
01:21:01,736 --> 01:21:03,905
Do you think I could shoot you?

470
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:06,741
Bet you couldn't.

471
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:11,246
I might kill you. Do you think
you can kill someone twice?

472
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:17,335
I don't know. We'll just do it.

473
01:21:31,349 --> 01:21:32,767
Oh, look.

474
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,896
It's perfectly all right, you know.
There's no harm done.

475
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:43,820
Do you forgive me?

476
01:21:44,362 --> 01:21:46,239
There's nothing to forgive.

477
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:51,494
So I'm forgiven?

478
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:55,040
Totally.

479
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:02,672
I totally,
totally forgive you, too.

480
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:22,108
Come on.

481
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:09,215
Wake up!

482
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:14,346
What happened?

483
01:24:14,554 --> 01:24:15,930
Nothing.

484
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,932
What did you do?

485
01:24:19,893 --> 01:24:22,354
-What happened to him?
-Nothing has happened to him.

486
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:24,773
-He's dead!
-No, he's not.

487
01:24:24,939 --> 01:24:26,983
-What did you do?
-I haven't done anything.

488
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:29,069
-What did you do?
-I haven't done anything.

489
01:24:29,277 --> 01:24:30,487
-He's all right.
-He's dead!

490
01:24:30,653 --> 01:24:31,821
-He's not!
-He's dead!

491
01:24:31,988 --> 01:24:35,533
No, he's not! He's got his eyes
shut so he can see me better.

492
01:24:35,825 --> 01:24:37,827
-That's all, he likes it out there.
-He's dead!

493
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:39,537
He's not... dead!

494
01:24:39,871 --> 01:24:41,373
-There's nothing wrong with him.
-Come here!

495
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:43,917
-He's fine!
-Shut up!

496
01:24:53,426 --> 01:24:55,095
Look, look!

497
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:57,514
Open your eyes!

498
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,502
What have you done to him?

499
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:30,255
-What?
-What have you done to him?

500
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:34,009
Where did you make him go?
You've done something to him...

501
01:25:34,175 --> 01:25:36,720
-What are you talking about?
-You've made him dead!

502
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:39,806
You, you, you made
him dead... murderer!

503
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:41,850
Murderer!

504
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:44,936
Murderer!

505
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:51,651
Let go of me!

506
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,031
Let go of me!

507
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,575
Let go of me!

508
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:03,204
Calm down. Calm down.

509
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:05,665
-Where is he?
-Calm down!

510
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:17,218
Get off me.
I don't want to be held by you!

511
01:26:17,427 --> 01:26:19,429
-Calm down!
-Get off me!

512
01:28:01,489 --> 01:28:03,742
How you want your eggs?

513
01:28:06,202 --> 01:28:08,038
Runny. Ta.

514
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:19,341
Come on, m'girlie.

515
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,976
They let you keep your babies
in jail, don't they?

516
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:36,608
Are you pregnant?

517
01:28:37,817 --> 01:28:39,944
A little bit.

518
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:47,410
Well, how much is that?

519
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,999
He'd have wanted you
to be godfather.

520
01:29:19,984 --> 01:29:21,945
-Hey, Bill?
-What?

521
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:24,906
If you let me stay here...

522
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:28,326
I'd love you forever.

523
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:31,830
No, you wouldn't.
You don't even like me.

524
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:35,500
Yes, I do.

525
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:44,759
So what was the big idea?

526
01:29:46,636 --> 01:29:48,763
There's no big idea.

527
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:54,936
"See you round, Bill."

528
01:29:55,895 --> 01:29:57,272
Oh, right...

529
01:29:58,356 --> 01:30:00,233
Oh, right. That.

530
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,736
A bloke wakes up with a hangover...

531
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:08,324
and thinks he's scored himself a
nice warm back to snuggle up to...

532
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:10,577
and then you know...

533
01:30:10,744 --> 01:30:12,287
Well you know...

534
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:15,415
I had a lot on my mind.

535
01:30:18,168 --> 01:30:19,753
Like now?

536
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:29,220
No. You know now,
now there's nothing.

537
01:31:54,431 --> 01:31:56,391
Nah, nah, don't you do it...

538
01:31:59,936 --> 01:32:01,771
So what'd he do to you?

539
01:32:03,857 --> 01:32:05,734
Freaked me out.

540
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:12,032
Remind me not to, eh?

541
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,495
You're such a smart arse.

542
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:22,834
Know any hymns?

543
01:32:24,252 --> 01:32:27,714
""Allthings bright and beautiful

544
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:31,968
Allcreatures great and small

545
01:32:32,927 --> 01:32:36,973
Allthings bright and qwonderful

546
01:32:37,682 --> 01:32:41,644
the Lord God made them all

547
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:47,025
He gave us eyes to see them

548
01:32:47,525 --> 01:32:52,030
And lips that qwe may tell

549
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:57,077
Hoqw great is God Almighty

550
01:32:57,535 --> 01:33:01,748
He made all things qwell.""

551
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:51,840
Something smells good.

552
01:33:57,595 --> 01:34:00,473
I could scrub
your back if you like.

553
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,785
Just there. Yip.

554
01:34:33,465 --> 01:34:35,091
No, thanks.

555
01:34:37,052 --> 01:34:39,929
-When did you say the baby was due?
-Soon.

556
01:34:41,264 --> 01:34:42,932
Lovely.

557
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:45,101
I don't get it.

558
01:34:45,352 --> 01:34:47,312
Bloody old Barnacle Bill, eh?

559
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:51,983
-Maybe he's good in bed.
-No, he's not.

560
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:56,404
-He's obviously been practicing.
-Why don't you give a speech?

561
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:03,787
Ah, thanks love...

562
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:11,002
Thank you all for coming today.
It's been a great day and...

563
01:35:11,336 --> 01:35:14,964
As you can tell,
I'm avery happy man.

564
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:18,176
Thank you to Burt and Nance...

565
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:22,722
for putting on this fine spread
that you see. It's pretty yummy.

566
01:35:24,474 --> 01:35:29,479
Been off the scene lately, but we'd
like to welcome to you all.

567
01:35:29,688 --> 01:35:34,067
Feel free to visit us over there.
The door's always open.

568
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:40,699
Thanks to Mum and Dad. Unfortunately
they can't be here today.

569
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:45,453
But if they hadn't done
a certain act a few years ago...

570
01:35:45,829 --> 01:35:47,706
I wouldn't be here either.

571
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:52,460
Drink up and have a good night.

572
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:55,547
And thanks to the
lovely bridesmaids.

573
01:35:56,172 --> 01:35:59,259
When I saw them all dressed
up in their finery...

574
01:35:59,509 --> 01:36:03,138
hard decision to make: "Which
one do I marry, you know??"'

575
01:36:04,556 --> 01:36:06,307
Think I've chosen the right one.
