00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,779
Things in my life
wasted with strangers

2
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:52,217
I was bottled up in
disposal  containers...

3
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:57,155
take one down and
I'm drinking alone.

4
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:02,094
take my memories and
call them your  own

5
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:03,795
I'll give you
every detail

6
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,897
every embarrassing
secret

7
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,166
all for the
killer in the name of

8
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,836
entertainment and love

9
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,407
in the end you got
nothing to keep

10
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,578
always watching just
makes you feel cheap

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,847
so don't look away

12
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:27,085
and don't look back

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,122

together for...

it used to be
the girl...

17
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:54,446
now it's
salvation in a day...

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,588
it's a way to give up
and say thanks

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,958
so don't look away

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,263
and don't look back

21
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:14,232

High school, noun,

27
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,108
A secondary school, especially,
in the United States,

28
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,211
Usually including
grades 9 through 12

29
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:02,914
And serving students from
about 14 to 18 years of age.

30
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,084
Typically, high school's offer
college preparatory classes

31
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,752
For advance students,

32
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,822
General education classes
for average students

33
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:15,860
And remedial courses
for those who are struggling.

34
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,967
Hey!

35
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,869
Hey.

[bell rings]

38
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,545
Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to high school.

39
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,748
Here's the syllabus.

40
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,751
Now, we're gonna take
about 15 minutes

41
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,486
And go through it,

42
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:18,923
So you don't have to worry about
asking any questions right now.

43
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:20,425
Okay.

44
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,428
Yes?

45
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,764
This says we have
to keep a diary.

46
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,165
Yes, a journal.

47
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,067
It is required.
It's 10 of your grade.

48
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,236
A journal about what?

49
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,838
About anything.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
You can write about
the day you're having,

51
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,443
A conversation you had
with your mom or your sister,

52
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,778
Whatever you want.

53
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,013
And I'll only read the pages
that you want me to read.

54
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,648
If you write something
that's too personal

55
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,016
And you don't want me
to read it,

56
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,985
Just fold the page over and
write "please do not read this"

57
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,821
And I won't read it.

58
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,792
Let's get it started.

59
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:58,730
The first part of the syllabus
is called the requirements.

60
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,599
Now don't throw
your syllabus away

61
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,936
Because you need to refer to it
throughout the course, okay?

62
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,406
Thuman.

63
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,242

Here, sir.

66
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,349
You have five minutes from
the bell to get ready, got it?

last night?

Yeah, dude.

71
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,996
How was school today?

72
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,273
Did you make
any new friends?

73
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,308
No, I didn't make
any friends...

74
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,377
Guess I wasn't cool enough.

75
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,891

78
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,564
<i>Because your class
is right after lunch.</i>

<i>I wanna sit in the back,</i>

80
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,300
<i>So you don't have
to constantly hear,</i>

00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,502
<i>"we can't see around Jimmy."</i>

82
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,346
<i>And I don't get teachers.</i>

83
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,616
<i>Why do you guys pile it
on the first day of school?</i>

84
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,518
<i>Can't you let us get use
to the idea that Summer</i>

85
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,687
<i>Is really over?</i>

86
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,859
<i>Three half pages a week
is tough.</i>

87
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,527
<i>Why don't you
just ask us to write</i>

88
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,530
<i>The great American novel
and say it's due in June?</i>

89
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,605
<i>New school sucked.</i>

90
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,907
<i>Except for leaving
Paul I'm glad we moved.</i>

91
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,710
<i>And then, I'm in high school,</i>

92
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,411
<i>Maybe things will
be different,</i>

93
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,247
<i>At least, I hope so.</i>

94
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,901
<i>I don't know anyone here
except for Nate.</i>

<i>Went to elementary school
together.</i>

<i>Didn't think
I'd ever see him again.</i>

she goes here ,too.</i>

with the new school.</i>

people here.</i>

00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,944
Hey, guys, I
was thinking,

182
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,147

change our mascot

183
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,483

We've got our
homework out.

188
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,275

studying the chapter

and compounds,

to know where we are.

191

Hey, Jimmy, did you do
your homework last night?

192
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,784
I need to make sure
I got mine right.

193
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:46,290
Well, hand it over.
I wanna make sure.

194
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,358
Yeah man?

195
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,693
Mr. Larson, does this
honestly look right to you?

196
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,296
Yeah, that looks fine.
You're doing great.

197
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,066
Okay, you're all set.
Winterpock?

198
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,069
What's the definition
of a compound?

199
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,538
Uh, compounds, um--

200
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,541
[stutters]
it's, uh, when...

201
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,378
Two elements combine.

202

did you do your homework?

203
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,883
Yes, sir.

204
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,418
Where is it?
Did your dog eat it?

205
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,187
No, sir, it's, um,

206
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,755
I just don't have it
with me.

207
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,323
Well, when you get it back,

208
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,524
I don't want it.

209
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,093
You can keep it.

210
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,296
But, anyway, let's not forget
Monday, we've got a lab, okay?

211
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,331
Bring all your stuff--
I wasn't finished.

212

you knucklehead.

213
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,968
That's a detention.

214
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,004
I will see you after school.

215
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,939
All right. Let's go.
Let's go over the homework

216

actually brought

217

I couldn't
rat her out, mom.

219
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,214
She copied your homework
and you protected her. Why?

220
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,882
I don't know.
She's my friend.

221
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,118
Well, you need better friends.

222
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,419
She's really cool.

223
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,686
She'd probably
just got home late

224
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,255
From cheerleading practice
or something.

225
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,991
Well, okay, I guess you
can't rat out your friends.

Hi Jimmy,
I'm Dr. Jeffords.

248
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,994
It says here we're doing
your annual checkup.

249
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,363
Yeah, I guess.

this year?

251
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,968
Um, no,

252
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,870
But I'm in the
jazz band.

253
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,340
See what I'm going to
do is check your lungs.

254
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,109
What I want you to do is
take in a deep breath for me.

255
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,014
Breathe in.

256
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,550

Jimmy, do you ever find
yourself getting winded

261
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,830
Or tired or
short of breath

262
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,799
For no reason?

263
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,103
Um, not really.

264
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,173
Maybe a little.

265
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,341

Everything at school okay?

268
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,480
School's okay.

269
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,685
Well, you know, I guess things
could be a bit better.

270
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,822
Yeah? How's so?

271
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,492
Well, it's kinda hard
to make friends.

272
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,728
Yeah, school can be tough.

273
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,364
Jimmy, it says here
that you're 14.

274
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,467
Yes, sir.

275
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,502
You're 188 pounds.

276
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,640
Well, I guess,
I'm a bit overweight.

277

278
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,454
Except for a few
and my teacher,

279
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,858
They say things,

280
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,762
Mean things.

281
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:23,534
Jimmy.

282
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,036
I was picked on
a lot when I was a kid.

283
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,539
The jocks and
the cool kids,

284
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,841
They were
always teasing me.

285
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:35,513
And I didn't know
how to deal with the pain.

286
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,681
And so, I'd eat.

287
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,884
I'd eat when I was happy,
I eat when I was sad,

288
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:44,721
Even when I
was bored.

289
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,858
And no matter what,
I was always left feeling

290
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,394
Empty.

291
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,429
Do you know
what I'm trying to say?

292
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:59,236
I'm sure you are a great kid.

293
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,672
Obesity is a fat kid.

294
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:10,614
Truth is if you don't
lose the weight,

295
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,350
It will never stop.

296
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,820
And believe me, that will be
the least of your troubles.

297
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,056
I promise you that.

00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,654
Hey, he's kicking
your butt right now.

358
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,856
You suck!

359
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,925
What does she look like?

360
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:58,395
Well, she has
a black sweater,

361
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,264
Black shirt,
black shoes--

362
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,333
What are you in love
with Darth Vader?

363
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,776
So is she, you know--

364
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,244
What?

365
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,781
You know, big, like you?

366
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,950
Actually, no.

367
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,618
She's actually thin.

368
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,555
Probably too thin, though.

369
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,557
That could be a problem.

370
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,292
Even for
the master of love.

371
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:33,396
<i>[voice from pa] attention,
a reminder to all students--</i>

372
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,799
Hey, Sable,
did you see the news?

373
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,067
About that girl?

374
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,835
That's where I used to live.

375
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,604
Maybe she just ran away,

376
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,706
Maybe she got
so sick of everyone

377
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,107
That she had to leave
or she knew--

378
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,742
Alright, um,

379
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,277
So are you going
to the game tonight?

380
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,212
Football's
for Neanderthals.

381
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,381
Yeah, but it's homecoming.

382
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,017
Allen will be there.

383
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,852
We could see
the freshman float.

384
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,589
Makes it even worse.

385
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:05,462
[cheers]

386
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,363
<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope,
guess what?</i>

387
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,366
<i>Sable went with me and Allen
to the homecoming parade.</i>

388
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,335
<i>The theme
was "reach for the stars,"</i>

389
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,570
<i>But it should've been</i>

390
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,107
<i>"let's boo and terrorize
the freshman float."</i>

391
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,609
<i>I almost caught one
of those little footballs</i>

392
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,443
<i>That cheerleaders throw
into the crowd</i>

393
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,412
<i>And I met the mayor.</i>

394
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,315
<i>And even though Sable
doesn't really like football,</i>

395
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,217
<i>I still think
she's pretty cool.</i>

396
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,653
[cheers]

397
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:33,490
You know, if you ever wanna
talk about being euphemistic,

398
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,626
I'm a good listener.

399
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,461
That's so sweet.

400
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,270
<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope,
today was pretty good.</i>

401
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,505
<i>Man, I'm so--</i>

402
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,606
<i>Did you see
the game last night?</i>

403
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,041
<i>Fingers hurt from playing
guitar hero.</i>

404
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,342
<i>I have a lot to say, but--</i>

405
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,410
<i>Mr. Larson is crazy.</i>

406
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,446
<i>Don't tell him that, though.</i>

<i>Please don't read this page.</i>

408
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,916
<i>Man, I tell you I wish
I was an only child.</i>

<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope,
please don't read this page.</i>

410
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,219
<i>I feel alone.
I am alone.</i>

411
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,621
<i>I wish I could be invisible.</i>

412
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,023
<i>Does anyone care?
They have everything.</i>

413
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,124
<i>I am invisible.</i>

414
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,659
<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope,
today was sunny.</i>

415
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,060
<i>What's the point
of playing the game</i>

416
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,328
<i>If there are cheat codes.
I don't ever understand Sable.</i>

417
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,697
<i>I have to study.
Today was hot.</i>

418
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,331
<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope,
please don't read this page.</i>

419

<i>Kids make fun of me.
School sucks.</i>

423
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,141
<i>Does it ever get better?
Those kids are hard--</i>

424
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,776
<i>Please don't read this page.
School sucks.</i>

425
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,577
<i>I don't feel like writing.
School sucks.</i>

426
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,445
<i>School sucks.
School sucks.</i>

427
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,847
<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope,
I made an a.</i>

428
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,050
<i>It was cold.
I was up all-night studying.</i>

429
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,617
<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope,
today was rainy.</i>

430
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,953
<i>Hey, Mrs. Pope--</i>

431
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:43,026
[guitar playing]

432
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,976
Did you jog this morning?

433
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,712
I've lost 14 pounds.

434
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:02,879
Really?

435
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,480
That is great, Jimmy.

436
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,816
Alright. I have to head
to the airport.

437
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,283
I'll see you guys
in a few days, hmm?

438
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:11,788
This is gonna be fun.

439
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,592
Alright. And, yes,
this counts as a test grade.

440
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,694
Alright. And look,
you can work with a partner,

441
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,395
You can work by yourself

442
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,099
Or if you're schizophrenic,
you can do both.

443
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,666
Yes?

444
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,501
Are these traps new?

445
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,636
Yeah, most of them.

446
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,971
Some of them
might be leftover

447
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,807
From last year's
cafeteria catastrophe.

448
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,542
Oh!

449
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,910
I'm just kidding.

450
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,980
Alright. So anyway,
everybody gets a new mousetrap.

451
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,549
Alright.
Farthest car wins.

452
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,753
And you've got to be careful,
these things are dangerous.

453
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,354
Jimmy, can I be your partner?

454
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,522
No!

455
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:54,131
Oh!

456
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,900
[bell rings]

457
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,468
So how about
this weekend?

458
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,870
Friday night?

459
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,272
I'll think about it.

460
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,742
Hey, Jimmy, coach says he needs
a trainer for the team.

461
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,578
What do you say?
You wanna give it a shot?

462
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,980
Okay.

463
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,282
After school, you gotta
come down to the locker room

464
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,817
And meet some of the guys.

465
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,185
Why?

466
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,888
Uh, you got to talk to coach,
see what you have to do.

467
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,555
It won't take long.

468
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,057
Friday?

469
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,093
Maybe.

470
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,901
Watch this.

471
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,069
Okay, let's go.

472
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,737
Go!

473
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,407
Yeah! Whoo!

474
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:40,376
Go! Go!

475
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:45,581
[clapping and cheering]]

476
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,885
Whoo! Yeah!

477
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,520
That's right.

478
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,622
Man, that guy was crazy.

479
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,025
Yeah, and he's training
for the team.

480
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,429
Oh, no! I'm not doing that.

481
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,698
Come on, don't worry.

482
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:21,384
Open.

483
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,586
Open the door.

484
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,464
Please.

485
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:38,068
Open the door, please.

486
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,170
Please.

487
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:46,877
[crying]

488
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,700
Hello, Winterpock.
There's no one here.

489
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:22,913
Hang in there.

490
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,982
Maybe they'll
grow up one day.

491
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,351
I did.

492
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:32,522
You keep doing
what you're doing.

493
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,959
Don't think
I haven't noticed.

494
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,228
You'll be alright.

495
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,564
Come on.

496
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,599
Let's go.

497
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,573
How could you do that?

498
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,874
It was funny.

499
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,009
And Jimmy's okay with it.

500
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,044
How would you know?

501
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:58,114
When have you
ever been made fun of?

502
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,791
You didn't
have to do that.

503
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,928
Yes, I did.

504
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,667
And I will never go out
with a jerk like you!

505
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,105
I think I'm gonna
invite Sable to church.

506
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,442
Yeah, man,
I wanna check her out.

507
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:29,512
Okay, okay,
no checking.

508
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,847
So how's school?

509
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,449
Uh, you know,
not much different.

510
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,717
My teachers suck.

511
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,053
Someone told me you've got
suspended for a couple of days.

512
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,421
Who?

513
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,689
Well...

514
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,024
Well, what?

515
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,493
Did you get suspended.

516
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:48,564
Man, bet your mom freaked.

517
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,933
My mom?

518
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,735
She was so drunk
when the principal called

519
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,872
That she didn't even remember
by the time I got home.

520
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,073
I left every morning

521
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,775
And acted like
I was going to school.

522
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,480
Whoa! My mom would kill me.

523
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,815
Twice.

524
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:23,666
What you writing about?

525
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,101
Stuff.

526
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:29,072
School, nothing, really.
Why?

527
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,474
What time?

528
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,808
For what?

529
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,779
At church on Wednesday,
you asked me to go with you.

530
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,515
You can go?

531
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,150
We'll be reading this
for the next month.

532
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:43,686
Have the first chapter
read by Monday.

533
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,789
Where do you live?
We'll come by and get you.

534
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:56,399
[music]

535
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,413
Can you believe it,
she said she'll go.
Cool.

536
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,683
She can witness your utter
destruction in foosball

537
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,386
Whatever.

538
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,354
Anyways, um...

539
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,023
What--what's it like
to kiss a girl?

540
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:24,527
Hey, I read this.

541
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,028
Guess what they're
gonna call you?

542
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,432
I know.
I saw it on page 5.

543
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,367
Can't wait.

544
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,436
You know, I think my dad
might lose his job.

545
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,704
Oh, man.

546
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,872
Yeah.

547
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,976
Looks like I might have
to live with my uncle.

548
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:44,647
He's even a bigger
drunk than my dad.

549
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,584
The good news is
he lives close here.

550
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,619
Cool.

551
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,494
You know, they still haven't
found out who killed that girl.

552
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:58,528
I don't care
what they say.

553
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,464
It's not the boyfriend.

554
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,667
I say we get the killer.

555
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,503
What do you mean
"get?"

556
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:09,539
You know,
like lore him out.

557
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:15,778
Do you have any pictures
of your sister?

558
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,449
Oh, and about kissing Sable,
it's nice.

559
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,018
You should try it.

560
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,553
And now, Sable,

561
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,421
You have to watch me
kill Jimmy in foosball.

562
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,623
Foosball...

563
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,026
I will own you
at foosball.

564
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,795
[laughter]

565
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:42,805
Come on, Jimmy.

566
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,475
No.

567
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:50,079
I win.

568
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,714
He let you win.

569
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,949
Jimmy is nice like that,
but I'm not.

570
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,385
Move, loser.

571
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,820
Bring it on.

572
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:16,306
What happened
to your arms?

573
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,076
How did you get
all those cuts?

574
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,381
Hey, guys.

575
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,516
Are you all ready?

576
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,951
Hear you're going
with us. Yeah.

577
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,554
Warm enough in there?

578
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:40,396
[music]

579
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,681
<i>Dear Mrs. Pope,</i>

580
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,618
<i>Life is hard.</i>

581
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,937
Piggy.

582
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:27,877
Piggy! Piggy!

583
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:35,718
Piggy! Piggy!

584
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,220
Piggy! Piggy!

585
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,455
Piggy! Piggy!

586
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,757
Piggy! Piggy...

587
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,506
Wait a minute.

588
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:04,714
I don't know about this.

589
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:05,748
How do you know
it'll work?

590
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,784
Everybody's on MySpace.

591
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,952
Besides, she's so hot,
or will be.

592
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,354
Photoshop is great.

593
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,055
Photoshop?

594
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,627
Yeah, man, she'll have
a huge rack, big lips,

595
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,296
Tough looking, sexy.

596
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,664
Oh, my God, I'm dead.

597
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,367
We're good.
We're smart.

598
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,168
Oh, and
what's her name?

599
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,642
Starr?

600
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,711
Dude, she look--

601
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,045
She looks like a hooker.

602
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,013
Kidnappers like hookers.

603
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,249
Look, if we don't get a bite
in a couple of weeks,

604
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,517
Then I'll take it off.

605
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,785
Couple of weeks?

606
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,822
Relax.
You worry too much.

607
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,191
[bell ringing]

608
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:59,369
[music]

609
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,637
No, I haven't
given up pizza.

610
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,640
I've been--
working out, right?

611
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,385
Who did this?

612
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:17,787
You've got to
answer to me.

613
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:23,760
my love's like
a boomerang

614
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:26,462
my love's like
a boomerang

615
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,230
boom boom,
right at you

616
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,868
my love's like
a boomerang...

617
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,609
Holy... I'm...

618
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,377
They're all over school.

619
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,547
Who would do this?
You're so sweet.

620
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,482
I can't go back.

621
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,619
That's awful.

622
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,887
Great picture, though.

623
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,655
Mom, make him shut up.

624
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,724
Stop it, Jimmy!

625
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,960
I've got homework.

626
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,533
Hey, um--

627
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:06,569
I might have
to join the circus,

628
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,371
Or run away
or both.

629
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,773
Cool.
Can I go?

630
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,577
Dude, I'm gonna be grounded
'til I graduate.

631
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,313
Okay, okay.

632
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,015
Hey, guess what...

633
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,419
And somebody wrote
on Starrs MySpace.

634
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,955
They wanna meet her.

635
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,257
Wow.

636
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,258
When?
This Thursday.

637
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,394
Right here
at the grill.

638
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,196
Can you believe it?

639
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,604
[laughter]

640
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,241
[background chatter]

641
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:52,181
Next week, we'll be
starting my favorite play,

642
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,983
And we'll be acting
it out in class.

643
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,150
This play is so cool.

644
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:58,020
I empathize with
the character Juliet.

645
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,422
So we have our Juliet.

646
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,457
Any guys for Romeo?

647
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:05,528
Hey, Jimmy.
Jimmy.

648
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,596
Anyone?

649
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,030
No one volunteers,

650
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,866
I'm just gonna have
to pick someone.

651
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:32,622
Hey.

652
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:36,492
Um, can you go to church
with me again?

653
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:55,477
Ah, geez.
Don't do that.

654
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,913
Stop playing
with the camera.

655
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:58,313
Now, I can't see.

656
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,882
Gotta go run in the corner
and act like I don't know him.

657
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,051
Would you stop
being so jumpy.

658
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,452
You really are gonna
give us away.

659
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,655
Besides, the guy is looking
for a girl named Starr.

660
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,690
Is that you?
No, but--

661
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,793
And remember,
she has big, you know?

662
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:13,228
Uh, nothing.

663
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,798
Are you almost ready?
It's 5.

664
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,306
He's cautious,
just like us.

665
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:28,844
Not cautious, nervous
and hungry.

666
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,379
What kind of
a stakeout guy are you?

667
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,581
Not very good.

668
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,649
And don't say stake,
you know, I'm--

669
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,653
What kind of hat
does Todd going to wear?

670
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,322
A blue baseball hat.

671
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,424
Oh, man, that's Todd.
Ah, what's he doing here?

672
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,793
He lives here, remember?

673
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,963
Oh, my God.

674
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,903
Holy crap.
What's she doing here?

675
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:04,680
They're going
to ruin our plan.

676
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,717
The murderer will see Jessica
and think it's Starr.

677
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,152
What if he's starts talking
to her-- she's my sister.

678
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,355
She's safer than we are.
She's with a bunch of guys.

679
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,757
How long are we gonna be
in here?

680
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:18,060
Not long,
as soon as they leave.

681
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,739
Ahem.

682
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:32,307
Uh, taken.

683
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,182
[makes farting sound]

684
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,417
Oh!

685
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,754
Good luck, dude.
That burned.

686
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:49,759
Ow.

687
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,027
Ow.

688
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:55,297
[makes farting sound]

689
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:01,603
They're just
sitting there.

690
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,606
It was a set up.
Oh, man.

691
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,309
We might never
get out of here.

692
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:18,154
Um, I didn't know
what time it was.

693
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,855
So with all those people
around you,

694
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,190
You couldn't ask?

695
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,858
It was your bike
outside the grill.

696
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,126
No, it wasn't mine.

697
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,095
We kept dinner warm
for an hour.

698
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,797
I'm calling Paul's dad.
No.

699
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:28,798
He'll get yelled at
big time.

700
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,465
You didn't know
what time it was?

701
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,401
I've got some homework
I need to do.

702
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,537
We're not finish here,
young man.

703
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,716
[knocking on door]

704
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:52,554
Hey pal.

705
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,423
How are the workouts going?

706
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,825
Okay.

707
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:58,260
Hey, can I go
to Paul's house tonight?

708
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:01,463
I thought you said Paul's family
was living with his uncle?

709
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:06,335
Well, yeah,
but they're cool with it.

710
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:09,438
I guess you've earned it.
Don't be up late.

711
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,108
We're going
to church tomorrow.

712
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:17,146
[video game noises]

713
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,214
I got it, dude,
you've got to let me play--

714
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,315
Hang on, I got one.
Great, then, grenade me.

715
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,351
You're getting Dusty--
how are you losers doing?

716
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,653
Are you watching
"American idol" reruns?

717
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:33,796
So, Jimmy, how's school?

718
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,064
It's okay.

719
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:39,301
Okay. I hope you're doing
better than Paul.

720
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,104
Hey, do me a favor.
I need a favor.

721
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,372
Could you try
to send some

722
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:46,508
Of your smarts
Paul's way.

723
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,280
Thanks.

724
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:52,848
Sorry.

725
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,919
Sometimes
he can be nice.

726
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:10,699
Hey, man, check this out.

727
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,435
No, man.
You know I don't do that.

728
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,503
Let's get out of here.

729
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,471
You mean like, like out?

730
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,539
Yeah, man.

731
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,810
Our parents are gonna be
sleeping in a minute.

732
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,077
My mom's not gonna wake up
'til tomorrow

733
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,213
And dad won't--
he's not gonna care.

734
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,981
I can't.

735
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,649
Fine. Then just sit here.

736
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,584
I'm going to a party
down the street.

737
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:33,189
Maybe I should just
call my dad.

738
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:35,757
We won't be gone
30 minutes.

739
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,261
I promise.

740
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,629
Come on.

741
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,866
You know some
of the folks there.

742
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:46,836
Jimmy, you're my
best friend. Come on.

743
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,604
I--

744
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,274
Hey, Sable might be there.

745
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:58,881
Alright, 30 minutes.

746
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:00,449
But I ain't smoking.

747
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:04,453
No smoking, 30 minutes.
I promise.

748
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:15,630
Dude, dude, I thought
you said no smoking.

749
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:19,134
I didn't know you meant
me too, whatever.

750
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,502
I don't know.

751
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,503
I do.

752
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,239
I hate it at my house.

753
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:27,076
I'm going to this party.

754
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:30,045
You know what, every second
I'm not at home is a good one.

755
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,552
Cool.

756
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,454
Look, you'll have fun.

757
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,455
It will help you
out with those guys.

758
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,124
You know,
you won't be Jimmy

759
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:44,726
That fat kid at
school anymore.

760
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,696
Come on.

761
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,631
Hey, man.
Hey, how is it going?

762
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:50,966
Come on in.

763
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,067
Wait, wait.

764
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,104
He's with me.
He's good.

765
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,539
what's up babe?

766
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,942
what's up babe?

767
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,610
what's up babe?

768
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,779
getting money like
it ain't no thang.

769
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,047
see me sliding
down the street

770
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,548
they say what's
up babe?

771
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:13,355
Who are you?
Um, I'm Paul's friend.

772
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,457
Great.

773
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,293
Who are you?

774
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:20,195
Jimmy--Winterpock.

775
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,431
He's busy.

776
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,466
can I get back
and reload

777
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,802
everybody
wants my...

778
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,571
but everybody
can't deal with...

779
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,974
ain't nobody
else come up...

780
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:33,342
got to smash up
like somebody

781
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,877
all the time

782
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,279
what's up babe?

783
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,347
Jimmy!

784
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,149
What are you doing here?

785
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,151
I never thought
I'd see you.

786
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:43,385
Um, I can't drink.

787
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,788
Hey, I thought your
mousetrap...

788
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,092
Look who's here,
piggy!

789
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:53,228
Is he hitting on you?
Are you bothering her?

790
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,863
No. We we're just--
we we're talking about school.

791
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:58,800
Hey, guys, Jimster was comparing
his boobs to Whitney.

792
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,569
He says his are bigger.

793
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:04,106
Oh, yeah?
I bet mine are.

794
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,375
Whitney! Whitney!

795
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,310
Whitney! Whitney!

796
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,846
[cheers]

797
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:13,048
Your turn, piggy.

798
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,020
Piggy wins
biggest boobs.

799
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:18,620
[laughter]

800
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,955
Awesome!

801
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,025
ready to roll

802
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:23,959
I pull up on
the block

803
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,028
and you all
lose control

804
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,365
[crickets chirping]

805
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:41,110
What are you stupid?

806
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:42,878
How could you do
something like this?

807
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,678
[screaming and crying]

808
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,083
What did I tell you?

809
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,752
[screaming]
[punching sounds]

810
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,921
I hate you!
Hold a second, huh!

811
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,123
How can you be
so stupid?

812
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,458
Who do you think
I learned it from?

813
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,959
You,
my alcoholic parents!

814
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,295
I don't need you, I don't need
the police in my door.

815
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,398
Stop!
Let him go, you...

816
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:07,936
That's great.

817
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,838
Now you've got your
fat friend defending you.

818
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,407
Wow.

819
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,742
Lucky you.
Dad, don't.

820
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:26,321
[crying]

821
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:39,834
Did something happen
last night at Paul's?

822
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:43,972
Just his dad's such a jerk.

823
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:50,579
Uh, people are mean because
they don't like themselves.

824
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:13,668
[music]

825
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,450
Winterpock!

826
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,652
What's wrong with you?

827
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:06,188
I'm okay, just tired.

828
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,089
I didn't get much sleep
last weekend.

829
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,625
I volunteered you
for a project.

830
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,992
A new student
needs some help.

831
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,262
And since you're the best in
here, I didn't think you'd mind.

832
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:15,330
Who, sir?
I don't see anybody new.

833
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,700
How about this, Robb Thuman,
star quarterback.

834
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,002
Oh, no.

835
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,872
Alright, everybody,
turn to page 85.

836
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,882
Why wouldn't you
play Romeo?

837
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,518
I don't know.

838
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,753
Maybe because I hate getting up
in front of everybody.

839
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,522
That's why.

840
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,724
Why do you cut yourself?

841
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,527
Why do you think
I cut myself?

842
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:49,064
'cause I like it?
'cause I enjoy it?

843
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:55,770
I do 'cause I'm dying inside.
Does that answer your question?

844
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:59,208
You think you're the only one?

845
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,442
I went to a party
last weekend,

846
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,277
And everybody said
I had a bigger chest

847
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,213
Than most of
the girls there.

848
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:06,114
How do you think
that made me feel?

849
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,084
Now everybody in school
knows about it.

850
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:10,151
Don't talk to me
about your problems.

851
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,186
At least you're not fat.

852
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,355
You don't get it,
do you?

853
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,057
You think it's all about
the way you look?

854
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,126
Let me tell you something,
Jimmy Winterpock.

855
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:22,063
There are way worse things
than being fat!

856
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,366
Some of us have scars
that can't be healed

857
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:28,136
By running around
the block.

858
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,405
Grow up, Jimmy!

859
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:33,141
You think you're
the only one with problems?

860
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:37,746
Everyone's gonna forget
about that stupid party.

861
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:40,048
I thought you were cool.

862
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,485
That you got it.

863
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:47,256
Boy, was I stupid.

864
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:55,063
"the pile of guts
was a black blob of flies

865
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,931
That buzzed
like a saw.

866
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,434
After a while,
these flies found Simon.

867
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:03,171
Gorged, they alighted by his
runnels of sweat and drink.

868
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,373
They tickled under his nostrils

869
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,975
And played leapfrog
on his thighs.

870
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,977
They were black
and iridescent green

871
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,179
And without number;

872
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,281
And in front of Simon,

873
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,784
The Lord of Flies hung
on his stick and grinned.

874
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:18,353
At last, Simon gave up
and looked back.

875
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:23,792
Saw the white teeth
and dim eyes, the blood,

876
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:25,727
And his gaze was held
by that ancient,

877
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,497
Inescapable recognition."

878
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:34,002
and on and on the
road she goes

879
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:39,308
secret even
time don't know

880
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:44,513
and time and
time her paramour

881
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:50,485
will take his
weight in gold

882
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,120
Oh, no.

883
00:54:56,058 --> 00:55:01,963
And nobody knows
where he is?

884
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,333
Okay, we will.

885
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,401
Who is it?

886
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:12,441
Jimmy, I've got some bad news.

887
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:15,109
Paul's dad is dead.

888
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,611
He committed suicide.

889
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,513
Oh, my God!

890
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,215
And Paul's gone?

891
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:22,283
Yeah.

892
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,152
Wh--where's Paul?

893
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,254
Nobody knows.

[music]

895
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:48,477
it's better to
be born lucky

896
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:52,146
<i>It's okay if you
read this, Mrs. Pope.</i>

897
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,417
<i>My friend Paul is gone.</i>

898
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:58,453
<i>Nobody knows where he is.</i>

899
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,889
He ran away after his dad died.

900
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:05,326
<i>They never got along but I know
how much Paul wanted his dad</i>

901
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,430
<i>To love him.</i>

902
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,998
<i>He used to tell me
how they were gonna go</i>

903
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,067
<i>To a baseball game together.</i>

904
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,303
<i>But they never did.</i>

905
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:19,741
<i>Now, they never will.</i>

906
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,943
<i>There is a quote one day,</i>

907
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,179
<i>"nothing endures, not a tree</i>

908
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:29,984
<i>Not love, not death
or violence."</i>

909
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:31,653
<i>Now I know what it means.</i>

910
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:34,188
<i>And how it feels.</i>

911
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,357
<i>The world is different,</i>

912
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,727
<i>And I'm worried
about my friends.</i>

913
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:42,864
<i>There's nothing
I can do about it.</i>

914
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:47,235
[knocks]

915
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,604
Hey, buddy.

916
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,981
How about we
go for a run?

917
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,350
It might make
you feel better.

918
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,619
I don't know.

919
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:07,889
Not right now.

920
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,325
Well, I'm here
if you want to.

921
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,698
Um--

922
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,801
Why don't you invite Sable
to church on Sunday?

923
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:30,545
... I left my heart

924
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,581
but a picture
of Jesus

925
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:36,685
that covers a crack
in the wall

926
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,029
Alright, look.

927
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,230
This doesn't change anything.

928
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,866
You get bragging
points and I get to pass

929
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:53,101
This stupid class.

930
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,937
Well, that's a good start.

931
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,171
Come on.

932
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,875
I don't want everybody knowing
I'm getting help from you.

933
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:13,522
Oh!

934
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:18,860
Uh!

935
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,294
Who am I kidding?

936
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,930
I'm not going to college.

937
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,132
Listen, we all have
something that's hard,

938
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:25,233
That we'd rather not deal with.

939
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,902
I don't need you
lecturing me.

940
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,004
I'll go home if I
want that.

941
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,440
Who are you to tell me
things are hard?

942
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,441
What?

943
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,443
We're not that different,
you and I.

944
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,078
And you need me.

945
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,514
You need to pass math.

946
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:53,394
Alright, then.

947
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,396
Let's go coach Winterpock.

948
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:59,367
Give me question 1.

949
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,556
We've got a call
from Paul's grandmother.

950
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,524
He's in Colorado.

951
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:25,093
Colorado?

952
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:26,360
Headed west probably.

953
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,296
Well, that's Paul.

954
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,364
He always said he would try
to get as far away as possible.

955
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:33,034
But there's been an accident.
Paul's been hurt.

956
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:36,037
We don't know how badly.

957
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,271
He was my best friend.

958
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,074
Hey.

959
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,442
He still is pal.

960
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:44,012
And I'm sure
you're still his, too.

961
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:46,147
And he's gonna need you more
than ever when he comes home

962
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,182
In a couple of weeks, okay?

963
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,551
Come here.
Let's go.

964
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,957
Hey, Robb.

965
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,492
What do you want?

966
00:59:57,494 --> 00:59:59,193
Uh, how's it going?

967
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,363
Fat freshmen are not
allowed to talk to me.

968
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,565
How are things going
on with Robb?

969
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,035
Great.
He's getting better.

970
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:12,107
bring me down...

971
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,608
my girlfriend tried
to tell me...

972
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:18,379
she said boy you
better make a plan

973
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:23,652
...Cause I won't let
you bring me down

974
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:31,693
on and on and
on and on and on...

975
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:45,239
Failure is an inevitable
part of life.

976
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:49,610
It does not mean
that we are defeated forever

977
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,880
Or that we should give up.

978
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:54,248
Failure is a mystery,

979
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,318
And it is even divine.

980
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,523
It humbles us and it makes us
more compassionate to others.

981
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,330
It often is God's way of
leading us to our true selves

982
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:13,768
Or to a better position
in our lives.

983
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,571
How often have you
heard someone say,

984
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:20,942
"it's a good thing I didn't
get that job or promotion

985
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:24,412
Or scholarship or whatever?"

986
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:29,884
Some experiences that seem like
tragedies at the moment

987
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:34,555
Lead us to opportunities that we
would have not found otherwise.

988
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,024
Amen!

989
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:40,095
There is no way that
we can know and love God

990
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:45,166
Except through the discovery
of human intimacy and community.

991
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,871
We must open our souls

992
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,674
To the love
that humanity offers.

993
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,676
Everyday,

994
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,578
Every hour,

995
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,749
Every moment is sacred...
I heard about Paul?

996
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:04,518
And we must embrace life...
Where have you been?

997
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,923
As if it is both
fragile and strong.

998
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,961
I had to get better.
[preacher continues]

999
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:17,165
He will turn our failures
into success.

1000
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:20,668
I know you tried
to be a good person

1001
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,571
And people picked on you
because of how you look.

1002
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,808
[preacher continues on]

1003
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,944
You're the bravest person
I know, Jimmy Winterpock.

1004
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:33,714
And we are all tested.

1005
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:39,187
But how you respond
will define your life.

1006
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:44,458
Giving up is easy.

1007
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,163
Getting back up is hard.

1008
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,331
(all) Amen!

1009
01:03:04,646 --> 01:03:08,016
<i>For five months, the boyfriend
was the primary suspect.</i>

1010
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:10,351
<i>However, recent evidence
has led police to arrest</i>

1011
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,621
<i>Kimberly's councilor,
Jeffrey Hickman.</i>

1012
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,257
I know it was you.

1013
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,458
What?

1014
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,295
Starr.

1015
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:25,399
I'm sorry.

1016
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,535
I know.

1017
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,208
Winterpock!

1018
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,812
Hey, we've got a test
today in math.

1019
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,013
Yeah, I know.

1020
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,149
Can we go to the library
during homeroom?

1021
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,117
With me, a fat freshman?

1022
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,820
Yeah, with you, fat freshman.

1023
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,958
Yeah, well, I don't think I
can be seen with a dumb jock.

1024
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,492
I'm just kidding.

1025
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,527
Oh, really?
Really.

1026
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,730
Alright, I'll see you
in the library.

1027
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:03,637
If I profane with my unworth--

1028
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:08,176
Unworthiest hand
this holy shrine,

1029
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,711
The gentle sin is this,

1030
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:14,682
My lips, two blushing
pilgrims ready stand

1031
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,152
To smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss--

1032
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:21,055
[laughs]

1033
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,790
I quit.
These words are screwy.

1034
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,126
Ryan, it's okay.
Just try it again.

1035
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:28,396
I don't want to do it.

1036
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:31,565
Alright, settle down.
Settle down.

1037
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,902
Does anyone want
to play Romeo?

1038
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,604
Alright, it's about time
to go, anyway.

1039
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,439
You guys think about it.

1040
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:41,976
You should do it.

1041
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,280
Me?
Yeah, you. Romeo.

1042
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:48,149
Some girls might
find you Romeo-mantic.

1043
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,417
Is that even a word?

1044
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:50,584
Are you?

1045
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:51,619
Am I what?

1046
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,755
Romantic?

1047
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:59,527
Oh, fair Sable, you are cern'ly
grapes in Waldorf salad.

1048
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,362
Uh, Mrs. Pope,

1049
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,798
Jimmy would like to play Romeo.

1050
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:11,672
O, then, dear saint,

1051
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:15,243
Let lips do what hands do;

1052
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:25,420
Okay, that's it for today.

1053
01:05:26,922 --> 01:05:29,023
Nice job.

1054
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,992
Alright, for homework--

1055
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:32,393
Finish reading act 1
and act 2,

1056
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,628
And don't forget
your test in two weeks.

1057
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:37,798
Hey, piggy!

1058
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,300
[locker slams]

1059
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,002
I saw your Juliet
tried to kiss you.

1060
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,537
But you turned away.

1061
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:44,672
[locker slams again]

1062
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,574
What are you
afraid of girls?

1063
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,577
You're not afraid of little
debbies are you, fat boy?

1064
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,985
I'd love to kiss her for you.

1065
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,389
Hey!

1066
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:04,092
You leave him alone.
Go pick on someone else.

1067
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,060
[locker slams]

1068
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:10,198
Actually, next time I see you
bother anyone, you bother me.

1069
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,333
Do you understand?

1070
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,435
I said, do you understand?

1071
01:06:18,573 --> 01:06:20,441
Thanks.

1072
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,580
Fat freshman or not,
you're my friend.

1073
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,051
Are you alright?

1074
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,423
Come on.

1075
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:50,971
[breathing]

1076
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,140
What?

1077
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:54,675
Paul's grandmother called.
He's home.

1078
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,245
Well, actually,
he's in the hospital.

1079
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:58,612
Hospital?
My God.

1080
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,481
Oh, that poor kid.

1081
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:01,615
Can we go see him?

1082
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,750
Tomorrow.

1083
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,118
They said we should wait.

1084
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,354
I'll take you over.

1085
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,298
Are you gonna be alright?

1086
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,334
I don't know what to say.

1087
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:23,204
Well, just talk to him.

1088
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:27,508
He's still Paul, just talk.

1089
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,677
Talk like you always did.

1090
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,580
You'll be fine.

1091
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:33,847
Thanks, dad.

Hey.  You sleeping?

1094
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:51,432
Well, what do you want?

1095
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:55,035
It's me, Jimmy.

1096
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:57,938
Hey, man,
what happened to you?

1097
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,608
I almost didn't
recognize you.

1098
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,076
Decided to lose some weight.

1099
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,012
Sort of for survival.

1100
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:06,647
Yeah.

1101
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:10,017
I guess I lost
a little weight, too.

1102
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,587
I heard.

1103
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,455
I'm sorry.

1104
01:08:15,557 --> 01:08:17,891
I wish that didn't happen.

1105
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:21,262
Yeah, I wish a lot of things.

1106
01:08:24,966 --> 01:08:27,201
Do you want to see my leg?

1107
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,170
No.

1108
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,782
So, how's Sable?

1109
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,184
She's great.

1110
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:45,620
Oh, look at this.

1111
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:55,329
I knew it.

1112
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,864
See.

1113
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:00,168
I bet it was the councilor
who wrote us on MySpace.

1114
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,037
You'll be a great detective.

1115
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:05,573
Investigator Paul grove
here, ma'am.

1116
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:12,647
I'm sorry about my dad.

1117
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:18,919
I guess he just forgot
how to be a good person.

1118
01:09:23,124 --> 01:09:25,826
It's time for
therapy Paul.

1119
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:29,197
Good timing, huh?

1120
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:34,935
Glad you're back.

1121
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:40,274
Sable's a cutie, man.

1122
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:41,475
If you're not careful,

1123
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:45,279
Someone's gonna steal
her away from you.

1124
01:09:51,486 --> 01:09:54,222
See you later.

You should have seen

Jimmy?

1137
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,411
Okay, okay.

1138
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,813
I kissed Sable in school
in the cafeteria

1139
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,982
In front of everybody,
is that so bad?

1140

So, what did the
coach want?

1143
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:24,672
Oh, he was just talking to me
about how proud he was of me.

1144
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,042
And not everybody gets
a Chance to go to college

1145
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:31,078
And play football.

1146
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,391
Is it a scholarship?

1147
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:48,262
A full ride.

1148
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:50,931
I passed.

1149
01:12:52,734 --> 01:12:55,503
I'm going to college.

1150
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:00,040
Thank you.

1151
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,144
It wasn't just me.

1152

[sighs]

1153
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:16,791
Still want that ride
to the hospital?

1154
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,192
Yeah, that'd be great.

writing in a journal.</i>

losing weight.</i>

1175
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:18,118
<i>It was about
figuring out who I am.</i>

1176
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,421

how to figure that out myself.</i>

said that I was...

so new...

...Told me you were
over it and I...

01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,644
...Waiting for a moment to
come...
