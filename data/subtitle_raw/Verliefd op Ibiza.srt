1
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,920
When you fly?

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,911
Tomorrow morning.

3
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,073
But not without a farewell party, right?

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,590
You are very good.

5
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,999
I'm looking for someone who

6
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,039
can organize a birthday party for the girlfriend of a celebrity.

7
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,675
None. I get pimples with celebrities.

8
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,110
A football star. A really great guy.

9
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,833
Great guys there are everywhere.

10
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,119
Great, we're there!

11
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,714
Welcome ... - ... Ibiza!

12
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,831
Boyd, look. He is also there.

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,355
We are famous.

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,035
Das ist Armin van Buuren.

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,637
Hello mate, we are also DJs!

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,914
Come on, Lars, we give him a CD from us.

17
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,111
Hey, let's do that I will not end up in jail again.

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,754
This is our big chance. We need but only ...

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,637
Caution!

20
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,234
What do you have now bought again?

21
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,956
What? - Jasper is eight.

22
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,036
Shit.

23
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,914
Hey, there's our luggage.

24
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,032
Pim. The los, Nun mach schon.

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,837
Jasper.

26
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,317
Guys, hey guys come down from there, go, go, go, down. Hey.

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,310
Honey, do not be angry, but your collection is currently in Dubai.

28
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,797
Dubai? - Yes. Unfortunately I can not change.

29
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,957
Since when new trends develop in Dubai?

30
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,992
I have to call back later, and ... - New trends are developing on Ibiza.

31
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,474
Yeah, well, listen, honey, I ... - Toll.

32
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,677
I take care of it, I get the ready to go back.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,140
Do not worry, enjoy the time and do a few days of vacation.

34
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,231
I did not come here to vacation, Pim.

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,716
I'm here to promote my bikinis. Sorry!

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,480
Do you smell that, Irma?

37
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,473
Yes, it smells very strongly of kerosene.

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,069
Ich nur Riecho Testosteron, the Parfum von Ibiza.

39
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,192
How about us, honey? I pay in kind.

40
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,152
You could be his babysitter.

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,519
And if I were his grandmother, does not bother me.

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,831
We're here to have sex. - Oh yeah?

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,194
On my last sex I can barely remember, this was Scrabble.

44
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
Double word value. I have ten books here.

45
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,679
While you ausschläfst your noise,

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,440
I enjoy the beautiful beach weather with Dr. Zhivago.

47
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,872
Where we play our games Doctor, I do not care.

48
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,471
Na dann...

49
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,437
Real Madrid has paid all here?

50
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,751
Yes, that's really the nicest house we had until now.

51
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,032
Well, just this room here. Which is really terrible.

52
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,480
Why, what is it?

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,037
Here indeed fit not even clean my shoes.

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,152
Which must be true at least three times.

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,399
And Kevin agrees?

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,631
Dearest May, a single smile from me is enough.

57
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,192
Hello my sweet. - It's really not too big.

58
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,749
If you say so. Only the best for my best is good enough.

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,833
Only the walk-in closet is really too small.

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,077
Can we not make something bigger?

61
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,318
Klar, Süße. Hopa.

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,115
And what's in front of my strong Kevin on my birthday?

63
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,675
Oh, until now still nothing. - Nothing?

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,951
But I pay for it but this Mimique.

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,951
Na warte!

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,435
Lizzy, you can give me even a can of pineapple?

67
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,990
Fast Lizzy.

68
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,320
LOVING IBIZA - THE BIGGEST PARTY OF MY LIFE

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,072
Bibi, Schatz... - Hey.

70
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,513
You look really sexy. And so grown up.

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,910
I'm also grown. I'm 21

72
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,310
21?

73
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,470
And.

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,831
My birthday was two months ago? - Really?

75
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,712
You're not going to be like Dad, I hope, right?

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,920
Welcome to Grandpa, the party animals. - So, here we are.

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,432
Wow, I bet you, here there is also a swimming pool. Come on, this way.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,390
Dad, can I jump in like this, or do I have to wear a swimsuit?

79
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,472
Since no water is indeed there.

80
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,636
Und jetzt, Papa?

81
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,633
Hello dear. - Hello.

82
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,471
Hey.

83
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,396
Hey.

84
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,512
Hi. Oh...

85
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,960
You look stunning.

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,233
Oh, thank you. I have something for you. One for you and one for Liz.

87
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,634
One of your designs?

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,553
Of course. From the new collection.

89
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,911
Oh, cool. I find great.

90
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,959
Yes, fits well on it. The rest is now somewhere in the Sahara.

91
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,032
Zara! Sweety!

92
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,760
Hey! Guys, come to grandpa.

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,633
Bieb, you bring the glasses? - Yes.

94
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,833
Take your daddy's arms!

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,198
Slowly, Dad, I have a headache. My entire collection is now in. ..

96
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,791
Then we do it very carefully. Hello, sweetheart.

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,517
Hi Paps.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,510
Can I help you?

99
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,432
If you want. How are you then, Pim?

100
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:30,674
Well, getting to my ears. Two small children, an ambitious woman ...

101
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,198
You need a change of times, I think.

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,510
Ja, ja, das kann man sagen, ja.

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,549
Very well, then you're landing to the right place.

104
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,311
In Ibiza, anything is possible. I have here my innocence lost with 14.

105
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,600
Prost! Cheers!

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,719
Lecker, Opa.

107
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,395
Ah, that's the right spirit, huh?

108
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,871
What shall we give him for his birthday?

109
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,439
I bet you know what?

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,394
I've since seen on eBay a plate of Perry Como, from the year

111
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,796
in which he is born. That would be a nice gift.

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,357
I do not think Dad would like to be reminded of his birth year.

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,113
Yeah, so I'll have to agree with you already.

114
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,994
Okay. Yes. Do you have a better idea? Then out with it.

115
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,999
When it comes to it, we just do a few days of fun

116
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,713
and enjoy ourselves in Lizzy's club, very simple.

117
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
Liz, tell me, do you still have the store?

118
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,837
And.

119
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,670
Dear, you can be much more than that, how old are you now? Almost 30!

120
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,078
26, Zara!

121
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,789
Do you have a friend,

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,877
or are you hiding still with your colleagues in the broom closet?

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,310
Lizzy's colleagues are so hot, I would do the same.

124
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,157
And soon we'll get back a new charge.

125
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,590
Oh, stop it with these guys rancid. Is indeed disgusting.

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,031
And? How did you get to your fun? Pim does not look so

127
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,038
as it would be very often dragged into the broom closet.

128
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,156
Enough is enough.

129
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,711
Pim and I have a balanced sex life.

130
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,516
Oh, yeah? I can hardly imagine, if you always are wearing the pants.

131
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,394
Maybe you should not so often take off your pants, Liz.

132
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,399
Girls, I think it's wonderful.

133
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,836
We forget my birthday and romp with the waves.

134
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,553
Jasper! Pim, watch it sometimes on. Must I do everything myself?

135
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,199
What is it, Liz?

136
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,919
Zara's right, I'm getting too old.

137
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,834
Too old? What for?

138
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,949
For this constant running around in the bar for anything, really.

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,957
You take football to the most beautiful places and the best restaurants.

140
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,630
You always reservierst a VIP table and never ask what it costs. Easy.

141
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,238
But be careful. The girlfriends of footballers are annoying,

142
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,794
and they are always jealous.

143
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,914
Look at the camera.

144
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,469
In the camera.

145
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,315
Oh, my God.

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,552
Take off your shirt. Come on, get down with it. Pull out.

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,950
Pretty, is not it?

148
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,277
Terrible.

149
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,999
Can you make it wet?

150
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,277
Yes, this looks great. Great.

151
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,631
Gebt mir the Ball. The Ball.

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,674
But not with this stupid ball

153
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
Forget it, the ball remains. Comm

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,114
Oh Mann, gut so. Sexy, sexy.

155
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,200
Kevvie...

156
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,160
Oh yeah, that's good. Wow!

157
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll put you in front of him afterwards.

158
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,714
Hi. - Hi. - Kevin.

159
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,554
Lizzy... - Hoogland.

160
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,037
And.

161
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,914
Do you have experience?

162
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,270
Yes, yes, I ... I have been working together forever with musicians.

163
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,716
Well, they are somewhat difficult.

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,480
Just say what you want, and I'll organize it for you.

165
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,394
Tell me what you can offer.

166
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,436
The Gio is fully booked for months, but I can get you a VIP table.

167
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,398
Yes, Gio last week we were erst

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,074
Maybe a boat to Formentera? With DJ on board, loose feet in the sand ...

169
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,998
Beach is what wannabes.

170
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,237
So I do not know Kevvie can not organize someone your age that?

171
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,516
Sorry, aber...

172
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,035
Ah, her friend would really great find,

173
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,392
if they should do this for your friend.

174
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,150
N i ch t?

175
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,112
Yes. Yes, it is a really gigantic fan

176
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,869
Your girlfriend?

177
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,792
Yes. Yes, my girlfriend and I have been together a long time.

178
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,559
We are totally in love with each other.

179
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,433
And she is a fan of Kevin?

180
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,514
No, of you. She has voted dozens of times for you at X-Factor.

181
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,080
Do you hear that, Kevvie? - I hear that, honey.

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,953
Even lesbians are already fans of mine.

183
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,999
May I still call it that, right?

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,198
Of course. Out of me. Lesbian, Dyke, as you will.

185
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,277
My girlfriends and I have already made a list. I would ...

186
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,357
Yes, sweetie, but let all of the Mimique and ...

187
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,994
Minique ... - Lizzy.

188
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,515
Lizzy ... organize. They understand what it.

189
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,390
But I do have penguins on my birthday.

190
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,999
I can really laugh like that about them.

191
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,670
Well, if you want penguins, then you get even penguins, of course.

192
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,951
As you see it. Penguins, you can laugh about.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,351
Sorry.

194
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,510
Omi. Hi.

195
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,594
What? Already?

196
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,316
That was Grandma. It is almost in the harbor.

197
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,278
I have to go and pick them up.

198
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,115
That can not but now. The designers of our tattoos coming.

199
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,039
Fuck! This shit.

200
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,873
I can not pick up your grandma.

201
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,238
Yes. - Really? - Yes.

202
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,913
Your full serious? - Yes, of course.

203
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,190
That's sweet of you. - Oh, no problem.

204
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,633
I hang namely very attached to her.

205
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,915
And what's her name?

206
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,960
Karla Hoogland.

207
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,076
Hey, thank you.

208
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,035
Hey, you're welcome.

209
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,070
Hey, you're welcome.

210
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,356
"My heart goes boom". I'll see probably not right?

211
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,278
Please take your time. Do not you recognize me?

212
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,796
Jacky ...

213
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,956
Oh. Tag Lex.

214
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,398
How are you? - Prima. Just arrived. And you?

215
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,833
Still not grown up, I see.

216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,594
Opa ...

217
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,359
How time flies. Even for a pop singer. Day, Lex

218
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,397
Jacky.

219
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,430
Have fun.

220
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,114
You bet, Lex

221
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,279
Previously worked somehow better.

222
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,232
Oh how nice, a scarf.

223
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,909
Das ist ein and cycles.

224
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,792
If you keep it running around like an old maid,

225
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,513
I can abschminken evening the same success today.

226
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,630
But surely you do not believe that I ...

227
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,597
Wear!

228
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,153
So I prefer not to. Whether you like it or not.

229
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,590
In addition, because I do not fit inside. - What did you do?

230
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,750
The schau doch mal.

231
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,072
So I wear this dress again and that's that.

232
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,112
Hello. Now I look like a pregnant van Almsick.

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,314
But unfortunately without medal.

234
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,319
No, not even. - No.

235
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,320
It looks great. Come, now, we go hunting.

236
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,119
So I do not know. - Do not argue.

237
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,919
If you do not like tonight,

238
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,077
you can flirt on the beach again tomorrow with Dr. Zhivago.

239
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,072
Yes, but now imagine it out before that ..

240
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,310
Was?

241
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,398
Imagine someone of the opposite sex suddenly has interest in you.

242
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,390
Well. Yes. Then you gotta run in your life.

243
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,070
Also...

244
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,637
Zara?

245
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,395
Hey, honey, I've been thinking what.

246
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,712
When we returned the bikinis and the photo shoot is over, then

247
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,991
we could go camping for a few days.

248
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,314
Comfortable for four. Under the stars fall asleep and wake up on the beach.

249
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,712
Maybe we can even sleep together again.

250
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,955
A long time ago. After that we no longer know how to do it.

251
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,719
Pim ... - And?

252
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,438
I have the most important photo-reportage of my career ahead of me,

253
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,392
and all the bikinis are simply gone!

254
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,796
I try now anyway with all this stress to cope.

255
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,400
So if you do not mind ...

256
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,039
Yes, but if the bikinis now are not there,

257
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,554
The magazine takes you next month too.

258
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,117
Then they already make their Autumn Special.

259
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,276
Then just next year.

260
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,759
A designer of 29 may still be hot and interesting.

261
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,440
But a 34 is something out of!

262
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,996
Honey, you're 31 You can always ...

263
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,670
Zara.

264
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,720
Then do whatever you want.

265
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,995
Ich bin Karla.

266
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,679
Welcome to Ibiza, Karla.

267
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,032
You've gained a lot. On television, you were much slimmer.

268
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,996
Oh no, no, no, I'm not Elza. I'm Lizzy, the party planner.

269
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,430
I organize Elza's birthday party.

270
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,318
That because they can not organize themselves?

271
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,790
Ah, for me ...

272
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,280
Oh, I'll take the here.

273
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,352
Ah, the bikinis, I'll tell you, eventually they'll kill me.

274
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,591
Such a fuss because a small piece of cloth.

275
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,113
And you ..

276
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,151
Still not old enough for a boyfriend?

277
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,995
No. The guys at my age're all still so very childish.

278
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,030
Do you understand that?

279
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,475
Yes, I can understand that very well. When I was as old as you,

280
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,712
I was even too cowardly to a girl we talk to you.

281
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,592
But that was a long time ago, Pim.

282
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,352
And.

283
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,636
I have the feeling that you really understand me.

284
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,997
Na and ...

285
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,718
I always feel so alone.

286
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,116
Hey. This is us all sometimes, right?

287
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,396
Wow!

288
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,036
What is it?

289
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,952
Grandpa has a real drum.

290
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,714
Oh my goodness, here it looks so chic it than for "Bold and the Beautiful".

291
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,316
Omi! Glad you're here.

292
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,996
Elza!

293
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,795
So this is Elza. You know her from X Factor, but this is real here.

294
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,274
Schwiegeroma. Omi. What should I call you?

295
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,439
Karla wäre gut.

296
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,512
Omi. I'm glad you're here.

297
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,795
How do you like it?

298
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,950
Really nice, is not it? I am.

299
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,911
And when it's done, can Kevvie it tattooed on the back.

300
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,877
But it did not fit after all.

301
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,834
Smaller, of course.

302
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,879
In the kitchen there are more pictures of me. Want to see them?

303
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,439
Because they eat enough?

304
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,358
Lasst reden Mich., okay? - Okay.

305
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,954
Hey We are looking for the manager of this shop here.

306
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm the manager.

307
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,556
Okay,

308
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,595
I'm Lars and the two DJs, and Dylan Boyd,

309
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,394
and we have something here, I'll tell you something you've never heard of.

310
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,271
Music?

311
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,553
Yes. - And you want to hang up?

312
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,791
Wow. Do you hear that it is capable of.

313
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,718
We are powered. Good luck yet.

314
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,717
Hey, warte.

315
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,476
Vergiss Club... - Progessive... Electro... - Deep House...

316
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,239
Clubhouse... - Acid house... - Eurohouse... - Techno...

317
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,232
Drum and Base. This is different.

318
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,391
Listen, we've Ibiza House, we do not need your music too.

319
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,319
So this is Ibiza House?

320
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,709
What a smooth, prehistoric shit, hey, cemetery crash.

321
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,399
Get the snorer about all that?

322
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,997
Yes. But we will change that. Come friends, keep the spirit.

323
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,591
Do you know that I used to not even like fish?

324
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,878
And now I love fish. Especially tuna I find delicious.

325
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,680
By the way, nice here. Quiet.

326
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,396
What is it?

327
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,915
Nothing. Too little drunk.

328
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,399
Next time we go to Paris, right?

329
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,875
And how is it with bikinis?

330
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,080
Oh, Dad, that are truly gone by the earth.

331
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,073
But nice that you ask for it. - You know that "bikini" is an island?

332
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,597
And maybe they are back there. Yes, exactly. Back to the roots!

333
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,711
Pop. So I do not believe now, right? Did you about ... Hey!

334
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,318
Have you already taken about that stuff?

335
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,796
No, I have only taken a small pill cocktail.

336
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,957
I feel more than okay.

337
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,551
Okay.

338
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,950
Congratulations.

339
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,670
Ah, that's the day after tomorrow, but still ever thank you, my boy.

340
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
My wild tigress.

341
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,719
Oh guys, I love you all.

342
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,039
You are a true free spirit, I like that about you, you know? Base age.

343
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,236
Hi there.

344
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
Can I have a little champagne?

345
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,314
No chance, darling, no way.

346
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,152
We take two Coca Cola for the children.

347
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,953
You know that they are nervous about it.

348
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,231
But not as nervous as you, honey.

349
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,071
Cheers!

350
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,197
And.

351
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,559
The two flirt. - What?

352
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,711
Not too young, not too old, just right.

353
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,630
He looks at her?

354
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,553
No. Jumped.

355
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,115
He looks anyway.

356
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,790
Now he looks back.

357
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,594
If he finds me sexy?

358
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,716
Put it fixed. You surely have enough experience. Anyway more than I do.

359
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,029
Is kommt. Is kommt here, kommt here.

360
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,190
Hi ladies. How's it going?

361
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,511
Hi.

362
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,039
Prima. And you?

363
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,395
You two holidays here, yes?

364
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,915
Yes, that too. We are from Holland. And you?

365
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,638
I grew up here. But my parents come from Brussels.

366
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,190
My name is Steve.

367
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,832
Steve? I got my first kiss from a Steve. I Love Belgium.

368
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,394
Since the south begins, I always say.

369
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,915
Oh. The South begins to something deeper with you.

370
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,633
Your first day here? - Yes.

371
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,473
Then I beat before, we show you the clubs.

372
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,596
Das War and customs.

373
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,791
We take a taxi and a VIP table.

374
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,230
It looks delicious.

375
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,277
Good appetite.

376
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,072
Thank you.

377
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,909
How beautiful.

378
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,120
My daughters.

379
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,236
Pim ...

380
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,078
And the rockers, Jesper and Sam.

381
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,356
Jasper and Sem

382
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,915
Yes, I say yes. Jasper and Sem

383
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,320
I've missed you.

384
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,114
Little noticed. I thought you like it great on the island.

385
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,072
But it's true, Zara.

386
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,071
Now, just as before.

387
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,079
As I've wasted my time trying to make music ...

388
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,600
And rumzuvögeln.

389
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,631
To tour ... ...

390
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,154
With ... more women than there were condoms ...

391
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,515
Yes, and for what?

392
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,156
What do you want, you were even second in the charts of ...

393
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,760
Von Japan. - Japan and.

394
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,319
Yes, yes, you're laughing times. You're right. As a father, I have failed miserably.

395
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,820
And also as a husband.

396
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,752
We prefer not to talk about our mothers.

397
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,473
Yes, we can leave it out please?

398
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,640
I see them still. Your three mothers.

399
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,556
They stare at me. And suddenly she directed a gun at me.

400
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,597
Hey, hey, Lex...

401
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,431
And I say, "Shoot it!" Because they are right.

402
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,719
I'm a selfish, fucking ass Losch.

403
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,756
Guys ...

404
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,940
Grandpa is drunk.

405
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,156
Come on, guys, let's go. Ow! - You all stay here.

406
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,000
What is to become of it?

407
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,310
Come!

408
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,910
Out of me. - All three.

409
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,950
Dad, I'm working here on the island, remember.

410
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,029
I love you.

411
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,553
Dad, I can see your cleavage.

412
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,869
My fault.

413
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,793
Forgive me, please. - All is forgiven, Lex

414
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,349
Bieb? - When the Pap.

415
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,756
Und Zara, the auch?

416
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,718
Yes, all right. Now get up again and please behave yourself normal. Yes ...

417
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,873
I love you all. My sirens.

418
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,470
Starting today, I'll be a good father and grandfather.

419
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,559
This guy gets a makeover!

420
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,556
Raise your glasses.

421
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,798
Let us celebrate life!

422
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,357
Paps!

423
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,959
El, look how expensive this ring.

424
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,236
That does not matter. Once loving smile will suffice.

425
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,720
1.400.

426
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,272
He is determined to never say yes.

427
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,636
Aber er sagt doch immer: "Don't settle for anything less."

428
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,832
Does not something like: "The bigger, the better"?

429
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,280
He wants you to get the best ...

430
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,516
Omi, alles gut?

431
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,797
And.

432
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,640
You are not cleans surely?

433
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,836
Why not you?

434
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,510
Oh, Omi. You have here, but do not clean.

435
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,513
That her is well determined.

436
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,757
It has a name. It is Elza.

437
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,955
How do you find them?

438
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,074
Elza you mean? That is your decision.

439
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,996
I'll stop on her birthday for her hand.

440
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,197
What would have thought your father of Elza, what do you think?

441
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,476
Do you doubt?

442
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,472
To you two? No. But has Elza, except this X Factor,

443
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,517
still learned a real job?

444
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,320
I'm still not.

445
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,834
I've also just asked.

446
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,269
Tasse Tee?

447
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,670
Hello, here I am again. Sorry.

448
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,595
Hi. I just wanted to ask,

449
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,474
whether the reservation for tonight's okay.

450
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,031
Thank you.

451
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,550
Sorry. Do you like Ibiza?

452
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,869
Until now, very good.

453
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,999
Kevin! Kevin, can I ask you something?

454
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,440
No, please not now. - Yes, but ...

455
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,880
You married?

456
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,473
Baby, come on. - Kevin, can I have your autograph?

457
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,590
Get out.

458
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,877
Baby.

459
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,220
Hello, I am a big fan .. - Would you like an autograph?

460
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,560
Yeah, sure. - Turn around.

461
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,633
Regelst you? - Of course.

462
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,792
Comes.

463
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,715
Lizzy. I'm sorry, that we trouble you again,

464
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,911
but we have to go in there. - We do not deal drugs.

465
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,798
We do not smoke. - We do not drink.

466
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,794
What do you want there? So good. It's okay.

467
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,950
Du bist classes!

468
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,594
I've also started times.

469
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,238
These drinks are included, right?

470
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,551
Besides the Campagner, 1,000 euros a bottle.

471
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,917
Lars, that's ... this is ...

472
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,119
The sky!

473
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,114
The drinks for 43

474
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,390
This is us.

475
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,195
Champagne.

476
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,471
Welcome to Ibiza. - Thanks.

477
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,673
Hi. - Come on. - You're welcome.

478
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,429
Hey, man, get out, get out.

479
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,358
This is new music, I have to give it to him.

480
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,436
We come again tomorrow before the club opens.

481
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,353
Lars, now we are here ...

482
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,874
But that is never what.

483
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,276
Good. If you can do better ...

484
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,271
And.

485
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,591
Good. Then it does make it yourself good luck.

486
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,437
Okay.

487
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,834
Guys, come, man

488
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,839
What, 17 euros, so much? My goodness.

489
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,678
For that I can buy a whole iceberg at the North Pole, yes, if I want.

490
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,231
Since you get the free. - Please?

491
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,154
That is so expensive because the guys take pills. Then they deserve something.

492
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,671
But they are well informed. Thank God I'm too old.

493
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,591
Hey...

494
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,475
40 is the new 30 I guess you are not older than 37

495
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,116
Yes, thank you. That's nice, but you're so easy to see through.

496
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,390
Who is it?

497
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,710
Well, your generation.

498
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,560
And that bothers you, right?

499
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,870
No. No, no you're right. That's kind of great.

500
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,759
I'd not trust it. Sorry.

501
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,074
Oh, I am the way, Lars.

502
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,590
Irma.

503
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,838
And in case you think I'm only 26, I'm 27

504
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,235
Oh. Gott sei Dank.

505
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,840
Hey Leute, Belly Shot.

506
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,835
Say, we do not prefer to go to the lounge? Since it is much quieter.

507
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,913
Do not worry, nothing can happen in there, because depends a condom machine.

508
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,235
Ah, na dann...

509
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,991
And you're alone? Lars von already legendary 27

510
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,551
No, I'm here with two friends, Dylan and Boyd.

511
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,959
You are looking for a club where they can hang up.

512
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,391
So wie Tiesto, David Guetta, Armin van Buuren ...

513
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,472
You have no idea what I'm talking about at all.

514
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,951
No. No, "hang up" since the word I did not come already with.

515
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,676
What drives you here?

516
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,156
Oh, I guess that would be too boring for you.

517
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,996
I'm a suitcase full of books here.

518
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,110
No, leave that!

519
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,469
Oh, sorry.

520
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,436
I just wanted to order something stronger.

521
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,557
I thought you wanted to do something in my glass.

522
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,155
Wait, wait. Here.

523
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,156
What's this?

524
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,237
Sorry.

525
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,590
But absorbs well.

526
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,710
My God.

527
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,158
Oh thank you. - Please.

528
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,200
She loves to be the center.

529
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,233
Yes, but she also loves you.

530
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,239
Where do you want to know as precisely?

531
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,879
You never know for sure.

532
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,711
Even if you're not famous, you can not be sure.

533
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,189
Tja, da hast du recht.

534
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,160
You know, I would never want to be famous.

535
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,838
I would like to know the X Factor,

536
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,397
but then only on Saturday night 11 to 1

537
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,592
And then everything will be normal again.

538
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,475
With you it's never normal, right? But maybe you do not want that,

539
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,193
otherwise you would not do on Ibiza holiday.

540
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,757
Then you would be flown safely to a desert island.

541
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,634
That did not Elza. You have something already like.

542
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,997
I was hoping that I still meet you here.

543
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,789
A Pillchen?

544
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,070
Drinking.

545
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,950
That was a mistake, right? - No, that's good.

546
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,910
Oh dear.

547
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,279
Show me your request. Well come on, the application.

548
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,154
Okay. So I'll go first to his knees in front of her ...

549
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:48,878
And.

550
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,280
Armin makes appropriate music ... ... - Yes?

551
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,998
And then ... I see her in the eye and give her a hand. And then I say ...

552
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,635
Come on, you Elza richest hand, so I?

553
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,078
Okay, okay, pass auf.

554
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,680
Imagine that you marry your girlfriend.

555
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,513
It's now allowed, but you are allowed to marry.

556
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,829
Kevin! Hey...

557
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,758
Hey, hey, I'm not a lesbian.

558
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,836
Hi. - What is?

559
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,872
And I have no girlfriend, you know?

560
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,673
I had to say just before Minique.

561
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,838
Oh crap, now I've told it, and can not say it.

562
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,916
Sorry, was?

563
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,514
I'm not a lesbian!

564
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,192
I'll see it does not look like a lesbian.

565
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,071
You did not really think, I'd be a lesbian, right?

566
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,399
Hey, yet! So you've really kept me for a lesbian, right?

567
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,795
So then I really seh as if I were a lesbian?

568
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,834
Voila! - So!

569
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,557
Cheers!

570
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,713
Sun's what I call a real club duo!

571
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,954
I hope it is not a hobby of yours,

572
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,958
The nose to hit men on the first date bloody.

573
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,111
No, really, no, no, you were the first.

574
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,711
Beautiful language, is not it? - Yes, beautiful.

575
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,151
My shoulder is canceled. - No. - Yes.

576
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,800
This is not serious. Come on.

577
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:42,515
If I ... I mean just imagine, I think sometime really my dream man,

578
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,633
I would my marriage proposal

579
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,753
would like to get to a beautiful, secluded spot.

580
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,069
And there is here?

581
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,870
Auf Ibiza? Ja.

582
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,997
Comm

583
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,075
I can not.

584
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,079
Wait, wait times.

585
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,393
I need to rest for a while now myself. - Yeah, not so easy, huh?

586
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,914
What are you doing?

587
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,234
What's this? 50 cents.

588
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,714
Das ist if Irre.

589
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,440
For this, we buy an ice cream.

590
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,715
Ja, Gute Idee.

591
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,999
Shit. Sorry.

592
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,511
Now I have to go quite quickly once where.

593
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,910
Yes, I already understood. As is the bathroom.

594
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,553
Hey, hey, hey.

595
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,030
Hey.

596
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,711
Hey.

597
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,796
Hey Bieb.

598
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,599
Bibi! What are you doing here? Why ...

599
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,160
I've been here the whole time.

600
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,836
How? But I do not understand. Who is it now with the children?

601
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,751
Lex Lex she took as part of his new grandpa Makeovers.

602
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,552
Lex?

603
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,120
That's handy. What is there already happen?

604
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,877
What? What's supposed to happen?

605
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,432
Fuck. Shit, damn.

606
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,437
Zara. Shit.

607
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,195
Hey, guys, are you still awake?

608
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,671
Hey?

609
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,276
Fuck!

610
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,996
Wow.

611
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,750
Beautiful, is not it?

612
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,476
Yes, beautiful.

613
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,836
Probably it would be something too quiet for Elza.

614
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,834
Yes, for sure Elza, yes.

615
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,194
Nostradamus has said that in a doomsday

616
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,118
Ibiza is the last refuge on earth.

617
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,319
Since he has chosen well, this Nostratus.

618
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,557
When the world comes, I want to be here at this place.

619
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,037
No, you can not. Now it is my place.

620
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,431
No, because I have shown you the place.

621
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,271
No, you have only taken me here, so it belongs to me now.

622
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,556
You just try to take away my place?

623
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,956
Do we share?

624
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,910
Good.

625
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,194
"Thank you, ma'am"

626
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,715
Your bill.

627
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,838
1,800 euros? Damn, shit-Belgians.

628
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,240
Plus tip.

629
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,514
Tip? Here you have your tip.

630
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,109
And now pulling leash.

631
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,955
Pim, stop.

632
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,480
Pim, what is this?

633
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,310
Pim, stop it!

634
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,116
His car is not there.

635
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,989
Lass the Pim.

636
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,197
Jasper?

637
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,713
Jasper? Which?

638
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,553
Pim! They're gone!

639
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,235
The beach is back there!

640
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,070
Are you okay?

641
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,350
What do you think?

642
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,796
Jacky.

643
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,237
Yes. Jacky again.

644
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,757
Do you have a flat tire?

645
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,752
No, I enjoy watching the sunrise here.

646
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,240
I'd enjoy it with you,

647
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,317
but my grandchildren have made with the quad out of the dust.

648
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,159
Search for your grandchildren, you quietly.

649
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,671
And order your much too young woman greetings.

650
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,270
I'm not a young woman.

651
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,393
Oh, Lex, stop it. I've seen you but yesterday.

652
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,676
That was my daughter.

653
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,317
Fuck!

654
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,439
Dad, wo sind the Children?

655
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,316
The guys are just ... currently go with the quad.

656
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,114
On the quad, Lex? How can you allow that?

657
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,072
Take just a little bit, just a bit, no problem.

658
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,557
As they pass on. Hey guys! Yes, they have a lot of fun.

659
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,957
Dear, I must stop. I have the boys. Yes? Bye bye.

660
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,560
Lex, I want you to come back here right now.

661
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,558
Yeah, okay, okay, honey, I'll see you later at home.

662
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,875
And they are at it?

663
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,957
He's lying.

664
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,874
Fuck! Fuck!

665
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,799
What's going on? - What?

666
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,597
Be glad that you have never married me.

667
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,679
As a husband I had not even made the second place in Japan.

668
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,119
I have to look for the boys. Where you have to go?

669
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,994
Hey! These are my nephews.

670
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,676
Hold on.

671
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,711
Hey!

672
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,473
Sem! Jasper!

673
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,831
Hold it! Hold on!

674
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,149
No, we want the beach!

675
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,959
Los, gib Gas! - Okay!

676
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,476
Shit.

677
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,800
Guys! Hey guys, if you remain standing, we play a game of football.

678
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,280
Das ist Kevin Highlands. - Yes.

679
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,675
But then you have to stop, okay?

680
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,236
Okay. Word of honor?

681
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,869
Yes, I promise, I promise!

682
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,275
So okay, we stop.

683
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,717
Attack.

684
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,311
And!

685
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,431
Wow.

686
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,870
You do not need any more.

687
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,797
Get in the car.

688
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,478
And!

689
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,477
Goal!

690
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,192
Dad, we played football on the beach with Kevin Hoogland.

691
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,555
Hey, dear ones.

692
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,155
That's really true. - Was Lionel Messi, too?

693
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,630
No, but we played on the beach and he stayed much longer,

694
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,989
than I thought. - Thank you, Lizzy.

695
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,840
Is that really true? - Yes.

696
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,792
Since you have had really good luck. - Yes.

697
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,075
So, guys, but now we go to bed.

698
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,313
Do you also have penalties practiced with him?

699
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,319
They are the favorite children of the world.

700
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,197
And.

701
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,356
Oh. I must have fallen asleep, what?

702
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,875
I've noticed, Snow White.

703
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,519
I wanted to kiss you awake already, because,

704
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,716
maybe tomorrow you're already a surfboard.

705
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,069
Yes. - Here.

706
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,070
I'm worried for you.

707
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,152
Do you know what I find so great about you?

708
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,197
No.

709
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,957
I expected what else, when I saw you.

710
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,398
And what you did not expect, in particular?

711
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,074
Romance.

712
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,559
I mean, a man who worried a dress for you,

713
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,755
in a hotel full of cockroaches and a dirty bathtub ...

714
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,829
A woman can be seen ... Yes, enormous longing, you know?

715
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,030
Say, we do not want but rather go to my apartment?

716
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,675
Yes, a good idea.

717
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,833
And? What do you think?

718
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,355
Cheesy.

719
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,156
You are right. I am a single cliché.

720
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,951
But I was already second time in Japan.

721
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,077
Ah yes, "My heart goes boom." That was a pretty lousy number.

722
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,996
Abolut.

723
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,714
The Japanese are deaf.

724
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,191
And you?

725
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,560
Married, no children, and when he is blown,

726
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,831
I've asked myself what I've actually done all the time?

727
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,316
You still look as good as then, Jacky.

728
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,320
Good God, what we used to but fucked horny. As the hamster.

729
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,951
Hey!

730
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,959
But we had fantastic sex, right?

731
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,874
Lex Be honest. Did you at that time what that means? I?

732
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,752
So honestly, no.

733
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,000
At that time I was busy with my little friend.

734
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,909
And I really had a lot to do.

735
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,435
Anyway, you're honest.

736
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,156
Only later I realized that you were something special.

737
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,237
But it was too late.

738
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,677
Hi.

739
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,637
Hi!

740
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,510
Hi.

741
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,831
How was it?

742
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,751
Super! I've just lost the other.

743
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,878
I then took a taxi. At your expense.

744
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,719
Yes, that's my youngest, Bibi.

745
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,435
How old is Bibi?

746
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,878
21, And, 21

747
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,956
I want to go home.

748
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,277
Was?

749
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,995
I want to go home.

750
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,830
Thank you.

751
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,030
We see each other again?

752
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,677
It's my birthday tomorrow. I celebrate today purely night,

753
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,879
in "Buffaage." I would be delighted if you would come.

754
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,356
We'll see.

755
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,153
Come here! I'll throw you in the pool.

756
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,230
No, you're not real. Caution, my champagne! Put me down!

757
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,390
Hi.

758
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,194
Hi. I am.

759
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,236
And.

760
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,953
I found this place very beautiful.

761
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,117
Yes. Beautifully.

762
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,469
I think you're great.

763
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,636
Oh...

764
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,430
Okay...

765
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,996
So now you'd have to actually say that you also found me great find.

766
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,798
Yes. - Or not?

767
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,238
Yes, actually, already, I think. Oh, sorry, I ...

768
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,876
When it comes to VIPs, I am somehow not as good.

769
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,874
But that was also on past that. If my father's birthday,

770
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,516
were many famous people there, and then I was taken out of my bed

771
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,836
and had to sing a song, though I can not sing.

772
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,230
That was really embarrassing, you know?

773
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,674
You're doing it again.

774
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,991
Was?

775
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,632
Well, you always give full throttle.

776
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,310
Sorry.

777
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,595
No, do not stop.

778
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,110
Look at me just once as Kevin.

779
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:54,354
Good. You know, actually I know all about not really you.

780
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,874
It does not really matter whether you're famous.

781
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,556
I mean ... I mean, you've got a friend who you will marry.

782
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,156
And so I'm not a girl, you know?

783
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,718
It was still great, Kevin. Bye.

784
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,274
No. Lizzy, wait, I ...

785
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,878
Who was that so early?

786
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,872
I'm going to fall in love. Add a footballer.

787
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,834
Well, that definitely fits to Ibiza.

788
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,271
Yes Yes

789
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,636
Black?

790
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,154
But all ...

791
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,469
Penguins.

792
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,234
Oh Zara.

793
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,993
Oh Bibi, du bist das.

794
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,954
Holy shit. This is no longer true.

795
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,319
Hey, hallo!

796
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,916
Bibi ... Bibi ... Bi .. Sorry. This is no longer true.

797
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,714
Since tonight I am again totally at Zara.

798
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,156
Bastard!

799
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,314
Pim? Oh ... - And?

800
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,911
Can you please take the children afterwards? When they are awake?

801
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,956
Is good.

802
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,839
Allow you, monsieur?

803
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,997
Hello. I am a green Seehulk.

804
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,278
I try to catch my mermaid.

805
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,635
But that probably will not interest you. You want to sleep better now.

806
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,955
I pull at me quickly and then I'm gone.

807
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,871
Ha ha, I have another one! Here, this is the vengeance of Neptune.

808
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,956
Dr. Zhivago probably had no office, right?

809
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,190
You're pretty hypocritical, I think. How old is that?

810
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,832
Much older than you might think. And also much more mature.

811
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,715
This does not work anyway.

812
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,879
Oh. Why is that? You must have only dim the light.

813
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,433
You're a real bitch.

814
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,111
The lesbian took just a boat to organize,

815
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,312
but even this she is too stupid. Where is she anyway?

816
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,714
Sleep? Sweet, it's just gone wrong ...

817
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,872
Kevvie, I want a speed boat.

818
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,555
And on the speed boat to be made then of course photos.

819
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,957
And these photos then I will tweet. After all, there are thousands of people,

820
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,675
really want to know what I do all day long, so everything.

821
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,632
Yes, but hardly what you are doing.

822
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,358
Actually, you're doing nothing at all.

823
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,436
Kev...

824
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,880
Women, women ...

825
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,077
You suck it all day long only to these stems.

826
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,793
A stem at a time.

827
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,874
Hello, it's me, Lizzy.

828
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,070
Good morning.

829
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,917
Hi. - Hi.

830
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,114
You could have a try to do something other than constantly just to tweet pictures.

831
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,835
You could for example go to the beach and read a book.

832
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,072
Read a book? The real but no one believes me.

833
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,913
No, you're right.

834
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,191
I only read somewhere when something is written about me.

835
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,231
That's the great thing about my life. I do not need to lie on Twitter.

836
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,239
For me, everything is just real. And everyone is jealous of me.

837
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,754
You understand that?

838
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,119
Yes, Elza. I understand more than you think.

839
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,476
We get a new boat. - And how big?

840
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,118
This is an ice sculpture of Kevin and Elza.

841
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,432
Oh, what a frosty affair. But very apt.

842
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,039
Senoritas! The black pigs.

843
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,800
The penguins.

844
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,395
The Penguins ...

845
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,957
Fuck.

846
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,594
Piglets. How sweet.

847
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,958
I want my penguins!

848
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,553
You should now prefer to make no more mistakes. Lesbian!

849
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,675
Well done to el. You're so unprofessional.

850
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,309
Sorry, I ...

851
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,274
May I join you today?

852
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,160
But you can spend on a two-million-speed boat the day.

853
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,031
"Armin van Buurens Sommerhaus fertig"

854
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,916
Hey! Let das. buy yourself one.

855
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,396
He is at home.

856
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,958
Hey Armin, we have a ... Oh, wait, Armin, ... Here, we have a CD for you.

857
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,157
We want to present you with. - Yes, we are DJs.

858
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,839
And we got here ... - Dylan Boyd.

859
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,115
Because ... we wanted to ask you ...

860
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,838
Come into the water, because we are only sure.

861
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,235
Swimming!

862
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,191
What's this? - A smartphone.

863
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,600
Ah! - I am.

864
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,911
Can you ever check if the prepaid is otherwise too expensive.

865
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,951
And.

866
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:30,079
80,000? This must surely be pesetas then, right?

867
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,034
No, those are euros.

868
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,954
Here it is. The ring I have designed specifically for your wedding.

869
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,917
Okay.

870
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,230
Wow.

871
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,235
Put it on time.

872
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,833
I would like to see what that looks like.

873
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,239
Really beautiful.

874
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,560
It is not for me ...

875
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,720
I have to call, penguins and such.

876
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,519
Kevin, Kevin, you look at the ring. There is so much personality in it.

877
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,000
It is specially designed for you.

878
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,076
How are you?

879
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,271
Before.

880
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,078
Would you rather to the beach? - No.

881
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,998
Or would you rather go home? - No.

882
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,830
What do you want then?

883
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,952
I would love to beat you mercilessly now.

884
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,112
Zara, Zara, Bitte, ich ...

885
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,760
I'm happy that you're back with me.

886
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,832
And you amuse yourself with my sister!

887
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,356
Half-sister.

888
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,434
Zara. I beg you.

889
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,193
Dad, it's boring here.

890
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,760
Here, you buy an ice cream, right?

891
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,233
That is 50 euros. Yes!

892
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,834
Not very clever to begin in the middle of the market with it.

893
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,195
But you're clever, yes?

894
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,193
Hey, when we arrived here, has been running our marriage sucks.

895
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,079
So you thought to yourself: "You know what, I'll do once a makeover."

896
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,998
Yes. No, I ... - Yes!

897
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,110
No, I, I ... It was wrong of course, but I feel so much better now.

898
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,433
But only because I now know again how much I still love you.

899
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,557
Hey...

900
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,760
Hey, worth doch mal.

901
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,755
Pim, I have to find my collection.

902
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,472
And when I'm back at Lex, you're gone, right?

903
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,036
Was?

904
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,312
And you take Jasper and also with Sem.

905
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,673
Dad, where are we going?

906
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,958
I do not know, guys. We just need to look for something new short times.

907
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,120
Maybe a campground or something.

908
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,759
No, but I will not! I find camping stupid.

909
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,435
Now keep it out finally your mouth, you hear!

910
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,798
Your whole life I have provided for you,

911
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,793
such as if you are in the ICU. Now you accepted me,

912
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,872
what I say, without nagging again, is that clear?

913
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,670
Was? Here?

914
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,796
Ah, very good. Bit boring. I read a lot on the beach.

915
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,517
Hey, how's your exam go?

916
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,957
Oh, very good, fine.

917
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,871
Okay, darling, yes, good. Bye.

918
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,839
It was still raining in the Netherlands.

919
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,794
Is this something serious with you and Lars? - No, of course not.

920
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,270
Why not you? - Well, Classify ..

921
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,599
Because you're scared, right?

922
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,592
Jacky, stop it. You know how old I am.

923
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,160
So far I can not count.

924
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,233
I just think people should behave well according to their age.

925
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,880
But is very trendy, MILF be. - What?

926
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,960
MILF. A mother I'd like to fuck.

927
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,711
Hey!

928
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,070
What will you do?

929
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,392
With just some things you need to accomplish. For example, therewith to be young.

930
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,159
Can I have it then?

931
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,353
For the most beautiful woman on the island.

932
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,478
Lars, stop, do not be an idiot. I could be your mother.

933
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,597
I found it very nice last night, really. Maybe too good.

934
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,596
You know .. I'm just not used to it.

935
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,511
And if I'm getting used to it again and it stops again,

936
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,233
I miss it.

937
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,192
And then I must himself around me again.

938
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,034
I do not know if I can do it. And wants.

939
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,076
Do you understand?

940
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,673
Of course not. You are ...

941
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,074
I'm old enough.

942
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,799
In any case, I was not born yesterday.

943
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,510
So here they take. I'm not vain picked.

944
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,474
I'm crazy. Oh ...

945
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,789
Lovingly crazy.

946
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,115
Not an eggnog. At home, you get to every street corner.

947
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,669
An eggnog for the lady? Is done immediately.

948
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,353
Are you doing to yourself? - Yes.

949
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,920
Ah, that's sweet of you.

950
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,511
It languishes then, since it is here.

951
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,792
But it is my job to meet you your dreams.

952
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,431
No, better not. - Once tapas!

953
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,917
Okay, I will. - No.

954
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,394
My father used to have a snack bar.

955
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,630
Has he sold?

956
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,319
Yes. And that he regretted the rest of his life. He died when I was 14.

957
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,119
He has never seen you play?

958
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:24,872
Yet. Until I was twelve. He was my biggest fan Then he got sick.

959
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,716
And you?

960
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,833
He lives here in Ibiza. Together with my half sister

961
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,119
and twelve very old, gold records.

962
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,631
Please, Lizzy, a kiss.

963
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,795
One only.

964
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,516
There have been ordered 1,000 bottles of champagne,

965
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,156
and in the end even someone sees us here. It really is not, Kevin.

966
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,159
Since the delivery of Amsterdam.

967
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:28,560
The? No, Seniors! A rather large box. Senior!

968
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,753
Your plate. Here.

969
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,553
Senior Verbeek? Senior Verbeek? Aus Dubai.

970
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,279
We apologize for the mistake.

971
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,551
Thank you.

972
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,760
Dad, what is it?

973
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,636
It's nothing.

974
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,273
Seid ihr und Dylan Boyd?

975
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,594
Das ist Armin van Buuren.

976
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,359
And you heard this CD here.

977
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,310
I want to hear how they sound in a large room times.

978
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,400
Cheers!

979
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,840
My Twitter!

980
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,193
Hey Jacky.

981
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,034
Wow, Armin. Das war so...

982
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,233
How did you like it?

983
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,155
Herr van Buuren?

984
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,791
Hey.

985
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,790
I guess this will be a pretty awesome show,

986
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,112
with you as support.

987
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,476
Here?

988
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,236
Tonight.

989
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,038
I do not believe it. - Real madness.

990
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,153
All ... doors open. I always thought it was totally great on this island.

991
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,674
So you still mix with?

992
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,996
You know, this island is, it is chilling rough.

993
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:29,951
Age is completely irrelevant.

994
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,514
Yes, but I see in the photos too often girls

995
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,553
who are even younger than your oldest daughter.

996
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,517
Na and ...

997
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,040
Then take them home with you.

998
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,994
And there they have to admire your collection of gold records?

999
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,799
Who make so well to the wall.

1000
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,115
And? Are they impressed?

1001
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,720
God, what a small child.

1002
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,796
Jacky?

1003
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,036
Jacky!

1004
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,235
Hi. - Hi.

1005
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,754
Excuse me, I am looking for Jacky.

1006
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,754
Hey, I know you yet.

1007
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,276
"My heart goes boom, boom", ja.

1008
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,240
Great kindness, Jacky's right, you look like a wax figure at Madame Tussaud's.

1009
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,592
Jacky is at the small beach there.

1010
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,036
Hey.

1011
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,154
Beware that you do not melt.

1012
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,872
Hi. Have you already that before?

1013
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,314
No. I have no plans.

1014
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,036
Are you coming? I have to stand up in front me there.

1015
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:05,955
I think I'll lie down. The eggnog is me probably gone to his head.

1016
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,880
I think I would have been better but will not make a full liter.

1017
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,596
Well, will you not eat something?

1018
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,394
Here you go.

1019
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,955
Yes you have to be half starved.

1020
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,595
I'm looking really thrilled that I met you again.

1021
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,151
So that I would really never expected. It's been so long.

1022
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,913
That's what happens when you do not call back.

1023
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,232
Ah, the time passed in a flash and then I was a comet.

1024
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,879
Yes, we know that.

1025
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,317
You were the Sun King, and I was one of your groupies interchangeable.

1026
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,115
No, that's not true.

1027
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,754
I see already, you do not believe me, but it really is not true.

1028
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,754
Otherwise I would not have picked you up.

1029
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,871
What do you think? Is there a chance

1030
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,640
that we both have to start over again after 21 years?

1031
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,875
Would you want that?

1032
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,556
Why not you?

1033
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,916
Perhaps we can also still set a child.

1034
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,596
Why not?

1035
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:05,320
Great God, Lex You're still a child herself. Of almost 60 years.

1036
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,470
Sag mal ...

1037
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:17,238
, 1992, 9 March for three clock at night, the whole background choir in your bed.

1038
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,274
Since I was pregnant with you.

1039
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,431
Do not worry, I do not want any alimony from you.

1040
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,475
I got rid of it leave.

1041
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,520
Otherwise, it might now with your youngest Binge drinking.

1042
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,150
Fuck.

1043
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,875
Hey, I can now make up for it.

1044
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,910
Bastard!

1045
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,231
Hi.

1046
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,235
How was it?

1047
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,873
It is really a great woman.

1048
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,357
And do you carry it in your bed tonight?

1049
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,470
No. Is not quite so simple with her.

1050
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,315
I'm the big bad wolf.

1051
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,516
Oh, I see.

1052
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,393
What do you have big ears?

1053
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,197
I can hear you better!

1054
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,751
And what do you have for a very big mouth.

1055
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,477
Then I can kiss you better!

1056
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,551
And what do you have for a loud bell?

1057
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,479
I hear too often.

1058
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,997
Would you please open times? I have absolutely no desire to fact.

1059
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,070
Who can that be?

1060
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,157
I have no idea. I do not care.

1061
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,111
Jacky?

1062
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,635
Has a key.

1063
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,514
Okay. I'll get it.

1064
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,674
Oh, you is very good.

1065
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,117
Hello?

1066
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,071
Mama? Mama?

1067
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,438
You have to get out of here. - Way? Why?

1068
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,476
Yes, because I say so, go!

1069
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,716
But how? I can not fly yet.

1070
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,950
Maybe over the balcony.

1071
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:36,791
Good idea.

1072
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,031
Tell me, are you crazy? I'm not an acrobat.

1073
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,150
Then pretend you were one!

1074
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,511
Mama? Mama!

1075
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,318
And, and.

1076
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,714
Ah. Hey.

1077
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,719
Hey, surprise. Were you still in bed?

1078
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,956
Yes, I'm taking a nap.

1079
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,269
But what are you doing here?

1080
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,232
Oh, the weather was so awful at home.

1081
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,276
What? Really?

1082
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,439
Ein tolles Apartment, echt.

1083
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,756
Yeah, pretty, is not it? And such a beautiful view.

1084
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,150
I put my things sometimes just in the bedroom, that's okay?

1085
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,640
No, the Deputy things only to the bathroom,

1086
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,319
I can now quickly clean up the bedroom.

1087
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,431
Are you still not gone? Get out on the spot. Get out!

1088
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,074
I have a surprise for you. Should I give it to you right?

1089
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,356
This is much too high.

1090
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,954
Just because someone fell from the balcony?

1091
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,719
But never. How do you say that?

1092
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,795
How disgusting.

1093
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,116
What's this?

1094
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,479
This is a boy.

1095
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,636
No, this is from a man

1096
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,592
Oh. Is he a good guy?

1097
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,592
No, a man Young man

1098
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,760
Also our Callboy.

1099
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,517
Oh, where do you think they going, child? He's just a nice young man

1100
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,875
It was a one-night stand. So that is it?

1101
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,235
You want a drink?

1102
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,395
Yes. Mom, are you drinking again but not too much sherry, right?

1103
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,159
Are you crazy? Do you know what it costs here?

1104
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,431
A simple glass of water already costs 17 euros.

1105
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,074
Oh, hallo!

1106
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,272
Hey Maartje! - Hallo Jacky.

1107
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,800
Hallo, ich bin Irma. - Hola.

1108
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,550
What did he say?

1109
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,472
I do not care. I did not intend to chat with him.

1110
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,878
Well, welcome to Ibiza.

1111
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,553
What was that for a fucking boat? I am kotzübel. Was totally stupid.

1112
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,391
Terrible.

1113
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,240
I think about you all the time.

1114
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,636
I also.

1115
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,800
Vom ersten Moment an.

1116
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,199
As long as you're thinking of me?

1117
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,190
Kevvie! Kevvie, das Tor ist kaputt.

1118
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,273
Kevvie!

1119
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,396
Kevvie!

1120
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,395
Kevvie, where have you been so long? Why do you make me wait?

1121
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,513
I just had a meeting. For your birthday.

1122
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,639
And you can still make use of this, the lesbian?

1123
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,399
My birthday is tomorrow and you see nothing.

1124
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,398
You will never forget this day.

1125
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,160
Kevvie. You hot striker, du

1126
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,191
Elza, look.

1127
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,993
You're on the front page. - "Stand before wedding?"

1128
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,192
Oh, I look great. - What? Fuck.

1129
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,037
Who told the press that? May!

1130
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,720
You are in my fucking house and abusing my trust!

1131
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,069
Hey, I like to alternate as best man available.

1132
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,998
For when the wedding is planned for, and where you want to celebrate?

1133
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,275
I did not do anything yet.

1134
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,874
But the wedding must organize not miss this lesbian.

1135
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,792
And I want to go to Las Vegas! Honey, look at this,

1136
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,071
what is this pretty picture of me.

1137
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,510
I have very clear ideas of our wedding.

1138
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,632
The wedding dress must of course be quite exclusive.

1139
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,597
Musst du ... ...

1140
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,030
Can not you call your mothers? The always clarify everything.

1141
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,480
No, this time you need to clarify that, Pop.

1142
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,914
Okay. - So to see ...

1143
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,956
Okay.

1144
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,389
Is something wrong?

1145
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,597
There is obviously stress between us you Zara.

1146
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,358
Shit, who hath not even stress?

1147
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,432
Pop. - Everyone has stress it out, right?

1148
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,311
I was with Pim, so ... in bed.

1149
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,271
Pim?

1150
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,151
Pim?

1151
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,356
The man from Zara?

1152
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:10,360
Baby. But you can get something much better.

1153
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,119
I was there just like it.

1154
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,995
You did of me.

1155
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,759
And I got it from Jimi Hendrix.

1156
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,557
Was?

1157
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,519
Well, we made the stop as an artist. So David Bowie made that too,

1158
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,917
and the people of Duran Duran, the boys from Wham ...

1159
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,239
Well, that made it different again.

1160
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,589
What did you do then?

1161
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,076
I just thought that all of life is a game

1162
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:42,479
the women, the drugs, the alcohol, everything, you know?

1163
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,676
And if you wanted to have sex with the girlfriend of his brother,

1164
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,956
then made to the newly easy. So what?

1165
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,434
Zara should not have.

1166
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,760
Yes, my goodness, a number with his brother,

1167
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,839
what are we talking about here? But we no longer live in the Middle Ages.

1168
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,637
Bieb.

1169
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,475
I will iron out this shit for you, yes?

1170
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,516
My treasure.

1171
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,798
Sit down with us. - Shut up.

1172
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,033
Bibi! You breasts loose bitch.

1173
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,509
Girls, we should talk about it in peace.

1174
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,556
Du Furie!

1175
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,909
I'll make you cold!

1176
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,317
Stop it! It was simply just sex.

1177
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,638
Now I've got you, you bitch!

1178
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,590
Beib are! You bitch!

1179
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,594
Let's talk, girls!

1180
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,636
Zara! Zara! There auf!

1181
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,476
No!

1182
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,956
Zara! Liebling!

1183
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,874
Bitch! When I'm done with you, you never fuck again!

1184
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,912
I ask you to stop but only once this old white Indians.

1185
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,070
What? You shut your mouth yet!

1186
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,433
Papa! - Lass mich!

1187
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,591
Paps?

1188
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,275
Hey, Dad.

1189
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,674
Hello sweetie.

1190
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,876
How are you?

1191
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,714
I'm feeling like I had something to smoke weed a lot.

1192
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,672
Say, is not you dizzy?

1193
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,351
No.

1194
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,550
I was almost one real father.

1195
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,672
Oh my God. Is he dead?

1196
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,276
Of course not, silly goose. He sleeps.

1197
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,438
Okay, then this is perhaps the right time to time to talk.

1198
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,631
Bieb!

1199
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,071
But I'm not so much for speeches. - Oh no.

1200
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,116
This time you are but for once for talking, okay?

1201
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,875
Sorry. Es tut mir echt resourceful.

1202
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,150
It was my fault, I started.

1203
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,674
Was it fun?

1204
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,598
No, actually it was over before I had removed the bikini.

1205
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,830
Typical.

1206
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,071
Irma!

1207
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,914
If Voque makes the photos tomorrow morning, I'll get it yet. Why did you do it?

1208
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,196
I called and they offered to bring it over.

1209
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,000
I get them from the same.

1210
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,077
Well, then maybe we can still talk to each other.

1211
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,398
Why do you plan our relationship crises

1212
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,557
always in the most important moments of my career?

1213
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,673
Perhaps it's because you're always obnoxious at times.

1214
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,637
Oh ...

1215
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,191
Sorry.

1216
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,396
And.

1217
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,317
Fuck!

1218
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,469
Comm. - And, and.

1219
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,389
Hey. I am Lars. Your mother's friend.

1220
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,150
No, you're not.

1221
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,960
Comm, Maartje, wir gehen.

1222
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,474
It simply makes no sense.

1223
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,677
Hey! Did you come with me?

1224
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,400
Do you find me pretty enough as a birthday child?

1225
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,873
And as an engaged couple?

1226
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:14,956
Sag was.

1227
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,399
El oh, you look beautiful.

1228
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,436
Let's party!

1229
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,472
It's my birthday! - A great Birthday Girl.

1230
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,550
Happy birthday!

1231
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,319
What is? Why have not you done? You must hurry, man

1232
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,193
Make you ready, or do not you?

1233
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,674
Leave me alone.

1234
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,031
Happy birthday to you...

1235
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,710
Happy birthday! Partytime!

1236
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,594
Yeah! Party today is done!

1237
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,234
Yeah, well. A soccer player? Is that really reasonable?

1238
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:57,760
I mean, they are like their balls. The air but only in their minds, right?

1239
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,076
Dear, I truly believe that he has only kidding yourself.

1240
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,480
So these people are now times.

1241
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,557
You only want to have a little fun before they get married.

1242
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,194
He is the first.

1243
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,916
Was?

1244
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,633
In you're in love?

1245
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,075
Really?

1246
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,756
And all the others were the ... - This is different.

1247
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,712
I did not think such a thing is possible.

1248
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,911
Wow.

1249
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,471
Shit.

1250
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,476
What are you doing?

1251
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,233
Going out. Just like you.

1252
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,835
Dad, you're only just fallen into the pool.

1253
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,078
But I'm also just turned 55, and we now celebrate.

1254
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,912
Okay. Stop it.

1255
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,994
You put on this suit.

1256
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,998
Since you have always a very nice ass it.

1257
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,399
I'm still your father.

1258
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,398
Yes, but a father with a nice ass.

1259
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,511
Hallo? - Mama?

1260
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,636
Hi, sweetheart.

1261
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,554
Dad is so funny and he has been crying for hours.

1262
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,759
What's going on? Did he say what, honey?

1263
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,317
He is now sitting here with a lot of women with long legs,

1264
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,518
and I think that he just wasted all your bikinis.

1265
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:21,512
Is he now completely bonkers?

1266
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,479
Boyd, Dylan, ihr Seid see section!

1267
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,193
Hi.

1268
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,951
Wo ist Jacky?

1269
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,355
Do not know, no idea.

1270
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,270
Well, thank you.

1271
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,359
It's all organized. The dancers are ready.

1272
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:48,837
Armin then hangs up the music for you, and when you come,

1273
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,794
you and he projected onto a large screen and Elza.

1274
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,590
You hand her your birthday gift and then, well ...

1275
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,434
Have a nice evening, Kevin.

1276
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,670
Hey, Lizzy, well worth it.

1277
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,756
And we?

1278
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,751
We are not. We had sex, and sex is not so important.

1279
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,758
Everyone who comes to the island having sex.

1280
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,837
But I would still see you, Lizzy.

1281
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,674
You know what I want? I so want a boy like you,

1282
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,673
but for me alone. Someone I can imagine my family.

1283
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,876
For you.

1284
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,469
What's this?

1285
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,110
Ein Smartphone.

1286
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,833
But I have already a new smartphone.

1287
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,000
This is for your birthday.

1288
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,634
And what about the marriage proposal?

1289
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:27,836
Comes after. After the dancers.

1290
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,832
But the penguins? - They can not.

1291
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,479
Are they at another party?

1292
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,553
No. Penguins tolerate no fireworks. I had to decide

1293
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:39,280
Penguins or fireworks. I decided for the fireworks.

1294
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,955
Come on finally! The whole world is watching us.

1295
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:00,550
I do not want to.

1296
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,990
I'm sorry.

1297
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,199
Kevin! Kevin!

1298
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,669
Real madness!

1299
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:38,436
Zhivago!

1300
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:02,591
Pim!

1301
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,597
Zara.

1302
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:10,240
What is this? What have you done with my bikinis, du ..

1303
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,310
Quiet, calm down.

1304
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,392
What? I will not calm down. I can not get it to Ibiza ...

1305
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,430
Das ist and ... Hi.

1306
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,439
Baby, your bikinis are fan-freaking-tastic.

1307
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,152
I want to have on the cover of Beau Monde.

1308
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,157
I'll take you stand out. Huge!

1309
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,195
I thought I had to make up something.

1310
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,754
And what shall become of us?

1311
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,353
I would like to do more, as before.

1312
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,674
Even though I travel through the world with a suitcase full of bikinis?

1313
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,272
In a hundred go to Milan. And to China?

1314
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,355
And thus will always be obnoxious?

1315
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,079
Ja. Auch dann.

1316
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,720
But do you want to stay with me?

1317
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,437
I ...

1318
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,591
Fred, turquoise fits much better to purple.

1319
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,557
Zara,

1320
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:16,034
do not throw it all away.

1321
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:48,716
Jacky?

1322
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,360
Jacky, I beg you ...

1323
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,117
Lizzy!

1324
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,280
Go back again, Kevin.

1325
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,080
I will not let you go.

1326
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,874
I was just what organized for you. Now go back again.

1327
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,110
I can not go back.

1328
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,997
You belong there, that is your life.

1329
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,155
And where do you belong?

1330
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,712
Not in your villa and not in your life.

1331
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:26,151
Come here.

1332
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,753
Do not do that

1333
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:36,791
Lizzy!

1334
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,791
Was?

1335
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:48,439
I stand here and hold my heart in my hands. And I give it to you.

1336
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,433
Please do not drop it.

1337
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,756
I admit it: Jacky, I love you.

1338
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,716
I do not hope that you also bring out the CD.

1339
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,476
A good idea.

1340
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,471
You know, no idea how it will run, Grandpa.

1341
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,873
But if you want, we could just try.

1342
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:23,479
Only on one condition: that you never call me again Grandpa.

1343
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,795
Ist gut. Opa!

1344
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,953
I do not belong to the villa.

1345
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:36,754
Or in such a life.

1346
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:47,040
Even if you were to score three goals in a single game,

1347
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,951
still always with me you have to put out the garbage.

1348
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,833
Nothing I'd rather do than that

1349
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,954
Ibiza!

1350
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,915
Elza!

1351
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,873
This is for my bedside.

1352
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,836
Despite the qualities of their manager ...

1353
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,474
Up ... the two young DJs ...

1354
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,199
On ... the DJ Olympus.

1355
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,192
Hey, I've heard, you're both DJs.

1356
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,158
I love DJs.

1357
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:18,516
Pope?

1358
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,516
Pope?

1359
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:26,995
Mama ist da!

1360
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,235
Mama! Mama!

1361
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,475
Hello, you two. Hey ...

1362
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,830
Glad you're here. I missed you.

1363
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,755
They are naked.

1364
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,078
Naked and hungry.

1365
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,954
Hungry like a lion!

1366
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,477
Hey, Bursche.

1367
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,910
Hey Lex, Happy Birthday. - Well, at last you put it in front of us times.

1368
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:29,592
I've actually also you always want to try.

1369
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:30,870
Really? - Yes.

1370
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,394
Well, here it is for you.

1371
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,833
Is the strong stuff.

1372
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,677
Here tried this. It tastes delicious.

1373
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,714
Oh dear, I'm so glad that I have you,

1374
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,635
after this terrible time with this football player.

1375
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,670
Thank you.

1376
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,879
With us it is different. Because we have two really love each other.

1377
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,276
We do not want to get married? Yes ...

1378
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,400
Here, I'll help you.

1379
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,716
Hello?

1380
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:33,751
Hey?

1381
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,064
