1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,167
This is Gianfranco Pacciarelli
from the Olympic Stadium in Rome.

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:10,250
In this day, on which Rome
was born 2,700 years ago,...

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,083
...the regional groups, coming
from any part of Italy...

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,333
...to celebrate the folkloristic
national day,...

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:20,250
...are making their entrance into
the Ivory Stadium of 100,000 People.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,792
Too bad that our radio listeners
can't watch this and the show...

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,875
...made by the large and passionate
Roman public, crowding terraces...

8
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:31,500
...and welcoming the pleasant
and picturesque guests...

9
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:34,167
...during this day dedicated
to Romulus.

10
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:04,917
Torture Me But Kill Me with Kisses

11
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,083
Marisa!

12
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,875
What? Are you under a spell?
Dance, c'mon!

13
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,250
Let's go, missus, stop chatting!

14
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,708
Let's go, the bus is leaving!
- I'm here, don't shout.

15
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,292
Oh, Padova, do you play or drink?
A tiny bit of it for me too, c'mon!

16
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,792
Catania group, gather!

17
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,958
C'mon, Toni, let's go!

18
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,542
Marisa!
Hey! Marisa!

19
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,417
Let us touch your tits!

20
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,000
This Roman people aren't so
polite.

21
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,833
Tired?

22
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,750
Well, they have made us go
hiking so long, after all.

23
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,708
Have you enjoyed Rome?
- Well, so and so.

24
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,833
Not so much.

25
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,750
Hold it for a while, Teresa.
- No problem, I'll hold it.

26
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,458
May I introduce myself?

27
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,375
Balestrini Marino.

28
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,958
Her name's Di Giovanni Marisa.

29
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,458
Why are you meddling in it?

30
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,250
Di Giovanni Marisa's a nice name.

31
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,167
Would you like a licorice
chewing gum?

32
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,208
No, thanks! It makes my teeth black.
- Marisa!

33
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,958
Let's go!
- Oh, my dad again, let's go, c'mon!

34
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,542
Please.
- I'm coming!

35
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,667
That guy is so handsome.

36
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,792
He's become a man, anyhow,
and then...

37
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:32,542
...has he anything like Little
Tony? Just the lock. - I like him.

38
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,500
Sacrofante, Marche?
- Yes.

39
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,750
Thanks.

40
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,875
Excuse me, where's the town?

41
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,083
Over there, behind the mountains.

42
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,375
If you go the shortcut, it's 3,5
or almost 4 km far from here.

43
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,625
Not further.

44
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,667
Any means of transport?
- What?

45
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,292
Many thanks.

46
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,542
Where did that madman with a
luggage get out of?

47
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:02,125
He must have been airdropped!

48
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,792
What are you doing, Marisa?
Are you under a spell?

49
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,417
Miss!

50
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,375
Miss Marisa!

51
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,958
Don't you remember me?

52
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,583
Balestrini Marino.

53
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:43,083
We already met.
- Where? In Ancona?

54
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,958
Not exactly.

55
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,583
In San Benedetto del Tronto,
l'Aquila or Pescasseroli?

56
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,292
You travel a lot. - Travelling
is understanding, as it's said.

57
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,583
Even deep thoughts are inside
such a nice looking girl.

58
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,667
It happened in Rome last April,
don't you remember?

59
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,583
It may be, I've forgot.

60
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,708
I haven't got my thoughts in
order about it.

61
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,500
Where are you going?
It's so cold.

62
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,375
To the male trousers factory.
- Well done.

63
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,000
Why don't you ask me:
"Why are you here?"

64
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,083
Me here?
- No, me!

65
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,792
Don't you ask?
- No.

66
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,042
I arrived here by train just
a hour ago.

67
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,125
Did you go the shortcut?

68
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,167
Yes.

69
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:29,125
If you had gone the sealed road,
you'd have easily come here in 5'.

70
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,958
They used to go the shortcut
in the old age.

71
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,833
Alright, anyway...

72
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,042
I was able to find a job for
me here at Sacrofante.

73
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,792
But the main reasons why I've
moved here are two.

74
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:48,792
As to the second one, if you allow
me, you already know what I mean.

75
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,500
Sorry but I'm not so interested
in one of the two reasons!

76
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,167
Yes.

77
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,875
Ditto for the second one.

78
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,625
Yes.

79
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,042
As to the third one, I'm not used to
talk to the first guy coming along.

80
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,125
That's right.

81
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,375
Good morning.
- Good morning.

82
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,292
Balestrini Marino, you're
here for me!

83
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,583
You came a long way for me!

84
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,583
My heart is beating so fast now!

85
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,917
BARBERSHOP

86
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,125
Mr Pittiluti Vincenzo?
- Here he is.

87
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:32,625
Thanks.

88
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,417
The door!
- Yes.

89
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,000
Good morning.

90
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,208
Here.

91
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,958
On the basis of your request
for an experienced worker...

92
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,833
...on the bullettin of Barbers'
Association from Ancona.

93
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,208
Any references?

94
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,708
This is due to my wife, who
has lighted the little stove.

95
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:57,000
For the last two years I've been
working at The Passenger's House...

96
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,750
...in Frosinone and for a year
at Remo and Jolanda's, in Rieti.

97
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,458
Beauty salon.

98
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,083
Here's the pink slip signed
by Mr Remo.

99
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,458
Countersigned by Jolanda too,...

100
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,458
...if you want to check.
- How do you taper hair?

101
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,417
By the point of scissors.
- Hair clipper?

102
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,250
I avoid it.
- How do you clip hair?

103
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,958
By simple and serrated scissors.

104
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,375
Traditional hairstyles?

105
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,833
Regular haircut: Oberdan,
Mascagni or Umberta style.

106
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,792
Also a special touch for comb-over:
simple, turned over or reverse.

107
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,708
A speciality of mine:
friction with egg yolk,...

108
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,833
...with white for wilted hair
bulbs.

109
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,083
Modern hairstyles?

110
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,958
Sculpture by razor, candle
scorched haircut,...

111
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,542
...lengthening of curls by blow
drier, teasing, Ringo style,...

112
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,500
...crew cut, curtained, layered,
pointed, pear-shaped hairstyle...

113
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,917
...and I can make the long hairstyle
too, though it's passed its peak.

114
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,583
But if needed...

115
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,125
Ok, let's see what you can do
with Mr Tortorelli.

116
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,375
Nice head!

117
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,583
Is this your usual haircut or
have you ridden a motorbike?

118
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,292
Sit down there, Mr Tortorelli.

119
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,125
I want someone to take care
of my hands. - Manicure!

120
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:06,542
A man?

121
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,792
It'd be too unscrupulous to
employ a woman for that!

122
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,708
Right.

123
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,042
And with the spring coming...

124
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,625
I've caught you, rascal!

125
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,417
Let me go or I'll call the priest
now, you know? - I doubt it.

126
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,042
You're too self confident,
Casanuova!

127
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,625
I admit...
Where are you going now?

128
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,375
Sit down here for a while!

129
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:59,417
Any chance of a kiss after these
three months of love quarrels?

130
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,000
Let time run its course, rogue!

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,292
Alright, as you like.

132
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,083
Try to catch me!
- No, stop running,...

133
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,583
...it can do harm to you.

134
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,333
No, come here.
Marisa!

135
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,875
Where has she gone now?

136
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,583
Marisa! Where are you?

137
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,292
Well, I'm going away, ok?
I'll go back to Don Antonio.

138
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,583
I go and play blindman's bluff,
so I'll have more fun.

139
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:33,333
I'm sure that in this great
immensity...

140
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:37,125
...someone thinks about me
and won't forget about me,...

141
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:41,000
...and one day I'll find a
little of love for me too,...

142
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:47,458
...for me who am a nothing,
in such an immensity...

143
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,958
I like the music, not the lyrics,
though.

144
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,708
These are lyrics for lovers,
like me and you.

145
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,625
Oh, many thanks!
So, must I be a nothing?

146
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,917
Meaning a nothing if compared
to the immensity...

147
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,167
...of all the things surrounding
us.

148
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,542
This doesn't convince me at all.
Our love itself is an immensity.

149
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,875
Nothing must be all the other
things, if ever.

150
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,708
In the sense that nothing exists
outside it?

151
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,000
Meaning outside of our love?

152
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,708
It's obvious.

153
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,000
It may be.
After all, this idea's also in...

154
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,250
...the song "There's a white
house".

155
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,083
Wait and I'll read it all for
you.

156
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:31,000
Lara, I'll love you for all my life!
- Now we've to leave each other, Yuri.

157
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,667
Goodbye forever, goodbye!

158
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,125
And step aside!

159
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,083
Will you let me watch this
Doctor Zhivago or not?

160
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,667
No, don't look at me like that,
Lara!

161
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:45,167
I'll never forget our little
house in the snow.

162
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,500
Yuri, my love!
- Shall we meet again in Moscow?

163
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,167
If God is going to help us.

164
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,583
Goodbye, Lara!
- Goodbye, Yuri!

165
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,625
My love, goodbye!
- Goodbye!

166
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,583
Goodbye!

167
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,917
Nazareno, is there a seat free?
- No.

168
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,500
Oh my!
There's my dad!

169
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,000
Where?

170
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,458
Behind there.

171
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,833
Excuse me!

172
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,000
Ouch!

173
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:22,542
Yuri, help!
- Victor Komarovsky, stop!

174
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,583
I'll never ever give my
blessing to you, never!

175
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,333
Get my words stuck in your mind!

176
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,958
Wretch, never!

177
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,375
You're the daughter of a great
artist!

178
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,958
Don't ever forget it!

179
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,792
That guy is nothing but a bungler,
that's what he's!

180
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:43,458
He's young and will fight his way

181
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,875
Young? But he might be your
father!

182
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,000
He's smart, learned and...

183
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,750
...if you want to know, he
even won the silver scissors!

184
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,167
Forget those silver scissors,
he's penniless!

185
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,167
Listen, you'll leave that
guy right away!

186
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,000
Or rather, bloody hell!

187
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:05,542
I'll smash and bury you
under this stone!

188
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,750
AMALIA AND LIBERO
UNITED FOREVER

189
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,625
When you read this letter,...

190
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,125
...it'll be too late to stop the
insane gesture by the undersigned.

191
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,458
Victims of the world's egoism...

192
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,708
...and of the poor understanding
towards us, young people.

193
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:24,958
Will we ever forgive who's
driven us to do that? Certainly.

194
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,292
Regret will take care of making
him suffer.

195
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,167
The undersigned won't be alone
in the immensity,...

196
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,000
...but will stay with the memory
of those who were kind to them,...

197
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,833
...though they're a very few ones.

198
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,292
Yours truly,...

199
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,667
...Balestrini Marino
and Di Giovanni Marisa.

200
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,000
The train's late.

201
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:57,125
The butterflies are the souls
of the dead.

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,708
Marino, will we become butterflies
too?

203
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,750
It may be.

204
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,583
Excuse me.

205
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,375
Poor dad, who knows how long
he will cry...

206
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,542
He will learn the lesson then.

207
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,125
Here it is.

208
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,042
Don't be afraid, Marisa.

209
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,292
I'm here with you.

210
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,333
I'm you and you're me...

211
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:48,417
Who dies first, suffers less.

212
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,167
Do you want to take my place?

213
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,917
No, thanks.

214
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,250
Marisa!
- Marino!

215
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,750
Look, these two wretches!

216
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,208
Just my luck! It's always
something with me!

217
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,625
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

218
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,833
Just under my train?
- Do your duty and go ahead!

219
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,208
Forget going ahead, blast you!

220
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,500
In any case we won't move away.
- No? Come!

221
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,375
Keep your hands off the lady's
legs, you know!

222
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,333
I'll tear out her leg, got it?!

223
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,292
No, you won't tear out just
anything, got it?

224
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,792
What a horrible intention!

225
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,667
What has driven you to such
a decision?

226
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:58,208
Never despair, my sons, Providence
gives according to need.

227
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,083
Its name itself says that.

228
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,833
Providence gives according to need!

229
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,250
HERE LIES THE UNFORGETTABLE ARTIST
ARTEMIO DI GIOVANNI

230
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,083
FAIR, HONEST AND GENEROUS

231
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,875
HE HIMSELF CARVED IT
1910 - 1968

232
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:03,292
But temptation nested at the
Adelaide's guest house.

233
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:09,458
I'm sure that in this great
immensity...

234
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:17,042
...someone thinks about me and
won't forget about me.

235
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,875
What a manly voice this guy has.

236
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,458
He makes my blood boil.

237
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,375
I won't be alone all my life
long...

238
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,375
...and one day...

239
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,917
...I'll find...

240
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,917
...a little of love for me too,...

241
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,833
...for me who...

242
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:51,125
...am a nothing in the immensity...
blast you!

243
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,000
What's up?
- Young master, coffee's ready.

244
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,500
Thanks, madam Adelaide.

245
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,042
But you still didn't notice
I don't use to drink...

246
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,583
...coffee during these three
months I've been staying here?

247
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,125
Marino, you'll make me do
something crazy.

248
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,750
Agreed, but you can't even
give chase to me...

249
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,708
...as if you were a man and me
a woman.

250
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,667
Why are you so obstinate?

251
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,875
But with so many handsome young
men all around,...

252
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,375
...it's not hard to choose!

253
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,208
Since my poor Eugenio died,...

254
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,292
...I haven't been looking at a
man's face, as I'm so serious.

255
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,417
I don't doubt it, madam, and
understand you. I'm a man too.

256
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,542
Maybe you just happen to be
in heat now,...

257
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,333
...but t will pass, you'll see.

258
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,125
Why are you rejecting me,
am I so bad looking maybe?

259
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,917
No, not at all, madam.

260
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,250
But it's not tactless of me, it's
just that I'm already engaged.

261
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,667
Marino!

262
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,583
Tell me, madam.

263
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,042
Go along with me!
- Gladly, but I can't.

264
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:32,000
Next month I'll get married,
ouch.

265
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:35,500
One more reason to indulge your whim.
- I never drew back!

266
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,625
Oh, but you're biting!

267
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,417
A little kiss at least, little
Marino, be good!

268
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,875
You've just gone wild today,
let's try to stay good friends.

269
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,667
What would I do with your friendship?
- Come!

270
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,917
Marino!
- You make me be late, madam.

271
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,125
And I've still to wash my feet!

272
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,875
You're horny!
- How rude!

273
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,667
Do you think that, if I had no
right to do, I'd have done it?

274
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,500
I'm a lady, you know, more than
many other women, got it?

275
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:04,333
If another woman does it again and
again, it's fine for you, isn't it?

276
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,750
Close your eyes, hence a widow
like me has more right to do it!

277
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,667
A 20 aged woman would be filthier
if she did that, I do tell you!

278
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,000
Who are you alluding to?
- To a bride-to-be.

279
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,375
That is?

280
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,250
That is, madam?

281
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,292
May my lips be sealed.

282
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,333
Who are you alluding to, madam?

283
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,458
Swallow, keep quiet, don't talk
about that.

284
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:34,333
Frankness is an enemy of love.
- No, you'll talk now! Ouch!

285
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:41,458
Listen, madam,...

286
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,375
...I've always been like a
gentleman with you.

287
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,417
But if you don't talk now,...

288
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,083
...I won't even follow manners
and will beat you, you know?

289
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,542
Marino, don't let me say a
thing you couldn't like!

290
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,958
Ouch! - What will I do, must
I break this?

291
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,833
So swear on your mother you won't
tell anybody what I'll say to you!

292
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,042
Alright, I swear.

293
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:05,167
I don't know anything precisely,
only by hearsay.

294
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,208
When the priest organized a mixed
pilgrimage to Assisi last year,...

295
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,833
...also Marisa went to.

296
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,292
So what?

297
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,917
When the pullman left again,
Marisa wasn't on it.

298
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,000
She preferred to spend a night
with another man in a hotel.

299
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,375
In a hotel...and with whom?

300
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,458
Scortichini Guido, who works
in a paper mill.

301
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,875
Are you Scortichini Guido?

302
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,875
Yes.

303
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,667
What do you want?

304
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,583
Nothing.

305
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,667
I just wanted to meet you...

306
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,708
...and see your face and who
are you.

307
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,917
So what?

308
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,208
Let time run its course.

309
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,208
And remember that,...

310
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,833
...if you're the Colossus of
Rhodes,...

311
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,708
...I'm not one of Snow White's
dwarfs.

312
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,208
Watch your back, got it?

313
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,125
I've got the proof of your double
life by now, my dear Marisa.

314
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,375
Yes, that's true, I told you
I'm not interested in your past,...

315
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,583
...but it was because I thought
you were pure like a lily!

316
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,375
Who can know whether tomorrow,...

317
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,708
...while you're swearing eternal
love to me, you won't...

318
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
...give yourself away to another
man indecently?

319
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,542
How will be our future?

320
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:42,000
What will I say to my sons when they
see you coming back home at dawn?

321
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,917
That their mother is a whore?

322
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,458
No, go away, dirty bitch,
take!

323
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,833
Don't come into my view anymore,
you know!

324
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,000
Take!

325
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,250
But Marino, excuse me, what
are you doing?

326
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,583
The tonsure, Don Antonio, why?

327
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:56,917
The tonsure?

328
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,708
I'm Don Antonio instead!

329
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,292
Oh, good God! Look what this
guy has done to me!

330
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,458
And now who will fix the
marshal's hair?

331
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:09,667
But...Don Antonio came first.

332
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,167
Sure!

333
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,083
Hello, Marino!

334
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,792
Hi, Teresa. - Don't forget the
umbrella's mine, you know!

335
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:32,583
Teresa and Antonietta have
accepted to be my bridesmaids.

336
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,333
Why?
Aren't you happy?

337
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,417
Yes.

338
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:43,042
Have you also decided where we
shall go for our honeymoon trip?

339
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,958
Is it ok for you Assisi?
Do you know some hotels there?

340
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,083
Marino, what are you saying?

341
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,000
Once you took offence because I hid
the fact that I wear glasses from you!

342
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:54,458
Yes! Pretend you don't remember
that!

343
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:57,250
You told I'm not sincere, you
even said to me: hypocrite!

344
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes, madam.

345
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:02,250
I use to wear glasses,
I'm astigmatic.

346
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:05,333
But to be astigmatic is not
dishonourable at all, you know?

347
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,750
It's more dishonourable going
to hotels.

348
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,542
I'm you and you're me!

349
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,333
No, my dear, because, if I were
you, I'd be disgusting for myself!

350
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,750
What are you doing?
No reactions?

351
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,792
You don't answer, I know, and
don't defend yourself!

352
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,292
So I will speak.

353
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:25,083
And I say only one thing:
Scortichini, with all due respect.

354
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,292
What's your answer?

355
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:32,792
It's the second time, I inform
you there won't be a third one!

356
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,042
Lara!

357
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,917
Yuri, my love, help!

358
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:47,083
Help!

359
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,208
I'm coming, Lara!

360
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,625
Yuri!

361
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,333
Victor Komarovsky, stop!

362
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,792
No!

363
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,708
No!

364
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,458
Murderer!

365
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,625
Poor him, he has been raving
for a week.

366
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,458
Hey!
Wake up!

367
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,750
Are you Victor Komarovsky?

368
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,625
I'm Scortichini Guido.

369
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,833
What are you doing here in Moscow?

370
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,500
He's losing his marbles.

371
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,083
Scortichini!
- You're an idiot!

372
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:52,417
Instead of going crazy, excuse me,
couldn't you ask for an explanation?

373
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,750
What's this nonsense about
Marisa and me?

374
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,917
Hey, Marino, I've brought this
here for an explanation.

375
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:58,542
Yes?

376
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:03,042
I do care a little about you
and that other stupid woman.

377
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:07,875
Last time I talked to her, I was
12 and she was not even 7 years old.

378
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:11,583
Look, I never made a
pilgrimage to Assisi.

379
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,792
Believe me, Marino.

380
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,833
If she went there, she must have
gone there with another man.

381
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,750
Which other man? Believe me, Marisa
has been with me all that day long.

382
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,167
I remember it well, it was the
Saint Francesco's day.

383
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:24,208
October the 4th, a year ago,
it was raining.

384
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:27,167
That's malicious gossip, Marino!

385
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,792
Scandalmongers, talebearers!
People who want to hurt you.

386
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,000
What are you doing?
Are you getting up?

387
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,333
My trousers.
- You're getting up with a fever.

388
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,833
He's getting up.
- I must ask for Marisa's forgiveness.

389
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:45,250
But, my son, you're sick and
may have a collapse. - Marisa!

390
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,333
Give me the trousers.
- I was expecting that, c'mon!

391
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:25,333
Who is it?

392
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:26,792
Marisa!

393
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,000
Marisa has gone to the station
right now.

394
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,542
You've been very bad with her,
she will leave for Rome forever!

395
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,750
Rome?
- To make a new life for herself!

396
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,958
She doesn't want to see you
again, she said!

397
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,000
To Rome, oh my God...

398
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,000
Blast you!
What are you doing?

399
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,625
Who's Marisa?

400
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,042
A blonde girl,...

401
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,417
...leaving for Rome.
- For Rome?

402
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,042
This isn't going to Rome at all!
- Her name is...

403
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,458
It's going to Ancona!

404
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,208
The train for Rome is leaving now,
it's there.

405
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,708
Where's the thingy?
- What?

406
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,333
The thingy.
- Which thingy?

407
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,375
Here it is.
- What are you doing?

408
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,583
I can't make it.

409
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,708
You draw, as I can't make it.

410
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:24,917
I can't make it.

411
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,375
Some days later in the Eternal
City...

412
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,125
Good morning, I'be been seeking...

413
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,000
...this lady for five days for
very urgent reasons.

414
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,667
I know she works in a factory
of sport...

415
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,917
...plants called Toni or Coni,
not featured in the telephone book.

416
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,667
Can you help me to send this
picture...

417
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,625
...to all the police cars,
by any chance?

418
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,875
I don't think so.
- You don't think so, do you?

419
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:12,542
And then can't you see we're
riding on horses?

420
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,583
Anyway, go to the police station.

421
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,750
But I just don't think so,
you know. Coni...

422
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,792
Coni...tell me!

423
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,083
Yes?

424
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:21,958
Have you said "Coni"?

425
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:26,250
Or Comi, Toni, Coni?
- It must be Coni!

426
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,958
Coni's sports facility.

427
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,875
Coni's sports facility?

428
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,750
Indeed!
- Thanks, many thanks.

429
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,750
Yes, ice cream cones!

430
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:53,750
C'mon, lazy girls, leave the
stands and go to H sector!

431
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,583
Your friend Teresa told me
she came to this sports facility...

432
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,250
...holding a position of
responsibility and satisfaction.

433
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,500
Forget responsibility!

434
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,375
She used to come here to clean
the trash after any match,...

435
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,750
...what's that responsibility?

436
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:10,333
The fact is she was always crying
so I told her to piss off.

437
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:11,708
Where has she gone now?

438
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,125
Let's see.

439
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,417
Hey, Concetta!
Where has Marisa gone?

440
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:18,917
No one knows.

441
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,792
No one knows.
- Who's he?

442
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,875
He's asked who you're.
- Her boyfriend.

443
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,958
Her boyfriend!
- Big son of a bitch!

444
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:31,292
He's said you're...
- I've heard.

445
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,167
Well, so, goodbye.

446
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,917
Why don't you ask some employment
agency?

447
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,625
A similar bureau sent her to us.

448
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,792
If she doesn't start to be on
the game, you can find her there.

449
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:42,333
Agency...if she doesn't start to be on
the game, I can find her. - Here.

450
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,000
Will you set my hand free?

451
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,375
It gets stuck sometimes and is
stiff for being a boxer.

452
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:48,875
But I've to go.

453
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,167
C'mon.

454
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,083
Excuse me.
- Bye!

455
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:13,125
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

456
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,125
Have you taken a careful look
at her?

457
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,500
Many people are looking for
waitresses now...

458
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,958
...and all of you want to take
part in the singing contests!

459
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,208
Go and hoe the ground rather,...

460
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:52,292
...as you're not worth to be at
the service at gentlemen's houses!

461
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,417
Shall I be a waitress myself?

462
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,750
C'mon, everything's falling down
of my hands, as I'm butterfingers!

463
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:01,625
Blast you and these four coarse
louts!

464
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,667
Ladies and gentlemen?

465
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,250
May you and the rotten ugly
cuckolds...

466
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,417
...of your fathers drop dead!

467
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,042
Who is?
- May I come in?

468
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:10,875
Provided you've got your fathers.

469
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:13,875
May I ask you for information
please?

470
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,042
Are you a policeman maybe?

471
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:17,667
No, someone has sent me here.

472
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:20,125
I'm looking for...
- A job, I know.

473
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,917
Are you a waiter?
- No.

474
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:25,000
Because many people're looking for
waiters now and would pay good money.

475
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,167
Have you got a pink slip?

476
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,000
No, I haven't.
What's a pink slip?

477
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,167
Oh, don't worry because we use to
write custom made pink slips.

478
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,958
We're not afraid of anything.
- Yes.

479
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,417
Here, we're left with these ones.

480
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,292
Where do I put them, here? - Don't
touch it or everything will fall down!

481
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:39,500
I wanted to ask if you know
this young lady.

482
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,000
Who's?
- Here she's.

483
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,083
Again!

484
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,917
Why again?

485
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:48,083
I said I didn't want to see her
here anymore!

486
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:51,208
To whom?
- Hello?

487
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, this is the Consulate of
Paraguay. Wait, madam.

488
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,167
Say: "I'm the consul's assistant,
I'm putting you through to him now".

489
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:04,750
I'm the consul's assistant, I'm
putting you through to him now.

490
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,125
This is the consul, madam.

491
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,208
Oh, tell me, madam.

492
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:13,708
Cucchiari Emilia has been at our
service as a waiter for two years.

493
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,333
Close the door, can't you feel
how cold it is?

494
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,250
She's very good!
You can hire her certainly.

495
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,417
See you, madam.

496
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,417
So you know her.
- Marisa Di Giovanni, sure!

497
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,417
Who are you?
- I'm...

498
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,458
Do you know that everywhere
I find a job for her,...

499
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,208
...as soon as the master pays
her a compliment,...

500
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,667
...she leaves everything and
goes away?

501
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,125
She thinks she's the only woman
who has got a twat.

502
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,083
It's even happened that once
I slapped in her face so that...

503
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,667
...I made her head spin around!

504
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,750
Meaning what? That you laid your
hands on her?

505
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,833
Do you think she didn't do
anything?

506
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,917
She kicked me on the leg and
almost broke my femur.

507
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:42,750
Look!
- Well I never!

508
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,083
Tell me, where's she now?

509
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,125
Where has she gone?
- What do I know?

510
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,583
I said her: "Go to hell!", but
I don't know whether she has gone.

511
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,167
Well, if you want to be a waiter,
stop by.

512
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,667
But forget her, as it's better...

513
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,750
...to have a dead in your house than
a native from Marche at your door!

514
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,542
Oh, my!

515
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:01,042
If I come into being again, I'd
really be a consul.

516
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,583
The Etruscans used to live in
my region...

517
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:07,792
...and often beat the Romans
gladly!

518
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,792
That's it.

519
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:20,583
M. M. M. I'm searching and
waiting for you, Marisa,...

520
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,833
...in front of the obelisk of
Akezeum.

521
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:26,375
Yes, in front of the obelisk.
- At 12:45.

522
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,000
Quarter to one.
Your brokenhearted Marino.

523
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:29,958
Your Marino.

524
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,000
Excuse me, where is this obelisk,
in Mexico, perhaps?

525
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,958
No, it's actually here,...

526
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,500
...along the archeological
promenade.

527
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,958
Axum!
There's an extra z and k.

528
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,750
Please, fix those errors.

529
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,958
It's that my boarding house's
just in the nearby,...

530
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,625
...otherwise I'd have choosen
a simplier obelisk.

531
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,958
A. A. A.
New very young manicure,...

532
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:55,417
...top of the range, strictly
confidential, no porter.

533
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:58,917
Manicure? Think that the manicure
is actually a man in my town.

534
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:21,958
Marino?

535
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,958
Have you been waiting for me
so long?

536
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,083
To be honest, I wasn't waiting
for you at all.

537
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:31,750
I read your ad on the newspaper.

538
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,625
Oh, yes, but I'm waiting for Marisa.

539
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,583
I'm Marisa.

540
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:42,208
But I'm waiting for another Marisa.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

541
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:45,458
But if destiny has set this
meeting, why giving up?

542
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,667
Why?

543
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:50,833
Goodbye.

544
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,583
May I buy you a drink?
- Please, miss, do not insist.

545
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,042
Let me go along with you at least.
- I don't drink, thanks.

546
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,792
Please, sir...

547
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:12,292
Oh, at last pasta and beans!
- Actually with no pasta and beans.

548
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,708
Boy sad as me, ah, ah...

549
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,458
Do not song while eating.

550
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:27,917
You can recognize a lady from
her manners while eating.

551
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:29,125
Excuse me.

552
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,000
Where are you going?

553
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:41,583
I read an ad and...

554
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,250
U. CICERI
TAILOR

555
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,583
I read your ad on this newspaper...

556
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,458
...for a skilled maker of
trousers.

557
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,708
May I come in?

558
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:30,458
Good morning.

559
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,333
So see you next Thursday for
the fitting.

560
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,167
I go and have dinner, Mr Umberto,
see you.

561
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:49,375
So, what do you say?
Can you hire me?

562
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,083
As I'm in a need of work.

563
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,458
I lodge with the nuns of Santa
Maria Ausiliatrice at Monte Mario.

564
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:02,583
I used to work for a factory of
trousers and now I'd not be here,...

565
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,875
...if only I hadn't had to leave
my town in Marche...

566
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,958
...because of a wicked man.
I thought he loved me.

567
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:16,583
Instead he charged me with such
a dirty thing,...

568
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,833
...just to get rid of me.

569
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:29,375
My poor dad told me not
to trust that man.

570
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,417
It's bur...ning!

571
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:46,625
Mute?

572
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,292
Deaf-mute?

573
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,500
Coffee.

574
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,208
You're very kind.

575
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,083
Bar Quintigliani.

576
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,583
One coffee for Mr Umberto!

577
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:35,708
Two coffees.

578
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,167
He wants the usual hag coffee.

579
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,167
Quick, c'mon!

580
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:55,167
How could I understand him,
if I hadn't been a soldier?

581
00:42:55,792 --> 00:43:02,375
Time goes by but the flame has not
put out inside Marisa's heart yet.

582
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,000
Him?

583
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,000
Love?

584
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,708
Dead?

585
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,333
Your love's dead.

586
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,208
Are you actually sure?

587
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:54,292
Women!

588
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,250
Other women!

589
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:12,625
Marino, the door!
- Oh, was it the bell?

590
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:15,208
Take that for a while, madam.

591
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,750
No, hold the tray! I've to open
the door, just a moment.

592
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:19,208
Where did you find him?
- Marino!

593
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,250
It's incredible!

594
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:22,417
Oh, poor thing, it's a pitiful
case.

595
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,375
He used to be a barber but
they fired him as he did nothing...

596
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,833
...but talking about a woman
named Marisa who left him.

597
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,333
Think that one day a customer
told him off...

598
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,375
...and he put the shaving brush
into his mouth.

599
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:35,625
How nice that mens suffering
for love still exist today.

600
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,667
When I think of that pig of my
husband!

601
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:41,083
Will I carry it?
- No, you take my trench.

602
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,917
Aren't you, miss, feeling well?
- No.

603
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:51,667
Excuse me.

604
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,417
The kitchen is on the right!

605
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:56,917
Here's our general!

606
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,833
Guards, get ready!
- At ease!

607
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:02,542
Show me, what's it in there?
- Oh, a secret!

608
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:04,417
A military secret!

609
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:07,458
Secrets are my middle name,
aren't they, General?

610
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,708
One drop.
- Enough!

611
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,583
Marino! Give me that lemon!
- Right away, mr engineer.

612
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:20,167
Guys, bring out the mayonnaise!
Who has stolen my mayonnaise?

613
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,708
Here's the lemon.
- Oh, thanks, Marino.

614
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:24,292
Any news about that Marisa?

615
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,167
Not at all, my engineer.

616
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,208
I've also gone to the club
of the people from Marche,...

617
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,167
...but unfortunately she didn't
enrol herself as a member.

618
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:32,917
Why don't you talk to the General?

619
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,875
To the General, why?

620
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:38,500
Because he's a member of Sifar!
- Secret Service!

621
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:41,042
Oh, he can find your Marisa
in a very short time.

622
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:41,917
Really?

623
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,708
Rather, go and talk to him
immediately. Go, right now!

624
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,625
But don't tell him that I've
told you! Go, c'mon, quick!

625
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,333
Will you bet I'll win the
first prize? - No!

626
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,208
Sir general...
- What?

627
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,625
May I talk to you about a bit
confidential thing?

628
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,708
Just now!

629
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,625
About what?

630
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,000
A girl unfairly accused has
disappeared.

631
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:06,667
The cream! - The cream?
- Where's the cream?

632
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,292
Well, has a girl disappeared?
- Here's it, I've found it.

633
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,208
Give me.

634
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:14,917
If you were so kind, your help
would be essential.

635
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,333
Just a moment, I didn't
understand anything.

636
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,875
This person, this girl...
- Yes.

637
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,875
Where does she come from?
- From Marche.

638
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,375
Her name's Di Giovanni Marisa.

639
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,083
But, since I've accused her
unfairly of having...

640
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,750
...had a sexual intercourse with
a certain Scortichini Guido,...

641
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,833
...she run away to Rome, got lost
and can't be found anymore.

642
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,125
And you're telling me?

643
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,417
Well, so, if you want, working
for the Secret Service...

644
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,750
Oh, holy smoke!

645
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,500
Can't you understand you're
making my sauce spoil?

646
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,667
Yes.
- God damn!

647
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:41,792
I don't give a shit about your
Marisa Di Giuseppe!

648
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:43,958
Chefs, hurry up!

649
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,250
C'mon, quick, Excellency,
Honourable...

650
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:48,125
Take the turkey, look, it's
heavy, you know!

651
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,417
The dinner is ready and the
contest begins!

652
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,250
Action stations!

653
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:53,250
Careful, gentlemen, the wine's
going to be uncorked!

654
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,833
To each dish its own wine.

655
00:46:55,833 --> 00:47:00,500
And then, get struck, we have
got a Frescobaldi wine from 1911!

656
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,667
Slowly!
- Yes.

657
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,250
Rare example!

658
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,542
A 57 years old wine.

659
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,583
Slowly, do not pull, bend it
gently!

660
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:22,083
Bend it gently, idiot!

661
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:26,750
Very slowly, wretch!

662
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:30,542
Very slowly, if you crush it,
I'll kill you!

663
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:31,875
Yes.

664
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,708
Slowly.

665
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,917
A violet, a candle and a glass.

666
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,917
Have you heard?
Pop, what a voice.

667
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:46,333
Here, engineer.
- Oh, thanks.

668
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:50,208
Here, let's heat its neck well
for a while.

669
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:53,167
Here, now you pour very slowly.

670
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,542
As if it were nitroglycerine.
Slowly, slowly, stop!

671
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:18,250
Oh, holy smoke!
Guys, you have no idea.

672
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,333
My friends, how wonderful!

673
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:24,583
I drank no less than a wine from
Bettino Ricasoli's cellars once,...

674
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,917
...but this is really an unique
wine.

675
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:31,042
It has something recalling the
Medici family, amazing!

676
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,875
Mr engineer.
- Tell me, my dear.

677
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:37,500
We're mistaken and have open
another bottle.

678
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:41,958
It's written "Wine cooperatives
of Velletri 1968" here.

679
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:46,292
Engineer, we blew it!
- Idiot, you're always thinking...

680
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,500
...about that floozy of Marisa
and got the wrong bottle!

681
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:52,125
Idiot!

682
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:56,000
I've the wrong bottle, but
you actually made...

683
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,417
...your mouth move.

684
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:58,708
You've tasted it.

685
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:02,333
Both of us are idiots, if
anything.

686
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,917
How dare you?

687
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:07,042
I'll slap in your face, you know!
- I don't think so, excuse me.

688
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,083
Engineer!

689
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,083
I'll kill you, you know!

690
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:21,917
C'mon!

691
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:27,125
Engineer, you won't get your
hands dirty with a waiter!

692
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:32,500
Here, look at the result.
Let's give the power to the niggers!

693
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:35,500
Automatic long-distance call

694
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:41,750
Hello, Sacrofante Marche,
is it you, Don Antonio?

695
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:44,750
Don Antonio, I'm Marino, I can
talk for a very few seconds!

696
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,542
Don't speak, I've inserted only 3
tokens, the last money I'm left with!

697
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,500
I'm ruined, chased away from
the boarding house,...

698
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,583
...my luggage's been seized,
but this is nothing!

699
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,375
Quiet, Don Antonio, let me speak!

700
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:55,500
I've been looking for Marisa
in vain for 4 months!

701
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,708
She's definitely lost!

702
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:59,000
Answer to these two questions
right away!

703
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,417
First: have you heard about
Marisa from her relatives in case?

704
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,208
Second: can you send me some money?

705
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,833
Don Antonio, answer to me quickly!

706
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,792
Aren't you Don Antonio?

707
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:11,167
Who are you?
Whom am I speaking to?

708
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,917
San Benedetto del Tronto?

709
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,000
But...

710
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,083
San Benedetto...

711
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:39,792
Hello, Piero!

712
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,000
Hi, Piero!

713
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,083
Thanks.

714
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,750
Drink.

715
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,250
Put them in there.

716
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,458
Madam, may I take a nice picture
of your son with Santa Claus?

717
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:38,250
And this handsome boy! Would you
like a picture with Santa Claus?

718
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,167
It's really cold, isn't it?

719
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,417
Who did give you those football
shoes?

720
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:49,042
The Red Cross, they were for
the earthquake victims.

721
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:52,792
Are you in troubles?

722
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,250
May I introduce myself?
I'm Cerioni.

723
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:04,000
You know what you have to do?
Call the Crisis Center.

724
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:07,333
It's a charity, they help
everyone.

725
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:09,375
I was worse than you.

726
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,000
And I called them.

727
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,667
Was the phone line busy?

728
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,875
You don't have to care for
the material things.

729
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:21,000
What matters is your soul's
calm.

730
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:23,083
I'm calm now.

731
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,167
Call, believe me.

732
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:30,292
You can always find someone there,
good doctors, priests, psychiatrists.

733
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:33,667
All volunteers who give advice
and don't ask for money.

734
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:34,833
Everything's free of charge.

735
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,083
Wait.

736
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:51,917
For a token.

737
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:03,542
Here, smile.
Keep still.

738
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:10,708
We can't give advice about
the pill!

739
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,500
Let's not talk about that!

740
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,167
For God's sake!
Just let's not mention it!

741
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,333
What?
- Will you answer?

742
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:27,250
Let's not deal with such subjects,
let's not give such advice!

743
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,167
Hello?

744
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:31,000
Crisis Center?

745
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:33,167
Excuse me, who are you?

746
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,167
Listen, Doctor, I'm going to
commit suicide,...

747
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:40,375
...but they told me to talk
to you first.

748
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:43,542
What do you have to tell me?
- Me? You've to tell me!

749
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:47,333
It's Christmas today, call again
after the holidays.

750
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,292
Yes, no, no!

751
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:56,250
Yes, alright.
Where are you now?

752
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:03,250
Angelo, let's go!

753
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,208
I've always her in my eyes
and in my mind.

754
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,583
Yet think how bizarre it's,...

755
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,708
...or, rather, terrible...

756
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,667
...I can't remember Marisa
sometimes.

757
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,792
You'll say:
"What are you saying, Marino?"

758
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,000
Yes, Doctor.

759
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:21,042
As if she hadn't her face,
without...her image.

760
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,333
It's like an egg.

761
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:28,083
It's even worse then, as
I feel like...

762
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:30,042
...I've lost her forever.

763
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,667
What's the reason?

764
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:35,458
The evil I did to her,...

765
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,292
...or all those pills I was
given by the psychiatrist?

766
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:41,333
Ah, a psychiatrist saw you?
- Yes, Dr Scardiani.

767
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:42,708
Do you know him?
- Yes, I do!

768
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:43,958
He's the best, isn't he?

769
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:45,458
Well?
- Yes..

770
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:46,708
Dad, mom said...
- I'm coming right away.

771
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,417
...we had to go!
- I'm coming right away.

772
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:52,125
Nice girls! You've a beautiful
family, Doctor.

773
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,417
Marino. - Tell me.
- Listen carefully.

774
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:57,083
I think that this woman,...

775
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,292
...this Marisa,...
- Yes.

776
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:00,750
...this egg, as you sharply
defined her,...

777
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,833
...doesn't exist.

778
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:04,208
Doesn't she exist?
- She doesn't exist.

779
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,083
Meaning what?

780
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,125
She's just a result of your
imagination.

781
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:14,500
We call it "transactional
need".

782
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,167
Transactional?

783
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,417
In other words,...
- Yes.

784
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,792
Who's Marisa?

785
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,542
She's...my...
- No, Marisa's your mom!

786
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,000
My mom?

787
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,708
Your need for a mother...

788
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,125
...who's probably passed
away very young.

789
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:33,500
Aged 86 years.
- Here, see?

790
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:36,583
It's your imagination, not your
memory,...

791
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,333
...which puts a face to this
being who doesn't exist.

792
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,958
You must react, react!

793
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:45,083
Anyway, we'll deal with this
subject again,...

794
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:46,917
...if you kindly call me back.

795
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,250
But not before Epiphany,
agreed?

796
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,375
Agreed.
- Take.

797
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,667
And seek a female company, Marino,
a real one, though!

798
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:57,292
Tangible, got it?
Everyone needs that sometimes.

799
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:58,500
Agreed?
- Yes.

800
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,208
Happy New Year and have a cigarette.

801
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:03,333
No, thanks, smoking makes me dizzy.
- Alright, smoke after meals then.

802
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:04,958
After meals?

803
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,750
Whose meals?

804
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,292
I've caught you, rascal!

805
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:28,125
Let me go or I'll call the priest
now, you know? - I doubt it.

806
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:31,083
You're too self confident,
Casanuova!

807
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,792
My mom...

808
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:11,833
Ladie and gentlemen, as usual,
Mister Ok is going to celebrate...

809
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:14,792
...his 70th anniversary and
the New Year...

810
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:16,917
...with the customary plunge
into Tiber.

811
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,958
Ladie and gentlemen, give
nicely something to...

812
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,542
...our generous and evergreen
sportsman...

813
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:27,750
..for such funny public attraction,
for such quivering winter,

814
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:30,625
...the water temperature is...

815
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:27,583
So, young man, why did you
do such a stupid action, huh?

816
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:29,792
Well...

817
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,333
The evils of love.

818
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:38,292
What? You're anaemic, malnourished,
unemployed,... - Yes.

819
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:41,792
...homeless and you throw yourself
in the river for the evils of love?

820
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:44,125
You can see that good feelings
still exist.

821
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:45,583
And the idiots too.

822
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:54,583
Tell me.
Hey!

823
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,875
Hey! Mr Evils of love!

824
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,375
Are you sure it's the evils
of love?

825
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:02,667
That's for playing it at the
lottery.

826
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,333
See?
The insane gesture is no. 28.

827
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,083
The river is no. 14.

828
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:10,333
The day is no. 1.

829
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,625
But the reason must be true,
got it?

830
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,042
Because, if it's a bad check,
is no. 62.

831
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:18,458
If it's bankruptcy, it's no. 68.

832
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:20,417
What's bankruptcy?

833
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:22,667
Ah, hence it's not bankruptcy.

834
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:24,833
So it's the evils of love,
it's no. 32.

835
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,375
Let's become partners, are you in?

836
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:28,667
100 lire each.

837
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:32,333
Oh, were you cuckolded, maybe?

838
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,833
Because, if you were cuckolded,
it's no. 58.

839
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:38,167
Balestrini Marino, who's?

840
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:40,833
Here.

841
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,125
There's a lady who wants to talk
to you, take the bedpan away.

842
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:10,792
Marisa!

843
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:12,917
Is that really you?

844
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,333
Yes, Marino.

845
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:23,500
This can't be Marisa,
it's just a dream.

846
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:27,208
Take a seat.

847
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:29,500
How are you?

848
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:32,000
Sit down, make yourself comfortable
here.

849
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:34,583
Marisa!

850
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,333
Marisa!

851
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,500
How do I look?
A bit down, right?

852
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,292
Do I look a bit down?

853
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,500
No.

854
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,625
How nicely you've done your beard.

855
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:57,125
I had to sell my razor.

856
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,333
Since my hand was starting
to tremble a bit,...

857
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,333
...I could no longer work.

858
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:06,000
I'm feeling better now, but...

859
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:08,792
...once, well, my hand
was trembling.

860
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,583
How did you come to know?

861
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:14,250
On a newspaper.

862
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:17,083
I thought I was going to die.
- Me too.

863
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,333
Mister Ok saved my life.

864
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,083
I was cursing him, but now I'm
blessing him.

865
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,042
I'm blessing him!

866
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:28,667
Did you do that for me, Marino,
for me?

867
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:31,667
Yes, Marisa, my dear, I've been
looking for you for a long time.

868
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:32,333
For me?

869
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,292
I've been going through all the
streets to search for you.

870
01:03:35,917 --> 01:03:39,000
My Marisa, my dear!
- No!

871
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:43,542
I'm not yours.

872
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:45,750
I didn't get it, sorry.

873
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,917
Too late.

874
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:50,375
Too late for what, my love?

875
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:54,125
I'm Miss Ciceri now.

876
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,792
Who's Miss Ciceri?

877
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:02,583
Me.

878
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,875
I got married.

879
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,958
Married?

880
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,708
Well done.

881
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,167
Have you said "married", Marisa?

882
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,500
Tell me it's not true, Marisa.

883
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,583
It's not true, Marisa,
it can't be like that.

884
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:35,625
It can't be that you've become
Miss Ciceri.

885
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,083
It can't be, Marisa.

886
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,792
Hey!
Look, Miss Ciceri has left.

887
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,417
I had told you I was right,
you've been cuckolded!

888
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,167
Being cuckolded is no. 58.

889
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:52,042
If these numbers are drawn,
we shall become rich.

890
01:04:52,042 --> 01:04:54,417
Let's share it, I'll give you
40%.

891
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:58,792
28, 14, 1, and 58, we have
drawn four winning numbers.

892
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:53,333
What are you doing here?

893
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,125
Are you surprised?

894
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,542
It all evens out, my dear.

895
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:02,875
I'm back, rich and ruthless,
like the Count of Monte Cristo!

896
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:03,875
Ready?

897
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:10,792
Ah, your wife!

898
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:13,833
Nice to meet you, you've made
a good bargain!

899
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,042
Are you here to hurt me?
- To hurt you?

900
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,375
A cannonball would be needed!

901
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:28,333
- Can...non...ball.
- Oh, yes! Cool.

902
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:31,708
You've even got sarcastic.
- You think so?

903
01:06:31,792 --> 01:06:33,250
I don't agree.

904
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:37,042
What is he doing?
Is he reassembling it?

905
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:51,333
When an idol, in which you
believe, crumbles...

906
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,875
...what to do?
To cry, maybe?

907
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:57,708
No, just kick the pieces
and laugh!

908
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,958
Bitterly, but laugh at everything.

909
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:05,458
Nice jacket! If he satisfies me,
I'll buy other six of them.

910
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:06,833
Marino, now go away!

911
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:10,750
What is he doing?
Does he actually cook?

912
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:16,000
Mr Ciceri, have I finished
to try on?

913
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,000
Mr Ci...Mr Ci...
may I take off the jack...?

914
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:23,625
What is he meaning with these
moves?

915
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,833
He's not an oaf like you!
He's invited you to lunch,...

916
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,083
...but you say no.
And go away!

917
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,458
Bu..ca..ti..ni.
- What?

918
01:07:32,542 --> 01:07:35,125
Bu..ca..ti..ni!

919
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:39,083
Whatever. I'll gladly accept,
I've a good appetite, anyway, thanks.

920
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,375
Have you gone crazy?
He did it as a compliment.

921
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,667
It's quite a setup you got here,
you've even the cook.

922
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:45,792
Now, Marino, go away,...

923
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:48,000
...get out of this house, or
I'll tell him everything!

924
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,458
Really? How can you tell him!?
By your fingers?

925
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,958
This way?

926
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:53,708
Why?
Did I go with you sometimes?

927
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:55,333
You didn't go with me, but
you could do it!

928
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,250
Because I'm a gentleman and
didn't insist!

929
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,333
You're a coward!
- No, an idiot!

930
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:01,708
Otherwise I wouldn't have thrown
myself in the river for you!

931
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,750
I wish you were died!

932
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,417
Ah, the truth has come out
now, killer!

933
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:08,958
Look at him, you've married
un buffoon, a clown!

934
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,792
A circus clown!
Here's who you've married!

935
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:14,625
You're here to dishonor the
house of an unhappy man,...

936
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:17,167
...to make a mockery of a man
fallen into a serious disgrace,...

937
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:19,708
...who got the hearing and the
voice loss...

938
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:22,542
...during the bombing of San
Lorenzo quarter!

939
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,042
Sorry, but the worst disgrace
where he's fallen in...

940
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:27,667
...is when he married one like you!

941
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:29,667
Say it again!
- Do you think you're scaring me?

942
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:30,750
Ouch!

943
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,083
Come.

944
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,333
Come here, Marisa, why,...
- Let me go!

945
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:36,458
Why are you so perfidious?
- Let me go!

946
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:39,000
No, no, you're mine.
- I never would be yours!

947
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,083
You'll be now!
- I'd rather be dead!

948
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,417
No, I want you to stay alive!

949
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:44,000
I'll call for help!
- Please do it!

950
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Help, Umberto!
- He can't hear you, anyway.

951
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,542
Help!
- Shut up!

952
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:50,458
Shut up, I say!
Come here, Marisa.

953
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:53,750
Marino, you're the devil!
- Yes, I'm.

954
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:57,125
I'm the devil, you've made me
like that, Marisa, you!

955
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,875
If he discovers us, he will kill us!
- We shall die together, then.

956
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:05,958
The scent of your skin drives
me crazy!

957
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:08,917
So you make everything dirty!
- Yes, I want to!

958
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,708
Who's whistling?
- It's him! He's coming!

959
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,500
You've come here to condemn me
to hell.

960
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:07,208
We'll go into the eternal flames,
just like all the sinners.

961
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:08,375
Who cares!

962
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,042
What is he doing now?
Is it the bill?

963
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:41,917
What is it?

964
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:46,000
A game? Is he playing some
trivia? What is it?

965
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:51,458
What is he drawing?
Nick Nack Patty?

966
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,667
Holidays?

967
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:58,458
No, little birds?

968
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,333
- Lit..tle..birds.
- little birds, ah, here we go!

969
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:02,958
What is he doing?

970
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,542
The sun!

971
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,417
Well, sure, it's springtime!

972
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,708
A nice day has come out.
- D..day!

973
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:12,542
Is it a nice day?

974
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:16,250
Ah, and you've made a Michelangelo
painting to say it's a nice day.

975
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,667
Sun..day.
- What's he saying? Translate.

976
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:19,833
Sunday.

977
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:21,667
He says that, if Sunday is
a nice day,...

978
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:24,208
...we shall take a trip, and
he wants you to come too.

979
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:27,000
Say no.
- Yes, I say yes.

980
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,083
I'm coming too.
Where will we go?

981
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:34,083
What? Shall we stay at home?
Ah, no, it's a church.

982
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:36,375
What? Are we going to take
a trip into a church?

983
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:41,083
What's that?
A kettle?

984
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:44,250
No, a crusader, a ghost...
Is it a monk?

985
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:45,958
What is it?
A convent of monks?

986
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,583
Monks?
- He's got an uncle who's a monk.

987
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,292
Ah, we shall go to a convent.

988
01:11:50,417 --> 01:11:52,000
Got it, no need to draw more.

989
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,667
Got it, we shall go to a convent.
C'mon, he's drawing all the monks, oh!

990
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,333
He also drawn the prior.

991
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:02,167
Why shall we go to a convent?
Let's go somewhere else.

992
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:04,417
Cho..cola..te.

993
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:06,125
What?
- Go...od.

994
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,625
They produce chocolate.
- Ah, he's even gluttonous.

995
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,000
It's for me!
He'd do anything for me.

996
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:17,875
How nice he's!
Give me a pencil.

997
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,542
Hey!
I want to make a drawing too.

998
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:25,042
No, I want to see if you understand
that. Just a moment, excuse me.

999
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,667
Here, it's a chef's hat.

1000
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,167
You're a good cook.

1001
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,875
You're a good cook,
you're a good cook.

1002
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:44,208
Can't you hear me?

1003
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,083
You're a good cook.

1004
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,208
Co..ok.
- Cook!

1005
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:54,042
You've prepared a good food,
gut, gut!

1006
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:55,833
Look, he's deaf, not German!

1007
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,167
Ah, yes.

1008
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:00,875
What's he saying?

1009
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,042
What's he saying?

1010
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:05,750
He said you're so nice,
he must be even blind then.

1011
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,250
Well, yes, or he wouldn't have
married you. Thanks!

1012
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:09,958
Thanks.

1013
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:14,042
What's wrong with him?

1014
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:22,667
No, no, I couldn't hear anything.
I didn't hear.

1015
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:28,000
Silence, we have to keep quiet.

1016
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,583
Ah, the nap!
Please go, go and have a nap!

1017
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,583
Go, Mr Ciceri!

1018
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:39,625
Ah, no, I'm going away now!
I have to go.

1019
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,750
In case, I'm staying here just
for a while.

1020
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,458
Listen, Marisa...
- I'm going away too.

1021
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:56,958
Marisa!

1022
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,792
Marisa, get out of this room,
shameless!

1023
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:03,708
Marino, go away, I beg you!

1024
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:07,417
Listen carefully, Marisa,
I have to talk to you alone!

1025
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,000
I'll be waiting for you tonight
at 8 pm,...

1026
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,542
...at the pizza joint at Melozzo
from Forlì street!

1027
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:17,083
I won't come!
- You'll come instead!

1028
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,250
If you don't want me to make
a big deal!

1029
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:25,083
Just remember this name:
Melozzo from Forlì!

1030
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,208
At the corner in Vignola street!

1031
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,542
You've come in the end.

1032
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:57,250
Not for your threat, but just to
say enough and get out of my life.

1033
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:00,083
And, if I get out of your life,...

1034
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:03,500
...what will I be given in exchange?

1035
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,542
Is this a question?

1036
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:09,125
What is it?
An answer?

1037
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:13,500
I mean, is it a question
to get something?

1038
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,000
Indeed.

1039
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:19,667
Marino, let me remember about
you with love.

1040
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,583
You'd know how many times I've been
thinking about you in these months.

1041
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:27,042
I've called you:
Marino, Marino, I want Marino!

1042
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:28,833
Sorry, madam, Marino's over.

1043
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,750
We've got this dry Frascati
wine which is very good.

1044
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,208
No, look, you can't understand.

1045
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:34,500
If you say so.

1046
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:49,917
And, if I give in, will you go
away forever then?

1047
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:52,125
Forever.

1048
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:56,583
My God, if one day you have to
miss me,...

1049
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,958
I...this pizza is nice!

1050
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:01,167
They're serving such a good pizza
here, eat.

1051
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:02,500
Is there a bit of pepper?

1052
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:08,625
Come in.

1053
01:17:18,792 --> 01:17:20,583
My apartment isn't that great,...

1054
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,417
...but it has a cool terrace
over the railway.

1055
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:27,458
A sink is in here.

1056
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:30,458
There's no kitchen, anyway I use
to eat at the train station,...

1057
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:33,000
...where I work as the first barber.

1058
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:37,250
There's a nice bathroom, owned
by the other family, though.

1059
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:40,500
But I can go to whenever I
want.

1060
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:45,292
Nothing is here, anyway there's
my bed at night.

1061
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,333
Will you have a drink?

1062
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,208
Please make yourself comfortable.

1063
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,833
There's a coat rack with three
hooks.

1064
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:01,792
It's so hot today!

1065
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:04,292
Maybe I'd better take this
wool tie off.

1066
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:22,042
You're always very sure of
yourself, aren't you?

1067
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,667
A Carpano or a Punt & Mess?

1068
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:29,792
Nothing.

1069
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:33,625
No, I'd like to have a nip.

1070
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:41,250
Cheers.

1071
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,500
You're cold.

1072
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:20,625
Should I have to be hot?

1073
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,875
No, but the bare minimum,
at least.

1074
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:42,792
Got it.

1075
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,125
Marisa.

1076
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:19,500
Marisa, what's happening in you?

1077
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:24,625
You have wanted only my body,
Marino, you won't have my soul.

1078
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,125
Is the light bothering you?

1079
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,125
Will I lessen it?

1080
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:42,417
Marisa!

1081
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,500
My Marisa.

1082
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,000
Marisa, Marisa.

1083
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:51,208
Marisa...Marisa?

1084
01:20:51,792 --> 01:20:52,875
Marisa?

1085
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,042
Marisa, what's wrong?

1086
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:56,917
Marisa!

1087
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:04,000
Miss Giulia!

1088
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:07,375
Miss Giulia. - Do you have to
go to the bathroom?

1089
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,333
No, thanks. Can I borrow a bit
of vinegar, please?

1090
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,542
Do you have to season some food?
- Yes, thanks.

1091
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:15,542
Here, would you like some salt
as well?

1092
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,667
No, thanks, Miss Giulia,
the vinegar is enough.

1093
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:20,125
Thanks!
- You're welcome, no problem.

1094
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,292
Marisa?

1095
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,500
Marisa, no, that's the oil.

1096
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:32,292
Marisa, what's wrong, my love?

1097
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:35,417
Marisa, don't scare me.
Darling, Marisa.

1098
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:37,542
C'mon, it's nothing, come here.

1099
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:38,750
C'mon, darling, get up.

1100
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,333
Marisa, it's nothing,...

1101
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:50,042
You fainted for a while, it's
nothing, how do you feel?

1102
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,375
Will you drink something or
take your hat off?

1103
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:55,542
No, thanks. - Really?
- I'm feeling better. - Yes.

1104
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:58,333
Perhaps that pizza was bad for
you.

1105
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:02,125
No, forget the pizza...

1106
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:10,542
You were right, I've been wrong.

1107
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,333
The music is over...
the friends go away.

1108
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,833
Alright, Marisa, I'll go away
forever.

1109
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:21,833
Sorry for every mean thing I did
to you and for my cloth.

1110
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I'll be left only with memories,...

1111
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:29,125
...the taste of your kisses,...

1112
01:22:30,167 --> 01:22:31,667
...a record for the summer,...

1113
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:34,583
...our Sundays in Macerata,...

1114
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:39,792
...and the first words you had
with me.

1115
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,458
"Would you like a licorice
chewing gum, miss?"

1116
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:48,292
"No, thanks, it makes my
teeth black."

1117
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:51,542
Marino!

1118
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,500
Are you feeling sick again?

1119
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:15,083
How can I help you?
We have got everything here.

1120
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:19,167
Open this bottle of sparkling wine
and some fried pastries, to start.

1121
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:19,917
Fried pastries?

1122
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:22,458
You don't run away from fried
pastries at carnival.

1123
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:25,917
Fried pastries!
I go and see, but I'm not sure.

1124
01:23:40,417 --> 01:23:42,750
I've heard that you were looking
for fried pastries before.

1125
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,375
I've brought some of them,
can I offer them?

1126
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:47,167
Ah, thanks.
- Thanks, very kind of you.

1127
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:52,333
De Santis Edoardo, I work at Perucchi
typography, right over here.

1128
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,542
And, when I'm on shift,
I come and eat here.

1129
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:55,958
Who would come here otherwise?

1130
01:23:55,958 --> 01:23:58,417
The food here isn't that good,
even at carnival.

1131
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:01,500
Sure that once carnival was
much better.

1132
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,000
But today, it's good that it's
always carnival today, isn't it?

1133
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,875
But you're not listening to me.
You know, when I start to talk...

1134
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,875
Won't you have a fried pastry?

1135
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:12,167
Oh, a fried pastry!
Well, I have to taste it at least.

1136
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:15,542
Are they good, aren't they?
My mom made them.

1137
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:23,958
He's not changed a lot but
looks fine.

1138
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:28,792
May I?

1139
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:30,167
Is it your wife?

1140
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,042
No, it's his wife.

1141
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:33,667
Thanks.

1142
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:54,208
Good.

1143
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,292
You can't hear.

1144
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:25,875
No!

1145
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:34,833
Oh, tango, tango!

1146
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:00,750
Go round, round.

1147
01:26:06,042 --> 01:26:07,292
Let's change!

1148
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:08,958
Move away!

1149
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:31,125
Today you haven't come.
- I couldn't.

1150
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:33,792
Tomorrow?

1151
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:36,750
It's more and more difficult
to find excuses.

1152
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:42,417
I cannot stand this much longer.
- As for me, much less than you.

1153
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:49,208
I'd eat you.
- Ah, please do it!

1154
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,833
Maybe it's the only thing.

1155
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:15,833
What, my love?

1156
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:20,458
The insane gesture.
- C'mon!

1157
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:25,292
What have you understood?
I didn't mean us!

1158
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,250
Who, then?

1159
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:33,958
Him!

1160
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:39,458
Him?
Why? Poor thing.

1161
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:42,583
Poor thing?
He beats me!

1162
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:48,917
Does he beat you?

1163
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:53,083
Has he noticed anything?
- No.

1164
01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:56,417
He's doing terrible things to
me in intimacy!

1165
01:27:57,583 --> 01:27:59,583
Really?
What?

1166
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:06,208
How do they call a man beating
his wife in intimacy?

1167
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,917
Well...nervous.

1168
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,375
Forget nervous, it's a vice,
a perversion.

1169
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:19,292
So he's like a...masochistic.

1170
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:24,208
What? You've been telling he
was a saint, a good egg.

1171
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:27,750
It was a lie.
- A lie?

1172
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:31,458
A merciful lie.

1173
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:38,208
Go figure that deaf!
I can't believe it!

1174
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:47,875
Hence, he's the one of the three
of us who must die. - Shut up!

1175
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:51,208
Marisa, you're scaring me.

1176
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:14,917
A Brancamenta bitter.
- No, my son, why?

1177
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:19,000
You didn't sacrifice her! You read
sentences like that in novels.

1178
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:23,792
A cappuccino.
- Right.

1179
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:26,542
What will I give to the Capuchin?

1180
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:34,125
Sam...bu...
sambuca, ah!

1181
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:40,750
Let's hear, Umberto, go ahead.
Let's hear why?

1182
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:49,750
Alright, let's say that you're
a bit lacking in this.

1183
01:29:50,792 --> 01:29:54,792
Lacking!
- Lac...king.

1184
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:58,333
A marriage is not just these
things.

1185
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:04,292
There's affection, esteem,
esteem!

1186
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:05,542
Este...em.

1187
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:09,500
A pleasure coming from
mutual understanding.

1188
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:12,750
If there's the rest it's better,
if not...

1189
01:30:12,792 --> 01:30:14,208
There's not.

1190
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,833
What the heck are you saying?

1191
01:30:16,292 --> 01:30:17,833
Am I your uncle?
- Yes.

1192
01:30:17,917 --> 01:30:22,542
If I'm not just useful for you
to order a cappuccino,...

1193
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:27,417
...listen what I'm going to tell
you with the greatest belief.

1194
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,333
Marisa cares a lot about you.

1195
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:35,833
Su...re?
- Yes, very sure.

1196
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,875
Ma...ri...no?

1197
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:40,750
Yeah, also Marino cares about
you, of course.

1198
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:45,292
Everyone cares about you,
Umberto, everyone.

1199
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:03,917
Are you sure the iron is always
unplugged when he doesn't use it?

1200
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:06,000
Yes.

1201
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,375
And that he plugs in it only
when he has to iron clothes?

1202
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:35,583
Quick!

1203
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:39,042
I wouldn't like to come back home
late, or Umberto starts to worry.

1204
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:40,000
Here.

1205
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,750
It's simple, even a boy can do it.

1206
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:53,167
Are you sure that it will work?
- What?

1207
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:55,833
Sure that it works, you just need
to stick the electrical wire...

1208
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:59,125
...in the reservoir of the
kerosene heater,...

1209
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:02,125
...and that wire must be connected
to the iron.

1210
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:06,042
So, when he plugs in it...

1211
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:10,417
And what will happen when he plugs
in it? - Nothing.

1212
01:32:10,708 --> 01:32:11,750
And what will happen?

1213
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:13,875
It explodes and everything
blows up.

1214
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:17,833
Will he feel pain?
- No, he won't even notice it.

1215
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:19,833
The instant death is the nicest
one.

1216
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:21,417
I'd like to die like that.

1217
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:26,167
Here, now that the train's passing,
so that the bang will be muffled.

1218
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:27,208
No!

1219
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:29,000
It's just a try.

1220
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,083
I'm scared!

1221
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:32,917
Either we do it or we don't.

1222
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,333
We must be courageous.
- Yes, my love.

1223
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:51,500
Mr Marino, what's happened?

1224
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,875
I've heard a blow!

1225
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:55,083
A blow? Which blow?

1226
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:56,625
I heard nothing!

1227
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,667
Marisa, I can't do it.

1228
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:03,042
When you read this letter,...

1229
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:06,750
...I'll be already on the way
on the bus coming at 12:45 pm.

1230
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:09,458
Leaving each other definitively
is the only solution.

1231
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:11,375
I've realized that our love...

1232
01:33:11,375 --> 01:33:14,417
...was leading us to a bad path
unconsciously,...

1233
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:18,125
...as you can read many times on the
papers about those wicked lovers.

1234
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:22,083
Set this letter on fire, the flame
will burn it like my heart burns for you.

1235
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:24,958
But it's better to put everything out...

1236
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:27,500
Goodbye forever to you, your Marino.

1237
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:30,333
Marino!

1238
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:36,250
Marisa, why are you here?
- Marino!

1239
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,500
Now it's harder.

1240
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,708
I stuck the electrical wire in
the heater.

1241
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:46,417
Has it blown up?
- No, in a short time.

1242
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:49,417
As soon as the hired man goes
away, he starts to iron.

1243
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:55,042
My suitcases...

1244
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:03,792
Marino,...

1245
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:06,500
...I'm afraid.

1246
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:14,042
Mr Umberto,...

1247
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,000
...I'm leaving now.

1248
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:18,917
And don't forget that the band
of The Ghosts...

1249
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:23,083
...phoned to say that they would
come for fitting tomorrow morning.

1250
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:26,708
And don't forget to iron these
ones.

1251
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,458
Quick!

1252
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,333
Look, if they stop me and find out
the trick, I won't account for this!

1253
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:19,833
Run!
It's life or death!

1254
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:23,333
I warn you, if we don't get there
in time, it'll be your responsibility!

1255
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,125
Mine? Can't you see there's
a lot of traffic?

1256
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:28,750
It will take us a hour at least,
if that's enough.

1257
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,875
Go, go, go through any red lights!

1258
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:38,125
No, I won't run that red light.

1259
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:41,958
When I have my license suspended,
will I come and eat at your house?

1260
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:15,667
My wife and me were having...

1261
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:18,958
...a snack while waiting
for the lunch,...

1262
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:24,167
..when we heard a big blow and
the wall of kitchen collapsed.

1263
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:29,042
I was in such underwear and
I found myself in the open.

1264
01:36:29,542 --> 01:36:31,542
Miss Ciceri, something terrible
has happened!

1265
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:33,125
The heater has blown up!

1266
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:34,542
Umberto...

1267
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:37,583
The ambulance has taken him away
just now, that's all I know.

1268
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,958
Miss, they had to get in through
the window.

1269
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:43,500
Well, but I always say that you
can't trust stoves.

1270
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,625
What a blow, oh my, what a disaster!
- Is it you Miss Ciceri?

1271
01:36:47,167 --> 01:36:48,958
Yes, she's the wife.

1272
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:50,250
Come with me.

1273
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,667
You come too.
- Me?

1274
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:53,500
What's up to her?

1275
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,917
Oh my, she's goint to faint.
- C'mon!

1276
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:58,000
C'mon!
- Cheer up!

1277
01:37:22,167 --> 01:37:23,417
Umberto!

1278
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:27,833
Let's go.
- This way, where are you going?

1279
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:39,208
Women from Avana are just like
the nice fleshy flowers,...

1280
01:37:39,292 --> 01:37:43,167
...their blood is as scorching
as Ecuador!

1281
01:37:43,167 --> 01:37:47,333
Flowers as voluptuous as the
Bolivian coke,...

1282
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:51,250
...who of us gets high, will
repeat that forever! - Come in.

1283
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:55,500
Is it here?
- Torture me but kill me with kisses!

1284
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:59,875
A strange suffering is tormenting
my soul!

1285
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:05,250
Creole, with a dark halo, for...
Marisa!

1286
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:06,875
Marino!

1287
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:10,708
You can see it, I just got my
voice back, my voice, my voice!...

1288
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:15,000
It's a miracle by Saint Lorenzo,
Lorenzo, Lorenzo, Lorenzo!....

1289
01:38:15,333 --> 01:38:16,583
But it's Umberto!

1290
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:19,458
Marino!
- Umberto!

1291
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:21,333
Marino!
- Umberto!

1292
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:25,125
Dear Umberto!
- That hurts!

1293
01:38:25,125 --> 01:38:28,375
Nice, it's nice to cry for pain,
to be able to cry!

1294
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:30,667
I got all scorched, but I don't
give a damn about it!

1295
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:32,083
Marisa!

1296
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:34,292
Umberto!

1297
01:38:34,292 --> 01:38:36,417
Well, how strong his Italian is.

1298
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:38,000
Umberto!

1299
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,583
What a wonderful voice you have,
Marisa, I've heard it, you know?

1300
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:43,875
Repeat, repeat, repeat,
repeat, repeat Umberto.

1301
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:45,250
Umberto!
- Easy.

1302
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,500
Umberto.
- Yes!

1303
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:50,000
I can hear you! How nice to hear
people calling me Umberto.

1304
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,208
Dear Umberto, dear Umberto,
dear Umberto!

1305
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:54,750
Blast you!
You gave us all a scare!

1306
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,792
I was scared too!

1307
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:58,292
Let's not think about it anymore.
- Uncle Arduino, come here.

1308
01:38:58,292 --> 01:39:00,917
Uncle Arduino, uncle Arduino,
uncle Arduino!

1309
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:04,875
Ah, the chocolate, the chocolate,
the chocolate, look at the chocolate!

1310
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:07,667
Easy, it's not good for him, ouch!

1311
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:10,208
How big hands you have, how big hands,
how big hands, how big hands you have.

1312
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,042
Give me a little kiss.
- He has such big hands!

1313
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:14,750
Have you heard?
They knocked on the door.

1314
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:17,500
I've heard nothing.
- What? I heard, are you deaf?

1315
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:18,417
Who did knock on the door?

1316
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,292
Ah, my friends deaf and dumb!

1317
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,250
No, what are they doing?

1318
01:39:31,458 --> 01:39:34,625
Please, get out.
You too, please.

1319
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:37,167
Don't make a mess, he must not speak.
- Hello! What you're missing!

1320
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:38,417
C'mon, please.

1321
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:46,167
Dottore, how could miracle
like this happen?

1322
01:39:46,167 --> 01:39:49,500
Madam, the explosion has untied
the traumatic knot which...

1323
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:53,708
...had paralysed the nerve centers
controlling hearing and voice emission.

1324
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:57,167
But it'd be a bit difficult to
explain the whole mechanism.

1325
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:00,667
Are you happy?
- You can't imagine how much.

1326
01:40:10,042 --> 01:40:12,625
I don't know at all if you'll
be so happy, you know?

1327
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:13,792
Why?

1328
01:40:13,792 --> 01:40:15,333
Cut it out, Umberto!

1329
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,292
He's obsessed by an idea.

1330
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,458
It's not an idea...it's a vow.

1331
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:21,500
Which vow?

1332
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,667
I told you we'd talk to the
bishop.

1333
01:40:23,667 --> 01:40:26,417
A vow can be broken.
- I don't want to talk to the bishop!

1334
01:40:26,625 --> 01:40:28,958
My poor mom took this vow
to let me get my voice back.

1335
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:31,625
And she only can break it.
But my mom is dead.

1336
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:33,625
I say that through force of
circumstance...

1337
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:35,292
...any vow can be broken!

1338
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:38,958
Which force of circumstance!
- Please, don't get upset.

1339
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:41,375
Keep calm.
- Calm!

1340
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:44,875
I've been keeping quiet for 25
years, you know! Calm...

1341
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:48,625
I didn't get anything,
but, if he took a vow...

1342
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,042
...well, it's a vow.

1343
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,417
Which vow is?

1344
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:01,667
Where is he?
- Here he is.

1345
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:05,083
Umberto!
- Now he's Brother Lorenzo.

1346
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:07,625
Right, Brother Lorenzo!

1347
01:41:08,542 --> 01:41:09,833
Brother Lorenzo,...

1348
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:12,042
...how are you?

1349
01:41:12,375 --> 01:41:14,083
We're here to see you.

1350
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:16,875
He can't speak.

1351
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:20,208
What? Just now that he got his
voice back?

1352
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:22,500
They're doing their spiritual
retreat.

1353
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,000
Ah, only for today.

1354
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,042
No, all their life long.
- All their life long?

1355
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:44,833
What has he said?

1356
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:46,542
What's he saying?

1357
01:41:47,208 --> 01:41:52,292
I'm glad you're going to marry
