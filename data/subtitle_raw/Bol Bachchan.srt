1
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,776
Your Honor, these people are lying.

2
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,949
l swear on the Bhagawad Gita.

3
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,485
This is the first dialogue
of the play, but where is the Gita?

4
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,819
And what about the portrait
of Gandhi behind that chair?

5
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,887
Sorry, ma'am, l forgot.
l'll get it done.

6
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,564
How much longer do l wait,
Madam Art Director?

7
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,993
Here you are trying to
set up this court while...

8
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,661
tomorrow is the hearing
at the actual court!

9
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,974
Where is your brother Abbas?

10
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,644
Sir...

11
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,814
you know how much l've
struggled to pay the legal fees.

12
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,782
Trying to keep up with this
case for the last three years...

13
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,192
l was forced to sell my taxi.

14
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,532
And now he is driving the
taxi for the people who bought it!

15
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,164
Sir, after our
father passed away...

16
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,206
...his elder brother
seized our land illegally.

17
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,670
Now he wants the
house that we live in.

18
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,539
lf we win this case,
the house will remain ours and...

19
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,813
we will be close to
our father's memories.

20
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,952
Yes, sir.

21
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:41,678
Please.

22
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,685
Tomorrow the ruling
should be in our favor.

23
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,086
Don't worry, Abbas.

24
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,290
Tomorrow in the court,
the ball will be in our court!

25
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,594
We will win.

26
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,722
But you've been assuring
us for the past three years!

27
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,833
This isn't an assurance,
it's a guarantee, Sania.

28
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,764
Abbas, l've worked the
case in such a manner that...

29
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,563
...the accused will also
pay compensation...

30
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,073
...for the mental harassment
they've caused us.

31
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:02,967
Really?

32
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,102
Yes, the judge will be
so impressed with my plea that...

33
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,974
before he can pass
the judgment he will say...

34
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,807
l am shocked!

35
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,819
The arguments and evidence
presented by Abbas Ali's lawyer...

36
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,013
clearly state that the disputed
property doesn't belong to...

37
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,346
Abbas Ali.

38
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,594
The rightful owner of
the property is Ashfaq Ali.

39
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:28,131
Now he can sue Abbas
Ali for mental harassment.

40
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,626
Case is dismissed!

41
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,069
Hey wait...

42
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,073
where are you running?

43
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,301
Come here!

44
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,936
You've ruined me!

45
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,571
- Abbas, l'm your lawyer.
- Lawyer?

46
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,375
You're the last nail in the coffin!

47
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,045
We'll appeal the case higher...

48
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,844
l'll send you higher!

49
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,315
Abbas!

50
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,386
Abbas!

51
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,622
You went overboard, Abbas!

52
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,269
You beat up your lawyer
outside the court!

53
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:09,206
Thankfully Sania called
me and l posted your bail.

54
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,676
Before doing something like that,
didn't you think about your sister?

55
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,340
Uncle, l did think about Sania and
that's why l merely beat him up.

56
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,346
Otherwise l would've smashed
him with the judge's gavel!

57
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,049
Abbas, l agree we've
been deceived...

58
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,616
but that doesn't mean
you go on a killing spree.

59
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,884
What do you want me to do, Sania?

60
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,390
What do l do?

61
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,018
We've lost father's house.

62
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,658
The taxi owner has refused
me from driving his taxi.

63
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,788
He says l'm a convict.

64
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,421
ln such a situation one
is bound to lose control.

65
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,156
Take it easy, Abbas.

66
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,731
Take it easy.

67
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,031
Sania, get him some tea.

68
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,829
Go get some tea.

69
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,742
Now l've realised why the
Taj Mahal is called a 'wonder'.

70
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,442
What do you mean?

71
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,817
Shah Jahan built the
Taj Mahal without a bank loan.

72
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,727
A wonder!

73
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:07,131
The middle class person
has such basic desires.

74
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,433
A six figure salary,
five working days...

75
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,268
a four wheeler...

76
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,272
a three bedroom apartment...

77
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,773
two kids and a life partner.

78
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,770
But the fact is...

79
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,347
the heaviest burden a man
can have is his empty pocket.

80
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,487
Abbas!

81
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,889
You value the good times only
after going through tough times.

82
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,057
Thank you, uncle.

83
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,101
For confirming that l
am going through tough times.

84
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,028
lt's good to understand
your predicament but...

85
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,840
it's foolish to cry over it.

86
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,937
Listen, you and Sania should
come with me to Ranakpur.

87
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,506
Ranakpur?

88
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,440
Yes!

89
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,378
Your father and l
weren't merely friends.

90
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,748
We were more like brothers.

91
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,157
Now, you will do as l say.

92
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,287
lf you stay back here...

93
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,385
...you'll see your cousins
everyday and curse your life.

94
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,997
l will try my best to get
you ajob at the place l'm working.

95
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,166
Ranakpur is an amazing place.

96
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,267
There's no politics there,
and no mad rush like the city.

97
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,773
lt's peaceful everywhere you go.

98
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,007
Happiness...

99
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,448
Serene and calm...

100
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,948
Help!

101
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,610
l've been working for the
Raghuvanshi family since 30 years.

102
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,609
Earlier l worked for the father
and now for his son, Prithviraj.

103
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,314
Prithviraj is a great human being.

104
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,683
He is passionate about two things.

105
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,858
First...

106
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,831
And the second is...

107
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,165
to speak English better
than the English themselves!

108
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,003
'Early to double bed
and early to wake up fast...

109
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,709
makes a male healthy,
strong and oversmart!'

110
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,346
'Eat lots and lots of walnuts,
tighten your loincloth...

111
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,240
and fight with bare hands,
no knives, no forks!'

112
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,150
Even more than the
English language...

113
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,155
he loves his sister,
Radhika, very much.

114
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,323
Right now Radhika is studying
in a Delhi university.

115
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,797
But when it comes to the prosperity
and progress of Ranakpur...

116
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,930
Prithviraj is always
at the forefront!

117
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:01,400
This year he will also begin
work on the Deteron power plant.

118
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,366
But every now and then the power
plant project is disrupted...

119
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,742
...by his cousin, Vikrant.

120
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,382
And that adds fuel to
their decade's old family feud.

121
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,155
Vikrant is against both
Prithviraj and the power project.

122
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,820
Prithviraj seems like
an honest and righteous man.

123
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,861
l think your decision to get Abbas
ajob here is absolutely right.

124
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,263
Prithviraj hates one thing though.

125
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,461
What?

126
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,168
Lies.

127
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,430
How do you feel?

128
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,199
Doctor, l'm in a lot of pain.

129
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,341
Have some water.

130
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:40,910
Thank you!

131
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,344
Save me!

132
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,938
Not, 'save me'.
'saved... saved.'

133
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,209
He brought you here.

134
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,318
Tell me something...

135
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,875
who is the monster
that did this to you?

136
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,045
l did.

137
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,823
l beat him up.

138
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,217
You beat him up
and then got him here?

139
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,351
There was a lot of dirt in him.

140
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,089
lt was necessary to get it out.

141
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,128
As for bringing him here,
its compassion.

142
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,490
But what did he do?

143
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,996
What did he do?

144
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:05,967
Fraud!

145
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:11,774
Though he was the supervisor,
he embezzled 99 Rupees.

146
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,237
Just 99 Rupees?

147
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,109
lt's not about 99 Rupees!

148
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,513
The thing is he lied!

149
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,947
Prithviraj Raghuvanshi
worships the truth.

150
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,980
And buries the one who lies.

151
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,391
Everyways, doctor...

152
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,163
be it sunrise or sunfall,
five star backhand service.

153
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,300
Nurse, keep window shopping open,
let atmosphere come in.

154
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,293
Maakhan!

155
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,131
Sir?

156
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,069
Bring freshful flowers
and fruitables.

157
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,164
lmpossible!

158
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,867
Rest in peace!

159
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,403
Listen!

160
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,445
Sir?

161
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,282
Next time you lie...

162
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,341
you can let go of the reward...

163
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,017
because l'll do the deed.

164
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,853
- Maakhan!
- Sir?

165
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,453
Get someone else in his place.

166
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,253
That idiot,
Ravi, he is late yet again.

167
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,431
He isn't a son, but a curse.

168
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,060
He is reason for my ill-health!

169
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,827
Uncle, l'm sure there's
a reason for him being late.

170
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:12,962
There is only one reason!

171
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,302
His third-class
Aflatoon drama company.

172
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:18,932
Come on fast.

173
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,636
There he is.

174
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:21,807
Abbas!

175
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,869
Sania!

176
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,679
My friend Abbas!
You are finally here!

177
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,579
- Hi, welcome Sania.
- Thank you.

178
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,383
Well, l've visited you
a lot in Delhi and so...

179
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:37,658
we welcome you on your
first visit to Ranakpur.

180
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,823
The thing is we didn't even change
our costumes to come and see you...

181
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,765
But you are still late!

182
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,235
l've been standing
here because of you!

183
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,603
You aren't the proverbial
coin to stand on its side.

184
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,331
You could've sat on the bench,
Shastri.

185
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,341
Shastri?

186
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,870
Show some respect!

187
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,707
At least honor the
character of Lord Ram!

188
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,241
Calling your father by his name!

189
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,716
lt depends on who the father is!

190
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,315
You can't compare King
Dashrath with Shastri.

191
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,221
- Ravi!
- Shastri!

192
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,814
- Take the luggage!
- Okay.

193
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,957
Drama company, come on!

194
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,288
Your drama company
really is Aflatoon!

195
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,329
A play in every village?

196
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,865
Dude, we are vagabonds.

197
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,964
And vagabonds do their own thing.

198
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,732
l only want half a cup.

199
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,802
Shastri!

200
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,804
The cup will be full, but
fill it only half with tea, Sania.

201
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,299
That's nice. Very good.

202
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,805
Sania, l was thinking,
now that you are here...

203
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,882
why don't you decorate the stage
for the Aflatoon drama company?

204
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,712
We won't get a better
art director than you.

205
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,218
What do you say, Abbas?

206
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,115
Great!

207
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,154
Finally someone wise
in this bunch ofjokers!

208
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,088
- Shastri!
- Ravi!

209
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,123
Hey... hold on!

210
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,121
At least tell me what
is the theme of your play?

211
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,255
l'll have to think
along those lines.

212
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:50,801
Sania, people get inspired
by plays and make films.

213
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:55,238
But for the first time l've written
this play inspired by films.

214
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,274
Really? What is
the name of your play?

215
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,472
Golmaal!

216
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,368
Brilliant!

217
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,347
What else can be expected
from idiots like you!

218
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,211
Useless!

219
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,248
Golmaal!

220
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,479
Golmaal!

221
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,852
All day this old man
keeps talking nonsense.

222
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,354
We can't even rehearse
over here because of him.

223
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,222
Why not?

224
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,818
The old man is home!

225
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,089
- Shastri!
- Ravi!

226
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,791
- Shastri!
- Ravi!

227
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,035
Wait a minute!

228
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,338
You are Shastri and he is Ravi.

229
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,867
- Yes.
- Right.

230
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,902
lf not here,
then where do you rehearse?

231
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,711
Sir!

232
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,345
My father used to say that...

233
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,044
a man should respect
his values and his moustache.

234
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,047
Moustache is the mirror
of human soul and mind, sir.

235
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,016
Moustache is the
mirror of the mind, sir?

236
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,150
lmpressive!

237
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,886
Your father has such
remarkable thinking.

238
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,958
What you've said is priceless!

239
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,263
A man who has no moustache,
has no mind!

240
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,102
By the way, where is your father?

241
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:05,308
Sir, my father passed
away four years ago.

242
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,709
That's good.

243
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:07,774
Oops!

244
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,913
Cut! Cut!

245
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,245
Blackout!

246
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,213
Next scene!

247
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,912
Wow! Such great acting!

248
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,014
Your play is a superhit!

249
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,112
Thank you, Abbas!

250
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,289
Abbas...

251
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,985
l want you to pray that...

252
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,492
just as my first play,
Alibaba and the 15 Thieves...

253
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,227
even this play is a success.

254
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,691
15 Thieves?

255
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,323
Didn't Alibaba have 40 Thieves?

256
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,130
We enact this in villages
and budgets are an issue.

257
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,172
Therefore,
Alibaba and the 15 Thieves!

258
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:36,802
- Ravi...
- Yes?

259
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,342
l've a list of things l would need.

260
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,340
Very good.

261
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,507
Kailash... Lucky...

262
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,076
take Sania along to Pichku's store.

263
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,410
And buy everything on credit, okay?

264
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,183
Budget is a major problem.

265
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,516
Chintu, get down or you might fall.

266
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,117
Ravi, please tell him.

267
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,290
Chintu... Chintu...

268
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,723
What are you doing up there?

269
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,231
Get down! You might fall.

270
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,324
- Ravi...
- Yes?

271
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,268
Why is that temple
over there locked?

272
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,271
Abbas, this temple stands on the
border of Ranakpur and Kherwada.

273
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,033
This is the result of hostility
between the two villages.

274
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,977
A 'no entry' sign
at the temple door.

275
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,378
Chintu!

276
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:20,949
Chintu!

277
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,286
Someone save my son.

278
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,927
Someone save my son.

279
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,363
My son... he can't swim!

280
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,925
My son!

281
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,270
What do you think you're doing?
Have you lost it?

282
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,635
You'll get into trouble,
if you step into the temple.

283
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,638
Let's go away from here.

284
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,381
My son...

285
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,680
Thank you so much!
You saved my son.

286
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:28,648
Abbas!

287
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,685
What did you do?

288
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,616
You broke the temple lock?

289
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,824
That kid would've drowned!

290
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,653
But still...

291
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,967
Let's get away from here.

292
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:45,765
Wait!

293
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,337
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Mister... listen to me.

294
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,931
- Where are you from?
- Just listen to me.

295
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,538
Let me explain.

296
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,506
Hey... listen...

297
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,876
You are beyond my thoughts,
Vikrant!

298
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,672
At the slightest provocation
you erupt like a volcano.

299
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:03,608
Cousin!

300
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,671
Don't get into this.

301
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,747
For years this matter has been
a bone of contention between us.

302
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,717
Vikrant!

303
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,286
You're shooting in broad daylight!

304
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,055
We've already warned
you about this.

305
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,227
We can arrest you for this conduct.

306
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,293
- But this guy broke the...
- SP Sir...

307
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,923
he broke the temple lock
in order to save the boy's life.

308
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,029
l believe this is
the will of the Almighty.

309
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,298
lf we lock the temple once again...

310
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,340
we will go against
religious traditions...

311
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,669
it will be inauspicious.

312
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,107
What are you trying to say, pandit?

313
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,872
Now that the temple is open,
it will remain so.

314
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,640
l will get the permission
from the Collector.

315
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,950
lf any of you object to this
decision, you will be arrested!

316
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,111
l don't accept this!

317
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,313
SP Sir...
the temple will remain open.

318
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,017
l take responsibility for this.

319
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,459
And if anybody objects...

320
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,720
l will remind him of his childhood.

321
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,734
'l will make him remember
milk number six!'

322
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,170
Come on!

323
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,310
Hail Prithviraj Raghuvanshi!

324
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,128
l haven't seen you before.

325
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,957
Sir, he is my friend's son.

326
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,466
He's from Chandni Chowk, Delhi.

327
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,068
Name?

328
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,033
- Abb...
- Abhishek Bachchan!

329
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,178
His name is Abhishek Bachchan.

330
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:44,847
What?

331
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,421
Pandit...

332
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,330
Abhishek Bachchan?

333
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,875
What else should l've said?

334
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,269
Abbas Ali?

335
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,869
lf the villagers would find out...

336
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,413
...that an Abbas Ali broke
the temple lock...

337
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,340
we would be halfway
across the village by now.

338
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,111
But why Abhishek Bachchan?

339
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,821
The christening of a child
doesn't mean you name him Christ.

340
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,822
lf Prithvirajji finds
out about this lie...

341
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,051
Shastri!

342
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,359
Abhishek Bachchan...

343
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,029
come with me to the mansion.

344
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,068
- Shastri...
- Sir?

345
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,573
isn't he the same guy
who was looking for work?

346
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,002
Yes, sir.

347
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,108
But didn't you mention
some other name?

348
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,806
Well... sir...

349
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,308
Who gave you this name?

350
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,245
His father, sir.

351
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,089
Right?

352
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,822
But why Abhishek Bachchan?

353
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,517
Why not Sachin Tendulkar?

354
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,164
Because at his birth
he was taller than Tendulkar!

355
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,301
l'm kidding, Prithviji.

356
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:49,933
Don't be nervous, Abhishek.

357
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,236
He is like family.

358
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,240
Tell him about your name.

359
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,270
Please!

360
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,244
Speak.

361
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,303
Prithviji...

362
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:02,648
my father and mother were
both fans of Amitabh Bachchan.

363
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:03,743
Right!

364
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:04,582
So?

365
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:08,688
So...

366
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:14,127
my mother and father first
met each other at a theatre.

367
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,099
They were there to watch 'Deewar'.

368
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,928
During the interval,
they saw each other.

369
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,866
The wall fell apart
and they fell in love.

370
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,168
Then?

371
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,300
Then...

372
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:24,901
Then...

373
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,910
Don't be shy... Say it.

374
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,878
Then...

375
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,008
And then...

376
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,343
they sneaked out to
watch a film together...

377
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,845
and the film they saw was...

378
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,078
- 'Chupke Chupke.'
- Yes, 'Chupke Chupke!'

379
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,256
And the day they decided
to get married...

380
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,951
that was the day
'Kasme Waade' released.

381
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,758
The day of their marriage,
'Suhaag' was out.

382
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,918
And when mother conveyed
the good news...

383
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,588
...to father that
she was expecting...

384
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,059
that's the day 'Parvarish'
hit the theatres.

385
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,700
And the day l hit the world...

386
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,702
l mean, the day l was born...

387
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,635
...was the day
'Muqaddar Ka Sikandar' released.

388
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:57,163
And that's why Prithviji, my father,
just like Mr. Amitabh Bachchan...

389
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,106
kept his son's name,
l mean, my name Abhishek Bachchan!

390
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,988
lt's a good thing, your parents
weren't fans of Amjad Khan.

391
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,285
Or they would've
named you Gabbar Singh!

392
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:23,764
Your qualifications?

393
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,263
Jama lslamiya University...

394
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,667
opposite that is
Pandit Nehru College.

395
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,036
l have done my BA there.

396
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,407
Yes, Prithviji. AB has done his BA.

397
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,907
Sir, BA.

398
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,441
He knows two alphabets
that too in reverse, BA!

399
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:41,781
Maakhan!

400
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:42,885
Sir?

401
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,052
Give him superman's post.

402
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,725
- Superman?
- He means supervisor.

403
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,883
A salary of 30,000 Rupees.

404
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,026
30,000?

405
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,263
35,000!

406
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,764
Not a rupee more!

407
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,126
Hail Prithviraj!

408
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,466
Thank you Prithviji.

409
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,866
Even though l don't have
any experience, you gave me ajob.

410
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,442
All due to his...

411
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,007
30 years of special appearances!

412
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,814
He has recommended you.

413
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,149
Happy?

414
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,185
Sir, the fact is...

415
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,719
Prithviji, he wants to say that...

416
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,761
l won't give you any
reason to complain, because...

417
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,355
my father would say,
hard work has its own reward.

418
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,060
Hard work is...

419
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,535
Hard work is the
keyhole to saxophone!

420
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,939
What did you tell me?

421
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,908
The Almighty has locked
both your home and your fate!

422
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,072
And what did you do?

423
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,651
Here you broke the
lock of a religious place!

424
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,145
Oh God!

425
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,322
Fine, even if you broke it.

426
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,917
But you gave him a fake name!

427
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,923
And even if you did,
you used Abhishek Bachchan!

428
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,631
Abhishek Bachchan!

429
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,729
- When the truth is revealed...
- How will the truth be revelaed?

430
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,127
None of us will open our mouth.

431
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,701
And nobody here knows him.

432
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,667
Abbas...

433
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,033
Uncle said that the
previous supervisor...

434
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,336
...is still in the
lCU for telling a lie.

435
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,200
Abbas...

436
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,737
My advice is you quit this job.

437
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,743
You want me to give
up ajob that pays 35,000??

438
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,009
But Abbas...

439
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,142
Uncle, this job is
very important for me.

440
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,084
How long do you expect
me to live with you?

441
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,015
Once l've saved enough,
l can go back to Delhi with Sania.

442
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,226
And start some business.

443
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:34,688
Abbas, your intention is
sincere but its foundation is lies.

444
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,033
Sania...

445
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,606
l'll neither be Abbas
nor Abhishek Bachchan.

446
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,275
l'm a human being...

447
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,669
l'll work like a man.

448
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,179
And if l work with honor...

449
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,911
neither will Allah take offence...

450
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,119
...nor will Lord Ram.

451
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,362
So, Ram Prasad...

452
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,362
What is your experience?

453
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,604
Prior to this,
l have worked at 12 places.

454
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,364
12 places? Great!

455
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,200
l think your compliment is doomed.

456
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,838
lt's possible that he
was fired from 12 places.

457
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,244
l wasn't fired, Prithviji.
ln fact, l quit.

458
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,010
Wow, Ram Prasad!

459
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,879
Your ideals seem to be coated with
an old song and a sweet melody.

460
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:35,754
As you live these words, l suggest
you come by the mansion sometime.

461
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,688
Abhishek, what are you
doing here at this hour?

462
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,362
The accounts were off by a rupee.

463
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,698
Just a rupee.

464
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,000
Prithviji, my father would say...

465
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,740
when you're gifting someone cash,
a round 100 means nothing.

466
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,001
lt has to be, 101.

467
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,670
Your father is 101%  right!

468
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,341
Every penny discounts!

469
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,879
- Where is...
- Penny?

470
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,377
Your father?

471
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,183
He isn't alive.

472
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,117
l have a younger sister at home.

473
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,723
Sania! Help!

474
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,791
Sania, they are beating me up!

475
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,295
You expect us to praise you?

476
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,760
The dialogue is, 'l've
had the salt in your house...'

477
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,391
And he says, 'l've had
the toothpaste in your house.'

478
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,368
Well, there is salt
in the toothpaste!

479
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,802
No wonder you were beaten up,
Vidyasagar!

480
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,872
You turned an emotional
scene into a comedy!

481
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,472
Here, l'll show how it's done.

482
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,810
'Brother,
is it correct to betray...

483
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,077
...the one who has
trusted us completely?'

484
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,949
Go... l'm sure your
sister is waiting for you.

485
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,121
- Yes, go!
- Good night, Prithviji.

486
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,059
'Brother, when he has
kept us close to his heart...

487
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,457
is it right to play
with his emotions?'

488
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,891
Have you ever seen a real gem?

489
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,395
Of course, lots of times.

490
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,530
The one in your ring!

491
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,963
l wasn't talking about this.

492
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,636
Abhishek... a real gem.

493
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,101
Sania, you're the
real gem in our play!

494
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,904
No matter how much Vidyasagar
dives into this role...

495
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,705
he can never play a girl.

496
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,004
You should be the heroine!

497
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:04,571
Me?

498
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,048
- Sania, please!
- No, no...

499
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:06,981
Please!

500
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,109
Me? No way!

501
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,653
We are begging you,
please be the heroine.

502
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,947
Please!

503
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:12,980
Okay!

504
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,456
- Okay!
- Okay!

505
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,159
What's wrong, Shastri?

506
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,758
You look worried.

507
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,596
The month of Ramzan
has just begun.

508
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,071
According to me,
two things are certain.

509
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,532
Either you will be caught...
or you will be caught!

510
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,139
lf we are caught
we'll tell Prithviji.

511
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,105
What?

512
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,182
That there's 'Ram' in
Ramzan and 'Ali' in Diwali!

513
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,062
What are you looking at, Abbas?

514
00:33:54,866 --> 00:34:00,099
Ravi, l hope l didn't make a mistake
by breaking the temple lock.

515
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,698
Of course not, Abbas!

516
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,468
You broke the temple
lock to save a child.

517
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,477
What could be more right?

518
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,146
You remember what you had said...

519
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,177
neither will Allah take offence,
nor will Lord Ram.

520
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,615
Take a look, Abbas...

521
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,487
Your honesty has
triumphed over our lie.

522
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,800
Abhishek...

523
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,509
tomorrow you're coming
with me to Delhi.

524
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,843
Radhika's vacation starts tomorrow.

525
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,512
My sister...

526
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,883
it's her birthday.
We'll bring her home.

527
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,021
Delhi?

528
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,152
Happy birthday, Radhika.

529
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,157
Hey... no, no!

530
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,133
lt's your birthday,
Radhika and make up is important!

531
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,794
No! Please!

532
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,071
Brother!

533
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,173
Pineapple Cake!

534
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,007
English is a very funny language,
Abhishek!

535
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,217
No pine,
no apple, yet its pineapple!

536
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,080
Brother, what did you do?

537
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,586
These days a little bit
of cake is applied on the face.

538
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,753
And l applied his face to the cake!

539
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,154
Hey village landlord!

540
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,090
Without any warning,
all of a sudden...

541
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,625
how can you shove
my face in the cake?

542
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,789
You have a point.
Let's make an announcement.

543
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,298
We request the people at the party
to step back a few steps because...

544
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,600
we're shoving his face
in the cake once more.

545
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,297
Come...

546
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,166
What the hell, Radhika!

547
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,234
Brother, who is this
new goon you've brought along?

548
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,107
Goon?

549
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,910
Thank you very much, Brother.

550
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,278
By humiliating my friends you've
given me the perfect birthday gift!

551
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,111
The party is over!

552
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,125
Radhika,
sir's birthday gift to you.

553
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,059
Car for the lady!

554
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,153
Radhika...

555
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,795
Happy birthright to you!

556
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,333
Color, dark Red lndian.

557
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,304
For safety, air balloon.

558
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,832
The plate with the hole...

559
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,602
CD... 6-CD changer.

560
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,268
Yes!

561
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,907
Central jail locking system and...

562
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,310
on the passenger seat,
a stud like me!

563
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:24,711
- Abhishek!
- Yes?

564
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:25,714
Take her for merry go round!

565
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:26,249
Yes.

566
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,316
Wait a minute, Brother!

567
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,648
Whose birthday is it?

568
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:29,616
Yours.

569
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:30,683
Whose gift is it?

570
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,277
Yours.

571
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,253
Then why will he drive the car?

572
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,253
Such temper, sir.

573
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,187
She's taken after you.

574
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,072
Prithviji, it has been
a while since Radhikaji left.

575
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,416
Hello...
Radhika... this is Maakhan...

576
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,382
What?

577
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,680
Okay, alright.

578
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,860
The hunter searches high and low,
while the prey is right at home!

579
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,692
Radhika gave us the slip
and is headed to Ranakpur.

580
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,799
But on the way to Ranakpur
is Vikrant's village, Kherwada!

581
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,670
l've been trying to call
you but you were not answering!

582
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,614
Brother, l have a flat tyre.

583
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,215
Why did you have
to take off on your own?

584
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,476
Where are you now?

585
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,210
About two miles from Kherwada.

586
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,586
And there's no one
here to ask for help.

587
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,153
Stay right there! We're on the way.

588
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,721
But by the time you get here...

589
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,196
Vikrant!

590
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,162
- Maakhan!
- Sir?

591
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,233
Bring Sabu and the
others to Kherwada!

592
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,705
- Yes, sir.
- you too, Abhishek.

593
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,672
Prithviji, l'll come with you.

594
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,509
Try to understand my problem,
cousin.

595
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,687
l have nothing against you...

596
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:17,121
but how else do l take
my revenge with Prithvi?

597
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,126
Right from the power plant,
to the landlords, the temple...

598
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:21,997
he keeps getting in my way.

599
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:28,603
lt's unfortunate that you
are entangled in our differences.

600
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,849
Finally, my cousin who has always
been distant, has come close to me.

601
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,903
Abhishek...

602
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,012
you can still walk away from here.

603
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,976
Prithviji, l'm working for you.

604
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:21,650
What good am l to you, if l
can't be of use at the right time?

605
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,254
Prithvi is finally
here in Kherwada!

606
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,230
Love for a sister forced
you to make a mistake.

607
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,968
My army surrounds you, Prithvi.
My army!

608
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,158
Vikrant...

609
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:38,634
a tiger always hunts
for a flock of sheep!

610
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:36,969
Sabu!

611
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,913
l can't stoop as low as you,
Vikrant.

612
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,652
l don't look for profit in
a relationship, l care about value.

613
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,146
But mark my words...

614
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,491
if you ever repeat this mistake...

615
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,621
l will send you right to hell.

616
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,902
Now do you realize why l
don't let you go out on your own?

617
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,464
Though they are blood relatives,
they thirst for our blood!

618
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,600
Brother, given that there
are so many problems here...

619
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,009
why don't we move out of Ranakpur?

620
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,445
Every citizen of Ranakpur
is very dear to me.

621
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,746
Their hopes rest with me.

622
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,582
And all l know is this...

623
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,115
you may break a relationship...

624
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,917
but never break someone's trust.

625
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,158
Next time inform
me before you leave.

626
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,760
Sabu, set the table.

627
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,799
Yes, sir.

628
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,036
Prithviji,
we'll take your leave now.

629
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,101
Goodbye, sir.

630
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:37,503
Listen...

631
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,108
today you proved that...

632
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,246
not only are you honest,
but you are brave too.

633
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,219
Come and have lunch with me.

634
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,017
No, Prithviji, l'm fasting...

635
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:53,720
today.

636
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,652
Today l've decided
to observe a fast.

637
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,060
See you.

638
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,797
Listen...

639
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,529
Yes?

640
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,001
A fast on Wednesday?

641
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:16,036
Prithviji, Tuesday or Wednesday,
it makes no difference to a mother.

642
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,874
l'm observing this fast
especially for my mother.

643
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,581
Wait a minute.

644
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,754
You said you had
only a sister at home.

645
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,123
Now where did this
mother come from?

646
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,058
You mean, only you have a mother?

647
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,685
You think l came out of an egg?

648
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,790
Prithviji, the thing
is my sister was at home...

649
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,696
...but my mother
returned yesterday.

650
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:37,992
Returned from where?

651
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,191
- Kaashi.
- Kaashi.

652
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:39,927
Kaashi?

653
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,937
And she is suffering
from a bad cold.

654
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:46,006
So, l decided that until 'ammi'...

655
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:51,104
'Mummy' gets well,
l'll observe a fast everyday!

656
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:53,850
Listen...

657
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,549
Even l will observe
a fast for your mother.

658
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,283
You can't be serious!

659
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,851
You're doing such a
great thing for my mother...

660
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,960
That's nothing. Tomorrow
l will also come to your place.

661
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:04,652
No!

662
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:05,752
- Yes!
- Why?

663
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:09,990
Why not!

664
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,062
But why, Prithviji?

665
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,794
To break the fast in
your mother's presence.

666
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:14,860
What the...

667
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:15,869
What?

668
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,640
My mother and sister
will be very happy.

669
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,868
l said they will be very happy.

670
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,040
lt will make me happy too.

671
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,578
l will also be happy.

672
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,838
The thing is,
sir has seen his mother...

673
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,382
...but never had
a mother's affection.

674
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,175
Maakhan!

675
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:28,946
Got it.

676
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,284
See you.

677
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,216
Yes, Prithviji?

678
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:35,722
l didn't say, 'listen'.

679
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,018
l think you're ears are ringing.

680
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,595
'Your eardrums are playing drums!'

681
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,898
Now there will be
more bells ringing!

682
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,038
Meet your mother!

683
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,111
How will they meet your mother?

684
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,648
lf there were a mother.

685
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:00,948
But where is the mother?

686
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:01,780
Meet your mother!

687
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,614
l think, with the stress about
a mother, my father will pass away.

688
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:06,313
Look!

689
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,621
Don't we have a fake
mother in our plays?

690
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,818
Abbas, a fake mother.

691
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:12,691
What?

692
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,620
A mother and that too, fake?

693
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,728
But where do we get a fake mother?

694
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,300
Right...

695
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,699
We even get Vidyasagar
to play female characters.

696
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,739
He may pass off as a mother but...

697
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,399
l won't pass off as his son.

698
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,976
Abbas, Sania...

699
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,905
l have a mother!

700
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,242
There you go again!
Enough with the dialogues.

701
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,718
l'm not delivering dialogues.
lt's the truth.

702
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,048
l have a mother!

703
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,894
There are thousands mesmerized
by the magic in my eyes!

704
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,267
There might be a thousand
desirable places in this world.

705
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:56,432
There are a thousand
admirers of this courtesan!

706
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,842
Over there, Abbas.

707
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,779
Your future mother.

708
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,481
- Her?
- Yes.

709
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:14,422
Try to drink this
passion from my eyes.

710
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:20,825
What's in a heart,
you can even take my life!

711
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,360
Zohra, you're the
chick in my roost and...

712
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,835
l'm the rooster
that's hungry for you!

713
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,602
l want a mother, Ravi.

714
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,368
What if she begins to
dance in Prithviji's presence?

715
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,839
She is an actor!

716
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,406
And actors are like water.

717
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,707
They take shape of any mould.

718
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,548
And listen to her talk,
such sweet words.

719
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:49,789
Who is this new visitor
in my pavilion of youth?

720
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,658
Probably the scrap dealer,
who likes old stuff.

721
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,793
You cheap good-for-nothing!

722
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,531
You're the dirt of humanity,
the worm from hell.

723
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,467
l'll show you!

724
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,835
We'll get Vidyasagar
to write her dialogues.

725
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,532
How dare you call a
young maiden an old woman?

726
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,668
Wicked man!

727
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,403
You're old, your family is old,
and your son is also old!

728
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,780
You perverted rooster!
Worm from the sewer!

729
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:20,585
l'll place hot coal
on your wild tongue!

730
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,592
You're a torn shoe!

731
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,820
l'll hit you with my sandals!

732
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,661
lt's better to be an orphan
than have a mother like her!

733
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,358
- Let's go.
- No, think about it, Abbas.

734
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,934
A mother for four minutes
or a salary of 35,000??

735
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,430
Sister's responsibility
or ajobless misery?

736
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,808
Mother's veil or Prithviji's belt?

737
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:41,875
Mother!

738
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,039
Tell me quickly,
what is it you want from me?

739
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,584
Actually, l'm here to
make you a mother, Zohraji.

740
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:52,916
- What?
- Yes.

741
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,956
ln fact,
l'm here to make you a mother.

742
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,118
Yes.

743
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,026
You too?

744
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,156
Ravi said,
that it's no big deal for you.

745
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,628
Please don't say no, Zohraji.

746
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,063
Only you can make this possible.

747
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,467
We have come here with high hopes.

748
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:15,500
Rascals!
Scoundrels! Perverts! Shameless!

749
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,678
You see a delicate blossom
and you want to pluck it away!

750
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,010
Perverts!

751
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:23,644
Perverts?

752
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:24,943
You've got it all wrong.

753
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,055
You merely have to act as
his mother in front of his boss.

754
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,888
Explain it to her.
She thinks we are perverts.

755
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,458
Zohraji, it's not about
nature's rule, but money rules!

756
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,121
Yes.

757
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,529
At least listen to my problem.

758
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,436
Your story is
emotionally very right...

759
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,169
but making me your
mother is very wrong.

760
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,808
ln a few minutes Prithvi
will figure me out.

761
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,910
Oh no, he isn't a pervert.

762
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,708
That's not what l meant!

763
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,638
l mean,
he will see through the lie.

764
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,643
And realise that l'm
not the mother because...

765
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,248
l don't look as old as a mother.

766
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,512
But... you see...

767
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,051
you can make me a lover,
a friend, a younger sister too.

768
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,986
But l am too young for this role!

769
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,930
And to be honest,
now its time for my second act.

770
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:11,968
l'll leave now.

771
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,135
l'm the gorgeous princess.

772
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,035
l'm the passionate queen.

773
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,570
She will drop dead in two days!

774
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,170
lt's my curse!

775
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,480
But in two hours
Prithviji will be home.

776
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,107
What do we do?

777
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:33,153
Look for a mother!

778
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,988
How did we get trapped into this?

779
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,261
Where the hell are the guys?

780
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,191
What are you doing up there?

781
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,927
- Move it.
- Get lost!

782
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:49,897
Sir is here.

783
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,799
What do we do now?

784
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,708
My God!

785
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,679
Abhishek!

786
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,610
Wait.

787
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,878
Let them keep knocking.

788
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,587
They'll get tired
of knocking and leave.

789
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,519
Abhishek?

790
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,088
Shastri!

791
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:13,959
Yes, sir!

792
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:17,897
lf you weren't my father...

793
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,831
l'd have torn your dhoti
and tied it around your neck.

794
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:20,562
Move it!

795
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,571
You think you are Batman?

796
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,201
Prithviji... hello.

797
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,838
Please come in.

798
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,611
'Home swine home.'

799
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:38,684
Shastri?

800
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:39,312
Sir.

801
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,786
You've killed enough lizards,
Shastri.

802
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,320
Time you got down.

803
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,151
Mother isn't here.

804
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,220
Yes.
He is so sincere.

805
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,822
He observed his fast and
even came here to break it.

806
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,594
Right, Prithviji?

807
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,326
Oh no!

808
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,701
Mother isn't here.

809
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,770
lt's true.

810
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,871
- Mother isn't here.
- Mother isn't here?

811
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,540
She has gone to the temple.

812
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,010
l tried to make her wait,
Prithviji.

813
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,871
But even with her bad cold,
she went to offer her prayers.

814
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,746
She may take a while to get back.

815
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,342
Why don't we break
the fast and eat?

816
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:11,120
Yes.

817
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,177
- Let me set the table.
- Come on.

818
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,289
Listen...

819
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,988
how can you even say that?

820
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,360
We've observed
this fast for mother.

821
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,364
Let her come back,
then we will eat.

822
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:41,713
Sir...

823
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,751
it's taken too long
for mother to return.

824
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:46,781
You see, Prithviji...

825
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,850
once my mother begins
to chant 'Hari Om'...

826
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,051
she doesn't feel the
need to get back 'Home'.

827
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,326
So, let's eat?

828
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:56,188
No.

829
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,332
Why don't we go to the temple?

830
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:02,162
Sit!

831
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,773
l mean, you must
be tired sitting there.

832
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:06,399
Yes.

833
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,337
Right, Prithviji?

834
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,408
So let's go... to the temple.

835
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,749
That's not necessary.

836
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,656
Mother is here.

837
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:25,992
Mother!

838
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,696
Prithviji, mother is here.

839
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,994
Uncle, mother is here.

840
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,365
Ravi, mother is here.

841
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:34,431
Mother!

842
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,828
Mother is here!

843
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:38,739
Mother is here!

844
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,868
Tell it to the village
that mother is here.

845
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,436
Prithviji, this is my mother.

846
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:54,419
This is a charm
of my beautiful hair.

847
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:59,320
Prithviji, please have a seat.
Why are you standing?

848
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:07,196
l thank you very much
for giving my son ajob.

849
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,372
The Lord is great!

850
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,963
Very nice.

851
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,011
Such holy thoughts.
A holy family, a holy atmosphere.

852
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,337
So how holy are you?

853
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:21,845
Sir!

854
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,475
l mean, how's your health?

855
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,286
What can l say about my health.

856
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:27,316
ln fact my beauty...

857
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:33,886
that gave in to my old age,
is what keeps me going on.

858
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,696
lt's a license.

859
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,063
And there's this rascal.

860
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,498
Every time l call, he comes to me.

861
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,234
Son!

862
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:43,801
Abhishek.

863
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:45,797
What is it mother? Tell me.

864
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,268
l didn't call out.
That was from behind.

865
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:50,841
Son!

866
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,954
Your mother is here.

867
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,488
Your mother is here.

868
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,593
Why are you staring?
Let me bless you.

869
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,025
Mother!

870
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,063
Listen...

871
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,021
Who is she?

872
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,528
Mother.

873
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,633
She is also your mother?

874
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,866
Sir, she isn't the mother.

875
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,635
She isn't the mother?

876
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,229
Very true.

877
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,236
She isn't the mother.

878
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,037
She is my nanny.

879
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:20,838
Nanny?

880
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:21,899
Yes, nanny.

881
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,576
She is my mother.

882
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:24,510
She is the nanny.

883
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:25,706
She gave birth to me.

884
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,272
She helped me come into this world.

885
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:29,182
Yes, Prithviji.

886
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,155
lf she is the sea of love,
then she is the river.

887
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,083
And he came into this
world with her help.

888
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:37,082
Right?

889
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,756
You see that, Maakhan?

890
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:42,925
This is what l call values.

891
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,530
He loves both of them equally.

892
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:46,736
Yes, Prithviji.

893
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,861
Ever since he was a kid,
he has been naughty.

894
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:53,132
You saw how when the nanny
called him, he looked at me.

895
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,169
- Son!
- Yes, mother.

896
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,236
l didn't speak.

897
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,144
- Oh, Yes nanny.
- me neither.

898
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,606
- No?
- No!

899
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,530
Your mother is here.

900
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:16,956
Let me bless you.

901
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,132
Listen...

902
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,066
Before you even say anything...

903
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,728
l'd like to say something.

904
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,677
Today is an amazing day!

905
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,317
Everyone is perplexed.

906
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,617
Red light and nowhere to go!

907
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,193
How come another mother?

908
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:49,890
Prithviji...

909
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,893
the fact is...

910
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,660
she is my mother...

911
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,671
she is my nanny and...

912
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,164
she is my...

913
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,604
'maid-mother'!

914
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:00,267
'maid-mother'?

915
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,104
Yes.

916
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,179
House maid.

917
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,684
But it's impolite
to just say 'maid'.

918
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,648
Therefore...

919
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:10,750
'maid-mother'.

920
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,718
Wow, Abhishek Bachchan!

921
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,085
Just as righteous your family is...

922
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,957
your character
is just as righteous.

923
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,260
You are so trustworthy
that even at night...

924
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,838
'twelve o'clock at night
you do one night stand for me!'

925
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,167
Let's break the fast
with all three mothers!

926
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:37,107
Okay.

927
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,875
Ravi... l didn't find mother.

928
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,715
l tried a lot but l...

929
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:55,862
Kailash!

930
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:58,292
When will these seizures end!

931
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:01,635
Prithviji, remember Shastri
was saying... ''Mother isn't here.''

932
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:02,896
His mother isn't here.

933
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,271
She went away when he was a kid and
since then he gets these seizures.

934
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:07,735
Snap out of it, Kailash!

935
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,276
See who is in front of you!

936
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,676
ldiot!

937
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,112
The games destiny plays...

938
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,680
He has no mother and
l have three mothers!

939
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:16,649
l'm really tired.

940
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,243
This mother, that mother...

941
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,657
There you are?

942
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:45,738
Where were you?

943
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,380
Look, mother is also
back from the temple.

944
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,319
Prithviji, she isn't my mother.

945
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:52,949
She is my sister...
Sania.

946
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:53,716
Bachchan!

947
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,814
Sania Bachchan.

948
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:55,989
Right!

949
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,821
l just remembered something.

950
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,199
Ghost!

951
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:09,997
Brilliant!

952
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,365
One lie to cover another lie.

953
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,512
And another lie
on top of another...

954
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,306
Of course. You've got
to balance the lies, Shastri.

955
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,040
- Perfect, isn't it?
- You will be thrashed!

956
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,243
Of course we will! Move it.

957
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,512
What's this, Zohraji?

958
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,812
You refused to help us.

959
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,747
Then how did you land up here?

960
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,785
His story touched a chord in me.

961
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,420
And l thought...

962
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:38,864
it's no mean feat for a young
actor to play an old character!

963
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,394
Right, elder sister?

964
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,002
What are you thinking, Abbas?

965
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,113
Prithviji was here to
break the fast with us...

966
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,842
then why did he leave in a hurry?

967
01:00:58,888 --> 01:00:59,980
Ghost!

968
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:01,985
She is a ghost.

969
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,217
She is not a ghost...

970
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,354
but Abhishek's sister, Sania.

971
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,864
And she was Apeksa.

972
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,057
My Apeksa!

973
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,031
lnspector, will it take long?

974
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,899
Well, the Eid prayers will
be done in another five minutes.

975
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,904
No problem, there's no hurry.

976
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,207
Sir...

977
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:43,742
lt was a good thing to
meet the collector of Amergadh.

978
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,972
When the power plant
is set up in Ranakpur...

979
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,146
it will be a delight
to watch Vikrant's face.

980
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,910
The power will switch off his face.

981
01:04:58,661 --> 01:04:59,389
Sir!

982
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:00,993
Abhishek Bachchan!

983
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:02,797
ls he shooting in Amergadh?

984
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:03,863
Not him!

985
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,263
Abhishek Bachchan from Ranakpur.

986
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,267
Over there!

987
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,448
Sania, this was great.

988
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,979
lt's a always good
to enjoy the Eid sweets.

989
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,693
Prithviji... here?

990
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,169
l had told you...

991
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,903
'you may break a relationship...

992
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,974
but never break someone's trust.'

993
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,075
l saw you at Amergadh.

994
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,077
You were celebrating
Eid with the people there.

995
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,152
What is the truth?

996
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,245
Answer me!

997
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,364
You saw me at Amergadh...

998
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:49,870
l'm dead.

999
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,134
And you want an answer.

1000
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,805
Ravi, will you answer?

1001
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,141
But what will you say...

1002
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,445
Even in school you never
answered the questions correctly.

1003
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:11,787
l have an answer, Prithviji.

1004
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,458
Of course!

1005
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,856
The person you saw was me...
yet it wasn't me.

1006
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,690
'lt was you but
it wasn't you...' Huh?

1007
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,933
He was my identical brother, Abbas.

1008
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,872
Abbas?

1009
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,142
Ravi, why are you going back there?

1010
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,773
Yes, Prithviji.

1011
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:38,119
Abhishek has been having a hard
time because of his identical brother.

1012
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:39,554
Since childhood.

1013
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,650
And l know...

1014
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,691
Why don't you tell?

1015
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,655
You know better since
you're his sister.

1016
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,789
He would steal the mango,
and Abhishek would get beaten up.

1017
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:51,489
He would get bit by a dog...

1018
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,501
...and Abhishek would
have to take an injection.

1019
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,003
We are carbon copies, Prithviji.

1020
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:58,906
Except for the moustache.

1021
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:00,702
l'm sure you noticed.

1022
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,473
l keep a moustache,
while he doesn't.

1023
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,907
l'm sure you noticed, Maakhan.

1024
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,274
Except for the moustache,
they look the same.

1025
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:10,619
Like 'Ram and Shyam'.

1026
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,947
Like 'Seeta and Geeta'.

1027
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,919
And similarly,
Abbas Ali and Abhishek Bachchan.

1028
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,288
Prithviji...

1029
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,755
are you doubting my integrity?

1030
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:22,890
Oh no, Abhishek.

1031
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,261
You are my boy...

1032
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,634
'You are my sunflower.'

1033
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:26,633
Wait a minute!

1034
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:30,666
How can Abhishek Bachchan's
brother be Abbas Ali?

1035
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:32,639
How??

1036
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,241
How??

1037
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:36,576
How?

1038
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:40,973
Ravi!

1039
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,786
The warrior knows the truth...

1040
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,015
now what can l say?

1041
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:50,223
Exactly! You're so right.

1042
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,651
What can you say and
how can you reveal that...

1043
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,027
Abbas isn't just your
identical brother...

1044
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:57,862
he is also an illegitimate brother!

1045
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,532
What?

1046
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,225
lllegitimate?

1047
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,235
Yes!

1048
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:03,669
Yes!

1049
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:04,971
Yes!

1050
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,176
What are you staring at?

1051
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,874
Even you know the truth.
Tell them the story.

1052
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,280
- What story?
- the story of illegitimate Abbas.

1053
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:16,582
Start!

1054
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,280
Once his 'married' father
got ajob at a construction site.

1055
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,988
There a girl, by the name Jamila,
would carry bricks.

1056
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,755
Father would break the
rocks and she'd carry bricks.

1057
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,861
She carried bricks,
father broke rocks.

1058
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,296
And then a rock fell
upon his father's sensibility.

1059
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,162
He decided to counter
Jamila's bricks with his rocks!

1060
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,675
And they went behind the rocks.

1061
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,841
Where they made love!

1062
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,250
What happened then?

1063
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,614
Then one day,
nine months later, at night...

1064
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,244
- Day or night?
- Both!

1065
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,380
The day brought Abhishek
into world and...

1066
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,190
the same night, Abbas was born.

1067
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:04,226
Where is Abbas' mother?

1068
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,167
Where is mother?

1069
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:11,731
She isn't alive.

1070
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,871
And that's the reason
Abbas lives with us.

1071
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,237
Abhishek has taken both my and
Abbas' responsibility upon himself.

1072
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,942
What does he do?

1073
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,084
Nothing at all.
He's a dancer.

1074
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,252
Dancer!

1075
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,614
Prithviji, he is a high
class classical dancer.

1076
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:31,684
ls that so?

1077
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,053
l'd like to meet him.

1078
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:37,189
Prithviji,
he can't be of any use to you.

1079
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,261
You are like a warrior...

1080
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:40,828
while he...

1081
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,609
Then he is definitely of use to me!

1082
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:49,575
What?!

1083
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:51,935
You won't get it!

1084
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,344
Tell him to meet
me and he'll get ajob.

1085
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:55,615
Prithviji...

1086
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,182
why are you doing all of this?

1087
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,583
l have to reduce some of the
burden from your head, Abhishek.

1088
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:02,990
We aren't like a
boss and an employee.

1089
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,259
Your mother is my mother.

1090
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,360
Your brother is my brother.

1091
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:08,954
- Your sister...
- Sir!

1092
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:10,089
Let's go, Maakhan!

1093
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,097
ldiots! Scoundrels!

1094
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,736
My father broke rocks?

1095
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,972
My father made love
to another woman? And you?

1096
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,673
What did you whisper
in Prithviji's ear?

1097
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:23,373
What?!

1098
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,239
How can l meet him as Abbas?

1099
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:27,815
Don't you worry!

1100
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,744
l will create such a
fabulous Abbas out of you...

1101
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:30,716
that Prithviji will
never figure it out.

1102
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:31,718
Trust me!

1103
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:56,040
lf this battery doesn't work,
then use the other one.

1104
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,044
You fool!

1105
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,977
What are you looking at? Carry on!

1106
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,162
Abhishek Bachchan?

1107
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,397
Hey crazy fans, guess who l am...

1108
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,306
l've come from afar, who am l?

1109
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,211
Abbas?

1110
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:34,377
But Prithviji...

1111
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:37,412
l thought you were a real man...

1112
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:41,889
but you are a blotch on mankind!

1113
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:44,119
Shut up!

1114
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,285
He isn't Prithvi...

1115
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,060
l am.

1116
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:56,927
Greetings.

1117
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,807
Abbas...

1118
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:02,442
why haven't you kept a moustache?

1119
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,940
Because l never got one!

1120
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:06,409
Why not?

1121
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,181
Because l'm more like my mother.

1122
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,653
Anyway, tell me,
why did you ask me to come here?

1123
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,117
Your brother said that
you are a good dancer.

1124
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,787
For fun, sir. Fun.

1125
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,089
Abhishek, what's this?

1126
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,389
Not Abhishek,
but his brother, Abbas.

1127
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,198
One's a 'man',
the other a 'dancer'.

1128
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,301
Radhika...

1129
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,235
he will be your dance
instructor from tomorrow.

1130
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,271
What?

1131
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,468
l've taken the onus to help you.

1132
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,137
But l can't come here.

1133
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,803
ln that case,
you can't leave this place.

1134
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,414
All day l look
after my sick mother.

1135
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,274
Then you come here at night.

1136
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:43,885
l will not come!

1137
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:44,850
Fine!

1138
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,681
Lock him up and call Abhishek!

1139
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,187
l will come.

1140
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:49,789
Nine o'clock.

1141
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,927
Listen...

1142
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:55,963
Brother, why don't you check...

1143
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,292
if he even knows to dance
or is merely faking it...

1144
01:13:58,734 --> 01:13:59,962
She is right!

1145
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:01,962
Let me see your talent.

1146
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,397
- Maakhan!
- Sir!

1147
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:07,236
Music!

1148
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,359
Dance!

1149
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:53,753
Pappu!

1150
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,005
Pappu control!

1151
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,080
Abbas!
Abbas, stop!

1152
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:30,473
Enog is enog!

1153
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,314
Starting tomorrow,
you can teach Radhika dancing.

1154
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,386
Because a fish out of water...

1155
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,980
'fish and chips without water'...

1156
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,121
is like dancing in the dark...

1157
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,328
'disco dancer without
electric meter'!

1158
01:16:47,273 --> 01:16:48,262
Listen, Hari...

1159
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:51,601
there's an easy way
to go from fat to 'fit-fat'.

1160
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:53,936
- you only need to Let go of
three things. - What's that, sir?

1161
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,545
Breakfast, lunch and dinner!

1162
01:16:58,251 --> 01:17:00,879
Sir, why did you give Abbas ajob?

1163
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:01,943
Shastri...

1164
01:17:02,655 --> 01:17:05,920
it's not often that you
meet such 'blue-coated' people.

1165
01:17:06,392 --> 01:17:07,552
'Blue-coated'?

1166
01:17:07,727 --> 01:17:08,785
'Out of the blues!'

1167
01:17:09,562 --> 01:17:11,189
Oh no, sir. He is useless.

1168
01:17:11,397 --> 01:17:13,695
- But He is of use to me.
- Sir!

1169
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:19,403
l mean, he will be
Radhika's dance instructor.

1170
01:17:19,672 --> 01:17:21,264
My sister will be in safe hands.

1171
01:17:22,342 --> 01:17:23,741
Abbas, you were brilliant.

1172
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:26,508
lf the record company was there...

1173
01:17:26,646 --> 01:17:28,807
they would have launched
a remix album of your performance!

1174
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:32,941
And like me, even you would
be world famous here in Ranakpur.

1175
01:17:34,254 --> 01:17:35,243
Tell me something...

1176
01:17:35,855 --> 01:17:36,651
your father...

1177
01:17:36,723 --> 01:17:37,382
Father?

1178
01:17:37,457 --> 01:17:38,446
Shastri!

1179
01:17:38,558 --> 01:17:39,456
Oh!

1180
01:17:39,525 --> 01:17:40,890
He did help me
with ajob but where?

1181
01:17:41,561 --> 01:17:43,461
l mean, with that
mountain of a warrior!

1182
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,900
Not just a warrior...
wild buffalo!

1183
01:17:51,204 --> 01:17:52,694
- Forget it.
- How can l Forget it?

1184
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:54,497
'Hard work is the
keyhole to saxophone'?

1185
01:17:54,574 --> 01:17:55,632
Saxophone?

1186
01:17:55,842 --> 01:17:57,309
He can lift a 100 kilos but...

1187
01:17:57,377 --> 01:17:58,605
he doesn't have an
ounce of intelligence.

1188
01:17:58,678 --> 01:18:01,511
lf he had, in a minute
he would've realized that...

1189
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:03,048
l am Abhishek Bachchan
and also Abbas Ali.

1190
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,944
- Why are you saying all of that?
- What's wrong with you?

1191
01:18:12,492 --> 01:18:13,982
Great!

1192
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:16,588
You really are
good at staging acts.

1193
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:20,428
l came here to tell you to stop your
brother from coming to my place.

1194
01:18:20,967 --> 01:18:22,696
But now l will stop my brother...

1195
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:25,470
stop him from trusting
frauds like you!

1196
01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:28,866
He's very simple and naive too...

1197
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:30,970
and you are taking
advantage of that fact.

1198
01:18:31,544 --> 01:18:33,671
l'm going... to tell him the truth.

1199
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:35,403
Radhika...

1200
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:38,708
you may tell your
brother the truth.

1201
01:18:39,252 --> 01:18:42,551
But at least listen
to why we had to lie.

1202
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:49,455
Radhika, a man doesn't fulfill
his life merely by living it.

1203
01:18:50,029 --> 01:18:53,055
He fulfills it by taking care of
the responsibilities of his family.

1204
01:18:54,434 --> 01:18:55,992
Abbas had some dreams for me.

1205
01:18:56,669 --> 01:18:59,399
But our family property in Delhi was
snatched away from us illegally.

1206
01:18:59,772 --> 01:19:01,034
Abbas lost his job.

1207
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:03,541
Uncle Shastri brought
us here to Ranakpur.

1208
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:07,039
And to save a child from drowning,
Abbas broke the temple lock.

1209
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:09,076
And to save the situation...

1210
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:11,943
l said Abbas Ali's
name is Abhishek Bachchan.

1211
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:15,987
But when Prithviji gave
Abbas such a good job...

1212
01:19:16,689 --> 01:19:21,422
our lie didn't seem that wrong.

1213
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:23,522
Radhika, nobody makes a mistake...

1214
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:25,795
mistakes happen.

1215
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,397
What you've said is right.

1216
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:33,803
lf you want to tell Prithviji
the truth, please go ahead.

1217
01:19:35,575 --> 01:19:36,974
You know my brother very well!

1218
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:39,473
lf he finds out the truth...

1219
01:19:39,645 --> 01:19:41,442
he will break all of you to pieces.

1220
01:19:41,714 --> 01:19:45,912
lt's because of this
fear that we couldn't confess.

1221
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:52,113
Radhika...

1222
01:19:53,092 --> 01:19:56,687
now you may do as you wish.

1223
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,529
Listen...

1224
01:20:11,644 --> 01:20:13,509
You may start teaching
me dance tomorrow.

1225
01:20:15,348 --> 01:20:16,337
Goodbye.

1226
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:12,234
Ghost!

1227
01:25:13,646 --> 01:25:15,807
Ghosts are a bundle of lies.

1228
01:25:17,049 --> 01:25:19,313
She is Abhishek's sister,
Sania Bachchan.

1229
01:25:22,388 --> 01:25:24,413
Prithviji, l'm glad you are here.

1230
01:25:24,724 --> 01:25:26,817
Wonder where Ravi
and his friends are.

1231
01:25:27,927 --> 01:25:30,896
lf you don't mind,
will you rehearse with me?

1232
01:25:32,198 --> 01:25:34,223
l don't have any experience.

1233
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,926
Your eyes say it all.

1234
01:25:36,669 --> 01:25:37,966
You only have to deliver
these four lines.

1235
01:25:38,137 --> 01:25:39,161
And then it's my dialogue.

1236
01:25:39,472 --> 01:25:40,769
l can't deliver...

1237
01:25:41,073 --> 01:25:43,064
l mean, say these lines.

1238
01:25:44,477 --> 01:25:45,466
Listen...

1239
01:25:46,011 --> 01:25:47,273
l know to say, 'listen'.

1240
01:25:47,346 --> 01:25:48,278
Excellent!

1241
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:50,008
So look at me and say these lines.

1242
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:51,839
Okay.

1243
01:25:52,418 --> 01:25:53,407
Start.

1244
01:25:55,855 --> 01:26:00,019
Listen to what l have to say!

1245
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:02,192
Goodness gracious!

1246
01:26:02,261 --> 01:26:04,821
Are you admitting your
love or making a war declaration.

1247
01:26:05,731 --> 01:26:06,789
Take it easy.

1248
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:14,966
Lis...ten... l... have...
to... say... some... thing...

1249
01:26:16,776 --> 01:26:20,007
Now it seems like you are
a toy that has been wound up!

1250
01:26:21,213 --> 01:26:23,875
Let it come from your heart, okay?

1251
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,439
Start!

1252
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:27,284
Listen...

1253
01:26:27,353 --> 01:26:28,911
listen to me...

1254
01:26:28,988 --> 01:26:30,148
at least listen to me...

1255
01:26:30,456 --> 01:26:32,515
listen,
'l say to something have...'

1256
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:34,316
Why don't you listen...

1257
01:26:35,895 --> 01:26:37,328
Enough!
You can't do it!

1258
01:26:37,897 --> 01:26:39,797
The character is admitting
that he is in love...

1259
01:26:40,132 --> 01:26:42,498
Prithviji, you have to feel
every word, not merely rattle it!

1260
01:26:43,002 --> 01:26:43,991
But you...

1261
01:26:45,104 --> 01:26:45,900
never mind!

1262
01:26:45,971 --> 01:26:46,995
You can't do this.

1263
01:26:47,173 --> 01:26:48,162
Listen...

1264
01:26:49,308 --> 01:26:50,935
there's something l have to say.

1265
01:26:52,478 --> 01:26:55,379
Don't shoot arrows
from those eyes...

1266
01:26:56,148 --> 01:26:58,776
Don't take my life, my love...

1267
01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:04,151
Should then my
soul leave my body...

1268
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:06,815
Hail Prithviji!

1269
01:27:06,892 --> 01:27:07,620
Hurray!

1270
01:27:07,693 --> 01:27:08,318
Hail Prithviji!

1271
01:27:08,561 --> 01:27:09,050
Hurray!

1272
01:27:09,128 --> 01:27:10,322
Prithviji, unbelievable!

1273
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:11,552
l have a few words for you...

1274
01:27:12,031 --> 01:27:14,795
'You carried weights and
now your words have weight!'

1275
01:27:14,867 --> 01:27:15,333
Wow!

1276
01:27:15,568 --> 01:27:18,162
'There's a spark of romance
in this action hero!'

1277
01:27:18,237 --> 01:27:19,204
Wow!

1278
01:27:19,271 --> 01:27:20,966
Thanks for the 'complan boy'.

1279
01:27:21,273 --> 01:27:23,002
Prithviji, l have a small request.

1280
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:26,110
We have a heroine for our play,
why don't you play the hero?

1281
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:27,703
Oh no, no, no!

1282
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,213
This is not my cup of 'lassi'.

1283
01:27:29,715 --> 01:27:30,841
No, sir! lt's a request!

1284
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:31,939
Please!

1285
01:27:33,085 --> 01:27:35,144
Listen, l won't be able to do this.

1286
01:27:35,654 --> 01:27:36,313
But...

1287
01:27:36,555 --> 01:27:38,022
l could produce your play.

1288
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:40,053
Make it grand!

1289
01:27:40,226 --> 01:27:41,250
That's amazing!

1290
01:27:42,194 --> 01:27:43,752
You have my support.

1291
01:27:46,899 --> 01:27:47,797
Hail Prithviji!

1292
01:27:47,867 --> 01:27:48,765
Hurray!

1293
01:27:48,834 --> 01:27:50,631
We got a producer!

1294
01:27:53,172 --> 01:27:54,036
Wow, Abhishek!

1295
01:27:54,106 --> 01:27:55,903
You've noted every penny.

1296
01:27:56,942 --> 01:27:58,239
You are a 'mind blow dryer'!

1297
01:27:59,712 --> 01:28:01,145
Maakhan, a real gem!

1298
01:28:05,918 --> 01:28:06,942
Yes sir... no sir...

1299
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:09,280
Radhika, what are you watching?

1300
01:28:09,989 --> 01:28:10,751
Golmaal.

1301
01:28:10,823 --> 01:28:12,723
l lied to you hence ''no'' sir.

1302
01:28:12,858 --> 01:28:13,790
Shut up!

1303
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:15,690
l saw you in the stadium...

1304
01:28:15,861 --> 01:28:17,886
l was shocked to see you like that.

1305
01:28:17,963 --> 01:28:19,692
With that moustache
you look so different.

1306
01:28:20,065 --> 01:28:22,363
Yes l'm doing a double role...

1307
01:28:22,835 --> 01:28:23,893
of twin brothers...

1308
01:28:23,969 --> 01:28:26,130
One has a moustache
and the other doesn't.

1309
01:28:26,906 --> 01:28:28,032
lt's not your fault.

1310
01:28:28,173 --> 01:28:31,040
- What do you mean?
- Don't get so worked up!

1311
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:33,344
My father used to say...

1312
01:28:33,746 --> 01:28:36,681
What is it your father said?

1313
01:28:36,849 --> 01:28:39,682
Sir, my father said...

1314
01:28:40,286 --> 01:28:45,349
'With a million bricks of
hard work, man builds his home.'

1315
01:28:45,724 --> 01:28:46,418
Sir.

1316
01:28:46,659 --> 01:28:49,822
Priceless words, my dear!

1317
01:28:51,096 --> 01:28:55,260
Just like your father, you
should break it all brick by brick!

1318
01:28:55,768 --> 01:28:56,757
Sir?

1319
01:28:57,336 --> 01:28:58,894
What are you trying to say?

1320
01:28:59,104 --> 01:29:01,470
The one you saw
was not Ramprasad...

1321
01:29:01,974 --> 01:29:04,067
He was Laxmanprasad
Dhashrathprasad Sharma...

1322
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:05,843
my identical twin brother.

1323
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,274
Sir, please come.

1324
01:29:12,418 --> 01:29:13,043
Where?

1325
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:14,210
Come with me...

1326
01:29:14,286 --> 01:29:16,254
l want to show you something.
Please come.

1327
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:19,046
See.

1328
01:29:20,025 --> 01:29:21,390
l have a moustache, he doesn't.

1329
01:29:21,994 --> 01:29:22,983
Golmaal.

1330
01:29:23,362 --> 01:29:24,192
l've seen it many times.

1331
01:29:24,263 --> 01:29:25,457
l'm sure you remember the story.

1332
01:29:26,231 --> 01:29:29,428
Yes, Amol Palekar spins a web
of lies about a twin brother and...

1333
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:32,831
l hope he isn't spinning
a similar web of lies around you.

1334
01:29:33,739 --> 01:29:38,472
You are my boss, if you
want to sack me, please go ahead.

1335
01:29:40,813 --> 01:29:41,802
Me?

1336
01:29:42,014 --> 01:29:42,810
Yes.

1337
01:29:42,881 --> 01:29:45,679
But why would Amol
Palekar lie to me?

1338
01:29:45,851 --> 01:29:48,046
Not Amol Palekar,
Abhishek Bachchan!

1339
01:29:48,354 --> 01:29:49,685
Have you lost it?

1340
01:29:50,356 --> 01:29:51,789
You're equating
a film to real life!

1341
01:29:51,857 --> 01:29:54,883
No, l'm equating
real life to a film.

1342
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,894
But these things
happen in real life.

1343
01:29:57,296 --> 01:30:00,231
lsn't Sania identical to Apeksa?

1344
01:30:01,033 --> 01:30:03,160
You think a obedient
person like Abhishek will lie?

1345
01:30:03,535 --> 01:30:05,469
You think his pious
mother will lie?

1346
01:30:05,904 --> 01:30:07,303
Have you ever seen such
a well-cultured family?

1347
01:30:07,373 --> 01:30:09,034
l haven't and that's
why l think so!

1348
01:30:09,174 --> 01:30:10,869
'When the first is incoming,
the other is outgoing.'

1349
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:12,443
'And when the other is outgoing,
the first is incoming.'

1350
01:30:12,845 --> 01:30:15,746
There's never been a cross
connection in this roaming facility!

1351
01:30:16,015 --> 01:30:19,314
lf these 'two SlM cards' actually
belong to 'one phone' then...

1352
01:30:19,718 --> 01:30:23,711
the Prithviraj who is
brave and strong and revered...

1353
01:30:23,789 --> 01:30:25,347
would have been fooled by a nobody!

1354
01:30:25,758 --> 01:30:28,420
Think about what that
will do to your image.

1355
01:30:29,361 --> 01:30:30,919
Prithviji,
my name is lrfan Pathan...

1356
01:30:31,096 --> 01:30:32,893
and this is my identical
brother Mahendra Singh Dhoni!

1357
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,199
Come on.

1358
01:30:51,216 --> 01:30:52,240
Abhishek...

1359
01:30:53,218 --> 01:30:54,947
We need to discuss Abbas' salary.

1360
01:30:55,921 --> 01:30:56,945
Can he come now?

1361
01:30:58,123 --> 01:30:59,283
Now?

1362
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:01,986
Now, he is looking after mother.

1363
01:31:02,227 --> 01:31:03,888
l'll send him as
soon as l get home.

1364
01:31:17,109 --> 01:31:18,576
Why did you lock the door?

1365
01:31:19,211 --> 01:31:21,839
Because this lock will
unlock the other lock.

1366
01:31:22,214 --> 01:31:23,511
lt's a necessity, sir.

1367
01:31:27,019 --> 01:31:30,045
'Necessity is the mother
of Discovery channel!'

1368
01:31:38,597 --> 01:31:40,360
Radhika,
why did Maakhan lock the door?

1369
01:31:40,599 --> 01:31:42,692
Because he's taken Prithvi
to see who are not there.

1370
01:31:43,068 --> 01:31:43,727
Who?

1371
01:31:43,802 --> 01:31:44,791
Abbas and mother!

1372
01:31:46,205 --> 01:31:47,570
Please go hurry up.

1373
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:02,609
See sir...

1374
01:32:02,855 --> 01:32:04,880
neither is he here,
nor is his mother!

1375
01:32:05,157 --> 01:32:06,590
They've vanished into thin air!

1376
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:07,848
They aren't here...

1377
01:32:07,926 --> 01:32:09,052
there's no use looking for them.

1378
01:32:21,673 --> 01:32:23,038
Prithviji, what brings you here?

1379
01:32:25,144 --> 01:32:27,738
l was passing by and
saw the house and thought...

1380
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,314
You thought of watching
the road from the house?

1381
01:32:34,353 --> 01:32:35,718
Hello, mother.

1382
01:32:35,888 --> 01:32:37,014
Hello, mother.

1383
01:32:37,222 --> 01:32:38,780
She isn't answering
nor looking eye to eye.

1384
01:32:38,857 --> 01:32:39,824
What's the matter?

1385
01:32:39,892 --> 01:32:41,951
Because she just shut her eyes,
blind man!

1386
01:32:42,094 --> 01:32:43,322
So, shhhh!

1387
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,758
How is her health now?

1388
01:32:49,902 --> 01:32:51,301
As usual, just lying around.

1389
01:32:51,904 --> 01:32:52,393
l...

1390
01:32:52,638 --> 01:32:56,039
l'd like to say something,
if you don't mind.

1391
01:32:57,075 --> 01:33:02,069
lt's not good to
visit someone so often.

1392
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:05,241
lt lowers ones respect.

1393
01:33:10,088 --> 01:33:11,248
Let's go, Maakhan.

1394
01:33:12,891 --> 01:33:13,880
Sir!

1395
01:33:14,059 --> 01:33:17,085
She has hairy legs, how?

1396
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:21,063
How does mother have hairy legs?

1397
01:33:22,668 --> 01:33:24,431
You think instead
of hair on her legs...

1398
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:25,932
there should be legs in her hair?

1399
01:33:26,004 --> 01:33:27,699
Prithviji, tell me something.

1400
01:33:28,106 --> 01:33:31,007
You think at this old age, my
mother should visit a beauty parlor?

1401
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:35,806
lt's my time to get manicured,
pedicured, and waxed.

1402
01:33:38,483 --> 01:33:41,919
Anyway, he has always
been a scoundrel.

1403
01:33:41,987 --> 01:33:42,476
What?

1404
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:44,018
- you too?
- What?

1405
01:33:44,122 --> 01:33:45,111
Unbelievable!

1406
01:33:45,891 --> 01:33:52,854
How could you employ someone who
thinks about my mother's hairy legs?

1407
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,729
They're gone!

1408
01:34:02,908 --> 01:34:03,806
Gone?

1409
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:05,137
Wow!

1410
01:34:05,677 --> 01:34:06,939
Abbas, that was close!

1411
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:09,940
Oh no!

1412
01:34:10,215 --> 01:34:11,375
What happened?

1413
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:12,917
Prithviji has left for the mansion.

1414
01:34:13,118 --> 01:34:14,050
So?

1415
01:34:14,119 --> 01:34:15,108
So?

1416
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,651
Abbas is here!

1417
01:34:16,888 --> 01:34:18,856
But Abhishek Bachchan isn't there!

1418
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:28,090
Oh God! Now we're dead!

1419
01:34:35,707 --> 01:34:37,106
You were checking
out mother's hair?

1420
01:34:38,477 --> 01:34:40,741
Prithviji,
Abbas called and told me.

1421
01:34:40,846 --> 01:34:41,835
l will...

1422
01:34:41,947 --> 01:34:42,936
Abhishek...

1423
01:34:43,915 --> 01:34:45,780
Your brother has
already slapped him.

1424
01:34:45,884 --> 01:34:48,114
Anyway, he has always
been a scoundrel.

1425
01:34:48,186 --> 01:34:48,845
Huh?

1426
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,682
But you too?

1427
01:34:49,755 --> 01:34:50,949
- What?
- Unbelievable!

1428
01:34:52,457 --> 01:34:53,754
You doubted me?

1429
01:34:54,293 --> 01:34:55,260
Me?

1430
01:34:55,327 --> 01:34:56,794
Oh no, Abhishek!

1431
01:34:56,962 --> 01:34:59,226
Don't get emotional,
'pest control yourself!'

1432
01:35:00,098 --> 01:35:02,396
You're like a younger brother,
you're my own!

1433
01:35:02,701 --> 01:35:03,929
No, Prithviji.

1434
01:35:04,136 --> 01:35:05,125
l'm resigning!

1435
01:35:05,804 --> 01:35:06,793
That's fine...

1436
01:35:06,938 --> 01:35:10,135
but don't quit your
job because of your anger.

1437
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:12,899
Prithviji!

1438
01:35:13,478 --> 01:35:16,413
Don't you realize which is the bone
that supports your spine and...

1439
01:35:16,715 --> 01:35:18,706
which is the bone that
will get stuck in your throat?

1440
01:35:19,051 --> 01:35:19,983
Maakhan!

1441
01:35:20,052 --> 01:35:21,144
- sir.
- Say it...

1442
01:35:22,187 --> 01:35:23,176
Say it...

1443
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:25,179
say that they are one.

1444
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:28,285
Say that after we left,
someone opened the lock...

1445
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,987
and he got there before us...

1446
01:35:30,062 --> 01:35:33,190
took off his moustache and
began massaging his mother's legs.

1447
01:35:33,265 --> 01:35:34,732
- No, sir.
- Say it!

1448
01:35:34,933 --> 01:35:37,959
And say that before we
could get here, he made it and...

1449
01:35:38,036 --> 01:35:40,129
who had opened the lock before,
locked him in again and...

1450
01:35:40,205 --> 01:35:42,298
he put on a fake moustache!

1451
01:35:42,374 --> 01:35:43,341
- No, sir.
- Say it!

1452
01:35:43,408 --> 01:35:44,397
No, sir.

1453
01:35:44,776 --> 01:35:45,765
No, sir.

1454
01:35:45,911 --> 01:35:47,276
He is fake?

1455
01:35:47,379 --> 01:35:48,744
No, sir.
Forgive me.

1456
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,075
- this is fake?
- No, sir.

1457
01:35:51,383 --> 01:35:52,372
Pull it!

1458
01:35:52,751 --> 01:35:53,217
No, sir.

1459
01:35:53,285 --> 01:35:55,276
- Pull it, l say.
- No, sir. Forgive me!

1460
01:35:55,354 --> 01:35:57,083
Try to pull it.

1461
01:35:57,889 --> 01:35:58,878
Pull it!

1462
01:36:00,025 --> 01:36:01,014
Sir!

1463
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,898
You're pulling it!

1464
01:36:16,141 --> 01:36:17,938
You're still trying to pull it!

1465
01:36:21,747 --> 01:36:23,305
You humiliated me
in front of Abhishek.

1466
01:36:23,615 --> 01:36:25,014
'My eyes have fallen from my face!'

1467
01:36:26,351 --> 01:36:28,876
lf his mother learns about this,
she will be hurt.

1468
01:36:32,557 --> 01:36:33,319
Mother!

1469
01:36:33,558 --> 01:36:34,286
Where?

1470
01:36:34,526 --> 01:36:35,754
Over there.

1471
01:36:44,069 --> 01:36:48,130
'You found time to confess.'

1472
01:36:48,974 --> 01:36:54,879
'But this life proved
too short for me to sin.'

1473
01:36:57,315 --> 01:37:00,682
'l will land at your door,
over and over again.'

1474
01:37:00,952 --> 01:37:04,854
'l will land at your door,
over and over again.'

1475
01:37:10,228 --> 01:37:12,219
'Ring the door bell
and run away like hell.'

1476
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:16,892
That's a load of crap, old woman!

1477
01:37:17,068 --> 01:37:21,368
Zohra, till when will you
torture us with your sorrow?

1478
01:37:21,773 --> 01:37:24,970
With cameraman Yogesh,
Rajan Chaurasiya, Aajtak.

1479
01:37:30,582 --> 01:37:33,813
Zohra, does that mean
l'm the father of your child?

1480
01:37:33,885 --> 01:37:36,115
You should grow up for that,
bald man!

1481
01:37:37,789 --> 01:37:39,188
So, how did it happen?

1482
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,089
Well...

1483
01:37:44,362 --> 01:37:45,886
How did the miracle happen?

1484
01:37:46,765 --> 01:37:48,130
Well...

1485
01:37:48,967 --> 01:37:50,434
How did it happen?

1486
01:37:50,802 --> 01:37:51,791
Well...

1487
01:37:52,938 --> 01:37:54,963
- How did the miracle happen!
- Get lost!

1488
01:37:58,877 --> 01:38:04,315
Oh God, make this problem go away!

1489
01:38:08,286 --> 01:38:11,016
Greetings, mother!

1490
01:38:12,924 --> 01:38:13,913
Greetings.

1491
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:17,822
Who are you?
And who are you looking for?

1492
01:38:18,029 --> 01:38:19,018
Great!

1493
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:22,392
Signs of danger and
the chameleon changes color!

1494
01:38:22,834 --> 01:38:25,928
Don't you recognize
Prithviraj Raghuvanshi?

1495
01:38:26,438 --> 01:38:28,872
Do l know you?

1496
01:38:32,377 --> 01:38:33,867
That's up to you.

1497
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,073
But now l know you very well.

1498
01:38:37,148 --> 01:38:38,137
Yes!

1499
01:38:38,683 --> 01:38:40,776
A saintly widow
and a seductive vamp!

1500
01:38:41,186 --> 01:38:42,175
Widow?

1501
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:50,318
l guess you met my twin, Madhumati.

1502
01:38:50,462 --> 01:38:51,952
That's not me.

1503
01:38:53,231 --> 01:38:55,199
l also have two
identical nephews...

1504
01:38:55,267 --> 01:38:56,734
Abhishek and Abbas.

1505
01:38:57,435 --> 01:38:59,926
My sister and l also
had identical mothers...

1506
01:39:00,038 --> 01:39:01,300
Leelavati and Nanavati.

1507
01:39:01,773 --> 01:39:05,834
ls it a family or an identical
children producing factory?

1508
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:08,277
You foul-mouthed good-for-nothing,
l'll show you!

1509
01:39:08,346 --> 01:39:09,142
What?

1510
01:39:09,214 --> 01:39:10,203
Sir...

1511
01:39:10,682 --> 01:39:13,947
Sir, he even looks
like a scoundrel.

1512
01:39:14,085 --> 01:39:14,676
Huh?

1513
01:39:14,753 --> 01:39:15,447
But you too?

1514
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,954
- What?
- Unbelievable!

1515
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:21,350
Couldn't you tell the
difference between...

1516
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:23,860
'Saintly Madhumati'
and 'Seductive Zohra'?

1517
01:39:24,462 --> 01:39:28,398
Forgive me,
l was misled by the poster.

1518
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:29,860
'Zohra, The lnfamous'

1519
01:39:29,935 --> 01:39:31,835
Only for you, darling!

1520
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:35,906
lt's a song, sir.

1521
01:39:36,007 --> 01:39:40,410
That reminds me,
please convey my regards to Madhu.

1522
01:39:40,812 --> 01:39:44,942
And also tell her
that Zohra misses her.

1523
01:39:53,325 --> 01:39:54,485
Wait a minute, sir.

1524
01:39:55,193 --> 01:39:57,491
How can Madhumati's
sister be Zohra?

1525
01:39:58,163 --> 01:40:00,723
Maakhan,
it won't be nice to hear...

1526
01:40:00,799 --> 01:40:02,858
the 'rock and brick'
story from a lady.

1527
01:40:03,368 --> 01:40:05,393
l believe Abbas
has taken after her.

1528
01:40:05,804 --> 01:40:06,793
Sir...

1529
01:40:07,172 --> 01:40:09,367
don't you think we should convey...

1530
01:40:09,441 --> 01:40:12,103
Zohra's regards to
Madhumati right now?

1531
01:40:13,244 --> 01:40:14,233
At her house?

1532
01:40:14,813 --> 01:40:16,212
Oh no, she must be asleep.

1533
01:40:17,082 --> 01:40:18,549
But Sania will be awake.

1534
01:40:20,919 --> 01:40:21,908
Let's go!

1535
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:28,225
Prithviji's hand was almost here.

1536
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:30,951
You were saved by a whisker, Abbas.

1537
01:40:31,129 --> 01:40:32,494
Actually, l was saved.

1538
01:40:33,164 --> 01:40:36,258
With my hairy legs exposed,
l thought all of us would be exposed.

1539
01:40:37,369 --> 01:40:38,768
- Abhishek.
- Who is it?

1540
01:40:40,005 --> 01:40:40,994
Abhishek.

1541
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:42,729
- Your moustache!
- They are here.

1542
01:40:42,874 --> 01:40:43,863
Put on your moustache.

1543
01:40:45,276 --> 01:40:46,300
Two double centuries!

1544
01:40:54,819 --> 01:40:56,480
Prithviji,
didn't l tell you that...

1545
01:40:57,022 --> 01:40:59,286
'lt's not good to
visit someone so often.

1546
01:40:59,991 --> 01:41:01,219
lt lowers their respect.'

1547
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,088
Oh no!

1548
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:05,288
We are here to see your mother.

1549
01:41:05,497 --> 01:41:06,395
We need to talk to her.

1550
01:41:06,464 --> 01:41:08,864
Well...
She is taking a bath.

1551
01:41:10,969 --> 01:41:13,460
- Let's come back some other time,
Maakhan... - Sir, the message...

1552
01:41:13,872 --> 01:41:15,237
and it doesn't
take long for a bath.

1553
01:41:15,607 --> 01:41:17,404
Sania is also here...

1554
01:41:18,443 --> 01:41:19,569
to get us coffee.

1555
01:41:20,045 --> 01:41:21,808
Sania, may we come in?

1556
01:41:33,124 --> 01:41:35,149
Ravi, Sania...

1557
01:41:36,661 --> 01:41:40,222
in the last act of our play, the
liars should be severely punished.

1558
01:41:44,235 --> 01:41:46,829
'Honesty is the
best mutual policy!'

1559
01:41:48,873 --> 01:41:50,340
- Wow!
- That reminds me...

1560
01:41:51,743 --> 01:41:53,176
where is Abhishek Bachchan?

1561
01:41:57,949 --> 01:42:00,349
Same thing... temple... bell...

1562
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:02,809
old fashioned guy.

1563
01:42:03,354 --> 01:42:04,582
Mark my words...

1564
01:42:04,656 --> 01:42:07,819
some day this drama will fall
apart and the truth will be out.

1565
01:42:10,361 --> 01:42:15,765
Sir has placed his trust in you and
you are carrying on with the lies.

1566
01:42:15,967 --> 01:42:17,127
- When Sir...
- Sir?

1567
01:42:18,603 --> 01:42:19,695
Shastri...

1568
01:42:21,072 --> 01:42:23,768
l know everything
about their drama.

1569
01:42:25,777 --> 01:42:30,305
The Aflatoon drama company
is practicing very sincerely.

1570
01:42:30,815 --> 01:42:31,747
Of course!

1571
01:42:31,816 --> 01:42:32,805
Sania too.

1572
01:42:34,919 --> 01:42:36,352
l've invested at the right place.

1573
01:42:36,421 --> 01:42:37,979
They won't break my trust.

1574
01:42:38,389 --> 01:42:41,051
That's very kind of you!
Hail Prithviji!

1575
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:50,259
- lt's too late now, we'll leave.
- Yes please.

1576
01:42:50,335 --> 01:42:51,859
Sir... mother?

1577
01:42:58,243 --> 01:43:00,711
By now even the pipes
would have run out of water!

1578
01:43:00,879 --> 01:43:02,403
We could have some more coffee.

1579
01:43:02,714 --> 01:43:04,682
Sania, you can
get us coffee, right?

1580
01:43:08,953 --> 01:43:10,921
Hey! Why are you crying?

1581
01:43:11,089 --> 01:43:13,216
Actually...
we are out of coffee.

1582
01:43:13,358 --> 01:43:14,985
Now what can we get for you?

1583
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,424
Out of coffee? No problem.
Tea will do.

1584
01:43:19,864 --> 01:43:22,094
The fatso wants tea.

1585
01:43:23,268 --> 01:43:25,702
Give him tea and
give me some poison!

1586
01:43:25,937 --> 01:43:27,928
What do we do now?
We're doomed!

1587
01:43:28,406 --> 01:43:30,067
Sania dear, who's out there?

1588
01:43:36,114 --> 01:43:37,513
Hello Prithviji.

1589
01:43:40,485 --> 01:43:41,782
Mother...

1590
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:43,709
mother is here!

1591
01:43:44,455 --> 01:43:47,015
There is no tea,
but mother is here.

1592
01:43:48,059 --> 01:43:49,048
Wait a minute!

1593
01:43:49,294 --> 01:43:52,752
Shastriji just stepped out
the bathroom over there and...

1594
01:43:53,531 --> 01:43:55,829
mother also came out from there?

1595
01:43:56,134 --> 01:43:57,123
How?

1596
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:59,859
How?

1597
01:44:01,005 --> 01:44:03,530
When you can have two
identical sons at home...

1598
01:44:03,942 --> 01:44:06,376
can you not have
identical bathrooms?

1599
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,943
My sister, Zohra, called me.

1600
01:44:11,249 --> 01:44:12,216
Zohra?

1601
01:44:12,283 --> 01:44:14,080
You misbehaved with her?

1602
01:44:15,019 --> 01:44:16,953
You actually look like a scoundrel.

1603
01:44:17,121 --> 01:44:17,780
Huh?

1604
01:44:17,856 --> 01:44:19,153
- And you too...
- What?

1605
01:44:19,357 --> 01:44:20,824
Unbelievable!

1606
01:44:21,192 --> 01:44:22,887
You believed his words?

1607
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:28,729
l am very sorry.

1608
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,097
Oh no, Prithviji.

1609
01:44:31,102 --> 01:44:32,000
We'll leave now.

1610
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:33,298
Oh no, Prithviji.

1611
01:44:33,371 --> 01:44:34,360
Prithviji...

1612
01:44:35,406 --> 01:44:37,931
Zohraji, what brings you here?

1613
01:44:38,276 --> 01:44:40,369
And your sister, Zohra?

1614
01:44:40,778 --> 01:44:42,405
l'll explain everything.

1615
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:47,813
No problem,
Prithviji, it will be done.

1616
01:44:48,152 --> 01:44:50,518
We'll have to set the
boundary line of the...

1617
01:44:50,755 --> 01:44:52,279
Deteron power plant
further by 150 yards.

1618
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:55,025
Prithviji, l'd appreciate...

1619
01:44:55,093 --> 01:44:57,254
if l could get the documents
regarding the land and the plant.

1620
01:44:57,328 --> 01:44:58,124
Yes, yes.

1621
01:44:58,196 --> 01:44:59,185
- Shastriji...
- Yes, sir.

1622
01:44:59,264 --> 01:45:00,891
Give Akhileshji all that he wants.

1623
01:45:00,965 --> 01:45:01,363
Yes.

1624
01:45:01,432 --> 01:45:03,400
'ASAP-QRS!'

1625
01:45:03,801 --> 01:45:05,860
Yes, sir. Got it.

1626
01:45:08,806 --> 01:45:11,274
And out in the distance,
Prithviji, the greenery...

1627
01:45:18,016 --> 01:45:22,077
Forget the greenery,
look what's blooming out there!

1628
01:45:24,355 --> 01:45:25,788
Open free show!

1629
01:45:26,557 --> 01:45:27,421
Vinay!

1630
01:45:27,492 --> 01:45:29,426
'Dhim Phataphat Jhingdi Popo!'

1631
01:45:29,861 --> 01:45:31,385
Dhim Phataphat Jhingdi Popo?

1632
01:45:31,462 --> 01:45:32,326
Yes.

1633
01:45:32,397 --> 01:45:38,393
l mean, two people in
love under ajasmine tree.

1634
01:45:38,536 --> 01:45:41,300
Let me take a look...
Under a Jasmine tree...

1635
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:43,829
Oh no!

1636
01:45:45,143 --> 01:45:46,132
Shastri...

1637
01:45:47,045 --> 01:45:48,103
What did he see?

1638
01:45:52,817 --> 01:45:53,579
Sir!

1639
01:45:53,818 --> 01:45:55,285
Sir, look!

1640
01:45:57,121 --> 01:45:58,520
Yes look!

1641
01:45:58,589 --> 01:46:00,523
Ranakpur is on
the road to progress.

1642
01:46:00,591 --> 01:46:01,853
Prithviji, take a look.

1643
01:46:11,302 --> 01:46:15,602
'Dhim Phataphat Jhingdi Popo!'

1644
01:46:29,754 --> 01:46:30,743
Brother...

1645
01:46:31,556 --> 01:46:33,148
l...
l really like him.

1646
01:46:35,259 --> 01:46:38,660
And before you lecture me about our
family honor and social status...

1647
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:40,595
Those things don't matter...

1648
01:46:41,566 --> 01:46:43,557
what matters is the 'in-between'.

1649
01:46:43,668 --> 01:46:47,104
ln between?
He always stands on one side.

1650
01:46:47,305 --> 01:46:50,035
Radhika, you cannot
be with him because he is...

1651
01:46:50,174 --> 01:46:51,163
He is?

1652
01:46:51,909 --> 01:46:53,934
What, brother!
Which era are you living in?

1653
01:46:54,579 --> 01:46:56,308
People of my generation
don't mind such things.

1654
01:46:56,881 --> 01:46:59,247
l mean, look at out superstars,
cricketers...

1655
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:01,743
even our local collector is one.

1656
01:47:01,986 --> 01:47:02,975
What?

1657
01:47:03,087 --> 01:47:05,612
What are you talking about?
Are you alright?

1658
01:47:06,357 --> 01:47:07,984
They are the same.

1659
01:47:08,359 --> 01:47:12,056
Shahrukh Khan, Zaheer Khan,
Javed Akhtar, Salman Khan...

1660
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:14,821
even our ex-President,
Abdul Kalaam Azaad too!

1661
01:47:16,234 --> 01:47:19,692
l didn't know that.

1662
01:47:19,871 --> 01:47:21,099
Well now you do!

1663
01:47:21,572 --> 01:47:22,596
Decide for yourself!

1664
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,364
lf people practicing
the same faith as...

1665
01:47:24,609 --> 01:47:26,941
Abbas can be in every field of life
then why not in my life?

1666
01:47:27,011 --> 01:47:27,875
Oh no!

1667
01:47:27,945 --> 01:47:29,105
l'm not talking about faith...

1668
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,875
l'm talking about
their persuasion...

1669
01:47:30,948 --> 01:47:32,848
By persuasion even
you are the same.

1670
01:47:33,684 --> 01:47:35,208
Honest and just.

1671
01:47:35,286 --> 01:47:37,345
- But...
- Please, brother. Please!

1672
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:40,987
She won't get it!

1673
01:47:42,226 --> 01:47:45,889
l guess l'll have
to tell Abbas myself!

1674
01:47:46,998 --> 01:47:47,965
Prithviji, you called for me.

1675
01:47:48,032 --> 01:47:49,431
Abhishek!

1676
01:47:50,101 --> 01:47:54,094
Tell your brother to stay
away from my sister, otherwise...

1677
01:47:59,143 --> 01:48:03,375
l respect you and your mother,
otherwise...

1678
01:48:07,418 --> 01:48:08,976
Tell your brother...

1679
01:48:10,088 --> 01:48:12,215
l'll give him a dog's death!

1680
01:48:15,293 --> 01:48:18,660
'Brother-in-law will
die Tommy's death!'

1681
01:48:26,037 --> 01:48:28,301
l will talk to him, Prithviji.

1682
01:48:29,273 --> 01:48:30,262
l'll leave now.

1683
01:48:35,379 --> 01:48:38,940
You didn't get it,
but he will explain it to him.

1684
01:48:40,151 --> 01:48:42,278
lf he still doesn't
get it straight...

1685
01:48:43,121 --> 01:48:45,419
l'll make sure to lay
him straight for good!

1686
01:48:48,926 --> 01:48:49,893
Over!

1687
01:48:49,961 --> 01:48:50,985
lt's all over!

1688
01:48:51,662 --> 01:48:53,789
Your brother gave
himself two names.

1689
01:48:54,198 --> 01:48:57,759
Now Prithviji will make
two separate pieces of him.

1690
01:48:58,069 --> 01:48:59,798
This was bound to
happen to you, Abbas.

1691
01:49:00,104 --> 01:49:02,163
As you sow, so shall you reap!

1692
01:49:03,174 --> 01:49:04,835
What are you talking about, Ravi?

1693
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:08,804
You knew that Prithvi hates lies.

1694
01:49:08,913 --> 01:49:12,371
You fear him,
yet its one lie after another.

1695
01:49:12,783 --> 01:49:14,478
What are you trying to say?

1696
01:49:15,219 --> 01:49:16,686
You lie about each
and everything and...

1697
01:49:16,754 --> 01:49:18,813
now you are lecturing
me about being truthful?

1698
01:49:19,223 --> 01:49:21,316
You started it with the
fake Abhishek Bachchan name!

1699
01:49:21,392 --> 01:49:23,485
But you came up with the
reason how you got that name.

1700
01:49:23,728 --> 01:49:25,161
You fake mother was your idea.

1701
01:49:25,396 --> 01:49:27,887
And the 'nanny' and 'maid
mother' concept was yours!

1702
01:49:27,965 --> 01:49:29,728
You got rid of my moustache!

1703
01:49:30,034 --> 01:49:33,094
You conned Prithviji
with the moustache idea.

1704
01:49:33,504 --> 01:49:36,530
You also used this dirty,
fake moustache.

1705
01:49:36,974 --> 01:49:38,771
The fact is...

1706
01:49:39,076 --> 01:49:40,441
now l am scared as hell!

1707
01:49:42,713 --> 01:49:43,702
Abbas...

1708
01:49:43,948 --> 01:49:46,439
l agree that l am
responsible for your lies.

1709
01:49:47,084 --> 01:49:50,918
And l also know that
now l will die a dog's death!

1710
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:53,479
Father!

1711
01:49:53,925 --> 01:49:54,983
Father? Where is father?

1712
01:49:55,059 --> 01:49:56,287
l'm calling out to you!

1713
01:49:57,995 --> 01:50:00,225
Please save this
little boy of yours.

1714
01:50:00,965 --> 01:50:02,091
l love you.

1715
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:04,029
Get lost! What love!

1716
01:50:04,168 --> 01:50:05,726
Please save me, father.

1717
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:08,031
Keep me safe in your arms.

1718
01:50:09,173 --> 01:50:10,333
Abbas, my friend...

1719
01:50:10,408 --> 01:50:12,000
only you can make things right.

1720
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:13,541
And you will have to do it!

1721
01:50:15,813 --> 01:50:16,780
Radhika?

1722
01:50:16,847 --> 01:50:17,973
l'm going to Raajgadh.

1723
01:50:18,115 --> 01:50:19,309
For the country fair?

1724
01:50:19,984 --> 01:50:22,111
My brother has ordered
me to break up with you.

1725
01:50:22,286 --> 01:50:24,379
But l want to be with
you for the rest of my life!

1726
01:50:24,822 --> 01:50:26,312
That's why l'm giving you two days.

1727
01:50:26,591 --> 01:50:28,821
l want you to solve all
the problems with my brother...

1728
01:50:28,993 --> 01:50:30,255
and then come to
Raajgadh to get me.

1729
01:50:30,328 --> 01:50:31,420
l will send you the address.

1730
01:50:31,529 --> 01:50:33,963
- But you only have two days,
otherwise... - Wait a minute!

1731
01:50:34,465 --> 01:50:37,298
What's with the time limit...
this attitude?

1732
01:50:37,802 --> 01:50:38,769
What have l done?

1733
01:50:38,836 --> 01:50:39,962
'Bundle of Lies!'

1734
01:50:40,037 --> 01:50:42,505
From dawn to dusk, you keep spinning
my brother in a bundle of lies!

1735
01:50:43,307 --> 01:50:45,605
Abhishek Bachchan,
l want Abbas back in two days!

1736
01:50:46,444 --> 01:50:47,433
Bye.

1737
01:50:55,386 --> 01:50:56,717
Unbelievable!

1738
01:51:00,124 --> 01:51:01,785
The brother wants Abbas
out of the way and...

1739
01:51:01,859 --> 01:51:03,451
the sister wants Abhishek
Bachchan out of the way!

1740
01:51:03,961 --> 01:51:06,486
Both of them have
turned me into a drum.

1741
01:51:07,965 --> 01:51:09,159
Abbas, l'm leaving.

1742
01:51:09,367 --> 01:51:11,232
Radhika, stop behaving
like a child and come back.

1743
01:51:11,302 --> 01:51:12,428
l will do as l have said.

1744
01:51:14,305 --> 01:51:15,932
ln fact, l made it to the bus.

1745
01:51:16,073 --> 01:51:17,370
Radhika, don't be foolish.

1746
01:51:17,675 --> 01:51:19,006
lf your brother finds out...

1747
01:51:26,117 --> 01:51:27,277
Abbas at home?

1748
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,182
No.

1749
01:51:30,254 --> 01:51:32,188
So my suspicion was right.

1750
01:51:33,157 --> 01:51:34,146
Suspicion?

1751
01:51:34,292 --> 01:51:36,817
Radhika is missing since morning
and Abbas is not here either.

1752
01:51:37,862 --> 01:51:39,955
Your brother has
run away with my sister.

1753
01:51:40,298 --> 01:51:42,232
How can you say that, Prithviji?
l am here...

1754
01:51:44,302 --> 01:51:46,236
l mean, as long as l'm here...

1755
01:51:46,304 --> 01:51:47,999
my brother will never
take such a step.

1756
01:51:48,072 --> 01:51:49,403
Then where is Radhika?

1757
01:51:54,845 --> 01:51:58,110
Cousin, you're looking
for Radhika, right?

1758
01:51:58,549 --> 01:52:00,847
She is going to Raajgadh by bus.

1759
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:04,311
But the Dharampur
bus depot is on the way.

1760
01:52:04,989 --> 01:52:08,220
And Kherwada is ten
minutes away from Dharampur.

1761
01:52:08,993 --> 01:52:12,156
Whereas Ranakpur
is 30 minutes away.

1762
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:14,796
l'd like to see how you'll cover...

1763
01:52:14,999 --> 01:52:17,058
a distance of 30
minutes in ten minutes!

1764
01:52:32,283 --> 01:52:34,979
The passengers can freshen up, the
bus will halt here for some time.

1765
01:52:35,052 --> 01:52:36,041
Come on...

1766
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:54,333
Everybody out of the bus, now!

1767
01:52:59,577 --> 01:53:00,566
Move it!

1768
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:07,239
Get down!

1769
01:53:07,385 --> 01:53:08,545
Everybody out!

1770
01:53:18,095 --> 01:53:19,392
Cousin Prithvi...

1771
01:53:21,832 --> 01:53:23,060
Get down.

1772
01:53:27,338 --> 01:53:28,566
Abbas!

1773
01:53:32,376 --> 01:53:33,400
Prithviji!

1774
01:53:35,346 --> 01:53:36,506
Bhawani start the bus.

1775
01:53:37,882 --> 01:53:39,008
Brother!

1776
01:55:58,522 --> 01:55:59,045
Leave...

1777
01:55:59,123 --> 01:56:00,112
Prithviji...

1778
01:56:00,424 --> 01:56:01,482
Hold on, Prithviji.

1779
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:03,891
You can't fight blood with blood!

1780
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:06,585
Come on.

1781
01:56:08,132 --> 01:56:11,465
l warned you never
to step out of Ranakpur.

1782
01:56:11,735 --> 01:56:13,726
But you were running
away from home, from Ranakpur.

1783
01:56:13,871 --> 01:56:14,769
And for whom?

1784
01:56:14,838 --> 01:56:16,635
That idiot who abandoned you?

1785
01:56:18,409 --> 01:56:20,570
What do you think, Abhishek?
Did l say something wrong?

1786
01:56:21,512 --> 01:56:22,979
You are absolutely right,
Prithviji.

1787
01:56:23,047 --> 01:56:26,175
Radhika, a real man doesn't
run away from problems...

1788
01:56:26,417 --> 01:56:27,645
but he faces them head on.

1789
01:56:27,785 --> 01:56:29,184
- Right, Prithviji?
- Yes.

1790
01:56:29,787 --> 01:56:31,220
A real man doesn't care
about his own life but...

1791
01:56:31,488 --> 01:56:32,853
puts his own life in
danger for his loved ones.

1792
01:56:32,957 --> 01:56:34,515
- Right, Prithviji?
- Yes.

1793
01:56:34,692 --> 01:56:37,627
You should look for a life partner
who will protect you every minute...

1794
01:56:37,695 --> 01:56:38,684
just like l did.

1795
01:56:38,762 --> 01:56:39,990
- Right, Prithviji?
- Yes.

1796
01:56:42,499 --> 01:56:43,761
- Abhishek?
- Yes, Prithviji?

1797
01:56:44,435 --> 01:56:45,697
You are absolutely right!

1798
01:56:46,203 --> 01:56:48,137
Searching the whole town
and finding him right beside.

1799
01:56:48,572 --> 01:56:51,063
'Boy under armpit and
hypercity noise pollution!'

1800
01:56:51,675 --> 01:56:52,141
What?

1801
01:56:52,209 --> 01:56:55,474
Abhishek, do you like Radhika?

1802
01:56:56,981 --> 01:56:58,209
- do l like Radhika?
- Wow!

1803
01:56:58,616 --> 01:57:00,948
You like Radhika!
Radhika, do you like Abhishek?

1804
01:57:01,685 --> 01:57:02,674
Yes, brother.

1805
01:57:02,853 --> 01:57:04,514
You opened my eyes!

1806
01:57:04,722 --> 01:57:06,986
A real man doesn't
run away from problems...

1807
01:57:08,792 --> 01:57:10,487
A real man doesn't care
about his own life but...

1808
01:57:10,561 --> 01:57:11,755
''puts his own life in

1809
01:57:11,862 --> 01:57:13,227
l'm willing to marry him.

1810
01:57:13,497 --> 01:57:14,691
Oh no! l can't get married.

1811
01:57:14,932 --> 01:57:15,921
Why not?

1812
01:57:16,166 --> 01:57:17,497
lt's a personal problem.

1813
01:57:24,808 --> 01:57:27,038
Don't worry,
medicines are available these days.

1814
01:57:27,211 --> 01:57:29,179
- And there are clinics everywhere.
- Prithviji!

1815
01:57:30,214 --> 01:57:31,806
l can't get married because...

1816
01:57:32,249 --> 01:57:35,616
when my sister is unmarried,
how can l get married?

1817
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,153
You also have an unmarried sister.

1818
01:57:39,923 --> 01:57:41,982
Until she doesn't get married,
how can you get married?

1819
01:57:46,563 --> 01:57:49,259
Actually, l'm here to talk
about bringing our families closer.

1820
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,563
- But Prithviji...
- Abhishek...

1821
01:57:52,169 --> 01:57:54,865
When elders are talking,
the young shouldn't interrupt.

1822
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,032
'When elder get cozy,
younger don't put nosy.'

1823
01:57:59,543 --> 01:58:00,908
Right!

1824
01:58:02,813 --> 01:58:06,044
So, what do you have
to say about marriage?

1825
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:10,619
l never thought about it.

1826
01:58:12,022 --> 01:58:13,114
l understand.

1827
01:58:13,857 --> 01:58:16,018
Looking after the kids
and offering prayers to God...

1828
01:58:16,527 --> 01:58:17,516
l don't think you had time to...

1829
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:22,698
think about Sania and my marriage.

1830
01:58:24,568 --> 01:58:26,627
lf l have your permission...

1831
01:58:26,704 --> 01:58:27,693
Permission?

1832
01:58:27,938 --> 01:58:29,997
Permission from Madhumati?

1833
01:58:30,808 --> 01:58:35,711
To marry an honest and
just man like you, l'd jump...

1834
01:58:37,881 --> 01:58:40,145
right into the preparations.

1835
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:45,588
What do you think you're saying?

1836
01:58:45,656 --> 01:58:46,918
Silence!
Didn't you hear...

1837
01:58:47,124 --> 01:58:49,649
When elder get cozy,
younger don't put nosy.

1838
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:54,156
Prithviji, l think you should get
married to Sania at the earliest.

1839
01:58:54,364 --> 01:58:56,594
You better decide
on the wedding date soon.

1840
01:58:57,101 --> 01:58:58,090
Wow!

1841
01:58:58,335 --> 01:58:59,962
Thank you.

1842
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:03,829
Listen...

1843
01:59:07,945 --> 01:59:12,279
now two brother's will be busy
preparing their sister's marriage.

1844
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:15,851
'A brother in need
is a sister indeed.'

1845
01:59:18,889 --> 01:59:21,949
Why did you have to
agree to the marriage?

1846
01:59:22,259 --> 01:59:25,922
ldiot, how can anyone
decline to such a match?

1847
01:59:27,631 --> 01:59:29,360
The minute Prithviji
realizes that...

1848
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:32,596
he is not marrying Sania
Bachchan but Sania Ali...

1849
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:34,264
he will shoot all of us!

1850
01:59:34,338 --> 01:59:35,771
Absolutely!
Finally!

1851
01:59:35,873 --> 01:59:37,340
Finally, you spoke the truth.

1852
01:59:37,407 --> 01:59:39,034
Prithviji will shoot all of us.

1853
01:59:39,276 --> 01:59:40,402
We are doomed!

1854
01:59:40,778 --> 01:59:42,905
Why don't you make
Sania wear a moustache...

1855
01:59:43,113 --> 01:59:46,742
and tell Prithviji that he
had seen Sania's sister, Dhaniya!

1856
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:50,019
You can change you get-up
and say you are Govinda!

1857
01:59:50,354 --> 01:59:52,151
And l will say, l'm not Shastri...

1858
01:59:52,222 --> 01:59:53,883
but ajailor from the British era!

1859
01:59:53,957 --> 01:59:54,946
Ha ha!

1860
01:59:56,093 --> 01:59:58,391
How much are you eating, Hari?

1861
01:59:58,796 --> 02:00:00,161
You should save
some for the country!

1862
02:00:00,297 --> 02:00:01,423
When you go back to your village...

1863
02:00:01,665 --> 02:00:02,893
they'll think of
you as another village.

1864
02:00:02,966 --> 02:00:04,456
Sir...
Saniaji.

1865
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:20,574
Prithviji...

1866
02:00:21,218 --> 02:00:24,119
Sorry, but l can't marry you.

1867
02:00:25,989 --> 02:00:28,617
No girl will reject
your proposal but...

1868
02:00:29,326 --> 02:00:34,821
l can't marry you
for a personal reason.

1869
02:00:38,936 --> 02:00:39,925
And...

1870
02:00:41,271 --> 02:00:43,671
l had a personal reason
for wanting to marry you.

1871
02:01:02,759 --> 02:01:03,748
She is...

1872
02:01:05,395 --> 02:01:08,091
Even l was shocked
when l first saw you.

1873
02:01:12,669 --> 02:01:13,829
She is Apeksa.

1874
02:01:15,005 --> 02:01:16,199
l loved her a lot.

1875
02:01:17,875 --> 02:01:20,935
Four years ago she
passed away in an accident.

1876
02:01:23,247 --> 02:01:27,843
She is no longer alive
and all l have is this picture.

1877
02:01:30,187 --> 02:01:31,677
Radhika doesn't know about her.

1878
02:01:34,391 --> 02:01:36,256
After Apeksa passed away...

1879
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:39,424
l had no reason to live.

1880
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:43,098
l devoted myself to
the progress of Ranakpur.

1881
02:01:45,135 --> 02:01:50,437
And when l saw you
l thought Apeksa was back.

1882
02:01:52,743 --> 02:01:57,407
l forgot that you aren't
Apeksa but Sania Bachchan.

1883
02:01:58,181 --> 02:02:01,014
'Bloody fool got emotional.'

1884
02:02:04,087 --> 02:02:06,112
Please forgive me...

1885
02:02:07,891 --> 02:02:11,122
without asking you l came
to your place with the proposal.

1886
02:02:14,164 --> 02:02:15,631
Anyway, it happens.

1887
02:02:15,732 --> 02:02:17,427
Happens only in lndia.

1888
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:20,996
But l am happy that...

1889
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:24,298
my sister is getting
married into your family.

1890
02:02:25,776 --> 02:02:28,244
Abhishek is a good boy.

1891
02:02:28,845 --> 02:02:30,403
Strong, honest.

1892
02:02:32,082 --> 02:02:33,140
l am happy.

1893
02:02:34,217 --> 02:02:35,241
l am very happy.

1894
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:37,878
l am very happy.

1895
02:03:04,181 --> 02:03:05,170
Abhishek...

1896
02:03:06,483 --> 02:03:07,677
See you tomorrow.

1897
02:03:07,784 --> 02:03:09,615
You better remember to wake up!

1898
02:03:10,687 --> 02:03:11,676
Let's go.

1899
02:03:15,625 --> 02:03:16,683
What's the matter?

1900
02:03:17,761 --> 02:03:19,251
Abbas, we made a big mistake.

1901
02:03:20,130 --> 02:03:21,119
Very big!

1902
02:03:22,332 --> 02:03:26,530
We are cheating the very person
who has helped us in every way.

1903
02:03:26,603 --> 02:03:27,729
Every possible way.

1904
02:03:29,539 --> 02:03:31,302
He is so honest and down-to-earth.

1905
02:03:32,676 --> 02:03:36,874
When he figures that Abbas and
Abhishek are one and the same...

1906
02:03:39,216 --> 02:03:40,615
You had said...

1907
02:03:41,218 --> 02:03:42,776
if l work with honor...

1908
02:03:43,053 --> 02:03:45,078
''neither will Allah take offence,

1909
02:03:45,155 --> 02:03:46,520
nor will Lord Ram.''

1910
02:03:46,823 --> 02:03:48,984
But lying to such a nice person...

1911
02:03:49,693 --> 02:03:52,253
will hurt Gods of every
faith in this world!

1912
02:04:24,594 --> 02:04:26,585
Sir...

1913
02:04:32,269 --> 02:04:33,634
Have you lost it?

1914
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:35,961
Yes, sir!
All because of happiness.

1915
02:04:36,973 --> 02:04:40,272
Sir, please deliver Gabbar
Singh's legendary dialogue.

1916
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:41,167
What?

1917
02:04:41,244 --> 02:04:42,233
Please!

1918
02:04:42,979 --> 02:04:44,139
How many were there?

1919
02:04:44,815 --> 02:04:46,544
Not two, but one!

1920
02:04:46,616 --> 02:04:47,207
What?

1921
02:04:47,284 --> 02:04:49,684
l mean, there's only one!

1922
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:11,302
Sania is right.

1923
02:05:12,976 --> 02:05:14,944
l will go and confess
everything to Prithviji.

1924
02:05:15,112 --> 02:05:16,079
What?

1925
02:05:16,146 --> 02:05:18,273
Have you lost your mind?

1926
02:05:18,348 --> 02:05:19,337
Shastriji.

1927
02:05:21,017 --> 02:05:23,315
Prithviji has called the
entire family to the mansion.

1928
02:05:36,733 --> 02:05:38,826
Welcome Abhishek Bachchan.

1929
02:05:40,604 --> 02:05:42,333
Greetings mother.

1930
02:05:42,606 --> 02:05:43,595
Greetings.

1931
02:05:44,875 --> 02:05:46,843
Prithviji,
why did you call us here?

1932
02:05:49,312 --> 02:05:50,108
Well, l...

1933
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:52,375
Prithviji, l'm glad you
asked all of us to come here.

1934
02:05:57,154 --> 02:05:59,247
Prithviji, we have something to...

1935
02:05:59,322 --> 02:06:01,256
But before that,
let me tell you that...

1936
02:06:04,194 --> 02:06:09,097
l have made some
changes in the play.

1937
02:06:09,966 --> 02:06:12,059
Please take your seat.

1938
02:06:12,936 --> 02:06:15,666
l want to see
everyone's expressions.

1939
02:06:15,739 --> 02:06:19,266
'l wanting to watchman
all your express highways.'

1940
02:06:23,346 --> 02:06:24,335
lnteresting!

1941
02:06:25,615 --> 02:06:28,140
Now this muscle-brain
will make changes in the play!

1942
02:06:28,852 --> 02:06:30,285
This always happens in our field.

1943
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:32,087
Once a person becomes a producer...

1944
02:06:32,189 --> 02:06:33,952
he forces himself into
the creative aspect too!

1945
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:42,291
Such waves,
such seasons, such times...

1946
02:06:42,666 --> 02:06:47,933
Once there was a
King and his minister...

1947
02:06:52,709 --> 02:06:57,442
He was Janakpur's ruler,
King Rishiraj Raghuvanshi.

1948
02:06:59,049 --> 02:07:04,146
And his loyal confidante,
General Bol Bachchan.

1949
02:07:08,792 --> 02:07:10,350
Bol Bachchan...

1950
02:07:10,961 --> 02:07:14,453
you've been looking after the
royal treasury for many months now.

1951
02:07:14,764 --> 02:07:17,699
Rishirajji, my father would say...

1952
02:07:17,968 --> 02:07:24,237
''Salt increases blood pressure, and

1953
02:07:24,441 --> 02:07:25,430
Brilliant!

1954
02:07:25,742 --> 02:07:26,731
Brilliant!

1955
02:07:26,977 --> 02:07:30,208
When the son is so good,
how will the mother be?

1956
02:07:31,147 --> 02:07:32,136
Mother...

1957
02:07:32,215 --> 02:07:35,207
The Lord is great.
Pray to the Lord.

1958
02:07:35,352 --> 02:07:37,183
Hari Om!

1959
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,919
Greetings Rishirajji.

1960
02:07:39,155 --> 02:07:41,248
Greetings mother.

1961
02:07:42,225 --> 02:07:47,720
And this is Janakpur's mad man,
Uncle Mistri.

1962
02:07:48,098 --> 02:07:53,001
Mother isn't here.

1963
02:07:54,738 --> 02:07:59,971
One day the King took
a ride around his kingdom...

1964
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:05,241
And he saw his minister...

1965
02:08:05,382 --> 02:08:08,749
People were celebrating Eid...

1966
02:08:08,818 --> 02:08:10,809
What a sight it was...

1967
02:08:11,054 --> 02:08:16,151
Once there was a
King and his minister...

1968
02:08:22,198 --> 02:08:23,665
l'm not Bol Bachchan...

1969
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:26,769
l'm his dancer brother,
Abba Dabba Jabba.

1970
02:08:28,071 --> 02:08:32,405
And my mother also has
an identical sister, Mohra.

1971
02:08:32,842 --> 02:08:33,934
Take a look.

1972
02:08:36,346 --> 02:08:37,335
Greetings.

1973
02:08:37,914 --> 02:08:41,748
l'm a delicate bud, let me bloom.

1974
02:08:42,185 --> 02:08:46,849
l'm A R Rahman's new song,
let me grow on you!

1975
02:08:50,794 --> 02:08:55,356
Mother isn't here.

1976
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,462
Today was unbelievable,
wasn't it, Sabu?

1977
02:09:08,978 --> 02:09:09,967
Father!

1978
02:09:10,714 --> 02:09:13,410
Rishirajji, my father would say...

1979
02:09:15,051 --> 02:09:17,713
The Lord is great.

1980
02:09:18,488 --> 02:09:21,218
Hari Om!

1981
02:09:21,391 --> 02:09:25,191
Starting today l'll
observe a fast everyday.

1982
02:09:25,495 --> 02:09:29,761
This old age is a gift
from my youth, Rishirajji.

1983
02:09:31,434 --> 02:09:42,709
And so the King was fooled...

1984
02:10:00,397 --> 02:10:02,024
All of you fooled me.

1985
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,867
And l got fooled!

1986
02:10:06,202 --> 02:10:08,170
l believed every
lie to be the truth.

1987
02:10:10,173 --> 02:10:12,403
l'm muscle-brain, so...

1988
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:17,244
l don't think with my mind,
but with my heart.

1989
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:22,211
l respected the
uncle as an uncle...

1990
02:10:24,487 --> 02:10:26,148
l considered mother as a mother...

1991
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:32,792
l kept all of you
close to my heart...

1992
02:10:35,999 --> 02:10:37,967
because l don't
think with my mind...

1993
02:10:43,973 --> 02:10:45,964
but not anymore.

1994
02:10:48,578 --> 02:10:51,809
You've trampled my heart,
ripped it, broken it.

1995
02:10:52,248 --> 02:10:54,409
And now the mighty
Prithviraj Raghuvanshi...

1996
02:10:54,484 --> 02:10:57,146
will break your bones!

1997
02:10:57,587 --> 02:11:00,385
'l will put the last
nail polish in the coffin!'

1998
02:11:00,457 --> 02:11:01,981
Because...

1999
02:11:02,325 --> 02:11:04,987
Now l've lost it!

2000
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:08,019
Wait a minute!

2001
02:11:08,431 --> 02:11:10,023
Actually,
this has been a miscalculation...

2002
02:11:10,099 --> 02:11:11,157
misconception, misapplication...

2003
02:11:11,234 --> 02:11:12,496
misapprehension, misinterpretation.

2004
02:11:12,602 --> 02:11:14,832
This is supercalifragilisti
cexpialidocious!

2005
02:11:17,106 --> 02:11:18,095
Radhika!

2006
02:11:36,993 --> 02:11:39,018
Abbas, Prithviji is here!

2007
02:11:47,437 --> 02:11:48,529
What will happen now?

2008
02:11:48,972 --> 02:11:50,439
Prithviji won't spare us!

2009
02:12:20,336 --> 02:12:21,325
Abbas!

2010
02:13:19,762 --> 02:13:21,354
Faster! Faster!
Step on it!

2011
02:13:24,867 --> 02:13:27,301
Prithviji is back again.
He is right behind us.

2012
02:13:31,541 --> 02:13:34,009
Stop the car!
Let's run for our lives!

2013
02:13:40,883 --> 02:13:41,941
Father!

2014
02:13:43,353 --> 02:13:44,684
Be careful!

2015
02:13:48,091 --> 02:13:49,558
Abbas!

2016
02:14:39,075 --> 02:14:40,064
Brother!

2017
02:14:44,013 --> 02:14:45,002
Sir!

2018
02:14:45,648 --> 02:14:46,774
- Prithviji!
- Brother!

2019
02:14:46,883 --> 02:14:48,783
Sir!

2020
02:14:50,586 --> 02:14:53,020
- Someone help sir.
- Help!

2021
02:14:53,156 --> 02:14:54,680
Abbas, all this is
only because of you.

2022
02:14:54,824 --> 02:14:56,792
Listen Abbas...
you will save my boss.

2023
02:14:57,126 --> 02:14:58,423
- Me?
- Yes!

2024
02:14:58,628 --> 02:15:00,095
Have you seen how
deep the ravine is?

2025
02:15:00,396 --> 02:15:02,626
The more l climb down,
the more l'll be closer to heaven.

2026
02:15:02,765 --> 02:15:03,697
- Abbas! - Yes?

2027
02:15:03,766 --> 02:15:06,735
All that Prithviji is going through
is only because of your lie.

2028
02:15:07,036 --> 02:15:08,867
When did it change
from 'our lie' to 'my lie'?

2029
02:15:08,938 --> 02:15:09,962
l don't want to talk about it.

2030
02:15:10,039 --> 02:15:12,166
lf you don't save him,
l will never see your face again.

2031
02:15:12,542 --> 02:15:13,440
- Abbas!
- Yes?

2032
02:15:13,509 --> 02:15:15,033
l'm Prithviraj
Raghuvanshi's sister.

2033
02:15:15,111 --> 02:15:15,736
So?

2034
02:15:15,812 --> 02:15:18,076
lf you don't save him,
l will never see your face again.

2035
02:15:18,381 --> 02:15:19,439
- Abbas!
- Yes?

2036
02:15:19,615 --> 02:15:21,981
And l will support my elders,
my elder sisters.

2037
02:15:22,118 --> 02:15:22,914
Huh?

2038
02:15:22,985 --> 02:15:24,145
Even l will never
see your face again.

2039
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:25,778
l will never see your face again.

2040
02:15:25,855 --> 02:15:26,981
Even l will never
see your face again!

2041
02:15:32,729 --> 02:15:33,753
Great!

2042
02:15:34,997 --> 02:15:36,658
On that point all
five of you agree!

2043
02:15:36,833 --> 02:15:38,198
And l'm between the
devil and the deep blue sea!

2044
02:15:41,104 --> 02:15:42,162
What do you think?

2045
02:15:42,572 --> 02:15:43,937
That you will tell
me and l will go to help?

2046
02:15:44,006 --> 02:15:45,701
No way!
Who do you think l am?

2047
02:15:46,042 --> 02:15:47,703
You think l'm the
man who doesn't get hurt?

2048
02:15:47,777 --> 02:15:49,472
You think l'm a
superhero with a cape?

2049
02:15:50,113 --> 02:15:51,478
l'm brave-heart!

2050
02:15:51,681 --> 02:15:53,148
But with this brave-heart,
l also have a mind.

2051
02:15:54,150 --> 02:15:56,141
And my mind says that l...

2052
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:03,752
Mummy!

2053
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:08,562
Prithviji...

2054
02:16:08,631 --> 02:16:09,620
Prithviji help!

2055
02:16:09,732 --> 02:16:10,892
Pr... Pr...

2056
02:16:11,033 --> 02:16:12,557
Prithviji...

2057
02:16:15,004 --> 02:16:15,698
Prithviji!

2058
02:16:15,772 --> 02:16:16,830
What are you doing here?

2059
02:16:18,708 --> 02:16:21,199
l've risked my life to save you.

2060
02:16:21,611 --> 02:16:22,908
- l Forgive you.
- What?

2061
02:16:23,112 --> 02:16:25,080
That's what you should tell me.
'l forgive you'.

2062
02:16:25,181 --> 02:16:26,580
Let's go home,
there's lots to be done.

2063
02:16:26,649 --> 02:16:29,049
Prithviraj Raghuvanshi
worships the truth.

2064
02:16:29,185 --> 02:16:31,949
- And buries...
- Shut up!

2065
02:16:36,025 --> 02:16:37,014
Ravi Shastri!

2066
02:16:37,126 --> 02:16:38,957
You're an insult
to a great cricketer.

2067
02:16:39,028 --> 02:16:40,928
Sania, you are my sister.

2068
02:16:40,997 --> 02:16:42,521
Radhika, you are my love.

2069
02:16:43,633 --> 02:16:45,294
Yet both of you are supporting him?

2070
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:46,466
Shut up!

2071
02:16:46,536 --> 02:16:47,525
You too!

2072
02:16:49,605 --> 02:16:51,163
lf Aurangzeb's grandmother
were alive today...

2073
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:52,229
even she would call
you 'elder sister'!

2074
02:16:52,308 --> 02:16:52,899
Shut up!

2075
02:16:52,975 --> 02:16:53,805
Listen...

2076
02:16:53,910 --> 02:16:55,275
No, Prithviji!

2077
02:16:55,912 --> 02:16:57,846
Today you will listen to me.

2078
02:16:58,648 --> 02:17:01,845
lf you had broken the
lock of a mosque...

2079
02:17:02,251 --> 02:17:04,219
would you say you are Prithviraj?

2080
02:17:04,287 --> 02:17:05,151
No!

2081
02:17:05,721 --> 02:17:07,018
You know what you'd say?

2082
02:17:07,256 --> 02:17:10,623
My name is Parvez Musharraf!
That's what you would say.

2083
02:17:10,827 --> 02:17:14,263
lf in a ring filled with wrestlers,
you ask questions like...

2084
02:17:14,597 --> 02:17:16,064
'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'...

2085
02:17:16,232 --> 02:17:18,291
anybody would be
scared for their life!

2086
02:17:18,901 --> 02:17:20,835
This is not fair, Prithviji!

2087
02:17:21,604 --> 02:17:23,697
You want to observe
a fast for mother, do it!

2088
02:17:23,973 --> 02:17:25,838
But why did you have to come home?

2089
02:17:25,942 --> 02:17:28,843
A child takes nine months to
come into this world.

2090
02:17:29,245 --> 02:17:30,872
But l was so afraid of you that...

2091
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:34,243
l came up with three
mothers in one day!

2092
02:17:34,684 --> 02:17:36,777
This is not fair, Prithviji!

2093
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:39,285
You not only gave me ajob...

2094
02:17:39,622 --> 02:17:42,591
you also gave my brother ajob!

2095
02:17:42,859 --> 02:17:45,225
This is not fair, Prithviji!

2096
02:17:46,395 --> 02:17:48,727
l fell in love with your sister.

2097
02:17:49,165 --> 02:17:49,859
l did!

2098
02:17:49,932 --> 02:17:51,832
But you also fell
in love with my sister.

2099
02:17:52,268 --> 02:17:53,929
But l will die Tommy's death?

2100
02:17:54,237 --> 02:17:56,364
This is not fair, Prithviji!

2101
02:17:56,606 --> 02:17:57,368
Brother!

2102
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:02,705
Can l bare my heart out to you?

2103
02:18:03,679 --> 02:18:06,239
At work, l didn't cheat
you, not even for a rupee!

2104
02:18:07,016 --> 02:18:09,007
l thought... if l continue
working honestly...

2105
02:18:10,019 --> 02:18:12,852
neither will Allah take
offence, nor will Lord Ram.

2106
02:18:16,425 --> 02:18:21,021
But if you still
think l am wrong...

2107
02:18:21,197 --> 02:18:21,959
l...

2108
02:18:23,032 --> 02:18:25,023
l will jump from here.

2109
02:18:27,203 --> 02:18:28,966
lt is better to die than to lie,
Prithviji!

2110
02:18:31,073 --> 02:18:32,097
l am going, okay!

2111
02:18:32,241 --> 02:18:34,106
Don't try to stop me, please!
Don't stop me!

2112
02:18:34,377 --> 02:18:35,969
Don't hold my hand, okay?

2113
02:18:36,045 --> 02:18:37,376
Don't hold my hand!

2114
02:18:37,947 --> 02:18:39,141
Prithviji!

2115
02:18:43,085 --> 02:18:44,382
Prithviji, don't let go of me!

2116
02:18:44,453 --> 02:18:46,250
Don't let go of
my hand! l will fall!

2117
02:18:47,757 --> 02:18:49,884
Prithviji! Prithviji!

2118
02:18:50,126 --> 02:18:52,026
Don't let go of
my hand or l'll die!

2119
02:18:52,161 --> 02:18:53,219
Now do you see...

2120
02:18:53,429 --> 02:18:56,296
where a bundle of
lies leads a person to?

2121
02:18:56,666 --> 02:18:58,998
You believe in the Almighty and
now you would've been with Him!

2122
02:19:00,236 --> 02:19:02,033
Moreover, you called me black?

2123
02:19:02,471 --> 02:19:03,301
Black?

2124
02:19:03,706 --> 02:19:04,468
You said...

2125
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:07,832
''Prithviji...

2126
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:08,874
Oh no!

2127
02:19:08,945 --> 02:19:11,140
Never mind, l forgive you.

2128
02:19:12,281 --> 02:19:15,216
Even if you bow before a
stone, that stone becomes God...

2129
02:19:15,952 --> 02:19:19,854
and if you say it from the heart,
even stone-cold Prithvi melts!

2130
02:19:20,823 --> 02:19:22,814
l'll bare my heart to you.

2131
02:19:23,459 --> 02:19:25,723
l'm actually very proud of you.

2132
02:19:27,863 --> 02:19:30,991
l'm really very proud to have you.

2133
02:19:32,201 --> 02:19:34,931
My chest has become Blouse.

2134
02:19:35,037 --> 02:19:36,299
Prithviji!

2135
02:19:37,206 --> 02:19:39,037
l will never ever lie again,
Prithviji!

2136
02:19:39,108 --> 02:19:40,837
But l want you to
promise me something...

2137
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:42,771
that you will never
talk in English again!

2138
02:19:42,845 --> 02:19:44,369
- Please!
- What?

2139
02:19:44,447 --> 02:19:46,779
Now pull me up, please!
l'm really scared.

2140
02:19:46,949 --> 02:19:48,211
Pull!
