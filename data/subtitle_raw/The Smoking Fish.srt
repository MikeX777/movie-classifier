00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:55,379
El Pez Que Fuma

2
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,126
I'm in prison, serving my sentence

3
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,097
Sentence imposed by society

4
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,102
I'm afflicted and ashamed

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,106
But I'm to serve it all alone

6
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,110
My guitar, that little orphan, plays no more

7
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,146
And though late, I now know it is real

8
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,150
That the one who plays so close to fire

9
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,110
If does not live cautiously, he will burn

10
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,126
I only ask my friends in the outside

11
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,163
To guard against liquor and its evil

12
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,167
That the only one, last and foremost

13
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,127
Is for ever the word Freedom

14
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,191
I'm in prison, serving my sentence

15
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,151
Sentence imposed by society

16
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,199
I'm afflicted and ashamed

17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,159
But I'm to serve it all alone

18
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,207
My guitar, that little orphan, plays no more

19
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,167
And though late, I now know it is real

20
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,216
That the one who plays so close to fire

21
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,176
If does not live cautiously, he will burn

22
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,224
I only ask my friends in the outside

23
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,184
To guard against liquor and its evil

24
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,232
That the only one, last and foremost

25
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,192
Is for ever the word Freedom

26
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,241
Freedom

27
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:07,203
Freedom

28
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,863
There they are! They arrived!

29
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,898
The mattresses arrived!

30
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,360
Come this way.

31
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,362
Watch out. Come.

32
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,330
Come.

33
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,335
A little down. You too.

34
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,371
Take that one to the 14th.
This one here in the 35th.

35
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,340
Check first whether it fits.

36
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,344
It fits well.

37
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,381
All right.

38
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,385
Let's change this one for the new one at once.

39
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,356
That's great. But, be careful!

40
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,391
It's all wholesale!

41
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,360
We be got new mattresses!

42
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,396
The mattresses!

43
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,365
My love!

44
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,418
Couldn't you bring those mattresses some
later?

45
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,387
I stayed awake till dawn.

46
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,394
I'm talking to you, Dumas.

47
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,403
Heron!

48
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,439
She's washing it, Heron!

49
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,441
Get that dog out of here!

50
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,443
Baby, that dog again!

51
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,445
Get it out of here!

52
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,447
Then the bedroom stinks!

53
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,449
Bring that dog here!

54
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,452
Shit, that dog is mine! Mine!

55
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,454
I'm gonna kill it!

56
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,456
I told you, I'm gonna kill it!

57
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,425
Heron! Heron!

58
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,479
She thinks she's too brave.

59
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,448
You, come this way.

60
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,484
You have a new mattress.

61
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,486
Take this.

62
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,488
Heron! Heron!

63
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,457
You have a new mattress, Heron.

64
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,460
A new mattress!

65
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,466
Watch out, watch out!

66
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,504
Look at this, Heron. Look at this. Look.

67
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,475
See how it swings. It matches your
movements.

68
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,476
Don't!

69
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,535
Don't take it away.

70
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,514
Leave that one.

71
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,485
Leave it somewhere around. Ill find a place
for it.

72
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,488
Do as she says.

73
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,495
Goodbye, Heron. I hope you enjoy it.

74
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,116
What are you thinking?

75
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,252
You know... life.

76
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,156
Well, my baby, come!

77
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,192
Let's start using the anatomical!

78
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,569
No, not in this room.

79
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,571
I think we'll have some spare ones.

80
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,542
Well, we can use those as replacement.

81
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,597
Let's move it around!

82
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,297
Nineteen and thirty-five cents.

83
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,633
Nineteen and thirty-five cents.

84
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,671
Fifty-six and fifty cents.

85
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,208
Fifty-six and fifty cents.

86
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,680
One hundred and twenty-five.

87
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,683
One hundred and twenty-five.

88
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,720
Jesus's age and seventy-five cents.

89
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,689
33 and seventy-five cents.

90
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,727
- 1,548.
- From whom?

91
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,729
The stockbreeder and Dr. Brice.

92
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,731
They were really plastered, Heron!

93
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,735
One thousand five hundred forty-eight and
zero cents.

94
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,737
The two ducklings.

95
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,705
22.

96
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,334
Add it all up.

97
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,716
Tell me, what did it come to?

98
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,719
11,518.

99
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,314
Pay the eleven cases of whisk and with the
rest,

100
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,317
buy mortgage debentures. At 8.5 percent.

101
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,081
Don't you want any deposit?

102
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,322
No. Better buy the debentures.

103
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,393
You're so gorgeous, baby.

104
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,396
Do you want something?

105
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,365
You know what I want.

106
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,802
I'll take with me what you want.

107
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,504
But I'll bring it back to you.

108
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,474
Watch out. Don't you lose it somewhere.

109
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,278
Dimas, who is the macho here?

110
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,814
You are the boss, Heron.

111
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,816
You are a little less, aren't you?

112
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,819
- Almost, almost.
- No, just a little.

113
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,821
Almost, almost.

114
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,823
Tell me, Dumas.

115
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,826
You're just a little less boss. Tell me, baby.

116
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,795
Common, tell it to me.

117
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,804
Ole, toro!

118
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,843
Goodbye, my pretty little girl!

119
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,845
You're a hot delicious thing!

120
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,848
Don't you lose it! Take care of my ding-a-ling!

121
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,819
Don't you wear it out, my little girl!

122
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,831
- Who is it?
- Peace loving people.

123
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,877
Are you the Heron?

124
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,846
It depends.

125
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,849
Tobias sent me.

126
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,896
And what's the matter with Tobias?

127
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,898
He's fine. He sends his greetings.

128
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,900
When did you see him?

129
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,903
I was in jail. I spent three days there.

130
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,905
I was released last night.

131
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,238
Then Mr. Tobias told me to talk to you.

132
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,879
Look.

133
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,516
It's a photo of him stoned the day before
yesterday,

134
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,519
because he made a bet that his aura would be
seen.

135
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,488
He explained that you have an aura,

136
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,523
that can be yellow or blue,

137
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,116
and can be seen with Lobsang Rampa's third
eye.

138
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,563
Go, bathe yourself, pig!

139
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,932
Fuck, stop beating him!

140
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,934
It's enough!

141
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,936
What the fuck did he do to you?

142
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,406
Don't you meddle! Mind your own shit!

143
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,544
I'm gonna call the police!

144
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,580
Keep on beating him and you'll see!

145
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,649
They fuck and bring children like the rabbits!

146
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,619
And then they almost devour their own breed.

147
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,922
Fucking misery.

148
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,959
What does that jerk want? Money I have not!

149
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,961
- No, he doesn't. Me.
- What?

150
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,964
- I want to be in your business.
- As a whore?

151
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,932
Anything.

152
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,968
What do you mean by anything?

153
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,970
Anything you tell me to do.

154
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,973
And then I get into trouble for hiring a minor?

155
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,942
Don't you be stupid!

156
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,079
Do you want to see my documents?

157
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,959
Quintero Garcia, Jairo Javier.

158
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,995
Born on the 10th of the 10th, 1958.

159
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,964
Single and fag.

160
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,001
The tenth of the tenth, 1958.

161
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,003
Which month is the tenth?

162
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,972
It's October.

163
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,975
Dictatorship was already over.

164
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,113
There are many who are the same age as
democracy.

165
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,985
Right now there's no job for you, Jairo.

166
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,155
I was left a wreck.

167
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,220
Mr. Dumas. Mr. Dumas, spare me a second.

168
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,222
I would like to talk to you.

169
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,224
I was talking to Ms. Heron and...

170
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,193
Mr. Dumas! Please, Mr. Dumas!

171
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,196
Go away, please.

172
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,264
Who the hell told you to go to the racetrack?

173
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,267
It was Batman Sosa It was Batman Sosa

174
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,269
How the hell can I explain?

175
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,272
He gave me the money to bet and told me I
would win!

176
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,274
That fucking Batman Sosa

177
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,944
I told you to buy the mortgage debentures and
pay the whisk!

178
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,914
I didn't mention Batman Sosa!

179
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,550
But I also have my life, don't I? Am I your dog or something?

180
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:28,553
And if he puts me on a business, what Am I to
say?:

181
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,524
No, no way. My girl will lose her rag. Fuck you!

182
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,559
I'm not your girl!

183
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,594
Me your girl?

184
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,662
Because you lay with me?

185
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,664
Am I your girl for that shit?

186
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,666
Oh, baby, you don't know me.

187
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,637
This way you came in, this way you went out.

188
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,306
You can stay with your Batman Sosa

189
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,308
I reckon he's even a fag!

190
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,310
Don't talk to me so. Respect me

191
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,312
or I'll beat the shit out of you!

192
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,281
Will you?

193
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,952
What is it for? To pay for the car?

194
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,954
Very impressive.

195
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:06,057
I had the car insured last month.

196
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,959
In a week it'll be all brand new.

197
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,961
That's yet to be seen.

198
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,932
What do you know about insurance, dickhead?

199
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,958
You are always that way. Everything is easy to
you.

200
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,303
They could have killed me!

201
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,438
It was Tobias! I'm sure it was him!

202
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,998
What Tobias? Tobias is in jail.

203
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,044
After all, they should kill you for being an
asshole!

204
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,079
You shut up!

205
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,114
I'm more worth than a car, aren't I?

206
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,183
More than a Caprice? Let me tell you, you
aren't.

207
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,552
Right, then. Keep your money and your shit
and fuck off!

208
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,331
Get out of my way, fucking useless lame!

209
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,333
Coward!

210
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:49,935
Coward!

211
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,905
Why don't you pick on a man?

212
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,907
If oil hadn't damaged my legs,

213
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,377
you would have been in serious trouble,
Dumas!

214
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,059
THE FISH THAT SMOKES

215
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,450
- What is it, jerk?
- Nothing.

216
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,486
What are you looking at?

217
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,489
- Is it your car? Your motorcycle?
- They aren't.

218
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,492
- So What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

219
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,494
I don't like people looking at.

220
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,463
Never mind. I saw nothing.

221
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,513
I can see in your face you're a rat.

222
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,515
Who are you informing?

223
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,486
I won't tell, buddy. Forget it. Stay cool.

224
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,503
Are we even, buddy?

225
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,529
Good evening.

226
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,536
Oh, Lord.

227
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,539
It seems you recognize me.

228
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,546
Why is it so you recognize me?

229
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,584
Darling, you seem to have lost something

230
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,553
the moment you saw me.

231
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,558
Could it be that we play in the same band?

232
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,561
All right. Silent, please.

233
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,564
And now, tonight's guessing game:

234
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,600
It begins with P

235
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,602
and ends in,

236
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,604
and we all like it.

237
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,606
Pussy! Pussy!

238
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,608
Pussy! Pussy!

239
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,610
Pussy! Pussy!

240
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,612
Pussy! Pussy!

241
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,581
Wrong. It's pastry.

242
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,621
Ladies and truckers.

243
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,624
From Hamburg, big city of science,

244
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,626
we have tonight a Venezuelan lady

245
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,629
who has proudly represented our coat of arms:

246
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,598
The Satanic!

247
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,649
One more?

248
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,652
Two more.

249
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,697
Hey.

250
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,736
Who's that sitting with Maria?

251
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,705
They've been already an hour there.

252
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,704
Is he ordering gin or what?

253
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,742
No. Just mineral water and ice.

254
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,711
Is he? Tell her to come here.

255
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,759
Would you do me a big favor?

256
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,762
It's such a favor that in forty years from now

257
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,722
I will still be thankful from the bottom of my
heart.

258
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,770
Please, baby, don't you piss me off.

259
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,774
How come are you wasting the night drinking
cold water

260
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,743
with that good-for-nothing?

261
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,747
What do you have him there for?

262
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,361
It can't be so, Bunny.

263
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,396
Listen. I mean.

264
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,300
I don't want to get pissed, you see.

265
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,336
You know how I am when I get pissed.

266
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,440
What are you laughing at, jerk?

267
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,442
You can go laugh at your mother!

268
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,411
Me? How come?

269
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,447
Common, I'm laughing at nothing.

270
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,481
Try to get yourself something worthwhile,
something better.

271
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,983
Look. Maybe even my friend here wants.

272
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,793
I have no dough.

273
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,902
Want some?

274
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,403
What's the day today?

275
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,350
I said what's the day today.

276
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,925
Thursday.

277
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,331
Where is the Heron?

278
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,371
In the house.

279
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,984
I have a bruise here, you see?

280
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,986
It was Dumas who did it.

281
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,955
And your dog he also maltreated.

282
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,013
Listen, Daniel: What became of Linda?

283
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:36,981
Linda?

284
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:38,549
Linda?

285
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,019
But I have no news of fer.

286
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,021
She's gone.

287
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,023
She hasn't written.

288
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,025
And God only knows...

289
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,994
And God only knows...

290
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,160
I came for my severance.

291
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,005
He crashed my car.

292
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,041
He smashed it to bits.

293
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,010
Sheer shreds.

294
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,013
And then he comes and tells me:

295
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,019
No problem. We've got insurance.

296
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,057
Always the insurance.

297
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:20,923
I'm leaving, Heron.

298
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,030
There's a solution for everything, my daughter.

299
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,066
You get your car crashed,

300
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,069
the insurance pays for it.

301
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,071
You die,

302
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,042
then comes the insurance and pays for it.

303
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,045
Don't you go, Bunny.

304
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,048
Take a bath.

305
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,084
Go and take a bath.

306
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,086
Water it.

307
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,057
Watch as your shrubs get watered.

308
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,060
I met Pedro Vargas...

309
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,066
in Acapulco in 1953,

310
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,071
He was there, taking a bath in a pool.

311
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,107
That is, Daniel Santos

312
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,076
and the Sonora Macerate.

313
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,114
All of them.

314
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,117
All of them taking a bath at the pool.

315
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,088
In 1953, in Acapulco.

316
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,123
And all of them...

317
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,125
had their insurance.

318
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,127
Fire insurance.

319
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,129
Comprehensive insurance.

320
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,098
Accident insurance.

321
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,119
Don't you go away from me, Bunny.

322
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,124
You're leaving, aren't you?

323
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,138
Look! A pig!

324
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,142
Catch it! Catch it!

325
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,152
Catch it!

326
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,156
He caught it!

327
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,159
Now we re gonna kill it!

328
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,178
I'd better get off! Stop!

329
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,256
I'm going to buy me a horse.

330
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,224
Yes.

331
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm going to buy me a thoroughbred.

332
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,229
A thoroughbred.

333
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,265
Why can't I have a horse

334
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,268
if I want to have a horse?

335
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,239
Listen, blond guy! Blond guy!

336
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,241
Fuck.

337
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,678
You destroyed my car, Tobias.

338
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,714
You destroyed my car.

339
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,817
But I have a horse.

340
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,286
Long live the Mariachi!

341
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,828
Heron!

342
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,897
Stone-made has to be the bed

343
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,900
Stone-made its headboard too

344
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:01,862
The woman who loves me

345
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,810
She's got to love me true

346
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,354
My sweet heart, why do you love him?

347
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,323
Heron!

348
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,328
Heron!

349
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,365
Blond guy.

350
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,367
Watch out.

351
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,336
Give way, Blond guy.

352
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,343
No, wait a second.

353
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,346
Heron!

354
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,362
Dumas, I want my severance pay.

355
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,402
No way. You're not leaving this place, Bunny.

356
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,373
No, you lady, you stay here.

357
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,377
You, Ms. Bunny, you don't leave this place.

358
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,039
You can't stand me, can you?

359
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,104
Until today.

360
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,074
At noon, I'm taking a bus.

361
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,078
I will get a job.

362
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,048
No way. Staying up all night.

363
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,051
I can't even watch the soap opera.

364
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,020
I used to watch it before.

365
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,123
What's the use, after all?

366
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,191
They're the ones who get the profit.

367
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,160
And it's big money.

368
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,855
And we always screwed up.

369
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,068
And Dumas telling me off.

370
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,043
Again?

371
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,075
You'll have to pay double, you know?

372
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,558
Here. Here.

373
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,602
Here, tiny one. Come here, baby.

374
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,368
Take this, baby. Come, my tiny little one.

375
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,343
Black, come here! Here, my son!

376
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,085
Tell them to bring an orange juice.

377
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,156
But not sour.

378
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:47,191
I want some little sweet oranges

379
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,226
with little ice cubes.

380
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,231
Who did you leave with last night?

381
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,200
With the Monkey.

382
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,172
You're cheating on me.

383
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,208
I know you're cheating on me.

384
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,243
I know you are into something.

385
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:12,416
You always find the way to make me forgive
you.

386
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,420
But stupid I am not.

387
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,456
Did you hear, my baby girl?

388
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,104
Keep your hands off that dough!

389
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,587
What's up, buddy?

390
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:57,954
So what about last night?

391
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,703
Man, I'm broke. I'm really broke.

392
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,705
I saw when you arrived last night.

393
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,707
All angry and stuff.

394
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,676
I know it was not the right moment.

395
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,612
But I came to see whether you could get me a
job.

396
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,208
Doing what?

397
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,255
Anything, man. Whatever you tell me.

398
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:26,290
The thing is to earn something.

399
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,361
Listen, brother. I'll be frank.

400
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,363
I was released from jail yesterday.

401
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:37,323
I spent 3 days there for some investigation.

402
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,337
I mean...

403
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,373
A Portuguese's fish shop was robbed.

404
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,408
A friend of mine was arrested

405
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,443
and then they wanted to involve me.

406
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,346
Then I went to talk to the lawyer

407
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,315
and it was settled. I was released.

408
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,285
So while in jail, I met a man

409
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:58,255
who had a grudge against you. This man here.

410
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,434
What do you know about Tobias?

411
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,870
Why did he send you? Who the fuck crashed
my car?

412
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,906
- You know it!
- What car?

413
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,476
It was you! He sent you! What does he want?

414
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:22,479
What did he say? You're gonna tell me right
away!

415
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,448
But, my man. Brother...

416
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,786
You'll see, shit!

417
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,788
What does Tobias want?

418
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,790
Man, let me explain! I came here

419
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,793
because Tobias told me the Heron would get
me a job.

420
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,796
But you know, he's always stoned and angry
at you,

421
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,800
saying that you told on him and that he'll fuck
you up.

422
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,503
But I have nothing to do with it! I thought, since
I know you now

423
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:49,473
and we went on a binge last night, I could
explain.

424
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,609
I'm not scheming anything. If I were,

425
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:54,678
I wouldn't have told you. Actually, I wasn't
going to.

426
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:57,681
And I'm sure I would've got the job, anyway.

427
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:59,683
All right. Al right.

428
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:01,685
I'll be a jerk and will believe you.

429
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:04,382
Go away! Go away!

430
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,806
So, man, are you gonna let me go?

431
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,401
Then it is not worth being decent in this world.

432
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,829
In Japan, there's no official policy concerning
UFOs.

433
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,768
And they take this opportunity to invite you in
October

434
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:57,367
to the 4th Convention... of Astronomical
Sciences.

435
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,244
Do they pay for the expenses?

436
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:05,382
They don't mention anything here about
expenses.

437
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,053
Do keep on writing and thanks again.

438
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,389
I knew it.

439
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,391
Japanese are very serious people.

440
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:18,692
Don't they mention anything about the
Bermuda triangle?

441
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,398
Not a word.

442
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,468
We are in the tragic quarter.

443
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,469
October...

444
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,437
November...

445
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:29,406
December.

446
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,412
Why have so many ships vanished in the
Bermuda triangle?

447
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,480
For there is the headquarters of the flying
saucers.

448
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,352
I once saw a flying saucer.

449
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:48,158
I was driving down the highway with an aunt of
mine

450
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,128
and we saw one and it was very clear.

451
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,230
Was the radiation violet or orange?

452
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,266
I reckon... orange.

453
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,435
It's the classic Venusian saucer.

454
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,505
Violet: Mars.

455
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,301
Orange: Venus.

456
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:07,511
And when it is white...

457
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,414
The big mystery.

458
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,585
Then suddenly,

459
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:17,587
some sort of a hole opened

460
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,556
and the saucer sat on a small hill,

461
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,593
and two tiny men, this size, came out, and
greeted us.

462
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,465
You may laugh.

463
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:31,502
They are contacting us and you just laugh.

464
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,537
Aliens do exist

465
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:36,301
and they will be masters of the whole world.

466
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:38,568
Give me.

467
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:41,571
And also of the whores!

468
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,960
Hello, Jacinto..

469
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,966
Here.

470
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,002
I believe they suit you well.

471
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,670
If anything, we fix it.

472
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,638
Cool.

473
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:11,675
- Don't you have shampoo?
- I bring it right away.

474
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,016
Hey, Jacobin.

475
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,987
You don't waste time, do you, baby?

476
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:28,992
Wait!

477
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,037
Sorry. I was in the shower.

478
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:45,041
Never mind. There's nothing in there I haven't
seen before.

479
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,012
Go back in the shower or you'll catch a cold.

480
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,059
- What is it Tobias wants?
- Well... he...

481
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,030
You re wasting water and you don't pay for it.

482
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,065
What did Tobias tell you?

483
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,067
- How's he doing?
- Well, you know...

484
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,069
We didn't talk much.

485
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,071
But he always remembers you.

486
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,073
And what does he remember?

487
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,075
Well, he always goes:

488
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,046
And the Heron this, and the Heron that...

489
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,081
What did he send you here for?

490
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,084
Because I'm not buying that story you told
Dumas.

491
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,087
Well, I told you already: I'm looking for a job.

492
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,056
In this business?

493
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,058
Well.

494
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,061
I just need to begin.

495
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,099
Why, Jairo.

496
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,068
What a big thing...

497
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,071
What a big thing life is.

498
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,077
Here is the shampoo.

499
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,131
Well, baby, that way is impossible.

500
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,133
Look.

501
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:53,770
One searches, full of hope

502
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,740
The road that his dreams

503
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:59,777
Promised to his longings

504
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,845
In other words, they promised that to us.

505
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,848
That's life. Which is the road to your longings?

506
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,818
That's life.

507
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:10,887
But from the guts, baby. From the vaginal

508
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:12,856
Shit! Go on!

509
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,192
So you want me to give it tutti?

510
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,160
Start!

511
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,197
One searches, full of hope

512
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,200
The road that his dreams

513
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,204
Promised to his longings

514
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,207
One knows that the struggle is cruel and long

515
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,209
But one fights and bleeds

516
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,212
For the faith that makes him stumble

517
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,215
That makes him stubborn! That makes him
stubborn!

518
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,218
How come is it going to make him stumble?

519
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,220
See, one fights and bleeds.

520
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,223
But one insists and insists, so then one is
stubborn!

521
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,224
Come on!

522
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,193
That makes him stubborn

523
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,230
One goes crawling on the thorns

524
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:58,234
And in his urge to give his passion

525
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,205
Oh, Lord! It's not passion, it's love, love!

526
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,241
One goes crawling on the thorns

527
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,201
And in his urge to give his love

528
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,249
one suffers and self-destroys understanding

529
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,254
that one was left without a heart

530
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,257
Price for punishment that one pays

531
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,260
For a kiss that never comes

532
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:28,264
Or for a love that was unfaithful

533
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,267
Already empty from loving

534
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,269
And crying

535
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:40,233
So much betrayal

536
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:52,245
If I had the heart

537
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,293
The heart I gave away

538
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,297
If I could, like yesterday

539
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:05,257
To love without a premonition

540
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,304
It's possible that your eyes

541
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,306
That cried out to me their love

542
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:14,310
I'd close them with my kisses

543
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,312
Without thinking that like these

544
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,315
They were other wicked eyes

545
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,318
That ruined my existence

546
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,322
If I had the heart

547
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:30,282
The same one I lost

548
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,330
If I'd forget the one that yesterday

549
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,332
Tore it apart,

550
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,336
And I could love you

551
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:44,340
I would embrace in your illusion

552
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:49,302
To cry out your love

553
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,349
But God brought you in my destiny

554
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,351
Without thinking that it's too late

555
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,354
And I won't know how to love you

556
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,356
Let me cry like one

557
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,359
Who suffers in life the torture

558
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,363
Of mourning his own death

559
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,366
Pure as you are, you could've saved

560
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,337
My hope with your love

561
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,341
One is so lonely in his pain

562
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:22,378
One is so blind in his grieve

563
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,380
But a cruel cold

564
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,382
Crueler than hate

565
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,384
Dead spot of the souls

566
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:32,388
Horrendous tomb of my love

567
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:37,393
Cursed forever and stole

568
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:42,355
All hope

569
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:50,406
If I had the heart

570
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:55,411
The same one I lost

571
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,414
If I'd forget the one that yesterday

572
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,416
Tore it apart

573
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:05,378
And I could love you

574
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:10,382
I would embrace in your illusion

575
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,396
To cry out

576
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:19,392
Your love

577
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,419
Garden will live forever!

578
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,497
Give a tip to the guy.

579
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,034
It was Tobias, man.

580
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,527
It was him. No doubt about it.

581
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:40,076
But he's in jail. How come it's him?

582
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,045
Say it, Batman.

583
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,149
Last Sunday he got a visit in jail.

584
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,087
Tell him who, Batman.

585
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,124
The Camacho with two kids, just to make
believe.

586
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,027
It was Lead Hand who told me.

587
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,097
He told me to tell it to you and Dumas.

588
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,100
And then? Keep on telling me he's not.

589
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,103
That shit is very clear. Crystal clear.

590
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,105
They crashed me. Who?

591
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:12,108
Rivera, the Black. Who is he going out with?

592
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:16,341
The Camacho. It is very clear to me.

593
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,594
But I have an idea.

594
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,368
My name is Deborah.

595
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,338
They call me the Calcutta girl.

596
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:46,409
But I don't come from there.

597
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,246
I'm from San Cristobal.

598
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:55,218
But I like being called so. That I'm from
Calcutta.

599
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,221
Because it sounds like...

600
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:00,256
from a far away place.

601
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,196
Look.

602
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,633
Get up.

603
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,279
You may look like a fool, but have already
fucked two,

604
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,315
and they re two good mares.

605
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:29,252
Where are we heading?

606
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:52,275
All right? Take it to him.

607
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:55,278
Tobias.

608
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,314
Tell him I send it.

609
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,351
- And if they...
- There'll be No problem.

610
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:04,420
They'll allow you to pass it. Go. Go.

611
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:05,388
Go.

612
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:37,776
How's everything, Mr. Tobias?

613
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:47,530
You're all blue, blond guy.

614
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:51,367
I see you all blue.

615
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,372
Your karma is very intense.

616
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,410
Blond guy, that's right.

617
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,758
Now I remember.

618
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,762
I sent you to the Heron's.

619
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,799
You saw her. Did she give you some job?

620
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,497
Yes, thank you. Everything's fine.

621
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,407
What's that?

622
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,409
You brought it for me?

623
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,378
Thank you, blond guy.

624
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,806
This is the Heron!

625
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,313
Was she the one who sent it?

626
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,284
No. It was Dumas who sent it.

627
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:18,821
Judas!

628
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,824
Judas!

629
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,820
Judas!

630
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,394
Judas!

631
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,486
Judas!

632
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:28,864
Judas!

633
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,833
Judas!

634
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,471
What did he tell you?

635
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,507
Nothing. He went crazy.

636
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,543
What did he say about me?

637
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,578
That you should watch your back.

638
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,613
Jerk.

639
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,350
Listen, kid.

640
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,385
You know something?

641
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,421
In life, you have something like...

642
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:53,489
like a clock, you know.

643
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,492
I mean... If it's six o'clock,

644
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:59,462
you have to be at the right spot at six.

645
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,497
Right there, at six.

646
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,534
Because if you are there a bit before, or a bit
after,

647
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,503
poor kid...

648
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,335
Poor kid!

649
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,934
Look.

650
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,936
Bet it on the Reliance.

651
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,905
Keep your eyes open.

652
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,971
Make your bets!

653
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,339
I bet 100 on Reliance!

654
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,308
One hundred more! Paid.

655
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,946
I bet on it too! One hundred more!

656
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,018
Police. Your identification.

657
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,029
He's armed.

658
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,066
These ain't... these ain't policemen!

659
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,035
They ain't real policemen!

660
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,058
Well, Black man.

661
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,062
Black man, you're fucked up.

662
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,065
Who sent you? Was it Tobias?

663
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,694
Tobias sent you and you, jerk, went and obey
him.

664
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,104
Oh, dear.

665
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,072
Listen.

666
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:33,203
How much did he give you?

667
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,146
I'm gonna give you more.

668
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,187
In the name of God almighty!

669
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,190
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost!

670
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,759
In the Name of Saint Peter, Saint Paul,

671
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,761
of all the Heavenly Court!

672
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,732
Granted permission of the saint of today,

673
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,801
I offer the smokes of this cigar

674
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,770
to the God almighty and eternal.

675
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,207
May He grant luck to the Heron.

676
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,178
May He open to you, oh, Sister, all roads
clean.

677
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:16,805
So be it.

678
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,839
You know what? We re gonna set up a
branch.

679
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,809
But that's gonna be a five stars branch.

680
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:30,879
Oh, yeah. We're even gonna have computers.

681
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,882
Goddammit! Whores and computers.

682
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,885
Oh, yeah, with devices like the ones in the
track.

683
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:39,855
Everything's gonna be timed.

684
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:44,960
Listen, Heron. Heron.

685
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,364
Stick on me, stick on me like glue,

686
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,367
so that everything keeps on being fine with
you.

687
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,369
You know what, Heron?

688
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,371
I'm a man who knows how to thank.

689
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,373
As you hear. Who was I

690
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,376
when you put me in front of the business?

691
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,379
When you got involved with me, who was I?

692
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,348
Heron, I was nothing.

693
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,351
Nothing. I was nothing.

694
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,353
Nothing.

695
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,394
You with that shit...

696
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,411
Look at this!

697
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,447
What a big surprise!

698
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,416
You look like a kitten.

699
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,423
He did have fun.

700
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,468
I knew it, my little kid.

701
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,470
I knew it.

702
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,439
I knew it.

703
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,477
Today you became a grown up! The hell you
did!

704
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,479
No, I'm never wrong. I see some face

705
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,482
and say: There you go, that's it. That I know.

706
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,485
I always hit the bull's eye. I'm never misled.

707
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,488
And that's it. From tomorrow on, you with me.

708
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,491
Not anymore that shit of delivering toilet paper

709
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,493
and cleaning the toilets. No, no, no.

710
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,495
From tomorrow on, you are on my side,

711
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,497
- you go with me. Dammit.
- Count it.

712
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,466
- What?
- Count the money.

713
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,503
You re wrong.

714
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,472
I don't count money from a real man.

715
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,552
I don't get tips from anybody.

716
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,590
What's that beauty?

717
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,626
Is it new? Or is it the same

718
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,628
and you had it fixed?

719
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,063
There was no problem with the insurance.

720
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,655
Listen.

721
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,657
Knock on room 15.

722
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,660
A man who doesn't speak Spanish will
answer.

723
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,663
You'll tell him: Janis Joplin is dead

724
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,631
Repeat.

725
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,402
- That's right.
- What does it mean?

726
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,371
It doesn't matter what it means.

727
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,407
You tell him that. All right?

728
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,662
Janis Joplin is dead.

729
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:11,879
We sell this thing in three days.

730
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,049
In two.

731
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,485
Shall we try the product?

732
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:29,731
Jairo.

733
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,734
Do you like?

734
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,761
Monkey!

735
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,764
Let's go!

736
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,767
Give the car keys to the blond guy.

737
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:09,771
Blond guy.

738
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,775
Take the Heron to the business.

739
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:20,782
Heron!

740
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,791
A... as in America...

741
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,794
B, as in Beatrice.

742
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,798
C, as in Carmen.

743
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,804
D... as in Dalia.

744
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,810
Dima's women.

745
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,848
I don't understand why

746
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,817
a man has to have so many women.

747
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,853
As for me...

748
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,822
The only woman that...

749
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,858
that I've really had...

750
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,860
I mean, the only one,

751
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,863
it has been my mother, God rest her soul.

752
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,832
She used to prepare...

753
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,868
a delicious roast beef.

754
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,870
Well, of course...

755
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,872
that isn't the only reason.

756
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,875
I get sad when I remember the roast beef.

757
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:21,843
But...

758
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,879
She was so... so soft...

759
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,848
and all so white.

760
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,853
And those teeth of hers, those teeth of hers.

761
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,355
I think that...

762
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:37,326
when you lose your mom, you lose all.

763
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,961
Oh, my darling!

764
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:41,963
A mother's love

765
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:43,932
is the greatest thing of all!

766
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,036
Remember mom

767
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,072
when I was a little girl,

768
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:52,140
on Basalt Street, in Maracaibo.

769
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:54,142
She used to take me to the market

770
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:57,112
and she would go and buy me candies.

771
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:00,915
Louder.

772
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:01,883
Louder.

773
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,889
I said my mom was very good.

774
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,883
With her long braids...

775
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,597
They were long...

776
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:21,402
So long they would reach the floor

777
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:24,373
and would go like sweeping it all along the
market.

778
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,342
You would be tempted...

779
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,313
You would be tempted to paint my mom.

780
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:39,554
Did she die too?

781
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,557
She was buried in Cabins.

782
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:46,561
I haven't been able to visit her.

783
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:47,595
Why?

784
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:50,895
In that area the Americans found oil.

785
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:54,569
And then one day,

786
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,605
one day that...

787
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:58,836
that I saw oil, I thought,

788
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,511
I thought that oil was her.

789
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:06,581
Shit. How sad, isn't it?

790
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,154
The money, the business.

791
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:14,589
The whores!

792
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,563
Why don't we go to Cabins

793
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,533
and take some flowers to her tomb?

794
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:28,061
After all, oil is ours.

795
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,375
She is also ours.

796
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,313
And I'm your son and I'm your mother.

797
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:44,185
Were two little orphans.

798
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,131
Do not go with that man.

799
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,548
How's everything?

800
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:05,218
Under control.

801
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,223
What do you plan to do with that money?

802
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:43,248
Nothing.

803
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:48,126
I feel like buying me a horse, Heron.

804
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:49,687
I have a chance at the track.

805
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:51,699
Three months or so...

806
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,267
Or we go away, Heron. To Disneyland,

807
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,835
or to Miami, to Europe.

808
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:56,327
So what do you think?

809
01:27:57,806 --> 01:27:58,773
It can be.

810
01:28:01,877 --> 01:28:03,845
- What happened?
- Nothing.

811
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,848
-Come, my Heron. Come.

812
01:28:06,915 --> 01:28:08,883
- Come.
- No, not now.

813
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,919
What's the matter, Heron?

814
01:28:15,157 --> 01:28:17,758
! already purchased the little house

815
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:19,727
That I for so long promised to you

816
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,763
And full of daisies... Come here, come.

817
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:22,797
Come.

818
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:25,666
What do you want me for?

819
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,501
You're always that way.

820
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:30,472
No problem. If you're cool, no problem.

821
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:33,167
What's the matter with you, Heron?

822
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,311
Nothing. I'm fine.

823
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,313
Heron, Heron, come here.

824
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:42,316
- What's going on?
- It's OK. Keep your money.

825
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,319
But, wait a second, Heron. What did they tell
you?

826
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,654
What did they tell you?

827
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:48,656
I've done nothing! What...?

828
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,626
It was the Pick lock. I'm sure it was him.

829
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:54,695
He's not collecting the tickets anymore!

830
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:57,666
Who the hell told you, you make the decisions
here?

831
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,733
You're getting too bold, baby.

832
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:01,735
You seem to forget who's the boss.

833
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:04,738
I'm the one who gives the orders here!

834
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,641
You may be temporary, but I'm not.

835
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,443
That's the difference.

836
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:11,812
Count your money and then do as you wish!

837
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:13,781
Get yourself one of your broads!

838
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,817
Or you think I don't know it?

839
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:17,852
Oh, baby. I just act dumb.

840
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:21,922
Until I fucking feel like acting dumb!

841
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:24,893
What did they tell you? Heron! Heron! Heron!

842
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,372
Fix me a drink, Catfish.

843
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,404
What's going on, Heron?

844
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,417
Come with me.

845
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:33,714
Leave this place.

846
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:35,989
I don't wanna find you here tomorrow.

847
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,593
Whatever happened, that was it.

848
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:42,097
We were raptures... and so it happened.

849
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:45,165
But don't you believe it meant something.

850
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,135
I'm not believing anything.

851
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,488
Go watch, as I ordered you! What are you
doing out here?

852
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:08,353
Take care of that shit!

853
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,027
When I was a child, you used to take me in
your arms.

854
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,540
Do you remember that mom would then yell at
you?:

855
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,542
Be careful with your little sister.

856
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,511
Do not let her fall.

857
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,218
Why are you still here?

858
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,089
Where else would I go?

859
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:45,822
What happens, Heron?

860
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:47,626
Did you argue with Dumas?

861
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:49,997
I don't know.

862
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:54,601
What happens to my man, happens to me.

863
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:58,439
What happens to Tobias, happens to me.

864
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,273
What happens to Dumas... I don't know.

865
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,909
I have been not with men,

866
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,548
but yards of men.

867
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,551
Miles of men.

868
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,587
A highway of men.

869
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,558
And it's always the same, the same, the same.

870
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,562
Who's the candidate now?

871
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:25,166
I don't know.

872
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:27,201
If you want, we can have a campaign,

873
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:29,269
like for some type of election,

874
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,239
to see who gets more votes.

875
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,077
I only know that in this chair

876
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:38,943
will always sit the same man.

877
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,588
My blessing.

878
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,595
Ain't you gonna wash me?

879
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:38,801
Go.

880
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:40,274
No.

881
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:42,335
I'm staying.

882
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,662
What's the matter with you, huh?

883
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:03,630
What's the matter with you?

884
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,701
You're not leaving me!

885
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:10,704
I don't know what you gave me, what you did
to me,

886
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,508
I don't know if you put a spell or some kind of
voodoo,

887
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:16,477
but you're not leaving me.

888
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,545
It's true that I have my mistresses.

889
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,547
But no one's like you.

890
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,549
Because I'm not temporary here.

891
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,520
I'm gonna show you I'm not temporary.

892
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:28,589
I'm gonna show you you're the queen!

893
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:31,559
I'm gonna show you you're the only one!

894
01:35:31,626 --> 01:35:33,594
I'm gonna show it to you.

895
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:42,029
What's up, man?

896
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,714
You were really boozed-up last night!

897
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,750
I saw you when you got here.

898
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,719
What's happening to you, buddy?

899
01:36:00,288 --> 01:36:01,255
Things.

900
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,759
Last night, when you left, I saw the Heron.

901
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,761
She was strange.

902
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,730
What's wrong, buddy?

903
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,772
Women, dude, women are a serious thing.

904
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,774
With them you've got to be tough.

905
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:23,777
If you get besotted, then they get on top of
you.

906
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,779
I understand they have their quirks,

907
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:28,782
and the moon affects them, but that's like
driving:

908
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,952
If you hold the wheel tightly, nobody fucking
fishtails.

909
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:34,285
Buddy, you're great.

910
01:36:34,856 --> 01:36:37,825
You're really... You're really a tough type.

911
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,596
Well, you're something like a university of life.

912
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,799
Listen, kid.

913
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,325
Are you teasing me?

914
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:50,271
No, buddy, no way. All things straight.

915
01:36:50,338 --> 01:36:53,307
I give the credits to the one who deserves
them.

916
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,799
Eleven and seventy-five.

917
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,802
Eleven and seventy-five.

918
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:26,840
Nineteen and fifty.

919
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,809
Nineteen and fifty.

920
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:35,849
What?

921
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,818
It's not readable.

922
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:41,422
It's not readable. You're blind!

923
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:43,457
A hundred and ninety-eight!

924
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,493
It looks like a six.

925
01:37:46,127 --> 01:37:49,129
How come a six? It's an 8! The 8's gonna
haunt you!

926
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:51,131
I don't know what you're doing here.

927
01:37:51,132 --> 01:37:55,091
You don't see anymore. Tonight you won't be
at the counter!

928
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,904
Last week a forged bill. Now, an 8.

929
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:00,207
I've been managing the business for 20 years.

930
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:03,243
Precisely! It's over!

931
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:05,212
Today was your last day at the counter!

932
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:07,181
Devote yourself to your saucers!

933
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:09,249
You're becoming a nuisance!

934
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,218
Who will you replace him with?

935
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,488
You know with whom.

936
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:16,556
So don't come asking baloney,

937
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:18,526
you know very well who's gonna be.

938
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:24,598
Stop that silly melody! And you go back to
your shit!

939
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:27,367
Go and wax! That's too much body hair

940
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:29,636
Do yourself up cause your value is falling!

941
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:32,607
You used to be worth 60, now you're worth 40!

942
01:38:32,874 --> 01:38:36,207
And you're already 40 and all that hair in the
legs!

943
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:38,605
Here, Heron.

944
01:38:58,466 --> 01:39:01,468
Kid, the other day when you brought the Heron

945
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:05,428
from the beach... what did she tell you?

946
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:06,940
About what?

947
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:09,911
About me. Did she tell you something about
me?

948
01:39:10,478 --> 01:39:11,445
Well...

949
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,415
You know, buddy... Nothing...

950
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,953
What did she tell you? Nothing?

951
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:21,955
Well, she told me you were cool.

952
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,958
That Dumas does this, Dumas does that...

953
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,960
She asked if you had another woman,

954
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,962
if I had seen her...

955
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:30,964
She made you look like a TV star.

956
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:33,967
That you were good and quite a hunk, so
much

957
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:37,927
I almost regretted being a man cause you
wouldn't woo me.

958
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:42,642
What a drag, isn't it, Jairo?

959
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,612
It's just you're the master, buddy.

960
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:48,638
The good Lord made you stereophonic and full
equipped.

961
01:39:58,493 --> 01:39:59,721
It is not counted.

962
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:03,531
Heron, let's go eat at the beach.

963
01:40:03,598 --> 01:40:06,600
It needs to be deposited. Banks close
tomorrow.

964
01:40:06,601 --> 01:40:09,570
Jairo, take this to the bank. You know the
procedure.

965
01:40:10,438 --> 01:40:13,407
She lends you her car. No problem. Right?

966
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:15,570
Right.

967
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,085
The day will come...

968
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:35,088
when I will give you all this.

969
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,091
And I will tell you: Silva Maria, here you are,

970
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,093
buy yourself candies.

971
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:44,097
Or cigarettes. Here you are, buy yourself
cigarettes.

972
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:47,068
You're my female. You get me going.

973
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:54,074
I'll be right back.

974
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:35,116
Let go of me! Let go of me!

975
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,153
You'd better move your contacts

976
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:43,156
cause I'll have you fired from the police!

977
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,158
I know Tobias is behind all this!

978
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:47,160
I know it is Tobias! Heron!

979
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:49,129
Wait! Heron!

980
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:22,195
Drug trafficking.

981
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:24,197
Illegal gambling.

982
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,166
Impersonation of authority.

983
01:43:27,835 --> 01:43:29,803
We finally got hold of you, Dumas.

984
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,608
All right, Kojak.

985
01:43:36,644 --> 01:43:39,646
You can put there what you like for all I care,

986
01:43:39,647 --> 01:43:41,615
but you'll have to prove that crap!

987
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,787
How is the little mother going?

988
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:30,824
My lady still doesn't know

989
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:33,794
who the father of the little son of a bitch is?

990
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:37,798
Give birth soon,

991
01:45:37,865 --> 01:45:40,867
because there's a lot of work out there

992
01:45:40,868 --> 01:45:42,836
and we re not going to support you.

993
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:56,349
Izaguirre, what is it now?

994
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:59,352
Until when am I gonna stay locked in here?

995
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:01,354
Such an easy case like mine,

996
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:04,357
that any dumb lawyer would've taken me out,

997
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:07,360
and you're all puzzled. So, what then?

998
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,329
Where are we going to celebrate?

999
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:17,938
You'll pay dearly for this, Dumas.

1000
01:47:12,693 --> 01:47:13,660
Miami?

1001
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:36,883
I'm going to Miami with my love!

1002
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:20,928
I thought you were different

1003
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:25,899
I thought you were sincere

1004
01:48:28,102 --> 01:48:31,071
And! Gave you my fife

1005
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:35,476
Without any condition

1006
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:40,481
But it all was a dream

1007
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:46,475
Of my enamored soul

1008
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:51,492
Just like any other

1009
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:55,496
You played with my love

1010
01:48:57,531 --> 01:49:00,501
Just like any other

1011
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:05,506
Just like a tart

1012
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:10,511
You played with my life

1013
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:12,679
Whisk.

1014
01:49:13,113 --> 01:49:15,082
A bottle of brandy.

1015
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:19,520
And if the heart cries

1016
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:24,525
I ask Aim to be stiff

1017
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,530
For a love like yours

1018
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:35,525
I find them in the street

1019
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:00,560
What's up, buddy?

1020
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,567
How are things, blond guy?

1021
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,630
Not him!

1022
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:25,646
Her eyes shut

1023
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:31,684
And yet the world keeps on going

1024
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:34,655
Her mouth that was mine

1025
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:38,659
Kisses me no more

1026
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:42,663
Extinguished are the echoes

1027
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:46,666
Of her sonorous laugh

1028
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:50,671
And it's cruel, this silence

1029
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:54,675
Which makes me feel so bad

1030
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,711
Mine was the compassionate

1031
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:01,714
Sweetness of her hands

1032
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:03,716
Which gave to my sorrow

1033
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:06,687
Caresses of kindness

1034
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:11,724
And now that I evoke her

1035
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:14,695
Overwhelmed in my despair

1036
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:20,690
The braided streaming tears

1037
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:25,706
Refuse to flow

1038
01:52:27,074 --> 01:52:31,077
And I don't have the consolation

1039
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:34,047
Of being able to cry

1040
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:39,752
All because your wings

1041
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:42,755
So cruelly burned out life

1042
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:45,758
All because that sinister

1043
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:47,727
Grimace of fate

1044
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:51,732
I wanted to embrace her

1045
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:57,727
But Death defeated me

1046
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:03,776
Oh, how [ hurt, and so deep within is my strife!

1047
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:07,780
I know that now unfamiliar faces will come

1048
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:11,784
With their charity of relief for my torment

1049
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,786
All is but a lie

1050
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,755
A lie is their lament

1051
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:20,761
Today my heart

1052
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:26,756
Is all alone

1053
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:30,803
Like dogs of prey

1054
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:32,805
The treacherous spirits

1055
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:34,807
Watching over my loved one

1056
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:37,810
Galloped after her

1057
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:39,812
And hidden in the luster

1058
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:42,815
Of her good glance

1059
01:53:42,816 --> 01:53:44,817
The crouching Death

1060
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:47,788
Was marking her tempo

1061
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:52,825
In vain I encouraged

1062
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:54,827
Feverishly a hope

1063
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:57,830
That pierce into my raw flesh

1064
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:00,801
With its claws of pain

1065
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,837
And meanwhile out in the street

1066
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:06,806
In frenzied uproar

1067
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:10,843
The carnival of the world

1068
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:13,814
Was laughing and enjoying

1069
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:17,850
Making fun of fate

1070
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:20,821
Which robbed me of her love

1071
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:24,857
All because your wings

1072
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:27,828
So cruelly burned out life

1073
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:31,864
All because that sinister

1074
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:33,833
Grimace of fate

1075
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:37,838
I wanted to embrace her

1076
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:41,842
But Death defeated me

1077
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:47,880
Oh, how I hurt and so deep within is my strife!

1078
01:54:47,881 --> 01:54:51,884
I know that now unfamiliar faces will come

1079
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:55,888
With their charity of relief for my torment

1080
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:57,857
All is but a lie

1081
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:00,860
A lie is their lament

1082
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:04,864
Today my heart

1083
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:12,862
Is all alone

1084
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:19,912
May the soul of the Heron rest in peace.

1085
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:23,916
May the Lord release her from the pain and
give her rest.

1086
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:25,918
- Rest in peace.
- Amen.

1087
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:28,921
Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be
Thy Name.

1088
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:32,925
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

1089
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:36,929
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive
us our debts,

1090
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,933
as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into
temptation,

1091
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,935
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

1092
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:44,937
May the Lord give her eternal rest.

1093
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:46,939
May perpetual light shine for her.

1094
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:48,941
- Rest in peace.
- Amen.

1095
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:50,943
May the Lord give her eternal rest.

1096
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:52,945
May perpetual light shine for her.

1097
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:54,947
- Rest in peace.
- Amen.

1098
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:56,949
May the Lord give her eternal rest.

1099
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,951
May perpetual light shine for her.

1100
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:00,953
- Rest in peace.
- Amen.

1101
01:56:00,954 --> 01:56:02,955
May the Lord give her eternal rest.

1102
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:04,957
May perpetual light shine for her.

1103
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,926
- Rest in peace.
- Amen.

1104
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:09,962
May the Lord give her eternal rest.

1105
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:11,964
May perpetual light shine for her.

1106
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:13,933
- Rest in peace.
- Amen.

1107
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:57,157
I'm in prison, serving my sentence

1108
01:59:58,191 --> 02:00:01,161
Sentence imposed by society

1109
02:00:02,195 --> 02:00:06,154
I'm afflicted and ashamed

1110
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:10,202
But I'm to serve it all alone

1111
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:14,206
My guitar, that little orphan, plays no more

1112
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:17,177
And though late, I now know it's real

1113
02:00:18,211 --> 02:00:22,214
That the one who plays so close to fire

1114
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:25,185
If does not live cautiously, he will burn

1115
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:30,222
I only ask my friends in the outside

1116
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:35,227
To guard against liquor and its evil

1117
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:38,198
For the only one, last and foremost

1118
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:42,202
Is forever the word Freedom

1119
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:03,255
I'm in prison, serving my sentence

1120
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:06,226
Sentence imposed by society

1121
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:10,230
I'm afflicted and ashamed

1122
02:01:12,265 --> 02:01:15,235
But I'm to serve it all alone

1123
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:19,271
My guitar, that little orphan, plays no more

1124
02:01:19,272 --> 02:01:23,275
And though late, I now know it's real

1125
02:01:23,276 --> 02:01:27,279
That the one who plays so close to fire

1126
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,250
If does not live cautiously, he will burn

1127
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:35,287
I only ask my friends in the outside

1128
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:39,247
To guard against liquor and its evil

1129
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:43,263
For the only one, last and foremost

1130
02:01:44,297 --> 02:01:47,267
Is forever the word Freedom

1131
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:53,305
Freedom

1132
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:57,265
Freedom
