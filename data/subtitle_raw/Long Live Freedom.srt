VIVA LA LIBERT√Å
<i>Long Live Freedom</i>

2
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,857
- Is there a bathroom? 
- If you told me earlier, there was one in the VIP room

3
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,775
- Well I need it now.
- Then we have to go back.

4
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:37,109
- We are very late.
- If you like, there is the service one.

<i>Real time survey
Enrico Olivieri   17%</i>

6
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:24,195
Olivieri!
Do you know why you are silent?

7
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:29,508
Because you never had anything
fucking worth saying! Ever!

8
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:34,197
Didn't you get that you are
ruining the party?

9
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:40,031
And that we will stop you?
Didn't you get that you must go?

10
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:43,470
You must go!
You must go!

11
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:49,096
You're a scourge sent
to shut our mouth!

12
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:52,014
To make us forever harmless servants!

13
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,619
But Time is gentleman,
Secretary.

14
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,786
Sooner or later shame
will paralyze you.

15
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,808
"In the dark night
sparkle stars" (Latin)

16
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:10,351
You must go!

17
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:11,602
Enough!

18
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,602
Even Jesus Christ didn't want
to be killed without a trial...

19
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:27,228
because it's much more shameful
to die through a trial

20
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:31,396
rather than for a rebellion...

21
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:34,522
after all...unjust.

22
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:39,002
Looks good tomorrow?

23
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,795
Then, thanks.

24
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:51,400
Her name is Federica Civatti, 44 years old
and none of us know her.

25
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:54,839
Someone sent her on purpose.
You mean them?

26
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,881
Who else?

27
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:01,403
- Why did she speak Latin?
- She is a high school professor.

28
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:10,050
This is the data you asked for
the meeting with the European Left.

29
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:13,176
There is also a draft of the speech.

30
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:44,531
Have you got something to say to me?

31
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,970
Nothing

32
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:51,096
See you Andrea, take care.

33
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:41,201
- Yes?! 
<i>- Hi, I called earlier but no answer.</i>

34
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:43,702
- I just came back.
<i>- I am in Beijing.</i>

35
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:48,182
<i>I stayed till the conclusion of the
convention, I'm exhausted.</i>

36
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:50,267
<i>Tonight there was a meeting
at the embassy.</i>

37
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,684
<i>I didn't feel like, but I had to go.
How are you?</i>

38
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:59,540
Nothing important. I go to bed early
...as usual.

39
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,207
OLIVIERI: CHALLENGED AT
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

40
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,188
<i>I saw on the news about that
woman who defied you</i>

41
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,730
<i>Are you listening?</i>

42
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,023
Yes

43
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:12,670
<i>You're tired?! Don't get upset.
You know how this country is.</i>

44
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:16,733
<i>I recommend, have a good sleep.
A kiss.</i>

45
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:19,130
- A kiss to you too.
- Bye.

46
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:25,277
- Sorry for the time.
- Come in.

47
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:28,716
I sleep little.

48
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,738
You are fearful
you are worried...

49
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:42,780
...and want to be comforted,
but that it's impossible.

50
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:48,302
We were wrong, we were really
imbeciles to focus on him.

51
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:51,636
But there was no alternative,
he was and still is the best.

52
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:54,867
He is, so much so that he'll
save us from a slow death.

53
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:56,639
What do you mean?

54
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,015
After him, there will be no trace of us!

55
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,473
OLIVIERI
The courage to change

56
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:42,474
<i>Opposition is dead
and it's your fault</i>

57
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:52,579
<i>You are wasting our best years.
You talk about change,</i>

58
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,768
<i>party leaders must change first.</i>

59
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:59,143
<i>It is a sad situation! Enough!
Every year the same story!</i>

60
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,602
<i>Ridiculous and embarrassing!</i>

61
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:52,166
- Rocchi, where are you?
<i>- At home, why?</i>

62
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:56,750
His Honor called me at midnight to
say that he would come on his own.

63
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:59,564
<i>- Has he changed his mind?</i>
- Sorry, but why didn't you tell me?

64
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:03,210
His Honor said that he told you already.
Sir, what should I do? Should I come?

65
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,128
No, no, stay there.
Eventually I call you back.

66
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:12,170
But how? Last night he was calm,
he was going to sleep.

67
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:15,713
- What could have happened?
- Nothing, don't you worry, Anna.

68
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,151
It's just confusion, you'll see he is coming.
Sorry I called you, I apologize

69
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,506
Have a good trip.

70
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:49,361
Andrea!
What happens?

71
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,862
- No, nothing,
- How nothing? Why isn't he here?

72
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,676
- He had a health problem, cannot come.
- Are you joking?

73
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,344
No, I swear.

74
00:09:57,483 --> 00:10:00,504
- Call him I want to talk to him!
- No, it's off, now you can't.

75
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03,318
- Why? Where is he?
- In consultation with a doctor.

76
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,777
He'll call me later.

77
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:08,007
- Rather, you should communicate that there
was something unforeseen. - Of course.

78
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:34,675
Enrico!

79
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,697
Enrico!

80
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,531
I go to take a look.

81
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:15,616
<i>The Prime Minister said ironically
"When fatigue is more than</i>

82
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:16,762
<i>pleasure, it's time to stop"</i>

83
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,387
Is it a message from His Honor?

84
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,993
No, no. It is something
I left behind.

85
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,910
- Shall we go?
- Yes, please.

86
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,078
<i>I am ready to fight...</i>

87
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,308
<i>but I need a few days on my own to
get back on track.</i>

88
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:49,476
<i>Andrea will be able to justify my absence
without alarming anybody.</i>

89
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:51,977
Are you listening Anna?

90
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,582
Yes, keep going.

91
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,604
<i>I will be in touch,
do not worry</i>

92
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:00,418
It is the price a public figure 
must pay sooner or later.

93
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:03,648
Nothing else.

94
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,003
<i>Where could he be?</i>

95
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,566
I have no idea.

96
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,754
Nobody comes to mind?
A friend?

97
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,151
A politician has no friend.

98
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,423
Is it OK?

99
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,257
What's his name?

100
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:59,800
Enrico, he's an old friend who I
have not seen for a long time.

101
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,739
He looks lost, has not said
a single word since he arrived.

102
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:09,594
I think he needs some rest.
I don't know.

103
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,157
Ah, Danielle!

104
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:36,054
Sorry to show up here all
of a sudden.

105
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,243
I must have created you some
embarrassment.

106
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:40,744
I just need some time,
to breathe.

107
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:41,995
Yes, yes

108
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:46,371
Tell me the truth. Do you think
I am making a mistake?

109
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:50,747
Yes. I think you're running away,
that you are making a mistake

110
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:52,310
No, I am not running away.

111
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:56,895
I am perfectly aware of the consequences
that will be triggered in Rome.

112
00:13:56,896 --> 00:14:00,438
I want to see what these
morons will do without me.

113
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:12,209
You look better without glasses.

114
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,169
Your husband, your daughter
where are they?

115
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,399
They left early, she goes to school,
he goes to work.

116
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,900
What does he do?

117
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:24,922
- Director.
- Television?

118
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:27,735
Cinema.

119
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,820
Do I know him?

120
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:36,592
Mung!

121
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,489
He's one of the directors I prefer!

122
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,406
You are not the only one, he's
adored like a rock star.

123
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:47,220
- Did you tell him about me?
- Sure!

124
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,971
- What did he say?
- He said...that you have a beautiful face

125
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,701
- Good morning everybody.
- Good morning

126
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,577
I think it is clear the reason why
the urgency of this meeting today

127
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,870
In light of Secretary's health.

128
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:26,288
We have to manage a temporary substitution
It's needless to try to hide

129
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,309
That it arrives at a particularly
difficult moment.

130
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,394
Good morning to everybody,
sorry for the delay.

131
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,728
I had to make copies of
Secretary's speech.

132
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:35,979
Here the machine is broken.

133
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,834
I want to make sure that even today
you get his voice loud and clear

134
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,815
Here you have it.

135
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:49,211
Bottini, tell us something.
We are all ears.

136
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,608
Well, Enrico is well
and greets everyone.

137
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:55,984
And you'll be happy to know that
he'll return to his roles in a few days.

138
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:58,381
- How many?
- I do not know for sure.

139
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:02,861
Doctors talk of a few days, you know,
with the usual caution in these cases.

140
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,842
Then why doesn't he give interviews?

141
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:08,176
If he doesn't, he will induce the
suspicion for something serious.

142
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:11,823
Firstly, for understandable
privacy reasons.

143
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:15,053
And there is an extremely lucid
political assessment,

144
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:19,325
that is, images of his 
hospitalization may suggest...

145
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,409
...a party in bad health.

146
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:26,619
Things move differently from the way
you intellectuals see them, Bottini

147
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,641
For me this illness is
an unexpected gift.

148
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:31,725
Then I ask you,
why don't we use it?

149
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:34,018
People love human factor,
gossip.

150
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,831
They even love shit, Francesco, it doesn't
mean you ought to give it to them

151
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,374
I say we have to talk
directly with him.

152
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,542
Meanwhile we make him feel our
affection, and then perhaps...

153
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,980
it is better to deal with him about the
public opinion question, isn't it?

154
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:51,835
- Let's call him?! What do you say?
- Yes, I call him.

155
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,920
No, let me call him.

156
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,671
<i>I'm not in, I cannot answer</i>

157
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:06,422
<i>It is perfectly useless
to leave messages</i>

158
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,506
Too much stress,
too many ambushes

159
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,570
- You'll see, he'll call you.
- I doubt it.

160
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,591
- Perhaps there is a person who can help us.
- Who?

161
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:28,821
- Giovanni, his brother.
- The professor, but isn't he....

162
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:31,947
No, he has left the madhouse.
They believe he's harmless.

163
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,427
The only time he told me about
he said they do not see each other

164
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,553
Do you know why?

165
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:47,575
I realized that I know nothing
about his young life...

166
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:50,389
...except the bullshit reported
in the newspapers.

167
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,681
The listless child prodigy,
his passion for film,

168
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:54,766
his sudden infatuation
for politics...

169
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:56,642
Bullshit!

170
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:04,247
Within minutes the president will go
through the Hall of World Maps.

171
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,852
And you could meet him.
If you like to follow me.

172
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,103
Thanks

173
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,042
Mister President.

174
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:40,501
It seems to me things are not very clear

175
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:42,065
Is he really sick?

176
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,566
Sure, it is a minor operation

177
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,546
A trifle...which will have
no consequences.

178
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,839
Then why all this mystery?

179
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:52,381
I know Oliveri since he went
into politics and...

180
00:19:55,716 --> 00:20:00,299
Right now the country cannot afford
inactivity by the opposition.

181
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,467
There are those who cannot wait
to take advantage of the situation.

182
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:09,780
The Secretary is aware of that,
I assure you it is only a matter of days.

183
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,844
<i>An unexpected condition imposed
few days of hospitalization...</i>

184
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,928
<i>to have a health check-up
to MP Enrico Oliveri...</i>

185
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,054
<i>Secretary of main opposition party.</i>

186
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,618
<i>Causes of Mr. Olivieri's health
problems are unknown.</i>

187
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:28,744
<i>His colleagues speak of
overwork...</i>

188
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:30,828
<i>the MP, 50 years old
with a lean physique</i>

189
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,913
<i>has always been in good health.</i>

190
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:34,789
<i>The President 
of Italian Republic</i>

191
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,810
<i>has sent his best wishes for
a speedy recovery</i>

192
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,542
<i>Giovanni Ernani is the pseudonym behind
which hides one of the greatest...</i>

193
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,937
<i>Italian philosophers. Born in Rome
on the 12th of August 1959</i>

194
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:18,230
<i>Who is it?</i>

195
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:21,773
Hello, I am looking for information
on a patient of yours.

196
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:24,378
Professor Giovanni Ernani.

197
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:47,192
Excuse me, Crocceta Street?

198
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:49,380
See those houses over there?

199
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,923
I am seeking Professor Ernani

200
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:29,799
Pardon, who is seeking him?

201
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:38,133
It's a long story, 
a private and personal matter.

202
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:41,051
I am sorry, but the professor 
is not at home.

203
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:46,781
It's about his brother, Enrico

204
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,032
Is he dead?

205
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,804
No, no, no, no my God!

206
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,993
I am sorry, it wasn't my intention
to scare you.

207
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:53,660
Why should I get scared?

208
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:58,557
Excuse me, can we get inside?
Can we talk?

209
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:02,829
If you like...

210
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:06,372
Please. Leave it open.

211
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,519
As you can see, I am not
ready to receive.

212
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:27,207
You like books?
Take it, take it!

213
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:31,479
At first it will seem
a little tough.

214
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,064
But then, little by little, even one
like you can succeed to understand it.

215
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:39,606
- Take it.
- Thank you.

216
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,878
Excuse me professor, I wish to ask you...

217
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:46,587
If we talk, there is a small
restaurant just ten minutes from here.

218
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:47,839
It's good food.

219
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:50,860
This time at the clinic
dinner was over.

220
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:56,903
Any dinner tonight?
Not hungry.

221
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:59,821
Poor him, tell him to come.

222
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:02,114
He cannot stay locked in the room!

223
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:06,073
He can come whenever he likes,
he is not locked up.

224
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:08,678
Maybe He found
his ideal condition.

225
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:12,013
At night he could go out
and get some air.

226
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:13,993
And why not during the day?

227
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,598
He is a person a bit special,

228
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:20,974
nobody knows he is In Paris,
someone could recognize him.

229
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:25,038
Why? Who is he?

230
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,851
An Italian politician,
very important.

231
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:32,331
- Like Hollande or Sarkozy?
- Like Obama!

232
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,416
I am Mung, 
please to meet you, take a sit.

233
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,063
- Sit down.
- I do not want to intrude.

234
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,147
I finished my medicine drugs.

235
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:49,002
If you could tell me
of a chemist open...

236
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:51,503
No problem, I can even go myself,
and it might be more prudent

237
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:55,150
No. I'd rather walk a little.

238
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:58,172
I don't think there is any
particular risk at night.

239
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,194
I go with him, 
I like having some fresh air.

240
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:04,841
Thanks, very kind.

241
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:08,800
Professor, I do not know
how you can help us

242
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,197
Your brother must have asked
someone for a place to stay

243
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:14,010
Certainly someone outside
your circle. However...

244
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:17,241
it's very difficult to enter his head.

245
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:20,783
Enrico never managed
to be truly himself.

246
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,242
I am sorry

247
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:45,055
Your Honor!

248
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,494
I'm glad you've recovered.

249
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:54,224
Do you mind if we exchange a few
words? Maybe a little interview.

250
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:57,454
Obviously, before publication,
I will let you review it!

251
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,893
- Please.
- Thank you.

252
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:11,206
And that gray hair...
Is it due to your recent illness?

253
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:15,582
It is a message to Italians:
be honest, stop dying yourself!

254
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:23,188
Evelina, in a few
days he will be home.

255
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:24,647
<i>Andrea, but there is no margin left!</i>

256
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:27,356
The doctor has advised
for a few days of rest.

257
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,899
Your voters do not have many
reason to rejoice.

258
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,108
I read harsh criticism on
your blog and the party's.

259
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:38,297
My voters are right to be
tired of me.

260
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,381
Me too I often get tired of them!

261
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:44,341
Perhaps, sir, I better
do not write this.

262
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:47,050
No, no, no...What's more,
write this as well:

263
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,801
If politicians are mediocre is
because their electors are mediocre.

264
00:26:50,802 --> 00:26:53,406
And if they are thieves, it is because
their electors are thieves...

265
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:54,449
Or they would like to be.

266
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:57,158
<i>You should immediately contact
him, right?</i>

267
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,389
<i>You know I'm the only one
he has confidence with!</i>

268
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:03,827
<i>Andrea?</i>

269
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:10,807
There is always something to uncover
in the past of someone powerful.

270
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:12,788
Someone powerful can always...

271
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:15,809
be crucified at the right moment.

272
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,581
Fear is the music of democracy!

273
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,249
Fear?

274
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:23,313
Someone powerful tries to challenge it.

275
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:26,230
He has the illusion to tame it
and in the end he's attracted by it.

276
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:30,606
For this reason there is no western democracy
that can do without Secret Services.

277
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:35,086
And it is exactly for that very reason
that politicians sooner or later

278
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,588
try to fake their own biography.

279
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,089
Lookalikes, copies, fakes

280
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:44,048
In parliament there isn't a single
jerk who knows to be one.

281
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,820
And now, please let me eat in peace.

282
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:50,404
I do not know how to thank you, I hope
I have not bothered you much.

283
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:51,447
No problem.

284
00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:55,094
Excuse me

285
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:57,178
What the fuck illness did he have?

286
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,471
He seems different!

287
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:02,284
This interview is a bomb!

288
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,765
He fell right into the trap! 
I have not done this game for years.

289
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:15,307
When young, my brother and I
exchanged each other often.

290
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:18,433
I could imitate him without being
discovered, he couldn't.

291
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,122
What's the name of that journalist?

292
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,560
Arrighi, from Corriere della Sera.

293
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:28,957
You don't mind if an article comes out,
do you?

294
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,542
It may even be useful.

295
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,209
What's up?

296
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:42,190
Did he show up?

297
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:43,441
Not exactly.

298
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,004
Maybe I found a solution,

299
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,922
but you must agree too.

300
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,110
Yes, I'm in.

301
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:18,132
And you know why?

302
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,487
To bother him.

303
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:22,718
But I warn you, you are putting the
party in the hands of a madman.

304
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,635
He maybe mad, but he's got method.

305
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:28,657
And above all he's funny.

306
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:36,679
Pleasure, 
Giovanni Ernani.

307
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:41,264
Anna Oliveri.

308
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,598
Are you going to show him the house....
the room?

309
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,620
Can I leave you two alone?

310
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,392
Excuse me.

311
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,559
If you like, I was thinking of
letting you stay here...

312
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:23,665
Come on, my dear, 
let's be more friendly.

313
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:28,666
That's your cupboard.
As you see...

314
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,479
Enrico has taken almost nothing.

315
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:35,439
Here are his glasses.

316
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:54,710
- Did I scare you?
- So identical to him.

317
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,149
Yes, I can be if I want.

318
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:02,942
- Any service personnel?
- A house maid comes for a few hours.

319
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:04,818
Your brother does not like having people
at home.

320
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,277
I do not mind.

321
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:08,882
Perhaps It might be better to ask her
to stay all day.

322
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:14,300
Do you leave him here?

323
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,259
I can't take him with me!

324
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,427
I would not have time.

325
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:28,574
I can't deal with his problems
while I am working.

326
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:37,950
In short, I'm not his babysitter!

327
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:40,139
But he is here for you!

328
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,869
You know, you are one of the filmmakers
I love most.

329
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:49,411
- Danielle told me that.
- Really?

330
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:52,850
I would have never thought of having a fan
among Italian politicians.

331
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:56,080
Maybe I'm the
exception to the rule.

332
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,248
In reality politics and cinema
are not so far away.

333
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:02,749
They are worlds in which deception
and genius coexist.

334
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:05,250
And it's often difficult to distinguish.

335
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,001
Here we are.

336
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:13,377
Sir, this drug
does not exist in France,

337
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,149
I can find a similar one

338
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,796
But you should specify to me
the pathology it was prescribed for.

339
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,859
You suffer from depression, don't you?

340
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:28,694
Yes, he suffers from depression.

341
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:30,570
I'm feeling...

342
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:24,217
This piano is mine

343
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:25,364
You know it?

344
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:28,490
- No, I don't.
- Your husband never learnt.

345
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:30,470
I know, I have never seen him play.

346
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,283
- I apologize for waking you up.
- Never mind.

347
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:44,326
- Hello sir, is His Honor back?
- Of course!

348
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,515
That's better.

349
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,453
Welcome back Your Honor.

350
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:26,204
We can go.

351
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:44,330
Here it is the interview.

352
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,477
Ah, really?

353
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:49,436
<i>Oliveri: Fear is the music of
democracy.</i>

354
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't like the picture,

355
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:53,709
it doesn't look like me at all.

356
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,523
No. The interview is extraordinary,
it's great, really.

357
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,232
Hegel used to say that reading
newspapers is...

358
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:00,796
...layman's prayer.

359
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,026
Right! A real shit!

360
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,590
I never read them.

361
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,674
LEMIDAL
(antipsychotic)

362
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:15,800
They will ask a number of questions.
They want to know what you had.

363
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:19,447
Try to stick to what
we have established.

364
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:20,802
What should I talk about?

365
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:22,782
This is the speech, just read it.

366
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:25,179
It is a forum organized by
the Faculty of Economics.

367
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,722
There will be plenty of youngsters. Will
talk an economist, a unionist

368
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:32,681
and one of those journalists who know
everything and do not understand a thing.

369
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:36,848
And besides, there will be Rezza from the government,
they want to understand in which direction we are going.

370
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:40,182
And want to know if we are going to make a 
"mea culpa" on social pacts.

371
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:42,683
I think I'll improvise.

372
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:49,143
Are you mad?

373
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:52,165
So they say!

374
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:03,624
Your Honor Oliveri,
is it true that you will resign?

375
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,292
Have you read the surveys, Your Honor?

376
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:10,501
You return after a mysterious
absence, and immediately surprise us

377
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,940
proposing a change of line. Is it
repentance for the disastrous outcome

378
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:17,482
of your leadership?
A belated admission of guilt?

379
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:18,942
What's this journalist's heading?

380
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,859
I'm Corsini, Your Honor,
you know me very well.

381
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,985
Corsini, tell me the truth.
Do you ever tell the truth?

382
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:26,341
What do you mean?

383
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:29,362
I just said the truth
about my party.

384
00:36:29,364 --> 00:36:31,030
Would you ever write the truth
about your editor?

385
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:33,219
Well, we are an independent newspaper.

386
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,511
True, in the header it's
written "independent"

387
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:37,908
Thus you begin to lie from
the very beginning.

388
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:41,451
Are you familiar with the paradox of
Epimenide's liar?

389
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,952
Excuse Your Honor
I asked you a question.

390
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,349
And I have just demonstrated that
you do not deserve an answer.

391
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,329
- Your Honor!
- Your Honor!

392
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:52,184
Not too heavy?

393
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:58,540
Wait here, I'll get the key
from the neighbor.

394
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:06,041
Keep an eye on him, 
so he doesn't make problems.

395
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,271
Today I will talk...

396
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,751
...of catastrophe.

397
00:37:20,835 --> 00:37:24,169
A great French philosopher
said that catastrophe

398
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,191
is the only true resource of south.

399
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:30,629
Today we can see how
that has become

400
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,609
<i>DOCTOR CERTIFICATE.
The patient Giovanni Ernani shows no more</i>

401
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,631
<i>interpretive delirium of reality...
LEMIDAL to be continued in equal doses.</i>

402
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:38,028
Today we realize how it has become
the only real resource of Italian society,

403
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,425
which it seems to have for itself
as a program only...

404
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,405
...to live on the edge of abyss.

405
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:48,240
Today we keep hearing of new 
catastrophes, real or alleged ones

406
00:37:49,907 --> 00:37:54,803
We keep looking at politics, 
at industry...

407
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:57,929
that thrive on catastrophe.

408
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:02,618
I wonder how people can
tolerate all this.

409
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:07,098
Indeed they begin to have enough.

410
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:12,932
And...talking of catastrophe...

411
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:16,475
I want to say also a word...

412
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,872
about...my party

413
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:27,519
We should have been the first
to stop this bad habit.

414
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,707
We have been very soft,

415
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:34,188
uncertain, undecided,
vacuous, available.

416
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:38,147
In a word: Accomplices!

417
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:42,210
We have been without a clear voice!

418
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:47,732
Although from time to time
someone tried to speak up,

419
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,858
people heard nothing.

420
00:38:53,672 --> 00:38:57,005
I can assure you that from now
on, it will never be like this.

421
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:03,048
I am here so that 
tomorrow cannot be said

422
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:10,341
times were dark,
because they were silent!

423
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:43,050
Mom told me that you've
known each other for a long time.

424
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:44,301
Yes

425
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:47,427
About...

426
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,720
25 years.

427
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:53,679
We met in Cannes.

428
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,868
Are you a film lover too?

429
00:39:57,744 --> 00:39:58,785
Yes.

430
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:01,599
Were you together?

431
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:11,704
Look.

432
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:21,080
Dad said that
you're still in love with mom.

433
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:25,040
it shows from your look.

434
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,916
- Welcome!
- Welcome back, all right?

435
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,167
Yes, thanks.

436
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:44,730
You are  back in great shape.
Well, what a pleasure!

437
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:46,085
You are different!

438
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:49,211
So different that, when I heard
about party criticism,

439
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:53,171
I was doubting you were the one
who brought us at this point!

440
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:55,880
Who says that I am the same person?

441
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:04,215
Listen, Nolfo called me. He is
concerned about our silence.

442
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:08,278
Concerned about the versions
circulated on your absence.

443
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:12,237
Without the alliance with the center Nolfo's center,
we just lose the election.

444
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,905
No question about it.

445
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:44,531
It's spring,
subtle veils of mist

446
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:48,699
Also surround the nameless mountain.

447
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:55,887
Is it mine this figure whose back
is walking away in the rain?

448
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,034
- Here it is, here it is!
- Your Honor good morning!

449
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,119
Welcome back Your Honor Oliveri!

450
00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:37,870
Can you tell which is the decision
on the electoral alliance?

451
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,162
I'll make you a question:

452
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:41,518
To defeat this government,

453
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,602
which as you know is the worst
in our history,

454
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,166
is it right even to partner with the devil?

455
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:48,188
Who would the devil be, Nolfo?

456
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,064
No, I am talking of the devil himself.

457
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:52,773
The devil in person.
He exists you know?

458
00:42:52,774 --> 00:42:54,961
Only this catholic country never
believed it.

459
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,629
It has always preferred substitutes!

460
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,130
However, I fear that this man, 
the devil,

461
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:01,215
has already partnered with our adversary.

462
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:04,236
In real terms, Your Honor,
would you make the alliance or not?

463
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:08,404
The consensus...my boy,
the consensus is something serious.

464
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:10,072
It has nothing to do with alliances.

465
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:13,719
The only possible alliance today is
with people's consciousness.

466
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:36,220
Is it mine...this figure whose back
...is walking away...in the fog?

467
00:43:39,137 --> 00:43:40,804
In the rain!

468
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,930
What is it, a puzzle?

469
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:46,015
It's a "haiku"
(traditional Japanese poetry)

470
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,078
I'm looking for Danielle, have you seen her?

471
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,267
- Danielle...
the script girl? - Yes.

472
00:44:02,268 --> 00:44:04,455
- Up there
- Thank you.

473
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,560
Close the door.

474
00:44:26,645 --> 00:44:28,416
You can't stay here!

475
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,813
Wait downstairs.

476
00:44:57,897 --> 00:44:59,668
<i>"NEVER WORDS WERE CLEARER"</i>

477
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:01,752
<i>"the only possible alliance is 
with people's consciousness"</i>

478
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,899
It's right, you look good.

479
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,254
Thank you.

480
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:17,797
Hello?

481
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:20,715
Hello?

482
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:22,903
What is it?

483
00:45:25,196 --> 00:45:26,550
I can hear breathing.

484
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:34,051
It's you!

485
00:45:35,094 --> 00:45:37,594
Hello, I'm Mara,
Danielle sent me.

486
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:40,303
If you want to attend
shooting, we start now.

487
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:45,200
As we begin to roll,
make no noise, do not move,

488
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:46,868
otherwise I get reprimanded.

489
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:50,306
You'll see, it's a rather
particular scene.

490
00:45:58,432 --> 00:46:00,203
- Good morning Your Honor.
- Hello, dear.

491
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:02,183
Outside there is a
crowd waiting for you.

492
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:03,539
Really? Thanks

493
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:29,790
Bye.

494
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:37,499
Enrico, you must stop
looking at me like that.

495
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,271
Apart, someone could see it.

496
00:46:39,584 --> 00:46:42,605
Also that story...is over.

497
00:46:43,023 --> 00:46:44,169
Isn't it?!

498
00:47:27,086 --> 00:47:28,545
What's up Bottini?

499
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:36,567
Our president wants a meeting next week.

500
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:39,380
I could not avoid it.

501
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:40,840
Good!

502
00:47:42,716 --> 00:47:44,799
Professor, you must go alone,

503
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,154
it's a private talk.

504
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,197
All the better.

505
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:12,615
- Hi Enrico.
- Good night dear.

506
00:48:12,616 --> 00:48:14,699
- Do you need anything?
- No.

507
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,138
So I am going out...
see you tomorrow.

508
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:19,493
About the appointments?

509
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:22,931
This afternoon I have something to do,
cancel all obligations.

510
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:30,745
This venue really sucks!

511
00:48:30,746 --> 00:48:32,204
Whoever designed it?

512
00:48:32,205 --> 00:48:33,455
what?...You did.

513
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:35,956
You were so happy when we opened!

514
00:48:36,478 --> 00:48:37,832
Where are you going in such a hurry?

515
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,917
Bottini, were you ever young?

516
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,272
Or were you born like that?

517
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,960
- Who is it?
- Giovanni.

518
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:57,107
Bottini, let me introduce my friends.

519
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,588
I had a nightmare,
but it's finished.

520
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:23,047
Thanks.

521
00:51:26,485 --> 00:51:28,465
You have children, Enrico?

522
00:51:28,466 --> 00:51:30,132
No

523
00:51:36,071 --> 00:51:38,154
Can you drive?

524
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:41,593
Yes, why?

525
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:46,490
Tomorrow I meet with my friends
and then go skiing.

526
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:49,928
Mom asked a driver
to take me.

527
00:51:51,283 --> 00:51:53,054
Can you take me?

528
00:51:53,055 --> 00:51:54,097
Sure!

529
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:57,640
- Can you turn off the lights?
- OK.

530
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,953
- Good night
- Good night.

531
00:52:33,996 --> 00:52:36,912
- Do you still go the movies?
- Not really.

532
00:52:38,684 --> 00:52:41,289
The last time was...
three years ago.

533
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:45,144
You politicians don't have a healthy lifestyle!

534
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:46,499
Right.

535
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:50,042
I try to see at least
four films a week.

536
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:52,751
Your mother was like you.

537
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,419
This week I have seen

538
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,545
"E.T", "Big Hopes"

539
00:52:57,546 --> 00:52:59,733
"Avatar"...and

540
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:03,589
"Last Tango in Paris"

541
00:53:04,423 --> 00:53:07,027
Whoa! That's for adults
don't you think?

542
00:53:07,028 --> 00:53:10,674
I was sure! You and sex
don't go along very well, do you?!

543
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:18,175
Hello.

544
00:53:18,176 --> 00:53:19,322
Hello.

545
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:21,302
- I am Simon's mother.
- What a pleasure!

546
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:23,178
- Are you with Helene?
- Yes.

547
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,658
But I know you!

548
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:32,034
- I have seen you on TV!
- I think you are mistaken madam.

549
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:45,369
- I will miss you so much,
- Me too.

550
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,703
Nice trip.

551
00:53:56,725 --> 00:53:58,600
- Me too!
- Me too!

552
00:53:59,122 --> 00:54:00,789
No, me too.

553
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,685
My dear old friend is back.

554
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:20,791
I feared a lot for you.
And I feared much for all of us.

555
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:24,021
We are few left to reason.

556
00:54:24,855 --> 00:54:30,168
All around I only see stoned people,
thieves and bankers.

557
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,148
You said it right:

558
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:34,024
it is a catastrophe!

559
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,671
We're asked concrete actions!

560
00:54:38,505 --> 00:54:40,693
What would you do?

561
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:46,215
I would try not to step on the dignity
of those who cannot defend themselves.

562
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,382
If Europe and the world have become
a miserable shopping store,

563
00:54:50,383 --> 00:54:52,779
Then what are we?
You, President?

564
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:56,218
But it's not my fault!
It is politics that has...

565
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:57,990
...disappeared!

566
00:54:59,136 --> 00:55:01,949
To be or not to be,
that is the question.

567
00:55:02,992 --> 00:55:07,263
Is it better to be as if we
have already disappeared...

568
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,451
Where are you going?

569
00:55:17,785 --> 00:55:21,223
Or to disappear altogether
to come back being?

570
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:29,141
Where are you?

571
00:55:34,975 --> 00:55:36,433
He disappeared!

572
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,559
How do you feel?

573
00:55:56,852 --> 00:56:00,498
Do not ask about me,
not worth it.

574
00:56:00,499 --> 00:56:02,791
Eventually, you tell me something.

575
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,958
Well, have you seen?

576
00:56:06,959 --> 00:56:10,397
Let's say that the rest was
good for our Secretary

577
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:13,002
that doesn't miss a beat and is climbing
back in the surveys.

578
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,982
Do not pull my leg!

579
00:56:14,983 --> 00:56:17,171
Until the other day Oliveri
was a boiled fish

580
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:20,193
and now he is a shark
that spares no one.

581
00:56:20,194 --> 00:56:23,006
I do not believe in miracles.

582
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:27,070
If I tell you, you are the only one
to know it, besides me.

583
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:28,321
Agree?

584
00:56:28,322 --> 00:56:31,655
If you do not trust someone in this
condition, who can you trust?

585
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:34,365
In fact, I tell you the truth,
just because you're dying.

586
00:56:34,366 --> 00:56:36,032
Up yours!

587
00:56:47,388 --> 00:56:49,367
We are in deep shit!

588
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,764
Just today that the art department
is under pressure.

589
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:54,265
- What happened?
- Michel got sick.

590
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:57,391
- Who is Michel?
- The assistant toolmaker.

591
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:02,913
- Ready Enrico?
- Yes

592
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:09,059
One, two, three...

593
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,892
Slowly.

594
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:25,622
Is that okay?

595
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,144
I did not think you would do so well

596
00:58:28,749 --> 00:58:32,499
If you want to take a bath with me tonight,
I have got the key to the pool.

597
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,438
But we have to do it after nine,

598
00:58:44,064 --> 00:58:46,668
when access to customers
is forbidden.

599
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:06,356
Lady Chancellor is waiting. Please.

600
00:59:42,399 --> 00:59:44,378
It is a real pleasure to meet you

601
00:59:45,004 --> 00:59:50,108
And exchange views on the current,
difficult situation in which we find ourselves.

602
00:59:51,776 --> 00:59:55,526
In this dark period your always
surprising words

603
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:57,923
have become a light for us.

604
01:01:23,653 --> 01:01:26,049
You know you are aloof?

605
01:01:26,467 --> 01:01:28,758
That is?

606
01:01:29,593 --> 01:01:32,509
You seem to feel
always out of place.

607
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,802
Not always.

608
01:01:36,782 --> 01:01:38,866
Now, for example, here...

609
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,492
I feel good.

610
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:50,326
You look like someone who
has lost something.

611
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,619
What have you done to your hair?

612
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:50,120
It's gray!

613
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:12,204
Can I stay?

614
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,664
Sure.

615
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:23,560
- You got cold feet.
- As always.

616
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:31,166
- You look better with gray hair.
- Really?

617
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:36,167
You look more like ...

618
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:37,418
a philosopher.

619
01:03:39,084 --> 01:03:41,168
- A poet.
- Yeah?

620
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:46,585
- Unpredictable?
- ...A little crazy.

621
01:03:46,586 --> 01:03:48,566
Dreamy...

622
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,129
Hi Giovanni, how are you?

623
01:03:56,484 --> 01:03:58,568
You instead
have nothing to tell me?

624
01:03:59,819 --> 01:04:03,256
- What do I have to tell you?
- What are you up to with Mara?

625
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,757
With Mara?

626
01:04:07,008 --> 01:04:08,571
I am not going to tell you.

627
01:04:13,155 --> 01:04:14,822
Then don't tell me.

628
01:04:35,344 --> 01:04:38,573
You should mess up your hair slightly
Bottini, you'd look better.

629
01:04:44,095 --> 01:04:45,449
De Bellis called me.

630
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:49,096
He would like to invite you for dinner
after the party's closing speech.

631
01:04:49,826 --> 01:04:53,889
- He wants to have a chat with you
- What would my brother do?

632
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:56,910
He would suspect a trap and not go.

633
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:02,016
I will go instead.

634
01:05:05,246 --> 01:05:06,600
What's the matter?

635
01:05:07,018 --> 01:05:09,309
Sooner or later your brother
will be back.

636
01:05:09,623 --> 01:05:13,060
And you would not like it, 
would you?!

637
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:14,520
No.

638
01:05:15,354 --> 01:05:16,708
I would not like it. No.

639
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,501
I want to confess something.

640
01:05:23,999 --> 01:05:26,291
Just to think about it gives me the chills.

641
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:35,042
To someone like you I would give my vote.

642
01:05:36,814 --> 01:05:39,834
And you feel guilty, why?

643
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:45,981
Don't worry,

644
01:05:47,232 --> 01:05:48,378
it happens.

645
01:05:53,898 --> 01:05:56,502
It happens when you are afraid of winning.

646
01:06:12,753 --> 01:06:15,149
Let's be more friendly, Andrea, OK?

647
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:23,692
Have you seen how many there are?

648
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:26,922
We haven't seen a crowd like that in years.

649
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:32,131
There is a word I love
in particular.

650
01:07:36,507 --> 01:07:38,799
And it's not here!

651
01:07:42,342 --> 01:07:44,217
Passion!

652
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:48,489
A key word not only for politics,
but for life as well.

653
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:59,010
Excuse me, I am talking to you.

654
01:08:01,095 --> 01:08:03,386
You say:

655
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:05,679
Our movement is in a bad shape.

656
01:08:07,347 --> 01:08:09,639
The Darkness is increasing.

657
01:08:10,473 --> 01:08:12,660
Our Powers are decreasing.

658
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:16,203
Now, after we have worked all these years,

659
01:08:16,204 --> 01:08:20,162
we are in a worse condition 
than at the beginning.

660
01:08:23,393 --> 01:08:26,622
But the enemy stands stronger 
than ever!

661
01:08:28,706 --> 01:08:31,102
Their Power seems to have increased.

662
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:34,749
They have taken on an appearance 
of invincibility.

663
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:39,750
We have made mistakes,

664
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:41,939
it is undeniable.

665
01:08:44,023 --> 01:08:46,210
Our numbers are dwindling.

666
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:50,274
Our words are in disarray.

667
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:55,275
The enemy has taken our words 
and twisted them 

668
01:08:55,276 --> 01:08:59,547
into something unrecognizable.

669
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:05,485
Now, what is wrong about what 
we have said?

670
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:07,361
Some parts or everything?

671
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:11,321
On whom do we still count? 

672
01:09:11,843 --> 01:09:15,384
Are we left over, thrown clear 
out of a living river?

673
01:09:17,156 --> 01:09:19,865
Are we going to be left behind,
Understanding no one, 

674
01:09:21,636 --> 01:09:24,241
and understood by no one?

675
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:31,325
Do we need Luck?

676
01:09:34,868 --> 01:09:37,055
So you ask!

677
01:09:39,035 --> 01:09:41,640
Expect no other answer 

678
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:46,536
except your own!

679
01:10:11,746 --> 01:10:14,350
I've never seen you eating
with so much appetite.

680
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:16,643
As a matter of fact, since I know you
I've never seen you eating.

681
01:10:16,956 --> 01:10:18,831
What's happening to you?
You talk of passion...

682
01:10:18,832 --> 01:10:22,791
This morning you almost managed
to move me!

683
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:25,500
It would have been a miracle.

684
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,480
How far do you want to go?

685
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:31,752
This country is tired, 
rotten...afraid.

686
01:10:31,753 --> 01:10:34,045
One cannot afford to be naive.

687
01:10:34,358 --> 01:10:38,213
I...could be helpful.

688
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:42,172
I do not know exactly how far
you think you can get, on your own.

689
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:48,527
To free Italians from fear.

690
01:10:49,049 --> 01:10:52,486
From fear! Interesting, yes.

691
01:10:52,488 --> 01:10:56,238
And commendable, but I know
you too well.

692
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,426
I am sure, this
unexpected exuberance,

693
01:10:58,427 --> 01:11:01,656
this speech that has become
sharp, I admit,

694
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:05,824
really effective, it is not yours.

695
01:11:05,825 --> 01:11:08,846
It is not part of your DNA.

696
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,305
Meaning?

697
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:15,931
An eminent politician once told me
about his experience

698
01:11:15,932 --> 01:11:18,224
with certain chemicals.

699
01:11:19,163 --> 01:11:21,454
He said they were a tremendous help.

700
01:11:21,455 --> 01:11:25,101
That they even solve certain
disturbances of personality!

701
01:11:25,102 --> 01:11:29,998
It seems to me that, for sure, you
are taking something strong.

702
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:34,061
Why don't you propose to our
leadership a drug test?

703
01:11:34,063 --> 01:11:35,521
I wouldn't mind!

704
01:11:35,522 --> 01:11:37,605
Good idea!

705
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:42,294
But, look, I'm being serious,
what are you hiding?

706
01:11:42,295 --> 01:11:45,107
Look, De Bellis what you do not
seem to understand

707
01:11:45,108 --> 01:11:47,713
something much bigger is happening.

708
01:11:47,818 --> 01:11:50,318
Instead people got it very well.

709
01:11:51,881 --> 01:11:55,006
Even the elephants inside the party
understood that music is changing!

710
01:11:55,007 --> 01:11:56,361
Accept it De Bellis.

711
01:11:56,363 --> 01:11:57,613
What?

712
01:11:57,614 --> 01:11:58,864
This time we will win.

713
01:12:39,177 --> 01:12:42,094
You go ahead and I'll catch up
because Bertrand asked me

714
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:44,595
to buy a box of colors.

715
01:12:46,263 --> 01:12:47,513
Yes?

716
01:12:48,659 --> 01:12:49,805
Hello?

717
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:53,973
Hello, who is this?

718
01:13:03,036 --> 01:13:04,286
Hello?

719
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,725
Hello, who is it?

720
01:13:08,872 --> 01:13:10,851
You waste my time playing?

721
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:16,165
Hello? Hello?

722
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:30,207
<i>It's me.</i>

723
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:39,292
How are you Giovanni?

724
01:13:46,272 --> 01:13:48,043
Are you well?

725
01:13:55,856 --> 01:13:58,460
I wanted to thank you.

726
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:05,961
- Your pill.
- I took it already.

727
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,317
Who was it?

728
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:10,026
You want to go out with me
somewhere? Such a beautiful day.

729
01:14:10,027 --> 01:14:11,173
Can you?

730
01:14:11,174 --> 01:14:13,466
No, but it's a long time since
I've been by the sea.

731
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:22,529
Where is Enrico?

732
01:15:23,155 --> 01:15:24,926
Enrico!
Enrico!

733
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,469
Where is he?

734
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:33,053
- He is going to come.
- Danielle, look for him.

735
01:15:34,408 --> 01:15:36,075
Calm down.

736
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:04,514
NEVER WORDS WERE CLEARER

737
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:09,202
- Hello!
- It is a surprise for Danielle.

738
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:12,745
As you can see: zero autonomy.

739
01:16:12,746 --> 01:16:15,037
- The country did you good!
- Yes, thank you.

740
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,226
I understand why Danielle
is in love with you.

741
01:16:17,956 --> 01:16:19,727
Now you're a different man!

742
01:16:21,395 --> 01:16:24,311
I want to show you something...I did
a research for my new film.

743
01:16:24,104 --> 01:16:25,667
Come.

744
01:16:32,647 --> 01:16:36,189
<i>Under what condition will you soften
your position?</i>

745
01:16:36,189 --> 01:16:38,168
<i>Personally under no condition,
no condition.</i>

746
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:42,231
<i>It is not a question of trading
one interruption or two.</i>

747
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:44,211
<i>There should be no interruptions.</i>

748
01:16:44,421 --> 01:16:46,088
<i>Is it an ethical, moral question?</i>

749
01:16:46,089 --> 01:16:49,630
<i>Yes, it's also respect for
ourselves, not only for the authors,</i>

750
01:16:49,631 --> 01:16:52,027
<i>who make a craft of storytelling,</i>

751
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:56,195
<i>who are inventors of situations,
characters, who cannot undergo</i>

752
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:59,946
<i>this continuous aggression,
this barbaric villainy.</i>

753
01:16:59,947 --> 01:17:03,072
<i>How can one respect oneself
in this continuous getting slapped,</i>

754
01:17:03,073 --> 01:17:05,156
<i>spitting in the face and insults?</i>

755
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:09,220
You see, Fellini is the artist who
more than anyone else has fought

756
01:17:09,221 --> 01:17:12,138
so that indecency would 
not become a habit.

757
01:17:13,493 --> 01:17:16,618
When TV channels
went to spy on his death,

758
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:20,056
Their real mission was to
announce the end of a world

759
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:22,245
and the birth of a new cycle.

760
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:23,808
Politics...

761
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:26,205
as permanent invention 
of reality,

762
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:28,394
as an imposture.

763
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,145
You surprised me, Enrico.

764
01:17:33,292 --> 01:17:36,729
You are testimony of a failure
involving everyone.

765
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:41,522
Could you please chop the onion?

766
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,877
Yes, sure.

767
01:17:42,878 --> 01:17:45,170
I'm making curry pilaf rice.

768
01:17:46,733 --> 01:17:48,296
It's Danielle's favorite dish.

769
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:49,755
Is your movie telling a story?

770
01:17:49,756 --> 01:17:53,090
I do not like films of which
you can tell the story.

771
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:56,841
Hi, my love.

772
01:17:56,842 --> 01:17:58,508
How are you?

773
01:18:32,884 --> 01:18:37,259
I found it in the closet,
hidden. Who is she?

774
01:18:41,844 --> 01:18:43,094
She was our fianc√©e.

775
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:55,803
I did not think I would be again
in the middle of your games.

776
01:18:57,575 --> 01:18:59,033
You shouldn't have done it.

777
01:18:59,659 --> 01:19:03,097
It's not my fault, people from the
the party in Rome did everything.

778
01:19:03,098 --> 01:19:04,765
But you allowed it.

779
01:19:06,328 --> 01:19:09,349
Perhaps it was wrong of me to help.

780
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,017
You saved me.

781
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,934
You told me that you don't
see your brother anymore.

782
01:19:13,935 --> 01:19:16,227
It's true,
I have not seen him for 25 years.

783
01:19:17,374 --> 01:19:20,499
- You? 
- Me neither, haven't seen him since

784
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,583
- Since when? Cannes?
- Yes!

785
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:29,251
The book you found at home,

786
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:32,169
it's the only thing I received
in all these years.

787
01:19:33,107 --> 01:19:36,441
Helene showed me the photo
you keep where you are with him.

788
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:42,379
She thought it was me that
man in the photograph

789
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,630
So?

790
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:48,006
You have never forgotten him.

791
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:51,653
No

792
01:19:53,842 --> 01:19:55,925
I never forget anybody.

793
01:19:56,134 --> 01:19:59,364
I always keep with me
all the men I loved in my life.

794
01:19:59,885 --> 01:20:01,969
You too I haven't forgotten.

795
01:20:02,282 --> 01:20:05,095
Otherwise you would not be here
with me now.

796
01:20:11,658 --> 01:20:13,637
I loved both of you.

797
01:20:15,826 --> 01:20:17,284
I don't believe you.

798
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:21,869
But it is true.

799
01:20:24,474 --> 01:20:27,703
I loved your right eye...

800
01:20:29,267 --> 01:20:31,454
and his left eye.

801
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:31,351
Giovanni!

802
01:21:31,873 --> 01:21:33,852
Giovanni!
Giovanni!

803
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,207
Giovanni, are you here?

804
01:21:56,146 --> 01:21:57,396
Giovanni!

805
01:22:16,876 --> 01:22:20,001
- Andrea!
<i>- Anna what's up?</i>

806
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:25,315
<i>- Anna, what's happening?</i>
- He disappeared!

807
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:27,920
Again!

808
01:23:52,296 --> 01:23:56,046
- Hello?
<i>- Andrea? Are you asleep?</i>

809
01:23:56,047 --> 01:23:57,089
No

810
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:59,485
<i>Where have you disappeared?</i>

811
01:23:59,486 --> 01:24:01,570
<i>Have you seen the surveys?</i>

812
01:24:01,571 --> 01:24:02,613
No

813
01:24:02,614 --> 01:24:05,009
<i>Enrico, literally he's
taking him to bits.</i>

814
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:08,552
I want to see the faces of
TV news directors tomorrow,

815
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:12,095
<i>But where is he?
The president is looking for him.</i>

816
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:15,221
<i>- Andrea?</i> 
- Yes, here I am.

817
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:18,243
What's the problem?
You have a strange voice.

818
01:24:18,244 --> 01:24:20,431
No, no, nothing.
I have no problem.

819
01:24:20,536 --> 01:24:23,453
He's already in bed.
In short...you know him.

820
01:24:23,454 --> 01:24:25,642
I'll tell him tomorrow. OK?

821
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:29,184
Anyhow, thanks for the good
news, I'm happy, thanks.

822
01:24:29,185 --> 01:24:31,477
- Bye, good night
<i>- Ciao.</i>

823
01:24:45,228 --> 01:24:47,728
Forgive me, I'm dead tired.

824
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:51,688
Tomorrow I have to be on the set at 6,
I go to sleep.
