1
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,035
What idiot fired that?

2
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,457
Nate.

3
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,585
MacMasters.

4
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,187
I've been looking for you, Nate.

5
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,050
Passed through Butte.

6
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,054
Felt sure you'd be in the saloon.

7
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,098
I kinda figured that.

8
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,227
I was gonna buy you a drink.

9
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,313
I'm sorry I missed that.

10
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,649
That's why I brought it with me.

11
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,660
Top shelf.

12
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,866
What's the matter, Nate?
Don't you like top shelf?

13
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,754
Thought you were down near Medicine Bow.

14
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,130
Heard you were, too.

15
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,758
I was, month back.

16
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,884
It's what I heard.

17
00:02:55,885 --> 00:03:00,890
How about we go down to the saloon,
I'll buy you that drink?

18
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,894
Nate Mason, I'm arresting you
on three counts of murder.

19
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:09,148
Bank president and bank guard in Casper,

20
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,108
Deputy Bill Clark in Laramie.

21
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:14,028
I'm also arresting you
for the robbery of those banks.

22
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,658
Damn, Marshal.
I've done a hell of a lot more than that.

23
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,510
Those are the ones I've got paper on.

24
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,145
Don't do it.

25
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,492
Jesse, your long run is over.
Now reach for the sky.

26
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:47,037
Turn around slowly,
and don't make any sudden moves.

27
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,087
Jesse James, I'm arresting you,
all charges against you.

28
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:58,007
Most recently,
a stagecoach at Hot Springs.

29
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,633
But now it's over.

30
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,653
You made the mistake
of coming to Clearmont

31
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,097
and crossin' paths
with the great Britt MacMasters.

32
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,559
Criminy, Albert.
I told you, use your name, not my pa's.

33
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,871
- But your pa is famous.
- Not to me, he ain't.

34
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,248
And I can't look at you the same
with you saying you're him.

35
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,567
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means what I'm saying!

36
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,256
You never wanna be the marshal,

37
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,133
and now it sounds like you
don't wanna be the outlaw either.

38
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,701
- It means what I'm saying.
- It is, Chad.

39
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,263
If you wanna be the marshal,
then be the marshal. I don't care.

40
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,474
I told you I don't wanna be
Marshal MacMasters!

41
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,225
Why in the hell would I wanna be him?

42
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,300
You could be Marshal Hansen or somethin'.

43
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,465
Hey, boys, get in here!

44
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,301
- Food's gettin' cold!
- Yes, Grandpa.

45
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,012
Looks like you escaped
to fight another day, Jesse.

46
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,475
Come on, hurry up.

47
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,190
You go any slower,
you're gonna have to eat with the pigs!

48
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,237
Well, so the only way
we could get anywhere near that cabin

49
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,656
was to climb Lookout Mountain.

50
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,534
Don't forget now,
that's a 4,000-foot fall.

51
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,119
I blew in through that door,

52
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:15,084
and your daddy, he's got a rifle through
the window and we got him dead to rights.

53
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,086
Did they surrender?

54
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,422
Well, when they found out
it was the MacMasters brothers,

55
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,383
they just gave up their ghosts!

56
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,277
Wait, wait. Pa told me
when he kicked in the door,

57
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,197
one of the gang shot him, so he blasted
three of them to kingdom come.

58
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,306
Well, that may have been another cabin.

59
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,184
We were hittin' a lot of cabins
in those days.

60
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,563
Be right back, the privy calls.

61
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,989
His pa is over in Sheridan,
trying to get a bank loan.

62
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,782
He'll be back in a couple of days.

63
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,412
And your pa, he's out there
doing what he does for a living.

64
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,058
If he had a choice,
he'd be home here with you.

65
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,501
I ain't seen him
in nearly three months, Grandpa.

66
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,879
Well, now that don't mean
he don't like you.

67
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,716
He loves you, boy.
That's why he's out there.

68
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,549
Sure has a funny way of showing it.

69
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,262
Well, you listen to what you just said.

70
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,640
Show me a little gratitude.

71
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:13,851
Gratitude? For leaving me alone?

72
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,495
He's out there providin'. He's...

73
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,605
Six riders coming, over the ridge.

74
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,295
Who are they?

75
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,593
No good by the looks of 'em.

76
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,930
Hold up there!

77
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,146
Evenin'.

78
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,147
Yep.

79
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,902
Me and my boys been ridin' all day.

80
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,820
We are mighty thirsty.

81
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,158
You got a lot of water
right in front of yal!

82
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,371
Looks a bit dirty.

83
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:21,001
You mind putting that rifle down, mister?

84
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,337
Them things is dangerous, don't you know?

85
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,675
We don't want no dead geezer
on the front porch, do we?

86
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,513
What you looking for?

87
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,307
I'm looking for someone.

88
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,809
Who's askin'?

89
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,478
An old friend.

90
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
Ain't this the ranch
of Marshal Britt MacMasters?

91
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,318
I'd like to see him.

92
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,905
Well, he's not us, he ain't here.

93
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,576
You wouldn't mind if me and my friends
here had a look inside, would you?

94
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,413
You're not coming in this house.

95
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,873
Jack.

96
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,968
Grandpa!

97
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,386
Grandpa, wake up!

98
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,597
Hyah, get up there.

99
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,808
I'm all right.

100
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,070
MacMasters!

101
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,405
Grandpa!

102
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,034
Marshal MacMasters!

103
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,996
Search the house!

104
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,957
Silas, middle. Willie.

105
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,168
Blade.

106
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,130
My pa ain't here, and if he was,
you'd be dead by now!

107
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,674
MacMasters is your daddy, boy?

108
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,136
Ain't that a kick of the mule?

109
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,806
- He ain't here.
- Ain't that the luck.

110
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,184
We'll make MacMasters come to us.

111
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,898
- Where's your pa, boy?
- I don't know.

112
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,524
How long he been gone?

113
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,985
Too long.

114
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,739
Albert, run!

115
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,284
Albert! You stay put.

116
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,373
You a MacMasters, too?

117
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,792
No, sir.

118
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,169
Good.

119
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,886
He's dying, kid. You're coming with us.

120
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,749
- York.
- Marshal.

121
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,169
I heard you coming a mile away.

122
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,089
And smelled you coming two miles away.

123
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,970
Nate Mason and the Giles brothers.

124
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,390
Nate? Judge ordered 'im alive.

125
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,393
Well, Nate didn't know that.

126
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,896
I have something for you.

127
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,741
Here you go, Marshal. You deserve it.

128
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,661
You get 'em all at once?

129
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,624
Yep. I need you to bury "em for me."

130
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:54,798
I can do that... for a price.
Everything for a price.

131
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,467
I'll take their guns...

132
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,470
and the horses.

133
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,056
Don't matter to me.

134
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,685
Wire the sheriff.

135
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,104
He'll get word to the judge.

136
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:14,484
Marshal, that hangman's kid's gonna starve
if you don't get out of this business.

137
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,468
Hey, Jed, we been ridin' for a while.

138
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,098
Come on! We'll make it to the hills
before dark.

139
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,355
Do we have a direction
of where we're going from here, Jed?

140
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,233
Heading south, into Sioux territory.

141
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,904
South? I like that. Mexico.

142
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,133
Them hills are close enough,

143
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,201
holdin' up here ten minutes won't hurt.

144
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:09,915
Get back.

145
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,044
Thought you'd be tougher.

146
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,880
I never walked this far before.

147
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,884
You wouldn't be walking at all if your pa
had been back home looking after you.

148
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,696
Instead, he left you
with some old coot to get kidnapped.

149
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,141
Things went as they was planned,
your pa would be dead, you'd be an orphan.

150
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,812
Let's hurry up with that plan.

151
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,981
Get up.

152
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,155
We'll catch up with Blade over yonder.

153
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,868
- Britt.
- What's goin' on?

154
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:29,911
It's your pa.

155
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,671
Pa.

156
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,551
Hey, Britt.

157
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,803
You don't look too good, Pa.

158
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:51,016
Oh... nothin' a little whiskey don't fix.

159
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,687
- What happened?
- Oh, uh...

160
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:59,149
There were five or six of 'em
and I-I tried to...

161
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:03,236
I-I just passed out.

162
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,280
Chad?

163
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,658
Chad!

164
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,954
Chad?

165
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,248
It's not Chad, Britt.

166
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,794
It's Albert Hansen, Jack's boy.

167
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,463
Where's Chad?

168
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,925
We don't know.
I rode out here this mornin',

169
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,737
"cause Dex was supposed to pick up
an order from the mercantile yesterday,

170
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,679
but he never showed up.

171
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,515
Starr asked me to check up on him,

172
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,809
found him unconscious
along the signal road.

173
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:38,772
I tried to saddle up,
and I just tried to get into town...

174
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,692
How long ago did it happen?

175
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,403
Three days ago.

176
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,072
We looked everywhere for Chad.

177
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,909
I got a whole search party
out looking from him now. We'll find him.

178
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,678
Well, if he escaped
from whatever happened here,

179
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,153
he would've come back by now.

180
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,333
I telegraphed to Sheridan
to see if they had any activity.

181
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,672
- Jed Blake.
- Yeah.

182
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:08,051
Robbed a stage on the Laramie trail,
and the bank in Casper. You know him?

183
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,720
I put him away five years ago.

184
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,762
- Yep.
- He's got five more ahead of him.

185
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,144
Escaped last month with his man.

186
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,480
Cass Gibbs.

187
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,358
Cass Gibbs, that son of a bitch.

188
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,153
Robbed a bank in Arvada Wednesday.

189
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,656
That's the same day Chad was taken.

190
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,717
Must've joined up
with the rest of his boys.

191
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,743
Looks like Jed's my pigeon.

192
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,666
Pa, listen to me.

193
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,587
I'm gonna go find Chad, okay?

194
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,547
- Yeah.
- All right.

195
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,216
You take care of yourself. I'll be back.

196
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,073
Nothin' on him says who he is
or where he's from.

197
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,284
Looks like there were a lot of 'em.

198
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,792
I think someone came here looking for me.

199
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,337
Why shoot Dex and kill Albert?

200
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,881
'Cause I wasn't here.

201
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,557
Tsk.

202
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,308
I have to bury that boy's body
before it starts turnin'.

203
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,649
I'd appreciate it
if you'd notify Albert's daddy.

204
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,735
Yeah, I will.

205
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,070
When are you headed out?

206
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,572
They got a hefty head start.

207
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:56,451
- Better get goin' right away.
- Well, I'll get a posse together.

208
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,871
No. Too much time.

209
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,707
And they'll just get in the way.

210
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,459
You sure about that?

211
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,836
Gonna take on Jed Blake's gang alone?

212
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,007
- I did it before.
- I'll come with you.

213
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,009
I need you to stay here.

214
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,343
Watch out for my pa,
in case they circle back.

215
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,682
Then take Clay with you.

216
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,518
No time for greenhorns.

217
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,896
He's green, but he can shoot.
I taught him.

218
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,649
And Britt...

219
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,345
Starr sent these along
for your boy when you find him.

220
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,535
It's his favorite penny candy
from the mercantile.

221
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,788
What's his favorite?

222
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,666
The whole town knows.

223
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,545
He heads out to that mercantile, whoo!
Look out, peppermint sticks!

224
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,978
Good luck!

225
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,548
Ain't we got enough to deal with,
the marshal on our ass?

226
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,717
Why, you gettin' jittery, Silas?

227
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:40,055
You see them mountains over there?
Crawlin' with Sioux.

228
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,892
Them mountains are more than
50 miles away and we're ridin' past 'em.

229
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:49,147
Once we kill the marshal,
we can go to Mexico.

230
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,232
You hate Mexico.

231
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,109
Damn right, I do.

232
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,862
Why don't we just head straight south?
It'd be faster.

233
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,946
Where is your sense
of adventure, Willie?

234
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,078
We's easy targets out here,
a blind man could track us.

235
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,331
Jed, you better let that kid
ride tomorrow.

236
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,018
If Indians come down on us,
we're gonna have to ride fast.

237
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,505
Well, if he can't keep up, drag him.

238
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,507
He's a kid, Jed.

239
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,611
Damn, even I got a little compassion.

240
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:22,305
That's why you're following, Silas.
Not leading.

241
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,227
I'll be back.

242
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,694
Hey.

243
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,239
You know I'm always watchin' you, right?

244
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,659
Good.

245
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,917
What's gotten into him?

246
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,504
He's always been a mean prick,
but not like this.

247
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,007
Them five years in prison
were hard on him,

248
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,302
and all he thinks about
is going after MacMasters.

249
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:05,432
He ain't no prairie rose,
but he damn sure has changed.

250
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,058
Damn right.

251
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,563
Watch yourself.

252
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,197
Hey. Here, eat this.
We leave before sunrise.

253
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,825
- I ain't makin' breakfast.
- I ain't hungry.

254
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,609
Yeah, but you'll damn well be tomorrow
and you know it.

255
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,206
Why...

256
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,460
Why did he have to kill Albert?

257
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,130
He didn't even have a gun.

258
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,941
Kill all the witnesses, I suppose.

259
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:43,052
He was just
standing there and he shot him.

260
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,345
Yeah.

261
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,808
He wasn't shot dead,
he shot him some more.

262
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,393
You need to quit thinkin' about it, kid.

263
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,065
He's gonna kill me, too. Ain't he?

264
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,485
Nah, he wants your pa.

265
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:02,030
My pa most likely
don't even know you took me.

266
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,659
Once he finds out, ain't nothin'
on his mind but coming for you.

267
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,830
In a month or two.
Sometimes, he's gone as long as three.

268
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,832
I bet...

269
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:17,378
I bet you got Sheriff Wilkins and a posse
from Clearmont tracking you down.

270
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,506
Jed wouldn't like that.

271
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,675
Makes two of us.

272
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,260
Get up, Willie.

273
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,304
Stop talking to that boy.

274
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,681
Take care, kid.

275
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,028
Hey, Jed, talkin'
to that MacMasters kid...

276
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,780
Yeah?

277
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,282
He says the sheriff from that town

278
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,410
is gettin' up a posse and comin' after us,
not the marshal.

279
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,038
- Not MacMasters.
- No.

280
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,457
It'll be MacMasters.

281
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,254
I was just sayin', the marshal
could be another month or so

282
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,714
before he gets back to the ranch.

283
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,634
What if he got back the same day
we took the kid, Willie?

284
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,596
He could be here tonight.

285
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,266
We ain't got a lookout.

286
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,978
That's right, we don't.

287
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,961
That's why I just elected you, Willie.

288
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,691
Silas will spell you in two hours.

289
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,944
- Blade, saddle up.
- What?

290
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,362
Saddle up.

291
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,116
Want you to backtrack,

292
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,411
find a spot
from here to them hills, look out.

293
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:35,832
Once you find MacMasters and his posse,
get your ass back here.

294
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,751
Right. I know what to do.

295
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,253
And Blade...

296
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,340
You leave MacMasters alone.

297
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,342
Do you hear me?

298
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,636
I heard you.

299
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,318
Better get some sleep.

300
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,586
- Hey, kid, wake up!
- I'm awake!

301
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,839
Marshal, we've been ridin' all night.
Can't we camp?

302
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,193
Last thing I need is for you
to fall off your horse and slow us down.

303
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,053
I said, I'm awake!

304
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,348
- Half asleep ain't full awake.
- You're a real mean son of a...

305
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,932
Damn!

306
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,518
Damn, Marshal!
What'd you do that for?

307
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,605
Peace of mind.
Now I know you'll stay awake.

308
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,486
Son of a bitch!
I got a loose tooth, dammit!

309
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,232
You can tell they're running fast.

310
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,651
Prints are deep.

311
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,487
Yep, I see.

312
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,951
If they hit up the bank,
then this way makes sense.

313
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,884
- Avoid a posse from the Laramie trail.
- Yeah, it's just what I was thinkin'.

314
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,792
You done much tracking, Tucker?

315
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,378
Not much of it called for in town.

316
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,381
Suspected as much.

317
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,219
These tracks are from a war party.

318
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,597
- What?
- Hooves are unshod.

319
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,701
Jed Blake's gang turned south a mile back.

320
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,160
Well, why don't we follow 'em?

321
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,811
I need to pick up my guide.

322
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,857
- A guide? What for?
- If the trail goes cold.

323
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,241
Hell, if a trail go cold,
no one can follow it.

324
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,611
Chaska can.

325
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,406
Chaska? An Injun?

326
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,075
Half Injun, half white.

327
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,245
- How can we trust him?
- He's a good man.

328
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,464
I didn't figure you for much
of an Injun-lover, Marshal MacMasters.

329
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:28,004
Well, I might even learn
to like you one day.

330
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,882
I'm full of surprises.

331
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,555
MacMasters, I'm not ridin'
with no half-breed!

332
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,807
Then turn your horse and head for home.

333
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:43,352
I need Chaska on this hunt
a hell of a lot more than I need you.

334
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,258
Come here, boy.
Give me that hat.

335
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,928
Hey, give it back.

336
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,514
It's hotter than blazes out here.
Give me my hat!

337
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,450
Let the sun burn in your scalp, boy.

338
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,813
It'll take the fight out of ya.

339
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,646
Tucker, check on her.

340
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,199
Is that the blacksmith?

341
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,744
Damn.

342
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,379
Yeah, it's Harry Dwyer.

343
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,381
This his wife, too?

344
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,971
Yeah, that's his wife.

345
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,186
- Where you goin'?
- We gotta ride.

346
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,707
That war party might pick up
Jed's trail by cutting east.

347
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,108
Aren't we gonna bury 'em?

348
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,860
It'll take 15 minutes.

349
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,278
You got a shovel?

350
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,322
No.

351
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,658
Neither do I.
So it'll take more than 15 minutes.

352
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,452
We ain't got the time.

353
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:14,879
Let's go.

354
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:16,923
Hyah!

355
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,192
Come on, boy.

356
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:45,993
- Hey, Willie.
- What?

357
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:50,247
We robbed the stage and the bank days ago
and we ain't divide the loot up yet.

358
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,624
True.

359
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,002
We always divide it up as soon as we can.

360
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,381
Jed'll do it.

361
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,426
Willie, when? I don't wanna die broke.

362
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,886
Who says you're gonna die?

363
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,890
We're out here, ridin' in the open
in Indian territory,

364
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:11,936
with a marshal behind us
that takes us dead, not alive!

365
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,690
- We're sittin' ducks.
- What's your point?

366
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,317
We're gonna die.
Sooner than later.

367
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,320
You don't need that money, do you?

368
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,995
Willie! Silas!
Don't be makin' any plans now!

369
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,515
Hello!

370
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:52,977
Chaska!

371
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,986
Hello, Chaska.

372
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,904
He's not here.

373
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,035
Hold it right there.

374
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,913
State your business.

375
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,207
Chaska.

376
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,541
If you've lost your eyesight,
you ain't worth a plug-nickel to me.

377
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,130
Britt MacMasters?

378
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,349
Hello, brother.

379
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,229
Hell no, I haven't lost my eyesight.

380
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,125
You should come ridin' in with the sun
at your back, like you always do.

381
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:43,277
You know it. What brings you in?

382
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,946
Got a tracking job for you.

383
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,698
<i>I'm listenin'.</i>

384
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:50,159
Could be Jed Blake and his gang.

385
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,828
You don't need me to catch those pissants.

386
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,762
I do, if they go above the tree line.

387
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:56,665
Mountains?

388
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,043
Uh, I said, "if."

389
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:02,546
Tracks head south, maybe Mexico,
but I can't take a chance. I-

390
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,006
I need you.

391
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:08,636
You know the deal.
Ten dollars for the week.

392
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,263
Anything more, I get a dollar a day extra.

393
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,640
Fair enough.

394
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,850
Ten dollars?

395
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,686
That's right, kid.

396
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,189
You see those hills over there?

397
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,941
That's Sioux territory.

398
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:26,612
Whether we go desert or high country,
my scalp is worth at least $10.

399
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,865
What'd they do, Britt?

400
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:34,954
Shot Dex, killed a boy,
and they kidnapped my son.

401
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,211
I'll find them.

402
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,965
You kill them, you owe me nothin'.

403
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:49,385
Who's the greenhorn?

404
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,555
He's Clay Tucker,
deputy out of Clearmont.

405
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,124
You know,
he don't talk much like an Injun.

406
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,407
Father was Ki wa-go, great warrior.

407
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,703
His mom was Kate Ryan, missionary.
Gave him a good schoolin'.

408
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,337
- Where we headed, Britt?
- Follow me.

409
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,398
What do you got?

410
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:29,526
I see hills ahead,
lots of rocks for cover.

411
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,986
How far?

412
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,905
Half a day.

413
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,366
It's a good place for an ambush.

414
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,036
Circle far around.

415
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,570
If they left anyone there,
you come in behind 'em.

416
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:43,823
We'll ride in the front door.

417
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,085
Got it.

418
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:14,822
Whoa.

419
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,038
Whoa, son.

420
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,678
Yeah, that's right, keep comin'.

421
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,891
Another half a mile,
and I got you dead to rights.

422
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,477
Only on one of your good days.

423
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,694
Let's go. Hyah! Hyah!

424
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,470
I'm bleedin' out.
Give me something to stop this bleeding.

425
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,499
You give me some answers, now.

426
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,812
I was just restin'. I'm heading to Oregon.

427
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,962
<i>You're Win'.</i>

428
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,672
I'm not, it's the truth.

429
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:16,300
"I got you dead to rights."

430
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,510
Hardly the words of a guy restin'.

431
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,347
Now get that arm up.

432
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,849
Real nice and easy, give me your iron.

433
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,602
Slow.

434
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,901
- Who are you?
- I'm just a lookout.

435
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,277
A lookout for who?

436
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,780
Indians. We're in Sioux territory.

437
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,783
That sounds like a lot
of trail dust to me.

438
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,911
How about sneakin' some truth
into those words of yours?

439
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,165
I ain't got a lot of patience, mister.

440
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,056
Now...

441
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,685
How about you sing me a nice little song
about everything you know?

442
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,354
I don't think so.

443
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,064
Marshal, I don't sing.

444
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,565
Really?

445
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,532
Where's Jed Blake?

446
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,993
He cut dirt yesterday.
Headin' southwest.

447
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,080
- My son?
- He's fine last time I seen him.

448
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,708
- How many ridin' with him??
- Four. Maybe five.

449
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,045
Why southwest? Mexico's south.

450
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,213
I don't know.

451
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,757
Sioux territory.

452
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,236
Now why the hell would he do that?

453
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,681
Jed's gone loco. Crazy.
All he talks about is huntin' you down.

454
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,308
What do they call you?

455
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,311
Blade.

456
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,023
Bound to be paper
on a mean-lookin' nibbler like you.

457
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,694
Tucker, toss down some rope.

458
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,866
Chaska, tie his hands
and drag his ass up the hill.

459
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,200
Get up.

460
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,594
You didn't search him?

461
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,474
No. I didn't think
you'd want to drag him along.

462
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,476
You were right.

463
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,311
Your back was toward him.

464
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,647
How'd you know he was gonna draw?

465
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,508
A little glint in his eye
said he knew better than me.

466
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,970
Lots of hoof print, shod.

467
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,764
These are our boys.

468
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,682
Yep, day ahead.

469
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,833
Do you know this place?

470
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:15,312
Crosses into Sioux territory.

471
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,314
I thought he was headed for Mexico.

472
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,942
I guess he fooled us.

473
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,528
What about the Injuns?

474
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,614
Jed likes to play rough.

475
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,909
Sioux on one side, us on the other.

476
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:32,162
That's comfortin', considerin' we still
got warriors behind us.

477
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,557
Let's get through this as fast as we can.

478
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,726
We'll find a place
to fight on the other side.

479
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,669
How long is it gonna take to cross?

480
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,337
Four hours.

481
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,339
Hyah!

482
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,485
I'll ride ahead
and meet you under the cover of night.

483
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:46,927
Okay, we'll see you tonight.

484
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,309
It is awful dry.

485
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,562
There ain't no water anywhere.

486
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,689
We'll get water just beyond them buttes.

487
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,942
Hey, Jed, I gotta ask you.

488
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,695
Why did we come this way?

489
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,405
Cat and mouse, Silas.

490
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,532
Little bit of torture first.

491
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,916
"What's the difference between
killin" him now or killin' him later?

492
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,931
You need to be nice to that kid,
you need him alive.

493
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,582
You're right.

494
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,893
I want MacMasters
to hate me as much as he can.

495
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,128
You need his pa.

496
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,714
I do need his pa. To kill him.

497
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,968
Hyah!

498
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,764
- Hyah!
- Go get him!

499
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,173
Injun smoke signals,
and you wanna have a campfire?

500
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,842
It gets cold at night.

501
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,849
You really trust
that Injun friend on yours?

502
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,769
With my life.

503
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,148
I couldn't. I just couldn't.

504
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,985
You ever hear
of the Massacre Canyon battle?

505
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,921
Didn't pay any mind to it. Just a bunch
of Injuns that killed each other.

506
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:19,204
Pawnee were on their summer buffalo hunt.

507
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,457
Sioux war party of 1,500 attacked them.

508
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:28,171
Killed over 150,
mostly women and children...

509
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,092
including Chaska's wife and son.

510
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:38,078
You can bet the bank he hates 'em
a hell of a lot more than you ever will.

511
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:02,289
- Anything?
- Yeah, I saw fire over there.

512
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,879
- MacMasters?
- No, Injuns.

513
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,047
I heard a war whoop or two.

514
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,259
They could pick up our trail.

515
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,595
Come on.

516
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,746
We need to get outta here, Cass.

517
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,624
You can't get outta here
any too soon for me.

518
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,627
What y'all gawking at?

519
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,129
Hey! Look at me.

520
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:52,923
Why do you look guilty?

521
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,800
Got a little explainin' to do.

522
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,888
Dammit! No!

523
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,681
Dammit, boys!

524
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,725
Y'all had one job, one job!

525
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:08,104
Jed, if you shoot that pistol,
the Indians are gonna be all over us.

526
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,564
Who let him go, huh?

527
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,584
- Was it you, Silas? Huh?
- It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

528
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,276
How about you, Willie?

529
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,046
- Hey, Jed, Jed.
- You liked that boy, huh?

530
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,238
You liked that boy!

531
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,865
Jed, I searched him,
and he didn't have a knife.

532
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:20,134
Oh, he didn't have a knife!

533
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,118
Then what the hell is that, Cass?

534
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,663
Whatever. He can't be too far.

535
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,122
Dammit, boys!

536
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,291
Get on your horses! Let's go find him!

537
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,336
And if we don't,
I'm killin' every one of you!

538
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,172
Told you he was gonna be pissed.

539
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:43,473
Giddy up, boy.
Let's go! Let's go!

540
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,096
I'm gonna find you, boy!

541
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,307
I'm gonna find you, and when I do...

542
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:11,811
I'm gonna shoot your pa and then you!

543
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,065
Where are you, boy?

544
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:18,610
I'm gonna find you!
I'm gonna get you!

545
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,155
Where are you, boy?

546
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,116
I'm gonna find you!

547
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:36,503
I'm gonna find you, MacMasters!

548
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:39,089
I'm gonna kill you and your pa!

549
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,383
You can't run from me!

550
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,634
I'll get you!

551
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:44,636
I'll get you!

552
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,347
I'll get you!

553
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,571
You yell out for help,

554
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:07,105
and them Indians will have our scalps
before you can close your mouth.

555
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,746
Get up, get up.

556
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,086
Okay, go! Go! Go!

557
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,212
Come on, go!

558
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:22,132
Go! Get up!

559
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,696
- Smoke signals.
- Should I ride ahead?

560
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:46,948
Why, so you can join 'em?

561
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:48,950
And why would I do that?

562
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,535
You're one of 'em, aren't you?

563
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,247
I'm not Sioux, I'm Pawnee.

564
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,042
You're all the same.

565
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,919
And you're white, so is MacMasters.

566
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,838
He's of sound judgement and smart.

567
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,673
You're a fool.

568
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:05,800
Same race, both different.

569
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:07,302
Now you listen to me!

570
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,739
I could kill you off that horse
right now if I wanted to.

571
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,615
You'd be dead before you hit the ground.

572
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,744
Well, you'd have to hit him in the heart
or between the eyes to do that.

573
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,394
I could do it.

574
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,024
You're that fast?

575
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,692
Oh, yeah.

576
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:26,279
- Well, prove it.
- Hey!

577
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,990
No! What the hell?

578
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,725
Walk, boy.

579
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:57,477
Get up there, boy.

580
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:06,945
I don't think I can.

581
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,198
I sure as hell can't carry ya.

582
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,792
Get up, boy! Stop acting like a girl!

583
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,475
Is Marshal MacMasters really your daddy?

584
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,272
He know he raisin' a son
that cries like a little girl?

585
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,708
Well, you cried a little girl
when you got your eye poked out!

586
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,153
I'm gonna shoot your eye out right now,
boy. Get up that mountain.

587
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,750
Come on, Chad!

588
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,131
Don't look so tired, boy. You tired?

589
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:13,011
I got the son of Marshal MacMasters,
and he can't climb a damn hill!

590
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:19,142
I gotta do everything my damn self.

591
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:26,607
Stop!

592
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,527
Stop, kid! Stop!

593
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,155
Don't run away from me!

594
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:41,664
Yeah.

595
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:57,513
Keep walking, boy.

596
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:03,853
Whoa, boy.

597
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:13,863
Jed. Jed.

598
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,466
You fire that gun, you're gonna have Sioux

599
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,259
from all around these hills
comin' down on us.

600
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,993
I don't give a damn.

601
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:22,038
Hey, look, Jed,
you've been beatin' on him enough.

602
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,666
You need him alive.

603
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:26,960
You better not die, boy.

604
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:30,129
I wanna see you suffer some more,
you little MacMasters brat.

605
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:35,343
Why, I ain't even began to dig
my claws in you yet, little mouse.

606
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:39,514
You're the only MacMasters
I got just now.

607
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,683
We're gonna play a game some more.

608
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:44,519
Then I'm gonna crush the breath
out of your throat.

609
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,231
Willie...

610
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,191
This your apple peeler, Willie?

611
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:51,776
- Yeah.
- You lost it.

612
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:55,071
- Hey, you found it!
- Ain't that a damn shame.

613
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,325
God, Jed!

614
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,035
What'd you do that for?

615
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,538
Make sure you don't lose it again.

616
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,331
Lucky I don't slit your throat.

617
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:06,541
Come on, kid.

618
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:10,503
Now you boys keep a look out for Cass.

619
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:14,048
Cass ain't coming back,
he left last night.

620
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,032
He must be the smartest one of us all.

621
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,514
Stop here, boy.

622
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,226
We're gonna stop for water.

623
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,276
Can I... have some water?

624
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,361
Easy now, back up.

625
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:40,867
Back up! Back up!

626
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,758
Don't drown yourself.

627
00:52:57,759 --> 00:52:59,719
You know, you tough as nails, boy.

628
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,055
Remind me of myself when I was your age.

629
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:04,640
You a good shot?

630
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,769
My pa says I am.

631
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,489
But he said, "Don't aim at anything
you're not willin' to destroy."

632
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:14,984
That's a good rule.

633
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,468
He's done a heapin'
of destroyin' over the years.

634
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,197
Yeah.

635
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,407
You'll soon find that out.

636
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:23,868
Give me that.

637
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,537
Let's go, boys!

638
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,361
Now, Willie,
what the hell are you doin'?

639
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,798
- Tryin' to get a drink.
- This is Indian country.

640
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,522
- Get on your horse, Willie.
- Gonna be a minute.

641
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,916
- Fuckin' Indians!
- Willie! Willie!

642
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,335
To the rocks!

643
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,173
Willie! Willie!

644
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,970
Cover that boy!

645
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,976
Silas! I'm gonna get the boy!

646
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,562
Willie.

647
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,564
Come on!

648
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,774
Come on, come on, come on! Let's go!

649
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,235
He's dead.

650
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,611
Dammit!

651
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:43,114
Get on your horse, Silas!
Let's go, boy.

652
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,450
Come on, boy.

653
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,086
- Tucker, find us some cover.
- Camp, already?

654
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,796
We're about to have company.

655
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,884
In those hills behind us.

656
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,774
Put your gun down, Tucker.

657
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,445
If I were a Sioux warrior,
you'd already be dead.

658
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:50,551
If I can't hear them,
how will you and Chaska?

659
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,451
That's a very good question.

660
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:54,745
Well, how about giving me
a very good answer?

661
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:57,123
When I think of one, I'll let you know.

662
00:56:57,206 --> 00:57:00,585
Until then, just sit there
and look invitin'.

663
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,547
Like a worm on a hook.

664
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,829
You sure this is the way they'll come?

665
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,809
Unless they circle wide
and come in behind us.

666
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:22,315
I know we haven't spoke of it,
but we should.

667
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,029
- You do understand that...
- Chad might be dead.

668
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,239
Yeah.

669
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,536
He doesn't know why we moved
to Clearmont, I never told him.

670
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:38,205
You have to, one day.

671
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,042
I plan on it.

672
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:47,298
When he's older,
he'll understand it better, but not now.

673
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:51,886
Chad is left at home without his mother.

674
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:56,140
He sees her rocking chair, her stove.

675
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,309
Constant reminders.

676
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,147
You stay away,
so you don't have to face those reminders.

677
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,068
It's easier for you when you're away.

678
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,404
Easy?

679
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:15,618
Chad is 12. And he's left alone
with sad memories.

680
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,706
I've known you long enough, Britt.

681
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:24,418
This is why I'm speaking.

682
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,543
What the hell?!
Why'd you take so long to shoot?

683
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,796
- Was shooting as fast as I could.
- Damn!

684
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,607
The one that came flyin' through the air?

685
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,050
If you didn't shoot him, I'd be dead.

686
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,386
I didn't shoot him.

687
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:21,058
They've all gone,
or we killed all they sent.

688
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,060
You shot the one that jumped towards me?

689
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:27,438
Pretty good shootin' for a half-breed,
wouldn't you say?

690
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,360
Let's get outta here.

691
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,873
Let's ride. Hyah!

692
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:22,912
- That's an ambush.
- Must be marshal and the Injuns.

693
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,330
Go find out who won.

694
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,081
- What?
- You heard me.

695
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,351
It's less than a mile away.

696
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,187
Whoever it is, be coming down
this path real soon.

697
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:32,505
Get your ass back here and tell me who.

698
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:35,758
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
taking a crack at MacMasters myself.

699
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,986
You don't touch MacMasters,
you understand me?

700
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,262
If he's alive,
see to it he stays that way.

701
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:43,349
- Yeah, Jed.
- Get outta here.

702
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,023
Posse don't stand a chance
against me up here.

703
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:53,150
I'll mow 'em down.

704
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:01,450
Where the hell is that posse?

705
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:05,454
Where the hell are you?!

706
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,850
Maybe they're not in there.

707
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,464
They know we're followin' them.

708
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:00,342
I think they kept ridin'.

709
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:02,761
I doubt it.

710
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:05,264
Check it out.

711
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:25,576
Take the horses around back and cover us.

712
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:40,299
Ed! Ed Ryan!

713
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,009
Is that you, Marshal?

714
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:45,596
Ed, you come on out peaceful-like.

715
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,766
That's the funniest thing
I've heard all week.

716
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,603
Ed, you stay in there, things are gonna
get a whole lot worse for you.

717
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:56,732
I'm fine. I got three hostages.

718
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,279
Make that two hostages.

719
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,365
Let us ride and they live.

720
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,410
No deal, Ed.

721
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:10,621
One of 'em has a nice little locket.

722
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:14,625
It's got a picture inside.
It looks like you!

723
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,294
What the hell is he talking about?

724
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:20,673
Laura came out here
this afternoon to visit.

725
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,257
Goddammit.

726
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:26,053
- Ed?
- Yeah?

727
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,098
You let them go,
and I'll give you one hour head start.

728
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,725
All right, Marshal. We're comin' out.

729
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:18,230
Laura...

730
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,169
They wanted us to think
she was one of them.

731
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,611
Laura...

732
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:27,197
Oh, God.

733
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:31,910
Laura, Laura, don't leave me.

734
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:32,995
Don't leave me.

735
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:34,913
Laura.

736
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:37,332
Oh, God, no. Oh, God.

737
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,421
Oh, God, stay with me.
Stay with me.

738
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:46,050
Stay with me. Stay with me.

739
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,342
God, no, please.

740
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,304
Oh, God, no.

741
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:53,098
Oh, God.

742
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,102
Oh. Laura.

743
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,563
Oh, God.

744
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,191
Laura.

745
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,319
I'm so sorry.

746
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:24,505
Many tracks have joined Jed's gang.
They are being followed.

747
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,801
- Can you tell how many?
- No.

748
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:30,803
Think they've already been attacked?

749
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:34,431
Tracks are less than a day old.
It is possible.

750
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:36,100
Let's get moving.

751
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:38,769
I think we should wait here till sunrise.

752
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,437
Burnin' moonlight.

753
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:43,107
Trail's gettin' very difficult
to read now.

754
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,900
That's why you're here.

755
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:49,196
The warriors following them
may also know of us.

756
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,448
With sunlight, I can be certain.

757
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:56,870
I think you were right about my eyes.
They are getting old.

758
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:59,081
Not as good in the dark
as they used to be.

759
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,253
Well, sun rises in two hours.

760
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:06,004
We'll wait till then.

761
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:09,299
Oh, good. Two more hours of sleepin'
on hard rocks.

762
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:15,097
What the hell was that?

763
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,991
Saddle the horses,
we may need 'em in a hurry.

764
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,810
- Where are you goin'?
- Just stay here, keep alert.

765
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:49,381
- Is that a war dance?
- It is a celebration.

766
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:51,382
Oh.

767
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:56,180
It'd take hours to reach 'em.

768
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,473
And they'd gone by the time we do.

769
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,353
MacMasters?

770
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,067
MacMasters.

771
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,236
Five Sioux...

772
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,906
circlin' around to a front.

773
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:16,742
War paint.

774
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,491
Tucker!

775
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,202
Tucker.

776
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:45,998
- Tucker.
- Marshal.

777
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,754
Don't bet that bank yet.

778
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:57,592
I think me and Chaska...

779
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:01,263
I think we're even.

780
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,102
Tucker...

781
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,022
Tucker.

782
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:25,996
Come on, Britt. Britt, come on!

783
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:38,717
What the hell did he mean
when he said we were even?

784
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:43,221
He said he learned the difference
between the Sioux and the Pawnee.

785
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,085
Wake up.

786
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:14,461
Wake up.

787
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,255
Come on, wake up, kid.

788
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:19,484
Sun's about to rise,
we gotta get outta here.

789
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,011
- Injuns?
- Yeah.

790
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:25,889
A little ways back, they attacked us.

791
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,034
We gotta make tracks,
get some distance between us.

792
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:30,227
With my luck, they already killed your pa.

793
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:40,987
Hey, Jed, is that you?

794
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:44,116
Silas? Thought you was dead.

795
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,536
Hell, I thought the same thing about you.

796
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:51,248
When they attacked, I went out back.

797
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:53,250
Tried to pick off an easy few.

798
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:55,252
What happened?

799
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:58,130
Well, my horse fell down,
knocked myself out.

800
01:10:58,213 --> 01:11:00,173
- Came to about an hour ago.
- Damn.

801
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:02,257
Found my horse about a half a mile away.

802
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:04,928
Get up.

803
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,139
Damn.

804
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:09,182
They burned their bodies back there.

805
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:11,101
How many of 'em?

806
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:15,235
Jed, I didn't go back for another look,
but they'll be breakin' camp come mornin'.

807
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,524
We was just gettin' ready to vamoose.

808
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:19,568
Better hurry.

809
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,971
All these Injuns on the ground.

810
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:52,559
I'm sure one more
won't make much difference.

811
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,634
Been hearin' a long time
how fast you are on the draw.

812
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:08,825
Let's find out.

813
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,720
What the hell was that?

814
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:31,640
What the hell!

815
01:12:33,642 --> 01:12:34,642
Silas!

816
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:36,645
Silas!

817
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:42,609
I told him to look, not to attack.

818
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:44,110
Son of a bitch.

819
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,530
Silas! Silas!

820
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,283
You leave MacMasters for me!

821
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:56,373
Son of a bitch.

822
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,088
He's a good scout.

823
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:05,271
If he didn't wanna be seen,
he wasn't seen.

824
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:07,259
Silas!

825
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,438
I ain't afraid of your pa, boy.

826
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:15,607
This is what I've been wantin' all along.

827
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:18,687
But now...

828
01:13:19,688 --> 01:13:22,566
it's just you. No gang. I could...

829
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:26,776
- I could talk to him for ya.
- Talk to him for me?

830
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:30,155
What's the discussion
gonna be about, little mouse?

831
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,658
Where the hanging's gonna be?

832
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:32,951
No.

833
01:13:42,711 --> 01:13:44,045
Hey, little mouse.

834
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:47,048
Go to my saddlebag.
Need another round of ammo.

835
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:48,341
What?

836
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,010
Bullets.

837
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,279
I got eight rounds on me.

838
01:13:51,303 --> 01:13:52,470
Eight?

839
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:57,767
Little mouse, go to my saddlebag,
and give me extra ammo.

840
01:13:57,851 --> 01:13:59,728
We might be in for a long shootout.

841
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:02,646
Okay.

842
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,949
What you limping for?
It's your arm got stuck.

843
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:15,035
I ache all over, Jed.

844
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,786
I think I got the fever.

845
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,760
Hey, what's takin' you so long?

846
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,594
You stick the ammo in your pockets.

847
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:39,142
You best not be up to somethin'.

848
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,393
Tell me, boy!

849
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:46,816
Come on.

850
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,209
Silas.

851
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:07,544
Silas!

852
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:14,427
No!

853
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,602
You know how much work I put into this?!

854
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,271
Do you?!

855
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,568
Do you know how long that took me?!

856
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:32,737
Do you?!

857
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:49,254
I think it's about time
the cat carved up the little mouse.

858
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:51,339
What?

859
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:54,634
You're the only MacMasters here.

860
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:55,903
You're gonna have to do.

861
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,053
Jed, no.

862
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,681
Let's play "Catch the Bullet."

863
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:05,871
Catch the bullet, little mouse.

864
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:09,190
Where you goin'? Catch the bullet!

865
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:10,900
Damn, boy, you can't run!

866
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:14,738
I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!

867
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,281
Stop!

868
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,784
Now we're gonna play "Catch the Bullet."

869
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,830
I'm gonna shoot,

870
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,374
and you either duck or catch it. It's fun.

871
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,686
I don't wanna play "Catch the Bullet."
I can't play "Catch the Bullet."

872
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:31,880
You're a MacMasters.
Of course you can.

873
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:34,132
I need to rid myself of this feeling...

874
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:37,469
this feeling that MacMasters bested me.

875
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,364
Even when he's gone,
I feel like he's bested me,

876
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,289
'cause I ain't the one who killed him.

877
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:45,268
I ain't got no braggin' rights.

878
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,302
Ain't nobody knows what I went through.

879
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:49,272
But you do.

880
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:54,692
That's why you're gonna
catch this bullet one last time.

881
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,870
It's comin' right for you.

882
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:58,572
Jed...

883
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,620
Go, boy! Go!

884
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,958
Ha, yeah!

885
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,242
I'll play
"Catch the Bullet" with ya.

886
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,095
Let him go.

887
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,807
No, I don't really like that idea.

888
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,475
Gotten to know the kid.

889
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,310
Feel like I have to kill him.

890
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:31,939
Get that ammo ready, boy.

891
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,405
Chad, where are you?

892
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,658
- Shoot, Pa, I'm covered!
- Shut up.

893
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:51,626
Dammit! Get that ammo!

894
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,878
You almost got me, MacMasters!

895
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:55,380
That was a good one!

896
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:02,428
Hey, MacMasters!

897
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:03,930
Where's the posse?

898
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,313
How many you got?

899
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,608
You think you rate a posse?

900
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,611
Just me, Jed.

901
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,030
Just you and me, huh?

902
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:23,449
You ever think you'd go out like this?

903
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:25,326
On a butte?

904
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,749
Hey!

905
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:34,168
You ain't shot back in a while, Marshal.

906
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:35,712
You out of ammo?

907
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:38,563
Come on out in the open and find out.

908
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:41,050
Hey, that's a pretty funny joke!

909
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:43,011
You think I'm dumb enough to try?

910
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:48,016
Shoot back, dammit!

911
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,019
Son of a bitch is out of ammo!

912
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:53,104
Your pa is out of ammo!

913
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,982
Jed, you're right.

914
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:58,526
I'm out of ammo.

915
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:03,048
Old teacher of mine once told me
I didn't have a brain for arithmetic.

916
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:05,074
Would you look at that?

917
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:07,410
The great Marshal MacMasters.

918
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:13,666
Listen, Jed, I'll make a deal with ya.

919
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,252
<i>I'm listenin'.</i>

920
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:21,716
You let Chad ride outta here
and I'll stay with you.

921
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:25,178
That's a dumb-ass deal, Marshal.

922
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,389
Don't kill my son, Jed.

923
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:30,892
He's half-dead as it is.

924
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,688
I'm the one you want.

925
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,900
Let him go.

926
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,779
First, you step out with your hands up.

927
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,907
Leave the pistol where you are.

928
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:49,369
All right.

929
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,913
I'm coming down.

930
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:09,847
Walk where I can see ya.

931
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,435
Got your pa now, boy.

932
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,563
No, no.

933
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,361
Keep your hands up.

934
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,208
You stay right there.

935
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,844
Keep your hands nice and high,
just like that.

936
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,181
Let Chad go, Jed.

937
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:55,435
That was your deal, not mine.

938
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,353
Why kill him?

939
01:20:57,437 --> 01:21:01,566
"Cause I don't want him to grow up
into his pa, who's huntin' me down."

940
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:04,277
I think you set him on the road
for that already.

941
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,321
Yeah, guess I did.

942
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:11,242
That's why he dies here
right now with you.

943
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:12,618
That's close enough.

944
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:16,137
Now how about a game
of "Catch the Bullet"?

945
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:18,541
You mind if I have last smoke?

946
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,627
You ain't got a little
pepperbox on you, do you?

947
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:23,129
Nope.

948
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,797
Real slow.

949
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,993
Now tell me about this "Catch the Bullet."

950
01:21:56,996 --> 01:22:00,124
Who catches it? You?

951
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,335
Why ain't you scared?

952
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:05,880
Let's play.

953
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,510
Let's see who catches the bullet.

954
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,305
It's time to make peace with myself.

955
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,689
Come on.

956
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:29,237
I'm here now, son. I'm here.

957
01:22:49,507 --> 01:22:51,300
Don't look at him, look at me.

958
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,761
Look at me, look at me.

959
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,352
It's over, Chad.

960
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:03,020
It's over, I'm here.

961
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:08,734
Oh, son. Oh.

962
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:15,533
Let's get these ropes off of you.

963
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:19,871
Take these off.

964
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,712
I'm real proud of you, son.

965
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:28,963
You are?

966
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,090
You bet I am.

967
01:23:33,718 --> 01:23:36,929
I'm so sorry. I knew you would come.
I'm so sorry.

968
01:23:37,013 --> 01:23:38,347
I knew it.

969
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:39,599
Sorry?

970
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,685
Sorry about what?

971
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,437
It doesn't matter now.

972
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:50,818
Hey, I, uh...

973
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,279
I got somethin'.

974
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:57,116
Starr sent these for ya.

975
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,202
She said they're you're favorite, right?

976
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,211
All right, all right.

977
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,337
Here, you, uh...

978
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:12,006
you hang onto these, okay?

979
01:24:13,341 --> 01:24:14,425
Can you get up?

980
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,469
- Yeah, I think so.
- All right.

981
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:26,312
- So did you really run out of ammo?
- I have plenty in my saddlebag.

982
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,272
<i>- Pa...
- Half mile down the trail.</i>

983
01:24:28,356 --> 01:24:31,734
- That was reckless.
- I'm gettin' old, son.

984
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,402
I don't think so.

985
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:53,839
Well, I'm real sorry, Dex,
I still haven't heard from my posse.

986
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,484
They've been searchin' for days.

987
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:58,928
Well, I just hope they're still alive.

988
01:25:00,972 --> 01:25:04,183
I'll ask Pastor Bailey
to say a prayer from 'em.

989
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:06,727
Well, thank you. Appreciate that.

990
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:09,981
The only family I got.

991
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:13,359
Yeah, I like consider them
the only family I got, too.

992
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,694
Yeah.

993
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:32,461
My eyesight's not so good.
Can you see who that is?

994
01:25:32,545 --> 01:25:35,214
I hope it's not Jed and his boys.

995
01:25:38,426 --> 01:25:41,177
Looks like somebody's comin' this way.
I'm not sure who.

996
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:43,514
But we're gonna have company.

997
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:47,143
Oh, we don't wanna fight.

998
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:54,400
I can't believe my eyes.

999
01:25:59,697 --> 01:26:02,116
It's Britt and Chad.

1000
01:26:03,326 --> 01:26:06,203
I think my eyesight's improvin'.

1001
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:08,831
Welcome home, son.

1002
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,125
Britt!

1003
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,878
You're alive.

1004
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:15,755
Yeah, we're alive.

1005
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:18,758
Grandpa! I thought you was dead!

1006
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:22,595
Well, they tried to get me,
but they failed.

1007
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:27,058
Get up here.

1008
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:30,186
I'm gonna outlive all of ya.

1009
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:38,277
You know, I got a whole posse
out there looking for you.

1010
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:40,988
You want me to head back out,
so they can find me?

1011
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:46,327
Nah. They'll give up eventually,
you ain't that special.

1012
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:48,579
Thanks a lot, Sheriff.

1013
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:51,957
Come on, let's get you inside.

1014
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:54,342
There's a shot of whiskey
with your name on it.

1015
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:56,688
Lord knows you deserve it.

1016
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:59,131
I'll take it.
