1
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,578
Come, there are limits to
what the human mind can bear.

2
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,141
Father.

3
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,423
A turkey, turkey with chestnuts.

4
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,825
And Bellerophon became melancholy.

5
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,708
Alone he readied
the bank of the Allion...

6
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,666
devouring his soul.

7
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,344
Fleeing the roads
frequented by men.

8
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,179
It's always the same.

9
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,180
Every boss is the same.

10
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,705
Nothing new under the sun.

11
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,021
But it's not the same.
This one's harsher.

12
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,387
For me it's the family.
The family Lesurf.

13
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,824
They say he drives a hard bargain,
like the other one.

14
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,185
Yes, but this one knows we
want to strike

15
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,339
and he's afraid.

16
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,068
He tries to protect himself.
He's has guards.

17
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,901
- Guards?
- Armed.

18
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,345
A small beer.

19
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,705
A small glass of white wine.

20
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,107
I haven't paid.

21
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,063
The man's afraid, the mother lies down,
and the son's completely...

22
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,179
What are you reading?

23
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,062
“Kidnapped on her wedding night."

24
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,420
It's beautiful.

25
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,307
Kidnapped on her wedding night.
"It's beautiful."

26
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,947
Butterfly.

27
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,945
Dragonfly.

28
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,426
Grasshopper.

29
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,660
It's not a compliment, it's an insult.
Tell me the price of my drink.

30
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,458
Mr. Ivan, I never know
how to take you.

31
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,222
I'm strange, aren't I?

32
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,779
- Now tell me the price of my beer.

33
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,541
Here's the price of my beer.

34
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,426
What's your name?

35
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,900
Don't tell me you don't have a name.
What's your name?

36
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,741
- My first name?

37
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,343
It's Ginette, Mr. Ivan,
you know that.

38
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,978
Well, Ginette...

39
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,065
Here's a tip for the service.

40
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,867
10 %.

41
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,658
What?

42
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,625
- What did he say to you?
- I don't know.

43
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,667
- Did he say something mad?
- I don't know.

44
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,064
It's not dirty if you don't
know what it means.

45
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,942
The death of his father,
the new marriage...

46
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,782
All the same, they keep it
in the family.

47
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,187
It doesn't surprise me.

48
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,028
His head's empty now,
he wasn't prepared for this.

49
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,145
He's had to grow up, all at once.

50
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,819
That's how it is with the Lesurfs,

51
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,908
The man's good for nothing,
The wife's a beautiful whole.

52
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,422
As for the son...

53
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,904
Why such a pure manner,

54
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,267
when the messenger deliver the most
ignoble words pronounced by Man?

55
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,303
Earth is more beautiful
than asphalt.

56
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,387
Man destroys everything he touches.

57
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,017
I must have been born
in the wrong century.

58
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,300
I should have existed in a lime
where it was possible to live.

59
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,664
Now we've got crows.
Filthy beasts.

60
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,745
What do these crows want from me?

61
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,059
What do they want?

62
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,225
Locked?

63
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,347
I'm locked out.

64
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,822
Even iron slowly rots.

65
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,381
Come on, open.

66
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,428
If you shout you'll frighten them,
and you'll be outside all night.

67
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,619
Who's there?

68
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,626
- Me.
- The password.

69
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,657
I tell you I'm Ivan Lesurf.
You know me, don't you?

70
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,383
- You've got to know the password.
- What does that matter?

71
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,179
I'm the master here.
I won't say another word.

72
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,145
You've got to know the password.

73
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,748
Such are the orders.

74
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,384
I refuse, imbecile.
And I'll throw you out of here.

75
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,660
You'll throw me out? That's good.

76
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,979
You didn't hire me,
how can you throw me out?

77
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,020
Let me in, in the name of God.

78
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,946
What's all this noise?

79
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,064
- He didn't give the password.
- Are you completely mad?

80
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,619
Don't you know that's Mr. Ivan?
Quick, open this gate.

81
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,779
I'm only doing as I was told.

82
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,699
I'll fire him.

83
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,542
Excuse him, Mr. Ivan, he's new.

84
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,108
He's replacing Maximilian,

85
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,704
who broke his leg.

86
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,499
Mr. Lesurf has given strict orders,
and he didn't know,

87
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,659
- but he's good.
- He's stupid.

88
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,387
He's not stupid.

89
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,779
For him, discipline is a religion.

90
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,383
Orders are orders.

91
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,501
We must really be on our toes now,

92
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,465
you know.

93
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,699
The strike probably won't end soon.

94
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,383
Mr. Lesurf fears agitators,

95
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,744
he's received death threats.

96
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,626
You think he's in danger?

97
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,585
Well you know,

98
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,457
there's always
a risk of dying.

99
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,146
You clowns there.

100
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,507
You're not paid to beat up weaklings.

101
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,619
“When I'm alone with you,
my thoughts and memories,

102
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,745
"your hand in mine,

103
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,902
“seated at your side I abandon
myself to soft pleasures

104
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,867
"I let the hours pass
into oblivion.

105
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,668
"When in the depth of the forest,
I take you by the hand,

106
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,025
"when your soft sighs alone
beguile my ear,

107
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,987
"I repeat the promises
of the night before,

108
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,822
"I swear to worship only you.

109
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,385
“When finally content
in your sweet rest

110
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,017
"my trembling knees
your only support,

111
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,545
"And with a gaze as
steady as your own

112
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,462
"like the greedy bee
on the leaves of the rose...

113
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,258
Adrien, how well you read.

114
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,778
I read well because I love you.

115
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,978
And because you love me
to read to you.

116
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,579
It isn't just that.
You read well.

117
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,860
- Better than...
- Yes, better than Gabriel.

118
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,346
Hello, my darling.
Did you have a nice walk?

119
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,019
<i>I saw some crows.</i>

120
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,943
- You seem preoccupied.
- No, not at all.

121
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,497
They didn't want to open the gate.

122
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,864
They're so loyal they're stupid.

123
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,908
- Sparkos says you're afraid.
- Not afraid, but taking precautions.

124
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,139
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid of the workers.

125
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,417
What's happening, Adrian?

126
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,383
I'm not afraid of the workers.
Only among them there are instigators.

127
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,939
It isn't that I'm afraid...
but that they want to break me.

128
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,305
Don't worry.

129
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,617
"... And with a gaze
as steady as your own

130
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,183
"like the greedy bee on
the leaves of the rose.

131
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,982
"Often In the depths of
my heart penetrates a sudden terrible wave. "

132
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,147
"... you see me tremble,

133
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,737
“I shudder and, troubled, bound

134
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,343
"suddenly with true happiness...

135
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,747
"I feel your tears and
my soul's amazed...

136
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,588
"I wrap you suddenly
in my affectionate arms...

137
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,587
"You question me... "
Are you trying to keep me from reading?

138
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,067
Me? No. Why?

139
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,306
You could play some other time,
couldn't you?

140
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,737
I regret this is the hour
when I love to play.

141
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,505
Ivan, you want to play?
Then I leave it to you.

142
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,625
Never mind, I've finished.

143
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,705
There's a film tomorrow. Try to get out
of guard duty, we'll go together.

144
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,020
- What's playing?
- I don't remember the title.

145
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,098
A strange title.

146
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,738
- An American film where they fight with swords.
- You like that?

147
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,185
Fights, I love them.

148
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,981
What a lovely beast.

149
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,827
Bravo, Paul.
Give my compliments to Marie.

150
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,503
I hope you haven't spat on it?

151
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,382
Pay no attention, Paul.

152
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,101
- You've been  a big help.
- Please, Ivan...

153
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,460
I'll have more later.

154
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,137
That's not the same thing.
Marie will think

155
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,703
you detest her cooking.

156
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,899
That's how you antagonise
the servants.

157
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,702
- That's enough, Ivan.
- But it's not enough,

158
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,626
you have to taste it first.

159
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,943
- What's the matter?
- Don't you want some fish?

160
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,025
No, I'm certain Paul spat on it.

161
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,942
- Ivan, this is intolerable.
- I agree with you.

162
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,304
Paul is well paid,
lodged and fed.

163
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,983
There's no reason why
he should spit on the food.

164
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,543
Ivan, this foolishness has gone
far enough.

165
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,105
But it's not foolishness.
Paul spat on the food.

166
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,099
Isn't that right, Paul?

167
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,581
Don't deny it, I saw you.

168
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,503
You don't have the light
to say such things, Mr. Ivan.

169
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,028
I don't hold it against you,
Paul, because I know you.

170
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,102
You wouldn't have done such a thing
if you didn't have a good reason.

171
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,546
I suppose that my uncle committed
some injustice against you...

172
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,217
And has no doubt had
spoken to you rudely,

173
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,307
reproaching you for some fault
of which you weren't guilty.

174
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,223
- That's so, isn't it?

175
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,939
Ivan... this game is intolerable.
I command you...

176
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,742
I don't take orders from you.

177
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,667
Besides, Paul knows
I was only joking.

178
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,583
Paul likes me.
Isn't that right, Paul?

179
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,138
I know that your fish is as
good as it is beautiful,

180
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,618
give my compliments to Marie,

181
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,779
but I don't want any.

182
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,107
I don't want anything.

183
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,587
I'm not hungry.

184
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,859
I won't permit games
of this kind.

185
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,987
Forgive me.

186
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,625
- You know what I'm thinking?
- No, my darling.

187
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,983
What are you thinking?

188
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,866
I believe I'm not
comfortable in my skin.

189
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,268
Ale you leaving?

190
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,345
But the meal is not finished.

191
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,306
Excuse me, I have to meet someone.

192
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,904
In any case, you'll find it
agreeable to be left alone.

193
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,662
Eat well, eat a lot,
don't get on each other's nerves.

194
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,299
- Where are you going?
- To Youth.

195
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,506
Youth goes to youth as sin goes
to sin

196
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,784
and as money goes to money.

197
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,463
I'm going to meet Lucy.

198
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,658
- Claudia, my darling.

199
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,542
This can't go on.

200
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,618
Ivan is becoming odious,

201
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,263
as much with you as with me.

202
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,897
- I know.
- Well then?

203
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,304
I can't much longer endure
scenes like this.

204
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,622
Did you understand
his allusion to money?

205
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,939
He thinks he's been robbed.

206
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,901
As if he was capable of handling
what's happening at the factory.

207
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,187
I should have sacked him.

208
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,747
Fortunately you haven't.

209
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,178
You know exactly why I haven't.

210
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,146
Your patience has been wonderful.

211
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,707
And you know perfectly well why
Ivan is in such a state.

212
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,979
L-le can't bear the death
of his father...

213
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,505
and our love, our marriage...
have shattered him.

214
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,385
Of course.

215
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,181
Would you like more fish, Madame?

216
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,786
You must try to understand.

217
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,627
The way he carries on,

218
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,899
for the love of God.

219
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,341
What's wrong?

220
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,342
My dear Claudia, you can see
how upset I am.

221
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,739
Don't be so agitated,
take a chair and sit down.

222
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,626
So, is there a problem?

223
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,578
What's the matter?
Certainly it's not serious.

224
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,981
It's not what you think, Adrian.
The tenants have been dealt with.

225
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,821
And that's not so bad anyway.

226
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,742
No, it's something else.

227
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,547
What's happened, Andre?

228
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,307
You're so distressed.

229
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,502
Distressed? I'm not distressed.
I'm afflicted, that's what.

230
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,979
Listen...
Could I have a glass of wine?

231
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,867
Of course you can, go ahead.

232
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,980
Pardon me, Claudia,
but it's about Ivan.

233
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,028
Yes, Ivan and Lucy.

234
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,299
He's after her.

235
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,825
I can see it. He tries to conceal
what he's after... Telling her stories.

236
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,940
What is this nonsense?

237
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,343
It isn't nonsense, Claudia.

238
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,546
He's got his eye on her.
He's always watching her.

239
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,301
It frightens me.

240
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,059
Ivan and Lucy have known each other all their
lives. They practically grew up together.

241
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,386
I'm not mad, Claudia.
Things have changed.

242
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,539
Ivan's never been that interested

243
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,307
in Lucy.

244
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,021
Or girls in general...

245
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,186
But for some time now...
He looks for her. I tell you...

246
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,822
They're together fight now.

247
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,180
She didn't even finish dinner.

248
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,988
I tell you, something must be done.

249
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,738
I like Ivan a lot.

250
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,939
But he's
a riddle, all that with Lucy...

251
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,979
Since her mother died, she's all

252
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,464
I have and I intend to keep her.

253
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,218
I've been devoted to this family
for fifteen years.

254
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,465
Understand my anguish seeing my daughter
deflowered by your son.

255
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,097
- Come now, Andre.
- Deflowered.

256
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,706
If you don't put a stop to this,
she'll be deflowered.

257
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,146
We'll take care of it.

258
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,786
So I'll return to the main point.

259
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,226
You're disturbed by man's pursuit
of your daughter in general...

260
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,102
And that at this particular moment
he's with her.

261
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,701
Very well.

262
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,104
On your first point we
shall take stock of the situation.

263
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,781
As Claudia says,
we'll take care of it.

264
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,824
And the second point is simple:

265
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,746
You'll find Ivan and tell him
to come back here immediately.

266
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,868
Look at how the light pays homage
to the shapes of the trees.

267
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,780
Look.

268
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,466
The sky is part of nature...

269
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,222
and completes the landscape
with the light and the trees...

270
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,104
Not with men.

271
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,943
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Perfectly.

272
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,105
A leaf such as this one...
summarises all the beauty of nature.

273
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,781
Look.
Laugh again, Lucy.

274
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,942
But I can't.

275
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,179
I beg you.

276
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,662
Excuse me for interrupting you...

277
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,940
- but I can have a laugh too.

278
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,307
Don't play innocent with me,
saw you, you were touching her.

279
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,266
How delightful to meet you.

280
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,268
And you let him do such things?
You think it's funny?

281
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,099
Your uncle demands your presence,
if I were you I'd come immediately.

282
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,260
- Your duty is done.
- Immediately.

283
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,224
Your zeal will be appreciated
in high places.

284
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,423
- One minute.
- Leave me alone.

285
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,387
Aren't you ashamed?
Come on, aren't you ashamed?

286
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,223
What did he do to you?
What did he do?

287
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,379
He described to me
the beauty of nature.

288
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,267
Nature? Yes.
He didn't touch your backside?

289
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,340
No, he smiled at me.

290
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,307
He was touching you, I saw it.

291
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,301
I put out my hand and he took it.

292
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,665
Understand me, my daughter,
you're all I've got.

293
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,343
I can't bear him running after you.

294
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,067
I don't want to lose you

295
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,265
Slut.

296
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,747
Peace be with you.

297
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,068
I tell you I understand people.

298
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,108
But if he continues to subject us to
more and more of his outlandishness...

299
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,228
- You're exaggerating, darling.
- He's the one who exaggerates, darling.

300
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,948
He's odious.

301
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,979
I met her so simply

302
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,266
Without ever trying
to please

303
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,938
All the same

304
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,103
I adore myself
with such a burning love

305
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,262
That there's nothing that could...

306
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,260
displease...

307
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,664
There's going be fights, look.

308
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,105
It's not disturbing, is it?

309
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,181
No, it's a love story. It's starting.

310
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,299
Good Hamlet,
cast thy nighted colour off

311
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,302
And let thine eye look like
a friend on Denmark.

312
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,182
Do not for ever with
thy veiled lids

313
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,062
Seek for thy noble father
in the dust.

314
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,942
Thou knowst 'tis common:

315
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,465
All that lives must die,

316
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,781
Passing through nature
to eternity

317
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,383
Aye Madame, it is common.

318
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,585
If it be...

319
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,341
why seems it so
particular with thee?

320
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,226
"Seems", Madame?

321
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,540
Nay, it is.
I know not seems.

322
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,302
'Iis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother...

323
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,903
Nor customary suits
of solemn black

324
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,662
Nor windy suspiralion
of forced breath

325
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,547
That can denote me truly.

326
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,620
These indeed seem

327
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,985
For they are actions
that a man might play.

328
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,298
But I have that within
that passeth show

329
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,098
These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

330
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,498
11s sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,

331
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,787
to give these mourning duties
to your father.

332
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,417
But you must know your father
lost a father,

333
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,387
that father lost, lost his.

334
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,984
- Come to my room in a little while.

335
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,980
I'll wait for you.

336
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,505
Caligula.

337
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,419
Death.

338
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,379
- Come, let me show you the mirror.
- What are you doing?

339
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,778
Making faces. Look.

340
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,706
Paris needs a Mass.

341
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,303
It all began with the
reign of your brother.

342
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,147
By the name LaGrange,
I know my daughter.

343
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,380
I used to be like you,
I didn't suspect anything.

344
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,984
But she's with him in his room.

345
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,981
They're having a rendezvous,
it's certain.

346
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,903
What's going on up there?
Horrible things...

347
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,388
Won't you do something?

348
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,142
You're being ridiculous, Andre.
Ivan is a gentleman.

349
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,385
Of course he's a gentleman,
I haven't said otherwise.

350
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,744
But even a gentleman...
has his instincts...

351
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,547
That's enough, Andre.

352
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,099
You're acting like a fool.
I order you to be quiet.

353
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,306
But Adrian... it's the honour
of my daughter that's at stake.

354
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,341
The honour of your daughter
is in no danger.

355
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,428
Look.

356
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,428
It's done.

357
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,304
See you later, Ophelia.

358
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,746
- I'm not Ophelia, Ivan.
- If you aren't Ophelia,

359
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,105
you won't kiss
my hand where everyone can see.

360
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,340
I'm Lucy. See you later, Ivan.

361
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,743
To be or not to be.

362
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,704
You're going in there?
The beer is disgusting.

363
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,781
I'm not here for the beer.

364
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,865
Come.

365
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,467
- Hello, Mr. Ivan.
- What have you got there?

366
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,228
It's a mouse. In its trap.

367
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,459
Give me this little beast.

368
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,501
Death.
Don't you recognise Death?

369
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,861
Come sit down.
I was waiting for you.

370
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,908
No, leave it with me.

371
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,423
François my friend, my brother...

372
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,625
Let there be no "Monsieur"
between us.

373
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,428
Have something.
What do you want?

374
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,502
- A glass of red.

375
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,227
Two glasses.

376
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,500
François, you're my only friend.

377
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,308
- You are my friend, aren't you?

378
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,661
I carry a secret that's stifling me
and I can only confide in you.

379
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,817
- Do you accept?

380
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,377
I must unburden my heart.

381
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,626
- Do you know what a murderer is?

382
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,224
- What is it?
- It's someone who kills.

383
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,984
I know a murderer.
I think I know two...

384
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,061
and that each of them has
committed an atrocious crime.

385
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,582
Who?

386
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,782
- My mother and my uncle.
- But that's impossible.

387
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,187
They have.

388
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,057
They killed my father
and then they married.

389
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,708
They killed him so
they could get married.

390
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,984
That's what I think.

391
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,147
I want to unmask them.

392
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,782
Do you know about Hamlet?

393
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,901
He was a prince.

394
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,707
His father the king had died.

395
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,860
He returned from the kingdom of the dead
to tell Hamlet

396
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,225
his brother and wife had
murdered him in the most cowardly way.

397
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,019
You understand?
It's exactly the same situation.

398
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,065
I have clues and evidence that
the same story has repeated itself.

399
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,548
I must act as he did:

400
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,143
To unmask this criminal couple,

401
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,220
I must pretend to be mad.

402
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,302
He terrorised them
until they confessed.

403
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,938
The only means I have
to unmask them...

404
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,179
is to create the same circumstances

405
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,625
that Hamlet did to simulate madness

406
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,543
Some of these circumstances
have already shown themselves.

407
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,620
You could help me create others.

408
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,626
I don't understand any of this.

409
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,059
I'm not asking you to
understand, only to help.

410
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,460
The character I must play is
that of Ivan becoming Hamlet.

411
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,940
The simple fact of his presence,
the fact that I play him,

412
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,304
will in itself be
a clear accusation.

413
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,457
First I must trouble them.

414
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,265
First trouble them, and then
make them worry.

415
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,865
And then they'll be terrified

416
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,219
They must understand they
cannot escape punishment.

417
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,107
They'll understand the failure
of the crime,

418
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,824
their defeat. They'll realise justice
will catch up with them,

419
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,657
and this shall be
a horrible nightmare.

420
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,507
From which they will try to awake,

421
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,504
but they cannot remain awake,
for I will stand before them.

422
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,665
Listen.

423
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,939
This is what I have to do

424
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,020
and this is how you'll help me.

425
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,825
- Are you listening?

426
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,098
I'll set a trap for them.

427
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,859
In order to unmask his mother and
his uncle,

428
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,860
Hamlet set a trap.

429
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,146
So he could trap them like rats.

430
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,381
This will be mine:
You and I will make a film.

431
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,744
- We'll make a film?

432
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,027
But tell no one the reason for it.

433
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,385
The subject of the film,
in disguised form,

434
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,098
will be the murder of my father by
my uncle and my mother.

435
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,657
When we show the film...

436
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,707
the mousetrap will enclose them.

437
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,660
- Do you want to?

438
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,228
Really?

439
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,403
Can Ginette be in it?

440
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,459
Very well, but don't tell her the reason.
You must not tell her the reason.

441
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,779
I promise.

442
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,422
What do you want?

443
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,740
I'm going to make a film with Ivan.
Do you want to be in it?

444
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,502
A film? I don't know.

445
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,501
We'll be the stars.

446
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,904
What are you doing?

447
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,297
You've lost it.

448
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,903
What are you men doing?

449
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,503
You talk, you walk but
you're so soft about it.

450
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,228
Act like men, for Christ sake.

451
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,098
Who laughed?

452
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,778
Me.

453
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,343
What makes you laugh, Matton...

454
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,227
with your voice like a Virgin's?

455
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,626
Nothing, nothing.

456
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,466
We're not paid to sit around
doing nothing.

457
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,508
It could happen at any moment,
understand?

458
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,705
Lsurf sleeps and we're awake.

459
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,223
That's what we're paid for.

460
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,743
And he's too afraid to sleep
with his eyes closed.

461
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,588
Monsieur is a rich man...

462
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,628
And the rich are afraid of
being robbed and killed.

463
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,226
That's what politics is all about.

464
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,584
So Lesurfs afraid of the strikers?

465
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,779
It's all the same.

466
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,542
They strike because
they need money.

467
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,338
And Lsurf doesn't want
to give it to them.

468
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,468
He's afraid the others
will kill him to get his money.

469
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,417
And he pays us to prevent it.

470
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,862
He'd do better

471
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,183
just to give it to them.

472
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,220
No, idiot.

473
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,858
Because he's afraid that they'd
just want more.

474
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,338
There's someone

475
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,902
in the woods.

476
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,384
Come on. The hunt's on.

477
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,224
Search.

478
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,861
Spread out.

479
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,940
Cretin. You dumb animal.

480
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,224
Trying to get yourself killed?

481
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,458
This way.

482
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,462
<i>What's happened“?</i>

483
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,427
- An alert. There's a man in the woods.
- What?

484
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,922
Quick, close the door.

485
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,899
What's going on?
Why are you wearing that cap?

486
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,025
Didn't you hear the gunfire?

487
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,102
 Is that all you can say?

488
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,384
It made me turn my head.

489
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,508
It's me they're after.

490
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,104
They thought I wanted to kill
the beloved Adrian.

491
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,783
Because of the cap and the scarf.

492
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,868
If I'd worn my bowler hat...

493
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,338
They wouldn't have worried.

494
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,343
People always confuse things

495
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,499
with their appearances.

496
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,788
don't start that again.

497
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,703
I know the story of Hamlet.
Ophelia was a blonde.

498
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,218
I love your blondness, Ophelia.

499
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,657
Behind Lucy stands

500
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,944
the blonde Ophelia.

501
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,578
Ivan, I think I know what
you have in mind.

502
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,058
- Really?

503
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,700
And I'm afraid it will make you...
I'm afraid you're going mad.

504
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,267
On the contrary...

505
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,182
it's everything else
that will make me mad.

506
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,662
- To endure all this and do nothing...

507
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,859
You want to have your way
in my house now?

508
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,621
Not at all.

509
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,257
I came on behalf of my uncle,

510
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,659
that is on behalf of my father,
that is on behalf of Adrian,

511
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,822
to invite you to lunch,
you and your Channing daughter.

512
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,221
- But I just saw him, he said nothing.
- Because he left it to me.

513
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,779
Then I thank you, Adrian...
I mean Ivan.

514
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,985
I accept with pleasure.

515
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,021
See you soon

516
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,418
- Well?
- He vanished like a puff of smoke.

517
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,979
Incompetent.
Good for nothing. Idiot.

518
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,464
Go on, keep looking.

519
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,468
What's going on, Smurkos?
I heard gunfire.

520
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,221
"Smarkos", Mr. Ivan.

521
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,824
We're hunting a fleeing suspect,
always on the lookout.

522
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,263
My uncle will be happy.

523
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,778
My precautions were for nothing.
Those bastards.

524
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,861
What happened?
I heard gunfire.

525
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,859
A strange man invaded the park.

526
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,986
And your uncle's received
another threatening letter.

527
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,708
Letters have never been
that important.

528
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,268
The man hasn't been caught?

529
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,307
I don't think so. He got away.

530
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,459
Perhaps it was a ghost.

531
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,746
I've invited Andre and Lucy on
your behalf to have lunch with us.

532
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,821
Are you mad?
This isn't the time.

533
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,183
What's done is done.

534
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,221
Could you pass me the salt...
Polonius?

535
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,585
- Polonius? Don't know him.
- Obviously not.

536
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,138
You've got other things to do.

537
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,948
Eat, for example.

538
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,457
One cannot eat

539
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,945
before reading
the poet's letters.

540
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,299
Isn't that right, Papa?

541
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,388
You're awful.

542
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,828
You're stupid.

543
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,064
You're old.

544
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,025
You're vulgar.

545
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,741
That's enough, be quiet.

546
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,177
Leave me alone.

547
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,982
When I'm assailed on all sides,
I must speak.

548
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,420
But what possesses him?

549
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,938
Do you know where
Mother spent Christmas?

550
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,103
In a cabaret.

551
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,304
They threw streamers.

552
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,468
They put on turbans.

553
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,699
They broke plates over
each other's heads.

554
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,538
And she danced.

555
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,900
Christmas,

556
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,862
The holiday of God...

557
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,944
and of children.

558
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,062
It's enough to make you sick.

559
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,226
Everything should be forbidden.

560
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,544
Under pain of death.

561
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,178
Under pain of being
kicked in the arse.

562
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,146
This time I think
I finally understand.

563
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,101
He's a drunkard, a degenerate,
completely mad.

564
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,023
You'll never see him again.
I say you'll never see him again.

565
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,942
You hear me?
You understand?

566
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,138
- I forbid it.
- Or else what?

567
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,466
Aren't you sleeping?

568
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,300
You can't stay here.

569
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,742
It's forbidden.

570
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,185
I love you, Ophelia.

571
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,261
Ivan, I've got something
serious to say to you.

572
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,225
Say it.

573
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,105
I can't see you anymore if
things remain as they are.

574
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,383
If they remain how?

575
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,777
You know very well.

576
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,259
You're bitter, cruel, unbearable.

577
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,378
You think so?

578
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,824
You've been listening to Lagrange.

579
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,946
My father has forbidden me
to see you anymore.

580
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,219
Obedient little girlie.

581
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,499
You know it's not that.

582
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,786
An obedient little girl who no
longer wants to be my friend.

583
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,502
No, I don't want to be your friend.
And I don't want to see you either.

584
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,546
Not because my father orders me.

585
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,706
- But for my own reasons.
- Why?

586
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,300
Because you hate people.

587
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,308
On the contrary, I love them.

588
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,381
But I can't bear their turpitude.

589
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,621
They ruin everything,
they break everything.

590
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,777
Evil is hidden in them.

591
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,267
It makes their actions vile,
it infects their thoughts

592
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,937
I don't know what to tell you,

593
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,503
but I'm sure you're wrong.

594
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,666
I love you, I love being near you, .

595
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,064
But you frighten me.

596
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,662
I fear for you.

597
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,384
- You fear for me? My angel...

598
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,737
Even if you're light, you act
strangely, and it frightens me.

599
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,986
There's something bad
in how you behave.

600
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,347
No, it's what surrounds me
that's bad.

601
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,587
It isn't me.

602
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,338
Become yourself again,
don't evade reality.

603
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,100
That's what I'm looking to do.

604
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,947
Do as you please.
For now leave me alone.

605
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,503
my love.

606
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,137
Here I see you descend into
your tomb

607
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,941
in the first light of day?

608
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,138
Here in your madness
you are dead, Ophelia...

609
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,982
because I am just?

610
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,504
Or, if I am not just,

611
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,104
is it because Evil is
all around me?

612
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,586
I've known those who were
gracious and amusing,

613
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,899
good and just.

614
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,628
But who are now
nothing more than dust.

615
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,581
How could you not think of it?

616
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,504
Life is good.

617
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,777
- You like this work?
- Certainly.

618
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,667
You're outside,
you breathe the fresh air...

619
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,707
and nobody bothers you
while you work.

620
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,065
And then it's good soil,
like butter.

621
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,458
Have you been a gravedigger for long?

622
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,377
This is my first grave.
But my father dug graves for thirty years.

623
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,546
An excellent gravedigger,
well-known around here.

624
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,668
With him, never any problems,
infiltrations, nothing like that.

625
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,860
Never.

626
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,777
He's the one who taught me.
I hope to keep at it.

627
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,628
For whom are you
preparing this grave?

628
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,497
I'm digging without digging,
you could say.

629
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,585
In short, I'm digging.

630
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,503
The lease has expired,
so I have to remove the cadaver.

631
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,221
And where will you put it?

632
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,221
In potter's field.

633
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,658
Nobody wanted to
pay for another lease.

634
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,468
And you can't just leave him.

635
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,428
Would you like to act in a comedy?

636
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,467
I'm making a film.
Would you like to be in it?

637
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,864
I was in the choir in school.

638
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,143
Why?

639
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,700
Because I must make a film,
and I'd like you to act in it.

640
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,700
You have a cheerful air.

641
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,781
I'm not the sad type.

642
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,384
I'd love to, as long as it
doesn't interfere with my work.

643
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,058
- Absolutely not.
- Alright then.

644
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,499
Sir, you'll have to excuse me,
but I have to get back to work.

645
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,621
- These things don't wait.
- Go right ahead.

646
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,027
You're dead.

647
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,340
No, I'm not dead.

648
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,863
Don't fight.
Don't fight and don't argue.

649
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,823
Imagine that Death is standing
up there at the turning.

650
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,177
Be good...

651
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,824
And be good to yourselves.

652
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,465
Forget that you're acting.
Forget yourselves.

653
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,780
Don't gesticulate merely for
the pleasure of doing so,

654
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,898
but then don't forbid
yourselves either.

655
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,220
I chose you because I want you
to play yourselves.

656
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,385
Don't imitate other people.

657
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,581
Don't try to make your
audience understand.

658
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,382
Only make them understand
what you're saying.

659
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,303
And that you understand the
nuances of your characters.

660
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,068
Your characters don't exist.

661
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,984
Only you do.

662
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,344
- Understand?

663
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,147
Another thing.

664
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,144
Be modest:

665
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:11,019
Don't try to get yourself noticed
on the screen or elsewhere.

666
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,186
There is nothing important
about the actor.

667
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,106
Acting is honourable. Nothing more.

668
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,863
So no plunging necklines
or funny get-ups.

669
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,544
No laughing out loud...
or listening to us talking.

670
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,065
Finally, no quarrelling over
the opening credits,

671
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,301
over the size and order
of your names.

672
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,903
That would be
perfectly ridiculous...

673
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,738
and perfectly vulgar.

674
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,667
- Yes, but...
- Silence, not a word. .

675
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,546
We'll begin.

676
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,588
- Mother, Uncle...
- What is it?

677
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,628
I'm making a film with young
people in the village.

678
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,219
It's to surprise you.
Would you like to see it?

679
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,220
- You made it?

680
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,258
That's very good.

681
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,142
Bravo, Ivan. Congratulations.

682
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,938
I never thought you were
capable of such work.

683
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,260
You seem very mysterious
these days.

684
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,426
- You really want to see it?
- Certainly darling, with pleasure.

685
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,386
Not only do we want to see it...

686
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,899
but we'll organise a party
in your honour.

687
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,100
And we'll invite all our friends
to come see your masterpiece.

688
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,505
Plus the servants, Sparkos and
his men, everyone will be invited.

689
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,504
How wonderful.
I didn't realise,

690
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,898
I didn't hope for so much.

691
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,583
- Are you pleased?
- I'm delighted.

692
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,301
<i>Kiss me.</i>

693
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,063
- Is it good?
- So, this film...

694
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,982
- You'll be seeing it, Madame.
- What type of film is it?

695
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,184
That depends on the audience.

696
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,817
You could find it funny, or
you could find it painful.

697
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,740
But we won't know how to react.

698
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,788
Laugh only if you feel like it.

699
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,583
Is it going well?

700
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,018
- Very well, Mr. Ivan.
- Is it ready?

701
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,900
- Ready.
- Then let's go. My friends,

702
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,584
the show is about to begin.

703
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,986
We'll move to the parlour.

704
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,826
Ladies and gentlemen...

705
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,225
allow me to present
the cast of the film.

706
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,906
Dear Andre.

707
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,188
If you would be so kind
as to sit there.

708
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,419
Ophelia, I want you to
stay near me.

709
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,184
When the decisive moment comes,
the light will finally break.

710
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,457
It's ready.

711
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,942
Put out your cigarettes.

712
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,941
M. Ferlus, grocer,
doted upon by his wife,

713
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,226
does the monthly accounts.

714
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,542
For some time now, the store
hasn't prospered.

715
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,779
Madame Ferlus isn't happy.

716
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,422
Fred, the brother of M. Ferlus,

717
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,227
drops by to say hello.

718
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,502
But he has another end in mind.

719
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,900
M. Ferlus is stubborn.

720
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,668
Madame Ferlus is sensual.

721
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,463
And Fred knows how to
make the most of it.

722
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,579
They must remove the obstruction.

723
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,101
How great is
woman's treachery.

724
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,499
As great as the treachery of men.

725
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,184
So impatience has paid off.

726
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,508
Crime has paid.

727
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,427
But your story is horrible.

728
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,023
Very well, very good.
My compliments.

729
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,866
I found it a little... twisted.

730
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,188
Very funny.

731
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,863
That really made me laugh.

732
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,180
Crime has paid.
That's normal.

733
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,027
- I liked the beautiful girl.
- It was funny.

734
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,218
And what should I do, Mr. Ivan?

735
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,861
Nothing.

736
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,264
I know it's late...

737
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,499
But what do you think of
my cinematic talent?

738
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,945
- Go away.
- Didn't you like it?

739
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,508
You're a fool.

740
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,177
What you have done
is contemptible.

741
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,464
How could I have been so blind?
You hate everyone.

742
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,700
You're a monster.

743
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,179
You'll be cast
out like a dangerous beast.

744
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,385
What you've done to Adrian,
my husband...

745
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,825
Adrian isn't your husband,
he's the brother of your husband.

746
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,544
You know what that's called?
Incest.

747
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,338
Did you give your mouth, your body
to the other while my father lived?

748
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,505
Ivan, I beg you.

749
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,541
He killed my father
for money and for lust.

750
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,103
It was no longer enough
to have you in his bed.

751
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,825
What is this nightmare? Where do
you get these frightful visions?

752
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,541
I accuse the two of you
of incest

753
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,342
- and murder.
- Be quiet.

754
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,306
Why, my God, why?

755
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,664
We are only animals...

756
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,779
and our hearts rot
before our bodies do.

757
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,341
The solution is simple.

758
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,704
He's gone mad.

759
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,788
You can't let a madman go free.

760
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,859
I don't like speaking like this.

761
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,341
But in my opinion,
he must be watched.

762
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,266
But it's impossible.

763
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,260
Have you got another idea?

764
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,500
We've got to do something, Claudia.

765
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,784
Perhaps at this very moment
he's preparing more mischief.

766
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,504
Who knows what's
going on in his head?

767
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,340
His solitary walks worried me.

768
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,180
And I was right.

769
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,300
Did you talk to him about
his charming film?

770
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,305
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

771
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,500
He's certainly going to
meet someone.

772
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,386
- But who?
- Not my daughter at any rate.

773
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,942
She's locked up, well locked up.

774
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,782
I interrogated her last night about that film.
I promise you, she had nothing to do with it.

775
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,821
She didn't even know about it,

776
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,941
- She hadn't seen him for two weeks.
- What does that matter?

777
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,062
- I defend my honour.
- Your name is spotless, Andre.

778
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,066
- Could you do me a favour?
- Don't you treat me like a friend anymore?

779
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,261
What does that matter?
I'd like you to watch Ivan.

780
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,139
What do you say?

781
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,460
- Could you do this for me?
- Gladly. What do you think?

782
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,302
Spend all your time on his trail.

783
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,863
I'm afraid he'll
find out something.

784
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,140
And I can no longer live in fear.

785
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,867
Go.

786
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,344
It's succeeded beyond
my wildest hopes.

787
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,737
But I'm alone now.

788
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,940
I've got no one but you,

789
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,423
Dear Horatio.

790
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,506
The bastard.

791
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,501
My poor heart.

792
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,383
A nest of jays.

793
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,582
Things don't mean the same
to you that they do to me.

794
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,585
You're brave, kind.

795
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,107
You can bear the faults
of the world...

796
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,781
for you don't see them.

797
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,139
But for me, they burn my eyes.

798
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,017
Everyone says you've become mean,
but for me it's the opposite.

799
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,383
Dear Horatio...

800
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,147
What's he doing up there?

801
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,147
Good Polonius.

802
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,705
Are you getting closer to Heaven?

803
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,700
Mr. Ivan, I think he's dead.

804
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,178
Trees bear strange fruit
these days.

805
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,862
Rats.

806
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,423
Rats in the trees.

807
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,460
- Go and get help.

808
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,467
Poor Lucy.

809
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,063
Look at me.

810
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,178
I'm sleeping.

811
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,897
Look how I sleep.

812
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,506
I sleep, but I can see you.

813
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,106
You stroke your hair.

814
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,584
You take off your coat.

815
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,861
You arrange flowers.

816
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,821
Stop it, you're frightening me.

817
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,421
I wanted to frighten you.

818
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,224
To keep you from crying.

819
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,858
Your father is dead.

820
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,738
Paul, have you seen Andre?

821
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,864
It's the first time in 15 years
he's been late.

822
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,827
- He won't be coming.
- Why not?

823
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,540
- He's at supper.
- He's eating supper?

824
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,705
I didn't say he was eating supper,

825
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,666
but that he was at supper.

826
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,024
Not when he eats...

827
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,497
but where he is eaten.

828
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,946
I don't mean to bother you, but

829
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,504
I found M. Lagrange in a tree.

830
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,384
Did you say diamonds?

831
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,660
Stop talking rubbish.
It's up to you.

832
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,462
- Good play.
- You're playing for sous?

833
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,343
- What do you expect?
- You playing?

834
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,458
<i>1 am.</i>

835
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,540
"All professional categories. "

836
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,826
"Stop the massacre,
that's all that matters."

837
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,344
- Are you having a drink?

838
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,341
Leave me, I have to think.

839
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,464
Alone won't do.

840
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,300
Fine, I'll be upstairs.

841
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:38,302
Forgive me,
I have to think things over.

842
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,865
More than anything,
we need to pray.

843
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,859
You can't protect yourself.

844
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,864
Why should I have to protect myself?

845
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,661
I've done nothing.

846
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,386
No more than the others.

847
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:51,548
And no-one's a saint.

848
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,818
Why am I hounded?

849
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,059
I need to forget.

850
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,977
Why do I suffer?

851
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,547
Why does he make me suffer?

852
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,223
His madness infects me.

853
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,458
Claudia abandons me.

854
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,265
I can't take it anymore.

855
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,865
I'm going to kill him.

856
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,742
Sparkos... I want to talk to you.

857
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,017
Sparkos, give me your revolver.

858
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,583
My revolver? What for?

859
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,301
Because I need it.

860
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,938
I depend on my revolver, sir.
I need it.

861
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,827
Lend me your revolver, I'll give
it back. That's an order.

862
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,221
- But why do you need it?
- Come on.

863
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,546
These things aren't for you, sir.

864
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,540
Leave it to me.

865
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,580
Give it to me.

866
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,907
You're making a mistake, M. Lesurf.

867
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,526
Not a word.

868
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,341
You know me, sir...

869
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,743
At least I paid for it.

870
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,898
Understand Elise,

871
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,787
with what
goes on in this house...

872
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,738
we won't be servants much
longer, soon we'll be the masters.

873
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,661
You've come to kill me, uncle?

874
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,107
<i>What's happened?</i>

875
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,184
M. Lsurf

876
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,220
took poison. He's going to die.

877
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,822
Get out.

878
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,540
I don't want you to look at me.

879
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,298
I hate you.

880
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,820
- My darling...
- I hate you.

881
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,380
I don't want you to look at me.

882
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,906
I feel like I'm abominable.

883
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:49,383
Monster. Don't stay here.

884
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,947
Well?

885
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,267
You're dying?

886
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,984
I'm dying.

887
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,221
Are you happy?

888
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,625
Less than I imagined.

889
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,262
I wanted to tell you...

890
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,658
It should make you laugh:

891
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,618
that you'll be damned.

892
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,182
It hurts.

893
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,147
You die like a rat.

894
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,982
Why like a rat?

895
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,822
- It hurts.
- And as for me...

896
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,064
I suffer too.

897
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,385
To the point I can't
stand it anymore.

898
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,578
What?

899
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,308
I can't live for long.

900
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,143
How death hurts.

901
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,504
Don't speak.

902
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,982
I have to.

903
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,664
I must tell you...

904
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,019
that you were wrong.

905
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,148
That you've been completely wrong.

906
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,582
And that you'll always
suffer for it.

907
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,819
I only killed myself.

908
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,988
I couldn't hurt a fly.

909
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,424
And yet...

910
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,707
I feel like a criminal.

911
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,347
Why?

912
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,017
Yes, why?

913
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,299
You don't know.

914
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,821
I feel the same way and
I don't understand.

915
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,748
What?

916
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,264
Do you think that Death...

917
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,261
is the end of this pain?

918
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,185
Of all my pain.

919
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,108
I don't know.

920
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:15,107
Do you think that I'll be happy?

921
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,622
I don't know.

922
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,463
My Ivan.

923
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,505
My son.

924
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,468
What have I done?

925
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,860
Why did I want justice?

926
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,698
I judged him, I condemned him.

927
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,545
And I killed him.

928
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,540
He loved me and
I killed him, Ophelia.

929
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,584
What have I become?

930
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,100
You're what you've always been.
You're Ivan.

931
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:14,381
And I'm not Ophelia, but Lucy.

932
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,300
It's Lucy who is next to you.

933
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:20,223
Lucy, my love.

934
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:25,227
Support me, protect me, defend me.

935
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,866
I love you.

936
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,860
