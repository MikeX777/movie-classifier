1
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,112
I've prayed for them
every day of my life, but

2
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:22,889
when you came I begged
you to leave. I am not ready.

3
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,474
Isaiah, the prophet.

4
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:00,969
Help! Help...

5
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:22,532
Come on, come on!

6
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:32,000
No, no, no!

7
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:18,053
CALL VOICE MESSAGE.
VICTOR. CALL ME.

8
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,937
WE ARE WAITING FOR INSTRUCTIONS.
YOUR FATHER ASKED ABOUT YOU.

9
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,961
Where are you? You took
me, you didn't let us stay.

10
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,859
They blocked all the entrances, and
no one told me what was happening.

11
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:30,428
Please answer me!

12
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:35,534
Yes, it's very strange, even though
it's already two o'clock in the afternoon.

13
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:39,687
Be careful, people are
so panicked, it scares me.

14
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,125
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

15
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,610
Idiots! Your father will
kill you if he hears that.

16
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:49,072
OK, fine, I trust you, you take

17
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,925
care of it, but don't
let him find out,

18
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,660
if not, it's no longer a surprise. Okay?

19
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,472
OK, I don't want to
send you a long voicemail

20
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,207
telling you what to do.
I believe you, okay?

21
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:00,583
Kiss.

22
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,433
Hello?

23
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,706
Hello?

24
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:42,414
Hello?

25
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,715
Hello?

26
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:48,814
Hello?

27
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:58,407
Hello?

28
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:03,949
Hello? Is anybody there?

29
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,082
Hello? Yes! Hello!

30
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,253
Hello, who's talking?

31
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,548
Banish.

32
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:23,302
Banish? What is that?

33
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:27,848
Nickname. Not important.

34
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:30,476
You don't need to
explain it to me, buddy.

35
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,228
Tell me, where did
you get this frequency?

36
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,689
He wrote on the wall.

37
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:38,859
I tried it.

38
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:42,613
Written on the wall. Okay.

39
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,574
Are you alone?

40
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,785
Yes.

41
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,846
Give me an honest answer.

42
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,373
Anyone following you?
Are you going alone?

43
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,919
Listen, I haven't
seen anyone in days,

44
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,630
this is not for fun.

45
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:03,592
OK, OK, that's fine. I'm
just asking as a precaution.

46
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,222
There's something stalking
us that I'd better avoid.

47
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:11,683
I stay on this frequency.

48
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,813
Where exactly did you find it?

49
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,484
In an abandoned building.

50
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:25,072
This building is very large and has
several rooms and storage space downstairs.

51
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:29,159
But it's been looted.

52
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,748
Yes, I know which building you mean.
I was nearby.

53
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,060
Did you find anything?

54
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:42,339
Yes. A can I can't open.

55
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:48,846
You don't have a knife or
something else you can use?

56
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:53,934
I'm not a Boy Scout.

57
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:58,230
It's okay, at least you can.

58
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,151
I really want a steak sandwich.

59
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:05,696
With fried potatoes and eggs.

60
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:12,035
Stop, this is torture!
I could eat a dog now.

61
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:17,166
What's your name?
Where are you now?

62
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:23,255
Sorry I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Demian.

63
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,049
I'm in a building.

64
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:29,612
I heard noises and preferred
to wait until the area was quiet.

65
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:32,723
It's been days since I
last talked to anyone.

66
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,725
What does it sound like?

67
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,103
Noise, screams and gunshots.

68
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:44,234
I've been where you are.
But the situation is very bad.

69
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,112
Dangerous, better wait.

70
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:48,906
Where are you now?

71
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,993
Can you give me a hint?

72
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,543
Demian?

73
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,381
Demian?

74
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:54,429
I don't know, they
evacuated us to the west.

75
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:58,725
I'll tell you where exactly, but
please, drop everything and come here.

76
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:47,316
Don't do it if you're not sure.

77
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,993
Hi! Are you there? Answer.

78
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,122
Hello, what happened?

79
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:04,434
Sorry, I have to maintain radio silence,

80
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,002
I heard voices and had to move.

81
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,047
Where are you now?

82
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,174
I'm heading your way.

83
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:16,094
This will take time, I
have to take a detour.

84
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,722
Are you still in the warehouse?

85
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:22,642
Yes, I'm still here.

86
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:24,770
Okay.

87
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,068
Do you have a car?

88
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:38,075
No, mate, that's a luxury.
Why do you ask that?

89
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:41,078
Well, I have a car.

90
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,915
But the battery is empty.

91
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,709
Is it true?

92
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,170
Sorry about the battery.

93
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:52,631
Do you want to go on holiday?

94
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,050
I just want to get out of here.

95
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,804
But there is a blockade.

96
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,699
With the military everywhere,
this will be difficult for you.

97
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:05,078
But there are some
warehouses north of your position,

98
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:08,206
maybe you can find
batteries or something there.

99
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,568
But why do you want to go?
There's nothing there.

100
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:16,196
I don't care.

101
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,201
I understand.

102
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:02,409
Help!

103
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:17,984
Help!

104
00:26:44,678 --> 00:26:47,681
Help!

105
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:26,303
Help!

106
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,607
Give it back to me!

107
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:55,061
Hello Bannen, can you hear me?

108
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,314
Hello Demian!

109
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:00,441
Where are you?

110
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:01,794
I still need time,
I have to take

111
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:05,279
a detour, a lot of movement.

112
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:07,198
Yes, me...

113
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,409
I have to leave the building.

114
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,121
I'm so scared!

115
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:17,291
Bloodsucker? Damn.

116
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:20,419
Listen, don't
believe their voice.

117
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,463
Yes I know.

118
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:26,259
I thought it was someone, but...

119
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:30,179
I also do not know.

120
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:34,725
That's why I'm telling you.
Where are you now?

121
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:40,565
I had to jump over the
wall in the other direction.

122
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:45,361
Now I'm in a greenhouse.

123
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:47,321
Have you strayed too far?

124
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,367
Two blocks, more or less,

125
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,452
far from the road.

126
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:54,972
Yes, that's great, mate.

127
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:57,790
This is getting complicated.
Keep your head down, okay?

128
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,086
I will pass this creature.

129
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,424
At least I have a gun.

130
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,472
Demian?

131
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:15,975
Yes I'm here.

132
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:19,520
So you have a gun?
Do you know how to use it?

133
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:22,398
I tried, but I couldn't.

134
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,276
What do you mean you can't?

135
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,778
Have you checked
to see if it's loaded?

136
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,614
I don't know.

137
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,117
Have you prepared the weapon?

138
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:38,080
Listen, there's usually a
button next to the handle.

139
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:40,767
Can take out the bullet magazine.

140
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,877
Check the cartridge.

141
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:47,048
Then plug it back in and
make sure the fuse is on.

142
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:51,302
There's a button here.

143
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,307
Now pull, like in the movies.

144
00:37:59,185 --> 00:38:01,020
Done.

145
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:03,231
Now I understand.

146
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:07,276
You're Charles Bronson.

147
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,659
When I was little,

148
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:18,746
I always go to my
grandparents' house.

149
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:26,337
I love camping in their park.

150
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,678
I went on Sunday.

151
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,976
I love it when it rains.

152
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:43,479
That's another life, my friend.

153
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:47,817
Yes.

154
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:51,654
Time passes quickly.

155
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:53,793
And suddenly you wake
up and see everything

156
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,534
so it's like hell.

157
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,553
Banish, did you hear that?

158
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:18,180
Yes, what is that?

159
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,476
"Nephilim," he sounded
like the powerful type.

160
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:26,147
I find his voice very calming.

161
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,818
No, no, you're crazy.

162
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:35,865
You don't know me.

163
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:52,298
Banish, did you see it?

164
00:39:52,882 --> 00:39:56,260
No, I just heard it.

165
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:02,016
In my opinion, there is no
point in continuing to fight.

166
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:08,606
But you have to do something, right?

167
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,609
Yes, they definitely do.

168
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,903
Oh okay.

169
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,530
Are you sure

170
00:40:16,822 --> 00:40:22,370
one of those existentialist,
nature-loving hippies, right?

171
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,915
You're an asshole.

172
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,589
Listen, let's get some quiet for now.

173
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:36,175
I'll contact you later.

174
00:40:36,342 --> 00:40:38,552
Understand. Understand.

175
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:46,578
Hello, your father told
me you two had a fight.

176
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:50,481
I don't want to interfere,
and I won't interfere.

177
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:54,127
But why do you always fight?

178
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,862
With all the love you
have for each other.

179
00:40:57,029 --> 00:40:59,698
He already knows you
have good intentions.

180
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:02,034
And you, you know him.

181
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,578
He was as stubborn as a hedgehog.

182
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:07,039
That's what he
always told you: "If

183
00:41:07,206 --> 00:41:10,543
you know how I
behave, accept it."

184
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:14,463
That's how it is. Just let
it go and stop being angry.

185
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,715
Let's not argue anymore, okay?

186
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:45,035
Banish, do you hear me?

187
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,831
Now seems like a good
time for you to move on.

188
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:51,834
This situation confuses you even more.

189
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:06,797
Drop it!

190
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,801
Drop it!

191
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:27,860
Give me your weapon!

192
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,447
I've dropped.

193
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:36,452
The backpack.

194
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:39,955
This only I have.

195
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,040
Come on!

196
00:46:45,878 --> 00:46:48,964
Give me the backpack! Come on!

197
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,558
Come on!

198
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:25,250
Fuck!

199
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,170
Bastard!

200
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,352
Fuck!

201
00:47:43,685 --> 00:47:46,730
You shot me, you bastard!

202
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,734
Come on, you have to help me!

203
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,824
Fuck!

204
00:48:02,454 --> 00:48:04,331
Fuck!

205
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:09,837
Wait! You can't
leave me like this!

206
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:11,630
Please help me!

207
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,758
Do not leave me!

208
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:39,885
Help!

209
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:22,678
Please stop!

210
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:57,707
Who are you? Hah?

211
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:01,503
What are you doing here!

212
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:10,095
Jesus?

213
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,602
Isaiah.

214
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:23,024
Is that you, kid?

215
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:54,055
Kid, I thought you'd
never come back.

216
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:57,601
I'm worried about you.

217
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,729
You left without warning.

218
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:04,191
You want to leave me alone?

219
00:54:04,524 --> 00:54:07,110
- Forgive me.
- It's okay, nothing happened, right.

220
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:10,280
Hey, tell me, how's your sister?

221
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,073
Did you see it?

222
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:13,742
Good.

223
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:15,869
Good? Just that?

224
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:17,412
Yes.

225
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:21,166
He asked about you. He is fine.

226
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:24,336
Good. Now you're here.

227
00:54:24,502 --> 00:54:26,755
I thought you'd never come back.

228
00:54:26,922 --> 00:54:27,899
Sorry, dad.

229
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:29,466
It doesn't matter.

230
00:54:29,883 --> 00:54:31,676
Come on, eat.

231
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:34,888
It's still warm.

232
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,850
You're hungry!

233
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:41,770
They don't give you anything.

234
00:54:45,941 --> 00:54:47,192
Drink it.

235
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:51,488
Slow. Don't rush.

236
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,370
You'll get used to it.

237
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:01,373
The water is the same everywhere.

238
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:06,419
What a night you chose to come.

239
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:08,546
Just look at the sky.

240
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:10,590
You're right, my son.

241
00:55:10,757 --> 00:55:16,805
The sky fell, with it all our gods.

242
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:19,182
Asking for something to be done.

243
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:21,726
They are as hungry as we are.

244
00:55:21,893 --> 00:55:24,396
- I don't understand.
- You remember that,

245
00:55:24,562 --> 00:55:26,481
How did you pray when you were little?

246
00:55:26,648 --> 00:55:29,234
You scream, "They're
coming, they're coming!"

247
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:33,989
But in the end there is
nothing special about them.

248
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:39,119
You used to live in luxury and
now you're crawling on the ground.

249
00:55:39,744 --> 00:55:44,249
You're mortal, we make
you do something special,

250
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,168
but out of necessity.

251
00:55:47,335 --> 00:55:51,172
Previously we didn't
know how to find ourselves.

252
00:55:51,673 --> 00:55:54,134
But you need us.

253
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:58,596
You want us to believe you.

254
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:01,433
The sky is falling because of us now.

255
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,518
Do you think we'll need you?

256
00:56:03,685 --> 00:56:08,648
Each of us finds what
we need within ourselves.

257
00:56:08,982 --> 00:56:12,777
We live in Eden! They took him!

258
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:18,283
When you find a janitor, you
can ask him what you want.

259
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:20,577
And you're fulfilled?

260
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,621
Depends on what makes life.

261
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:27,083
Whether it's your
dream or your nightmare.

262
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,418
Yourself.

263
00:56:32,047 --> 00:56:34,591
I found this under the bridge.

264
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:37,677
I'm having trouble reaching it.

265
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:40,889
I almost lost a leg.

266
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:44,476
You don't know
how hard it is to fight.

267
00:56:44,642 --> 00:56:45,935
Look!

268
00:56:49,898 --> 00:56:53,943
- It's worth it!
- What do I care about money!

269
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,864
- What is the point?
- This makes me happy!

270
00:56:58,656 --> 00:57:00,992
Do you want to feel it?

271
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:09,793
Your sister knows.

272
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,795
That's why he left.

273
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,505
He goes with them.

274
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:15,965
And now I'm a grandfather!

275
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,428
Singer grandfather from heaven.

276
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,180
What's his name?

277
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:23,574
Who?

278
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:25,141
Your daughter.

279
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:28,186
I will take you.

280
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:37,792
Demian!

281
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:40,086
Demian, are you there?

282
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:45,341
Yes I'm here. What is it?

283
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:49,512
Hear. I'm in one place.

284
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,598
A workshop, I don't know.

285
01:00:51,764 --> 01:00:54,017
I found the battery.

286
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:58,771
Is it true?
Have you tried it? Can?

287
01:00:59,063 --> 01:01:01,816
I've tried it.

288
01:01:02,483 --> 01:01:04,569
Still have some burdens.

289
01:01:04,736 --> 01:01:08,740
I'll take it to the car
and we'll see if it starts.

290
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:11,451
Don't rely too much on it.

291
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,871
But hey, what do you have to lose?

292
01:01:15,663 --> 01:01:17,290
There isn't any.

293
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:22,920
Where are you now?

294
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:25,214
Are you close?

295
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:27,550
I'm very close to the warehouse.

296
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,219
But I'll go the other way.

297
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,473
We can meet in the car.

298
01:01:34,932 --> 01:01:36,225
Okay.

299
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:40,980
Go to the south side.

300
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:43,650
There's a back door there.

301
01:01:44,359 --> 01:01:47,862
Go out, then go right, there is a dark alley.

302
01:01:48,029 --> 01:01:50,740
Then go straight for 50 meters.

303
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,576
There you will find the car.

304
01:01:53,993 --> 01:01:56,537
Good guy, change and you're done.

305
01:08:44,111 --> 01:08:46,739
Banish. That's you, isn't it?

306
01:09:17,978 --> 01:09:20,272
The acid is leaking.

307
01:09:20,564 --> 01:09:22,775
This won't work.

308
01:09:27,905 --> 01:09:30,324
Sorry friend.

309
01:09:50,594 --> 01:09:53,139
IT IS NOT SAFE TO STAY HERE.

310
01:09:57,643 --> 01:10:00,437
There is a way out.

311
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:04,650
This won't be easy.

312
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:07,987
But you have to prove
to me you're worthy.

313
01:10:15,369 --> 01:10:18,372
If you're ready, let's go now.

314
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:22,770
From here, straight forward.

315
01:11:22,937 --> 01:11:24,730
500 meters.

316
01:11:24,897 --> 01:11:27,024
Then you go left.

317
01:11:27,191 --> 01:11:29,026
You will see some grassy areas.

318
01:11:29,193 --> 01:11:32,029
Go straight towards the forest.

319
01:11:34,865 --> 01:11:35,950
Go.

320
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,994
Trust me, okay?

321
01:11:40,037 --> 01:11:45,125
I'll take the other tunnel.
This is my way of distracting you.

322
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,714
If you see us together, it
will be easier to catch us.

323
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:12,653
See you at the exit.

324
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:45,902
Help!

325
01:17:53,285 --> 01:17:56,288
Help!

326
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:27,295
Help me!

327
01:19:29,423 --> 01:19:32,426
Help!

328
01:19:58,618 --> 01:20:01,138
If we are lucky, we
might catch a rabbit.

329
01:20:01,288 --> 01:20:03,665
We might catch a rabbit.

330
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:06,293
Have you ever eaten this?

331
01:20:07,586 --> 01:20:09,129
No.

332
01:20:10,547 --> 01:20:12,716
You're really funny.

333
01:20:12,883 --> 01:20:15,135
The water in my mouth ran out.

334
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:17,971
I haven't eaten anything for a long time.

335
01:20:18,138 --> 01:20:21,767
Maybe we'll catch
one and cook it.

336
01:20:23,727 --> 01:20:26,271
Wait a minute, I want to pee.

337
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:41,012
Let's go, buddy. Come on.

338
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:47,227
Let's get out of here.

339
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,428
Why are you called Banen?

340
01:24:32,058 --> 01:24:34,811
It's a nickname, you say.

341
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:42,736
When I was little I often
read science fiction comics.

342
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,491
There's a character named Brian Bannen.

343
01:24:52,078 --> 01:24:56,124
My father always called me Bannen.

344
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:00,170
And you make it a habit?

345
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:07,260
I always feel like
I'm someone else.

346
01:25:17,937 --> 01:25:19,898
And who are you?

347
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:33,036
Vaña" "Aguará Guazu".

348
01:25:33,703 --> 01:25:38,208
A type of long-legged
fox that lives in swamps.

349
01:25:39,584 --> 01:25:42,587
But this one has something special.

350
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:45,924
Do you know which one?

351
01:25:46,424 --> 01:25:49,761
He wants to be human.

352
01:25:51,805 --> 01:25:54,307
He talked about almost all the animals.

353
01:25:54,474 --> 01:25:58,103
Alligators, tapirs, birds.

354
01:25:58,269 --> 01:26:01,898
“I want to be human,
I want to be human.”

355
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:07,195
Everyone looked at
him as if he was crazy.

356
01:26:07,403 --> 01:26:09,072
That's not possible.

357
01:26:09,781 --> 01:26:12,760
A sparrow flying by heard him.

358
01:26:12,784 --> 01:26:15,370
He said, "I can help you."

359
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:19,707
"I know someone, a
wizard, who can help you."

360
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:20,959
"Where does he live?"

361
01:26:21,126 --> 01:26:24,129
"In a shack at the
end of the road here."

362
01:26:24,295 --> 01:26:26,089
"Good, good!"

363
01:26:26,256 --> 01:26:28,550
So he ran.

364
01:26:29,008 --> 01:26:35,324
And when he arrived, he stood in the hut.
And inside it is Aivaguá.

365
01:26:35,348 --> 01:26:37,767
The witch's name, Aivaguá.

366
01:26:37,976 --> 01:26:39,853
He is cooking something.

367
01:26:40,019 --> 01:26:43,857
When he reached
the door, he slipped in.

368
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:46,693
Aivaguá looked at him.

369
01:26:47,318 --> 01:26:51,322
He said, “you told
me you could help me.

370
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:54,242
"I want to be human."

371
01:26:55,285 --> 01:26:59,622
And he tells her, “but
it comes at a price.”

372
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:02,250
"Will it work?" he asked.

373
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:08,673
- "Your ears!"
- "no, my ears are very beautiful!

374
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,925
I can't just give it to you!"

375
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,594
"Your feet!"

376
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,864
"No, I can't give you my feet."

377
01:27:14,888 --> 01:27:19,601
I'm the only animal in the
swamp with long legs, the only one!

378
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:21,102
"Your fur!"

379
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:25,982
"No! No! No! I won't give you my
feathers! Not my beautiful feathers!"

380
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:29,027
So the witch asked
him further, and he

381
01:27:29,194 --> 01:27:32,238
refused. Everything!
He rejected them all.

382
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:37,118
Finally Aivaguá
got tired and said:

383
01:27:38,036 --> 01:27:41,164
“You really want to be human?”

384
01:27:41,915 --> 01:27:46,020
He said, "Yes! I
want to be human",

385
01:27:46,044 --> 01:27:49,756
but I can't give you
what you ask for!

386
01:27:50,423 --> 01:27:52,508
"I can't!"

387
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,031
The witch looked at him like

388
01:27:57,055 --> 01:27:59,974
that, intently, for
a few moments.

389
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:06,564
He said, "If you can't
sacrifice what hurts you",

390
01:28:07,398 --> 01:28:11,319
just for convenience,
then I'm very sorry.

391
01:28:11,945 --> 01:28:15,782
I ask you never to
ask for my help again.

392
01:28:18,534 --> 01:28:20,745
And something else:

393
01:28:21,204 --> 01:28:26,042
You will continue to
dream of being human.

394
01:28:26,793 --> 01:28:29,337
"And this is how you die."

395
01:28:36,928 --> 01:28:39,347
"And this is how you die."

396
01:28:43,935 --> 01:28:45,937
And you?

397
01:28:46,271 --> 01:28:48,856
Have you sacrificed much?

398
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,988
This is strange.

399
01:28:57,323 --> 01:28:59,909
I have memories, but...

400
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:03,788
I know I've never lived it.

401
01:29:09,002 --> 01:29:11,421
You don't have a weapon?

402
01:29:13,089 --> 01:29:15,174
Could I see it?

403
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,169
Victor.

404
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:54,047
I don't know if you got
a reception, but I left this

405
01:29:54,213 --> 01:29:58,092
message for you in case
you get one someday.

406
01:29:58,551 --> 01:30:00,803
There is nothing left.

407
01:30:01,346 --> 01:30:04,640
I don't know how
much longer we can last.

408
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:07,226
I hope.

409
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:09,937
You are okay.

410
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:13,483
You find peace.

411
01:30:13,858 --> 01:30:15,693
I really love you.

412
01:37:33,798 --> 01:37:35,841
I apologize.

413
01:37:37,301 --> 01:37:40,429
I have to find out
who you really are.

414
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:48,521
I have to get you out of there.

415
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:52,733
You.

416
01:37:55,152 --> 01:37:57,780
You...

417
01:37:59,657 --> 01:38:03,994
You're a parasite.

418
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:14,964
How about you?

419
01:38:16,257 --> 01:38:17,967
Who are you?

420
01:38:21,512 --> 01:38:25,182
I like things the way
they are right now.

421
01:38:27,476 --> 01:38:32,273
I have this place.

422
01:38:34,567 --> 01:38:40,155
I went out to plant seeds.

423
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:50,916
And you?

424
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,960
Do you know who you are?

425
01:38:53,127 --> 01:38:55,838
I always know who I am!

426
01:38:57,006 --> 01:38:59,550
I accept it!

427
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:40,841
May I ask for your help?

428
01:39:42,051 --> 01:39:43,677
What?

429
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:47,848
Will you give me one?

430
01:41:30,117 --> 01:41:33,245
My darling, where are you?
Are you lost?

431
01:41:33,537 --> 01:41:37,624
Come on, we're all here,
at your father's house.

432
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,626
All your friends are here.

433
01:41:39,793 --> 01:41:42,671
Come on, your father really
misses you, and your son too.
