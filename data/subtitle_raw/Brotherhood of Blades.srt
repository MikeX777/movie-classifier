1
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:01,501
During the 1620s, Wei Zhongxian, Head Eunuch
and Head of the Imperial Assassins...

2
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,107
had been having his way in the Imperial
Court for eight years.

3
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:06,876
At that time, seven out of ten
Court Officials...

4
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,959
were Wei's followers,
known as "the Eunuch's Clique".

5
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,584
When Emperor Chongzhen came into power,

6
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:16,459
he relieved Wei of all duties and sent
him to the remote outpost of Fengyang.

7
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:19,876
Although Wei had fallen,
the Clique was still there.

8
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:23,209
Chongzhen wanted every member of
the Clique arrested.

9
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,459
It sure is cold, Master Ma.

10
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,417
A nice bowl of noodles would warm us up,

11
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,584
wouldn't it?

12
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,209
Noodles...

13
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:33,084
at this hour,

14
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,917
only two kinds of people are outside...

15
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,376
besides the night watchmen.

16
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,292
There's us,

17
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:41,459
sent by rotten luck...

18
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,501
to patrol the grounds.

19
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:46,334
And then there's...

20
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:50,542
What did you see?

21
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:56,084
Get out of there.

22
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:08,334
An Imperial Assassin!

23
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,667
What's wrong?

24
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:12,626
Lets get out of here. Come.

25
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:20,834
"The Imperial assassins are arresting
the Eunuch Clique member Xu Xianchun."

26
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,292
5 o'clock... remember 5 o'clock.

27
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,001
Take Xianchun with you to Xizhimen,

28
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,531
and take this letter to Sir Cao.

29
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,102
You will leave the city in the water cart.

30
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,126
I'll remember that.

31
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,917
What is all this?
Why aren't you dressed properly?

32
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,876
Sister-in-law, what's the matter?

33
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,251
Sir Chen!

34
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,501
I'm from the North Zhenfu Division.

35
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,084
My name is Shen Lian.

36
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,417
- Please don't be alarmed.
- I'm not alarmed!

37
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,376
Sir Shen, even Imperial Assassins...

38
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:05,876
need an explanation...

39
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:07,667
for storming my residence.

40
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,084
You know perfectly well...

41
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,876
why I'm here!

42
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:59,251
Sir Chen, he only has one arm left.

43
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,501
Do you want him to keep it?

44
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,751
You know what I want.

45
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,417
Arrest me then.

46
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,459
I know your methods!

47
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,417
I can handle the tortures.

48
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,917
Leave my daughter alone... she's only 14!

49
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:37,292
Leave my daughter alone, she's only 14!

50
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,542
If she ends up as a
courtesan at the Academy,

51
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,167
it will be because...
you harbored a member of the Clique.

52
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,292
Where is Xu Xianchun? Tell me...

53
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,792
and I'll leave.

54
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,542
Never to return!

55
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,459
Sir

56
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,042
Go!

57
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,667
Sir Chen, if you do me a favor...

58
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,501
no one in your family gets hurt!

59
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:55,792
Sir Xu...

60
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,834
please come with us.

61
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,251
Run Sir. We'll take care of him.

62
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,459
Lui Jianxing, I know why
you're doing this...

63
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,084
It's because I didn't promote you
to the rank of Baihu.

64
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,584
Lui Jianxing, let me go!

65
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:18,792
If you do, I promise I'll promote you.

66
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,084
- Lian!
- Yichuan.

67
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,834
Even Wei Zhongxian is down,

68
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,959
and this ex-Commander is still
so high and mighty.

69
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:36,542
Jianxing... the roots
of the Clique run deep!

70
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,667
Those bastards higher up...

71
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,334
only remember the three of us...

72
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:43,224
when there is a tricky mission like this.

73
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,417
You're right, but I'm
afraid it's just our lot...

74
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,876
to deal with this kind of business.

75
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,042
Hey, Lian...

76
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:02,876
Listen...

77
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:09,792
I get it.

78
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,167
Yichuan...

79
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,607
you can not go on like this forever.

80
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,834
My good sir, it's getting late.

81
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,376
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

82
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,626
You bitch. How dare you disrespect me!

83
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,709
Even if I have to pay double the price...

84
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,834
I will still bed Zhou Miaotong today!

85
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:45,834
Come to bed.

86
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,542
I have to go to work soon.

87
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,459
You're an interesting character.

88
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,584
Of all our customers...

89
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,209
you're the only one who pays...

90
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,626
but doesn't come to bed.

91
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,501
I'm happy to sit here.

92
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:17,376
Of all the houses... I
picked yours tonight.

93
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:21,292
Have that Zhou girl cleaned up and see me.

94
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,417
As soon as I've saved enough,
I'll buy your freedom!

95
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,459
Please, Mr. Officer...

96
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,292
with your salary?

97
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,126
You're joking!

98
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,792
Besides, this is the
brothel of the Academy.

99
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,167
Without an official permission...

100
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,209
no one gets out!

101
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,626
Sir Chen, I need a favor.

102
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,126
I need you...

103
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:53,459
to help me release a
courtesan from the Academy.

104
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,792
It's morning already. I have to go.

105
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,001
Next time, don't bother to change.

106
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,209
I thought you might not like the uniform.

107
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,876
Everybody here knows...

108
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,792
that you're Sir Shen of
the Imperial Assassins.

109
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,459
Xiu!

110
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:06,417
What's the matter?

111
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,001
Afraid your officer friends might see me?

112
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:15,917
Don't worry, they're far away.

113
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,917
Xiu,

114
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:19,959
just take this...

115
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:21,584
and go!

116
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,792
It's better then nothing.

117
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,667
This is the last time,
I don't want to see you again.

118
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,001
You think this uniform turns you into
a respectable person?

119
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,626
A thief will always be a thief.

120
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,501
This secret of yours...

121
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,501
will keep me well-fed forever.

122
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,251
Think I'm bluffing?

123
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:56,917
I'll give you three days...
to get together 100 silver taels.

124
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,709
100 taels...

125
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,084
I make 20 taels a year.

126
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,667
Where would I get a 100?

127
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:07,376
Go peddle your ass.

128
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:11,084
Quite a few high officials...
who have a thing for pretty boys.

129
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:12,667
With your looks,

130
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,334
100 taels... would be a piece of cake.

131
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,626
Trying to kill me again?

132
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,542
I don't see what's so special about you...

133
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,792
that made Master favor you over me.

134
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:52,834
Three days...

135
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:09,876
- Sir.
- Lui Jianxing, you're quite an early bird.

136
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:12,834
I spent the night here
after work yesterday.

137
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,542
And Sir Xui...

138
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:18,459
Xui Xianchun is under custody?

139
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,084
Yes!

140
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,291
This is really thanks to your careful
planning, Sir.

141
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:26,542
All the credit should go to you...
as I wrote in my report.

142
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:27,751
Very well.

143
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,876
It's to early for any work.

144
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,334
Go get some rest.

145
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,376
- Anything else?
- Well...

146
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,042
actually we talked about it already.

147
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,376
It's about my promotion.

148
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:46,126
I knew you wouldn't be here for no reason!

149
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:47,894
I still haven't heard back from anyone.

150
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,167
Sir... I gave you silver for the bribes.

151
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,185
I even gave you credit for last night!

152
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,584
Lui Jianxing, you have some bloody nerve!

153
00:13:57,126 --> 00:14:00,251
In that case, I want none of your credit...

154
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,833
and you can stop pestering me
about this promotion.

155
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,126
Sir!

156
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:08,917
Apologies, sir.
I meant no offense. Please forgive me.

157
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,792
It's just that my mother keeps asking...

158
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,435
when I'll take over my father's position.

159
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,667
That's enough!

160
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,459
The silver you gave me...

161
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,501
only goes as far as Sir Qianhu.

162
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:20,084
Everyone needs to be bribed.

163
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:24,459
Either... bring me more silver,

164
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,376
or...

165
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,001
learn to be patient.

166
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:46,917
- Sir Zhao,
- Sir Zhao...

167
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,251
Which one is Lui Jianxing?

168
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,626
Do you know when Wei Zhongxian
left the city?

169
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,334
Your Excellency,
the day before yesterday.

170
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:06,876
If you leave now,

171
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,042
when can you catch up with him?

172
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:14,834
If the horses are fast,
in Fucheng County by midnight.

173
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:21,876
Good. You three, go do that!

174
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:25,501
Your Excellency?

175
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,459
His Majesty wants Wei Zhongxian dead.

176
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,834
Your Excellency,

177
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,751
why the three of us?

178
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,959
Look at how shabby you are.

179
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,057
There's no way you're part of the Clique.

180
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,001
Sir, Fucheng County is right ahead.

181
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,584
Once we're inside guard the four gates.

182
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,251
No one gets in or out.

183
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,459
Split into teams.
Inspect all Inns, big or small.

184
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:04,709
Get out!

185
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,376
How dare you throw us out!

186
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,501
Wei Zhongxian must be inside that Inn.

187
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,751
Don't send out the signal.

188
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,501
There's no way the three of us...

189
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,126
can handle this on our own!

190
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,584
With us three getting this mission...

191
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,709
plenty of people must be jealous.

192
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,417
Zhang Ying is not happy either.

193
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,876
He might have placed moles among our men.

194
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,667
If he wants to jeopardize this mission!

195
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,751
Even our lives are at risk!

196
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,584
Are you trying to make sure...

197
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,309
that we get all the credit for this one?

198
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,459
Think it through, I mean it!

199
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:55,167
Lian... are you not fed up with this life?

200
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,685
We have no silver and no connections.

201
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,501
What we need is an opportunity,
an opportunity...

202
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,751
to get on top!

203
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,792
Yichuan, what do you think?

204
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,709
You lowlives have got some guts...

205
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,834
making a scene here.

206
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,001
- Kill them.
- Lady...

207
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:39,292
they're Imperial Assassins!

208
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:41,501
Only three of them,
nothing to be scared of.

209
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:44,542
For each head... you get 10 taels of gold.

210
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,042
Give it a try!

211
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,126
Kill them.

212
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:06,334
Block the gate!

213
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,167
- Get upstairs!
- Okay.

214
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,792
Sir Wei...

215
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:37,834
Officer... even if you cut off my head,

216
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,751
you still have plenty to deal with.

217
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:45,001
What kind of trouble...
could you possibly have?

218
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:50,084
Why does that boy Chongzhan
want to kill me?

219
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,542
Is it because I deserve to die?

220
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,376
You underestimate His majesty.

221
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:05,376
I was in power for eight years.

222
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,126
Now, my power is gone.

223
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:10,209
All that I have left is lots of money.

224
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,167
Bandits and Manchurians
are harassing the borders.

225
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:14,852
What His Majesty needs is a fortune...

226
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:18,501
to fund his armies... and
he has his eyes on mine!

227
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:22,376
If you don't bring him my money,
your trouble's only starting.

228
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,959
If we kill you,

229
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,292
we'll certainly bring back your money.

230
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,584
It isn't here.

231
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:54,834
400 taels of gold.

232
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:01,209
Open the door.

233
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:19,917
How much do you make a year?

234
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,876
A handful of this is worth...

235
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,501
30 years of your salary.

236
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,167
Let me live, and it's all yours.

237
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,334
This money will get me killed.

238
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,126
If you kill me...

239
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,709
my followers will hunt you down one by one.

240
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:37,167
Don't even dream of saving your skins.

241
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:39,001
This money here...

242
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,626
take it and you die.

243
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:42,876
Don't take it, you die as well.

244
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,959
Why don't you take a change...

245
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:46,417
Sir Shen!

246
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:50,917
You know me?

247
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,001
I was head of the Secret Police,

248
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,126
we kept an eye on everyone!

249
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,834
From the commanders to the petty officers.

250
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,959
I know every one of you.

251
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,001
Go, kill them.

252
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:16,459
Make a deal with me,
and I'll tell you where the money is.

253
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,626
Bring it back, and your
mission will be a success.

254
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:20,501
Lian! Lian!

255
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,876
Jianxing, watch out!

256
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,126
Make up your mind.

257
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:27,376
Or your two friends want last much longer.

258
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:31,501
This... all yours... all yours...

259
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,084
Who sent you?

260
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,584
He's nothing but a pawn,

261
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,542
just like you.

262
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,876
- Lady, it's on fire upstairs.
- Go upstairs!

263
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,584
Wei Zhongxian is dead.

264
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,084
The Eunuch is dead, drop your weapons!

265
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,209
Your Excellency.

266
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,518
Let me introduce the new Grand
Secretary of Cabinet.

267
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:40,792
Sir Han Kuang.

268
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,417
Greet him.

269
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:44,667
Sir Han.

270
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,709
So this is... Wei the Eunuch?

271
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,209
- Yes, sir.
- Open it.

272
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,626
It's so badly burnt.
How do I know it's really him?

273
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:11,209
Here is his tablet.

274
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,251
- How did he die?
- He set himself on fire.

275
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:23,959
- Did you see him do it with your own eyes?
- Yes.

276
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,917
Then why didn't you stop him?

277
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:32,834
His Majesty wants the Eunuch himself,

278
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,542
and you brought back a pile of ashes.

279
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:38,792
This tablet is no evidence
enough that it's him!

280
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:41,792
You don't even convince me,
let alone His Majesty.

281
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,709
Sir Han,

282
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,834
what are you saying?

283
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:47,667
You think...

284
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,501
these three Imperial Assassins...

285
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:52,042
brought back the corpse of someone else?

286
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,001
Sir, we would never dare.

287
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,209
If you ask me, this is Wei himself.

288
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:17,042
Dozens of Assassins saw
him burning to death.

289
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,876
Who would have the guts...

290
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,626
to play tricks under everyone's nose?

291
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,501
It would have been suicidal.

292
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,584
Sir Zhao,

293
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,584
His Majesty is young...

294
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:31,209
but very shrewd.

295
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:32,959
When you're at His service,

296
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,334
better be extra careful.

297
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,917
If anything goes wrong, we all go down.

298
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:42,626
Yes, Sir! You're right, Sir Han.

299
00:26:43,376 --> 00:26:45,792
Thank you for standing up for us.

300
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,501
We're more then grateful.

301
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:50,209
It's fine, go get some rest.

302
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:53,126
Good job, I'll put in a good word for you.

303
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:55,501
Thank you, your Excellency.

304
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,292
But next time you see Sir Han,

305
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,876
don't be so presumptuous.

306
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,542
You know very well...

307
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,501
whether you really saw Wei or not.

308
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,042
Let's go.

309
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:14,042
Your lungs are straining.

310
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,042
There's blood in your phlegm.

311
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:19,917
Your skin is dry and your pulse is weak.

312
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,459
Master Jin...

313
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:23,501
how is your sleep?

314
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,667
- Master Jin...
- What?

315
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:37,042
I'm asking about your sleep.

316
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,126
- I sweat a lot.
- I thought so.

317
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,376
Just a second, Master Jin.

318
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,001
I'll write you a prescription.

319
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,167
My name is Jin. Jin Ychuan.

320
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,542
I know that.

321
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:01,917
Sweetie, if you're done
with all the work...

322
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:03,376
come back in here.

323
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,459
Okay.

324
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,251
- What is this?
- Musk, cloves, sandalwood...

325
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:18,619
and borneol wrapped together.

326
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:20,167
Keep it on you.

327
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:21,876
It will help with your cough.

328
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,501
- Thank you.
- My name is Zhang Yan.

329
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,167
Don't tell my father.

330
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,709
He doesn't like it when I write
my own prescriptions.

331
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:34,709
- Yichuan...
- Okay!

332
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,084
Wei Ting, you've got some nerve.

333
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,810
The entire country is hunting down
members of the Clique,

334
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,626
and you dare return to the Capital.

335
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:21,584
Jingzhong,

336
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:24,876
look at how you veil your accusations.

337
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:28,626
I see you've grown subtle.

338
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:32,876
Godfather...

339
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,959
you're unharmed!

340
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:37,126
I'm not dead,

341
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,126
and yet you don't seem surprised.

342
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,709
When I saw the corpse,
I knew it wasn't you.

343
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:45,959
So of course I'm not surprised.

344
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,042
How are things at the Secret Police?

345
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,042
His Majesty is having all documents...

346
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,417
at the Secret Service examined.

347
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:02,917
I think... he plans to close it up.

348
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:07,709
The Secret Police
has existed for almost 200 years.

349
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,667
I didn't think it would end with my reign.

350
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,459
You're heading the Secret
Police now, aren't you?

351
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,542
You know everything.

352
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,959
His Majesty... just appointed me.

353
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,376
- Special passes.
- Yes.

354
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,417
You would need them on your way.

355
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,709
You want to get rid of me.

356
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:33,501
That's not what I meant!

357
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:45,501
You recognized that corpse, didn't you?

358
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,001
It was my servant.

359
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:49,751
Ting found out that...

360
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,667
his family name was also Zhao,

361
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,751
and that you're from the same town.

362
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,001
Godfather...

363
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:00,542
your men are no match for me.

364
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,209
If a fight starts...

365
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,251
we both lose.

366
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:14,542
Don't you want to kill me?

367
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,876
I thought you'd be more reckless.

368
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,001
My son...

369
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,501
you want to kill me...

370
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:33,667
because you don't want to get
dragged into this.

371
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,542
Am I right?

372
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:41,959
That Imperial Assassin knows I'm alive.

373
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,834
Kill him for me.

374
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:47,667
Godfather...

375
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,751
that Han Kuang is already suspicious.
If we act now...

376
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,542
I'm afraid he'll leave no stone unturned.

377
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:56,084
Kill Shen Lian,

378
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,042
and I'll disappear.

379
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:04,834
Only then,

380
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:07,834
will you be truly safe.

381
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,167
Miaotong...

382
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:39,417
with this money...

383
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,709
I can buy your freedom.

384
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,292
We'll go to Suzhou,

385
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:49,209
and you can have whatever you like.

386
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,542
What do you say?

387
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:03,959
Miaotong... hurry.

388
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,917
Sir Shen has been waiting down there.

389
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,292
Madame, please offer him a few more drinks.

390
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,709
My treat.

391
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:13,876
Miaotong...

392
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:17,417
Why are you still here?

393
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:21,251
I have... a visitor.

394
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,667
I can't bear to leave you.

395
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,167
Whatever visitor that is,
I'll ask him to leave.

396
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:32,417
That won't do, he's an Imperial Assassin.

397
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,001
I hate their bunch...

398
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:36,834
wearing Spring Blades
bestowed by His Majesty,

399
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:39,334
but always with innocent
blood on their hands.

400
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,167
This one's different.

401
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,001
He says he will...

402
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,292
buy me freedom.

403
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:50,209
- You care about him.
- No, silly.

404
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:52,792
I'm not taking his money.

405
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,792
I only wish...

406
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,959
it was you who bought me freedom.

407
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:00,792
Miaotong, I've almost saved enough...

408
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,792
to take you away from here very soon.

409
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,042
We'll go somewhere beautiful...

410
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,542
and spend our life there.

411
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,126
You two are really too much.

412
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,834
Why are you still here?

413
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,584
Madame Xue, I did pay you for this.

414
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:41,042
But...

415
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,042
Alright.

416
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,001
You should go.

417
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,626
Miaotong, Sir Shen is gone!

418
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:01,959
Miaotong, Sir Shen must never find
out about you and young Master Yan.

419
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,917
You don't want to displease...

420
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,001
an Imperial Assassin.

421
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:15,709
Yichuan, try it on.

422
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:22,542
Thank you.

423
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:26,126
Lian is here.

424
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,792
Lian.

425
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:33,292
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

426
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:39,292
Did you go see Miss Zhou?

427
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:49,584
Yichuan, that pretty thing you
have on your belt,

428
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:51,251
where did you get it?

429
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:53,459
Come on, Lian.

430
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,834
You were there, weren't you?

431
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,917
You little bastard, tell me.

432
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:00,917
Do you fancy the doctor's daughter?

433
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,542
You went to see the doctor?

434
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:03,834
What for?

435
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,001
Watch out!

436
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:36,834
Who were they?

437
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,209
Hard to tell.

438
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:40,917
Even on our way back here...

439
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:42,501
we were being followed.

440
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,209
We should all watch out.

441
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:47,876
Maybe someone from the Clique
wants to avenge Wei.

442
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:52,542
If so... we can't stay in the capital.

443
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,626
They see us but we don't see them.

444
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,292
Jianxing, why don't we ask our superior...

445
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,292
to transfer us to Nanjing?

446
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:03,792
Nanjing?

447
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:07,584
Lian, I've never seen you scared.

448
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,042
What's wrong this time?

449
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:11,917
Jianxing,

450
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,001
for once, listen to me. Alright?

451
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,542
Wei Zhongxian...

452
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:20,042
- set himself on fire?
- Yes.

453
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:21,292
He set himself on fire.

454
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,209
If you leave...

455
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,167
what about Miss Zhou?

456
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:27,834
I'll find a way to bring her along.

457
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,376
You know very well...

458
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,251
whether you saw Wei or not.

459
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:36,209
I say...

460
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:38,459
let's stay put, and see how it goes.

461
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:39,876
What do you think?

462
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,599
- I'll do whatever you two decide.
- Good.

463
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,584
- Jianxing...
- Stop it.

464
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:11,167
I told you not to act on your own!

465
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,334
If it weren't for me...

466
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,084
they would have caught you.

467
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,709
Don't expect me to be grateful.

468
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:19,251
Godfather told you...

469
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,417
to do it as soon as possible.

470
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,542
I have my plans.

471
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:33,667
Do you know about Yan Peiwei?

472
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:36,251
He's the Commander
of the Imperial Court of Censors.

473
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:38,251
Correct!

474
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:40,642
He's also a member of the Golden Swords.

475
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,001
Imperial Assassins... today...

476
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:45,749
you are to arrest members of the
Clique listed here!

477
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,417
He commands several dozen followers,

478
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,501
all highly skilled fighters.

479
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,417
- Lui Jianxing!
- Yes, Sir.

480
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,459
- Shen Lian!
- Yes, Sir.

481
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:55,917
You two come with me.

482
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,292
We're going to Yan Peiwei's residence.

483
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:01,584
When you kill,

484
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:06,042
it's essential not to leave any traces.

485
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,387
Commander, we have been waiting
a long time.

486
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,626
Shall we force our way in?

487
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:16,209
We're coming for Yan Peiwei alone.

488
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,042
Why storm the residence?
Is it a massacre you want?

489
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:23,334
Any volunteers to go get him?

490
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,292
Jianxing...

491
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:27,376
something is not right!

492
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:29,292
Don't go!

493
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:31,417
What are you scared of?

494
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:35,792
Are the Golden Swords that scary?

495
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,459
Who would have the guts...

496
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,959
to resist Imperial Assassins?

497
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,667
I have orders.

498
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,792
Whoever captures Yan Peiwei...

499
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,376
will be promoted.

500
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:51,834
Lui Jianxing...

501
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,209
wouldn't you...

502
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,876
like this credit?

503
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:06,667
You two don't have to go.

504
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:08,501
I'll go by myself.

505
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:26,167
Sir, how can I help you?

506
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:28,584
I am Garrison Officer Lui Jianxing.

507
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,376
I'm here to see Sir Yan.

508
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:32,584
I am Yan Junbin, son of Yan Peiwei.

509
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,709
My father is not well,

510
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,477
and does not want to receive visitors.

511
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:41,459
I have Division orders,
to bring Sir Yan in for questioning.

512
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:43,209
This is the mandate.

513
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,001
Young Master Yan,
it's better to let me in...

514
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:49,334
instead of having the Baihu Commander
killing his way in!

515
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,084
What do you say?

516
00:40:55,126 --> 00:40:58,126
Alright... please follow me.

517
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:19,737
Having Imperial Assassins here...

518
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,084
makes them nervous!

519
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,792
Please don't be offended.

520
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:28,209
Father...

521
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,417
Junbin, what are you doing?

522
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,084
Father, I read the mandate.

523
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:41,852
They're framing you to be
a member of the Clique.

524
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:42,709
So what?

525
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,435
Even if I have to go to the highest court,

526
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:45,584
I'm still innocent.

527
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:47,042
What do I have to be scared of?

528
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:49,935
Once you're in the Imperial Prison,
they will torture a confession out of you.

529
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,626
Why don't we tie up these Assassins...

530
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,417
- and make a run for it?
- Shut up!

531
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:56,501
- What you suggest is rebellion!
- Father!

532
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,501
Sir Yan, we know you're not
a member of the Clique.

533
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:02,266
It must be some kind of misunderstanding.

534
00:42:02,376 --> 00:42:04,792
I'm sure the judges will clear your name.

535
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:06,292
I do hope that...

536
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,626
you can come with us.

537
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:11,959
I'll come with you, but can you...

538
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:14,251
- leave my family alone?
- Father!

539
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:16,876
By all means.

540
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:20,292
I won't be long.

541
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,084
Father!

542
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:27,751
Father!

543
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,209
Kill them!

544
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:40,542
Send the signal!

545
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:47,959
Commander, the fight seems to
have started. Are we going in?

546
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,126
Are you telling me what to do?

547
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:56,876
I would never.

548
00:42:58,126 --> 00:43:00,834
No one goes in! Seal off the gate.

549
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,751
Don't let any Clique member get out!

550
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,417
Wait till it dies down inside.

551
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,209
Open the gate!

552
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:22,376
Friends! Open the gate!

553
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:34,501
Jianxing, the gate is sealed!

554
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:42,667
Everybody, stop!

555
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:06,792
Lian!

556
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:10,459
Jianxing!

557
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:17,751
- Yichuan...
- I'm here!

558
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:18,834
- Lian...
- I'm here to!

559
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:20,001
Let's finish this!

560
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:22,084
And go get drunk.

561
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:26,084
Arrows!

562
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,417
Arrows!

563
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:54,417
Your tea, Your Excellency.

564
00:46:27,126 --> 00:46:28,542
What exactly...

565
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:32,292
did we do?

566
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,001
Why are there no sounds?

567
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:53,542
Open the gate!

568
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:33,167
Your Excellency...
the three of them are coming out!

569
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,751
Shit... Goddamned!

570
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:18,709
Who is it?

571
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:22,084
Who's there?

572
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:40,084
Officer Shen,

573
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,191
are you trying to scare me to death?

574
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:44,292
I wouldn't dare!

575
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:48,792
Especially...
after I almost died myself.

576
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:52,209
It wasn't me!

577
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:55,376
I didn't order for the gate to be sealed!

578
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:58,126
I don't know which bastard gave the order!

579
00:48:58,376 --> 00:49:00,251
I told them... to open the gate.

580
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,626
- Please, it wasn't me!
- I understand.

581
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:05,792
The three of us...

582
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:07,417
took care of Wei Zhongxian.

583
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:10,667
Obviously, the Clique wants us dead.

584
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:14,626
We can't stay in Beijing anymore.

585
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:16,501
Please...

586
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:20,376
transfer us to Nanjing.

587
00:49:28,584 --> 00:49:29,834
300 taels...

588
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:32,626
Sure thing.

589
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,751
Once in Nanjing,

590
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:37,126
Jianxing would be promoted,
I presume.

591
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:38,876
Sure.

592
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:42,709
Shen Lian,

593
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,501
let's put this thing...

594
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:47,959
behind us.

595
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:51,501
Shall we?

596
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:09,376
Sir Shen...
my master asked me to deliver this.

597
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:36,751
Father, have some tea.

598
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,209
Sir Jin, have some tea.

599
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:16,626
It's time. I want the money.

600
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,334
A petty criminal killing an
Imperial Assassin...

601
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,334
and stealing his identity...

602
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:25,001
I'm sure...

603
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:28,376
the police would be interested
in that story.

604
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:36,417
100 taels...

605
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:41,417
And leave Ynchuan alone!

606
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:43,959
Take the money and get lost.

607
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:46,501
Didn't expect
Sir Shen to be so well off.

608
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:51,209
Ding Xiu, I did my homework on you.

609
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:52,792
You're an excellent swordsman,

610
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,126
but you're no match for
an Imperial Assassin.

611
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,626
Thanks.

612
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,667
- So you knew all along?
- Yichuan...

613
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:20,459
we're like brothers.

614
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:22,376
I won't ask you about Ding Xiu.

615
00:52:22,584 --> 00:52:23,751
In return...

616
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:25,584
please don't ask me...

617
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,126
about the money.

618
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:30,292
- Deal?
- Sure.

619
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:35,334
Jianxing...
Sir Han is throwing a dinner party.

620
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:36,959
We're all invited.

621
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,959
Lian, you're hiding something from me.

622
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:46,042
What are you talking about?

623
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,417
Ever since we came back here...

624
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:50,334
I know something is not right.

625
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,001
I've been wondering,
that night at the inn...

626
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:56,626
what really happened?

627
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:00,501
Jianxing... I never betrayed you...

628
00:53:00,626 --> 00:53:01,917
or Yichuan in any way.

629
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:04,376
My conscience is clear.

630
00:53:05,584 --> 00:53:06,709
I trust you.

631
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:16,542
Sir Han is here!

632
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:21,917
Sir Han... Sir Zhao.

633
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:25,251
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

634
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,917
- Officer Liu.
- Your Excellency.

635
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,876
Why are you hiding in the corner? Come.

636
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:36,084
Sit here.

637
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:39,042
Your Excellency, I'm just a lowly officer.

638
00:53:39,501 --> 00:53:42,751
I don't deserve to share
a table with you and Sir Zhao.

639
00:53:43,084 --> 00:53:44,334
Nonsense.

640
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,917
It's your big day today.

641
00:53:47,376 --> 00:53:48,876
You should sit here.

642
00:53:49,084 --> 00:53:51,542
What big day? I don't understand.

643
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:54,626
Officer Liu carried out
His Majesty's orders...

644
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:56,251
and killed Wei Zhongxian.

645
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,126
That's his first feat.

646
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:01,751
Today he came out unscathed
from the Yan residence,

647
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:04,584
and captured Yan Peiwei's son alive.

648
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,334
That's his second feat.

649
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:09,751
Sir Zhenfu Commander,
what were you saying just now?

650
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,334
Your Excellency,

651
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:13,042
Officer Lui should be promoted...

652
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,792
to Baihu Commander.

653
00:54:17,209 --> 00:54:18,209
Bring it over.

654
00:54:21,084 --> 00:54:23,042
Congratulations, Sir Lui.

655
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:27,376
Tomorrow you'll be a level 6 officer
of the Imperial Court.

656
00:54:27,626 --> 00:54:29,542
You are of course qualified for this table.

657
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,876
As you say, Your Excellency.

658
00:54:35,209 --> 00:54:37,084
There was a funny story actually.

659
00:54:37,792 --> 00:54:39,876
Sir Lui was so impatient that...

660
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,667
he gave Zhang Ying 300 taels...

661
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:44,042
to bribe the right people.

662
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:45,876
It was completely unnecessary.

663
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:58,042
Sir Lui...

664
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:14,667
Please don't be offended.

665
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:17,766
There are only good friends here tonight.

666
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:20,417
- Don't be embarrassed.
- Yes.

667
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,042
And don't go to Nanjing.

668
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,307
The Imperial Court needs people like you.

669
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:27,459
The three of you, are better off here.

670
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:29,126
Nanjing?

671
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:31,667
Zhang Ying said you asked to be
transferred to Nanjing.

672
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,334
The food I serve is plain,

673
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:42,459
so I'm showing a performance...

674
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:44,167
to add a little flavor.

675
00:56:08,376 --> 00:56:09,459
By the way, Sir Lui...

676
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:11,334
where did you get the 300 taels...

677
00:56:11,584 --> 00:56:13,001
for bribery?

678
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:23,417
Sir Lui,

679
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:25,584
you killed Wei Zhongxian,

680
00:56:26,126 --> 00:56:28,209
and brought back tons of his treasures.

681
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:32,084
Sometimes Imperial Assassins...

682
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:33,459
keep a little pocket money.

683
00:56:33,626 --> 00:56:35,959
I completely understand.

684
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:38,376
What I'm saying is...

685
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,292
you didn't need to spend that money.

686
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:43,167
The position...

687
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:45,501
would be yours anyway.

688
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,084
In three days we'll perform an autopsy.

689
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:56,251
If we prove the body is really Wei's,

690
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,084
His Majesty will announce to the world...

691
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:02,626
that... the Clique has fallen.

692
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:08,251
And now... let's drink up.

693
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:25,709
Sir...

694
00:57:29,209 --> 00:57:30,667
with the condition it's in...

695
00:57:31,459 --> 00:57:33,059
it's still possible to examine the body?

696
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,042
Wei drank elixir for so many years...

697
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:41,001
that we can still find it in his bones.

698
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:44,584
This inspection is merely a formality.

699
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,001
No need to worry.

700
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,501
You're right.

701
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:56,417
Sir Lui,

702
00:57:58,001 --> 00:57:59,310
you're getting promoted tomorrow,

703
00:57:59,334 --> 00:58:00,876
and yet you don't seem excited.

704
00:58:01,917 --> 00:58:03,501
Anything on your mind?

705
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:07,709
No... No.

706
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:10,001
I'm rather flattered.

707
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:12,626
Good.

708
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:37,792
What are you exactly,

709
00:58:37,959 --> 00:58:39,376
a good guy or a bad guy?

710
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:41,167
I did it to stay alive.

711
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,959
What would you have done?

712
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:49,709
I know...

713
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:52,584
you guys made a fortune.

714
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:53,792
Give me half the money.

715
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:57,542
Otherwise... I'll perform your story...

716
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:01,167
every day in front of the Division office.

717
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,459
Xiu...

718
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:09,251
what fortune?

719
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:11,501
There's no such thing.

720
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:18,709
Sir Zhao.

721
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:21,792
You know who I am?

722
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:24,834
Who doesn't in this town?

723
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:50,209
Not bad.

724
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:53,001
Your Excellency...

725
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:55,251
this flute is a family heirloom.

726
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:05,251
May I be excused?

727
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:20,376
Jianxing.

728
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:28,501
- There's something that I've been...
- Jianxing!

729
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:31,477
- Tell me...
- Jianxing, stop it!

730
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:33,251
Why did you have to buy me a promotion?

731
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,334
Where did you get the silver?

732
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:38,917
Tell me... You are my sworn brother,

733
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,876
and you set me up like this?

734
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:42,334
Tell me! Tell me!

735
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:44,084
Jianxing, stop it!

736
01:00:44,251 --> 01:00:46,751
- Lian, tell him the truth!
- Go away!

737
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,459
Yichuan... are you alright?

738
01:00:59,584 --> 01:01:01,376
- Yichuan.
- I'm fine.

739
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:17,584
Wei Zhongxian is not dead!

740
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:21,376
What?

741
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,917
Every penny he gave me is here.

742
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:33,334
That's for Jianxing.

743
01:01:35,376 --> 01:01:36,376
That's for Yichuan.

744
01:01:38,126 --> 01:01:39,209
And that's for Miaotong.

745
01:01:40,084 --> 01:01:41,334
I didn't think...

746
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,167
it would turn out this way.

747
01:01:43,751 --> 01:01:44,876
In that case,

748
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:46,584
we were in so many trouble...

749
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:48,959
because Wei Zhongxian wants to kill us.

750
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:51,501
I'd like to borrow...

751
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,435
some of your guards, if I may be so bold.

752
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,792
Zhao Jingzhong, you already screwed it up.

753
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:57,834
How dare you ask for Godfather's guards!

754
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,459
Jianxing, Lian...

755
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:06,542
Sir Zhao is very likely the man
in black last night.

756
01:02:08,417 --> 01:02:10,542
Han Kuang is performing an autopsy
in three days.

757
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:14,042
Those three have to be gone by the
day after tomorrow.

758
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:19,751
Yichuan...
don't say that unless you're sure.

759
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:21,251
I saw the arrow wound on his hand.

760
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,209
Lian's crossbow arrow...

761
01:02:23,626 --> 01:02:24,906
is different from anyone else's.

762
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:28,251
I saw the shape of Sir
Zhao's wound clearly.

763
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:32,959
Godfather,

764
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:36,417
within 24 hours, I will
have their heads for you.

765
01:02:38,584 --> 01:02:39,667
Jingzhong,

766
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:42,876
you didn't expose yourself to them,

767
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:45,167
did you?

768
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:51,334
Leave the country with me.

769
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:53,376
There is...

770
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:55,334
no place for you in the Capital anymore.

771
01:03:03,584 --> 01:03:04,959
Reluctant, aren't you?

772
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:08,167
Yichuan,

773
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:10,501
tie me up and take me to the authority.

774
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:14,584
It was my fault.

775
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,334
I can't get you two involved.

776
01:03:20,001 --> 01:03:21,401
The doctor's daughter is very nice.

777
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:23,251
Treat her with care.

778
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:26,084
Those who rely on their luck...

779
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:28,459
are gamblers,

780
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:30,709
and you...

781
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:34,626
won't make a very good one.

782
01:03:37,376 --> 01:03:38,376
Godfather...

783
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:45,542
I am ready to try my luck.

784
01:03:59,084 --> 01:04:00,084
Jianxing,

785
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:04,929
I only ask you to do one last thing for me.

786
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:06,709
Buy Miaotong's freedom.

787
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:11,167
Let's go!

788
01:04:11,584 --> 01:04:13,126
Let's leave town together.

789
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:20,042
Nobody needs to die.

790
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:22,876
We'll live peacefully... somewhere else.

791
01:04:26,501 --> 01:04:28,501
Yichuan, go pack your things.

792
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:31,167
We'll leave separately tomorrow.

793
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:39,209
We have to be out of town by nightfall.

794
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:57,917
Your Excellency.

795
01:04:58,334 --> 01:04:59,667
You're a skilled fighter.

796
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:01,876
- I want you to kill someone for me.
- 200 taels.

797
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:10,126
Here's 100, as an advance.

798
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:12,477
Who does Your Excellency want to kill?

799
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:14,376
An officer of the Zhanfu Division.

800
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:16,626
- Jin Yichuan.
- Who?

801
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,584
Don't you know we studied with
the same master?

802
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:21,042
People like you...

803
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,209
wouldn't care about that.

804
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:26,167
That's not what I meant.

805
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:30,834
That person is very dear
to me, like a brother.

806
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:34,667
You need to pay more!

807
01:05:57,042 --> 01:06:00,834
I Monkey King, will teach you a lesson.

808
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:25,376
Miaotong!

809
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:31,834
The contents need to be changed regularly,

810
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:33,376
or it won't work.

811
01:06:34,584 --> 01:06:36,001
Come here every three days,

812
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,334
and I'll change it for you.

813
01:06:39,959 --> 01:06:42,376
I'm leaving town today.

814
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,032
Are you here to see the doctor?

815
01:07:11,459 --> 01:07:14,376
- My father's out visiting a patient.
- That's okay.

816
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:16,959
I can wait.

817
01:07:17,626 --> 01:07:18,667
It's for you.

818
01:07:19,876 --> 01:07:21,756
The pardon letter from
the Ministry of Penalty!

819
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,542
Where did you get this?

820
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:26,834
I'm here today to set you free.

821
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,667
I'm leaving town.

822
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:30,584
Come with me.

823
01:07:32,376 --> 01:07:34,256
That's your condition for
giving me my freedom?

824
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:44,001
I came here...

825
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,334
to ask you a favor.

826
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:49,667
There's an official in the name of Yan.

827
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:51,376
His son, Yan Junbin...

828
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:54,834
I heard is now in prison.
Can you get him out?

829
01:07:55,584 --> 01:07:57,251
Yan Junbin was captured by us.

830
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:00,251
The three of us almost died at their house.

831
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:02,209
One of his hands...

832
01:08:04,126 --> 01:08:05,417
What happened to him?

833
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:09,417
Nothing!

834
01:08:19,001 --> 01:08:20,959
I can give you money to make arrangements.

835
01:08:22,834 --> 01:08:24,417
Please get him out.

836
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,310
You shouldn't squander your money this way.

837
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:30,501
It's my money, I can
decide what to do with it.

838
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:35,501
I never asked you for anything.

839
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:37,917
Just this once.

840
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:48,126
It's the Imperial Prison.

841
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:53,751
If you get him out...

842
01:08:55,459 --> 01:08:56,917
I'll come with you.

843
01:09:00,584 --> 01:09:02,167
When he reads this letter...

844
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:04,126
he'll trust you.

845
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,751
Lian... Lian...

846
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:15,209
- Is Miss Zhou coming with us?
- What time is it?

847
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:16,626
Three.

848
01:09:17,126 --> 01:09:18,584
Stay with Miss Zhou.

849
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,167
Where are you going?

850
01:09:21,334 --> 01:09:23,268
The gates won't be closed
for another four hours.

851
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,042
I'll be back by then.

852
01:09:34,876 --> 01:09:36,126
Listen...

853
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:38,292
I have many more bottles of drugs.

854
01:09:38,584 --> 01:09:41,209
Confess... and you won't
need to suffer anymore.

855
01:09:42,876 --> 01:09:45,310
Stop wasting your time with him.
Finish the last few bottles...

856
01:09:45,334 --> 01:09:47,001
and we can go home.

857
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,251
Officer... we have Commanders orders...

858
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:53,709
to keep feeding him this drug.

859
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:56,667
- Take a walk.
- But...

860
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,126
You didn't see me.

861
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:03,917
Go, go, go.

862
01:10:07,376 --> 01:10:09,376
Sir Yan, I am Shen Lian...

863
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:11,126
a friend of Miaotong's.

864
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:13,584
She asked me to get you out of here.

865
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:15,667
Miaotong...

866
01:10:26,084 --> 01:10:27,292
She wrote you a letter,

867
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:31,042
and asked me to bring it to you.

868
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:33,792
My eyes are gone.

869
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:36,167
Sir Shen, please...

870
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:38,542
read the letter to me.

871
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:40,417
Will you?

872
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:50,876
To Junbin...

873
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:52,642
The wrongs that have been done to you...

874
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:54,334
will be righted someday.

875
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,251
Please don't give up.

876
01:10:57,001 --> 01:11:00,876
You once said that you'd take me
to a beautiful place.

877
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,667
I'll be waiting for you.

878
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:09,917
Let's get out of here.

879
01:11:13,792 --> 01:11:14,917
Lian is back.

880
01:11:21,084 --> 01:11:23,501
Are you looking for Sir Shen?
He's not here.

881
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:24,893
I'm not looking for Sir Shen.

882
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:28,917
A Sir asked me to deliver
something to a Sir Jin.

883
01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:36,060
Prepare my sedan.
We're going to the Imperial Hospital.

884
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:37,084
Yes, Sir.

885
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:40,602
Your Excellency, Sir Han has left
for the Imperial Hospital.

886
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:41,626
Yichuan...

887
01:11:46,376 --> 01:11:47,459
There's still time.

888
01:11:48,459 --> 01:11:49,667
We can still make it!

889
01:12:16,209 --> 01:12:17,292
Gentlemen...

890
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:20,334
I need to make a trip to the
Division office tonight.

891
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:22,834
Would you care to join me?

892
01:12:23,459 --> 01:12:26,751
Sir Baihu, why do you need
to go there tonight?

893
01:12:28,251 --> 01:12:29,501
To take my punishment.

894
01:12:29,584 --> 01:12:33,167
- Tell Ting to do it.
- Yes, Sir.

895
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:37,376
- Sir Shen.
- Where's Miaotong?

896
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:39,167
I'm here to buy her freedom.

897
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:46,501
Doctor Zhang.

898
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:49,959
Doctor Zhang...

899
01:13:28,084 --> 01:13:29,251
Let her go.

900
01:13:36,001 --> 01:13:38,959
I'm aware that people
say you should never...

901
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:40,667
kill doctors,

902
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,042
but I had no choice.

903
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,417
Someone paid a price for your head.

904
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,917
A very high price.

905
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:49,834
I plan to kill you anyway,

906
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:52,292
so why not make some money?

907
01:13:52,417 --> 01:13:53,834
So let's not waste...

908
01:13:54,084 --> 01:13:55,334
any more time.

909
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:09,126
You picked a good one.

910
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:11,126
This girl...

911
01:14:13,209 --> 01:14:14,709
feels really good.

912
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,667
Why aren't you packed?

913
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:40,001
How is...

914
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:41,542
Sir Yan?

915
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:44,417
No big deal. You don't need to pack.

916
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:46,084
I'll buy you new things.

917
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:49,251
How is Sir Yan?

918
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:54,626
Miaotong...

919
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:57,334
I have bought you freedom.

920
01:14:58,001 --> 01:14:59,501
We have to hurry.

921
01:14:59,834 --> 01:15:01,542
The gates will be closed soon.

922
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,167
Where is Sir Yan? What happened to him?

923
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:19,167
I'm as good as dead.

924
01:15:20,334 --> 01:15:22,626
I can't imagine what else
they would do to me.

925
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:27,417
You don't need to wait for him.

926
01:15:29,876 --> 01:15:31,126
He's dead.

927
01:15:34,501 --> 01:15:35,584
I don't believe you!

928
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:38,042
You're only saying that
so I'd come with you.

929
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:41,459
I'm waiting for him.

930
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:46,001
I'm not lying.

931
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:50,876
I have a huge favor to ask.

932
01:15:52,251 --> 01:15:55,126
- Please kill me.
- I killed him.

933
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:58,334
He begged me to.

934
01:16:02,876 --> 01:16:04,126
If you're dead...

935
01:16:04,751 --> 01:16:06,501
what am I supposed to say to her?

936
01:16:07,626 --> 01:16:09,292
You chopped off my hand.

937
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:13,876
Kill me... and we're even.

938
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:15,834
You knew it was me?

939
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,459
Tell Miaotong that...

940
01:16:30,126 --> 01:16:31,709
she doesn't need to wait for me.

941
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:36,626
We have to hurry.

942
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:52,292
We have a change only if we go now.

943
01:17:12,251 --> 01:17:13,251
Miaotong...

944
01:17:14,501 --> 01:17:15,501
we must leave.

945
01:17:19,084 --> 01:17:20,292
I was 12 years old...

946
01:17:23,209 --> 01:17:25,209
when Imperial Assassins
ransacked our house.

947
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,751
It was also them...

948
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:34,542
who brought me to this place.

949
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:44,584
Ever since the first time I saw you.

950
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:47,084
I've been scared of you.

951
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:49,917
I hated your uniform...

952
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,959
and that blade.

953
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:56,334
You think I like you?

954
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:58,501
I'm just scared of you.

955
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:07,751
I know...

956
01:18:09,834 --> 01:18:11,417
you've been good to me,

957
01:18:13,501 --> 01:18:15,334
better than anyone.

958
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:18,459
But I just can't let it go.

959
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:22,542
I saw your face so clearly.

960
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:29,626
On the day my family was ransacked.

961
01:18:31,417 --> 01:18:32,959
I saw you.

962
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,667
You arrested my father with your own hands.

963
01:18:40,834 --> 01:18:44,042
I don't know if I should
hate you or be grateful.

964
01:18:57,376 --> 01:18:59,209
Do you still want me to come with you?

965
01:19:01,792 --> 01:19:03,584
Sir Shen?

966
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:09,667
Sir Han...

967
01:21:11,209 --> 01:21:13,042
the bones are not right. He's too young.

968
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:15,001
He can't be Wei Zhongxian.

969
01:21:31,584 --> 01:21:34,126
Only when you're dead,
can Godfather live in peace.

970
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,042
Run for your life, when you still can.

971
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:49,376
Lui Jianxing... you have
deceived His Majesty!

972
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:51,001
Throw down your weapon.

973
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:54,751
Kill them.

974
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:38,751
Miaotong.

975
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:41,334
I'll take you to the doctor.

976
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:46,209
Leave me alone.

977
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:48,542
Jin Yichuan is at the Bailu Clinic.

978
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:51,376
Go find him.

979
01:23:06,376 --> 01:23:07,959
Why didn't you kill Wei Zhongxian?

980
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:10,667
- I wanted to live.
- It seems you want to die instead.

981
01:23:11,542 --> 01:23:12,584
Your Excellency,

982
01:23:13,626 --> 01:23:14,834
you have exposed yourself.

983
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,334
So what?

984
01:23:17,834 --> 01:23:19,501
If I kill you three...

985
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:23,209
I'll still be Commander
of the Secret Police tomorrow.

986
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:04,667
You are so dead! Not just you,

987
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:06,167
but this woman as well.

988
01:25:51,209 --> 01:25:53,917
Your Excellency! Your Excellency...

989
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:56,584
Your Excellency.

990
01:26:19,876 --> 01:26:21,834
If it weren't for me...

991
01:26:23,667 --> 01:26:26,376
you wouldn't end up like this.

992
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:28,209
You will yourself cut like this.

993
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:35,584
Even if I have one breath left.

994
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,584
I'm gonna kill you!

995
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,709
Those moves of yours...

996
01:27:54,042 --> 01:27:55,917
Master never taught me.

997
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:37,834
You're such a wreck.

998
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:40,001
Going on would be boring.

999
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:43,376
Consider our score settled today.

1000
01:28:47,709 --> 01:28:49,334
Don't hurt the girl.

1001
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:53,376
Don't hurt the girl.

1002
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,084
What if I tell you...

1003
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:04,459
that all I ever did was kill her father,

1004
01:29:04,834 --> 01:29:06,959
and I never laid a finger on her!

1005
01:29:07,834 --> 01:29:09,334
Would you be happy?

1006
01:29:22,459 --> 01:29:23,501
This is the end.

1007
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:36,292
But if I really kill you,

1008
01:29:39,376 --> 01:29:41,126
I'll be alone...

1009
01:29:44,834 --> 01:29:46,584
in this world.

1010
01:29:56,167 --> 01:29:57,167
Go away...

1011
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,751
Lui Jianxing?

1012
01:30:12,959 --> 01:30:14,501
I am Lui Jianxing.

1013
01:30:15,542 --> 01:30:16,667
Your Honor.

1014
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:19,959
Lui Jianxing...
did you let go of Wei Zhongxian?

1015
01:30:20,626 --> 01:30:22,542
- Yes.
- Why?

1016
01:30:28,626 --> 01:30:30,126
So where is Wei...

1017
01:30:30,501 --> 01:30:32,251
at the moment?

1018
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:34,834
I don't know.

1019
01:30:36,292 --> 01:30:37,709
Who ordered you to do that?

1020
01:30:38,334 --> 01:30:39,834
I took orders from no one...

1021
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:42,334
and worked with no one!

1022
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:44,834
It was all me.

1023
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:01,917
Your Majesty...

1024
01:31:02,001 --> 01:31:05,084
would you like me to
interrogate Lui Jianxing?

1025
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:07,334
I'll make sure he spill
out the other members.

1026
01:31:09,334 --> 01:31:11,292
I've already killed hundreds.

1027
01:31:11,709 --> 01:31:15,001
Even Yuan Chonghuan built a temple for Wei.

1028
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:17,834
Do you want to kill him too?

1029
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:21,126
You want there to be no man at my command?

1030
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,334
I would never dare.

1031
01:31:23,501 --> 01:31:26,584
Don't let Lui Jianxing name any more names.

1032
01:31:27,584 --> 01:31:29,751
- Kill him!
- I understand.

1033
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:32,876
Why is Zhao Jingzhong not here?

1034
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:34,792
Zhao Jingzhong...

1035
01:31:36,209 --> 01:31:37,459
He disappeared.

1036
01:32:18,876 --> 01:32:20,501
Clique Member Lui Jianxing...

1037
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:22,792
to be executed!

1038
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:27,709
I'm sorry.

1039
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:32,959
I'm so sorry for everything.

1040
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:38,251
The identity of the criminal...

1041
01:32:38,626 --> 01:32:40,209
has been verified.

1042
01:32:40,834 --> 01:32:41,834
Execute!

1043
01:32:56,209 --> 01:32:58,001
I'm so sorry for everything!

1044
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,167
Sir Jin.

1045
01:33:39,251 --> 01:33:43,917
"North Frontier, War
Zone, 2 months later."

1046
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,060
He's still following us.
It's been two weeks now.

1047
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:11,084
We just can't lose him.

1048
01:34:12,376 --> 01:34:13,459
It's Shen Lian.

1049
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:17,001
Shen Lian!

1050
01:35:17,459 --> 01:35:19,292
I gave you a change to live,

1051
01:35:20,209 --> 01:35:22,251
and you came back to haunt me.

1052
01:35:22,792 --> 01:35:24,167
If I don't kill you,

1053
01:35:24,459 --> 01:35:26,084
I'm as good as dead.

1054
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:31,334
You want to avenge your sworn brothers?

1055
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:35,001
Let me tell you something.

1056
01:35:35,709 --> 01:35:37,251
His Majesty only requested that...

1057
01:35:37,709 --> 01:35:39,459
Wei be taken back to the Capital,

1058
01:35:39,626 --> 01:35:41,042
but didn't want him dead.

1059
01:35:41,959 --> 01:35:43,584
It was me who wanted him dead.

1060
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:45,417
You faked His Majesty's order.

1061
01:35:46,084 --> 01:35:47,792
Even if we killed Wei Zhongxian,

1062
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,792
you would still kill us.

1063
01:35:52,334 --> 01:35:54,167
From the moment I approached you three...

1064
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:57,501
you were dead already.

1065
01:36:23,042 --> 01:36:25,459
Which of you is General
Li Yongfang's friend?

1066
01:36:30,001 --> 01:36:31,709
I am Zhao Jingzhong.

1067
01:36:33,501 --> 01:36:34,876
You're joining the Manchurians!

1068
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:39,084
Those two Han men are enemies.

1069
01:36:46,251 --> 01:36:48,001
Kill him! Go...

1070
01:36:52,959 --> 01:36:54,126
As I said before,

1071
01:36:55,126 --> 01:36:56,334
you're suicidal!

1072
01:36:56,792 --> 01:37:00,126
The reason why our country
is wrecked with problems...

1073
01:37:00,542 --> 01:37:02,667
and people can barely make ends meet...

1074
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,167
is because of people like you!

1075
01:37:06,959 --> 01:37:08,376
As long as I'm standing...

1076
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:11,042
you have no change of leaving alive.

1077
01:37:16,376 --> 01:37:18,084
Ding Xiu, is no match for them.

1078
01:37:18,251 --> 01:37:19,959
And you...

1079
01:37:21,209 --> 01:37:22,584
you really think you can kill me?

1080
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:30,917
Your sidekick won't last much longer.

1081
01:39:32,209 --> 01:39:33,501
Neither will you!

1082
01:40:17,876 --> 01:40:20,084
Why did you approach us
three in the first place?

1083
01:40:20,751 --> 01:40:22,959
You worthless people...

1084
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:26,709
who would care if you died?

1085
01:40:28,126 --> 01:40:29,751
When I want you crushed,

1086
01:40:30,167 --> 01:40:31,501
you are crushed!

1087
01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:33,709
Zhao Jingzhong...

1088
01:40:34,417 --> 01:40:36,459
you're no longer Commander
of the Secret Police.

1089
01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:38,584
You lost everything...

1090
01:40:39,042 --> 01:40:41,251
thanks to us worthless people.

1091
01:42:58,501 --> 01:42:59,667
Go down south,

1092
01:43:00,542 --> 01:43:01,751
to Suzhou.

1093
01:43:03,126 --> 01:43:04,376
When you get there...

1094
01:43:05,001 --> 01:43:06,792
go to Qijia Lane...

1095
01:43:07,584 --> 01:43:09,264
and find the second courtyard on the left.

1096
01:43:09,834 --> 01:43:11,084
Your Zhou Miaotong...

1097
01:43:11,334 --> 01:43:12,876
and the Zhang girl...

1098
01:43:13,584 --> 01:43:14,709
are both there.

1099
01:43:17,376 --> 01:43:19,126
- Thank you.
- No need.

1100
01:43:21,126 --> 01:43:22,959
If you didn't kill Zhao Jingzhong...

1101
01:43:23,959 --> 01:43:25,959
I would have killed you both.

1102
01:44:11,584 --> 01:44:14,292
Jianxing... when we leave Beijing,

1103
01:44:14,876 --> 01:44:17,042
- where would you want to go?
- Me?

1104
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:21,251
To Quanzhou. I want to
show my mother the ocean,

1105
01:44:21,626 --> 01:44:22,876
and the big ships.

1106
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:25,542
Lian, what about you?

1107
01:44:27,126 --> 01:44:28,334
Suzhou, I guess.

1108
01:44:29,751 --> 01:44:30,917
Enough about us.

1109
01:44:31,126 --> 01:44:32,917
Where do you want to go, Yichuan?

1110
01:44:33,709 --> 01:44:35,185
I want to go beyond the northern borders.

1111
01:44:35,209 --> 01:44:36,959
I heard there are very few people there.

1112
01:44:37,126 --> 01:44:40,334
I wonder... what that feels like.
