1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,235
The six of us
met in elementary school,

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,073
and we've been together
ever since.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,633
The sex, the Saturday nights,
all of that came way later.

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,350
And not all of it was my idea,
no matter what they say.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,716
The boxes have been with us
as long as we've been together,

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,874
and they're a snapshot
at any given time of who we are.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,474
The rules of the boxes
are simple.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,551
You can put something in,

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,392
take something out,

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,119
but you have to say why,

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,794
and your box
can never be empty.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,112
And the rules for the six of us
are just as simple:

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,158
Stay together, be a family,

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,189
love each other,
and never, ever apologize.

Wendy!

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,312
Whoo!

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,559
- Hi!
- Hello.

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,629
Nice BMW.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,835
Check this shit out.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,994
Hi.

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,230
Where'd you get
your purse? Target?

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,276
Hello.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,271
- Don't do it.
- You can buy 'em. I made mine.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,998
- Hey, wo-man.
- Hey, sweetheart.

48
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,115
Hey.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,553
Seriously, guys, see her tan?

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,959
- Yeah.
- Yes.

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,995
- That's okay.
- I know.

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,069
We have all day.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,479
- Are you serious?
- Eww!

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,595
- Yikes.
- What?

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,908
You should burn that hat.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,399
- Yeah.
- Wait. No, you can't.

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,550
- You can't burn it.
- It's plastic. Toxic fumes.

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,676
Well, he could burn
a little bit of it.

59
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,159
- Yeah, why not?
- Symbolically.

60
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,152
Come on. Do it.

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,195
- Burn it a little bit.
- Burn it?

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,395
Lt'll be good for you.

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,435
- Take the lighter.
- "Burn me!"

64
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,839
All right. All right.

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,390
"I don't like von Dutch.
Burn me."

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,435
- Come on, dude.
- Do it.

67
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,555
Ooh, God, it smells really bad.

68
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,595
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,911
- Whoo-whoo!
- There it goes!

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,991
Sorry about that.

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,229
What?

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,629
I like your necklace.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,395
"I like your necklace."

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,754
Bitch.

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,717
Okay, I think we've successfully
oriented ourselves.

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,358
- Yep.
- Shall we?

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,670
Ann, let go.

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,113
Are you leaving?

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,155
Uh, no,
I got to wait for my brother.

80
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,071
- Ooh, wrong way.
- Bye.

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,595
- Bye.
- Bye.

82
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,276
Bye! Bye.

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,429
All right, so what?

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,875
I'll just, uh,
call you later?

85
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,076
Call me later.

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,116
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,315
Kiss her, yeah!

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,355
What the fuck, man?

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,112
Seriously.

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,034
When did being a lesbian become
cooler than blowing a rock star?

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,189
You've never blown
a rock star.

92
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,111
Neither have you.

93
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,315
- So?
- So?

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,632
What if you could
blow a rock star?

95
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,950
Ruin what we have? Mmm...

96
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,189
That's my girl!

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,998
Ow! Yes.

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,438
- See ya.
- Wait. Wait.

99
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,556
Had to cut our string.

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,712
- Bye.
- See you later.

101
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,198
You're not blowin' up
the school, are you?

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,236
Did you follow me here?

103
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,439
I'm just trying to get
the lay of the land, so...

104
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,238
The lay of the land, huh?

105
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,958
Yeah.

106
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,634
I'm new,
so I figured I could,

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,995
I don't know, memorize
where everything was.

108
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,593
Not much to memorize.

109
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,591
So please tell me you're
not blowing anything up.

110
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,076
Get the lights for me?

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,030
Okay, I read about this,
and I really wanted to try it.

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,671
Apparently,
the electrons get excited.

113
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,478
I think it's so cool how they
have human names, you know,

114
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,313
like, "Excited,"
"Aggressive," "Lazy."

115
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,197
Ooh, some of them can
even be "lmpure."

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,429
Hmm?

117
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,999
Let's see.

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,912
That <i>is pretty cool.</i>

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,595
But couldn't you
just try this during class?

120
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,150
Nah. I hate chemistry.

121
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,028
- Your secret's safe with me.
- Hmm! Who would you tell?

122
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,793
Right. Uh, well,
my mom's a chemist,

123
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,474
so I'd never make fun of you
for liking this stuff.

124
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,629
Wendy!

125
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,353
- Come on!
- My brother Nathan.

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,715
Can we go home
already... please?

127
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,515
You coming?

128
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,472
Uh... hey, I'm Sean.

129
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,709
Hi.

130
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,518
These are the classrooms.

131
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,397
Have you read <i>The Watchmen?</i>

132
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,153
I have all of them, if you want
to, uh, come over, hang out.

133
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,151
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll read 'em.
- This is the library...

134
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,514
Or you could come
over tomorrow if you want.

135
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,431
And this is
the meeting area...

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,475
where people
like to get together

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,549
and talk about
the lack of respect

138
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,595
in the public bathrooms.

139
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,636
- Mm.
- "Respect," Again...

140
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,474
the word that comes up
all the time.

141
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,709
So, tomorrow, come over,
read 'em...

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,916
- Tomorrow or the...
- Nathan!

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,956
Wendy.

144
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,029
This is me.

145
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,792
Ah, this is me.

146
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,348
Yeah, I know.

147
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,873
You know?

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,312
- How do you know me?
- I mean, I...

149
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,597
I saw you around, you know.
I didn't know who you were.

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,270
Well,
I'm gonna head inside.

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,429
You could come over,
you know?

152
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,956
Ask my mom about impure
electrodes or whatnot.

153
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,873
- No, I'm cool. See ya.
- Okay, fine.

154
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,109
Why'd you tell him
he could come over on Saturday?

155
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,156
Why not?

156
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,358
<> I like all the girls,

157

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,028
Hey.

174
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,270
- Hi.
- Hey.

175
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,713
- Oh.
- Oh, hey.

176
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,791
Sorry.

177
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,871
Here, I, uh...
I brought these.

178
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,439
I thought... I thought
maybe you'd wanna read 'em.

179
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,159
Ahem. Yeah.
That's... that's cool, thanks.

180
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,151
- Yeah.
- Come on.

181
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,277
So, uh, well, thanks
for invitin' me over.

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,475
Oh, we're neighbours.

183
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,471
Yeah, so...

184
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,436
- Holy shit.
- Hmm?

185
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,592
My mom can
barely make pop tarts.

186
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,037
Actually, um, I made 'em,
so... I made everything.

187
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,553
Did you make this for me?

188
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,789
Yeah, I did.

189
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,996
I mean, I don't really get
a lot of guys over, so...

190
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,753
No. No, I mean, people.

191
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,909
- I don't get a lot...
- No, no, no. That's...

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,115
I don't get
a lot of people over.

193
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,633
- I don't... over.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. No.

194
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,994
Look... That... That's okay.
I didn't mean... It's just...

195
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,035
I didn't mean
anything by that.

196
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,075
Because I just like to cook.

197
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,115
That... That's the thing.
I like to cook.

198
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,155
Okay.

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,958
It's... I didn't, like,
plan everything.

200
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,473
That would be weird. I've...

201
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,629
I'm not gonna
eat that one, um...

202
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,675
No. I'll...
I'll put that one back.

203
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,910
- Okay.
- I just... No, really.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,194
I mean, like, this
isn't a trap or anything.

205
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,349
I didn't think it was...
I didn't think it was a trap.

206
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,634
Well, good, because if you just
wanna try these.

207
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,675
I mean, these are
really easy to make.

208
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,715
That's actually...
Um, I don't really...

209
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,915
So you can try these.
Oh, sh...!

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,955
Dude.

211
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,508
- Um...
- Mm-mm.

212
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,192
Uh...

213
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,355
- Yeah.
- Um...

214
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,271
I'm gonna... I'll clean up.

215
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,315
- I'll help you clean up.
- Good, I'm... No, that's fine.

216
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,355
I'm just gonna
go wash my hands.

217
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,032
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna... Why don't
I clean up for you?

218
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,315
- Yeah, okay.
- Just, uh...

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,389
Oh, God.

220
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,271
Hey, have you seen
that kid, Sean, at school?

221
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,509
Barely.

222
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,953
He's so transparent,
see-through.

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,519
He's from Chicago.

224
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,194
So did he transfer
as a senior?

225
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,077
I guess.
Lots of people transfer.

226
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,196
Yeah, in third grade,
people transferred.

227
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,840
People in our class
have been there forever.

228
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,638
Dude, whatever. He's boring.

229
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,233
Pasty and colourless.

230
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,548
Looks like a pigeon
shat on his head.

231
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,595
Yeah.

232
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,908
He's actually really nice.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,833
He's nice. <i>Nice.</i>

234
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,956
He's nice.

235
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,076
He is.
He was nice to Nathan.

236
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,355
Oh, your brother's
easy to be nice to,

237
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,998
like puppy dogs
or homeless people.

238
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,035
Billie.

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,553
What?!

240
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,914
What?

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,274
- He's...
- Nice.

242
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,554
It's not like
I'm making him out

243
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,868
to be Sean the Saint
or anything.

244
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,714
- If we were normal girls...
- Which we're not.

245
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,074
We'd be all over that shit.

246
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,559
Okay, fresh meat...

247
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,595
Off the rack.

248
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,636
Thank God we're not normal.

249
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,675
Yeah.

250
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,829
Hey, hey.

251
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,875
Hey.

252
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,915
I really can't
take you seriously

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,877
with that on your head.

254
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,632
Pretty sexy.

255
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,393
Soda? Anyone?
Would you like some?

256
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,799
- Please.
- I would.

257
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,952
Your ass looks good
in those jeans.

258
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,359
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

259
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,716
Oh, shoot. Aw, Jesus.

260
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,159
I was supposed
to take that out. I can do it.

262
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,708
Oh. Okay.
You need any help?

263
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,314
- Sure. I mean, yeah.
- Okay.

264
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,189
You know, it was
really sweet of you

265
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,316
to hang out with Nathan.

266
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,474
Yeah, sure. Uh, Nathan's weird,
but potentially very cool.

267
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,471
- Temporarily weird.
- Hmm.

268
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,472
Empirical proof that,
uh, phases are real.

269
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,595
- Yuck.
- Yeah.

270
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,033
Well, here.
Let me help you.

271
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,712
Oh, thank you, Sean.

272
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,316
There we go.

273
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,435
Is your hand okay?

274
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,795
Yeah, you know, just when you
touch something gross.

275
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
- Yuck.
- Oh... hmm.

276
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,751
- Oh, no, not you.
- Oh. Well, that's a relief.

277
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,319
- Not me.
- I meant... I meant the trash.

278
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,868
- Oh, okay.
- Not you.

279
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,912
- I'm gonna go inside.
- Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,798
You know, um,
you're kind of weird, too.

281
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,599
Did you make that up?
I like that line.

282
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,193
Who says it was a line?

283
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,589
Well, if you're being earnest,
then that's mean.

284
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,275
So does that mean you're hopeful
I'm trying to pick you up?

285
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,749
"Pick me up."

286
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,518
What is this, like 1976?

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,716
- You're pretty funny.
- No, I'm not.

288
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,233
- Yeah, you are. You're...
- Yeah.

289
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,836
You're smart, clever, funny,
you like science.

290
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,275
And all that equals ugly.

291
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,152
Well, you're
definitely not ugly.

292
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,753
Well.

293
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,637
You're just, um...

294
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,915
you're beautiful and smart.

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,752
Yeah.

296
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,558
Beautiful and smart.

297
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,917
Okay, I can't. I can't.

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,434
I can't.

299
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,919
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,989
- No, it's, uh...
- Shit.

301
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,197
It's okay, um...

302
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,113
Um, I'm not available.

303
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,759
If you don't know that already,
then you're gonna find out soon.

304
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,674
Ahem... all right.

305
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,830
Um... yeah. Okay.

306
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,275
I, um... I gotta...

307
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,395
Yeah.

308
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,870
- Sorry about everything.
- No, it's fine.

309
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,234
Have a good night.

310
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,599
Fuck!

311
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,678
Well, if it isn't Allyson
coming to put her claws in Sean.

312
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,228
She's quite
the little wench.

313
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,356
Yeah, apparently so.

314
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,676
Fuck, that was fast.

315
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,356
That poor boy has no idea
what he's getting into.

316
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,635
Mommy. Mommy.

317
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,837
- Come on, little bit.
- Check it out.

318
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,672
Shh shh shh!

319
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,359
Get in the car.

320
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,112
Come on.

321
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,349
<> Up, baby, up and down <>

322
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,509
- <> Come on <>
- <> Down, down <>

323
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,555
<> Till you
touch the ground <>

324
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,675

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,194
<> Come on <>

326
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,759
<> Shake it up
like I knew you would <>

327
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,432

of pole-shakin' action <>

328

329

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,399

<> Knees in the air,

332
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,274
So you met Wendy?

333
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,828
Uh, yeah, I met her.

334
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,708
Yeah. Then you know
all about the group?

335
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,755
Uh... no.

336
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,274
Oh, come on,
you know what I mean.

337
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,113
Horny. I understand
why the guys do it,

338
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,679
but girls?

339
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,149
It's total depravity.

340
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,231
Hey, you know, you should
talk to Ryan and Aaron.

341
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,673
Well, I mean,
you know they got out.

342
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,079
<> Pole-shakin' action,
booty like that <>

343
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,354
<> Put boys in traction <>

344
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,395
<> Run, run, run,

345
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,436
<> Run, run, run, run <>

346
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,431
What do you
mean, "Got out"?

347
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,158
What is it, like
a cult or something?

348
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,196
I guess. I mean...

349
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,748
I don't really know
what else you could call it.

350
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,592
Hey, don't you have to kill
yourself to be in a cult?

351
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,717
Uh... I don't know, Allyson.
Ahem.

352
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,791
And... And they all have sex
with each other.

353
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,791
Oh, it's pathetic. I know.

354
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,713
So how is what you're doing

355
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,791
any different than what
they're doing, I mean...

356
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,915
...<> till you
touch the ground <>

357
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,069
<> Up, baby, up and down <>

358
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,229
- Well, it just is.
- <> Down, down <>

359
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,639
<> Till you
touch the ground <>

360
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,756
You know, I invite them here
every single weekend,

361
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,910
and they never show.

362
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,228
They just think they're
so much better than us.

363
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,275
...<> till you
touch the ground <>

364
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,636
<> Up, down <>

365
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,789
Do you know they put
in a stripper pole?

366
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,156
- <> Up, down <>
- That is so cool.

367
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,151
- I'm gonna take a turn.
- Okay.

368
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,268
<> Up, down <>

369
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,475
Hey, baby!

370
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,515

- <> Down <>

376
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,232
- Hey!
- Hey!

377
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,389
Hi!

378
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,952
<> Such a small world <>

379
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,109
<> I seen her
just the other day <>

380
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,989
So, you know Wendy, right?

381
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,559
No. Really.

382
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,756
Um, look,
I just want to, uh...

383
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,717
I heard you... you two were...

384
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,994
I'm her next door neighbour,
so you know what...

385
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,229
Yeah.

386
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,117
Look, we had this...
It was like a...

387
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,395
It was an arrangement, okay?
The eight of us.

388
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,799
And when Aaron and I decided

389
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,553
we didn't wanna be a part
of it anymore, we left.

390
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,476
It's not like I had
to be deprogrammed or anything.

391
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,474
Everybody wants it
to be some big deal.

392
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,514
- So it's like this club...
- No. No.

393
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,636
- Okay, what is it, then?
- It isn't an "lt."

394
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,598
Okay. Wait, hold on
for one second, okay?

395
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,911
Hey, you can go on in.
I'm just...

396
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,560
Ahem... All right,
so whatever...

397
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,595
whatever this thing is,

398
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,796
it's enough of a thing where
I can't talk to her, right?

399
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,996
No. I...

400
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,798
I don't know. Maybe you
can talk to her at school.

401
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,472
Okay? You should...

402
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,629
You know, you should join
the student council.

403
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,756
I mean, we all...
They're all in it.

404
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,795
I don't do it anymore.

405
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,838
You're kidding, right?
Student council?

406
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,151
What, you thought we just
hung out and smoked crack?

407
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,754
No. I don't know. L...

408
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,989
- I don't know.
- Amnesty, we...

409
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,638
We did model congress.

410
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,792
Um, last year, we worked
on two local campaigns.

411
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,877
Smart kids who have sex.
It happens.

412
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,595
I have a question.

413
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,795
- What?
- I bet you do.

414
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,269
If you could torture anyone,
who would it be?

415
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,588
Who would it be?

416
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,318
I would definitely want
to torture Jack Black.

417
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,992
Why? He's funny.

418
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,274
He's perfect
torture material.

419
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,713
He's so fat and cute.
I love him.

420
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,438
He thinks he's funny
so he'd be laughing...

421
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,589
- Oh.
- Till I made him cry.

422
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,672
- Who would you torture?
- Lindsay Lohan.

423
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,193
How'd I know
you were gonna say that?

424
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,269
- I love you.
- I love you.

425
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,873
- Oh, I love you.
- Obvious and tired.

426
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,949
I love you.

427
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,234
Something original.

428
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,118
Hey, Ann, are you, uh... Are you
putting in or taking out?

429
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,195
Taking out.

430
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,316
I'm surprised
your box isn't empty.

431
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,119
I'd torture Eminem
without a doubt.

432
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,159
- Why, Jonah? Why the E-Man?
- He's so smug, you know?

433
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,071
It's like...
I just wanna tie him up

434
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,912
and shock him and stuff,
you know? Like...

435
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,399
Bzzzz!

436
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,436
In a tub of water,
like Abu Ghraib. Like, zzzz!

437
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,114
Nice. Oh, my God.
He's a gay boy.

438
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,315
What do you want, guys?

439
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,789
Oh! Oh! Oh!

440
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,472
The marbles that I stole
in fifth grade.

441
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,675
- Why?
- Huh?

442
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,796
- Because it's bad karma.
- Really?

443
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,313
You don't know
anything about karma.

444
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,152
I'll fuckin' show you
bad karma, bitch.

445
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,879
Wait a second.
I stole that marble...

446
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,075
You did!

447
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,115
And you were holding
onto it for me.

448
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,191
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, that's so right.

449
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,998
That's so right, right?
Because somebody said...

450
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,638
- "Rah rah rah..."
- Lisa Nishi.

451
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,517
- Dude!
- Lisa Nishi!

452
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,749
Totally Lisa Nishi.

453
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,558
Said that
if you stole the marble

454
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,755
that she would
let you sit with her

455
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,432
like during lunch period
or something?

456
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,033
I never said.

457
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,712
Who plays marbles anyways?

458
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,677
- It's like dip-shitty 1957.
- So...

459
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,988
Yeah.

460
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,035
- One Olsen.
- No!

461
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,075
- That's all I'd ask for.
- Uh-Uh!

462
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,115
- I don't need both of 'em.
- No way.

463
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,633
I just need one.
If I could have one,

464
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,312
I will be
so happy and stuff.

465
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,550
Really, it'd just be... I don't
know, completely delicious,

466
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,631
- and in the event...
- And then, there's another one?

467
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,869
You can just do it
all over again.

468
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,439
You wanna do it again?
Then go. Two times.

469
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,159
Double the pleasure,
and double the fun.

470
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,878
- Suck on that.
- Wendy, it's your turn.

471
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,313
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

472
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,355
- What?
- You can't mess with that.

473
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,510
- After...
- Oh, really?

474
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,910
Let's see. I am puttin'
in like a penis.

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,319
Oh, thank God.

476
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,356
You know, I'm so sick
of everyone taking out.

477
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,158
You know, it's like first,
you put it in the box

478
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,674
and cry for whatever
dumbass memory it stands for,

479
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,193
and then you fish it out,
saying you want it back.

480
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,269
- It's like...
- Crying?

481
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,679
- Who's crying?
- You know what I mean?

482
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,715
- It's...
- Who's crying now?

483
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,915
I'm crying.
I'm totally crying.

484
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,752
- No tears.
- I feel sad.

485
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,875
No tears.

486
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,473
- That was a gift.
- No tears.

487
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,710
What's left
in Senorita Price's box?

488
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,392
Yeah.

489
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,278
It's like, "Ooh, this is
the black nail polish I wore

490
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,349
when I wanted to be Goth."

491
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,953
Wait. What's it like?

492
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,712
- Hey, it's my box!
- It's like, "Ooh."

493
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,074
I can do whatever I want.

494
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,229
Hey, in more ways
than one, honey.

495
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,275
- Good point.
- It is your box.

496
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,315
Thank you.

497
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,753
- Wendy, you're putting that in?
- Yes.

498
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,955
Hootchie necklace,
in it goes.

499
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,110
- That was a gift.
- You know what?

500
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,350
You're the one always saying
that we shouldn't apologize.

501
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,032
I don't think
we're a fucking joke.

502
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,599
I don't think it's funny.

503
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,554
- I'm funny.
- You're freakin' hilarious.

504
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,512
Okay, either Abraham Lincoln...

505
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,478
- Whoa.
- Or me at 12 years old.

506
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,515
Double whoa.

507
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,750
Fuck, that's such
a good answer, man.

508
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,319
Yeah, I never
thought of that.

509
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,628
Right there.

510
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,717
Well... I went.

511
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,552
- We all went.
- We all went.

512
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,595
You fuckers
gonna help me clean up?

513
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,635
- No.
- No.

514
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,438
Dude, you have
a fucking maid, man.

515
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,669
I wish I cared.
I really wish I cared.

516
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,751
Who'll report back
to my fucking dad, man.

517
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,273
- I heard you.
- I wanna get up.

518
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,873
I'm uncomfortable.

519
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,396
- We suck.
- Eat it.

520
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,797
Oh.

521
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,592
I think Price got
really cute this summer.

522
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,557
Can we stop
using that word, "Cute"?

523
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,235
Bunnies are cute.
Pet rats are cute. Men are sexy.

524
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,958
They're not really men
yet, though, are they?

525
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,837
- They will be.
- And they'll be our men.

526
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,875
Mm...

527
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,598
And in 10 years,
they'll be the strongest,

528
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,636
smartest men around,
and they'll be all ours.

529
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,029
Mmm. In 10 years?

530
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,315
Yeah, in 10 years,
I won't be here.

531
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,953
Why not?

532
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,110
What, after
all you've invested,

533
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,636
after almost 17 years
of training, of learning?

534
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,473
What, you just think that
you're gonna start from scratch?

535
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,116
Are you serious?
What... What's your plan?

536
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,270
Are you just gonna get a big
mansion in Utah or something?

537
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,318
- We'll all live together!
- Yes! Oh, yes!

538
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,197
- You'll see.
- Yes.

539
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,599
We'll all
go to college together,

540
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,432
and we'll get houses next door.

541
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,675
Hello.

542
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,273
- Oh!
- Ow! Aha!

543
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,713
Oh, my head!

544
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,993
Aah!

545
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,829
You have
like 16 split ends.

546
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,114
Shut up.

547
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,632
Do you think that
when we go to college that...

548
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,711
Shh!

549
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,472
This is the best time.

550
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,991
This is the time

551
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,469
when we don't have to think
about things like college.

552
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,229
It's Sunday.

553
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,117
You're a genius.

554
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,910
Shh. We're supposed to be
having our quiet Zen time.

555
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,472
Ooh! Schedule! Give.

556
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,198
It's almost identical
to mine.

557
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,919
What, you didn't hack
into the computers,

558
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,672
get us all
in the same classes?

559
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,354
That would be wrong,
and I'm never wrong.

560
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,192
I have seen you so wrong.

561
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,111
Besides, if we all have
the same classes,

562
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,031
we wouldn't have an opportunity
to meet anybody new.

563
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,872
There isn't
anybody new here, sweetheart,

564
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,188
except
maybe the preschoolers.

565
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,191
No. Sean.

566
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,999
He moved in next door to Wendy,
went out with Allyson.

567
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,230
Remember
when tongue touching

568
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,356
was like the weirdest
thing in the world?

569
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,159
You know, you think that...
that kissing somebody new

570
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,196
is kinda like that, like...
like touching tongues?

571
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,710
Think I totally skipped
tongue touching

572
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,233
and went straight
for tongue wrestling.

573
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,833
I seem to recall.

574
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,592
I recall you were
my willing victim.

575
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,352
That's what I remember.

576
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,715
<> Aah <>

577
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,314
Oh, yes,
ain't nothing classier

578
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,231
than a girl who'll go down
on you in a basement.

579
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,595
I love that you are
the arbiter of class.

580
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,830
Yeah, me too.

581
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,992
Mmm!

582
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,116
Hey, jealous.

583
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,474
Oh!

584
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,959
- Mmm!
- Hello.

585
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,995
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

586
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,957
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

587
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,871
Hey, guys.

588
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,157
Rarr rarr rarr
rarr rarr...

589
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,472
I think what Sophocles
is saying is that man...

590
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,672
like people,
like man and woman,

591
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,911
they're in this battle
that can't be won.

592
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,309
But they have to fight,
you know,

593
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,389
'cause they have this nature,

594
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,710
this, what do you call it,
nature?

595
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,438
Mm-Hmm.

596
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,193
Like a Sicilian.

597
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,759
Right on.

598
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,398
That's great.

599
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,075
Ahem.

600
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,993
I'm just a guy.
I'm not the man.

601
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,876
You can contribute.
Go ahead, talk.

602
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,439
Okay, uh...

603
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,795
Well, see, I actually...
I think you mean, um, Sisyphus.

604
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,393
Oh. Wait, we don't...
We don't, um...

605
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,152
We don't correct people.
Um, we... You know, we...

606
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,719
We gather together,
and we add things,

607
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,519
and we contribute
and discuss,

608
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,875
but we don't correct.

609
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,394
Uh, everything that's brought
to the circle has merit.

610
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,158
Do you have anything
that you wanna contribute?

611
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,514
Promethean.

612
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,668
- Wendy?
- If you're gonna help him out,

613
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,715
you might as well
really help him out.

614
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,791
Promethean, not Sisyphean.

615
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,909
Oh, and for the record,

616
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,594
not everything
said here has merit.

617
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,513
<i>Scheisse.</i>

618
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,397
Hey, will you walk me home?

619
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,629
Yep.

620
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,195
- Bye.
- Cool.

621
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,316
Love you, guys,
and I totally mean it.

622
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,709
No, she doesn't.

623
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,550
So, how many schools
do we have in common?

624
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,595
For next year?

625
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,908
- Yeah.
- Uh...

626
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,194
No, right now, dumbass.

627
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,157
Yeah, uh...

628
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,196
- Careful.
- I don't know, maybe five.

629
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,235
Out of...?

630
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,275
Uh, six or seven?

631
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,315
- Oh.
- Yeah.

632
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,389
Those are pretty
good odds, then, right,

633
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,959
that we'll all get
in the same school?

634
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,679
Ooh, well, Jonah will get in
wherever he wants,

635
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,638
but he'll go where we go.

636
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,914
Hmm.

637
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,194
Why?

638
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,673
Oh, oh!

639
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,715
I'll throw you
in the water!

640
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,518
Oh! Pfft!

641
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,913
Sorry.
Shh. It's okay.

642
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,149
- No. I'm not talking.
- Everything under control.

643
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,195
- We are fighting.
- I love you.

644
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,235
- We're fighting.
- Love you. Mean it.

645
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,469
- We're fighting.
- Love you. Mean it.

646
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,475
Ladies.

647
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,879
- I need a mike, too.
- Testing, one, two.

648
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,279
- Testing.
- I need a mike.

649
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,033
Are you trying
to miss them?

650
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,473
- Yes!
- Up, up!

651
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,834
- Nice!
- Yeah!

652
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,875
Let's see, Maur,

653
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,679
what the lovely Billie
has for us tonight.

654
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,034
Are you ready, Rhonda?
Are you ready?

655
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,112
Ladies and ladies...

656
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,155
That's me and you!

657
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,629
Get your sandwiches out
and your wafers

658
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,395
'cause we're ready to bid
on some sexy fellas.

659
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,869
First up, we have Johnny!

660
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,632
Whoo!

661
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,994
Whoo! Johnny!

662
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,877
Oh, my God!

663
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,951
Oh, my God! I do say.

664
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,632
Wearing the traditional
cowboy look

665
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,789
with a little bit of pizzazz.

666
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,199
Get on up there, monkey.

667
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,235
Maureen, I gotta tell ya,

668
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,788
I've never seen pants
so tight in my life.

669
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,075
Is that right?
That's fabulous.

670
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,118
That is about the best piece
of ass I have seen in years.

671
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,158
I would do him eight Sundays
in a row and a Sabbath.

672
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,195
Thank you.

673
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,474
Hey, sexy.

674
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,879
Whoo!

675
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,279
Can I just make
an addition right here?

676
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,713
Yes, absolutely.

677
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,755
Cry-Baby.

678
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,273
Cry...

679
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,272
A moment of silence for Depp.

680
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,032
Okay!

681
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,678
- Very nice.
- Nice.

682
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,715
Love him.

683
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,713
Next up, we have... Bernard.

684
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,518
Bernard!

685
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,238
<i>Ay dios mio.</i>

686
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,834
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, wow.

687
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,478
Look at his hair!

688
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,314
Maur, you can see
the fabulous faux leather pants.

689
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,152
Those were featured
last week

690
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,711
by Nicole Richie,
actually in a bra.

691
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,114
You look amazing.

692
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,792
- You think so?
- Amazing.

693
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,074
Fantastic.

694
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,230
Billie, I wanna
give you new hair?

695
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,831
Sexy.

696
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,911
Pull the pants down.

697
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,513
Whoo!

698
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,830
Eat the microphone. Eat it.

699
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,150
Yeah!

700
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,832
Oh, look, he's like
a little brontosaurus.

701
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,239
- Oh, God.
- That's right.

702
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,992
- I'm gonna vomit.
- Very nice.

703
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,996
And last, but definitely
not least, we have... Chip!

704
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,150
- Chip?
- Chip!

705
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,593
Very nice!

706
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,958
<> Wah wah wah <>

707
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,553
- I love the anarchist look.
- Yeah.

708
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,039
Who's got dollar bills?
We're gonna...

709
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,156
- Yeah!
- I don't, but I have cookies.

710
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,195
Hey!

711
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,235
Bling-Bling.

712
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,992
Put 'em in the shorts!
Put 'em in the shorts!

713
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,354
- Ahh!
- Whoo!

714
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,874
I am definitely feeling
some joy at this moment.

715
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,474
- Whoo!
- Look at that ass, Maur.

716
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,915
Oh, my God.

717
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,468
My goodness. The belt.
An added touch.

718
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,357
- I like it.
- Whoo!

719
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,556
Very nice.

720
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,631
You can see they've been
prepping for the Olympics

721
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,119
all summer.

722
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,395
Very nice.

723
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,950
Gotta make my money.
Gotta make my money.

724
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,271
I don't have dollar bills,
but I have cookies.

725
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,113
- Dance for the money.
- Whoo!

726
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,039
Lovely!
Who's gonna eat that?

727
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,917
Billie, I would like
to congratulate you

728
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,989
on a wonderful display.

729
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,513
Yay!

730
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,319
Your fashion line-up's
so beautiful, so moving,

731
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,435
so revolutionary.

732
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,033
Whoo!

733
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,714
Um, now, I hope you'd all
like to join us on the table.

734
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,595
Morning.

735
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,829
Morning.

736
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,153
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning.

737
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,754
I would kill for your body.

738
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,278
Best thing I can say
is don't get pregnant.

739
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,713
I'd have
a flat stomach by now

740
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,917
if I'd stayed a person
and not become a mother.

741
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,911
Mom!

742
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,228
Exactly.

743
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,154
Geez. Can we go?

744
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,155
- Hold on.
- How?

745
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,397
- You go.
- Where?

746
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,515
Go see
if he wants a ride.

747
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,068
Shut up.
He'll think I'm gay.

748
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,309
What?

749
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,913
Why?

750
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,560
- Well, I don't know.
- So go.

751
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,313
- But I'm not gay.
- Why do you even care?

752
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,389
I completely care.

753
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,358
Are you gonna ask a girl
out today?

754
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,714
- Hmm?
- Mm, no.

755
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,509
No? Then be
a little gay for me.

756
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,993
You be a little gay.

757
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,912
Guess you're
our new neighbours.

758
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,635
Yeah. I'm
your next door Nathan.

759
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,073
Sorry?

760
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,792
I mean, I'm your
next door neighbour, Nathan.

761
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,233
Helen.

762
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,114
Okay.

763
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,273
Well?

764
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,193
I forgot. Sorry. It's... I...

765
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,474
What?

766
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,793
- Hi.
- Hey.

767
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,838
Um, my brother was supposed
to come over here

768
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,753
and ask if Sean wanted
a ride to school.

769
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,909
What happened?

770
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,039
Well, I think he was dropped
on his head as a child.

771
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,872
My brother, not your son.

772
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,837
- Well, that would be great.
- Yeah.

773
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,638
The ride, not the head drop.

774
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,239
You rang?

775
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,389
Sorry. I thought
that was Sean's room.

776
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,959
It is.

777
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,109
Well, uh, tell him
he's got a ride waiting.

778
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,474
All right.

779
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,278
So I heard
you were a scientist.

780
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,713
Yeah, I am, actually.

781
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,153
I'm in a bit
of a holding pattern.

782
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,879
But are you interested
in science or math?

783
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,279
Yeah. A little bit, so...
Ready?

784
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,078
- Yeah.
- See ya.

785
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,639
See ya.

786
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,314
- Wendy.
- We need your help.

787
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,833
Billie's acting
as the big, bad wolf again.

788
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,353
Ooh!

789
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,915
Dorito?

790
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,109
Is there a problem, ladies?

791
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,599
Women.

792
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,955
We wanna be referred to
as women.

793
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,633
Women.

794
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,950
Yes, "Women,"
I think it's time to go.

795
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,871
We're leaving?

796
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,511
Yeah. We have a senior meeting
and some other... things...

797
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,794
- Okay.
- To do.

798
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,313
I'll go to a "Thing."

799
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,277
No, I said
some other things.

800
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,191
- That, too.
- Hey. Psst!

801
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,235
Don't be an instigator.

802
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,719
Well, I was
just tryin' to make sure

803
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,711
our little housewife
is bein' a good girl.

804
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,716
- What do I always tell you?
- Because they named her Ryan...

805
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,279
After a soap opera.

806
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,471
Don't name kids
after soap operas.

807
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,309
Mm! How many times do we
have to tell you people?

808
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,475
Hope you weren't counting
on a basketball scholarship.

809
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,193
You know, it's impossible to be
with me. You know that, right?

810
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,956
You wanna be with me,
don't you?

811
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,836
Well, I wanna kiss you.

812
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,873
I mean, pretty much every time
I see you, I wanna kiss you.

813
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,075
You know Ryan? She used
to be one of my best friends,

814
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,151
and now we don't
even talk anymore.

815
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,758
- And Aaron?
- Aaron.

816
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,711
I've seen him naked
a bunch of times, you know.

817
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,438
He's like my ex-boyfriend.
You have ex-girlfriends, right?

818
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,475
It's like the same thing.

819
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,675
Oh, I don't know
if that's the same.

820
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,878
- I know you don't.
- It doesn't make any sense.

821
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,157
What? Why I'm
so naturally athletic?

822
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,836
You never even asked me
if it's true.

823
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,672
Well, is it?

824
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,070
It's like a Greek tragedy
waiting to happen.

825
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,839
I don't live in that world.

826
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,876
Oh, yeah?
And what world is that?

827
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,279
The world of boyfriends,

828
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,113
of... of... of holding hands,
of first dates?

829
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,349
No, you jackass.

830
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,508
Of disposable girlfriends
and bracelets for blowjobs

831
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,751
and making out and macking
and hooking up and going down

832
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,353
and text-messaging some guy

833
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,556
that's gonna come
all over my shirt.

834
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,635
That world.

835
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,035
Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

836
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,680
Really?
I can take a guess.

837
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,198
Okay, so what
about the other world?

838
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,271
The world where there's
just one girl and one guy,

839
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,956
and, you know, we just go out
with each other, nobody else?

840
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,155
- What about that world?
- Hmm.

841
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,791
You mean fairy tale land?
I've heard of that place.

842
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,390
Well, what if it was real?

843
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,034
You gonna rescue me, huh?

844
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,350
Just you and me
against the world?

845
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,911
- If you want me to.
- Mm.

846
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,119
Hmm?

847
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,549
Did you just sigh?

848
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,234
Um... ahem. No, it was...

849
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,355
Did I hear
a little sigh right now?

850
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,317
No, there was no sigh.
It was just, I... I made a noise.

851
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,197
Kind of sounded like a girl
in a romance novel.

852
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,349
Christ.

853
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,199
Well, I don't know
what to say.

854
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,635
I just made a noise.
It was...

855
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,556
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

856
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,193
Ohhh... Ahhhhh!

857
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,919
- Mmmmm!
- Yes!

858
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,359
Oh!

859
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,119
Did you hear that?
We did that.

860
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,274
Hey...

861
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,955
Leave them, okay?
You just be with me.

862
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,431
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

863
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,795
Maybe what?

864
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,632
- Maybe...
- Maybe what?

865
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,631
Maybe...

866
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,270
- Price?
- Oh, thank God.

867
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,679
What?

868
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,228
- You're gonna laugh.
- No, I'm not.

869
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,150
- Your hair.
- Yeah.

870
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,753
I brought these pictures
into this guy.

871
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,832
He was really cool. He had
tattoos on his fingers, and...

872
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,828
- Wow. I just, uh...
- You don't like it?

873
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,558
I think it's cool.

874
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,271
What? You know...

875
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,749
I mean, you think
people will notice?

876
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,478
Yeah. Yeah.

877
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,233
- Be worse if they didn't.
- Would it?

878
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,749
I heard you thought
I got, uh, hotter.

879
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,274
Mmm, I think I said cuter.

880
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,078
Oh.
Is there a difference?

881
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,310
No, you did.

882
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,152
Lost a little bit of weight,
you've been workin' out.

883
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,958
I got a nose job.

884
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,788
What?

885
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,678
Yeah. And I do
crunches every day.

886
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,432
A hundred, sometimes 500.

887
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,793
I don't understand.
A nose job?

888
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,279
Yeah.

889
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,516
I wanna look good
for you guys.

890
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,589
I mean, it's worth it to me
to have all of you, each of you.

891
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,797
And... l'd get
10 more surgeries

892
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,030
and do a thousand more
sit-ups for you.

893
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,277
I mean, wouldn't you?
For all of us?

894
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,635
Hey.

895
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,438
Okay.

896
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,794
You wanna walk
over to Robert's with me?

897
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,435
Yeah?

898
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,078
Okay.

899
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,152
Um... I can't.

900
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,274
Sorry.

901
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,833
Hi.

902
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,473
Beer?

903
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,118
Really? Beer?

904
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,077
I don't know.

905
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,638
I really...

906
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,636
I really tried. I just wasn't
like, um... wasn't...

907
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,790
Listen, don't
ever fake it, right?

908
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,314
Right.

909
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,198
Because faking it
is for dumbass girls

910
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,429
who hook up
with the first guy

911
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,275
in baggy jeans and
some earth-fucking SUV.

912
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,751
And we are not those girls.
You are not that girl.

913
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,637
Really?

914
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,472
Then what kind of girl am I?

915
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,794
A very bad girl.

916
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,233
Seriously.

917
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,673
"And when she was good,
she was very good.

918
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,228
"But when she was bad...

919
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,551
"she was horrid."

920
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,791
Oh! Oh, shit.

921
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,199
Hi.

922
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,357
Are you okay?

923
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,351
Um...

924
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,391
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

925
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,879
I can't promise
I'm not gonna jump you

926
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,951
in the middle of the night.

927
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:14,710
<> I swear I don't know
what time it is <>

928
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,632
<> But I know this means <>

929
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,837
<> Nothing much to me <>

930
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,514
<> And I hear the voices <>

931
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,116

932
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,760
<> Let go <>

933

<> To let go <>

937
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,115
I can't.

938
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,430
Y-You can't, and then you can.
You don't, and then you do.

939
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,670
I mean... how much more of this
am I supposed to take?

940
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,433
Just till graduation.
Just till graduation.

941
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,193
Oh, great.
Okay. All right, fine.

942
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,669
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

943
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,715
What, now you want me?

944
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,755
- Why?
- Hmm?

945
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,432
You can't wait seven months
for me? Just seven months.

946
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,589
You know what,
if you were gonna join...

947
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,511
If you were gonna join
the army or something,

948
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,079
you know, then...
then, yeah, maybe,

949
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,116
but you're gonna hook up
with three guys

950
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,155
for the next seven months.

951
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,071
You know what? I don't...
I don't think I can.

952
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,354
Hey.

953
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,992
Yeah?

954
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,230
You wanna be
like your parents?

955
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,517
Yeah, I guess.
They seem pretty happy.

956
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,158
Yeah, I guess.

957
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,475
- You know what?
- What?

958
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,316
You should meet me
this afternoon.

959
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,834
- Yeah?
- Mm-Hmm.

960
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,558
I don't know.

961
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,988
Maybe. Maybe, okay?

962
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,672
- Maybe?
- Maybe, yeah.

963
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,632
- Wait here.
- Ooh.

964
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,910
Ohh!

965
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,833
- Hi.
- Hi.

966
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,673
Um... is Sean home?

967
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,228
Uh, I think
he's still at school.

968
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,916
Okay. So, uh,
he actually lent me...

969
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,316
He, um...

970
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,551
He lent me these comics.

971
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,119
I read them.

972
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,356
Do you need help
with anything?

973
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,873
Unpacking?

974
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,031
So do you
stay home all day?

975
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,396
You mean, like a housewife?
God, no.

976
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,597
I work for a drug company
in research and development.

977
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,831
I used to teach science
part-time, but, you know,

978
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,035
now that Sean's grown up,

979
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,033
I... I get to have a real,
full-time job.

980
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,959
So... you didn't go
to work today, right?

981
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,270
Uh, no. L... I took
a little time to get settled.

982
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,036
You know, but... doesn't seem
to be that much to do.

983
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:07,956
What does, uh, your...
um, you know, Sean's dad...

984
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,519
- What's he do?
- Oh, Bill.

985
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,956
He's in finance,
um, you know, banking.

986
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,268
The funny thing is, he's...

987
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,874
he's, like, really bad
with money. Terrible...

988
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,872
except if it's
like millions.

989
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,949
I guess
it's not that funny.

990
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,112
No. Guess not.

991
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,473
Wow.

992
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,949
You... You made that
from my cupboard?

993
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,952
Yeah, I mean, be better
with some fresh hazelnut

994
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,031
and some powdered sugar,

995
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,157
but it's...
it's still really good.

996
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,310
Here, let me get you a fork.

997
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,875
Mmm.

998
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,435
- You cook a lot?
- Yeah. At home, a lot.

999
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,715
You know,
first it just started out

1000
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,313
with, you know,
the simple, basic...

1001
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,914
just steak, rice,
and green beans...

1002
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,072
Not that my mom or my sister
even noticed, but...

1003
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,039
then I just started
to teach myself lots of things.

1004
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,951
You know, I'm
pretty much self-taught.

1005
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,508
Just... I just taught myself

1006
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,354
how to make, um, fresh bread
and... and pastries.

1007
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,910
- Those are really, really easy.
- Who knew?

1008
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,516
I'll teach you
a couple things... um, for Bill.

1009
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,439
Uh... but right now,
I'm actually working

1010
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,988
on a glazed salmon
with risotto.

1011
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,514
- Oh.
- So, yeah.

1012
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,435
Did you know you have
to drive 90 minutes for frisee?

1013
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,476
It's ridiculous, but...

1014
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,949
You can cook for me anytime.

1015
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,910
Really?

1016
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,479
Absolutely.

1017
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,315
Ooh! Oh!

1018
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,389
Ow, ow!

1019
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,913
Ow!

1020
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,149
You landed on your butt!

1021
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,468
- No, I landed on my knee,
- Oh!

1022
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,549
And I broke it, actually.

1023
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,119
It wasn't that bad.

1024
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,155
Thanks.

1025
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,151
Ow!

1026
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,309
Oh, shut up.
That didn't hurt.

1027
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,358
- No, your rings.
- Oh. Sorry.

1028
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,999
- All right, that's okay.
- Wow. Hit me again.

1029
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,911
Come on, hit me for real.

1030
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,639
- What?
- Yeah. Come on.

1031
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,153
Hit me for real.

1032
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,276
I wanna see what it
feels like to get spanked.

1033
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,677
- No, I'm not gonna hit you.
- Come on.

1034
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,955
If I'm telling you it's okay,
then you're not gonna hurt me.

1035
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,349
- Come on, spank me.
- No.

1036
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,429
- Why not?
- Because...

1037
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,475
I've never
been spanked before,

1038
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,515
- Yeah, well...
- not once.

1039
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,874
Well, I have
been spanked, okay?

1040
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,235
My... I got spanked
when I was a kid for stealing.

1041
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,151
It hurts, it's cruel.
I'm never spanking my kids.

1042
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,195
I'm certainly
not gonna spank you.

1043
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,793
You have to.

1044
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,476
You know, sometimes,
they're bad,

1045
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,471
and they have to learn.

1046
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,156
I never learned.

1047
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,035
Spank me, please.

1048
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,189
Come on, just once.

1049
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,397
All right, this is... this is
gonna be quick, and then...

1050
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,314
- Okay, you know what?
- Come on. Keep going.

1051
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,355
- This is really weird.
- Why'd you stop?

1052
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,634
- Keep going.
- No, I can't.

1053
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,472
This... This is abnormal.

1054
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,035
I'm not abnormal.

1055
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,235
No, I didn't
say <i>you were abnormal.</i>

1056
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,676
- I just said this was...
- Fine, fine, fine.

1057
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,193
I'm abnormal, and you just want
the girl next door.

1058
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,111
Uh, you <i>are</i>
<i>the girl next door.</i>

1059
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,430
You know what I mean!

1060
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,039
Look, come back, please?

1061
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,599
- No, I have calculus.
- This is ridiculous.

1062
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,877
- Yeah, yeah, well, so do I.
- So, go to work.

1063
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,678
Look, don't you want me
to take you out on dates?

1064
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,113
You know, like, we'll...

1065
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,078
we'll sip ice cream sodas,
we'll have picnics in the park,

1066
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,115
that kind of thing?

1067
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,952
I mean, don't you want that?

1068
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,954
Shouldn't we have done that
before we had sex?

1069
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,680
I'm sorry. I don't...

1070
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,228
I mean... Ahem... I don't
know how to do this.

1071
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,834
L... l... I don't know
how to be a girlfriend.

1072
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,715
I'm not sure
I even wanna know how.

1073
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,191
Come here. Come here.
Get over here.

1074
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,992
What do you want?

1075
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,594
Uh, I want world peace.

1076
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,240
Oh, look, Sarcastic Man.

1077
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,072
Able to be a jerk
in a single bound.

1078
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,593
Yeah, bite me.

1079
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,640
No, no! Don't bite me!

1080
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,629
You're not gonna break me.

1081
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,472
I promise.

1082
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,431
Ohh.

1083
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,035
So you guys never did this
before on your Saturday nights?

1084
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,953
- Ohh... no.
- No?

1085
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,510
I don't know...
how much I believe you.

1086
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,670
Are we talking or spanking?

1087
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,678
We're spanking.

1088
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,392
Ow, fucker.
Everybody has to be into it.

1089
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,597
Not everybody likes
to get spanked, I guess.

1090
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,750
Do you?

1091
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,829
Ow! Stop.

1092
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,639
No. Look, put your fuckin'
hands down, okay?

1093
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,199
There's no hitting me,
you hear that?

1094
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,679
There's no hitting me.

1095
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,193
Oh, yeah?
We're making rules now?

1096
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,599
Yeah.

1097
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,671
I thought you'd like it
if we had rules.

1098
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,796
Don't you... Don't you have rules
in your little club?

1099
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,668
Stop calling it that.

1100
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,273
Well, what would you call it?

1101
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,191
They're my best friends.

1102
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,191
I've known them
since elementary school,

1103
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,236
and I love them.

1104
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,469
Why?

1105
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,198
Ow.

1106
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,628
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.

1107
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,756
It's your game, okay?

1108
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,158
You make it sound perverted
when you call it that.

1109
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,231
You don't think
it's perverted?

1110
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,868
No, I don't.

1111
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,400
I never worry, like about
if I'm pretty or sexy.

1112
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,950
Never worry about going
to parties or being alone...

1113
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,794
because I love them.

1114
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,156
- They're really cool people.
- Who you like to fuck.

1115
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,233
So? I like to sleep
with you, too.

1116
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,350
You're never gonna
make me feel like they do.

1117
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,271
So are those the only rules?

1118
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,559
Be honest.

1119
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,871
That's the other one.

1120
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,868
I guess you're breakin'
that one with me.

1121
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,028
Yeah.

1122
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,037
Come here.

1123
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,194
So were you lying?

1124
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,717
- When?
- When you said you loved me?

1125
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,234
- I never said that.
- But you do.

1126
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,512
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so say it then.

1127
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,038
I love you.

1128
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,398
Yeah?

1129
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,513
Say it back.

1130
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,194
- Maybe I will if, uh...
- No, you don't have to.

1131
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,032
I love you.

1132
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,119
I love you.

1133
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,151
This is where
we kiss now, right?

1134
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,031
<> I can't stand it,
I'm gonna explode <>

1135
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,351
<> My insides comin' out <>

1136
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:14,756
<> So what do I do now? <>

1137
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:24,191
<> So what do I do now? <>

1138
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:36,198
<> So what if
I don't know how? <>

1139
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,673
<> So what? <>

1140
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,519
<> So what? <>

1141
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,039
She won't do it, will she?

1142
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,189
Huh?

1143
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,589
What, are you thinking
of running away?

1144
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,113
How 'bout we play
the whole fantasy game

1145
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,553
Jonah was talking about?

1146
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,517
We'll hold you down.
We'll make you scream.

1147
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,555
Shut up, Billie.

1148
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,595
Hey, you have no idea

1149
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,829
what it means
if she leaves right now.

1150
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,592
- It doesn't mean anything.
- We're fine.

1151
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,829
- Stop being such a brat, huh?
- You can't force her.

1152
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,909
That's a rule.

1153
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,955
You can stop if you want.

1154
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,032
- Yeah, we can stop.
- No! We can't fucking stop!

1155
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,554
We don't stop!
We don't turn back!

1156
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,870
Hey, psycho, let me know
when Billie returns.

1157
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,871
Fuck you! Hey!

1158
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,589
Look at me, huh?
Look at me.

1159
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,557
Look at me.

1160
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,710
Look at you, okay?

1161
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,552
We are 17,

1162
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,551
and we are never gonna
look like this again.

1163
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,677
We want it.
Our bodies want it.

1164
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,079
I don't want it.

1165
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,275
Well, fuck you.

1166
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,112
- Billie, Billie!
- Fucking whore!

1167
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,792
- Fuckin' bitch!
- How original!

1168
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,869
All right. All right.

1169
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,552
Let's just break up the fight,
all right. It's a joke.

1170
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,915
You either do Jonah right now,
or you are so completely gone.

1171
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,194
- Do him?!
- Hold on!

1172
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,679
Do him? We don't
fucking do each other!

1173
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,715
Who the fuck are you?

1174
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,438
Hey! I'm not kidding!

1175
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,748
- Wait! Let's stop.
- I'm not kidding!

1176
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,795
Let's just stop.
Let's just stop.

1177
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,835
- Let's just stop.
- Shut up the fuck up, Ann!

1178
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,990
- Billie!
- Shut up. Huh?

1179
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,513
You gonna go crying
to your boyfriend,

1180
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,555
tell him how you
almost cheated on him?

1181
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,595
Shut up, Billie.

1182
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,715
- Hold on.
- What?

1183
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,870
- Boyfriend?
- Shut up.

1184
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,470
Run.

1185
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,913
Run!

1186
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,673
<> Pinned to the earth <>

1187
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,875
<> Like the scars <>

1188
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,269
<> On my hand,
aren't you, son? <>

1189
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,952
- Is that your boyfriend?
- Huh?

1190
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:43,995
Yes.

1191
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,274
Oh, look how cute and cuddly
you guys are together.

1192
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,349
Maybe you're thinking
about getting married

1193
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,715
and having kids,
or maybe you wanna have kids,

1194
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,791
and then get married
and get furniture together.

1195
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,519
- Shut the door.
- You know what is so fucked up?

1196
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,397
Nobody ever gets
to be <i>a girlfriend.</i>

1197
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,869
It's always <i>my girlfriend,</i>
<i>my car, my dog.</i>

1198
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,915
It <i>is my car.</i>

1199
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,116
You are just a barely
conscious amoeba

1200
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,872
just willing to give up
your own fucking individuality

1201
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,791
for a dick!

1202
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,313
Aah!

1203
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,837
I'd rather not have sex
again than be like you!

1204
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,831
...<> won't go <>

1205
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,916
<> The air weighs a ton <>

1206
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,790
<> What have we become now? <>

1207
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,194

01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,475
<> What have we done? <>

01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,028

01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,355

<> Fallin' down <>

1214
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,433
- Ahem...
- Uh, is, uh, Helen here?

1215
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,272
Uh...

1216
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,510
Could you just tell her that
Nathan's here with the salmon?

1217
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,591
Look, uh, this isn't
really a good time, all right?

1218
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,796
We're kind
of in the middle of somethin'.

1219
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,474
- What is that?
- It's a salmon with risotto.

1220
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,516
I promised Helen that
when I got it finished,

1221
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,192
I would bring it over
to her for her to try.

1222
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,838
If it's okay,
can I just come in and...

1223
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,070
- Okay, look, uh, Mason...
- Nathan.

1224
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,230
Nathan, could you either
just, uh, leave that here

1225
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,753
or, like,
leave a message, okay?

1226
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,159
Actually, if I could just...

1227
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,470
Look, I gotta get back
to her right now, all right?

1228
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,120
Go home. You can bring
your glazed whatever the...

1229
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,431
- Salmon.
- Salmon tomorrow, okay?

1230
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,748
Go home!

1231
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,955
Kid outside wants
to deliver a fish.

1232
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,758
You are such a shit.

1233
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,149
- What?
- He's a nice kid.

1234
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,591
Hmm.

1235
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,596
- Is this okay?
- Well, you tell me.

1236
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,194
I don't know. It's not too,
like, cute or something?

1237
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,953
- Okay, hold on for a second.
- What? Hey.

1238
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,634
How about this? How about
we lock down the premises here

1239
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,675
- to make sure nobody sees us
- Stop.

1240
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,318
- Holding hands, huh?
- Hey. Hey.

1241
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,039
This is hard for me, too.
Be nice.

1242
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,599
I <i>am nice.</i>

1243
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,672
Be nice.

1244
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,311
You're right.
You're right.

1245
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,029
I'll be nice, okay?
I'll be nice.

1246
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,869
It's just holding hands.

1247
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,639
- This is okay, I promise.
- All right.

1248
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,836
This... This is okay.

1249
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,399
What about this?

1250
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,517
This might be breaking
some rules, right?

1251
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,429
What?!

1252
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,959
I hate you.

1253
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,388
What?

1254
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,512
You left.

1255
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,150
Oh, God. Jesus.

1256
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,834
Stop, hey. You left.

1257
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,512
Now's not the time
to push people away.

1258
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,036
Really?
What is it the time for, Ryan?

1259
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,032
You know what?
You're lucky.

1260
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,875
See, when I left,
I only had Aaron.

1261
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,748
You've got me and Aaron...
and Sean.

1262
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,512
Lucky me.

1263
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,875
- I knew you'd leave.
- Mmm.

1264
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,393
You don't know shit.

1265
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,996
- Wendy.
- What?

1266
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,991
You sound ridiculous
when you swear.

1267
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,910
What's up
with your slut clogs?

1268
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,557
Aaron loves sluts.

1269
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,077
I like doing
nice things for him.

1270
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,597
Why did you quit amnesty...
and student government?

1271
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,749
Billie.

1272
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,669
- Yeah, so you quit.
- Yeah.

1273
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,232
Sean's great.

1274
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,839
Hey.

1275
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,879
Hey.

1276
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,833
You look nice.

1277
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,353
Thanks.

1278
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,512
Are you okay?

1279
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,834
Yeah.

1280
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,876
He didn't put some sort
of voodoo spell on you, did he?

1281
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,838
- No.
- Good.

1282
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,077
Hey, you know...

1283
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,153
I wanted to leave once,
before Ryan and Aaron even.

1284
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,592
Why didn't you?

1285
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,314
Too chicken, I guess.

1286
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,872
Was it for another guy?

1287
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,631
Yeah.

1288
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,759
Anyway, I just...

1289
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,753
I just wanted to tell you
that I was proud of you.

1290
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,798
You know what? It was brave.

1291
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,917
Stupid, but brave.

1292
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,277
I wish I could have done it,
but... whatever.

1293
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,878
I got to tell you,
though, if I left,

1294
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,428
I'd make sure to destroy
it all on my way out.

1295
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,958
You know, like scorched earth,
American G.I. Style.

1296
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,313
If you leave
the enemy resources,

1297
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,358
uh... they'll use them.

1298
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,599
Billie took your box.
I'm sorry.

1299
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,113
I'll see you.

1300
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:53,111
Your friends... all of us...
we don't wanna let you go,

1301
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,430
and we won't do it.

1302
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,271
What if I want to?

1303
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,950
If you were a mother and your
kid was about to lose a limb...

1304
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,837
I don't know.

1305
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,388
Wouldn't you maybe
fight to keep it?

1306
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,834
That's not really
the same thing.

1307
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,035
Oh, well, we feel it is.

1308
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,473
Oh, are you speaking
for everyone now?

1309
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,039
- Yeah.
- Mm-Hmm.

1310
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,112
- I don't believe you.
- Sorry.

1311
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,792
This is you terrified...

1312
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,996
alone...

1313
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,355
and you have no idea
what to do.

1314
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,749
He wants me,
and that kills you.

1315
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,518
Not so far.

1316
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,431
I'm not the box, Billie.
You are.

1317
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,073
You're a sad, pathetic...

1318
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,199
limited, little box.

1319
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,153
Hello!

1320
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,798
Hi.

1321
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,876
Oh, yeah, God forbid
your kiddie porn gets ruined.

1322
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,188
That's not what's in here.

1323
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,396
No. It's all puppies
and "I love unicorns"

1324
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,515
and tapioca pudding.

1325
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,068
- It's not porn. It's just...
- They made you do it, right?

1326
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,917
Screw you.

1327
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,156
I don't know
how to do this.

1328
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,515
I mean, what do we do now?
We fight? What do we do?

1329
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,989
You don't get to be the innocent
little girl, not after...

1330
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,470
- Uch!
- Uch, what? What, this?

1331
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,711
What, this stuff?
This is real. This happened.

1332
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,031
What are you so afraid of?

1333
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,271
What, you just want me to
magically become a virgin again?

1334
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,590
- Yes.
- You're not fuckin' serious.

1335
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,752
I want you to burn it, okay?
I want you to burn that box.

1336
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,149
- You're delusional.
- I mean, does this...

1337
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,277
Does any of this have
any value to you?

1338
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,672
Lmagine all the memories
that you've ever had,

1339
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:58,230
all the embarrassing, funny,
great moments with a girlfriend,

1340
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,118
without whatever,
fucking by yourself.

1341
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,475
Imagine it all in one place.
Now you burn it.

1342
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,869
I would.

1343
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,878
Don't be average.

1344
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,910
It's not different.

1345
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,359
Either you're in this with me,
or you're not.

1346
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,590
But I showed up.

1347
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,558
I am not a new me, okay?

1348
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,358
I'm not new now
just because you met me!

1349
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,396
Okay, fine. Fine.

1350
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,755
You could really forget
about everything, huh?

1351
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,274
You could forget everything
if I just burned that box?

1352
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,315
Yes.

1353
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,435
That I was
ever somebody different.

1354
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,839
Yes, I would.

1355
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,394
And if you could just stop
reminding me of it every day.

1356
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,789
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1357
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,235
I miss her.

1358
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,154
Fuck her!
Are you crying?

1359
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,992
Yeah, fuck you, too!

1360
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,391
Fuck you, Billie...

1361
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,232
you manipulative bitch.

1362
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,833
Fuck you.

1363
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,954
So you're gonna come
on Saturday, huh?

1364
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,553
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1365
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,552
Do you remember what you're
saying yes to? No. Do you?

1366
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,039
Well... we're having dinner
with my parents.

1367
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,509
Where's
your little group now?

1368
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,158
Whore!

1369
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,515
You're gonna
do it tonight, right?

1370
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,670
Wendy, you're gonna
burn the box, right?

1371
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,594
- What?
- Get out, Billie!

1372
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,152
Damn slut!

1373
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,674
Roll on out, Billie!

1374
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,958
- Aww!
- Oh, poor Billie!

1375
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,672
- I have to see if she's okay.
- No, come on.

1376
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,716
Please don't go.
Don't go to her.

1377
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,155
I'm not gonna burn it.

1378
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,229
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry
for what happened.

1379
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,275
Okay, just keep...
Keep your voice down!

1380
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,033
I am not gonna apologize!

1381
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,759
I just gave up five of the best
people in the world for you!

1382
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,353
Yeah, five people
who you slept with!

1383
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,192
So what?!

1384
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,919
So what?!
They meant something to me!

1385
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,952
I'm just... I just walked out
and destroyed my life

1386
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,439
and walked away for this?!

1387
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,671
This is me, okay?
I'm offering you me.

1388
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,796
Me in exchange
for the five of them, okay?

1389
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,518
That's what I'm offering you.

1390
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,068
This...

1391
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,277
This is
a fairy tale, okay?

1392
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,474
That's what this is.

1393
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,788
W-Wendy...

1394
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,310
You don't want me
as a girlfriend.

1395
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,870
You remember
Miss Hise's class?

1396
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,151
We tortured
her daughter, Greer.

1397
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,515
Well, she carried
these book bags.

1398
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,512
Oh, she smelled
fucking terrible.

1399
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,591
I totally remember that.

1400
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,476
And then in, like,
the third grade...

1401
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,438
What? I decided
to do this dance,

1402
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,114
remember, when
my parents split up?

1403
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,760
- Like that movie, <i>Flashdance?</i>
- <i>We saw that on cable.</i>

1404
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,115
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1405
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,519
And I can see it.
I see.

1406
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,874
I can see
little third grade me,

1407
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,872
like getting up there
to do the dance.

1408
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,552
I wanna tell her to stop,
and I can't.

1409
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,997
I am so embarrassed
just even thinking about it.

1410
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,269
Yeah.

1411
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,031
Hey, your friends,
all of us...

1412
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,153
I...

1413
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,471
I don't want to let you go.

1414
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,275
I love you.

1415
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,319
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah.

1416
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,036
Hug me, bitch.

1417
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,751
He wants me to burn the box.

1418
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,628
Of course, because then he could
pretend like you're a virgin,

1419
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,678
and then he'd be
the conquering hero.

1420
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,957
What's so heroic
about conquering a labia?

1421
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,598
Labia?

1422
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,069
What, you mean like vag'?

1423
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,754
"Vag'." I hate that word.

1424
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,554
Hey, you totally, like,
know that we're like...

1425
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,835
two of the most awesomest people
in school, right?

1426
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,797
Yeah, we're so the awesomest.

1427
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,871
And you do know

1428
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,872
that he's not gonna let you
or your labia go, right?

1429
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,951
- If he asks, I'll just say no.
- Or you say yes,

1430
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,598
and you end up shitting
all over this family again.

1431
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,194
It's not gonna happen.

1432
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,395
It's not.

1433
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,835
Look, just saying it twice
isn't gonna make it true.

1434
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,753
You have to make it impossible
for him to ask.

1435
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,432
You have to go in there
and show him the worst in you,

1436
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,158
so he knows it's over.

1437
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,879
Yeah, scorched earth, huh?

1438
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,391
Hi.

1439
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,633
We're scaring you.

1440
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,280
- You're disturbing us, Billie.
- Oh, gosh, we're sorry.

1441
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,509
Do it.

1442
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,030
Did she ever tell you
where the scar came from?

1443
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,078
All the girls know about it,
but the guys didn't.

1444
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,388
Didn't know about Uncle Bob.

1445
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,789
I believe it was
"Dear, old Uncle Bob."

1446
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,634
And that, what,
he smelled like Aqua Velva

1447
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,790
and tasted like Doritos?

1448
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,633
And that dear, old Uncle Bob,
well, he liked to touch you.

1449
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,676
Shut up.

1450
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,955
- Bitches.
- Billie, let's go.

1451
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,076
Ryan here...

1452
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,991
she liked it.

1453
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,675
What, um...
it made her feel all...

1454
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,876
How did it
make her feel, Wendy?

1455
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,073
Hot.

1456
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,554
- Hot?
- What about, um...

1457
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:48,512
What about gang rape, huh?
We used to play gang rape.

1458
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,114
That wasn't me.

1459
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,112
We used to pretend
like we were firemen?

1460
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:58,512
Or how you used to cut yourself
with an exacto blade?

1461
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,794
You thought you were a vampire

1462
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,995
all the way
through eighth grade.

1463
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,035
Stop!

1464
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,475
How about the fact
that Jonah and Robert

1465
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,996
had been sleeping together
for three years, huh?

1466
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,314
Or how Ann's mother used
to tie her hands together

1467
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,391
so she wouldn't
touch herself anymore?

1468
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,994
Or how I pissed all over
myself at that spelling bee

1469
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,196
in third grade?

1470
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,078
Or how Aaron puked when
you got your period in fifth?

1471
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:25,199
What about the fact that Price
cheated on us at spring break

1472
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,635
and gave everyone crabs?

1473
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,393
How about that?

1474
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:35,475
Yeah, we're
a fucking awesome family!

1475
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,633
You can burn the box.

1476
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,797
I don't need it anymore.
