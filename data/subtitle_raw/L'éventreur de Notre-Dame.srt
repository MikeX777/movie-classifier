00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,610
(organ music)

2
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,606
(whip cracking)

3
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,025
(groaning)

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,979
(shouting)

5
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,191
(screaming)

6
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,388
(clanking)

7
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,450
(indistinct chatter)

8
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,942
(shouting)

9
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,755
(groaning)

10
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,519
No!

11
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,149
(gulping)

12
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,138
You’re a monster.

13
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,349
The devil has possessed you.

14
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,270
(grunting)

15
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,024
No!

16
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,443
(shouting)

17
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,880
(groaning)

18
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,593
My sweet, my darling,
I love you.

19
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,846
Let my love unite our souls.

20
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,265
(groaning)

21
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,810
Don’t resist.

22
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,063
Open your heart to me.

23
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,482
(groaning)

24
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,508
(groaning continues)

25
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,225
(shouting)

26
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,479
(groaning)

27
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,576
(laughing, applause)

28
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,995
(indistinct chatter)

29
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,796
(soft music)

30
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,828
(music stopping)

31
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,963
Okay, Charlie, hold everything
for the front page, will you?

32
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,924
Got that? Good.

33
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:56,012
-How’s my favorite boss?
-Fine, Anna.

34
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,600
-Here’s the mail.
-Ah, thank you.

35
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,729
How did you like
the performance last night?

36
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,940
I am a great actress.

37
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,150
-You’re a what?
-I’ve got talent.

38
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,487
Talent? What matters to me
is the box office tape.

39
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,156
Oh, in that case,
you should be very happy

40
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,742
because we had
a hell of a crowd.

41
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,706
-Excuse me.
-Okay, come on in.

42
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,544
-Good morning, Raymond.
-Hello, Vogel.

43
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,420
-Good morning, young lady.
-Morning, sir.

44
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,506
Here’s the story you wanted
for the next issue

45
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,092
-of your magazine.
-That’s fine.

46
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,176
Very interesting,

47
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,136
the torture chambers
of the Inquisition.

48
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,305
Huh, it’s got punch.

49
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,683
The storyline is not so hot,
but all of the details

50
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,976
are absolutely authentic

51
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,770
and some of them
are quite extraordinary.

52
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,816
My dear Vogel, your humility
as a writer is very touching,

53
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,569
but you know as well as I do
that our readers eat up

54
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,946
those sadomasochistic stories
of yours.

55
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,657
Oh, I don’t invent anything.

56
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,493
It’s all based on
real-life experience,

57
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,662
not my personal experience.

58
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,163
Really?

59
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,417
You’re a man of science,
Mr. Vogel.

60
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,628
We must know evil
to be able to fight it.

61
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,925
They tell me you used to be
a priest once.

62
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,719
Some people will say anything.

63
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,096
Tell me, Vogel, my friend,

64
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,348
are you an unfrocked priest
or not?

65
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,142
What difference does it make?

66
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,227
Well, it’s an interesting angle.

67
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,146
We could publish a serial:

68
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,649
Memoirs of an Unfrocked Priest.

69
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,110
We could try it.

70
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,487
I’ll let you know.

71
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,364
Anyway, I’ll drop in soon.

72
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,782
-All right.
-Goodbye.

73
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,494
A pleasure. Goodbye, Mr. Vogel.

74
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,331
Goodbye, Miss Anna.

75
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,874
Hmm...

76
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,136
(laughing)

77
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,930
He really is a weirdy.

78
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,807
He scares the pants off me.

79
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,977
Don’t be silly,
he’s perfectly harmless.

80
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,358
It’s nothing
but a literary pose.

81
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,485
How about a nice little kiss?

82
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,904
(moaning)

83
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,783
I’m going to scare you, yeah.

84
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,368
We’ll organize
a real Black Mass.

85
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,869
-Really?
-Really.

86
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,747
-We’ll conjure up the devil.
-My god.

87
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,832
(moaning)

88
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,168
That’s right, we’re going
to be needing a girl

89
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,544
for the sacrificial victim.

90
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,755
How exciting.

91
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,800
Mrs. Cartier will be
the celebrant.

92
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,136
And I’ll go and find a victim
at the Beelzebub Club.

93
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,097
-Not coming to my place?
-Not now.

94
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,391
Bad boy, you’re so cruel.

95
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,893
(moaning)

96
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,020
(organ music)

97
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,607
-Oh, please.
-No, not here.

98
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,652
Yeah, come to my place.

99
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,279
Oh, come on.

100
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,828
Oh, come on, please.

101
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,870
Huh?

102
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,289
(giggling)

103
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,044
(owl hooting)

104
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,014
(clicking)

105
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,440
(indistinct chatter)

106
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,294
Ah, Rose! Hello.

107
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,462
Hello.

108
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,883
-You’re late.
-Oh, I’ve got news for you.

109
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,551
-What is it?
-We’ve got to find

110
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,386
a sacrifice victim
for Saturday.

111
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,013
Why do we need somebody else?

112
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,391
It’s for a real Black Mass.

113
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,727
-How about the crypt?
-Oh, the crypt is a good idea.

114
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,646
Marina will be there,
maybe we can talk her into it.

115
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,815
Okay.

116
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,024
Speed up and come on.

117
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,235
Be right with you.

118
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,374
(funky music)

119
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,581
-Hi!
-Hi!

120
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,585
This Black Mass...

121
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,794
-How are you?
-Hi, Ray.

122
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,671
What the hell
is a Black Mass anyway?

123
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,591
-Hi, honey. Hi!
-Oh, well, it’s a lot of fun

124
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,050
and all that, you know.

125
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,803
You go through the motions
of a Black Mass.

126
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,471
There’s lots of millionaires,
it ends in a gangbang.

127
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,098
-Rich girls too?
-Plenty.

128
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,516
There’s something
for every taste,

129
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,143
and they are all rich.

130
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,312
You can count on
making a bundle.

131
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,856
Oh, and what exactly
am I supposed to do?

132
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,150
Oh! Nothing special.

133
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,610
Just make it.

134
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,987
Only make it with who? Anybody?

135
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,032
-You could always try Raymond.
-Aw!

136
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,743
If you prefer,
you can get yourself a girl.

137
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,786
There’s no shortage
of naked women.

138
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,705
(laughing)

139
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,792
-Coming?
-Uh...

140
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,212
I wouldn’t miss it
for anything.

141
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,130
Okay, then it’s settled.

142
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,634
To us. Cheers!

143
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,395
(music stopping)

144
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,152
(birds chirping)

145
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,031
(organ and guitar music)

146
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,084
(barking)

147
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,669
"Apartments for rent."

148
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,972
(music stopping)

149
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,145
-Uh, how do you do?
-Yes, sir?

150
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,856
Do you have an apartment
available?

151
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,025
Yes, sir, I do.

152
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,737
An apartment
overlooking the street?

153
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,323
Yes, I think so, sir.

154
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,452
Thank you. In that case,
I’ll take it.

155
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,579
Very well, sir.

156
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,126
-Your name, please?
-Mathis Daniel.

157
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,253
Mathis Daniel.

158
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,091
(soft music)

159
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,689
(sighing)

160
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,899
Ooh, I’m worn out.

161
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,692
Typical.

162
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,861
You’re always tired.

163
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,449
Too lazy even to hang up
your things.

164
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,453
It’s resting
that keeps me young.

165
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,833
How can you live
in a mess like this?

166
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,211
Anyhow, that way
I can find everything.

167
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,796
Very funny.

168
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,347
(guitar music)

169
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,734
Can I give you a hand?

170
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,159
(chuckles)

171
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,287
Here, catch.

172
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,914
Oopla.

173
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,292
Now what?

174
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,054
(giggling)

175
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,722
-Let’s make love.
-Why not?

176
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,849
(laughing)

177
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,686
-Let’s rehearse for Saturday.
-The Black Mass, yes.

178
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,855
Our own show.

179
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,026
So, how will we do it?

180
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,861
Ooh, tell me, Anna.

181
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,114
You’ll be the young lover.

182
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,492
I’ll be the shy virgin.

183
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,663
You’ll wear a long, black cloak.

184
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,665
I’ll be carrying
a concealed dagger

185
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,084
to protect my virtue,
so watch out.

186
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,837
You’re going to need more
than a dagger.

187
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,172
Prove it.

188
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,841
I surrender.

189
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:27,596
And I’ll take my dagger
and caress you very gently.

190
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,101
Stroke you with it gently,

191
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,562
just enough not to break
the skin.

192
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,815
And when you are trembling
with excitement,

193
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,941
I’ll kill you!

194
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,151
(laughing)

195
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,873
(music stopping)

196
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,297
I could use a drink.

197
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,174
I’ll join you.

198
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,762
Oh, hell, another customer.

199
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,812
Good evening. I hope
I’m not too late to be served.

200
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,564
That’s all right, sir.
What’ll you have?

201
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,691
-Scotch.
-Right away.

202
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,862
Any particular brand?

203
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,781
Uh, no.

204
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,452
Buy me a drink?

205
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,536
If you like.

206
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,663
Take what you want.

207
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,665
Marina, another Scotch.

208
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,500
What are you doing out so late?

209
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,044
I can’t stand crowded places.

210
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,129
It’s sad to be alone.

211
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,800
Everything is sad.

212
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,135
This place,
was it a church once?

213
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,513
Who cares what it was?

214
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,348
Yes, who cares?

215
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,433
Here’s to churches.

216
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,651
Look, would you mind
coming with me?

217
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,779
-Where to?
-My place.

218
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,614
Gonna be nice to me?

219
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,867
Yes, very nice to you.

220
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,869
Do you live nearby?

221
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,748
Nearby.

222
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,379
Let’s go, there’s no time
to lose.

223
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,257
I’ll just slip into my clothes.

224
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,435
(howling)

225
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,854
(organ music)

226
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,743
Quite a place you’ve got here.

227
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,287
It serves my purpose.

228
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,206
-Come on.
-Hey, what’s the big hurry?

229
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,002
Ah, yes.

230
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,263
Make yourself at home.

231
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,682
(sighing)

232
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,656
(music stopping)

233
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,913
(speaking Latin)

234
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,254
(soft moaning)

235
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,050
(clears throat)

236
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,513
Where did you go?

237
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,140
-Where were you?
-I was praying.

238
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,269
I pray before anything I do.

239
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,815
I have a private chapel.

240
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,274
Chapel?

241
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,401
Yes, I have a chapel
in my house.

242
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,238
What’s strange about that?

243
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,864
Oh?

244
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,407
Nothing, I guess.

245
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,953
Only you don’t usually find them
in places I go.

246
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,871
I’m not surprised,
you’re a whore.

247
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,665
Hey, go easy.

248
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,210
I bet you don’t find
many honest, God-fearing men

249
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,920
among the customers
you associate with.

250
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,463
That’s not true.

251
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,008
One of my customers
once took me to a mass.

252
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,219
So piety is not dead yet?

253
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,681
It’s not what you think.

254
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,516
It was a Black Mass.

255
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,309
A Black Mass?

256
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,896
Yes, it was
an exciting evening.

257
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,401
How many times have you been?

258
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,070
Not often, a couple of times.

259
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,614
It’s a pretty weird experience.

260
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,868
Where was it?

261
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,328
In Paris,
in some cave or other.

262
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,206
-Give me the address.
-I don’t remember.

263
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,291
Now come on.

264
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,793
Don’t keep a lady waiting.

265
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,378
So you’re in a hurry.

266
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,630
No, but if you want me to stay,

267
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,382
we ought to talk
a little business.

268
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,593
Ouch.

269
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,177
I’ll pay.

270
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,933
If you like, I’ll stay with you
until tomorrow.

271
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,685
I do like.

272
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,565
Yes, you’ve got to stay here.

273
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,776
What are you doing?

274
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,364
Take off your clothes.

275
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,619
Take off your clothes!

276
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,745
You hear?

277
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,247
Take off your clothes.

278
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,181
Who took you to the Black Mass?

279
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,099
-Tell me.
-Just friends, that’s all.

280
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,476
Yes, friends, friends.

281
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,478
-What friends?
-Some of my friends

282
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,313
who come to the discotheque.

283
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,773
The discotheque. Which?

284
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,983
You know it,
it’s the one in a cave.

285
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,485
Yes, their names, their names.

286
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,321
-There’s Raymond.
-Raymond. Who else?

287
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,114
-Anna.
-Anna. Who else?

288
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,741
-And Paulie.
-Who else?

289
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,077
I want all the names.

290
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,245
Stop it, you’re hurting me!

291
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,247
You’ve got to tell me
the names!

292
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,291
I want to know all the names!

293
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,627
Tell me!

294
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,337
Tell me.

295
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,174
I’ve got to know.

296
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,453
(guitar music)

297
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,560
(music stopping)

298
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,838
You must kiss this cross.

299
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,381
Kiss this cross.

300
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,676
Kiss it if you want
to save your soul.

301
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,844
Repeat after me:

302
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,346
I am possessed by the devil.

303
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,684
Repeat after me:

304
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,853
I am possessed by the devil.

305
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,480
You are possessed by the devil!

306
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,565
I know you are.

307
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,860
-I’m going to exorcise you.
-You’re crazy.

308
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,989
All right, it’s true,
I’m possessed by the devil.

309
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,409
Confess that the devil
is ruling you

310
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,827
in heart, mind, and body.

311
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,287
In heart, mind, and body,

312
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,831
confess, child,
confess to Heaven.

313
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,084
-Confess.
-I confess

314
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:20,003
that the devil rules me
in heart, mind, and body.

315
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,713
Swear it!

316
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,507
Yes.

317
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,051
That’s good.

318
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,095
Now repeat: Humbly,
I accept the punishment

319
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:32,682
for my greatest offense
and my wicked transgressions.

320
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,228
-Repeat it.
-Please!

321
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,271
Go on!

322
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,148
Repent.

323
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,112
Repent!

324
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,169
(gasping)

325
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,220
(speaking Latin)

326
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,061
Amen.

327
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,398
Your excoriation
will now begin.

328
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,817
(gasping)

329
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,701
(moaning)

330
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,457
Ah.

331
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,551
(whimpering)

332
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,518
(singing in Latin)

333
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,073
(clanking)

334
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,086
(clanking continues)

335
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,050
(gasping)

336
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,120
I will save you.

337
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,511
(singing in Latin)

338
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,417
You are possessed by the devil.

339
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,503
You are an instrument
of hellfire, of damnation,

340
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,298
and the wages of sin is death.

341
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,301
I am all too familiar with sin.

342
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,720
I used to be a priest formerly.

343
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,096
I was expelled
from the priesthood.

344
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,265
Those idiots thought
I was too severe.

345
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,017
They were wrong!

346
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,144
My heart was pure and just,

347
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,814
and--and intransigent
in dealing with sin.

348
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,485
I fought with sin,
I fought with vice.

349
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,322
That’s why I will exorcise you

350
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:19,200
and tear the devil
out of your heart.

351
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,785
You’re going to die,

352
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,748
but your soul will mount
to the joys of paradise.

353
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,249
Out, Satan.

354
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,293
(gasping)

355
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,172
(music starting)

356
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,054
(speaking Latin)

357
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,616
(squawking)

358
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,670
(pattering)

359
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,016
(music stopping)

360
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,394
Good evening.

361
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,853
Good evening, Your Lordship.

362
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,106
Your guests are awaiting you.

363
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,440
Thank you.

364
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,736
(moody music)

365
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,125
-Good evening.
-Happy to see you.

366
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,709
Please step in the salon.

367
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,087
Oh, my friends,
I’m so glad you could come.

368
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,256
-How nice of you to ask us.
-This is a pleasure.

369
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,591
-Good evening, Count.
-Good evening.

370
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,051
Good evening.

371
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,719
Oh, I was wondering
if you would make it.

372
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,971
We wouldn’t have missed this
for anything.

373
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,681
Hello!

374
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,850
Oh, you look wonderful.

375
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,643
Hello, how are you?

376
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,311
Oh, this will be
a great evening.

377
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,522
-Yes.
-Yeah.

378
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,108
Come, Satan.

379
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:18,111
(drum music)

380
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,530
(heavy breathing)

381
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,795
The Black Mass has begun.

382
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,094
Come, mighty, all-powerful
king of darkness.

383
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,515
Pray, accept the sacrifice
we humbly offer.

384
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,809
Your chosen one
is awaiting you.

385
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,397
Your faithful offer her to you
as a sign of their devotion.

386
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,699
(owl hooting)

387
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,254
(organ music)

388
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:22,008
Admit the devil
into your hearts,

389
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,470
your minds, your bodies.

390
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,305
Come, Abaddon.

391
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,849
Come, oh, father of lies.

392
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,268
(speaking Latin)

393
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,257
(shouting)

394
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,928
(whip cracking, shouting)

395
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:17,146
Spirit of Hell, enter into us.

396
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,359
Oh, Satan,

397
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,697
fill us with your evil power.

398
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,950
You will bring
the sweetness to sin.

399
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:34,038
You, our master,
help us to tread

400
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,709
the path of luxury and vice.

401
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:44,716
Oh, Prince of Hades,

402
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,511
come, our beloved lord.

403
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,099
We pay you homage.

404
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,350
We are your slaves.

405
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,019
We worship you
more than the moon

406
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,646
and more than the fires
of the sun.

407
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,108
Satan!

408
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,527
Accept the sacrifice
that we offer you,

409
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,865
and may her blood flow free
into the ritual vessel.

410
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,161
(speaking Latin)

411
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,792
Priestess of the devil,
I raise up this dagger

412
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,796
that is now the instrument
of your design.

413
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,093
Come to me, Prince of Hell,

414
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:33,473
and give me the strength
to accomplish your sacrifice.

415
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,647
Accept your chosen one.

416
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,441
Accept your bride

417
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:48,196
whose blood shall flow
in honor of your might.

418
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:56,454
Satan, we worship you.

419
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,510
No.

420
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,015
(screaming)

421
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,678
(music stopping)

422
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:42,101
My dear friends, I’m delighted
to present Marina,

423
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,980
our victim, who played her part
to perfection.

424
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,399
(applause)

425
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,904
And this is the dagger.

426
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,322
Mm-hm.

427
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,076
And, now...

428
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,746
...for the second stage.

429
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,917
(moody music)

430
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,544
(moaning, laughing)

431
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,423
Oh, baby, you really know
how to do it.

432
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,842
(groaning)

433
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,471
Ah!

434
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,607
(groaning)

435
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,327
(groaning)

436
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,579
(indistinct chatter)

437
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,131
(laughing)

438
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,052
(groaning)

439
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,307
(grunting)

440
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,239
Hey, Louise, she’s very nice.

441
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,541
(groaning)

442
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,843
Enjoy yourself.

443
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,137
Let the pleasure reign.

444
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,018
Come on.

445
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,189
Let’s see some action.

446
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,614
Mmm.

447
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,912
Oh, babe.

448
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,597
(groaning)

449
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,309
(indistinct chatter)

450
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,033
(laughing)

451
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,374
Hey. Hey!

452
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,251
Ooh.

453
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,227
(groaning)

454
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,492
(groaning)

455
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,881
(groaning)

456
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,300
(music stopping)

457
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,226
(engine puttering)

458
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,953
(humming)

459
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,505
So, how did you enjoy yourself?

460
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,299
Just a nice party,
nothing special.

461
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,009
Nothing special?

462
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,346
You were making it with
just about anything in sight.

463
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,434
Aw. Oof.

464
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,522
Well, it’s the only way
to have fun or it’s a bore.

465
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,404
Don’t be angry, darling.

466
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,281
You’re the man
I’m in love with.

467
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,574
Yes, I know that,

468
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,618
only I find it hard
to understand.

469
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,412
Oh well, I guess it’s just
our difference in age.

470
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,164
Oh, but that’s no reason
to be jealous.

471
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,041
I don’t like feeling ridiculous.

472
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,960
Aww.

473
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,639
You sometimes get
the funniest ideas.

474
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,351
You’re a fine-looking man.

475
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,021
Your jealousy is flattering,
as a matter of fact.

476
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,860
It’s not jealousy.

477
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,488
It’s simply that I don’t like
those people.

478
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,575
That’s the last time we go
to one of those parties.

479
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,661
Aww.

480
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,051
(door opening quietly)

481
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,967
(grunting and struggling)

482
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,965
(gasping)

483
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,718
-David, help!
-I’ll save your soul.

484
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:36,802
Who are you?

485
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,263
You are an instrument
of the Devil.

486
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:43,183
You’re in danger of Hell.

487
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,184
I will save you.

488
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,394
-I’ll exorcise you.
-No!

489
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,062
-Let me go!
-You must pay for your sins.

490
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,981
-You must be crazy!
-But you aren’t going to

491
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,692
die in a state of grace.

492
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,569
I shall purify your soul.

493
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,029
Repent, my child!

494
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,991
Repent, and you will be saved.

495
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,409
(gasping)

496
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,543
(breathing shakily)

497
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,717
(grunting)

498
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,808
(breathing shakily)

499
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,355
Out,

500
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,733
Satan!

501
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,151
There.

502
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,876
In nomine Patris!

503
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,254
Et Filii!

504
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,382
(breathing heavily)

505
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,768
(knife clicking)

506
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,525
(dreadful music)

507
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,696
(indistinct whispering)

508
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,116
(dreadful music)

509
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,969
-Good morning.
-Good morning, inspector.

510
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,303
I’m all through here.

511
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,264
-What a mess!
-You’ve done your work,

512
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,057
but my work’s just beginning,

513
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,476
-I’m afraid.
-Who is that young man with you?

514
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,855
He’s my new assistant,
only, if you ask me--

515
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,565
Oh.

516
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,692
Find anything
interesting, doctor?

517
00:53:56,692 --> 00:54:00,028
Doesn’t have the appearance
of the usual sex crime.

518
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,781
So, we are not dealing
with a sex maniac.

519
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,201
-How ’bout the weapon?
-A thin-bladed knife,

520
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,579
blade about seven inches long.

521
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,540
Disemboweled the woman,
stabbed the husband.

522
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,917
-A real massacre!
-A sadist.

523
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,712
It could be,
but maybe a vendetta.

524
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,088
Or a nut!

525
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,550
Well, in my opinion, it was
neither one nor the other.

526
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,636
Something here strikes me
as very interesting.

527
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,806
The form of the wounds
and the depth of the incisions,

528
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,516
everything seems to point

529
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,394
to the exorcism ritual
of the early Inquisition.

530
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,480
So you believe that our assassin

531
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,440
is Torquemada?

532
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,901
Could be a Torquemada
of the present day.

533
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,487
According to the theories
of Flange and Obermeier,

534
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:44,698
our technological age leads to
a return to superstition.

535
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,908
Oh, now, please, Malou,

536
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,367
cut out the flights
of imagination

537
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,746
and concentrate on conducting
this investigation properly.

538
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,123
Well, inspector,
one of our men spotted somebody,

539
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,501
a suspicious character
hangin’ around.

540
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,252
My friend, your grand inquisitor

541
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,838
is probably nothing
but a cheap sneak thief

542
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,465
who got in a panic.

543
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,057
Is this the guy?

544
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,683
Yes, inspector.

545
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,060
Your name?

546
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,437
They call me Meathead.

547
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,064
Take off your cap.

548
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,733
-No, I won’t.
-I said take it off!

549
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,654
You pay the hospital
if I get pneumonia.

550
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,948
Okay, so what’s your name?

551
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,866
Meathead.

552
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,826
I want your real name.

553
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,538
(indistinct foreign name)

554
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,249
But for convenience,
they call me Meathead.

555
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,708
-So what’s your story?
-Nothing.

556
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,461
You were hanging around
that hotel there, what for?

557
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,421
Who, me?

558
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,341
-I was fermenting.
-What?

559
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,425
Don’t you talk English?

560
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:49,388
I was sleeping off a hangover!

561
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,390
Look, we didn’t get you
in here because of that,

562
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,350
but because you were
carrying a knife.

563
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,351
Oh!

564
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,230
A tiny little knife
for peeling bananas.

565
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,400
Look, we know
you’ve got a record.

566
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,985
They seem to like pulling me in,

567
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:06,071
but I never harm
nobody in my life.

568
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,740
I’m an angel with
a deadly face, that’s all.

569
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,326
Just the finger of fate.

570
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,370
(sighing)

571
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,454
Well, Meathead,

572
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,873
fate’s really got you this time.

573
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,877
All right, then, angel,

574
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,838
you’re gonna be
our guest once more.

575
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,298
You’re going to try and explain

576
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,758
just how you didn’t
murder the Cartiers,

577
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,469
you get me?

578
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,055
-Take him away.
-Let’s go.

579
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,099
It’s monotonous.

580
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,647
Pardon me, inspector,

581
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,566
but do you really believe that

582
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,859
that man’s the criminal?

583
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,736
Now, listen,

584
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,488
you college theorists would
think I’m making a mistake

585
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,407
in holding Mr. Meathead,

586
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,201
but I’ve got to hold somebody,
innocent or guilty,

587
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,953
so that I’ll be left in peace

588
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,747
to find the real criminal.

589
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,166
(easygoing music)

590
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,494
(moaning)

591
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,842
(groaning)

592
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,012
(gasping)

593
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,520
Oh.

594
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,939
(deranged music)

595
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,624
Anybody home?

596
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,292
Doesn’t look like it.

597
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,044
(deranged music)

598
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,421
You there, Rose?

599
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,881
We’re in the bathtub.

600
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,717
Let’s get comfortable.

601
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,136
(giggling)

602
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,015
(deranged music)

603
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,244
(laughing)

604
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,454
Hi, fellas.

605
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,663
Hi there, Rose.

606
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,498
-Hello.
-Hi!

607
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,041
Don’t mind us.

608
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,961
-Make yourselves at home.
-Oh!

609
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,380
(deranged music)

610
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,926
(giggling)

611
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,136
What brings you here?

612
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,221
We came to get Raymond.

613
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,473
He’s not here.

614
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,433
He’s with the police.

615
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,519
It’s not important,
anyway, I’m busy now.

616
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,938
(deranged music)

617
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,734
(moaning)

618
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,153
(deranged music)

619
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,875
(moaning and giggling)

620
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,256
No.

621
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,675
(deranged music)

622
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:05,018
Why don’t you
take off your robe?

623
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,937
(indistinct speaking)

624
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:07,938
Your name?

625
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,397
Raymond Franval.

626
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,774
Occupation?

627
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,235
I am the Director
of Venus Publications

628
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,695
and of the Dagger
and Garter Weekly.

629
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,073
Ah, a purveyor of culture.

630
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,866
Are you one of
my readers, perhaps?

631
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,368
No.

632
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,203
I hardly have
the time to even read

633
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,080
the sport page in the Figaro.

634
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,749
Ah, yes, well,
I see what you mean.

635
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:31,461
My magazine wouldn’t exactly
be up your street.

636
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,797
Mr. Franval,

637
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,966
I called you in here
in the hope you could

638
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,342
give me some details

639
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,262
or some sidelights
on the Cartiers.

640
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,973
The Cartiers,
I see them around occasionally.

641
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,766
They’re nice people,
plenty of money.

642
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,685
You’ll never see them again.

643
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,019
They’ve been murdered.

644
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:48,728
(gasping)

645
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,813
Your magazine’s grapevine

646
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,023
doesn’t seem to be
working as it should.

647
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,025
That’s enough, Malou.

648
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,652
We found one of
your visiting cards

649
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:59,030
in the pocket of Mr. Cartier.

650
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,659
As a journalist,
do you have any idea

651
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,579
about a possible culprit?

652
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,997
Enemies?

653
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,874
Acquaintances?

654
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,627
Or something interesting
from your angle of

655
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,713
Dagger and Garter?

656
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,673
Nothing at all.

657
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,426
They were merely nice folks.

658
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,303
Incidentally, they were rich,

659
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,179
only they didn’t have
money to burn,

660
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,265
-far from it.
-Yes, yes, I understand.

661
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:28,018
Mr. Franval, I take it
you have no objections, then,

662
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:31,521
-to, uh, identifying the bodies?
-Huh!

663
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,941
Well, I find it unpleasant,
but if you insist, I will.

664
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,484
Call Durand.

665
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,529
Durand.

666
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,823
Take this gentleman
along to the morgue.

667
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,867
-Follow me, please.
-Right.

668
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:48,413
May I ask exactly how
the Cartier’s were killed?

669
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,165
They were murdered
with a dagger,

670
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,626
just like in
the stories you publish.

671
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,836
That’s interesting,
maybe I can use it.

672
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,923
We like authenticity,
good-bye.

673
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,174
I’m ready.

674
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,057
Well, Malou,

675
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,059
what do you think of him
for our culprit?

676
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,810
No comment.

677
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,229
(muffled screaming)

678
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:39,089
Mm, Maria Teresa.

679
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,925
Hm.

680
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,636
My darling,

681
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,263
why are you angry with me?

682
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,182
(Maria sighing)

683
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,185
-Why? Why?
-Do you really want to know?

684
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,981
I love you!

685
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,774
Maria.

686
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,443
Because you’re
a vicious old sadist,

687
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,487
-a homosexual.
-Yes, it’s true.

688
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,072
-A degenerate.
-Oh, yes!

689
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,740
-A dirty pig!
-It’s true.

690
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,993
-A shit eater, a swine!
-Yes, oh, yes.

691
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:11,246
-I disgust you.
-No! Let me go.

692
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,085
Come here.

693
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,673
On your knees.

694
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,802
(moaning)

695
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,304
Undress me.

696
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,599
Oh, mm.

697
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,019
(moaning)

698
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,699
Take off your clothes.

699
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,325
(groaning)

700
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,745
(moaning)

701
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,956
Maria.

702
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,043
Get undressed.

703
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,462
(moaning
and breathing heavily)

704
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,598
Oh, look at that.

705
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,308
Oh, yeah.

706
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,061
(breathing heavily)

707
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,937
You’re a filthy old lecher.

708
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:21,191
You are as disgusting
as a leper’s sores.

709
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,318
(moaning)

710
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:25,570
I hate you!

711
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,072
I abhor you!

712
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,532
Oh, Maria.

713
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,869
You make me vomit! Ah!

714
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,167
(moaning)

715
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,005
All right, stand up.

716
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,548
-Get on the bed...
-Maria.

717
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,343
...you old imp.

718
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:49,511
Oh, Maria.

719
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,263
-Oh, darling.
-You filth!

720
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,103
(breathing heavily)

721
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,073
(moaning)

722
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,854
(rooster crowing)

723
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,273
(suspicious music)

724
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,028
(moaning)

725
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,281
Yes, oh, Maria!

726
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,993
Oh, Maria, that’s--
Yes, yes, Maria.

727
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,412
(moaning and grunting)

728
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,961
-You dirty lecher!
-Maria!

729
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,922
-You old pervert!
-Yes, more, oh.

730
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,300
Travesty! Rapist!

731
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,427
(indistinct speaking)

732
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,846
(moaning and grunting)

733
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,265
(somber music)

734
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,491
(gasping)

735
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:18,701
Don’t be scared.

736
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,580
Don’t be afraid, countess.

737
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,333
I’ve come to save your soul.

738
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,419
You are a sinner!

739
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:32,257
I’m going to help you
expiate your sins.

740
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:33,841
Stand up!

741
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,638
Who are you?

742
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,682
What do you want?

743
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,562
Put your head down.

744
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,147
Put it down!

745
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,486
(screaming)

746
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,905
(grunting)

747
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,873
Ego te absolvo de peccatis

748
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,668
tuis in nomine Patris

749
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:12,338
et Filii

750
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,383
et Spiritus Sancti.

751
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,968
Amen.

752
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,733
(door closing)

753
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,152
(upbeat music)

754
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:23,284
So, you have a hunch
the police suspect you?

755
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,911
-That’s about it.
-Ha.

756
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,746
They must be out of their minds!

757
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:30,750
Even a cop could tell
you’re not a murderer.

758
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,502
You can say that again.

759
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,462
Anyway, I suspect
the murderer is

760
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,089
probably one of our crowd.

761
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,006
You could be right,

762
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,716
and I don’t wanna be
the next victim.

763
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,968
-That’s all we needed, huh.
-Our murderer doesn’t only

764
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:41,844
-kill women.
-Say he wants

765
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,429
equal numbers of men and women.

766
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,181
I heard that sex
maniacs like that

767
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,891
often have method
in their madness.

768
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,226
No, I think you’re wrong.

769
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:49,727
He’s a woman hater.

770
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,896
So they think
I did those killings

771
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,607
to provide authentic
material for my magazine.

772
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,692
After all, if I really had
committed those murders,

773
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,486
it wouldn’t be for
that sort of reason.

774
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,530
Well, I mean, I’d rather
rape Raquel Welch

775
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,907
or pull a hold-up, for example.

776
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,034
No, no, I can’t believe
that the police

777
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,786
really think that I did it,

778
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,121
only they’re
absolutely convinced

779
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,456
that I played a part in it
somewhere or other.

780
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,333
They think I lead a bad life.

781
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,377
-They’re not far off.
-Maybe!

782
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,337
(laughing)

783
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:19,549
Anyhow, what do you expect?

784
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,926
A cop could never understand

785
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,470
-our way of life.
-I guess not, Rose.

786
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,557
Yet, I think they’re
getting near the truth.

787
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,643
The motive behind these murders
has got something to do

788
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,270
with our quest for excitement

789
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,064
in the domain of black magic.

790
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,483
(laidback music)

791
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,286
Excuse me,

792
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,954
I thought Raymond was here.

793
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,581
Well, come in anyway.

794
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:52,957
Thank you.

795
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,006
I came to bring him
my new manuscript.

796
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,675
It’s supposed to go
in next week’s number.

797
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,097
I’d be very glad
if you would read it.

798
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,434
-Fine, I’d like to.
-It’s a true story.

799
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,187
Yes, I’ll read it!

800
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:17,482
I shall be honored

801
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:20,902
to have your opinion
as to its merits.

802
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,657
It’s a story of unhappiness.

803
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,661
You promise you’ll read it?

804
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,872
I already said so.

805
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:37,710
Thank you.

806
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,587
What for?

807
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,901
The darkness
of Mary Anna’s room

808
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,904
was pierced by
only a faint light.

809
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,864
On the other side of the street,

810
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:09,492
somebody moved a curtain.

811
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:13,287
The man’s tormented,
haggard face looked out.

812
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,666
His eyes expressed
his hopeless longing for her,

813
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:20,836
but his heart denied him
the courage to speak.

814
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,589
But his vigil was not in vain.

815
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,384
Mary Anna came into her room.

816
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,761
She was not alone this time.

817
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:32,473
Her partner in fleshly
lusts was with her.

818
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,809
The two girls
clasped each other,

819
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,644
and began to undress.

820
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:39,856
Their gleaming
bodies were exposed.

821
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,567
Hands clasped, mouths met

822
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:45,861
in forbidden kisses.

823
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,197
The man decided
to free Mary Anna

824
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,991
of the demon
that possessed her...

825
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,159
(thumping)

826
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,996
...to save her soul
at any cost.

827
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,999
He had the power to save her.

828
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,750
(knocking)

829
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,377
He opened the door

830
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,962
of his apartment

831
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:06,090
and directed his feet
toward her dwelling.

832
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,395
Ah!

833
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,064
Mr. Vogel!

834
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,942
-Good evening.
-But why are,

835
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,779
-why are you here?
-I have to speak to you.

836
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,284
Oh, all right.

837
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,416
(screaming)

838
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,835
(lively music)

839
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,939
(whimpering)

840
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,994
Anna.

841
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,371
-Mm-hm.
-Anna!

842
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,456
(shakily breathing)

843
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,875
(grunting)

844
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,922
(moaning)

845
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,263
-Anna. Anna.
-No.

846
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,808
No! Let me go!

847
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,310
-Anna!
-Let me go!

848
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,854
Oh!

849
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,697
Don’t be afraid.

850
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,907
I don’t want to kill you.

851
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,785
I don’t want to kill you!

852
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,204
(Vogel sobbing)

853
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,710
You’re possessed by the Devil.

854
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,211
Possessed by the Devil.

855
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,505
-No! No!
-You are possessed by the Devil.

856
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,716
You’re possessed by the Devil!

857
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,217
-No!
-I will exorcise you.

858
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,260
I will free you.

859
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,346
You must repent!

860
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,765
Anna, I’ll save you.

861
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,892
Anna, I’ll save you.

862
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:05,311
(screaming and grunting)

863
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,899
Anna! Anna!

864
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,318
(screaming)

865
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,784
I love you.

866
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,913
I love you.

867
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,915
You’re possessed

868
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,792
by the Devil,

869
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,003
but I love you.

870
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,589
I love you, Anna.

871
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,675
Love you.

872
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,302
No, stay down!

873
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,721
(crying)

874
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:53,859
Ego te absolvo

875
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,611
de peccatis

876
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,112
tuis...

877
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:02,076
...in nomine Patris

878
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,620
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

879
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,372
Amen.

880
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,791
(energetic music)

881
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,252
That’s funny.

882
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,045
What is?

883
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,338
Anna’s not back yet.

884
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,674
Maybe she’s out with Fred.

885
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:17,925
(doorbell ringing)

886
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,553
-There she is.
-Open it.

887
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,972
(energetic music)

888
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:29,812
Hello!

889
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,730
-Hello, Rose!
-Marina, Fred.

890
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,858
-Hi, there!
-What’s this in aid of?

891
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,818
We’ve come to pick up Anna.

892
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:36,902
But Anna’s not here.

893
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,279
We thought she was out with you!

894
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:39,613
That’s very strange.

895
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,950
We had a date to go
to the movies together.

896
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:46,787
-Yes, that’s strange.
-That’s just what I said to Ray.

897
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:50,082
Well, I suppose
she wants to be alone.

898
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,460
That doesn’t sound like her.

899
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,922
No, it doesn’t really.

900
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:59,675
I hope nothing’s
happened to her.

901
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,094
(energetic music)

902
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,104
(muffled music)

903
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,325
(moaning)

904
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,744
(breathing heavily)

905
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,501
(muffled music)

906
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:44,261
(breathing heavily)

907
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,099
(muffled music)

908
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,987
(phone ringing)

909
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:03,989
Oh, for God’s sake!

910
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,244
Hello?

911
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:10,746
Anna!

912
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,123
Where are you?

913
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:15,292
Where are you, honey?

914
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:16,919
You what?

915
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,587
You’re with a friend,
well, what friend?

916
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,172
Answer me!

917
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,844
She hung up.

918
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:26,929
So, what?

919
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:32,017
Well, she always has had
rather peculiar ways.

920
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,896
Only recently,
she’s gotten worse.

921
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,671
(typewriter clacking)

922
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:04,216
Inspector, the technical
services Interpol

923
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,427
sent our data into the computer,

924
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,886
and it came up with a few names.

925
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,806
Among them, I selected
Vogel, Paul, a Czechoslovak.

926
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,850
His real name is Paul Rosik.

927
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,853
He’s an unfrocked priest
escaped from an asylum.

928
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,896
He’s a writer,
and the German police

929
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,149
want him for
offenses against minors.

930
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,525
He could be our man.

931
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,361
My dear Malou,
you are the limit.

932
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,613
Perhaps this
poor Vogel is crazy,

933
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,116
but that doesn’t prove
that he’s the man we’re after.

934
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:31,910
Even though he happens
to live in the apartment

935
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,371
right across the street
from those girls

936
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,622
who are friends of Franval,

937
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,499
-the magazine publisher?
-So Vogel lives opposite,

938
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,460
so what?

939
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,170
Well, if that’s not enough,

940
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,088
go ahead and call me an idiot,

941
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,633
but I’d like a little talk
with Franval and his friends.

942
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,969
-They’re all yours.
-You’re in for a shock.

943
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,819
-I’d better see what he’s up to.
-Okay, I’ll hold the fort.

944
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,738
Malou?

945
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,531
(typewriter clacking)

946
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,957
(yawning)

947
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,584
Mm.

948
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,088
Mm.

949
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,889
Oh.

950
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,771
Mm.

951
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:49,738
Hmph!

952
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,203
Hm.

953
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:09,508
Raymond!

954
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,468
-Raymond, wake up.
-What do you want?

955
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,886
Anna isn’t back yet.

956
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,389
I’m beginning to get worried.

957
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,224
Well, she did phone after all.

958
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:19,518
She’s old enough
to know what she’s doing.

959
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:20,894
I know.

960
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,312
I know.

961
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,939
Maybe I’m being stupid,

962
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,607
but it’s just not like her.

963
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,734
This is the first time
she’s stayed away

964
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,445
for an entire night!

965
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,904
Well, what of it?

966
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,407
I’m scared, that’s all.

967
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,118
I’ve got a nasty feeling
something’s happened to her.

968
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:36,827
You think so?

969
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:39,246
(doorbell ringing)

970
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:42,457
Police.

971
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,586
-Good morning.
-The police?

972
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:49,089
-Good morning, inspector.
-Sorry for disturbing you.

973
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,675
What can we do
for you gentlemen?

974
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,052
This is Inspector Tanner
and his assistant.

975
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,470
Ah.

976
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,098
Did you know that
a certain Paul Vogel

977
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:02,144
has rented an apartment
just opposite yours?

978
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:05,063
No, why should we?

979
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,940
Did you also know

980
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,026
that for the last two days,

981
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,862
nobody seems to have
seen him around anywhere?

982
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,530
He has done a vanishing act.

983
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,532
That’s a coincidence.

984
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:16,909
Uh, Anna,

985
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,119
a friend who lives here with me,

986
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:22,247
has vanished as well.

987
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,541
If I can give you
a word of advice,

988
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:28,378
I’d cut out all of this nonsense
of yours with black masses.

989
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:32,466
Already four of
your group have died.

990
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:35,344
You might even be the next.

991
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,762
Mm.

992
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,617
Nomine Patris, et Filii,

993
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,494
et Spiritus Sancti.

994
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,037
Amen.

995
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:07,876
Oremus.

996
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,295
(singing prayer in Latin)

997
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,976
(Anna groaning)

998
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,866
My darling, Anna,

999
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:42,703
I absolve you of your sins.

1000
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:47,624
I absolve you!

1001
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:50,043
(tense music)

1002
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:54,423
Anna!

1003
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,925
(screaming)

1004
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,344
(tense music)

1005
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,199
(grunting and slapping)

1006
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,207
(spitting)

1007
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,626
(tense music)

1008
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,717
(screaming)

1009
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,136
(tense music)

1010
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,355
(inaudible)

1011
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,774
(tense music)

1012
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,289
Rose, come here!

1013
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,919
What is it?

1014
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:58,255
This is one of
Paul Vogel’s manuscripts.

1015
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:00,757
-Where did you find it?
-Right here.

1016
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,763
He talks about torture,
flagellation,

1017
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,598
crucifying a girl,

1018
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,726
exorcising the Devil,
read it!

1019
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:12,227
He talks of disemboweling,

1020
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,020
washing away sins with blood,

1021
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,856
and purification with a knife.

1022
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,820
-Well, what is it?
-I want to talk to you.

1023
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,072
What about?

1024
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,992
That last story of yours.

1025
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:29,286
Did it impress you?

1026
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,996
Yes, very much.

1027
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:33,623
Extremely sadomasochistic.

1028
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:35,208
But nevertheless,
it had the ring

1029
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,502
of authentic experience.

1030
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,965
What are you implying?

1031
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,593
That you know a lot too much
about these murders

1032
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:47,012
for a man who is innocent!

1033
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:48,388
You mean that I--

1034
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:49,556
You don’t understand.

1035
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:53,310
She’s very upset about
the disappearance of Anna.

1036
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,395
You mean Anna’s disappeared?

1037
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:57,731
You know she’s disappeared!

1038
01:27:57,731 --> 01:28:00,108
If you suspect me,
then go to the police.

1039
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,611
My conscience is clear.

1040
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,112
What about yours?

1041
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:07,157
Are your consciences
as clear as they should be?

1042
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:11,036
Our black masses, perhaps.

1043
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,454
Black masses?

1044
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:13,705
What do you mean?

1045
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,373
That’s right,

1046
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:16,958
if you’re interested,

1047
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,460
we’re holding one later tonight

1048
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,545
in the cloister of the Templars.

1049
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,256
It would give us
great pleasure if you attend,

1050
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:25,884
Mr. Vogel.

1051
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:29,262
I’ll come.

1052
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,223
Yes.

1053
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,058
I’ll come!

1054
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,309
(clattering)

1055
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,975
(rattling)

1056
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,178
Ah!

1057
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:54,598
(groaning)

1058
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,565
(grunting)

1059
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:17,037
(eerie music)

1060
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:57,327
(easygoing jazz music)

1061
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,598
(whipping)

1062
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:21,017
(easygoing jazz music)

1063
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,172
(music stops)

1064
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,140
Ah.

1065
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:07,647
Inspector! Inspector!

1066
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,275
You took a terrible chance,
you might have been murdered.

1067
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:14,237
You college boys never make
mistakes like ordinary cops.

1068
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,406
Oh, but this
mistake really hurts.

1069
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:17,866
I’ve been looking for you
because they’re holding

1070
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,617
another black mass.

1071
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:22,036
(easygoing jazz music)

1072
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,803
(manic distorted music)

1073
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,049
There goes the murderer.

1074
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:00,468
-He just killed Rose!
-Get in.

1075
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,679
(urgent music)

1076
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,765
(car speeding away)

1077
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:10,937
(urgent music)

1078
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,615
(sirens wailing)

1079
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:25,034
(car speeding)

1080
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:35,295
(siren wailing)

1081
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:25,595
(urgent music)

1082
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:38,650
We’ve got to hurry.

1083
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:40,360
Come, Anna!

1084
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,779
(urgent music)

1085
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:48,034
(screaming)

1086
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,001
(car approaching)

1087
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:03,675
-Hold it, Vogel!
-Anna! Anna!

1088
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:04,926
No!

1089
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,469
Let me go!

1090
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:09,180
Or I’ll kill her.

1091
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,015
I delivered them from evil.

1092
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,810
I freed them from
the power of the Devil.

1093
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:16,771
I don’t want to hurt this girl!

1094
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,189
I love her!

1095
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,358
I’ll save her soul
by my prayers.

1096
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:22,902
I’ll purify her of her sins!

1097
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:25,905
Don’t you understand?

1098
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:28,157
I am the sword of the Lord.

1099
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:30,952
I am the sword of the Lord!

1100
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:33,079
You must let me go.

1101
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:34,247
Let us go!

1102
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:36,833
-Give yourself up.
-Go away, or I’ll kill her.

1103
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,042
Don’t make me.

1104
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,669
You mustn’t!

1105
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:42,088
(gun firing)

1106
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:45,091
(screaming)

1107
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:56,394
Anna!

1108
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,026
You’ve got to admit, inspector,

1109
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:05,987
that we police college graduates
get the right idea sometimes.

1110
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:07,947
Mm-hm, well, uh,

1111
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:09,991
these egg-head cops,

1112
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,118
I’m not convinced.

1113
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:14,412
Maybe you are an exception.

1114
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,080
Good work, Malou.

1115
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,750
(car starting)

1116
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:21,169
(upbeat music)
