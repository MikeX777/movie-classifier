1
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,750
Can we do it ourselves
or should we call someone else?

2
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,920
There are enough of us.

3
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm going to let my sons know.

4
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,640
Bring them in.

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,974
We need help with the search on Friday.

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,000
After that, we are fine.

7
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,240
How many of you are going to fight?

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,120
Me.

9
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,120
Who’s taking care of the fire?

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
I'll take care of it.

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
Alright.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,840
Remember to bring your branding irons
and give them to Ramón.

13
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,000
Anything else?

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
Ok, then.

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,800
Let's try to capture
one hundred horses on Sunday.

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,040
<i>TROT

17
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,667
Want some help?

18
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,920
I'm missing the hole puncher.

19
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
I have two loose belts.

20
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
Is this it?

21
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
No.

22
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,800
What does it look like?

23
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,200
I'll find it myself.

24
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Do you ever shave?

25
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,760
My sister?

26
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
I haven't seen her.

27
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,680
He doesn't want to come.

28
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,760
Are we leaving already?

29
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

30
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Luis.

31
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,240
Go tell her.

32
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
I'm awake.

33
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
Do you want to come or not?

34
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,400
Who’s going?

35
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,920
Me, you and María.

36
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,080
Don't take too long.

37
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,320
Five minutes.

38
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,640
The greatness of your love

39
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,560
makes every instant
of our lives special.

40
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,080
You left this life
but not our hearts.

41
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,520
Mother, we have to carry on
without your presence

42
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,840
but your memory
will always remain with us.

43
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,600
Here we also have
something slightly shorter.

44
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,480
We'll miss you.
Your husband and sons.

45
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Better to leave it with just
the year and her name.

46
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
What about the picture frame?

47
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
With or without a photo?

48
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,160
What do you want it for?

49
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,920
How much is it?

50
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,640
If you bring the picture yourself,
it will be around 100 euros.

51
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The frame comes in
stainless steel too.

52
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,240
You won't have to worry
about it rotting away.

53
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,160
With the photo.

54
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,680
My Dad asked if you could come
to the bar on Sunday.

55
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,960
If you want to
and feel up to it, of course.

56
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,040
We are covered everywhere else.

57
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,560
I don't think I'll be able to.

58
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,320
Are you doing any rehab?
Any exercises or stretching?

59
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,160
I didn't want to.

60
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
Take sometime for yourself.

61
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,480
Get some rest and don't overworry
about the recovery.

62
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,840
Holidays?

63
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,600
They gave me 4 days off
and I came to help my dad.

64
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,320
Feels good to get
some fresh air as well.

65
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,840
High season starts next week, but fortunately
they're looking to hire more people.

66
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,480
We are leaving today.

67
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,640
We can leave tomorrow or the day after.
There's no rush.

68
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,480
She's feeling better already.

69
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,040
Do you want to tell them?

70
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
No.

71
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,920
You’d rather call them
than tell them in person?

72
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,080
It's still too soon.

73
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,440
And the situation is not ideal.

74
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,040
Great.

75
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,760
Where should I put it?

76
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,680
Out of the way.

77
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Did they feed the dog?

78
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
I guess.

79
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Do you want me to go?

80
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,800
I bought a ton of groceries for you.

81
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,800
The dog doesn't eat dog food.

82
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,200
What do you mean
he doesn't eat dog food?

83
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,840
I told you so.

84
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,200
We taught him wrong.

85
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,200
Fran came by.

86
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,840
Yes, he brought some bread.

87
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,840
He wanted you to go in to work.

88
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,800
I told him no.

89
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,960
Why didn't you ask me first?

90
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,560
Your back hurts.

91
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,920
I don't know how we managed
all these years without you.

92
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,720
Do we have to walk much more?

93
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes.

94
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,760
Why don't you talk to her?

95
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,360
It's not easy to talk to her.

96
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,240
Is it easy with you?

97
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,760
How's Luis?
Did he leave?

98
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,400
- Did something happen?
- We are fine, thank you.

99
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,000
Come on up.

100
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,160
- Shouldn't we throw these medicines away?
- No.

101
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,160
They expired three years ago.

102
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,320
- A, A, B, A, A.
- Throw it away.

103
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,360
Do you know what's the most
recent picture we have of her?

104
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
I'm going out for dinner
with my colleagues.

105
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,840
Have fun.

106
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,200
Careful with the wheelchair.

107
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,480
And turn the lights off.

108
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,120
Don't worry.

109
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,640
Ramón?

110
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,000
How's your sister?

111
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,160
Better.

112
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,120
When did he call you?

113
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Yesterday afternoon.

114
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,080
Do you take her out much?

115
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,000
She uses her right heel too much.

116
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,640
It's the heel bulb.

117
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,480
It's when they don't move
that they get injured.

118
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,440
Take her out on Sunday for a walk.

119
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,360
It'll do her good.

120
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,640
You have 10 minutes per room.

121
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,160
The beds are not wooden framed
but they're heavy.

122
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,200
You open the window.

123
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,720
You strip the bed.

124
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,960
Bathrooms, towels. Boom, boom, boom...

125
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,560
We tuck one sheet
underneath the other one.

126
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,640
It has to be tight.

127
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,760
That's when it first perfectly, you see?

128
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,600
How many rooms?

129
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,840
Normally around twenty.

130
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,760
During the high season,
you could have thirty at least.

131
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,680
You have to be quick.

132
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,040
Yes, ventilate, clean.

133
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,960
Check that everything is in order.

134
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,280
- They'll explain everything to me first, right?
- There's not much more to explain.

135
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,720
All good, Dad?

136
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,280
Yes.

137
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,520
Never heard of auto repair shops?

138
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,280
You were born to be rich.

139
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,400
She says she doesn't want it.

140
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,280
Give me some light over here.

141
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,480
If she doesn't want it,
I'll give it to someone who needs it.

142
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Is it looking bad?

143
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,040
The engine is fine,
that's what matters.

144
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,000
Go and check if the dough-mixer has finished.

145
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,520
Is it working or not?

146
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,040
Where are you!

147
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,440
This machine is not working properly.

148
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,160
It seems that you've forgotten how to work!

149
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,160
What are you doing!

150
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,160
I don't feel that well.

151
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,360
Take a pill!

152
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Are you serious about the hotel?

153
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,800
Marta told them about me.

154
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,440
Marta...

155
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,120
I knew you weren't planning
this all by yourself.

156
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,400
I'm not needed here any longer.

157
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,920
You've already left.

158
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,240
And you came back.

159
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,480
Let's see how long it takes
until you call me again.

160
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,240
Hey... hey... hey... Let's go!

161
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:53,720
- Testing... 1... 2... 3...
- Hey... hey... hey... Let's go!

162
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,120
Are you allowed to go up?

163
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,880
What are you doing?

164
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,360
She's not smiling in any of them.

165
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,320
Can I show this one to María?

166
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,040
This one?

167
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,120
Her hair was too long.

168
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,120
Luis!

169
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,760
We are upstairs!

170
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,480
These are our copies.

171
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,680
The courthouse will send you
all of this in a few days.

172
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,760
This is the report my colleagues filled out
at the scene of the accident.

173
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,040
The ambulance papers...

174
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,120
What do they say?

175
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,000
We estimate that the accident happened
a little before 7:30 in the morning.

176
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,880
Nobody called until 7:40.

177
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,480
That's when the grain delivery man
found the car.

178
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,726
The ambulance got there at 8:30.

179
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,120
Carme, that's when they took you.

180
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,360
This is the emergency room report:

181
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,360
contusions, post traumatic amnesia.

182
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,840
First tests...

183
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,760
Your mother's body wasn't taken away
until 10:30 in the morning.

184
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,480
Which is when the undertaker arrived.

185
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,520
You were already there, Ramón.

186
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,600
The autopsy?

187
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,360
It says she died of natural causes.

188
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,720
Multiple organ failure due to her disease.

189
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,920
It doesn't mention anything
about the accident.

190
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,800
She was dead already.

191
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,811
It's impossible to determine
the exact time of death.

192
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,360
There's always a margin of error.

193
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,160
It doesn't matter really.

194
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
<i>Well let's see... well let's see...

195
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,880
<i>Something's happening inside of me...
Because I spend my nights awake thinking of you

196
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,040
<i>My heart is beating, my love, for you

197
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,360
<i>I would row the river to Ribeira for you

198
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,640
<i>I would sing in the taverns for you
I would light up the stars, my love, for you

199
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,240
<i>My heart is beating, my love, for you

200
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,120
<i>I would row the river to Ribeira for you

201
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,560
<i>I would sing in the taverns for you
I would light up the stars, my love, for you

202
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,840
Left or right?

203
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,640
That way.

204
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,160
<i>There's a group of ten
around the meadow.

205
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,160
<i>We found fourteen towards the south.
And two are pregnant.

206
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,880
Have you seen anything?

207
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,240
They must be behind 'A Lobeira'.

208
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,960
There are some over there.

209
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,240
There are eight.

210
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,200
Ours?

211
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,440
There's a group of eight over here.

212
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,120
<i>Bring them closer!

213
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,640
Did you sell them?

214
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,920
<i>Let's try to move up and get those.

215
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,080
What!

216
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,240
With my Dad.

217
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,720
Looking for horses.

218
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,074
I don't know, about an hour or so.

219
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,240
An hour or so!

220
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,360
Look... there's a lot of wind!

221
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,800
Luis!

222
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,440
I'm getting a plastic bag.

223
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,960
What for?

224
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,800
So he can wrap it around the bandage
and shower because its soaked in sweat.

225
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,720
He'll shower tomorrow.

226
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,480
Are you leaving?

227
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,920
Luis!

228
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,000
He left again.

229
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,000
Where are you going?

230
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,280
If he comes back,
tell him that I'll be back in a while.

231
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,400
Has Ramón been here today?

232
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,080
Have you lost my brother?

233
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,080
He went to look for the horses
with the other men.

234
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,560
Can you give me some change, Lola?

235
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,520
Here.

236
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,120
What are you doing?

237
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,800
Did something happen?

238
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,200
Can you drive?

239
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,360
Can't you see?

240
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,800
Your leg?

241
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,320
In its place.

242
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,760
Are you going up
in the mountain tomorrow?

243
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,160
Yes.

244
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,680
When are you going to stop
this horse obsession?

245
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,680
You need to throw in the towel.

246
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,760
Throw yours if you want.

247
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,920
Aren’t you going?

248
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,960
Once you've seen one you've seen them all.

249
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,200
There's no reason for me to go.

250
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,920
More water anyone?

251
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,640
You look better.

252
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,160
Don't be scared of driving.

253
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm starting a new job on Wednesday.

254
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,680
At a hotel.

255
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,320
That's great.

256
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,080
What hotel?

257
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,400
One in Vigo.

258
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,320
Five days a week.

259
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,600
Eight hours.

260
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,160
I'll alternate mornings and afternoons.

261
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,880
Would you drive there
and back every day?

262
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,640
I'm going to rent a room.

263
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,240
We need to talk about this first,
don't we?

264
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
Go for it!

265
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,240
Leave her alone.

266
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,320
No, let's hear what he has to say.

267
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,480
He plays like shit.

268
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,640
<i>It was a 7th of July when I saw her...

269
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,040
<i>Her eyes burned through me
like hot coal...

270
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,560
<i>And I felt passion in my blood like running...

271
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,840
<i>with 7 bulls in San Fermín...

272
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,240
I thought you'd be at the church.

273
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,240
What do you want?

274
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,240
A liqueur.

275
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,760
What do you want?

276
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,840
A liqueur.

277
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,800
I'll be right there!
Take it easy!

278
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,320
Have you seen Luis?

279
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,520
He’s not coming out.

280
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,000
Sure...

281
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,440
Tell your dad that I'm better.

282
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,040
I'll be in tomorrow.

283
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,240
OK. Are you ready? All set?

284
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,560
Maestro, whenever you're ready.

285
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,600
Get down. You're going to fall.
What do you say?

286
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,240
<i>The... horse... trots forward
The horse trots backward

287
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,440
<i>The horse trots forward
The horse trots backward

288
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,400
<i>Eo... Eo Eo...Eo...

289
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,280
<i>Eo... Eo Eo Eo Eo... Ohhh...

290
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,360
What does it say?

291
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,760
<i>Eo... Eo Eo...Eo...

292
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,200
<i>Eo... Eo Eo Eo Eo... Ohhh...

293
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,080
Grab the waist of the person
in front of you to make snakes.

294
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,760
OK. And slither back and forth.
Are you ready?

295
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,600
Here we go!

296
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,760
And it says...

297
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,480
<i>The serpent slithers forward
The serpent slithers backward

298
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,240
<i>The serpent slithers forward
The serpent slithers backward

299
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,040
<i>Eo... Eo Eo...Eo...

300
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,360
<i>Eo... Eo Eo Eo Eo... Ohhh...

301
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,720
What does it say?

302
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,840
<i>Eo... Eo Eo...Eo...

303
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,800
<i>Eo... Eo Eo Eo Eo... Ohhh...

304
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,760
OK. Now, five in front.

305
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,480
Like that...

306
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,760
Walk backward...OK.

307
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,440
Are you ready? All set?
What does it say?

308
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,080
<i>The crab walks forward
The crab walks...

309
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,280
Careful.

310
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,280
The dog is barking, Luis.

311
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,280
Forget the fucking dog!

312
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,840
Carme! Get out!

313
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,960
There's someone outside.

314
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,680
Open the door!

315
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,800
How are you?

316
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,640
I'm perfectly fine.

317
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,200
Did he leave?

318
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,160
Go back to sleep.

319
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,280
Don't go out, please!

320
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,880
- Get out of the way.
- No.

321
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,560
- What can I get you?
- Some wine.

322
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,080
Thank you.

323
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,880
Yourself?

324
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,000
- Wine as well.
- None for me.

325
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,120
Cover his eyes.
